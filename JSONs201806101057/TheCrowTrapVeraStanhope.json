I very much enjoy the TV series based on these books and I have to say that they chose really good actors to represent both Vera and Joe. As I was reading I could just visualise them saying the words. Such a good book - 535 pages but all of them so good that I seemed to be finished in no time. I always find that with a really good mystery I just never want to put it down and this is a really good mystery.So good in fact that I honestly had no idea who the murderer was. The end came as a complete surprise to me although with hindsight there were clues aplenty.I always enjoy the way Ann Cleeves writes and I am also partly way through her Shetland series. I think this series may be even better:)"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol", "userReview": "The Hook - Begin at the beginning, that\u2019s my motto when it comes to most series mystery fiction. The Line(s) - \u201dThe rich onion flan might have come out of the freezer but Barbara had cooked it before it went in. It was topped with tomatoes and Parmesan and latticed with anchovies and olives. \u201cThe above lines may seem strange to quote but I was intrigued by this dish intrigued me. Searching for a recipe I saw a latticed anchovy-onion tart, but flan it was not. If anyone has every heard of this or has a recipe please let me know. Anchovies are grand in our family.The Sinker - I\u2019m not quite certain how I feel about The Crow Trap. I\u2019ve heard so many accolades to Ann Cleeves and this series that I thought I should get on the bandwagon. One thing I noticed immediately was that Cleeves had a way of drawing us in. One moment all was right with the world and in the next sentence all is changed. The title is explained in this way:\u201dThe trap was a large wire mesh cage with a funnel in the top. Inside a live, tame crow fluttered provocatively, inviting in another to defend its territory. Once in through the funnel there was no way out. Presumably they had to find some form of co-existence until the keeper came along to put the intruder out of its misery.\u201dAnn Cleeves is a storyteller and enjoys the use of words, painting a thorough portrait of her characters and environs. Detailed and atmospheric it is. I was surprised that the central character of the series, Vera Stanhope, herself doesn\u2019t truly appear until more than 200 pages go by. She makes a cameo appearance, showing up at a funeral of one of the victims being described as a bag lady. If you\u2019re paying attention you\u2019ll know its she. Murders, flawed characters and a complicated environmental plot weave in and out in this 500+ debut of the beloved, unconventional DI Vera Stanhope. She is a piece of work. This is not your typical political, sit behind the desk, Detective Inspector. She is odd gal out in dress and appearance, a bit unkempt, and older than many among her rank in the written pages of crime/mystery fiction. She loves to eat, often greasy food; you might even find a half eaten doughnut in her purse along with \u201dpapers, keys, photo, five brios\u201d. She is outspoken to say the least, barges her way in, has no problem ordering people around for a cup of tea, she\u2019d have preferred a beer if available and expects her team to \u201cget on with it\u201d. But she gets results; she\u2019s comfortable with herself and is no one\u2019s fool. It's even hard to peg this woman in any hole. Literary novel, suspense fiction, crime or mystery? it's a bit of a mix. The more I think about it, the more I have decided I could easily become a fan of both Stanhope and Cleeves. It often takes me a bit to get into the rhythm of a new series. Vera Stanhope, her eccentricity and her territory of Northumberland are bound to grow on me."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda", "userReview": "My first introduction to author Ann Cleeves and her protagonist Vera Stanhope did not go well.The book first delves into the lives of three women who are sharing temporary quarters while conducting an environmental assessment prior to digging a quarry. One of them is killed. Each woman was given a lengthy chapter. Vera shows up officially to investigate at the start of Part Two, about halfway through. The book is overly long at 535 pages and generally plods along to the conclusion.I checked reviews. Many abandoned this book. Many loved it. I\u2019m in the meh camp. Several readers had prior experience with Cleeves and feel this book is not typical of her. They encourage others to take heart and continue with the series.

I knew that I just had to get along with Ann Cleeves, because I'm such a huge fan of both television series based on her books. So I decided to jump into the audiobook, and it was perfect! I chose to start it on a solitary road trip into the quiet of the forest. Such an atmospheric setting for an atmospheric book. Probably one of the slowest mysteries I've read in a long time, but so fulfilling and worth it. I found myself juggling the audiobook and physical book during times when I couldn't listen. I had to know how it would end, and of course it wasn't anything like what I'd conjured in my imagination.What's always fascinated me is the psychology behind crime and murder, and that's what makes the Vera books so much more than a British procedural novel. She really draws you into the characters, whether they realize that they'll be embroiled in murder or fall victim themselves. Definitely a character study. Can't wait to continue the series."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24360539-thomas", "userReview": "This is book 1 in the series. I enjoyed it and rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars. It is a long book, 535p., and moves slowly at times, while the author builds the scene. The book is told from the perspective of 4 women:Rachael--1 of 3 women conducting a wildlife assessment to determine whether or a quarry would kill off any protected plants/animals. She has issues with Peter Kemp, whose company is running the assessment. Peter had an affair with her in order to steal her work. He then dumped her and married someone else.Anne--the second of 3 women conducting the assessment. She is having an affair with the owner of the quarry firm. Grace--The third woman doing the assessment. She is the product of foster homes and socially awkward. She has reconnected with her father.Vera--Detective Chief Inspector(DCI) in charge of the investigation, when Grace is found dead.I was not sure who the killer was until the end.This book is more of a study in how people interact and their relationships than a murder mystery.Some quotes:\"Anne's sexual appetite was legendary.\"Vera leaves the two women to continue their work as decoys. In Rachel's words: \"Like the crow, she thought, in the trap.\" This series has been adapted for tv and is found in the US on PBS.

The extremely talented Brenda Blethyn is excellent playing the role of Vera in the TV show and it\u2019s definitely worth a watch. If you enjoy English murder mysteries, this is an extremely well written, engaging read and a great start to the series. Although over 500 pages long, it doesn't feel like it as the writing reads easily and the story flows along nicely. Vera doesn't appear until about two thirds the way through the book but she is definitely worth the wait! I love the normality of her character, her straight talking, no-nonsense approach to everything. I was definitely second guessing who the murderer was all of the way through and still never got it right! Full of interesting and varied characters with absorbing back stories, lots of red herrings and ultimately beautiful descriptions of the North East of England, this is an ideal English murder mystery which kept me wanting to keep reading on until the end. I have since bought all the books in the series. Loved it! and I recommend this series if you love series like Morse, Frost, Midsomer Murders etc."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara", "userReview": "This is the first Vera Stanhope novel. It took a long time to get the the point when Stanhope enters the story which is my reason for 4 stars. There are characters who hide their past and even their identity. There is an early suicide which leads Vera to investigate hidden links between characters. The setting is the North Pennines which are in County Durham, Northumberland, North Yorkshire, Cumbria.  Vera's backstory in the book varies somewhat from the TV series. And although she is not a fashion plate on TV, she is described in a way in the book which makes her sound like she could be mistaken for someone who is homeless, and living on the street.  The audiobook is pleasantly narrated by Anne Dover. I can't comment on the accuracy of the accent. I have a friend who lives in Northern England and finds the accent of the TV character, Vera Stanhope, quite inaccurate. I'm venture a guess that there is quite a lot of variation in accents in the region. Living in Boston for many years, I found there were many differences from neighborhood to neighborhood."}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "As a long time fan of Ann Cleeves Shetland series does it feel a bit odd to admit that it has taken me this long time to read a book from her Vera Stanhope series.

I have fallen in love with the tv series starring Brenda Blethyn and I was so excited to start a new mystery series. Now of course I am wondering if I should even bother with the second book in the series, \"Telling Tales.\" As other reviews have noted, Vera doesn't even show up in this book til the 40 percent mark (Kindle version) and then we don't even get a Vera POV until I think it was around the 75 percent mark. Instead we focus on three women and go back and forth between two of the women (after one of them is murdered). I have to say the final reveal of who is behind the murders that popped up in this book and why were a bit hard to take. I didn't feel like any of the characters were very well developed besides the three women the book decides to focus the most on anyway. \"The Crow Trap\" follows three women: Rachel, Anne, and Grace. These three women are in Northumberland in order to do an environmental survey. There is a possibly quarry that may be built and there are sides for it and against it. When a local farmer's wife commits suicide, it seems to be the catalyst that causes everyone else to realize that maybe something else is going on here. When one of these three women is found murdered, DI Vera Stanhope appears on scene and decides to lay a trap to catch the murderer. Eh if I have to pick one woman that didn't drive me up the wall, it would be no one. Seriously. Rachel was aggravating, Anne and her personal life..yikes. And Grace's was the most interesting to me, but I honestly had a hard time with that character cause we pretty much skipped over why she was on the survey team until almost the end. I didn't get it myself based on what we found out about her and her real family since it didn't feel like something her father would really care about. It just came out of nowhere. Vera was a loudmouth who I had to question her intelligence at times. She didn't seem that bright until the book pivoted to her POV. And even then...just a bit uncouth. I don't know. She is not acting how the tv show Vera acts. There seems to be no subtlety at all.There are other characters in this one, but I refuse to go back and look them up. I just didn't find them that intriguing. The writing was okay, this book was way too long. The flow as up and down. Going from Rachel, Anne, and Grace and showcasing the same timeline via different POVs made me want to pull my hair out. I started to become bored while reading this. Rachel deciding to investigate with Vera's blessing/derision wasn't much help either. You start to wonder what is going on and how is it all connected. The ending didn't make a lot of sense to me. I felt like it just came out of nowhere. I had to re-read that part a few times to even get the gist of what is happening. And you don't even get a good sense of closure. The book just abruptly ends."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5779782-ellen", "userReview": "The Crow Trap by Ann Cleeves.This is the 1st in the Vera Stanhope series. This book is divided into sections describing in detail 3 women: Rachel, Anne and Grace. These 3 women are connected by their endeavors in an environmental project.

The story begins with Rachel discovering Bella had committed suicide. Shocked by this tragedy she is interviewed by the local police. Joe, Vera's right hand man, begins the investigation.

Although it is not until over two-hundred-pages into the novel that she becomes known to the guests at remote Baikie Cottage, bringing with her a brash demeanour and distinctly unfeminine appearance, she more than makes up for her late entrance. Originally published in 1999, this is a timeless case with a host of suspects confusing matters and keeping readers on their toes! Baikie's Cottage is the property of a charitable trust left by illustrator and spinster, Constance Baikie, in order to encourage environmental education and research and is the admittedly basic accommodation that plays host to the ensuing mystery.Although I had picked up on Vera's domestic circumstances from reading later books in the series, it was wonderful to hear Ann Cleeves giving a pr\u00e9cis of her history and revealing more about her father, Hector, and demonstrating her understanding on environmental matters. In The Crow Trap Vera is reunited with the hill farms and countryside that she knows so well and sees herself back in Baikie's cottage, a place she knows well, with her father and the elderly lady whose home it was sharing a common interest in the illegal pursuit of stealing birds eggs from their nests. After her mother died in childbirth, Vera spent her youth trekking after her father as he tramped the hills pursuing his passion, with their only close neighbours and contact being with the stationmaster and his wife, Mrs Gregory, whom was the maternal figure in Vera's life. Since their departure and her fathers death, Vera has changed nothing about the desolate and lonely house she avoids spending time in, complete with New Age hippy neighbours who have taken her under their wing. Vera's close working relationship is with her Sergeant and renowned teacher's pet, Joe Ashworth, and the point of view of her harried colleagues is largely omitted is the first instalment but in subsequent novels it has become more prominent. The benefit is the opportunity of seeing and hearing Vera musing on her own upbringing though is a valuable insight into her gruff persona. Although this first introduction to the inspired creation of Inspector Vera Stanhope does stretch to just over five-hundred-pages, it is one of the most satisfying and juiciest cases with the opportunity of seeing Vera amongst the rugged countryside that she grew up with.Brilliantly constructed in three parts, the first sees three very different women thrown together into the uncomfortably close proximity of Baikie's Cottage in order to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment prior to the proposed development of a quarry across the landscape. First to arrive is Rachael Lambert, team leader for the first time, still raw from her manipulation by the caddish Peter Kemp, boss of the environmental consultancy that she works for. A return to Kimmerston will see Rachael reunited her with her psychology spouting mother, Edie Lambert and with close friend, Bella Furness, wife of Dougie, the farmer at Black Law. Since Dougie's stroke, Bella has resolutely managed the farm and was in love with her husband and her life, hence when Rachael arrives only to be met by her hanging corpse she refuses to believe that her friend would have taken her own life, preferring instead to suspect that this could have something to do with the impending development plans by Slateburn Quarries, where Dougie's own son is now employed. As readers see the unfolding week through the eyes of first earnest Rachael, then move on to married and over-confident man eater, botanist Anne Preece, never short of a flip response and finally through to withdrawn mammal expert, Grace Fulwell, the same period is retold through three very differing pairs of eyes. With all three women having their own closely guarded reasons for undertaking the assessment and staying tight-lipped about their reasons, the tension and stifled atmosphere that pervades generates genuine suspense. This first part ends with the discovery of the body of Grace, only for the second part to see the no-nonsense DI Vera Stanhope enter proceedings, never afraid of probing or phrasing a downright nosy question. Hearing each of the women's reasons for being drawn to the impact assessment means the length of five-hundred-pages rattles past and never seems drawn out, with Cleeves providing a masterclass in entwining psychological suspense within the police procedural genre.Vera is in her pomp as the second part of the novel opens, firing off questions, gossiping and manipulating with a devious ploy for the two remaining assessors, Rachael and Anne, to continue their work. After all, if the motive for the murder is a corporate act of intimidation, the abandonment of the assessment project will be serving the murders desired purpose. The title of this first outing is also one of the most appropriate, with The Crow Trap being a metaphor for the sitting target of two lone females almost acting as a siren in drawing further danger into the remote region surrounding Black Law farm. As Rachael refuses to believe Bella's suicide was her own idea, Vera uncovers every stone and her abrupt stage manner sees her wrong-foot everyone she encounters. Part three is left wide open for DI Vera Stanhope to create merry hell for her bosses with her unorthodox methodology along the way. It is not only Vera and her Sergeant, Joe Ashworth who are brilliantly brought to life, it is the entire cast whose lives are disentangled against the unflinching backdrop of the hill farms. With ulterior motives and hidden secrets waiting to be exposed, Ann Cleeves keeps the shocks coming and combines this with the amusement to be had as the strident Vera leaves her indelible mark on the landscape. The Crow Trap is a character driven and thoroughly pleasurable novel with a gossipy overtone and an infectious humour. Vera shrewdly massages egos and smashes others as she plays to the audience with a showmanship that is worthy of the stage.Television viewers who moan about the dour and wind-swept Northumberland landscapes would be thoroughly well-served by becoming acquainted the character that Cleeves has created in novel form. It is only through reading her work that I have come to appreciate the multifaceted talents of DI Vera and her long-suffering sounding board, Joe Ashworth. In a world where so much of crime fiction is driven by the dysfunctional male lead detectives, Vera is an inspired creation and no other author comes close to Ann Cleeves for extracting the secrets that give rise to murder and mayhem. I will shed a silent tear when feisty Vera is shepherded into retirement as she never fails to inspire, humour and touch me in a way no other police lead can."}, {"userName": "Polly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7219565-polly", "userReview": "Well I finished The Crow Trap in the end, partly because after the character of Vera Stanhope (inspector) was introduced the pace picked up a little. For my taste there were too many unlikeable characters swirling in a morass of damaged interpersonal relationships; absent, obsessed &/or alcoholic fathers, sibling rivalry &/or manipulation, suicidal mothers and others. I also felt that Vera\u2019s character was a bit of an attempt at a female version of Inspectors Frost (R. D. Wingfield), Daziel (Reginald Hill) or even more recently Lamb (Mick Herron) and the character didn\u2019t quite come off.

True to Ann Cleeves' writing style, this focuses as much on character development and on painting a picture of the landscape as it does on the murder mystery.These mysteries take place in Northumberland, England on the border of Scotland. In this story, an environmental study is taking place in an area where a developer wants to dig a quarry. Three women are conducting the study, staying in a cottage in the area. Cleeves takes almost half the book introducing us to these three women, who are in a vulnerable situation because of the politics of the quarry/survey. I was surprised and a little irritated that so much time was spent getting to know these people who clearly would not be part of future books. It's an unusual approach - most first books in a series spend a lot of time setting up the recurring cast of characters! In this case Vera and her team don't show up until midway through the book. In the end, I felt satisfied with the approach she took. The reader becomes invested in these three, any of whom might be murdered and any of whom might be the murderer. There are secrets from the past, clandestine relationships in the past and present, family dynamics, politics, a suicide, a couple of murders and a surprise whodunit along with Cleeves' trademark painting of the environment. This book came in at 500+ pages or 14 hours of listening, in my case, which always seems excessive to me for a mystery. Seeing that subsequent entries in the series are in the 350-ish page count encourages me to continue. Of course, I'm seeing the fabulous Brenda Blethyn as Vera and can easily picture the area from the tv shows!"}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45128-terri", "userReview": "I have loved the series Vera for a long time. but now I finally got around to reading the first book in the series.

It was interesting to read the book & discover that she had played the role very true to the character as written by the author.

Second thing, I've not seen the television adaptations, so my views aren't coloured by these.If this had been my first Ann Cleeves, it might have been my last. She writes well, but in this instance could have benefitted from some serious editing. This is not a story that merits 550 pages. It's a slow burn. Almost half the story is taken up in introducing the plot from the standpoint of the three environmental scientists who come together to survey a piece of land in the northern Pennines, which might become the site of a new quarry. On the whole, there was too much information. DI Vera Stanhope, fat, unhealthy and acerbic only makes her entrance after the three women have had their story told. The plot continues with its twists and turns. But did I believe the denouement? No, not really. It's often good to feel that a story's clues were there for us to spot if only we'd been cleverer. Here, it felt more like the author herself had invented the twist that solves everything at quite a late stage, because she'd dug herself into a hole from which she was having trouble extricating herself.Yes, an absorbing-at-times read. A memorable one? No."}, {"userName": "Mike Sumner", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18145153-mike-sumner", "userReview": "I don't often do things back to front but here is one such case. I enjoyed the Vera Stanhope series on TV and when I came across 'The Moth Catcher' in Waterstones I bought a copy and thoroughly enjoyed it. This is number seven in the series. I took a step back and read number six, 'Harbour Street'. Both copies were liveried in the TV tie-in covers and when the remaining five were so issued I jumped in and bought the lot. I like book covers. So here I was, ready to read this the first in the series, first published in 1999. I was slightly daunted with the prospect as this book weighs in at 550 pages but I need not have been concerned as this is a very absorbing read - a slow burner, full of atmosphere and suspense, a well-drawn cast of characters and a satisfying plot. If I had read this without having known anything about DI Vera Stanhope I would have been rather taken aback at this portrayal of a dowdy curmudgeon, certainly nothing like the woman played by Brenda Blethyn in the TV series. (By book six Stanhope seems to have mellowed somewhat).I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have done that and I shall look forward to reading number two in the series: 'Telling Tales'."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29698492-susan", "userReview": "Hmmm... How to rate and review this one? There was nothing that I hated about it but nothing that was exceptionally compelling to read either. This book took me forever to read. It was one of the ones that I kept reading, and reading, and reading and never seeming to get any closer to the end. At times, I forgot what the mystery was about; I forgot the plot line and had to read the blurb to remind myself it was a murder mystery. But at the same time, I kept reading and reading. Again, nothing to hate about it. Some parts were even engaging. But, really, it was just WAY too long. I generally enjoy having details about the characters, setting, etc. But Cleeves overdoes it, giving minute details about people, places, and minor events, that contribute little to the story, and where these extraneous details detract from the reading of the book overall.Strangely, at some point I think I might pick-up the next book in the series because I am curious where it goes. But, after book 1, book 2 of this series is not one that I would ever clamour to look up and read. Then again, maybe I will cheat and just get the TV versions on DVD from my library..."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4380068-bill", "userReview": "Definitely a different mystery writer. I enjoyed it very much. I had seen a couple of episodes of the TV series, Vera previously and Ann Cleeves had received some recommendations from my goodreads acquaintances. So I finally got the first book and took the time to read it. Quite different from the series which is, of course, Vera-centric. In the book, you don't really meet Vera Stanhope until about half way through and she is almost peripheral as we explore the other women's lives and the events which are being investigated. Very methodical, interesting way of developing a story and ultimately the solving of the mystery is almost incidental. Vera is an interesting copper, not like any others I've read about, grumpy, a busy-body, but still with an intuition towards solving the crime. I enjoyed this and will read other Ann Cleeves stories."}, {"userName": "Rachael", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9542895-rachael", "userReview": "There are a several reasons why I chose to read this book:1. It was on offer (often a deciding factor for me)2. I like thrillers and mystery/detective stories3. It's the first in a series (always a good place to start)4. I enjoy watching the TV series, Vera, which is based on this series of books5. It features a character called RachaelAnd now after finishing this book, I'm questioning my choice. It was slow in places and there was quite a lot of detail that could have been cut. \u2702\ufe0f Sometimes, with this genre of book, detail does help to build the atmosphere. But, here, I felt there was too much minutiae that didn't really add to the story. It was also boring at times. It could have had major relevance to the plot but I didn't feel engaged enough to realise that.Although I was kept in suspense guessing whodunnit, the ending was quite abrupt and rushed.Another problem I have is that I don't think there was enough of the main series character, DI Vera Stanhope. She doesn't appear for ages and initially only for a fleeting moment. I would have liked more focus on her detective work.If this book had fewer pages and more Vera, it may have made a difference and I might have given it more than 3 stars.

First case involving Inspector Vera Stanhope, and in this book we actually don't even meet her until halfway through the book. Initially the story is told from the viewpoint of each of three young scientists, women staying at a remote rural cabin to do scientific research counting plants, birds and mammals prior to a quarry being expanded in the area. As often is the case when big business meets resistance from local people wanting to preserve the environment, things get intense in the area, and even worse when one of the young women ends up dead. Is the murder to do with something related to the quarry, to the woman's job, or is this something personal, rooted in her past and ties to some of the locals?
