They didn't rely on technology or weapons but on manners and intellect. Now there are new batches of washed up villains and when you get that many in one place, well, it's definitely not bound towards a fairy-tale ending.A fun little what-if story supposing so many well known villains all ended up together and how interactions would play out."}, {"userName": "Robb", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120948-robb", "userReview": "Hear my review on my podcast: http://www.bookedpodcast.com/?p=5406"}, {"userName": "AK Mama Reads", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2014182-ak-mama-reads", "userReview": "Another quick, though not at all perfunctory, read from S.G. Browne's new Kindle Singles selections, Dr. Sinister's Home for Retired Villians brings us into the lives of many famous evil doers and what they are up to after ceding their reign to the newest terrors. Our narrator gives us a tour of the home along with his recounting of recent events, and an anecdote or two. In such few words, you don't often find both humor and profound wisdom, but Browne gives us exactly these qualities and much more in his second short story exclusive to Kindle. When you're no longer committing atrocious acts, how will your occupy your time? More likely than not, the answer won't be a huge surprise, but one you'll enjoy all the same."}, {"userName": "Cassie-la", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10214072-cassie-la", "userReview": "ORIGINALLY POSTED: https://bibliomantics.com/2016/08/28/...Narrated by the Dr. Jekyll, Browne\u2019s second short story release is set at a retirement home for villains feeling the sting of their irrelevancy. Hard at work on his memoirs \u2014 he has met the likes of Walter White and Lord Voldemort after all \u2014 Jekyll and his pals Moriarty and Dracula are struggling to deal with being shunned for their classic villain status by newer offerings like Agent Smith. Much like his amazing book Big Egos, this story\u2019s strength lies in its references."}, {"userName": "R.T.

This one was really fun to read! I wish it was longer but I understood it from the beginning that this was a quick read. This take on villains throughout pop culture was fun and I hope he returns to this world with another story even if it's a short one. Well worth a dollar and it got me to want to check out more works by the author again so mission accomplished!"}, {"userName": "Thomas Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50030667-thomas-joyce", "userReview": "Heard about this short story and Browne's other two recent releases on the Booked podcast and, having wanted to read his work for a while, this seemed like the perfect way to get a taste. I loved the original take on the villains of literature living in a retirement home. The personal traits Browne gave each were very entertaining and the reasoning offered for each was wonderful. A fun and well-written story.

It\u2019s hard enough being a diabolical relic, stuck in your outdated version of treachery, all plans of world domination fading in your rear-view magic mirror. But when you have to share meals and movie nights with dozens of other washed-up scoundrels, miscreants, and evildoers like Captain Hook, the Big Bad Wolf, and the Wicked Witch of the West, conflicts are bound to arise. As a general rule, villains tend to be sore losers. And at Dr. Sinister\u2019s, you never know when someone might turn the swimming pool into a shark pit or bring a death ray to Taco Tuesday.", "title": "Dr. Sinister's Home for Retired Villains", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31424720-dr-sinister-s-home-for-retired-villains", "average": 3.85, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1470889074l/31424720.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2129854.S_G_Browne", "name": "S.G.
