This is one of the few World War I naval actions I have read about. This battle took place 31 May and 1 June 1916 off the coast of Denmark. The combat involved steam propulsion, iron hulls, armor plate, gunfire control, explosive shells, advanced mines and most important rapid fire, long-barrel, turret-mounted, large- caliber, long- range naval guns. The goal of the battle for Germany was to brake the century-long dominance of the sea by the British. The Germans failed to do so.I noted with great interest that the author is related to Admiral John Rushworth Jellicoe (1859-1935). At the Battle of Jutland, Admiral Jellicoe was commander of the Grand Fleet. His handling of the fleet was controversial, but he made no serious mistakes during the battle. The Grand Fleet consisted of 151 ships. The battle was the largest clash of dreadnoughts during WWI. The German fleet disengaged from the battle and retreated to port. The German High Seas Fleet was commanded by Admiral Reinhard Scheer and consisted of 99 ships. The British public thought Jellicoe should have destroyed the German Fleet. Admiral Jellicoe later on in WWI introduced the convoys to get supply ships past the U-boats. Admiral Jellicoe pushed for the modernizing of the naval ships and was a proponent of the gunnery fire control systems and the Dreyer\u2019s fire control table for computing firing solutions for the ships\u2019 guns.The author focuses on Admiral Jellicoe and the British Battle Cruiser Fleet Vice Admiral David Beatty. Jellicoe uses charts and diagrams to illustrate the details of the 12-hour battle. 14 British ships and 11 German ships were sunk. Jellicoe states the main reason the British, despite greater numbers, failed to achieve a decisive victory was the poor communications between Jellicoe and Beatty during the actions. The author covers this in great detail. He points out a similar communications problem occurred with the United States Navy during the 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf in World War II. The author claims the tension between Admiral Jellicoe and Beatty was the reason the German Fleet escaped Jellicoe\u2019s trap.The book is well written and researched. The book contains maps and illustrations as well as photographs to help with the understanding of the battle. The book 402 pages and published in 2016 by the Naval Institute Press."}, {"userName": "Derek Nudd", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47198036-derek-nudd", "userReview": "Nick Jellicoe has a fair take on the battle, its key players and aftermath while confining discussion of the more erudite or technical points to box-outs that the casual reader can skip if (s)he wishes. (But is a casual reader going to pick up a book of this size?)Despite the name he takes an admirably even-handed approach to what he calls the 'unfinished battle,' or what might equally be called the 'Second Battle of Jutland' - the unneccessary, vitriolic and destructive dispute between supporters of Admirals Jellicoe and Beatty which rumbles on still. While neither finished the day smelling of violets, when boiled down to essentials both did what they had to do. We should also hesitate to pass judgement from comfort, safety, hindsight and a different century's values on people who had none of those things.Stepping away from my soapbox and back to the book, the biographical sections might have been organised a bit better (illustrated with timelines perhaps?) and it would have been good to see a little more prominence given to German use of metal cartidge cases and the story of the British submarines trying to intercept the returning High Seas Fleet. These are minor quibbles however."}, {"userName": "Bruce Horton", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55844567-bruce-horton", "userReview": "Some interesting personal notes but very little that was new - Andrew Gordon's The Rules of the Game remains the one to beat"}, {"userName": "David Bird", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11658189-david-bird", "userReview": "To my mind this book combined real achievements with real disappointments.The real achievements are the combination of a vast quantity of material, including much from German sources to trace the history of a complex battle, and the integration of insights from a personal connection with one of the principals with a reasonably balanced view of all of the leading figures. The real disapointments are mainly down to editing, or rather the lack of it, and what seems like an unclear idea of the intended audience. Digressions, including repeated re-examination of polemical points distract from the flow. The digressions often present odd chronological leaps with comparisons to future events that non-specialists cannot be expected to know. There are also asides clearly aimed at specialists, but there is much of the text that seems aimed at the non-specialist. A particularly unfortunate editorial decision is the structure of the chapters comparing Fisher/Tirpitz, Jellicoe/Beatty, and Scheer/Hipper. In each case, the compared lives are presented in essentially alternating paragraphs, making for unnecessarily dificult reading and obscuring the broader trends. As noted, books strengths include subtantial use of German sources. The one thing that I wished it had had more of, given the importance of intelligence and communication failures to Jellicoe's need to make command decisions in realtive ignorance, was an analysis of communications during the battle between Scheer and his subordinates. The edition that I read was published by Seaforth in the UK and lacks the subtitle, but bears the same ISBN."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10285868-tom", "userReview": "Jellicoe's magisterial study is as engaging as it is erudite, something which will enchant both the scholar and the general reader. The student of the battle will find brilliant, highly detailed commentary and analysis from the grandson of \"that\" Jellicoe, while the more casual reader will find lots of intriguing information about the last great conflict of the battle cruisers and \"battleships\" ( or dreadnoughts, if you prefer! ) When you've read JUTLAND, you'll immediately put it on your bookshelf so you can find it again...and again!

What was in fact a strategic victory stands out starkly against the background of bitter public disappointment in the Royal Navy and decades of divisive acrimony and very public infighting between the camps supporting the two most senior commanders, Jellicoe and Beatty. Based on the latest research, \"The Unfinished Battle\" retells the story of the battle from both a British and German perspective, clarifying the context of Germany s inevitable naval clash. It also traces the dispute known as the Jutland Controversy that ensued until Admiral Jellicoe s death in 1935. Author Nick Jellicoe is uniquely placed to tell the story of Jutland. His naval connections are strong: his father, the second Earl Jellicoe served as First Lord of the Admiralty while his grandfather, Sir John Jellicoe commanded the Grand Fleet for the first two years of the war, from 1914 to 1916. Sir John was famously described by Churchill as being the only man who could have lost the war in an afternoon. \"", "title": "Jutland: The Unfinished Battle: A Personal History of a Naval Controversy", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32331581-jutland", "average": 3.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1475430770l/32331581.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14653065.Nick_Jellicoe", "name": "Nick Jellicoe"}], "type": ["History", "War", "Military"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32331581-jutland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27757735-jutland"]}
