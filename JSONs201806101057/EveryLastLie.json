I truly love how fleshed out her characters are and how the suspense just builds from beginning to end. This one was very different than her previous three novels. Maybe it was because Clara was in a similar walk of life as I am (young mother with 2 small kids) or maybe it was because she put some of my worst fears on paper, but I really connected with the story. I think readers will be split over the ending; personally I loved it but I can see how some might be expecting a different direction. This ended up being a buddy read with the lovely Sam @ Clues and Reviews (she loved it to by the way) and trust me, you\u2019re going to want to have someone to talk to once you finish it.My mood has been solely focused on slow burning novels at the moment; I\u2019m not sure what the reason is behind this. Maybe it\u2019s a need for a deeper connection with my characters, possibly it\u2019s because I have had so many review copies to churn out that my inner book nerd is craving something I don\u2019t feel pressured to fly through; whatever the reason, THIS book satisfied that desire. Please be aware that there is nothing fast paced about this novel; it needs to be savored and enjoyed slowly as it is heavily character driven. I\u2019m amazed that a book can lack so much action and yet captivate my attention so fully. Even with it being a slow paced read, I still found myself not wanting to put it down, only wishing I had more time to read continuously. So this is your warning for those who like to constantly state that slow books=boring books; this psychological suspense won\u2019t be for you.THAT ENDING. I\u2019m sure it was just me, but I was completely taken by surprise with that ending. Maybe it\u2019s that I\u2019ve read so many twisty novels of suspense lately that keep trying to out-do each other with elaborate, over-the-top schemes that this finale was refreshing and powerful to my psyche. I won\u2019t say more to avoid spoilers or causing your mind to drift in any one direction, but I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s the type of ending that will be controversial amongst readers; you\u2019ll either love it or you\u2019ll hate it. I can\u2019t get into WHY I loved it, but just know that I did. It was a risky move of Kubica and I applaud her for going outside the genre\u2019s comfort zone to give us something fresh. Note- outside of genre\u2019s comfort zone is not referring to a supernatural/paranormal twist. Highly recommended to suspense readers looking for a realistic, moving suspense that deals with the domestic struggles of one young family; if this is you then look no further.*Many thanks to the author for providing my copy; it was a pleasure to provide my honest thoughts here."}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "This was another enjoyable read by one of my favourite authors, Mary Kubica!EVERY LAST LIE by MARY KUBICA is an interesting, thrilling, suspenseful, and cleverly written novel that has a really engaging storyline and solid characters that grabbed my attention from the very first chapter.MARY KUBICA delivers an impressive read here told in the alternating perspectives of Clara\u2019s investigation into the death of her husband, Nick and in Nick\u2019s voice of his last months leading up to his accident. \u00a0The only thing that I found a little distracting was that there were no chapters separating Clara\u2019s and Nick\u2019s stories. \u00a0They just ran into each other and I found that I had to go back and re-read to see if I was reading Clara\u2019s perspective or Nick\u2019s. \u00a0Once I realized that there were no tell-tale signs to differentiate the two then I found it a little easier to follow along with the storyline and all the characters involved. (I am sure this was just a NetGalley formatting issue though and won't be like this on the actual print copy when released.) Update: Netgalley sent me an updated version of this book with Clara & Nick's perspectives clearing marked.I found it a really interesting read that explores how when are minds are so tormented with grief it can really mess with our psyche and how we ultimately perceive things as being the truth or fiction. \u00a0I could really relate to how Clara reacted to her overwhelming grief as she presented with quite a few things that I know that I would and could have done. \u00a0Can\u2019t sleep, can\u2019t eat, can\u2019t think straight, can\u2019t function normally, overactive imagination, and obsessive behaviour to name a few.To sum it all up it was an entertaining, fast-paced, and an easy read with an unexpected but satisfying ending.

It explores the state of a marriage and asks whether it is really possible to know your partner. The story is narrated through the perspectives of Clara Solberg and her husband, Nick. A shattered Clara has recently given birth to son, Felix, and is looking after him when the police knock on the door. Nick has been killed after he crashed into a tree on his return journey from collecting 4 year old daughter, Maisie, from ballet class. The police have ruled it an accident.An overwhelmed Clara is suffering from shock, grief and finding it hard to come to terms with her new status of widow and single mother of two young children. Her father is struggling to cope with caring for her mother, who is caught in the grips of dementia. Her suspicions arise when Maisie begins to suffer from terrible nightmares where she talks of a bad man and a black car. The police dismiss her concerns of there being more to Nick's death. However, an obsessed Clara cannot let it go as she starts investigating in her search for the truth and whether Nick was murdered. In this twisted story, it soon becomes clear that Nick's life harboured secrets and lies. The novel starts with a slow pace but later shifts dramatically as the story becomes considerably more fast paced. There is plenty of suspense, tension and twists. It is beautifully written and well plotted. I really liked the characters of Clara and Nick, a man of good intentions and coming clean but never quite gets there. An enjoyable and entertaining read.

It gave insight into what was happening with Nick.When Clara learns that her husband had been keeping secrets from her, she starts to doubt everything about her marriage. What else doesn't she know? Is it possible Clara never knew her husband at all?I have to say that Mary Kubica sure knows how to set a scene. She's good at showing what grief, stress, and exhaustion etc. can do to a person. I could almost feel the anxiety and stress Clara was experiencing. When she described how hot it was, I felt like I was starting to sweat and actually turned up my a/c. At the same time, there were a few things that bothered me. I don't want to get into spoiler territory but some of the decisions Clara made as a mother had me baffled. There were contradictions and some of her actions distracted me from the story. I was slightly let down by the ending and felt like a few things were unresolved.However, there are many different opinions about this book, and some of the things that irked me may not bother other readers. Although I was hoping for more, EVERY LAST LIE was still an enjoyable read and I look forward to more from Mary Kubica.Thank you, Netgalley and Harlequin for an advanced readers copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Bookphile", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4792318-bookphile", "userReview": "A *complete* miss for me. I figured out several key twists long before they were revealed, and I pretty much hated Clara. Complete review to come.Full review:Every Last Lie is a book that seems to be suffering from a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, the books hints at dark secrets, but on the other, it doesn't want those secrets to be *too* dark, lest the characters become unlikable. It probably goes without saying is that the end result is the book falls flat, and at times it even delves into ridiculous territory. There will be a fair amount of spoilers in this review, so read at your own risk.I'll say right off that my biggest issue with this book is the characters, particularly Clara and Nick. I couldn't stand either of them, which isn't the determining factor in whether I like a book, but I could almost sense the author straining for me to like them. As a couple, they're nauseating. Every time Nick waxed poetic about his wife it came across as cheesy rather than endearing. And Clara has such a huge blind spot when it comes to her husband that it's a wonder she can see anything at all. On their own, they're no better.Let's start with Clara. The book wants me to sympathize with her as a grieving widow, and while that coupled with the possibility of her having some form of postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis did allow the book to stretch its credibility, it's way too over the top in the end. I could understand Clara latching on to the idea of Nick's death not being an accident, particularly given Maisie's actions. However, Clara becomes unhinged, in a way that would have worked if this book wanted to go all the way to the dark side. This book doesn't want to go there, though, and so even though Clara repeatedly neglects her children to the point of abuse, acts out in ways that should have made the people around her feel a lot more alarmed for her state of mind, and eventually resorts to violence, I felt I was supposed to sympathize with her. The worst, most egregious example of this is when she loses all control with Izzy, her mother's caretaker. *Of course* Izzy turns out to be a thief, because otherwise the reader might be appalled by the fact that Clara brutally beats her. I also found it just ludicrous that Clara gets self-righteous about what her children shouldn't be exposed to, but ultimately stops beating Izzy only because Maisie sees her doing it. Oh, I'm sure *that* won't cause the poor kid any lasting trauma. I also rolled my eyes so hard at the detective who doesn't even do so much as call social services when an unwashed, unhinged new mother covered in blood (blood she outright says isn't her own) shows up at the police station with her two kids in tow--even though he suspects she assaulted Izzy. How does this woman not end up arrested?Nick isn't much better. Clara's father issued all kinds of warnings about him, and it turns out he was right. There are varying degrees to Nick's sins, but since there's a whole laundry list of them, I ended up outright hating his character. There are his sins of omission, which range from mild (not telling his wife about an ex-girlfriend making a reappearance in his life) to outrageously awful (not telling his wife about said ex's suspicions about her son's parentage, not telling his wife about the malpractice suit being brought against him, not telling his wife about losing their entire savings, not telling his wife about... Yeah, seriously. I haven't even listed all the things he neglects to tell his wife about.) Clara's dad is straight up right about Nick being bad news, there's no doubt about that. The worst part is, after all the terrible things he does, the author pretty much gives him an out by making him win big after betting on a sporting event (because, ya know, what spouse *doesn't* want their spouse exposing them to potential further financial disaster by engaging in sports betting), thus recovering the entire savings he lost. Yep. I'm not making that up, sadly.The mystery, such as it is, isn't a mystery at all. Oh, there are so many red herrings all over the place you'll think you're out to sea, but that does not a plot make. I think there's an argument to be made that this is more psychological suspense in that it deconstructs how a wife deals with grief rather than it being psychological suspense of a criminal nature, but that's not what this book is promising. Instead, I slogged my way through hundreds of pages of poorly developed secondary characters who exist only to move the plot along (Hello, neighbor who abuses his wife. How you doing, skeezy best friend who only seems like he's going to be helpful to his best friend's grieving widow.), overwrought passages about dealing with grief, nauseating depictions of a husband star-struck by his wife, and a protagonist who's so dense and so off her rocker that it's hard to read for all the eye-rolling her actions induce. I recommend skipping straight over this one."}, {"userName": "Hannah Greendale", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale", "userReview": "Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.Clara Solberg\u2019s world is torn asunder when her husband Nick and four-year-old daughter Maisie are in a car crash from which Maisie walks away unharmed and Nick is injured fatally. Police deem the crash an accident, but when Maisie starts having night terrors and crying about what she saw just before the crash, Clara has reason to believe that her husband\u2019s death was not an accident. In no uncertain terms, I\u2019m told that this is Nick\u2019s fault. Nick is to blame for his own death. He is the reason why I\u2019ve been left alone with two young kids, a fragmented car and hospital bills. As it turns out, it\u2019s quite expensive to die. Every Last Lie immediately opens with a tragic and gripping setup: Clara just lost the man she loves, is recovering from recently giving birth, now has two small children to raise on her own, has been told by the police that her husband is to blame for her traumatic circumstances; and, before the first chapter concludes, an eerie incident gives readers their first inkling that the crash may not have been an accident. Clara is emotional distraught as she begins to dig for the truth; her mistrust and uncertainty is largely the source of the book\u2019s suspense. Her story is thrilling because questions arise through Kubica\u2019s deft manipulation of Clara\u2019s thought process. She\u2019s a sleep deprived woman grappling with grief and uncertainty, and readers get swept down a vortex of spiraling speculation right alongside her.With sharp writing and clever twists, Every Last Lie succeeds at being a psychologically suspenseful read. -Special thanks to Harlequin Books for sending me a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "Nothing worked; her mind continues to fade.Clara Solberg is experiencing the deep dimension of an unspeakable collision. Her husband, Nick, crashed into a tree with their four year old daughter, Maisie, in the car. He had taken her to ballet class and had picked up Chinese takeout on his way home so that Clara could stay home with their newborn son.But this horrendous collision is now within Clara herself. It's the collision of reality obliterating any sense of the normal life she and her children once had. Shock does terrible things to one's psyche. It has left Clara reeling in its aftermath. Fortunately, little Maisie was unhurt. Unfortunately, Nick did not survive. But Maisie is now locked into the grasp of reoccurring nightmares involving a black car and a \"bad man\". Soon Clara suspects that perhaps Nick's fatal accident was no accident after all. She alerts the police, but they dismiss the black car as the ramblings of a four year old.With the support of her father, Clara tries to carry on. Boppy, as Maisie likes to call him, is strained from the care of Clara's mother who suffers from dementia. Clara sees what the weight of this care is doing to him. They both are wounded deeply in different ways and down different avenues. So Clara decides to do some investigative work on her own in regard to this black car. Now here's where the story elevates to the next tier. Nick's life seems to have taken a turn down some very treacherous roads. Mary Kubica brings to life the nagging fear of lifting the veil on the hidden corners of a loved one's life. Can one handle that shocking reveal? And then what......Kubica presents a storyline pumped up with the frenzy of taking on the odds of the impossible. Can anyone really trace the finite details that led to this death? She creates the character of Clara who emulates a woman raging inside from recent death and recent birth. Clara takes this on with the impetus of both wife and mother. Love is the springboard that makes all things possible.Mary Kubica, you have a real winner here. You painted this canvas with life-like characters in life-like situations. It's a bit of a view into what drives and what motivates us to survive in such an uncertain world that can suffocate the best of us at times.

My problem is that Clare's character irritated the heck out of me. I understand her grasping at straws, following lead after non lead, but the author let this go on far to long, imo. I actually felt more and understood Nick's story and his grasping at straws, his desperation, far more easily. Clare's mothering skills also left much to be desired. So a mixed read for me, suspenseful yes, but maybe a tad overwritten.

So many lies. I am a huge fan of Mary Kubica's writing. It is a slow burn and the suspense creeps up on you with time. While this particular story was a bit slower than my liking, it really picked up about half way through and left me breathless and needing to know which lie precipitated this awful tragedy. And yet, I felt totally let down by the conclusion. There was so much buildup and then it flatlined for me to the point where I feel like I am missing something, some hidden message that my brain didn't grasp. These characters definitely ran me through a gamut of emotions - fear, pity, sympathy, disbelief, frustration, and on and on. I loved the dual narrative of Clara (present) and Nick (near past). It really helped to build up the tension and backstory and gave a real sense of suspense. I have to say it would be no easy feat to create a storyline in this fashion, and it's very well done.

Clara begins to doubt the wreck was simply an accident when Maisie starts having nightmares about a \"bad man\" being after them. As she digs for clues, Clara finds that Nick was hiding some unsettling secrets, but were they enough to get him killed?The story is told in alternating perspectives - Nick, in the weeks leading up to the crash, and Clara, in the weeks after Nick's death. I liked that readers got to hear both POVs, which added to the suspense of what Nick might reveal and what Clara might discover. Not only is Clara dealing with her husband's suspicious death, she's also now the sole caregiver of Maisie and newborn Felix. So many anxiety-inducing elements in this story! Clara made some very questionable choices throughout, and I'm sure teetering on the edge of sanity didn't help.I guess I have two niggling complaints with the book. First, there were some loose ends and questions that I wanted answers to, and secondly, I wasn't thrilled with the ending. I read another mystery that had a similar ending, and while it worked there, it didn't so much with EVERY LITTLE LIE. Nevertheless, I still think this was an intriguing and well-written book, as much a character study in grief as a novel of suspense.Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "I was really glad to leave Clara Solberg behind me.

The narration alternates between Clare in the present tense and Nick relating the weeks leading up to his death including all the events he kept secret from Clare and this works well. I was disappointed in the ending as I expected an interesting twist or revelation so the ending we got fell a bit flat after the build up to it.

DNF at 86 pages. Book starts off with cops telling Clara, who has just given birth to a son four days ago, that her husband, Nick, has died in a car accident. The grief was palpable and I initially thought, \u201cI don't need this right now.\u201d As I read further, I realized a postpartum, sleep deprived, and grieving main character does not appeal to me. Neither do the many tantrums from the four year old daughter. The dentist husband\u2019s chapters were sort of more interesting until money problems/old friend/new dentist in town/patient from hell showed up. So the book may or may not be at fault, but I know my head is the main problem."}, {"userName": "Linda Strong", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13684015-linda-strong", "userReview": "Clara Solberg has a perfect life .... at least up until the day her husband, Nick, and her daughter, Maisie are in a car crash. Nick is killed, Maisie, fortunately, got nothing but a scratch.The accident is ruled an accident ... Nick had been speeding and apparently lost control and rammed into a tree. However, Maisie is having night terrors, leaving Clara to think that maybe her husband was murdered.Clara has to find out the truth. She can't sleep, she doesn't eat. She hasn't even told Maisie yet that her daddy is gone. Her grief is overwhelming and she's obsessed with the idea that her beloved husband was murdered.Her pursuit of truth leads her to secrets that her husband kept from her. She didn't know how much in debt they were. She doesn't know that he had begun gambling. She doesn't know that Nick fired his best friend? What else is there that she doesn't know?The story is told in part by Clara, the here and now. Nick's story is told in his voice in the months leading up to his death. This is another highly suspenseful story by this author. The story premise is cleverly written and the characters are solid. The ending was quite different from what I thought it would be.The only thing I really didn't like is that there seems to be no separation (as in chapters) between Clara's story and Nick's remembrances. They ran into each other. I would be reading Clara and then all of a sudden it would hit me that I was reading Nick. Just a tad disorienting.Many thanks to the author / Harlequin (US & Canada) / Park Row Books / Netgalley for the advanced copy of EVERY LAST LIE.

My Nick? It can't be.Nick wouldn't hurt a fly or tell a lie... EVER.Did Clara really know her Nick?Nick's life kept spinning and spiraling out of control as debts mounted and his savings was depleted, and then the unthinkable happened.Clara couldn't believe her husband was talking on the phone while driving, driving too fast around a curve when he had their daughter in the car, and having an affair.When the police came to Clara's door and said there had been an accident, Clara didn't want to believe it was Nick until she saw him lifeless on the table in the emergency room . The only saving grace was that Maisie miraculously hadn't been harmed.As the days after Nick's death turned into weeks and Clara still hadn't told her daughter her father had died, Maisie began to scream about a bad man and continually asked when her daddy would be home. This made a sleep-deprived and grieving Clara believe someone had killed Nick and that it wasn\u2019t his speeding that had killed him.EVERY LAST LIE begins with a car crash that turned Clara's life upside down for more than one reason and turns worse every day as things about her husband are revealed. Nick lied about their finances and who knows what else. Clara just couldn't believe it.Clara was an annoying character for me because she had no clue about what was going on in her household, and her parenting skills were awful. She left children in a running car and didn't know how to handle crying children. She didn't even know how to take care of herself.Nick seemed to be a good father and husband on the surface but a sleaze bag in every other way.There actually were not too many trustworthy characters in this book, but oh did they all make EVERY LAST LIE an excellent read.Ms. Kubica cleverly moves from past to present with chapters headed CLARA and chapters headed NICK - BEFORE And AFTER as she takes us on a secret-revealing ride with the secrets having been better left unknown.This was my first book by Mary Kubica, and it grabbed me the minute I read the suspenseful, attention-grabbing opening lines.EVERY LAST LIE is a book every reader of psychological thrillers won't want to miss.

(This is not a spoiler, it's how the book opens.) Their daughter Maisie has nightmares and terrors that leads Clara to suspect Nick's death was not an accident.Told in alternating chapters with the POV of both Clara and Nick (before the accident) the pieces of the puzzle that led up to the accident are revealed. Clara's suspicions leads her to conduct an investigation of sorts, all while she's navigating new parenthood, financial problems, grief, and her mother's worsening dementia. Clara is overwhelmed with grief and obsessed with finding the truth, and finds plausible reasons and evidence for a number of different scenarios. There's a feverish quality to her narrative and I felt her pain, confusion, and grief. Painful secrets her husband kept from her are uncovered and she begins to suspect different people with each revelation. The characters, including Nick, aren't always the most likable people.I found this a credible narrative of grief, as well as those crazed sleepless first days/weeks with a newborn and the exhaustion that comes with it. The suspense was more of a slow burn since Nick was already dead, but along with Clara I wasn't sure who or what was responsible for the accident and was invested in discovering the truth.

It's ridiculous and pointless, I know, but it helps me somehow with the stress and inconvenience of it all. So I understood completely when Every Last Lie's unfortunate new widow needed an explanation for every single infraction that surfaced after the death of her husband. There are small lies, blatant omissions of truth, and substantial what the f*ck's. \n\n\u201cNo secrets, he always said. None. But now I'm beginning to believe there were secrets indeed. Many secrets. Had he been lying to me for the last eight weeks, the last two months, or for many years? \u2026 What else don't I know?\u201d\n\n Mary Kubica allows alternating perspectives and timeframes to tell this story. Clara, the widow, starts readers off beginning the day she learns of her husband's death via car crash and continues as she sifts through the mystery that has become his life. Their four-year-old daughter, who was in the vehicle at the time of the crash, provides clues along the way, creating an even more disjointed but intriguing trail to follow. Within his individual perspective, Nick, the husband shares all his secrets beginning months prior and ending right up to the crash. This creates tons of suspicion and that thriller element that makes this genre so fun to read.As with most books in this genre, there are a lot of questions and not a lot of answers which spikes the suspense and allows readers to entertain themselves by drawing several premature conclusions. The characters are developed well which allows strong issues to shine, such as motherhood, grief, aging parents, and fighting battles alone. Based on my personal reading experience though, Clara's POV felt repetitive and slow as she spins round and round in a never ending circle of confusion. I much preferred Nick's POV as it allowed the mystery to take on a more visible shape, enabling the reader to start their own guessing game as to what happened and who was involved. In the end, I had predicted the outcome several times and was personally disappointed that I was right. However, Ms. Kubica wrote a twist I have never read before so well done! in that regard. Overall, the combination of slow pacing and a build-up that (in my opinion) overshadows the conclusion ended up creating a reading experience that I don't feel enthusiastic about. However, if you have historically enjoyed Mary Kubica's work, check out this title for yourself and see what you think!My favorite quote:\u201cOh, how easy it is to judge when we don't know.\u201dThank you to the following for permitting me access to an advance reader's copy (ARC) of Every Last Lie.

As Clara tries her best to soothe her daughter, she begins to wonder if it really was an accident that killed her husband and if not, who could be possibly want her husband dead? Another spot-on, suspense-fueled, gripping psychological thriller from the wonderful Mary Kubica, \u201cEvery Last Lie\u201d is fast-paced and filled with drama and intrigue. Each page-turning chapter is as addictive as the one before it, making this book impossible to put down. A huge fan of Kubica, this novel kept up the pace of her other works. Written creatively, with well-thought-out storylines and developed characters, Kubica draws a reader in from the start. Clara is honest and real, and a reader is easily able to connect with her and sympathize with her as she struggles with her grief and possible deception from the one man she loved most. There are several possible ways this novel could have turned out, many twists and turns that could\u2019ve resulted in any one of the many people being the \u201ckiller\u201d of Nick. Each time I hazard a guess, Kubica would throw in another surprise and get me off my trail. When the ending finally came around (nice and succinctly, as with her other novels), it was extremely satisfying and comforting- wrapping up a great novel in the perfect way. High-fives all around for Kubica. Her latest work, \u201cEvery Last Lie\u201d is gripping, stunning and absolutely un-put-down-able. Highly recommended, Ms. Kubica is certainly one to watch in the psychological thriller genre.

Nick is driving his little girl home from ballet class when a terrible accident takes his life.....and miraculously spares his four-year-old daughter Maisie. Nick's wife Clara - who's home nursing their 4-day-old infant Felix when the tragedy occurs - is shocked and disoriented by the loss. One minute she's married to a successful dentist, and the next she's a 28-year-old widow with two small children. Clara has other problems as well. Her mother is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and her father - who cares for his wife with the help of an aide - can barely cope.The police investigate the crash and conclude that Nick's reckless driving caused the accident. Clara refuses to accept this; she doesn't think Nick would put his child at risk. Clara's beliefs are reinforced when Maisie says 'a bad man' was following the car.....and freaks out at the sight of a black automobile. Clara concludes that someone in a black car forced Nick off the road - in other words, murdered him! Clara does some investigating of her own, and talks to people who live near the accident site. She brings her 'evidence' to the police, who say they'll look into 'the black car' murder theory. However, the cops are clearly skeptical.Meanwhile, Clara - a photographer with little income at the moment - knows she has to pull things together. She needs to collect Nick's life insurance to pay for hefty funeral expenses and household bills; and she has to sell Nick's dental practice. When Clara looks into doing these things, however, she discovers that Nick was keeping BIG secrets from her!The story is told in the alternating voices of Nick and Clara. Nick relates his experiences before the accident; and Clara talks about what happens right before and then after the crash.In Nick's narrative we learn that he had a big fight with his bullying neighbor across the street; he pulled the tooth of a patient from hell, with dire consequences; he fell out with his 'partner' in the dental practice; he gambled with the family's funds; he became reacquainted with his (now married) former girlfriend, whose son might be his; and so on. Nick was becoming undone by these problems - but felt he couldn't tell Clara because she was pregnant. In Clara's chapters, we see her find out about Nick's secrets.....one by one. Clara discovers that the dental practice is in disarray and that Nick's life insurance policy was cancelled. Clara also sees a receipt for a pricey necklace among Nick's things and learns that a woman had a restraining order against him. These discoveries - and other 'clues' - lead Clara to speculate that Nick was having an affair; that he was a drug dealer; that he was planning to leave her; etc. Clara adds to her own troubles by refusing to tell Maisie that her father is dead. Maisie's continual request 'to see daddy' is met with lies and misdirection.On top of all that, Clara's parents are in crisis. Her mother no longer recognizes her; acts out when Clara's visits; and - when no one is looking - swipes the car keys and goes for rides. For his part, Clara's father seems to be having problems with his memory and is apparently mishandling the family's finances. As Clara tries to identify Nick's killer; take care of her money woes; figure out who Nick really is; and take care of a toddler and an infant - she starts to break down. She can't sleep, can't eat, and edges toward becoming delusional - unable to separate speculation from fact. Moreover, Clara's paranoia is exacerbated by a real life 'stalker.'The story is engaging and kept my attention, but at some point - around the middle of the book - the characters' woes started to strain credulity. For instance, Nick's problems became so immense that I no longer believed he could keep them from his wife. A man with so much on his mind couldn't act act completely normal at home. Surely Clara would suss something out!As for Clara, she seemed to lose all her common sense and - at one point - behaved like a psychopath.....with her children right there. I found this behavior to be unbelievable. Even with these problems, though, the story is a compelling thriller with surprises I never saw coming. The book doesn't require much deep thinking and would be a good choice for vacation entertainment (IMO).You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."}, {"userName": "Amanda - Mrs B's Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16323644-amanda---mrs-b-s-book-reviews", "userReview": "*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.com*4.5 starsSince the release of the blockbuster debut novel The Good Girl, Mary Kubica has carved out a successful career in the suspense and psychological thriller field. Every Last Lie is Mary Kubica\u2019s latest explosive read. It focuses on the fallout from a tragic accident that claims the life of Nick Solberg, a young dentist, a loving husband and a doting father of two children. Every Last Lie is a compelling read that outlines one young widow\u2019s determination to never give up and find out the root cause to her husband\u2019s shock passing.Clara Solberg is a mum of two, who gave birth to her son Felix only a matter of days before her husband and daughter have a horrific car crash. This car crash is fatal, leaving Nick brain dead and soon after the accident, he passes away. Maisie, the couple\u2019s daughter, miraculously survives the crash relatively unscathed. The official police ruling on the car crash deems it as an accident, Nick\u2019s death is blamed on reckless driving. In the days that follow, Clara cannot shake the feeling that Nick would not drive so carelessly with their daughter Maisie in the car. Coupled with Maisie\u2019s nightmares since the accident, Clara is beginning to wonder if her husband\u2019s death was simply an accident or it was deliberate. Clara cannot push this gut feeling pertaining to Nick\u2019s cause of death aside and resolves to do all she can to get to the truth. It is a desperate hunt for answers that is plagued by Clara\u2019s personal struggles with being thrust into single parenthood, fighting insomnia, worrying about the care of her mother with dementia and dealing with the family business finances. In the months leading up to Nick\u2019s death, Clara discovers a trail of deceit that makes her question if she really knew the real Nick.Mary Kubica has made a name for herself in recent years, delivering one successful psychological thriller release after another. Every Last Lie is her latest intoxicating thriller that follows a sleep deprived widow\u2019s attempts to hunt down the final cause for her husband\u2019s untimely death. This quest takes widow Clara to the dark recesses of the mind, questioning all that she holds dear.Kubica is a clever novelist, who is able to twist the reader around her finger, by hooking the audience in from the starting line of her latest novel. I was instantly sucked into Every Last Lie and this fixation with the story at hand didn\u2019t let go until the final page was turned. For me, I firmly believe it indicates Kubica\u2019s skill as an accomplished writer in the thriller genre.Kubica\u2019s mode of storytelling is absorbing. In Every Last Lie, the narrative is told via a rotation style format. The reader is kept up to date with events in the present time, told by Clara, now a widow. The other point of view is husband Nick\u2019s perspective, which covers the developments in the past, focussing on the months leading up to Nick\u2019s accident. This is an ingenious form of narrative building, as the suspense is delivered at a steady rate, evenly feeding the reader clues as to the central mystery.Kubica applies a strong sense of realism to her characters. Clara was a character that I was very quickly able to relate to. I have experienced the pangs of new motherhood and the lack of sleep that goes hand in hand with a newborn. Coupling this with the care of older children and the household in general is hard indeed. What broke my heart was how this poor young woman, recovering from childbirth and dealing with a newborn, was thrust into widowhood through such a tragic occurrence. It made me shudder at the very thought of how I would have coped in such a scenario. It was simply unfathomable! Clara seems to have too much to contend with in Every Last Lie, from becoming an unexpected widow, dealing with a newborn, coping with a preschooler experiencing night tremors and the added pressure of her mother\u2019s dementia. I was surprised Clara didn\u2019t suffer a full breakdown! With so much on her plate, the reader is left in doubt as to Clara\u2019s credibility and ability to deal with the truth. Either way, Clara earned both my pity and my deepest sympathy. Nick is also a character dusted with a strong coating of realism. With half of the narrative told from his viewpoint, it is easy to develop an attachment to Nick and understand how complicated his life became in the time leading up to his death. The secondary cast, such as Clara parents, neighbours, the law enforcement, Nick\u2019s colleagues and patients from his dental practice, Kubica ensures that each character has a duty in the novel. This gives room for suspicion, doubt and possible involvement in Nick\u2019s death to arise from these characters. Kubica largely keeps the reader on their toes, providing many moments of misdirection in the novel, in order manipulate the final outcome of this novel. It was a final outcome which I didn\u2019t see coming.Every Last Lie is a stirring read that made my heart break, while simultaneously keeping my mind boggling, as widow Clara unravelled the layers to expose the truth of her husband\u2019s death. Kubica is dexterous writer, flashing her skills in the thriller genre, to drop a tale into her reader\u2019s hands that meshes the past and the present in one spectacular fallout. I enjoyed the white knuckled ride immensely.*I wish to thank Harlequin Books Australia for providing me with a free copy of this book for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Poppy fairy ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18322003-poppy-fairy", "userReview": "My review can be found on www.ireadnovels.wordpress.com and Twitter@favouritenovelsIn my view Every Last Lie has been my favourite book by the author Mary Kubica. I found that the characters were more believable, as in real-life people often die close to each other, I had two Nan's that died twenty-two days with in each other, just like in this novel. I related to Clara Solberg giving birth with taking the baby home, getting no sleep, making your eyes feel heavy, as I had the same problem getting no sleep with my daughter when she was a baby. \u00a0I thought that the theme of the story was showing just how exactly one moment a life can be full of roses being a mother and a wife, with the next it can be filled grief. \u00a0Clara Solberg's life is shattered by grief when her husband dies in a car crash. There is even more torment for Clara when her four-year-old daughter tells her mum that a bad man is after them. Was Clara's husband car accident an accident at all? \u00a0How well does Clara know her husband and has Nick been keeping secrets from her?Although this story wasn't based on a real place I could picture the where the car crash scene took place. There is a great twist in this page - turning suspense that I didn't see coming. I do think that when a family member dies that it is the most hardest thing to explain death to a young four-year-old. I personally haven't read a book like Every Last Lie so I can't compare it to any other book for you readers. Every last lie would make an excellent book for a reading group to discuss as there are a lot of points about speeding in a car to do you tell the truth when a family member dies or do you keep it a secret from a child. \u00a0I was sent this book by HQ for an honest review and for that I am every so grateful as I enjoyed every page."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin", "userReview": "Mary Kubica is back! Over the past few years Mary Kubica has become one of my favorite authors. I devoured her first two books The Good Girl and Pretty Baby but I wasn't a big fan of Don't You Cry. So I didn't know what to expect from Every Last Lie, I was excited to read it but also a little worried that I'd be disappointed. So I put off reading it for a few weeks and then I fell into a reading slump(I blame The Seven Husband's of Evelyn Hugo, damn that was a great book) I needed something to pull me out of it so... I picked up Every Last Lie and hoped for the best and...Mary, you saved me. Just like her first two books I could not put this book down. I needed to know what happened to Nick. I read some reviews for this book and they said it was a slow burn or that nothing happens but I disagree. I thought it was evenly plotted and not slow at all. I did prefer the Nick chapters. Clara was just too over the top and stressful. I strongly recommend Every Last Lie to readers who like tension filled thrillers that will have you on the edge of your seat."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "Clara Solberg's life gets turned upside down when her husband and their four year old daughter, Maisie are in a car crash. Her husband, Nick, had taken Maisie to her ballet practice, picked up Chinese food and was on his way home when his car hit a tree, killing Nick but leaving Maisie unharmed.Clara is not willing to believe that her husband's death is accidental. Her daughter is having nightmares about a bad man being after them. A bad man who may have been following then that tragic night. Clara, who has recently given birth to the couple's second child is sleep deprived and full of grief. She is fueled by the need to know the circumstances surrounding her husband's death.This book is told through both Nick and Clara's point of view/perspectives. Through Clara's POV the reader gets a glimpse on how she is coping with her husband's death and the \"truths\" she uncovers surrounding her husband, his dental practice, their finances and his relationships with others. Through Nick's perspective, we see a man hiding secrets from his wife. He's not a bad guy. He is a man who wants to protect his wife from feeling stress while she is pregnant, so he is not forthcoming with the truth. Nick plans to come clean - to tell her everything. He just never seems to find the time to sit her her down and tell her everything. He also makes decisions without his wife's knowledge. What will happen when she finds out the truth? How will he dig himself out of the hole he has dug? What happens when your good intentions spiral out of control?What really worked for me was the alternating perspectives of Nick and Clara. This book was a fast easy read which kept my attention the entire time. Kubica kept the plot, secrets and revelations coming at a very good pace. I had to keep reading to find out what lies and what truths would be revealed. As the story progresses, the book turns into a page turner as the truth finally comes out. Clara and the reader eventually learn the truth about Nick's accident.This is a good book for those who enjoy a good mystery/thriller without an graphic scenes/language/gore, etc. I received a copy of this book from Harlequin/Park Row books and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Laura Rash", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34779639-laura-rash", "userReview": "Once again Mary Kubica has written a story that draws you in from the first chapter & doesn't let go until the last. I described her books today to a friend as being similar to \"comfort food\". You can slip into the story & lose yourself & feel like you know the characters & have been there for awhile. Loved the alternating character POV. Perfect ending. I won this copy on Goodreads:)"}, {"userName": "Rachel Hall", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28372189-rachel-hall", "userReview": "After her stunningly debut, The Good Girl, I have continued to be impressed by Mary Kubica\u2019s above average storytelling and consistent psychological thrillers, often played out from alternating perspectives. The premise of Every Last Lie poses the perennial question that much of the genre is fascinated by; namely, how much a person ever really trust their spouse? Despite this familiar starting point, Kubica always offers something more original and throws in questions about reliability of the narration, with widow, Clara, having given birth in the days preceding the nightmare implosion of her world and her deceased husband, Nick, in the throes of a breakdown prior to his demise. It is this exploration of the maelstrom of subconscious emotions and self-perpetuating paranoia that brings a darker, unsettling chill to this novel.Every Last Lies opens with Clara Solberg awaiting the return of husband, Nick and four-year-old daughter, Maisie, from ballet class, hopefully bringing a takeaway home for dinner as newborn, Felix, sleeps. As time ticks by, the patrol car and cop that arrives at her door brings the devastating news that Nick lies brain dead in hospital after a head-on collision into a tree caused by a combination of taking a narrow hairpin bend too fast and a blinding summer sunset. Disbelief sets in for Clara, leaving her refusing to believe what she is told. In the midst of such discombobulation she swings from anger that Nick could have taken such a risk with their daughter in the back seat to needing someone to blame. To Clara, is just doesn\u2019t stack up, and she sidesteps breaking the news of Nick\u2019s death to Maisie, particularly given her night terrors and frequent mentions of a \u201cbad man\u201d. A grief stricken Clara latches onto these half formed words of Maisie\u2019s to convince herself that Nick was the victim of a homicide, being forced off the road by a \u201cbad man\u201d chasing them down in a black car. Despite police finding no evidence of anything other than an unfortunate accident, Clara visits the scene of the accident and then stumbles upon a series of discoveries which support the distressing theory that Nick didn\u2019t share every part of his life with her. Seeking closure, she continues to probe further into Nick\u2019s personal affairs, and Kubica flags up, albeit a little heavy-handedly, a whole host of possible suspects, from family members to neighbours and friends. Despite my early scepticism, Kubica turns the novel on its head to deliver a solid mystery element to the novel.The story unfolds through the perspectives of Nick, in the months and days leading up to the incident and Clara\u2019s tumultuous emotions and tenuous grasp of the facts following the fatality. Despite the novel opening as a fairly lucklustre pace on the basis of a terrified Maisie, Clara\u2019s gradual discoveries and continued denial gathers pace and with Nick detailing his own crumbling business as the story builds, the suspense is limited. However, at about the halfway point when Nick\u2019s woes begin to compound and his mental state becomes more fragile, the suspense goes into overdrive and I was fascinated by the dubious judgment calls he made, all heightened by his bewilderment and last ditch attempts to save his family as he clings to the edge of sanity. The initial stages of this novel were subject to some minor overlap in the two narratives, however I never found it onerous, rather it just meant that it took a little longer for the story to take hold and begin to fire my imagination. Admittedly, Clara is difficult to get a read on. Clearly her behaviour is affected by her grief and the additional hormonal strains in the days following labour. However as she increasingly loses her grasp on reality, exacerbating Maisie\u2019s all consuming fears and making questionable decisions, particularly as regards childcare, her meltdown is wholly believable. Whilst I was irritated and frustrated by her behaviour, I cannot deny that Kubica has undoubtedly done a fine job of exposing Clara\u2019s deterioration, panic attacks and paranoia. Whilst Every Last Lie presents a believable level of fear in Clara, it doesn\u2019t stop readers chomping at the bit to up the pace in the first half of the novel. There were also several questions that I would have appreciated being addressed, specifically why Clara jumped to the worst conclusion without even probing some basics, such as asking questions at the practice, presenting her early discoveries to the cops and why the detective who she harangues frequently delays advising grief counselling or the support of a mental health professional. Every Last Lie is a story that will resonate with readers, due to the well-drawn characters whose individual pressures are addressed and motives for decisions explored, whatever their state of mind. The further into Every Last Lie that the readers ventures, the more of an achievement the novel appears with Mary Kubica taking it into the darker territory of psychological thrillers. For me, Mary Kubica always proves a worthwhile read and despite a little early repetition and a tired opening, this is another novel that packs a punch.
