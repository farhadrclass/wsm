Now four years later Gemma is beginning to resent being the only bread winner in the marriage and the long hours she puts in at the office although she still loves her family.When a business trip calls Gemma away she gets a bit upset again when her husband had already put their son to bed and she missed talking to him. Frustrated to yet again miss out she heads out of her room and runs into a client who invites her to dinner. The night led to a lot of talking and quite a few drinks which left Gemma kicking herself for the hangover in the morning but when Gemma begins to receive threatening messages she begins to wonder just what happened that night she can\u2019t recall.The Girl I Used to Be by Mary Torjussen is a psychological thriller that is mostly told from Gemma\u2019s point of view in the present but it does switch the point of view and include flashes back to past events in a few places. The story is one that is super easy to follow and everything flows along nicely though.After reading Gone Without a Trace last year I knew when I saw The Girl I Used to Be I needed to pick this one up and thankfully yet again I found a book that was easy to get lost in as the story unfolded. As expected I found that just when you think you know what is going on there will be another twist and layer added in to change up the story and keep one guessing and the pages turning.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/"}, {"userName": "Mackenzie - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57632045-mackenzie---traveling-sister", "userReview": "A wonderful, psychological thriller that will make you wonder what you would do if this happened to you!!!I am a big fan of Mary Torjussen\u2019s last book Gone Without a Trace. As a psychologist, I always find books that deal with the character\u2019s mindset effectively to be so compelling, and this is an area Mary really excels in as an author. This book was one I read in two days (which, for someone who works full-time and has a dissertation to write is quite an endorsement). The steady building of suspense in this book had the reader feeling slightly off-kilter along with the protagonist\u2014and that is what made it so hard to put down! I found myself skipping my lunch break to read a bit more, and turning down plans for drinks after work because I had to know what would happen next!PlotGemma owns her own real estate business and loves her career. She has a wonderful husband and a beautiful son, but she also has some darkness in her past. Though Gemma loves her husband and they agreed for him to stay home with their young son while she builds her business, she finds herself occasionally resenting the time he gets with their son. But Gemma would never do anything to jeopardize the family she loves so much.Until one day, Gemma is out with a client for dinner, and the next thing she knows she wakes up alone in her hotel room with no memory of the night and a blistering hangover\u2026 Gemma would never cheat on her husband, but she can\u2019t seem to remember the events of the evening. Sure, she used to be a heavy drinker, but that is in her past, isn\u2019t it? As Gemma tries to shake off the sense of unease she had that fateful night, she begins getting reminders in the mail. First, she receives a receipt from that night. But why would the hotel mail her a copy of her receipt? Then, she gets a photo of her kissing someone who is not her husband in the hotel. As Gemma\u2019s world begins to unravel, and the reminders get increasingly threatening, Gemma wonders if she will ever remember what happened that night, and if she does, will it be too late to save her marriage??ReflectionGosh\u2014I loved this book! Though I loved Mary\u2019s first book, there is never a guarantee that the second one will live up to the first. In fact, often it is hard for an author to write a book that lives up to what was loved about the first book\u2014but Mary Torjussen has done it! This book was very different in terms of the plot and characters from her first book, but the writing elements I loved were still there. The slow but steady build in suspense was masterful. At the beginning, this could have just been a book about the struggles of work and marriage. And yet, there was always the sense of unease. That sense built throughout the book until the plot burst onto the page. I found myself at about 35% in shock and horror about what was happening. I couldn\u2019t imagine being in Gemma\u2019s spot! What would I do??? And the memory gap was masterful. The notion throughout the book that you can almost grasp the memory, but it escapes you\u2014that is something we can all understand, and it really added to the suspense.I loved Gemma. She was damaged yet strong. Shockingly strong, in fact. In so many of these psychological thrillers, the protagonist is such a mess, but Gemma was not that way. And for that reason, it was easy to put yourself in her place. To imagine what would happen if you were forced to keep a secret from those you love most, in part because you\u2019re not entirely sure about what the secret is!I want to thank the author Mary Torjussen for facilitating this Advanced Reader Copy for review. I also want to thank Berkley and NetGalley for allowing me to review this book honestly and fairly. I actually kept my pre-order active because I know I'll want a physical copy of the book to have for use with my reading circles!See my review here: http://novelbutnice.blogspot.com/2018..."}, {"userName": "Book of Secrets", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3453249-book-of-secrets", "userReview": "THE GIRL I USED TO BE is a fast paced psychological thriller that sucked me in right away. Most of the book is told from main character Gemma Brogan's point of view. She's a successful real estate agent with her own firm, and supporting her stay-at-home hubby, Joe, and their young son, Rory.Though Gemma loves her career, she feels stressed and stretched thin, and misses Rory during her long hours of work. Then a business trip to London goes terribly wrong, and now she's in danger of losing everything she holds dear. Someone is clearly out to get her, but why?The build up of suspense in this book was well done. In addition to her present day dilemma, Gemma is still haunted by something terrible from her past and its aftermath. Gemma's desperate situation kept me glued to the pages.

I couldn't remember, at the time, what my rating for that book was, but I do remember liking her writing style and was excited when I received the email telling me I was approved for this title.What Torjussen does well is hooking you right from the start. Immediately you're brought right into the story until you get to Part 2, where the twist comes into play. While it's not throat punchy, it definitely does get your attention. The issue for me isn't that I expected that twist, because I certainly wasn't expecting THAT to happen. Unfortunately, by the time I got there, I had lost a tiny bit of interest. I went back to my review for Gone Without A Trace and realized it was due to the same reasons. It feels a bit repetitive at times and UFF, the husband - how ANNOYING was HE?! (Great job in making me hate this guy - \ud83e\udd23.) When Part 2 comes in, then my interest gets piqued again. Where is she going to go with this? Will Gemma figure it out? Just how bad will this person go with these pictures to get to her and WHY is he doing this? All questions I need answered. We finally do get the answers ... but it's done a bit abruptly. What WAS supposed to happen at midnight? This never really got resolved. Among a few other questions I still have... There's not doubt Torjussen brings us a fun and twisted story. This story is easy to read and perfect for those who like the lighter thriller without any out of the world twists that shake you to the core. I certainly will continue to see what she brings to the table. \ud83d\ude42\u2605\u2605\u2605**edit - thank you so much to the author who clarified what happened at midnight - it makes much more sense to me now and is actually pretty obvious in the book now that i think about it - I just somehow missed it in my reading.

Imagine yourself at a bad, maybe even indelicate moment, you want nothing more than to just forget it ever happened, and just when you start to relax someone taunts you with photographic evidence of your misdeeds. It makes me uneasy just to think about something like this happening to me and that\u2019s basically the feeling I had while reading this.Torjussen\u2019s writing style has a subtle tension to it but that\u2019s combined with quick pacing and short chapters, a combination that\u2019s always appealing to me. This is the type of book that raises several questions and doesn\u2019t give any solid answers until the end, the best kind in my opinion, I love to be kept on the edge of my seat.Similar to her last book things gain traction in the last twenty five percent and I was well and truly hooked. There are some clever little plot twists throughout, nothing implausible, which is always an appreciated touch, I\u2019m sick of twists just for the sake of having one and I felt these turns added to the story in a good way.The Girl I Used to Be in three words: Clever, Chilling and Creepy."}, {"userName": "Lily (Night Owl Book Cafe)", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12907755-lily-night-owl-book-cafe", "userReview": "I received this book for free from Publisher in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.An exciting, fast-paced, page turning thriller that had me gripped until the very last page.The book mostly follows Gemma Brogan, a hard working real estate agent that is also a mom to a little boy that she hardly get's to see. Gemma has worked hard for her business and it frustrates her that her husband is refusing to look for work and is instead a stay at home dad - something she wishes she could do.One night while away on a work trip, Gemma runs into a prospective client, get's a little too drunk and wakes up regretting a nasty hangover. But now strange letters addressed to her's keep showing up, and Gemma must find out what happened that night and why it's happening.This was a really quick read, it was fast paced and it had me wanting more. I liked the characters, I could sympathize with Gemma when it came to her son, and I found myself frustrated with her husband that just did not seem to get it half the time.I thought the story and the mystery was kind of exciting and the author's writing was great. There was never really a dull moment. Thought a bit predictable in a sense, I did not find that it took away from the thrill of the story. There is an opening to the story that has you wondering how this ties into present day, so I found myself trying to put the pieces together through the book.There seemed to have been a bit of overlooked or abandoned plot that happens with Gemma a couple of weeks after the trip that led me astray or the author decided not to go that route. Hard to explain it without giving much of it away, but if you read it and know what I am talking about, let me know if you felt the same. I got an opportunity to speak to the author about this and she clarified the plot for me, so I got to understand \u00a0what the author was thinking when she wrote this part and it wasn't the direction that I thought it was going so, thank you Mary.Overall, I think so far this is definitely the best thriller I read this year and it hit checks for me as far as what I enjoy in thrillers and I do recommend this.This review was originally posted on Night Owl Book Cafe"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40994055-christine", "userReview": "The Girl I Used to Be was a solid 4. I felt very tense while I read this book wondering what would happen next. The main character, Gemma Brogan, was a likable character; although I haven\u2019t been in her situations I could empathize with her fully and wanted the messages and packages to STOP!Gemma Brogan owns her own real estate company while her husband stays home to care for their three year old son, Rory. This worked out perfectly in the beginning but now poor Gemma is working 7 days a week and is missing her son grow up and is starting to feel stressed and a bit resentful of her husband being the favored parent. Gemma goes to a real estate conference and stays the night before so she won\u2019t have to rush in the morning. She is looking forward to a stress free night alone in her hotel room, until she runs into a potential client she met a few weeks prior. David is charming, easy to talk to, a potential big sale and is also saving Gemma from talking to a colleague she would rather ignore. Gemma tells one little lie to her husband, she decides to stick with the story of the quiet evening she initially planned for herself- an early night with room service and not have to explain the change of plans, a night of dinner and too many drinks with a handsome, charming, SINGLE man. I mean, really, this dinner isn\u2019t about sexy David; it\u2019s about wooing a potential buyer leading to a large home sale. Gemma REALLY needs the income as the sole breadwinner; this sale could take some of the stress off and let her spend more time with her son. Unfortunately, the only thing Gemma\u2019s night bought her was a dreadful hangover the following morning and not remembering much of the night before but the hangover is nothing in comparison to the nightmare she can\u2019t seem to get away from. I really enjoyed this book from start to finish, and will be keeping an eye out for future reads from Mary Torjussen and going back to read her debut novel, Gone Without a Trace.*** Thank you First to Read for providing me an ARC of The Girl I Used to Be by Mary Torjussen in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Jill Croce-McGill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9119740-jill-croce-mcgill", "userReview": "THE GIRL I USED TO BE by MARY TORJUSSEN is a great psychological thriller that didn't disappoint!

Mary Torjussen has a wonderfully engrossing writing style and once again I found myself unable to put this book down, reading it in one tension filled afternoon. She\u2019s fast becoming a favourite author of mine, her books tick a lot of my boxes so to speak, and I know I\u2019m in for a rompingly good read when I pick up her novels.It\u2019s always fun recognising places you know within books and Mary\u2019s books are usually set around an area of the North West that I know well which added a nice visual touch for me. And Gemma, the main protagonist was an estate agent which was my career after I had my children, so I felt an affinity with her straight away! Owning her own agency meant a frantic, high pressured working environment which was hard on Gemma as she was the main breadwinner. Her husband stayed home to look after their son and so there was some resentment of their family situation with Gemma feeling that she was missing out on the family life that she works hard to support. When she gets the chance of some time away with some training for work, she welcomes it. But after coincidentally meeting a client at the same hotel, Gemma let\u2019s her guard down and they have dinner together. And after that Gemma has no idea what happened until she wakes up next morning! I could feel her bewilderment and frustration flowing off the pages as Gemma struggled to find out what occurred that night and then her terror as she started to get messages and pictures from that night. Who is doing this to her? Gemma quickly realised that this is personal and she has to find out why she is being targeted before her family falls apart.What I love about this authors books is that she manages to keep me completely in the dark about how her books are going to turn out! The prologue introduced us to a teenage Gemma who was at a party to celebrate the end of her A levels before she went to university. This was obviously important to the plot line and I thought I had an idea why but I was WAY off base! The cleverly crafted storyline weaved its way towards the shocking ending in a thoroughly engaging style that kept me entertained from start to finish. Gemma is a strong minded and likeable character that you can\u2019t help but cheer on, even though sometimes I wanted to shout at her \u201cwhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d. She got herself into some very awkward situations and made some questionable decisions but you couldn\u2019t help but like her.The Girl I Used To Be is an addictive page turner that\u2019s easy to put up but very difficult to put down.

Naturally, I had to request it on Netgalley. This one is more on the lighter side of the thriller genre, but still had a great pacing to it.Gemma Brogan is a real estate agent and wakes up one morning with an awful hangover. Why did she drink so much the night before with a prospective client? Her regrets begin to deepen when she starts receiving mementos in the form of photos, videos, and more from that night depicting some unsavory things that can put her marriage at risk. She doesn't remember any of the events from that night. With the blackmailing continuing, her paranoia causes her life to spiral. With her past creeping up on her she realizes that she can't always outrun those events.I've always loved a good stalker thriller. The blackmailing and mystery of who it could be is always fun and adds to the suspense. You hit Part 2 in the novel and you get the twist which I definitely wasn't expecting. It was nothing earth shattering like you might come to expect in the thriller genre, but remember, this is on the lighter side. I love when a twist happens that you don't see coming!There are so many questions that keep you turning the pages until the very end.

This is my first Mary Torjussen novel, and I have to say, I have no regrets. I will definitely have to check out her other work, and I'm sorry that I haven't done it sooner. I kept seeing awesome reviews for this one popping up from my friends on Goodreads, so I was very intrigued and had entered the giveaway on Goodreads and put in a request on NetGalley only I didn't seem to be getting anywhere. I was very surprised and elated when Mary Torjussen herself assisted in getting me a copy of her novel. The Girl I Used to Be is a psychological thriller that I found to be somewhat of a slow build up, but I wouldn't have it any other way. A slow build up is exactly what is needed here to bring the reader right to the edge. There's some predictability in the storyline, but there is also moments of complete surprise, so in my opinion, this creates a fine balance. The character development was key in this novel, Mary does an excellent job of creating empathy for our protagonist, Gemma. Given her current predicament of being blackmailed, she's also dealing with the struggles of being the primary source of income for her family, and with this, it certainly creates feelings of resentment, frustration, and jealousy. One might say that our antagonist, David is a bit one-dimensional. However, I believe this is completely intentional. Then of course we have Rachel, which I have to say, the lines are blurred with how the reader is supposed to feel about Rachel. Gemma may have her fair share of baggage, but Rachel isn't exactly packing light, she has a haunting past, and it's a toss up on where your empathy will land as a reader. This is that type of novel that leaves you wondering, \"what would I do?\" given the situation. Which always makes for a more interesting read in my opinion, just think of the possibilities. This is a novel driven on jealousy and deceit, two very powerful actions that have devastating consequences, so... with that said, it's no wonder it makes for a compelling read. I want to thank NetGalley, Berkley Publishing Group, and especially Mary Torjussen for allowing me the opportunity to read this novel in exchange for my review."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2657711-denise", "userReview": "Fifteen years ago, Gemma went to a party with her classmates to celebrate exam results. The next day, she was not the girl she used to be.Flash forward to present day in this work of psychological fiction. Gemma is married to Joe and they have a son named Rory. She owns her own business, an estate agency, and Joe is a stay-at-home carer for their child. Gemma works all the time trying to make a go of her business and has several employees. She doesn't think anything of David Sanderson when he comes into the office wanting to be shown some properties and she takes him around but he doesn't buy anything. When Gemma meets him later when she is out of town at a conference, it seems natural for her to offer to buy him dinner -- after all, it's business and he is a client so she can write it off. Great conversation and two bottles of wine later, Emma barely makes it to her room before passing out. Her hangover the next day is fierce. She returns home and gets back to work. It's then that the trouble begins -- in the form of a copy of the restaurant bill sent in the mail. More incriminating pieces are sent and Gemma knows that she can lose everything if her husband finds out that she has not been truthful. NO SPOILERS.The reader experiences the tension as the blackmailing escalates and Gemma is in a state of anxiety not knowing what to do. Of course we want her to just TELL JOE already, and go to police and figure out what is going on, but Gemma has her own way of doing things and wants to figure out who is behind this and why.

I always know a psychological thriller is good when I can\u2019t forget the characters and I don\u2019t want to put the book down. Sometimes I dream about the characters. In The Girl I Used To Be, Gemma Brogman and her husband Joe have a little boy Rory. Joe is a stay-at-home-Dad while Gemma works long hours, seven days a week as a real estate agent. One day Gemma shows a nice looking man (David) a few apartments. Then she heads to London a few days/weeks later for a conference and who is in the restaurant of the hotel but David. He walks her to her room since she is super tipsy and she wakes in the morning not remembering the night before. She soon starts receiving weird messages and photos that she doesn\u2019t remember being taken. Who is blackmailing her? And who is this David?Part one of the book moves along smoothly with small things happening. We learn about Gemma and her husband and we meet her co-workers. We know Gemma is not happy that Joe stays home all the time now and wishes he would go back to work so she could take some time off to spend with Rory. We learn that Joe wants to get out more with his friends and I think he secretly is jealous of Gemma that she is out all the time. Part two really kick up the psychological warfare and reveals what is really happening. I had a very hard time putting this book down.

Now a successful businesswoman, she's \"taken advantage of\" by a shady character who's now sending mysterious messages and demeaning photos. She can't go to the police, nor trust any of her friends to stay mum, because her husband might find out. And if he does, it's for sure he'll immediately stop loving her and take away the young son she loves so much. Instead, she decides to handle everything all by herself - meaning that she must up the ante on her lies until the muck threatens to bury her kneecaps.Stop me if you've read this one before.I have - several times. In fact, it's not all that different from the author's first book, Gone Without a Trace. Although both are well written (which, for the record, is why I'm quite comfortable awarding 4 stars), I can't say I was fond of any of the characters in either book. Here's how it goes: After moving on from her teenage trauma, Gemma Brogan is married to a stay-at-home husband, has a young son named Rory and owns a real estate firm in England. The real estate industry is slowing, though, and to her growing dismay, Gemma's husband Joe just doesn't seem interested in finding a job to boost their income and allow her to slow down her own work pace. The at-home resentment builds, and then Gemma takes an overnight trip to an industry conference where, by her own admission, she gets thoroughly drunk. She can't recall much of what happened, but she knows it was nothing good when she gets an explicit photo and a few other telling messages. To her credit, she does speak with a policewoman, but the discussion never goes anywhere because, remember, she's terrified that someone might find out.And that's where I pretty much tuned out. As I emphasized in my review of the author's first book, I've got zero tolerance for whining, paranoid females who, instead of taking charge, keep digging their own holes deeper (and, as my late mother was fond of saying, don't \"have the sense God gave a little gosling.\") That said, I kept at it, mostly because I'd accepted an advance copy in exchange for an honest review and simply won't go back on my word.And in the end, honestly, I'm quite sure those who don't share my dislike of wimpy \"heroines\" will enjoy this book. It hits all the requisite high notes to qualify as a psychological thriller, serves up twists, turns and surprises - at least for those who haven't traveled this road before - and even comes with what I call a Robert Browning ending (\"God's in His Heaven, all's right with the world\").

She was one of these women who wanted a baby and then wanted her career as well, so hubby was a stay-at-home dad. Then she did nothing but bleat about not seeing her son enough. Women's Lib has a lot to answer for, I think.....anyway, she did get my back up a few times. I did get a little tired by how often she was tired as well. The story's a real pageturner, though, trust me, and there are plenty of shockers along the way. So very cleverly done.There was an oft-repeated error I wondered at. She kept writing \"an flat\" as opposed to \"a flat\". Quite surprised that got through any editing process. She's gone with American spelling throughout, too. Just once she added a set of needless speechmarks but again, her presentation is pretty much flawless. At one point Gemma's advised not to click on a link in an email she received but to type it into the address line herself. I assumed that was a security tip but I've not heard of that before. Perhaps someone reading this review might know ? She also mentioned wakes being held before funerals whereas I always thought they were afterwards.I laughed aloud at the mention of watercolour paints and also got a kick out of the spa game. I will be looking forward to her next book, although need to resign myself to a long wait now."}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/327853-yvonne", "userReview": "Gemma Brogan works non-stop to make her real estate company a success. Her husband is a stay-at-home dad, which is a help to Gemma\u2019s career but she wants more time with their son. She begins to resent her husband not working and the amount of time he spends with their son. However, there\u2019s not much she can do about that now. She\u2019s the one bringing in the money.Then, during a work conference she meets with a client and has a bit too much to drink. She complains about her husband and she shares a kiss with the client. Gemma had so much to drink that she doesn\u2019t remember any of it. When she receives a photo and video of the evening, she panics. Her marriage had enough problems, she didn\u2019t need something she doesn\u2019t even remember. It\u2019s not long before she realizes, this situation is much more indepth than she suspects. It goes way back to a horrible event that occurred fifteen years ago. An event that left permanent scars. This is a gripping story that keeps you on your toes. It\u2019s about a woman trying to get on with her life after a tragic teenage event nearly destroyed her. It\u2019s about a couple trying to come up with a fair way to raise their son and make their financial situation doable. It\u2019s also a tale about revenge and betrayal. Thanks to annonymous threats, it\u2019s also about a woman who becomes paranoid. Her life is torn apart.The Girl I Used To Be is captivating to say the least. I enjoyed trying to untangle the webs of the story Gemma and others in her life created. The characters are well-written and vividly portrayed. It is a full length novel, but I sped right through it. I had to know what was going to happen next. I am definitely going to check out this author\u2019s backlist and keep her on my \u201cmust read\u201d author list.

While there were a few things that didn\u2019t work for me in that book, I was impressed enough by her writing that when THE GIRL I USED TO BE came up, I was willing to review her latest thriller.She doesn\u2019t write series books and for that I am thankful. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love series however sometimes it\u2019s nice to have a full story and resolution in just one book. As a reader it helps me get closure and I personally hate when authors or publishers milk a series just for the sake of churning out another book. In a world of series, I like the odd stand alone book from time to time.THE GIRL I USED TO BE is similar in style to GONE WITHOUT A TRACE\u2026.psychological thriller mixed with a little domestic suspense. I really was intrigued once again by the summary and couldn\u2019t say no to something that sounds like every faithful wife\u2019s worst nightmare! Like many women, Gemma is trying to do it all. Career. Wife. Mother. Everything. And at times it\u2019s overwhelming and as a woman, letting loose seemed like a luxury. She struggles with working so much because she doesn\u2019t get to see her son and her frustration as the \u2018breadwinner\u2019 will easily resonate with a lot of women. Not to mention I was NOT a fan of her husband at all and I could easily sympathize with her situation, struggles, and her frustrations. Gemma seems like the typical modern woman and when a business dinner goes wrong, she\u2019s left with not just shame but a big f-ing problem that went way past just a few drinks too many. Her life has turned upside down into a nightmare.For me, Gemma was not only believable but so real. I think so many women will relate to her and her situation. Though my husband is the breadwinner, I have been in Gemma\u2019s shoes and sometimes it\u2019s just not as ideal as it sounds so I thought that Torjussen did a great job illustrating that point.I totally got sucked into the story right away. Unlike her previous book, this one kept me really really engaged. I don\u2019t know if it was the realness of Gemma or the fact that Gemma was the main narrator, but something about this story worked way better for me than her previous novel.Torjussen does hit the audience with a game changer in part two, it wasn\u2019t like OMG WTF, but it was definitely something that I wasn\u2019t expecting and made me take more notice of the story. I thought she did a great job at \u2018gut checking\u2019 readers to make sure she had their attention. I won\u2019t give anything away but just know that something is coming!The book was interesting and full of a lot of surprises with very real and relatable characters and situations that I think a lot of female readers will enjoy even if they haven\u2019t experienced Gemma\u2019s situations, I still think they are of interest to readers. I know I personally was like make the packages and notes stop!While I wasn\u2019t completely a fan of Torjussen before, after reading this book cemented my enjoyment of her novels. I liked the book I read previously but I didn\u2019t love it but with this book I was much more invested and found a lot more to interest me and propel me forward to the end.

The plot, the characters, their behaviour, and the dialogue were cringe-worthy. I would class it as contemporary fiction, with a bland mystery on the side. Slow paced, stretches of chapters where nothing happened, with twists you can see coming from space. The motivation for the protagonist\u2019s harassment was weak in my opinion, and the harassment itself was pathetic \u2013 it neither escalated, and came across as more of a nuisance than a threat. And there wasn\u2019t one single suspenseful moment \u2013 the entire novel was ludicrous. The main character, Gemma, was particularly dim-witted, and boy did it take her a long time to connect the obvious dots. And for some unknown reason, she had a weird habit of creating outlandish stories to cover up small lies, lies that had little, or sometimes nothing, to do with the plot.But the worst crime for me was the awful dialogue, which admittedly is a pet hate of mine. Much of the dialogue read as stilted and boring, and is not how people speak or relate to one another. Here\u2019s one example;\u2018I\u2019m not working nine to five every day. Occasionally I\u2019m working half-days. Well, more like three-quarter-days. I go in mid-morning sometimes, or finish early and then go back to lock up. Or I come home for a longer lunch\u2019Terrible right! Do we really need to know all that? In another scene it is revealed that two characters are from the same hometown, which prompts a third character to ask if they knew each other back then. Fair enough question right? This is the response;\u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018Obviously I\u2019m older and we went to different schools.\u2019Eh! You could\u2019ve met in numerous other ways. Anyhow, moving on...Also related to the odd dialogue was the unnatural behaviour of everyone. Even though Gemma\u2019s their boss, her employees constantly question her every small decision. Which is fine in itself, there are people like that, but what I found strange was Gemma\u2019s reaction. Instead of reprimanding her staff, she would go into long detailed explanations to justify her reasons. In another part of the book a character arrives home and a neighbour starts grilling said character on their whereabouts the night before. Again, fair enough, nosy or suspicious neighbours are a dime a dozen, especially in this genre, but instead of politely making an exit, or telling the neighbour to mind their own business, the character decided to tell this almost complete stranger where they had been, why they were there, and how long they\u2019d been gone. This sort of behaviour just doesn\u2019t ring true to me, and the novel was littered with these types of interactionsAs you can see I didn\u2019t think much of it. Definitely decide for yourself, and to those that do or have enjoyed it, good on you.

And Gemma will realize just how far the shadows from her past can reach\u2026 (Goodreads)Review:Gemma owns her own real estate company, and needless to say, she is a very busy woman. She has a lot on her plate and sometimes it is not easy for her to handle everything. Having her husband, Joe, be a stay-at-home dad, helps a lot, at least at the beginning. He can take care of their son, Rory, and keep everything in order. But eventually she becomes resentful of Joe\u2019s time with Rory and she feels like her son needs her husband more than her. That is a bitter pill to swallow.When Gemma goes to a real estate conference, she decides to stay overnight so she can rest and relax a little bit. She should have stayed in and done just that. But instead she has dinner and drinks with a potential client. BIG MISTAKE. When she wakes up in the morning she has a killer hangover and not much memory of the night before. Now her troubles are just beginning.The characters are well developed and well rounded. Gemma is a strong woman, much stronger than she realizes. She has had a troubled past but she has worked hard to get past it. Now she has to deal with blackmail and stalking, and she does not know how she will get past this.The author is very talented in creating suspense and tension with just the written. She slowly built up the tension and then just kept it moving throughout the book. She kept throwing in twists and turns and just when I thought I had it all figured out, she threw in another twist. I thought I might get whiplash from reading this book.The writing style flows smoothly and the book is a quick easy read. And it was made even quicker because the reader will have to keep turning pages or swiping the e-reader to find out what is going to happen next, you will not be able to stop yourself.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written psychological suspense thriller. This book is as good as any I have read in this genre. Just be sure you start reading this when you have enough time because you will not want to put it down."}, {"userName": "Roxanne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870392-roxanne", "userReview": "Thank you to Berkley and Netgalley for a copy of the eARC in exchange for a fair review.Gemma is successful real estate agent with her own company.

It is always a fine line especially with thrillers or mysteries. Because the twists are everything and you can say too much and spoil the book.
