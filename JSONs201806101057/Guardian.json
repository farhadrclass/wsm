It is the summer of 1946 and Ansel is fourteen years old. He is the son of the store owner in a small town in the Deep South. One of his best friends is Willie. Though they fish together often, there is always an awareness of their differences solely because of the color of their skin. Ansel is also in love with Mary Susan, daughter of the local pastor, who fairly glows with purity and sexuality. Enter into this an evil spoiled wealthy kid and you have everything it takes to make a lynching.Lester's language is lyrical, somber and almost languid with the heat of the South. He takes the time to examine each person in the story down to their soul. Each person trapped in their own pain, their own decisions. Each with their own guilt and shame. This is done for a reason, so that knowing these people that deeply, one can only feel gut-wrenching, fearful amazement at what they allow to happen. Racism is dealt with head on. Lester doesn't hide the evil of racism, but rather shows that a community and nation this divided must inevitably lead to horror and evil. It is a powerful book for all that it says without being didactic and preaching. It is instead a moment in history caught, captured and revolting.This powerful book with its amazing writing is also invitingly short. High school classrooms will embrace it as a catalyst for discussion of race in America. Even adult book discussion groups should take a look at it. One of the most powerful novels on race I have ever read, this is one of my top teen novels of the year. I can't wait to see the cover art.Appropriate for ages 14-17."}, {"userName": "Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/955972-morgan", "userReview": "This was a pretty horrifying look at lynchings and race relations in the south in 1946, when a young white boy, Ansel, and his friend Little Willie must deal with and are directly confronted with racism at every turn. Ansel, his mother, and mother's friend Esther Davis are sympathetic whites who strongly disagree with the town's views of race--that is, perpetrating the view that blacks are inferior beings, need to be kept in their place, etc. What is horrifying is the character of Zeph Davis III, who is an entitled, supremely racist character who torments Ansel and Little Willie. The drama occurs when Ansel's crush, Mary Susan, is raped and stabbed by Zeph; Big Willie, Willie's father, sees it happen and tells Ansel's father, Bert. Bert knows Zeph is a sociopath and Big Willie is innocent. But for those who read the dedication, you know a lynching is going to happen, and Big Willie is the scapegoat.Lester makes it clear that Willie probably would have been lynched regardless of what Bert said. The point Lester emphasizes repeatedly is that doing nothing and standing by while an innocent man dies is as wrong as the lynching itself--that Bert could have stood up to Zeph (a young boy), said he believed Big Willie, and allowed Big Willie some peace knowing someone believed in his innocence. In the afterword, Lester explains that he was approached by a Hollywood director about writing a movie script for a lynching movie. Lester believed that that story was told and wanted to write it from the white child's perspective--how damaging and cruel it is to expose children to the violence and hatred of a lynching. The director wasn't interested, the deal fell through, and Lester wrote this book, complete with an author's note, bibliography, chart, and appendix. The book is getting three stars because it's too short--there needs to be more--more buildup, more exploration of Ansel's feelings, more understanding of the town's fear of Zeph (he is only 14), just more. Until the lynching happens, I was just wondering who it would be and when, not if it would happen. But, the book is completely realistic and is definitely an unexplored area of young and adult literature--the effects of lynching and that indoctrination on children. A quick read, though one I won't be using in my African American lit class next semester."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Wardrip", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125613-jennifer-wardrip", "userReview": "Reviewed by JodiG. for TeensReadToo.comThere was a dark time in the history of the United States when even the best-intentioned people bore silent witness to the atrocities that were being committed by others. A time in which a person had to chose between honesty and personal safety. It is Tuesday afternoon, a hot summer day in 1946. By Friday night a crime will have been committed, two people will be dead, and fourteen-year-old Ansel Anderson will be forever tormented by the events of that night and those that followed. Ansel lives in Davis, a small town deep in the South. The town was named after the most wealthy and influential family in the area, the family now headed by Zeph Davis. Cap'n Davis has a way of employing his \"negroes\" in such a way that they remain in debt to him, a legal form of slavery. Everyone in Davis knows the rules of the social order. Black people are expected to address all whites - even the children - as \"ma'am\" or \"sir\", they are to move from the sidewalk when a white person is coming, and they are to always be congenial. Even Ansel's best friend, Willie, addresses him as Mister Ansel. Ansel works in his father's store, along with Willie. Bert Anderson is preparing Ansel to take over the store someday, and to be a successful store owner he knows that Ansel has to start considering who he spends time with and what the other people in town think of him. His mother Maureen feels differently. She doesn't like the way the townspeople act and doesn't want her son to grow up with such narrow-minded influences. She has bigger dreams for Ansel, and, along with Esther Davis, Cap'n Davis's sister, she plants the seeds for Ansel to dream of a future beyond Davis. An unfortunate storm is brewing in Davis. Entitlement and anger are swelling in Zeph Davis the Third, the teenage son of Cap'n Davis. But who would believe that the son of a wealthy white man could commit such a heinous act as rape and murder when there was a negroe at the scene of the crime? And even if they do believe, will anyone take the risk of speaking out? GUARDIAN is an amazingly well-crafted story that grabs your attention and your heart from the very beginning. Author Julius Lester has a way of pulling you along in such a way that you can feel the intensity building with every word until the explosive finale. There is no sugar-coating to this story; it is real and it is raw and borne from a very sad reality in our world. If you can read and pass along one book this year, let it be GUARDIAN."}, {"userName": "A_Esther", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7576169-a-esther", "userReview": "Guardian is a gritty tale of a lynching told primarily from the perspective of a young white spectator. Readers meet fourteen year old Ansel Anderson and his Negro friend, Little Willie, as they get permission from Mr. Anderson, the town\u2019s storekeeper, to suspend their work duties and go fishing at a nearby creek; this is a Tuesday afternoon in the summer of 1946. By Friday, the whole town stands by in a party-like atmosphere as they prepare to lynch Big Willie (Little Willie\u2019s father) for the rape and murder of the pastor\u2019s daughter. The only witnesses to Big Willie\u2019s innocence are Mr. Anderson, Ansel, and Zeph (the true perpetrator). Readers find out how the refusal to tell the truth affects the father-son relationship as well as that of the two young boys who were friends just days before.Author Julius Lester tells the story mostly from Ansel\u2019s perspective but occasionally switches to third-person omniscient narration. Through the third-person omniscient narration, character dimensionality is added as readers become privy to the inner thoughts and experiences of the characters. We understand Mr. Anderson\u2019s reluctance to speak up for Big Willie. We understand the casual yet exuberant nature of the crowd, \u201cIt could be the annual Fourth of July picnic\u2026The only thing missing was a pig roasting, but a nigger would do.\u201d Mr. Lester\u2019s language throughout the novel is graphic, brutal, but insightful in a way that only a person who lived in a time and place where lynching was a real threat or a truly gifted dramatist could write. He is both.Because of the explicit sexual and violent language and content, I wouldn\u2019t use this text with students younger than high school. Guardian could be used as part of a social studies unit that deals with the African American experience in the South before the Civil Rights Era. This text could be paired with Leon\u2019s Story by Leon Tillage which tells his family\u2019s story in North Carolina during the same time period. While Leon\u2019s Story is suitable for a younger audience, it provides background knowledge using first-person account of the time. Students should be encouraged to read the author\u2019s note and the appendix which lists the reported lynchings that occurred from 1882-1968 by state."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1647633-angie", "userReview": "This is book gives an insightful look at lynching in the south from the perspective of a white teenager. It also causes the reader to think about keeping silent when you know an injustice has occurred. Holding back the truth is just as harmful as committing the injustice. I would recommend this book for young people and adults as well. I was surprised that lynchings were treated like a sporting event in most cases. We have come a long way as a nation, but we yet have a ways to go. In this day we still have nooses being put up all over the country. Mr. Lester said, \"The racial divide in the US will not be overcome until lynchings of all kinds are as painful to nonblacks as they are to blacks, until each of us become guardians fo the sufferings history has bequeathed us.\" I agree with his feelings.

Here are seven of these characters:Ansel Anderson- a 14-year-old white boy living in a small town in the south in 1946.Bert Anderson- Ansel's father who operates Anderson General Store and helped Big Willie get his job.Maureen Anderson- Ansel's mother.Little Willie Benton- Ansel's black fishing buddy who works with Ansel at the General Store. Big Willie Benton- WWII vet suffering from (undiagnosed PTSD), Little Willie's father. He does odd jobs at Mary Susan's father's church. Mary Susan Dennis- the girl Ansel likes.Zach Davis- Ansel's antagonist and town bully. Great-Grandson of the man who founded the town of Davis, son of the man who owns the largest plantation in the town as well as the store where Ansel's father works and the church where Mary Susan's father is the preacher. Through these multitude of lenses, yet told from the narrator's present tense viewpoint, Mr. Lester has interwoven a story full of deep prejudice and misunderstanding. It is an unconventional style which works well for this topic. The reader intimately sees each character's motivations, fears, and beliefs and feels his or her emotions.James Scott Bell writes: \"A novel usually revolves around a few big scenes. These act like guideposts as the novelist moves from one to the other up through the climax.\" (p.127) The scene you are about to read happens three-quarters of the way into the book and is one of the big scenes in Guardian. Bert and Ansel have just left their store. ********As father and son cross the street to the car, they see Big Willie hurrying out the front door of the church. He looks quickly to his right and left, and seeing Bert and Ansel, he runs to them. \"Mistah Bert, suh! I'm glad it's you. Yes, suh!\" Willie is a tall and rather ungainly young man. His face looks as if it absorbed every death he witnessed, those he was agent of and those he was not. He is wearing a khaki military shirt with a private's stripe on the sleeve. But the shirt is dirty and torn, as if he has not taken it off since his discharge. \"Wasn't me, Mistah Bert. No, suh! I didn't have nothing to do with it, but I know I'm gon' get blamed for it. Something like this happen, nigger gets blamed every time. Yes, suh. Sho' do. But I ain't done it.\" \"What are you talking about, Willie?\" Willie points toward the church. \"I seen him. I seen him just as sho' as I'm seeing you and Mistah Ansel. Yes, such. The young Mistah Zeph.\" Bert hurries to the church and goes inside. In the dim light at the front, he sees and does not want to believe what he sees. \"Ansel! Go outside!\" Instead of doing what his father tells him, Ansel says, \"Papa? What's he doing?\" Zeph Davis the Third turns at the sounds of the voices. In his right hand is a knife. It is slick with blood. On the floor in front of the alter lies a body, the skirt raised to reveal her nakedness. Ansel does not wait for an answer from his father, who is still trying to understand what he is seeing. Ansel screams, \"Mary Susan! Mary Susan!\" and runs to the front of the church. He stops and stares at her nakedness. Then, realizing what he is doing, he pulls down the skirt to cover her. In doing so, he sees a ripped blouse and severed bra. The exposed breasts are red and slick with blood. He wants to stare, but feels that he shouldn't, that Mary Susan would not want him to. He takes the blood-soaked blouse and pulls both sides over her bared breasts, careful not to touch them. Zeph looks rapidly from Ansel to Bert, back and forth, back and forth, breathing heavily, not knowing what to do, what to say. Then he sees Big Willie in the shadows at the back of the church.\"He did it!\" Zeph hours, pointing at Big Willie. \"He did it!\" \"Mistah Bert? Suh, look at me. Ain't no blood nowhere on me. Look at him. He covered with blood, her blood.\" \"You know niggers, Bert!\" Zeph breaks in. \"They do all kinds of stuff with roots. That nigger probably got a mojo that can take blood off his hands.\" \"I seen him, Mistah Bert. I seen him. I was up in the balcony. I likes to sit up there when no one's around. It's real peaceful. \"That's where I was when the preacher's girl, Miz Mary, come in. I wanted to leave right then 'cause I knowed it wouldn't look good if I was alone in the same place with a white woman. But wasn't no way I could get out without her hearing. Seeing' me, she might get the wrong idea and start screaming. So I just stayed still. \"She went to the altar and knelt down to pray. I wondered what could be weighing so heaving on the heart of someone as young as she was. If she'd been a nigger gal, I could understand. Us niggers need all the prayer we can get. Yes, suh. \"Miz Mary hadn't been there long when I heard the door of the church open and he come in. I thought maybe the two of them had decided to meet up together at the church, but when she turned around to see who it was had come in and seen it was him she say, 'What do you want? You get on outta here and leave me alone. I'm praying.' \"He don't pay no mind to what she say. He go up to her and grab her try to kiss her. She push him away. She say, 'Get away from me or I'll kick you so hard you won't be able to move for a month.' \"That's when he whipped out his knife and before she could do anything, he was on her, stabbing her over and over. Then I seen him raise up her skirt, and I didn't want to see no more. Mistah Zeph was so caught up in what he was doing that he didn't see me, and I hurried out and that's when I seen you and your boy. That's the God's truth, Mistah Bert. You believe me, don't you? You'll tell the white folks it wasn't me. Won't you Mistah Berth?\" \"Who you going to belive, Bert? A nigger or a white man?\" Zeph notices that Bert is hesitating, that Bert is thinking about what the right thing to do is, and Zeph drops the knife on the floor next to Mary Susan's body, runs up the aisle and out of the church. \"Rape! Rape! Pastor's daughter been raped by a nigger!\" Zeph is running and yelling at the same time. Over and over he shouts and the only words that are clear are \"rape\" and \"nigger.\" pp. 71-75.********Mr. Bell asks:Was this an action scene? No question. This scene demonstrates high intensity with \"tremendous conflict, important emotions, sharp dialogue, and inner turmoil.\" (Bell, p.128)Identify the places where you learn about the character's objective in the scene and the conflict:Big Willie's speech when he meets Ansel and Bert show how he wants his name cleared. That is repeated at the close of the scene bookending his desperation. Conflict roars to life through Zeph's false accusation. Entering the church, Ansel wants to see what has disturbed his father. His internal conflict in seeing Mary Susan is demonstrated in his actions.Zeph's anger at being rebuffed again (this is not the first time Mary Susan rejects him) leads to his objective: revenge. His conflict is visible in his brief hesitation after his sociopathic behavior. Bert wants not to see what is plain before his eyes. Afterwards, he also hesitates, showing his internal conflict. How does the scene end?Zeph leaves the church and \"Over and over he shouts and the only words that are clear are 'rape' and 'nigger.' The reader knows that this certainly means disaster for Big Willie and sets up the scenes which, like soldiers falling in battle, will surely follow. Do you want to read on? I'm going to leave this question up to you. Even though you have a strong sense of what's going to happen next, are you pulled into the next scene? Why or why not?Jim Bell writes, \"...you need to end scenes with a prompt, something to make readers turn the page...Don't ever let your scenes fizzle out, ending on a boring note.\" (p. 124).It seems to me, that Julius Lester has done just that.

He wants nothing to do with \"their kind\".In the space of a week, everything Ansel thought about his world changes and nothing will be the same.The story is powerful but confusing.

This book is about a lynching. You need to know that right off the bat. The second thing you need to know is that it's about a white boy's experience of a lynching. Specifically, it's about Ansel Anderson, who has to watch as his black friend Little Willie's father is lynched for a rape and murder committed by Zeph Davis III, grandson of the town's founder. Worse, Ansel and his father know that Big Willie saw the crime committed, and they saw the immediate aftermath. That's the core of the book, but the emotional arc belongs to Ansel. There's a complicated series of reasons as to why he's sympathetic to black people to begin with, but it is perfectly believable, and so is Little Willie's reaction to everything: there's actually a part I loved after the lynching where Ansel runs to Willie to apologize, and then stops, because he knows that he can't ask forgiveness of Willie, not after what happened.It's a really good book. If it has a flaw, the ending is too abrupt; there's a lot of buildup and character development before the lynching, and then after it's like ten pages to the end.

He spends most days working in his family's general mercantile store. When he is given some free time, he prefers to roam in the woods around town with his best friend, Willie. Willie works as a stockroom employee for Ansel's father Bert. This friendship has a pivotal role in the story, as Bert is a bit of a white supremacist, and Willie is black. Ansel's mother Maureen is the complete opposite, actually growing quite disgusted at her husband's opinions but he shrugs off his beliefs as \"hey, it's the way the world is..\" Maureen gets to the point where she fears Ansel possibly one day being influenced by his father's racism, so she does her best to come up with a way to get her son out of town.Before that happens though, Ansel sees multiple sexual attacks brought upon Mary Anne, a neighborhood girl he cares deeply for; attached to those assaults, Ansel later witnesses a hate crime that leaves an innocent man dead. For the rest of his life Ansel is wracked with guilt over not being more vocal about bringing actual criminals to justice, rather than allowing innocent bystanders to take the fall. Even being just under 130 pages, this story is quite the historical fiction gut punch! One of those ones that never promises to be a cheerful or even fun read, but most definitely an important one. The town of Davis in this story is one chock full of racists, with just a few residents -- among them Ansel, and Esther Davis, a member of the richest and one of the most racist families in town, having earned much of their wealth from running a cotton plantation primarily staffed by black employees. Esther is one of the few white people in town who offer medical help to assaulted black employees (usually females who have been raped by her nephew Zeph) or bring food to much older employees who struggle to maintain the strength for cotton picking. Any push toward change in the general thinking of a society is a start, but as you can imagine, with the winds of change largely being carried by just two or three people at a time, it can be an uphill battle for some time. Author Julius Lester doesn't hold back in his desire to educate his readers on this grim period of history. In fact, there are pages at the back of the book just of charts showing the lynching percentages for all the lower 48 states between 1882-1968. The inclusion of this historical data shows the reader that hate doesn't see color, whites and blacks alike being victimized (though the higher percentage is with the African American community). While lynching may not be as common an occurrence in today's world, racism and hate crimes most definitely are still going strong. The take away from this novella is that the hate just needs to end. Full stop. A tall order, I know, one that may not happen in this lifetime, but stories like this one inspire me to keep doing my part to push for more love, everywhere to everyone. It makes me hopeful for a time that sees the end of the killing of innocents, the end of putting everyone in a category, the end of racial blanket statements altogether -- \"white people be like\" / \"black people be like\", etc. Stories like Guardian make me hopeful for a time when people can just embrace the awesomeness of cultural variety!Though Lester's writing style made this as much of an enjoyable reading experience for me as this sort of topic can be, this book is truly a tough read. But as I said earlier, an important one. Sometimes reality and truth stings but you still gotta feel and hear it to make you a better, more empathetic person. POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING: There are a number of scenes that prove tough to stomach in this short story. Among them, a teen girl getting violently sexually assaulted and a frog slowly being dismembered by a sociopath while still alive."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1465254-rose", "userReview": "No one loves Neil Gaiman\u2019s dark little fairy tale Coraline more than I do. The ageless Miss Jones, with her classic kiddy curiosity and British sass, gives Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice a run for her money. Plus there is something romantic and enduring about Gaiman\u2019s 10-year saga to write her story; he began writing Coraline years before beginning his acclaimed Neverwhere, published in 1996, as he says, writing quietly and observing.Of course, Henry Selick\u2019s film adaptation had problems for me; Coraline is NOT from Michigan, for one! Still, there\u2019s a lot to be said for bringing children\u2019s books to the big screen: the stories and characters on the page really do leap to life in a new way. Seeing the film last week made me want to read the novel for, yet, a 17th time. But alas, this isn\u2019t a film column. So, here\u2019s my tie-in, another children\u2019s book I\u2019d like to see adapted for film: Julius Lester\u2019s Guardian.For the past couple of seasons, February has been marked on my calendar as \u201cThe Month of the Other Mother\u201d, but we\u2019re also smack in the middle of Black History Month. I can\u2019t help but feel the way I did in sixth grade, with the dull walls of my school suddenly postered with the month\u2019s significance: pictures of Harriet Tubman, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Maxine Waters lining the hallways. So, stumbling across Lester\u2019s Guardian was one calendar-appropriate sign (cue the choir) that has returned me to childhood.Guardian tells the story of 14-year-old Ansel, the thoughtful son of Bert, a two-faced general store owner. Both have different relationships with local African-Americans (For Bert, they are only his livelihood, his customers; but Ansel\u2019s best friend growing up is Willie, his father\u2019s Black stock boy) and with what it means to be White. When the two witness a crime that leads to the lynching of close friend, Ansel learns the true meaning of death and of the other consequences for his silence.Lester\u2019s Guardian resides in Deep South, U.S.A. The town of Davis welcomes newcomers and passersby with a looming statue of a Confederate soldier aiming his rifle at those who dare enter its town square. Racism is the expected occurrence in this Jim Crow-era story and is as predictable as the lynchings that regularly steal the show in the sleepy town. What I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for was the depth of characters with which Lester populates Davis. The author provides such a rich back story for characters like Ester Davis, the rich, progressive-minded spinster, for Ansel\u2019s mother, Maureen, who\u2019s not as meek as she seems, and for Zeph Davis, III, Ansel\u2019s 16-year-old archnemisis who proves fatally evil. Each of these characters have enough stories to fill their own books.Lester is also incredibly connected to nature in this book, utilizing a primary natural tool in lynchings\u2013trees\u2013and personifying them.

Julius Lester is a Newberry Honoree and Coretta Scott King Award winner. After reading this book I am not surprised he is an award winning author. \"Guardian\" is an emotional, unforgettable and painful story about life in a Southern town named Davis in 1946. Because the story is full of racial tension I would recommend this book for older teens; However, librarians might differ with me. I loved this book because it is about a small town. Another part of me hated reading about this small town which was typical of so many southern towns during this time. A small town where we are shown the brutal face of racism during this period. To back up his story Julius Lester piles on the facts including a chart of statistical information. Then, there is always the other side of the coin. We have come so far from the days when so much behavior was questioned, just not allowed and/or just called plain out criminal. I especially enjoyed reading about the friendship between Ansel and Willie. These two boys are so different. One difference, besides race, is that Willie's father is mentally unstable. Just imagine how this must seem very stressful and perplexing to a child. Before the summer is over both boys will have changed and matured. It is unfortunate that both boys will learn \"Trees remember.\" The cover of the book is awesome giving a bit of an idea what the boys will see in Ansel's fourteenth summer."}, {"userName": "Kellyflower", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2484776-kellyflower", "userReview": "to sum up the book I'm gonna use two quotes from it:\"While the subject matter is lynching, on a deeper level, this novel is about identity. Whom and what we identify ourselves with determines our characters, determines who we are, and what we do.\" ~Julius Lester\"....the racial divides in the United States will not be overcome until lynchings of all kinds are as painful to nonblacks as they are to blacks, until each of us become guardians of the sufferings history has bequeathed us.\" ~Julius Lester Also I loved the first two pages of this book and if I had more time I would quote the whole two pages here.But I'll just quote a small part:\"But there are times when a tree can no longer withstand the pain inflicted on it, and the wind will take pity on that tree and topple it over in a mighty storm. All the other trees who witnessed the evil look down upon the fallen tree with envy. They pray for the day when a wind will end their suffering.

It was all about the lynchings that happened in the South and it was very informative. One thing I did notice about this book, is that pretty much every white guy was a pig. It was just disgusting and I wanted to just slap all of them. I can't believe stuff like this actually happened and it just blows my mind how badly black people were mistreated. It also gives a look into how perverted and sick some men are. Not only were black people mistreated, but a lot of white women were mistreated as well. Women were thought of as their husbands property which just disgusted me.Language: 3- No F bombs but lots of the other swear words. They are used as insults more than just swearing as well.Sex: 4- Ok, this book has A LOT of sexual content. First, there are a few scenes of a boy and girl messing around in a nasty way they were not even having sex. Then they finally do and that's pretty awful too. The next is a boy who rapes a girl and kills her.Violence: 4- There is a pretty disturbing scene where a black man gets lynched. There is also the scene where the girl is killed and raped. You don't read about it while it's happening, but the main character finds the guy doing it and its bloody and nasty.Drugs/Alcohol: 2- It's the south so there is some drinking. There isn't really any partying or teenage drinking though."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2424743-brenda", "userReview": "This is a historical fiction book based in a small Southern town in 1946. A young black teenager is accused, wrongly, of attempting to rape and the murder a white girl and is lynched for his crimes. It is also the story of Ansel, a fourteen-year-old white boy who knows the truth but is too scared to speak up. This book surprised me in two different ways. First, the story was so engrossing which took me back a little. I read the book flap and wasn't all that interested in reading yet another historical book about the civil rights struggle (no offense, it just seems to be one of those eras where there are a lot of books about). But I found that once I started, I couldn't put it down. It was very good and the writing of the characters made you feel like you were there. They were fully-fleshed out, especially Ansel whose point of view the story is from. For this, the book stands out. The other area that surprised me was the length of the story versus the amount of sexual content. The author could have left some of the sexual scenes a little more up to the reader's imagination and focused more on the moral aspects of lynching and what it does to the community. If the author could have made the story longer with more about the community coming to gripes with what it did, I would be satisfied."}, {"userName": "P", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1586060-p", "userReview": "Set in 1946 in a Southern town called Davis \u2013 named for its wealthy slaveholding founders and their kin who still remain in complete control of the town - this is the story of 14-year old Ansel\u2019s coming of age as he witnesses a racial hate crime against his boyhood friend\u2019s father who is charged with a crime that he did not commit. Yet Ansel\u2019s father encourages him to deny the truth. Ansel\u2019s observations encompass the victim, the victim\u2019s family and the local townspeople\u2019s reactions to the event. In the end, Ansel is helped by a turn of events set into motion by his unlikely mother - an introverted and repressed housewife. But the lynching has changed him forever. The story takes place primarily over 5 days but the consequences of the events that take place in those 5 days span several lifetimes and the author captures this foreshadowing with especially thought-provoking and poignantly charged language. The epilogue features true recorded accounts of actual lynchings as well as the accounts of the abhorrent behavior of the townspeople such as selling food and drink at the event and taking photos beside the hung man. 124 pages long, this book is a difficult, but necessary read.

Ansel is a 14 yr old growing up in rural Atlanta in a very racial town named Davis in 1946. He\u2019s the son of the local general store owner who tries to make everyone happy and acts just right so as not to ruffle anyone\u2019s feathers. Ansel is a good kid. He has a crush on the pastors daughter Mary Susan, he has a caring mother, who hates the racism of the town, and a close friend, Little Willie\u2026who happens to be black. Bert his father isn\u2019t happy about it but Ms. Davis asked him to give Little Willie a job and no one says \u201cno\u201d to a Davis. Ms. Ester Davis isn\u2019t like the rest of the town. She was educated in Massachusetts and only returned to help take care of her ailing father, who God apparently punished for his wrong deeds by making him die a slow 10 yr death. Ester is unhappy watching her younger brother Zeph torture the blacks in town with his son Zeph following suit and worse yet. In the short few days this 78 pg story takes place, Ansel & Willie\u2019s lives are permanently changed. I agree with the author, Julius Lester, the story was unique & startling to present all the ugliness of racism & lynching from a white persons point of view; who had to live with the knowledge of \"what if\u2026\""}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/681537-allison", "userReview": "This is not an easy book to read. In a small southern town in 1946, racism runs rampant and lynchings are not uncommon. Ansel's Dad hires a young black boy to help out at the store and to his father's horror, Ansel and Willie become friends. Esther Davis, an older white woman, despises the backwards thinking of the white folks in her small, dead town and has the money to make miracles happen for a few. When Big Willie, Willie's Dad is accused of the unthinkable, the community ignores those who are defending him, those who know that Big Willie is, in fact innocent. A white man has committed the horrific crime and everyone ignores this fact. Big Willie must die. Can Esther Davis make miracles happen for Ansel & Willie's families? Told from a white boy's perspective, this is an unusual look at racism and lynchings. Lester's notes at the end are truly interesting. I don't always care for author's notes because they can be well...snooty or something. His were educational and made me want to read a series of correspondence published in the NYT in 1970 about photos taken at lynchings that were made into postcards."}, {"userName": "Krista the Krazy Kataloguer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/316102-krista-the-krazy-kataloguer", "userReview": "What a powerful novel! Lester writes here about the lynching of a black man in post-WWII Alabama, as told from the point of view of a white boy. I've never read a novel where the Jim Crow South was depicted so vividly. It wasn't easy to be black then, having to watch every word and everything you did, for fear of being seen as \"uppity.\" And, if you were white and not racist, it was just as difficult to survive in a society that could cut you off from itself for being a \"nigger lover.\" I just don't understand how people can live with such unreasonable hate in their hearts, and how non-racist white people could stand to live there and do nothing about the injustices around them. Lester provides a long author's note at the end of the book, providing statistics about lynchings in all 50 states as well as information about how he came to write the book. This would make a great read in a college sociology class or an American history class, providing plenty of discussion material. A disturbing read that stays with you long after you've closed the book.

I can see that Lester is delving into the grey areas of ethics and morality, but somehow it didn't work for me. It could have been the omniscient narration he used. It could have been that not only was a white, blond-haired girl killed by the town sociopath who is also the descendant of the plantation owners, it turns out that she was probably abused by her dad who, oh yeah, happens to be the town preacher. And not only does the main kid have to live with the guilt of witnessing a lynching of his best friend's father (that he could have protested) for the rest of his life, his mom also has to kill herself instead of escaping their town with him and moving north.

He works at his father's store, and is expected to take over his father's business. The story began slowly for me, but once I got started reading, the book became more compelling. At the end of the book, the author explains his perspective, as a black man, born in 1939. He grew up with an awareness that lynching could be his fate as a black man. He writes the book from the perspective of a white boy, and explores the many different aspects of bigotry and prejudice. Ansel is tested in ways he never thought possible. The book explores his relationships between each of his parents, his love interest, his community, and his friend. His relationships are further complicated because of his multicultural friendship, and his father's bigotry. I would recommend this book to boys or girls. There is a rape in the story, as well as a murder, and lynching. It's a short book, but powerful.

Mr. Lester chose to concentrate mainly on how viewing a lynching would affect a white child or teen whose parents took them the event. This approach makes this novel stand apart from most others on this topic which tend to delve into the outcome this injustice had on the black community. At the end of the book the author gives some pertinent and disturbing facts about the history of this heinous deed and even cites lynchings taking place up to 1968 (the fact that as late as that date these acts were still being committed is appalling). Unfortunately, Mr. Lester also relates how there are still thinly veiled threats even today in the form of nooses being placed where a person will see them."}], "description": "There are times when a tree can no longer withstand the pain inflicted on it, and the wind will take pity on that tree and topple it over in a mighty storm.
