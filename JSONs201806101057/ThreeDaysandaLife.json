Set in the small town of Beauval, where everyone knows everyone, this is a dark literary novel that explores crime and punishment with regard to Antoine. It all begins with Ulysses, a dog that is hit by a car, and is then shot to put it out of its misery. Banned from being with friends obsessed with games on playstations, a solitary Antoine finds comfort and companionship with Ulysses. He is desperately upset and distressed in the woods, where he had been secretly constructing a tree house when Remi's death occurs. His vivid imagination supplies him with fearsome consequent scenarios that would befall him as a child murderer and how it would affect his mother, this drives his decision to hide the body in the woods.Lemaitre paints a picture of a small community, seething with petty jealousies and resentments, that initially comes to organise searches for the missing Remi. The police are called in, and question a highly stressed boy slowly coming apart as he thinks of running away. Rumours and suspicions abound, fuelled by arrests of a teacher and Monsieur Kowalski, aka Frankenstein, a butcher for whom Madame Courtin works. His mother views Kowalski with contempt, so Antoine feels no remorse for what the butcher has to go through. His concern is for himself as he imagines himself being hauled in for the murder as the community are in the process of searching the woods. Antoine escapes detection as devastating storms and floods splinter peoples lives apart, and the business of surviving and rebuilding becomes the overriding priority and the search for Remi disintegrates. Antoine's life moves on but he can never forget. He becomes a medic and is engaged to Laura when at his mother's insistence he returns to Beauval for a party. A careless drunken sexual act with someone from the past has unexpected repercussions for Antoine as Remi's body is discovered.Lemaitre displays a real talent in being able to enter the mind of a 12 year old boy and capture the tumultuous feelings, stresses and emotions in a way that feels so desperately authentic. All this is achieved amidst the background of Beauval, riddled with a morass of human frailties and personal relationships with a long history, so some seek vengeance and judgement at the most inappropriate times, displaying their inhumanity in public. All this history shapes the community response to the missing Remi and his family, and their commitment to finding him. This is a story of twists, suspense and dark thrills. It takes as its starting point a 12 year old boy who finds himself committing an act he never meant, and then follows through on its implications, many unexpected, and how they define Antoine's entire life. It raises issues of morality and asks whether what happens to Antoine is punishment enough? Is it too much? What would have happened if Antoine had been honest? If you are looking for something different in the field of psychological crime fiction, this would be an excellent novel to read. Many thanks to Quercus for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "This s a psychological novel in the truest sense. A young 12 year old boy, Antoine, commits an horrible act, accidentally but he hides the evidence. Twelve years later he makes another mistake, which will alter his life's path. These two mistakes will haunt him, and it is the chance of discovery of his first act that creates the suspense, his second mistake will help bring things full circle.I never read this authors first three, highly rated books because from the many trusted reviews I read I felt they might be too grisly for me. This one was close to perfect. Any author that can create such a feeling of suspense, without resorting to untold violence, descriptions of blood and gore, with characters it is easy to dislike, and do it as well as I thought this author did, is a fantastic writer in my book. The feelings of desperation that haunt Antoine at times, trying to figure out what to do, where to go, were fantastically portrayed. How the author ties up the loose ends and brings everything to a surprising close was amazingly done. Was quite blown away by this book, dark yes but a satisfying read. Just when you think you were ready to give up psychologically twisty novels, one like this comes along, and makes one second guess themselves.

Antoine is a man whose life has been shaped and molded by two terrible decisions twelve years apart. As a child, he lashed out in violence... resulting in the death of a six year old friend. Twelve years later, as a man who has never faced punishment for that crime, he cheats on the woman he loves. Both of these actions irrevocably change his life. Considering how far apart these actions take place, you'd think they'd be spoilers... but they aren't. They're both featured in the blurb for the book. This story isn't really about mystery or suspense, it's about Antoine. He's a man who despite everything, has his freedom, a promising future as a doctor, and the love of a good woman... but can he hold onto them? An enjoyable piece of noir fiction, and a quick read at just over 200 pages. I read it in two sittings. It was quite different from the books I usually pick up, but I'm glad I did. At times the names and characters were hard to keep track of, so I was happy to read an e-book where I could easily highlight and look back. This book won't be for every mystery fan, but if you're in the mood for a slow burn more character driven and a little different, give it a shot. I received an ARC of this book from Net Galley and Quercus, thank you! My review is honest and unbiased."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9809518-christine", "userReview": "Three Days and a Life\u00a0is my introduction to Pierre Lemaitre. I couldn't be more impressed. This is French noir. A true psychological study, into what happens when the wrong path is taken. Lemaitre gives us the most chilling account of a few days in the life of a child killer. It is incredible.Three Days and a Life follows a twelve year old boy, in a rural town in France. Antoine seems to be an average lad, on the brink of being a teenager. He comes from a single parent family. He is lives in the very uninspiring Beauvil. The time is 1999, so it is set within recent memory. Antoine is devastated, when a neighbour's dog is killed. He loved that dog. This seems to set off a chain of events.Antoine accidently kills a neighbour's child. It is a moment of rage, directed inappropriately. Instead of holding up his hand and admitting to the crime, Antoine makes a curious choice. He decides to hide the body and pretend it didn't happen. He does not tell another soul. He walks away. His decision leads to increasing guilt. We quickly see that Antoine is suffering a living hell. He becomes very fearful of being exposed. All the scenerios that could possibly take place race through his mind. We hear his psychological agony. He is trapped. He fears than at any moment fingers will point in his direction. Guilty! He wants to run away. He cannot even access his saving's accounts. So he has to stay. Reni, a six year old local boy, is soon declared missing. Everyone is looking for him. What happened to Reni? Only Antoine knows the truth.The beauty of Three Days and a Life is that we believe in Antoine. His voice as a child is very strong. It is an authentic account of escalating tension and fear. Very moving. Antoine could easily speak out and tell the truth. Time and time again, he chooses not to. We get a glimpse into an adult Antoine. This man bears the scars of murder. Antoine behaves like an arrogant idiot, with a recklessness that catches up with him.I loved this. Lemaitre is an expert, at exploring the horror of Antoine's unique situation. Anyone who wants to know how to write escalating tension and true pyschological fear, should read this. Marvellous! Totally recommended."}, {"userName": "Abby (Crime by the Book)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45237578-abby-crime-by-the-book", "userReview": "Read my full review: http://crimebythebook.com/blog/2017/8... This one is very, VERY different from Lemaitre's previous books. Reviewing it was actually so difficult -- I review every book from a crime reader perspective, and this book most likely won't be the right choice for crime readers. It's better understood as an interpersonal drama and a portrait of a man growing up under the burden of a terrible secret from his childhood. I highly recommend Lemaitre's backlist for crime fiction readers (BLOOD WEDDING is absolutely brilliant!), but definitely read my full review before purchasing this one."}, {"userName": "Nat\u00e0lia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12278346-nat-lia", "userReview": "Un Lemaitre diferente a lo que nos tiene acostumbrados.

Clearly, I enjoyed it, but I can't quite work out what it was about it that I liked so much, and then how I can get that across in my review. Let's go through this one step at a time...This book is very much about neighbourly relationships. It's based in the small village of Beauval where everyone knows everyone, there are friends in the village and there are enemies. They live everyday surrounded by people who know everything about them. There are a load of books about the small-town-mentality at the moment, it's clearly a very \"in\" thing for authors at the moment. Some of them I like, others I find boring or distressing. This one was just perfect for me!We begin the novel in 1999 and this is where we get most of the small-town vibes. We meet Antoine and his mother, whose only worry is to keep up with appearances. We meet the neighbours, the Desmedt's and Mouchottes. We meet the town butcher, Monsieur Kowalski. We meet the Weiser's - the mayor and his son Theo. We meet a lot of different people, but they all have a very important role to play within the story.It's the 23rd December 1999 and little Remi Desmedt has gone missing. There are plenty of the theories as to his disappearance, but we know what's happened to him, and we know where he is. What follows is a slow paced novel about the effects of Remi's disappearance on the town and the theories and judgments each villager makes on anyone suspected of having taken the young boy.The majority of this novel is set in the few days after Remi's disappearance in 1999. This was definitely my favourite part of the novel. It was enjoyable to follow the story through Antoine's mind-set, who is 12 at the time. But as we move through the story, we meet Antoine again in 2011 and then again in 2015, but these parts of the book aren't as enjoyable to read.As we progress through the novel, Antoine keeps coming up against challenges he needs to overcome. Will he do the right thing, or will he do anything to keep his secrets close? Like I said before, this novel is slow paced, but I quite like that in a books sometimes. This is advertised as a thriller but I wouldn't think of is like that, this feels more like a general fiction novel to be honest. This was also described as \"suspenseful\", but again, I'm going to disagree with that. See what I mean about not being able to describe my feelings on it? I'm at a loss for words on what I feel this books was like! What I can say is that I love Lemaitre's way of writing. It really sucked me into the story and for this reason, I'm definitely checking out his other stuff!Something I also know is that I enjoyed this book, for the most part. If it hadn't been for the 2011 and 2015 chapters, and the direction they took, this could have been a 5 star read for me."}, {"userName": "jo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL":

Unlike those police procedurals, this was more a psychological study of the main character, Antoine Courtin. The synopsis describes completely the plot, leaving out only the conclusion to the depressing story. The first half of the book seemed very slow and plodding as it focused entirely on the day that Antoine kills the little boy and the immediate aftermath. The narrative picks up intensity when it resumes 10 years later -- Antoine is finishing up medical school, is in love with Laura, and has almost -- but not completely, forgotten what happened back in Beauval. He has managed to put what happened to Remi Desmedt safely away and feels he has finally escaped events and his home town. Unfortunately Antoine becomes enmeshed in yet another drama while visiting his mother back at home. The writing is interesting and full of details about small town life and the inhabitants of Beauval. The character of Antoine is multidimensional and one is not sure whether to hope he gets away with his crime or to wish for him to get his just punishment. Antoine's resignation and acceptance of his defeat are such that I willed for him to get some sort of backbone, to make a stand, rather than to continually let events wash over him. The sword of Damocles constantly over his head...I'll always read the next books by this author, but I prefer the suspense thrillers to angsty dramas. Fans won't want to miss this one even so.

With so many greats before him (Simenon, Garnier, Manchester, for example) I guess it's no surprise that more excellent French writing would follow. Three Days and a Life is not French noir is the traditional sense though, though it is dark. Though the subject of missing children has been a reasonably common one in the last few years Lemaitre manages to make his story innovative and refreshing. Set in a small French village the large part of the novel is concerned with 12 year old Antoine, and the effect that the missing child (6 year old Remi) has on him.

It's hard to read one book by an author that just WOWS you (Blood Wedding) and then not expect the same from the next book. It's also unfair as this one is completely different from Blood Wedding and brilliant in its own right. We get a twisty, gritty read from Blood Wedding and then we get deep into the characterization of Antoine in Three Days and a Life.The blurb pretty much tells you the whole story. What the book does is put you deep into the mind of Antoine. The murder he commits at twelve years of age continues to haunt him well into adulthood... forcing him to make interesting decisions. Lemaitre does a good job in showing the sociopathic side of Antoine. I absolutely despised Antoine's character but how strongly I felt about him is a testament to how well Lemaitre wrote him. I think my mood didn't let me appreciate this book as much as I should have. Or maybe my preference is more action/thriller paced over this type of read.If you're looking for your typical crime fiction/psychological thriller then this is probably not a good choice for you.

But after reading this book and then re-reading the summery prior to writing the review, I realised how much detail it already included, but it doesn\u2019t take away from the story. It is a story about the mental journey from 1999 to 2015.This book is a noir fiction. it focuses on Antoine Coutin from the small French town of Beauval, and the way he deals with the accidental killing of a younger boy. It is a very well laid out story from the outset. The reader is introduced to the setting and the characters. It discusses their relationships and dynamics within their various groups. The first half of the book deals with 1999, the lead up to the death, the death itself and the thoughts of Antoine as he deals with what he has done. His state of mind, what his first responses are, the way he thinks through the consequences and how thinks people look at him now. From then a leap forward to the year 2011, now older, Antoine\u2019s state of mind as he has moved on, but how he still deals with occasional troubled thoughts and dreams. Then another jump to 2015 to tell of where Antoine is and how he is still dealing with the event. The setting has been very well described, the author has managed to build a very convincing visual image of the town, it\u2019s surroundings and also the time of year. As each of these time jumps occur, the author has included a brief explanation of events as the story then continues.I found this very different to a previous book by Lemaitre and was very surprised by the contrast in styles. This is well laid out as it explains the way the main protagonist thinks. It comes across as quite a subtle story, it is one that just gradually consumed me, the way that Lemaitre has very cleverly explored the way a 12-year-old may see the world, his thoughts, actions and consequences was very addictive reading. I read this in one sitting, almost a novella sized book. The story leads the reader and by the end was absorbed, but when the end arrives there is a sudden twist, that completely blindsided me. Finishing this on a high.I would recommend this to readers of noir fiction, of psychological fiction, as well as readers of general fiction, murder and mystery genres."}, {"userName": "Raven", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5973984-raven", "userReview": "Being a confirmed admirer of Pierre Lemaitre\u2019s books to date, I rather enjoyed the subtle shift of style and location that Three Days And A Life reveals. Turning his attention away from the big city to the rural backwater of Beauval, Lemaitre constructs a slower and more introspective novel than we have come to expect from him, but equally\u00a0produces a more heightened, and psychologically deft portrayal of human frailty and morality\u2026Time after time, I become disappointed, and as you know more than a little incensed, by the unnatural narrative voice given to young protagonists. Consequently I avoid reading many books that have a pre-sixteen narrator or central character. With Antoine,\u00a0the dislikeable little person that he is, Lemaitre captures beautifully his perception of the world, and\u00a0his reactions to the\u00a0consequences of his severe misdemeanour. Antoine is realistically imbued with a child\u2019s thought processes, as to how to conceal and\u00a0avoid punishment of his crime, and I enjoyed the authenticity of his under-developed sense of morality, which he seems to carry quite happily into his adult years too. I thought the portrayal of his mother was also excellent, and how Antoine\u2019s childish perception of her as just his mother\u00a0actually spoke volumes to the reader about her true emotional state. Equally, I loved the depiction of parochial\u00a0small town jealousies, and ill-feeling, that reminded me of the observational prowess, and skewed morality that\u00a0is so familiar in the works of the late Pascal Garnier. Lemaitre reveals a boiling pot of tension and envy that perfectly fits with the feel of a small community under pressure, and the\u00a0distrust of their neighbours.The latter stages of the book\u00a0are hewed from Antoine\u2019s re-visitation of childhood events from an adult perspective,\u00a0and Lemaitre\u2019s control of his narrative once again comes to the fore. With Antoine being as utterly self-absorbed as he was as a child, but perhaps with a greater perception of the fall out for others from his actions, and indeed, closer to home, there is another twist in store for the reader, and there was me beginning to worry that the king of the psychological twist would disappoint! Once again, a precise and engaging translation from Frank Wynne allows us to fully appreciate this tawdry and morally ambiguous tale of childhood mistakes, and Lemaitre has\u00a0again demonstrated\u00a0his flexibility and natural flair as a storyteller. Three Days And A Life is entertaining, thought-provoking, and as always highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21528136-fiona", "userReview": "Der zw\u00f6lf-j\u00e4hrige Antoine macht den Fehler seines Lebens.

Unlike Blood Wedding, the pace is much slower in this one, the plot isn\u2019t complex, the writing style is simple so despite the slow pace, this was still a quick read. It\u2019s what I\u2019d call a \u2018silent thriller,\u2019 there are no shocking twists or turns but by avoiding the use of the first-person narrative, Lemaitre slowly builds suspense as Antoine\u2019s story is told to us. Sadly, for me, the suspenseful nature of this book was a bit bland, I had the misfortune of reading a different synopsis to the one provided above and this spoilt the read for me because it detailed everything that happened in the book; so, when nothing other than exactly what I\u2019d read in that synopsis occurred, I was disappointed. Nothing really excited me until page 190 [of 221] when I thought a twist was coming.The synopsis above, provided by the publisher, is accurate and creates the right level of mystery and suspense for the reader so I imagine you\u2019ll enjoy this one way more than me if/when you read it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I did like this book, but it wasn\u2019t nowhere near the level of good I was expecting \u2013 a 3 stars read, it\u2019s one I\u2019d say don\u2019t rush for the hardback but wait for the paperback [as it\u2019s cheaper].A large majority of this plot focuses on events in 1999, with only a small focus of the aftermath (2011 and 2015) \u2013 I\u2019d have liked to see a bit more of an even split as it made the ending feel slightly rushed. I think my issue was, I didn\u2019t understand why so much of the plot was focused on the beginning when the synopsis I\u2019d read told me what happened so it felt like I was reading an unnecessarily long account of what I already knew. This then impacted my enjoyment as the suspense wasn\u2019t really there for me and nor was the mystery.I think it\u2019s fair to say, the synopsis I read on Goodreads (which hopefully has been changed now) spoiled this book for me, so I plead with you to read other reviews before dismissing this one.

Alleen het hondje van de buren volgt hem vrolijk als hij naar het bos gaat, waar hij een boomhut bouwt. Op een dag wordt het hondje overreden door een auto. De buurman maakt hem af met een geweer. Antoine is daar getuige van en het slaat bij hem in als een donderslag. Hij is niet meer dezelfde, iets in hem is gebroken. Als hij een beetje later de kleine R\u00e9my - het zoontje van de buurman - ziet, zijn de stoppen doorgeslagen: uit woede slaat hij de kleine jongen dood.

Three Days and a Life may only be a short book at two hundred and fifty pages, but over those pages we are given an engrossing read with a wonderful setting in rural France.Beauval is like any other rural French village, excitement is watching the bacon slicer in action, everybody knows each other\u2019s business there are no secrets or chance to keep secrets in the village. Even more so when a child goes missing just before Christmas.It is 1999 just before the turn of the millennium and Antoine is twelve years old and is idolised by Remi his six-year-old neighbour. He lives in Beauval with his divorced mother and his father he rarely sees is in Germany and tends to send him inappropriate presents. Antoine is upset when his next-door neighbour\u2019s dog is run over and then he shoots him to put him out of his pain, but this has a deep effect on him. To make matters worse Antoine has an incident with Remi, where he accidently kills him (no spoiler as this happens v early in the book) and hides his body.When people start looking for the lost Remi Antoine keeps a low profile, even though he never stops thinking about his friend. As the years slip by Antoine struggles with his actions in 1999 and is afraid that his past will eventually catch up with him. As he struggles with this, he cannot decide if it is time for him to leave Beauval as the small village is suffocating him. Has he time to leave or will his secret finally come out?Lemaitre has crafted a wonderful suspense thriller, showing why he is a French master of noir, as you know the twists are coming, you just cannot see them. As the book reaches its crescendo you still sympathise with Antoine, even though you know what he has done.

Panicked, he conceals the body and to his relief--and ongoing shame--he is never suspected of any connection to her disappearance.More than a decade later, Antoine is living in Paris, now a young doctor with a promising future. On a rare trip home, he sleeps with a beautiful young woman, who then shows up pregnant at his doorstep in Paris a few months later.
