This man is honest and very introspected. He thinks as an over thinker, but with poise because of his roots in Christ. He acknowledges doubts and encourages to fight through it. Amazing book!

A book that is so brilliant that I'm finally posting a written review for the first time. One of those books that I know I will keep coming back to time and time again. John White writes in such an honest, personal, and non-sugar-coated way. Learnt so much from this book... filled with great reminders and also new perspectives on my faith. Found the chapter 'Deliverance from Drudgery' particularly liberating. Completely changed my mindset on what it means to be a student, studying for exams, work, and success."}, {"userName": "Jack Bingham", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33902993-jack-bingham", "userReview": "The Fight really helped to free me up and remind me of basic, encouraging truths. I think everyone who loves Jesus should take an interest in this book and the way White addresses a broad range of difficult subjects and questions. Just a few:How do you effectively study the word? What is faith - really? Why is fellowship necessary? How do you 'fight the good fight'? How do you stay real? How does the Holy Spirit guide us - in real, practical terms?And most importantly of all, what does a life that's pleasing to God actually look like?"}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3488341-andrew", "userReview": "This book is awesome. John White is really wise and he knows what he is talking about. Each chapter is about a practical topic, so the book never gets boring. It goes over the Word, prayer, fellowship, warfare, evangelism, faith, and sanctification. What I like the most his how passionate White is about the topics. Even if you think you know all the basics, you'll get a lot out of this book."}, {"userName": "Francis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283264-francis", "userReview": "Very practical, without fluffy, trite sayings that don't really \"work\" in reality. Since White was also a psychiatrist, he is realistic, yet (I think) inspired, about his directives in the Christian life. Challenging, too."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2164319-sarah", "userReview": "I'm done being someone I'm not."}, {"userName": "Jim Haw", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10840354-jim-haw", "userReview": "Want to develop classic spiritual disciplines in your life?
