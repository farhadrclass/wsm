It is a stunning debut from Jess Kidd that draws the reader into what is a spellbinding read. A dark fairytale brimming with folklore, humour and flawless comic touches. For me, it called to mind the talented Kevin Barry and other Irish writers, past and present. The past gives us Orla's story and the present in the 1970s focuses on Mahony, her son. It begins with the murder of teenage single mum, Orla, and when the murderer looks to kill her baby, plants and nature have grown to magically protect the child.Now in his twenties, Mahony rides into Mulderrig, County Mayo, armed with a letter and a photograph he has just received to find out what happened to his mammy. Mahony is scruffy, has a devil may care smile that floors every woman he encounters and oozes charm. Everywhere he goes, the ghosts of the dead, human and animal, tumble out all around him, on occasion to help him. Despite resistance from a village that harbours lies, secrets and a murderer, he is implacable in his determination to discover what happened to his mother. He finds himself allied to and protected by a trio of Irish women you would not want to mess with. Mrs Cauley, a strong, yet frail and elderly actress with a magical library who insists on investigating Orla's death, has no qualms about shaking things in the village to see what falls out and is not afraid of the danger that lurks. Shaunna is Mahony's landlady who falls in love with Mahony and will let harm befall him only over her dead body. Bridget was a friend of Orla's, and uses her knowledge and gifts to help Mahony. Mrs Cauley directs J M Synge's The Playboy of the Western World with Mahony as the lead to conduct the investigation which sends the village into uproar. With poisoned scones, letter bombs, a hypocritical, cunning and loathsome priest, the judgemental evil Widow Farrelly, further murders, Mahony and his cohorts find themselves in danger. We find out Orla was a wayward, poverty stricken, promiscuous girl who also had the gift of seeing ghosts who passed on secrets that horrified the villagers. This made her a reviled figure, the truth was an evil not to be countenanced. To top it all, she had a child out of wedlock. The stench of hypocrisy is overwhelming. We have a supernatural storm that brings out rats, bats, spiders and badgers as an aid to the search for Orla's body. The truth finally emerges. Mahony who sees every ghost in town finds that the ghost of his mother eludes him until the end when he does see her.This is a beautifully imagined novel. The writing is poetic, lyrical, artistic and sublime. The characters are rich, diverse, quixotic, eccentric, and undeniably Irish. The story is seamless, complex, endearing and funny. What more could I ask for? An exceptional and talented writer. A literary triumph. Thanks to Canongate for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Amalia Gavea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56789747-amalia-gavea", "userReview": "''The dead are like cats, Mahony. You of all people should know that. They don't always come when they're called.''\nI added Jess Kidd's book when I first saw its deliciously creepy front cover and the striking title. It had all the right ingredients: Ireland during the 70s, magical realism, dry humour, gothic hints. When the lovely Goodreads Ireland group members chose it for our quarterly read, it was a perfect opportunity for me to start reading. Plus, it came highly recommended by my good friend Maria n\u00ed Chnoic so what more could I ask? And I can tell you it has been a wonderful trip with an exciting book!\n''Here is a handsome stranger.''\nMahony arrives in Mulderrig in 1976, searching for answers about his parentage, about the disappearance of his mother, seeking justice from the members of the community. He is clever, extremely charismatic, attractive, aloof and a torchured soul himself. (...and can you tell I fell in love with him immediately?) However,he has some demons of his own to fight and, at the same time, a number of significant allies. It was the nature of these allies that made me think I was reading a unique kind of book. ''For the dead are drawn to those with shattered souls.''Mahony is a shuttered soul, no matter how hard he tries to hide it, Orla was a shuttered soul, Shauna is troubled too. There is this large majority of the people in Mulderring whose lives have been plagued by secrets, sins, hatred and dogmatism. The dead demand justice for crimes committed by people with shady lives and motives. At the heart of this story lies an institution that is supposed to provide comfort and shelter to those in trouble: the Church.The ominous figure of the village priest is a recurring theme in British and Irish Fiction. The priest gives sermons about the dangers of superstitions and speaks against ''the wind of change coming from the cities.'' It is merely the favourite hobby of many members of the clergy who fear progress and the traditions of the ''pagan'' past alike. He considers Theatre a pagan notion of corruption and disruption and tries to build up his defenses when he understands that Orla has returned for retribution in the face of Mahony.The characters in Himself jump right from the page, both the ''good'' and the ''bad''. They are realistic depictions of a closely knit society who punishes those who wish to break free from suffocating beliefs and stereotypes. Mahony is easily one of the most fascinating characters I've ''met'' recently (I confess I am totally and absolutely biased and I regret nothing. The fact that Kidd's description of him reminds me slightly of my boyfriend doesn't help...) but for me, the real ''star'' of the story is Mrs. Cauley. My God, I loved her! She is a wonderful character, saucy and sassy and unashamed to put everyone in their place. I liked Shauna too. She is a calm, level-headed, tender soul. On the other hand, I hated R\u00f3is\u00edn, she disgusted me to no end...There is a great danger of revealing spoilers with this novel. It is a book that flows. Short chapters and interactions pass by like a flash and make the story move so quickly, you need to pay your fullest attention in order to absorb everything that is going on. The language is simple, but beautiful, it makes you search under the layers to look for motives and answers. There are elements of black humour that are able to make you laugh out loud in a story that blends Crime Fiction and Paranormal Mystery in a brilliant way. Kidd has created some memorable scenes throughout the narration. The introduction of Ida and a nightly storm that brought the Ten Biblical Plagues in mind are particularly powerful moments.I loved this book. I loved it as an example of Historical Fiction, of Mystery, of Crime, you name it. It is unique, beautiful and one more addition to all those fascinating books that we have the pleasure to read nowadays.\n''The night is clear from mountain to sea as Mahony climbs the dark ribbon of road. Ahead of him the starlit forest slumbers. Behind him the moonlight skims and breaks over the mild-skinned water of the bay, which is as still as milk tonight. For the wind is lying low, curled into the strong back of the deep-sleeping velvet mountain.''\n If that isn't Ireland in a paragraph, I don't know what is...."}, {"userName": "Kevin Ansbro", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43579369-kevin-ansbro", "userReview": "[ Annie Farrell, the Black Widow, is attempting to smother Mrs Cauley with a pillow, when she is assailed by flying novels from the old lady's magical library.

Here the colors are a little bit brighter and the sky is a little bit wider. Here the trees are as old as the mountains and a clear river runs into the sea. People are born to live and stay and die here. They don't want to go. Why would they when all the roads that lead to Mulderrig are downhill so that leaving is uphill all the way?\"Mulderrig is a small Irish village, a Brigadoon of sorts. One spring day in 1976, Mahony arrives in Mulderrig from Dublin, where he has lived all of his life. Or most of his life. Because just recently, he found out that one of his chief nemeses at the orphanage where he was raised, Sister Veronica, left him an envelope when she died. And in this envelope was news which changed his life: a picture of him as an infant with his mother, telling him his real name, and that he is from Mulderrig. The note also said that his mother was \"the curse of the town,\" so they took him from her.For Mahony, who has always been a bit of a rake (yet a handsome one) and a ne'er-do-well, this is powerful stuff. He had believed his mother had abandoned him, but he couldn't understand why, or why she never searched for him. So he heads to Mulderrig to try and uncover the truth about what happened to her 26 years ago.\"He has always believed two things, that his mother was dead and that he had known her. In order to feel her loss he must have known her presence. And he does feel her loss, he always has. Which is why he has been searching for her all his life: because he had loved her and because he had lost her. He'd searched but she'd never answered.\"Mahony's return creates quite a stir in Mulderrig for a number of reasons. His physical appearance (even though he's a bit of an unwashed hippie-type) and his newness appeal to women of all ages, who react in unusual ways. His similarities to his mother quickly raise the ire, suspicion, and guilt of those residents who knew her, and might have had a hand in her circumstances. Oh, and his return has also raised the dead, many of whom were alive or around 26 years ago, and only a few people in town, including Mahony, can see and communicate with them.Teaming up with Mrs. Cauley, an eccentric former theater actress who likes nothing more than to stir up trouble among Mulderrig's residents, Mahony is determined to uncover the truth about his mother. The two concoct a plan to interrogate those who might know something, and hopefully flush out the truth, with the help of some of the town's colorful residents. But this scandal ran far and wide through Mulderrig, and the two might be putting themselves and those they care about in danger as they get closer and closer to the truth.This is such a charming, magical book, and as quirky as it is, it's quite emotionally moving as well, as it explores the ideas of loss and grief, of a girl trying to rise above circumstances she has been handed although everyone wants to fight her at every turn, and the rejuvenating power of friendship. I know that at its heart, this book is a mystery, but I could have done without its brief foray into actual crime novel territory, even though I understood the point, in showing that even lovely towns like Mulderrig have these types of secrets which many want to remain hidden.While Jess Kidd spent so much time creating the \"good\" characters, and they are so tremendously appealing, some of the \"bad\" characters don't get the same attention, so they feel a little more like stereotypical characters than fully realized. But the beauty of Kidd's storytelling, and the warmth of this book is wonderful, reminding me a bit of those quirky Irish movies like \nWaking Ned Devine\n. (In tone, not subject matter.) This is a book which would be absolutely terrific as a movie because there is so much your mind's eye pictures, and it would be great to see that portrayed on screen.If you're looking for a book with a little bit of charm and whimsy along with its terrific story, pick up Jess Kidd's \nHimself\n. In a literary world of copycats, this feels pretty original in many ways.NetGalley and Atria Books provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

Mahoney, raised in an orphanage, come to Murdering to uncover the truth about the young mother he never knew. He creates quite a stir with his Byronic good looks, sets hearts a quivering, but not all because many in this place are holding secrets and one is a murderer. He meets some amazing characters, willing to help him with his quest: the old Mrs., Cauley, who was quite a stage sensation in her youth and still has vestiges of her bold character, Bridget Doosey, who has talents that are unseen, and the intrepid Shauna, a young women who falls hard to Mahoney.Magical realism, humor, the paranormal all combine in this enchanting story. Mahoney has an unforeseen talent, like his mother before him, he can see and talk to ghosts, and his return stirs all the town's residents, living and dead. So much humor, I laughed continuously, smiled often. Mrs. Cauley owes a debt of gratitude to Jane Austen's Collected Works, War and Peace and a few other large tomes, after all books do save lives. There is one part of only a few paragraphs that is quite unsavory, concerning a dog and some violence because as I said there is a murderer about and he is bent at not having his secret uncovered.More plot oriented than Lincoln in the Bardo, but if you enjoyed that one you will probably love this one."}, {"userName": "Susanne Strong", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne-strong", "userReview": "5 Stars.Bewitching, Mysterious and Whimsical. \u201cHimself\u201d by Jess is a spellbinding fairytale that intertwines the magical with the supernatural. Its dark whimsy draws you in with its brilliance.Mahoney returns to Mulderrig, on Ireland\u2019s coast, as it\u2019s the place of his birth. He was raised in an orphanage in Dublin and never knew his mother, having always thought he was abandoned. As a young adult, he is given a photograph of his mother and him and discovers that he wasn\u2019t abandoned after all and thus sets out to Mulderrig to search for answers. There he finds more than he bargained for.For Mulderrig is a place where secrets run amok and stay hidden forever. And the town folks? They are friendly to newcomers - that is, until they realize who Mahoney is and what he is after. Yet Mahoney is a charmer, swoon-worthy even. The smile, the scruffiness, the charm. And he has a gift. He can see and speak to ghosts of the past, some of whom are happy to help with his plight, while others are simply afraid of him.When investigating what happened to his mother, Orla, Mahoney also gets help from some pretty incredible friends: Ms. Cauley, the quirky theatre performer who is wildly entertaining and full of ideas as to how to help Mahoney; Bridget Doosey, a woman who knew his mother and has gifts of her own; and Shauna, Mahoney\u2019s, landlady who will do anything to protect him. These women are instrumental in his finding the truth. Set in the 1950\u2019s and the 1970\u2019s, Himself is a fairytale of folklore. It\u2019s endearing, dark, beguiling, and utterly charming to no end. In truth, it is not the type of book I would normally read. Whimsy, fantastical is not my style - but I must say this: it pulls the reader in from the first sentence. You can\u2019t tear your eyes away. The prose is absolutely flawless, beautiful even. The characters are lovely, comical & ensnaring. In short, this novel is not to be missed. With \u201cHimself,\u201d Jess Kidd bewitches the reader. I, for one, am glad I fell under his spell. I hope you will consider doing the same.A big thank you to my GR friend Larry for his fantastic review of Himself - which is what convinced me to read this book in the first place. Your review was stellar! :)Thank you to NetGalley, Atria Books and Jess Kidd for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.Published on NetGalley, Goodreads and Amazon on 4/16/17."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "\u201dMulderrig is a place like no other.

Why would they when all the roads that lead to Mulderrig are downhill so that leaving is uphill all the way?\u201dMahoney returns to Mulderrig, although he has no memory of being there, it was in Mulderrig he was born. Raised in a Dublin orphanage, he never knew his mother, has no memory of her or of family, or even of this place.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t have known it but it was then that her baby stopped crying. The void her son had fallen into without the cradle of her gaze was immeasurable. He lay as mute as a little mushroom.\u201dHe\u2019s an adult now, old enough to search for her, for the reasons why she abandoned him. Who, and where he comes from. At first Mahoney\u2019s presence goes mostly unnoticed by the mortal members of town, but Mahoney is aware of those beyond the realm who hover around him, teasing him with their presence. Their eyes tell so much, and nothing at all at the same time. \u201dFor the dead are drawn to those with shattered souls\u201d.He is aware of the others, can see them, but he can\u2019t see her. His mother. Orla Sweeney. He has a photograph of her, where she\u2019s holding him as an infant, given to him as he was leaving the Orphanage. Sister Veronica had left him an envelope, his real name, and the town of his birth: Mulderrig. He knows from the note that he was taken from his mother, by unknown townspeople, because his mother was \u201cthe curse of the town.\u201d \u201dHis dark eyes are her eyes, the shape of his face, hers. The way he stands with his weight shifted back on his heels and his nose in the air, hers.\u201dAnd so, Mahoney arrives in Mulderrig in search of himself. Jess Kidd shares her story in writing that is lovely, inspired, ingenious, and quintessentially Irish in the colloquial expressions. The mysterious mystical setting revealed with enough cleverness and wit to keep the heebie-jeebies at bay. Her characters are complex, including the intimidating local priest to Mrs. Cauley, a rather unconventional, wealthy, former theatre actress who is not afraid of much, and who takes Mahoney a bit under her wing. The hairs at the back of my neck stood up often, but perhaps most often at the splendor of her prose. Still there is an element that many would consider supernatural. Creepy, even. \u201dIt is a truth universally acknowledged that when the dead are trying to remember something, the living are trying harder to forget it.Magical, moving, magnificent debut novel from Jess Kidd. I loved \u201dHimself\u201d, a uniquely beautiful blend of genres, a tale of love and loss, grief, and of secrets kept too long.

I think I will put it next to Lincoln in the Bardo because the ghosts inside their pages have so much in common, and because both books just struck a chord in me and made for such great reading.In Himself we meet Mahoney, 26 years old, charismatic, very good looking and able to charm even ghosts with just a wink. What he does to the female population of Mulderrig, a small town in County Mayo Ireland, is amazing:) I am pretty sure he has charmed many of the readers of this book, including me.Jess Kidd writes good characters altogether. Mrs Cauley is just wonderful and practically drives the whole book. The ghosts are good too, Johnnie with his unfortunate antics, Ida the small girl who tries to help, Miss Mulhearne who gets Mahoney to read her poetry and many others.This is certainly a book of many genres.

You see, Mahony, was born in this town but was raised in an orphanage. While living in Dublin, he recently learned that his mother disappeared in this town. The town folk think he's a gobshite. Well, just the men. The women think he's dreamy, handsome with dark eyes and long hair, in need of a bath. Let's just say when he arrives, all h*ll breaks loose.Most of the town do not want him here. Especially when they find out who his mother is, Orla. Orla was a bad girl in town and they wanted to get rid of her. Any way they could. Mahony just wants to find her or find out what happened to her. Orla had a special gift, she could talk to the dead. And the dead really had something to say about those in town. Which made them even more mad at her. Now, Mahony returns, bringing up the past, having that same special skill, he can talk to the dead. Along the way, he does have the help of three special women in town, and one is quite the spitfire. Oh Mrs. Cauley, how she goes toe-to-toe with the local priest is just priceless.What a wonderful, magical story this one was. Early on I saw a few reviews by GR friends and was immediately enchanted. Bring on the addition of ghosts to the story, a thoroughly enjoyable read that had me laughing out loud at times. It's dark, violent, funny, with touches of magical realism. To me, the stars of this book were the ghosts. They added such humour to the story. Especially since they had this thing...forgetfulness....that really helped with the story. There are some wonderful characters in this one. But the issue I had (hence only 4 stars) the bad characters were not fully developed. I wanted to know why they did what they did. Some of the final story is a bit open too. (Oh, and there was an especially horrible scene with a dog, why?!?!?!?) I loved a different area for reading, Ireland, and learning a bunch of slang.

The two don\u2019t share much else in common, but honestly, the charm of Irish writing is more than enough to keep me paying attention.And Kidd definitely knows how to tell a story.I thought this novel had all the things I like in a book such as Irish folklore, a mystery to solve, and ghosts of both people and pets. The Irish setting is original and alive with exceptionally skillful writing, with gems of phrasing on every page. So what went wrong? As it's often happens with great story, stupid characters doing stupid shit. Like can we not have a male MC who is so \u201chandsome\u201d and so \u201cflawless\u201d that women of all ages ranging from 14 year old to 60 are ready to become his sex slave without actually giving any real insight as to what makes him so special? Also can we not have female characters whose sole purpose in the story is to pine over a dude who has no interest over her whatsoever? Lastly, my biggest concern was combination of the lyricism and magic realism that too frequently tip over into Irish whimsy.

Mulderring is a town simmering with fiercely kept secrets, quite a few miscreants and a chorus of ghosts that lurk at every corner and crevice.At times suffering from a little too much of everything: so many deaths, even more characters and shape shifting genres--crime thriller, spirited farce, paranormal forces--it is the writing that had these non-Irish eyes smiling and more than once laughing. One of the characters has \u2018the appearance of a benign geriatric spider,\u2019 while another laments that \u2018a decent woman would be slower to court; the higher the mind the trickier the knickers.\u2019 There were so many passages of note, but it is in the moments of thought made imagery where I found myself in awe.\u2026an unwanted memory shifting in the back of her mind. Past the place where old songs go to pass the time of day with forgotten hymns and nursery rhymes. Where long-ago cats are put out along with lost schooldays and expired coupons\u2026but right now this memory is jumbled deep, tucked firmly behind the shopping lists and the ironing, the Friday fish and Monday-morning gossiping.This author\u2019s imagination is fertile soil where a priest\u2019s dwelling develops a holy spring replete with a contagion of frogs, soot suddenly permeates a town and for book lovers the most delicious enemy attack you may ever savor. All of this and more awaits in this debut novel and were it not for the overabundance factor, I would give this the full five.

Unfortunately for him, the only ghost he really wants to see (his mother's), eludes him. Ghosts in this book are like cats - they don't come when they're called. They aren't particularly helpful. They don't uncover crucial clues or whisper murderers\u2019 names, though their presence is integral to the book.It's 1976. Mahoney, in his tight leather bell-bottoms, has returned to the town of Mulderrig. He\u2019s determined to find out once and for all, what happened to his mother, Orla, who disappeared in 1950 when he was just a baby. He's met with an inordinate amount of resistance from the villagers. Each of them, it seems, has something to hide, and none of them want him around. He finds an ally in the elderly diva Mrs. Cauley, who takes up his cause. She's a former actress who puts on the church's annual fundraising play. She makes Mahoney the star of the show while the two of them sleuth around. Kidd likens her to Miss Marple, a Miss Marple who cusses and drinks with special Irish flair.The story starts off so well. This is Jess Kidd's first novel and there is some truly fine writing here. It's often lyrical verging on the poetic, building tension and cadence with repeated refrains. I also enjoyed the whole superstitious Irish village thing she has going on, even if it\u2019s teetering on the edge of cliche. It\u2019s pretty humorous at times. And, I quite enjoyed the slithery character of Father Quinn. BUT... as I went along, I noticed problematic elements that lessened my enjoyment:* - I had a really tough time believing every female in the town of Mulderrig found Mahoney so irresistible. I got kind of tired hearing about how ridiculously good looking he was.* - He has a love affair that is pretty pointless to the plot, other than to show us yet again how studly he is... yawn. * - The main romantic relationship isn\u2019t very believable. Kidd doesn\u2019t really show what either of them see in one another. It seemed like the author was just trying to fit in the \"romance\" jigsaw piece, just for the sake of it.* - There\u2019s a hideous dog-murder, which felt like a gratuitous assault. It was a lazy way of showing us the psychopathy of one of the characters, by having them brutally kill a lovely and loyal-to-the-end animal.The story went on a bit too long, and there were a lot of characters to keep track of, and a few loose ends that never get resolved. But I still followed with interest, to the end. I did want to find out what happened to Orla. I wanted Mahoney to connect with her, as a ghost or otherwise. I wanted so much. But the ending is messy, and kind of disappointing. Especially the very end. Just when you think you know what's what, Kidd chucks in a bit of uncertainty. Why? To leave it open for a sequel? Miss Marple would never do that.This is an ambitious and enjoyable debut by Jess Kidd. I applaud her for bringing her musical prose to the mystery genre and look forward to seeing what she writes next.3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Book of Secrets", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3453249-book-of-secrets", "userReview": "HIMSELF is one of the most unusual mysteries I've read; the experience was like getting pulled into a vivid 20th century Irish folk tale. Set in the small village of Mulderrig, this wild story alternates between the 1970s and 1940s/50s. Mahony grew up in a Dublin orphanage, with very few clues about his beginning. When he finally gets a lead, 26-year old Mahony travels back to Mulderrig determined to find out what became of this mother, stirring up all kind of chaos in the process. The book is full of quirky, funny, tragic characters, both living and dead. Mahony can communicate with the dead, sometimes they're helpful, other times not so much.

Such a delightful, charming and magical book, a brilliant debut, hard to believe this is Jess Kidd\u2019s first book. Set mainly in the mid-1970s, the main character Mahoney returns to Mulderrig, a small town on the west coast of Ireland, determined to find out what happened to his teenage mother Orla who abandoned him as a baby. The characters, both living and dead, are brought to \u2018life\u2019 so vividly and skilfully. I loved old Merle Cauley (Mrs Cauley), the cynical, straight-shooting, witty ex-actor who puts on her final village play and takes a shining to Mahoney and wants to help him solve the mystery of his mother\u2019s disappearance.Mahoney\u2019s mother Orla first realised she could communicate with the dead when she was a young girl and I love this scene in 1944 in the confessional when, as a 10yo girl, she first tells the local priest about it\u2026The confessional in St Patrick\u2019s church had always lapped up tales of suffering and spite. It fed on shame and remorse with quiet, ligneous devotion. Its deep shine was not just wood polish and spinster\u2019s spittle; it was the gilding of guilt, rubbed over the years to a saintly lustre.Inside, on one side of the brass lattice, sat Father Jim Hennessy, full of hard-won wisdom and indigestion. On the other side of the brass lattice sat Orla Sweeney, eyes wide in the dark.She pressed her fingers into the grill until the tips of them disappeared. She could hear the priest breathing on the other side.\u2018I talk to the dead, Father,\u2019 she said. They\u2019ve been giving me messages since last Tuesday.\u2019Father Jim was trying to release gas quietly. For he was a big-framed strong man more suited to the rigours of farming than the sedentary life of the cloth; his spiritual calling had all but destroyed his digestion. He carefully raised one cheek but it reverberated on the wooden bench. He apologised to the Lord and straightened his stole.\u2018Child, this a terrible fantasy to put into your head and it is false. You must look to the Lord God to find truth and peace in your life.\u2019\u2018I know it\u2019s wrong to talk to them, Father, but they\u2019re so lonely. At first there was only a few but now they keep coming up out of the ground and through the walls with all these things they want telling to people and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019Father Jim learnt two things that day. First, that quantities of radishes did not agree with him and second:\u2018Dorothy says it wasn\u2019t your fault, Father.\u2019Father Jim\u2019s breath halted inside him.\u2018She says she would have died anyway, even if you hadn\u2019t tried to baptise her in the cowshed. It wasn\u2019t the chill that took her away; it was her heart.\u2019Father Jim went as white as a sheet in the dark. He was where? In the confessional, trying to keep breathing.Breathing what? The familiar incense smell, beeswax and lilies, the damp wool coats of the congregation, their balsam and hair ointment, their stale smoke and cough sweets, the vinegar of last night\u2019s alcohol.But he was half in the past again. A child of little more than six, already with a vocation, practising the priesthood and knowing it was wrong, but wanting to. Oh wanting to, wanting to do his great loving terrible God\u2019s work always, always.There was his new baby sister with her face still wrinkled with brine, and there was the cup dipped again and again into the bucket in the cowshed. The low winter sun filled his eyes to the brim, spilling all around, catching cup and bucket. He remembered still the bright metal glint and the light burnishing the straw to gold and the cobbled mud to bronze.He had baptised her Dorothy, although her name was Margaret. He drew a cross on her tiny forehead and blessed her blissfully, whispering the words like a spell.Mammy couldn\u2019t understand why Babby was wet in the cradle. All her things soaked. She wasn\u2019t to know it was holy water, for the cows were in the milking shed now and the bucket was no longer a font lit by God in heaven.And Dorothy? A livid spot on each cheek, otherwise a china doll.A coffin small enough for Mammy to hold on her knees.God bless, Dorothy.The real priest was solid black; Jimmy watched from under the table with his little soul frozen with a terror that had never quite thawed.Until he was absolved by a ten-year-old girl.Father Jim stumbled from the confessional and shut himself in the sacristy. He looked around the familiar room. At the press with his vestments inside and the baptismal candles that lay waxy in a row. At the bottles of Communion wine and the linen, reverently folded, a mystery of worn fabric and belief. The whiskey in his hand didn\u2019t warm. The shelves of books didn\u2019t reassure.This was the first time that Orla made Father Jim Hennessy cry.Mahoney has his mother\u2019s gift of seeing and speaking with the dead and in 1976 we\u2019re in Mrs Cauley\u2019s room where she and Mahoney are discussing their next strategy. Father Jim, deceased some 26 years ago, appears in the room and Mrs Cauley implores Mahoney to get some information about Orla\u2019s disappearance from him. \u2018Tell her she\u2019s an eejit\u2019 says Father Jim to Mahoney.Mahoney tries to explain to Mrs Cauley that it\u2019s not straightforward getting information from the dead\u2026.'It\u2019s just that they don\u2019t always have great memories. They\u2019re a little lost.\u2019Mrs Cauley purses her lips. \u2018So Father Jim, sitting scratching his bollocks on the commode there, is of no use to us?\u2019Mahoney shrugs. How can he explain? How can he explain to Mrs Cauley that Father Jim is just a vague copy of his former living self? That just like any other dead person, his mind, if you can call it a mind, has ceased to exist. For the dead don\u2019t change and grow. They\u2019re just echoes of the stories of their own lives sung back in the wrong order: arsewards. They\u2019re the pattern on closed eyelids after you turn away from a bright object. They\u2019re twice exposed film. They\u2019re not really here, so cause and effect means nothing to them.I don\u2019t often read books twice but I reckon I will read this one again. It\u2019s packed full of brilliant writing and dialogue and I\u2019d like to savour it again.

It's a literary mystery, small town social satire and dark comedy with beautiful language (read with a variety of captivating voices by Aiden Kelly, the narrator of the audiobook).The prologue is set in Mulderrig, Ireland in 1950 and describes the murder of 16 year old Orla Sweeney while her infant son cries nearby. The baby winds up in a Dublin orphanage. In 1976, 26 year old Mahony returns to Mulderrig with a photo of his mother to find out what happened to her. Mahony is handsome, charming and very attractive to women. Nevertheless, the citizens of Mulderrig are not happy to see his return. Orla had been wild and a troublemaker and everyone had been relieved when she and her baby disappeared. His arrival leads to an outburst of superstition, threats, bribery and murder.Mahony rents a room in the same house as the retired actress Mrs. Merle Cauley. Mahony and Cauley conclude that his mother must have been murdered and begin to investigate, starting with the interviewing everyone who shows up for auditions for the annual amateur play. The two have a similar way of cutting through bullshit and pretension and make an entertaining team. Also, this book has lots and lots of ghosts. They are everywhere and Mahony and Ora share the ability to see them. However ghosts are dangerous because they don't lie and they reveal truths about the past that most people would rather keep hidden. Unfortunately, Mahony can't just ask his mother for the name of her murderer. \"The dead are like cats, Mahony. You of all people should know that.

The heatwave has stretched, exhaled and picked itself up off the town all in one afternoon. And the rain has returned. At first it fell lightly, uncertainly, as if it were testing itself, on the curious noses of cats and cows turned upwards to see if this news of rain was really true. But the tress knew, and so did the bees, for they know all things. Soon the rain grew confident, pattering on cobbles, bouncing along the tractor track carved in the hard-baked ground. Then heavy and certain in its benediction, the rain began to fall steadily, blissfully, unlocking the smell of the ground\nThe book is set in a village in County Mayo in the interminable Summer of 1976, although the short chapters occasionally range back to a period 25 years or so earlier. Mahony, a good looking, scruffy but charming Dublin based petty criminal arrives in the village and stays in the only guest house. He quickly reveals that the reason for his visit is a photo passed on to him following the death of a nun at the orphanage, of a girl and her baby and a note.\nYour name is Francis Sweeney. Your Mamma was Orla Sweeney. You are from Mulderrig, County Mayo. This is a picture of yourself and her. For your information she was the curse of the town, so they took her from you. They all lie, so watch yourself and know that your Mammy loved you.\nHe quickly discovers that Orla was a local rebel, living with her parents in a hovel on the edge of a forest, sleeping with most of the men in the village, apparently possessed by some ability to communicate with the dead (who possess her to write notes in their own handwriting) revealing village secrets and who when she became pregnant refused to give up the child or accept a marriage of inconvenience. What everyone admits is that, particularly when the old priest who had protected her dies and a new priest arrives keener to ingratiate himself in the village, is that she and her child were run out of town. What no one admits but is clear to us from the first chapter and accepted by Mahony early on, is that she was murdered. The ostensible plot of the book is the attempt by Mahony to find out what really happened, aided by Merle a now dying actress living in the same poor guest house as Mahony, who uses her annual fund raising production of a play (in this case The Playboy of the Western World by J.M. Synge whom she claims to have known) as a way to facilitate the investigation. A lively array of other characters either assist (for example Mahony\u2019s young landlady and sometime lover, the quirky housekeeper of the priest), hinder (the weasel-like village priest and a formidable widower) or observe (the local Garda officer) Mahony\u2019s quest \u2013 the key factor being if they wish to preserve the timelessness of the village and bury the past or uncover the past and shake up the present. He is also surrounded by the dead of the area (who he observes as ghostly presences at all times), in particular a young girl Ida who seems to have seen the murdered (and possibly been killed as a result). As time progresses the book moves from the mundane to the fantastical including for example a supernatural magnetism which attracts all the wedding rings in the village (and assorted other metals) to the murder Island, and a fantastical well and spring which open up in the vicarage, seemingly as punishment for the Priest preaching against the rise in superstition in the village.This is Kidd\u2019s debut novel and on this showing she is clearly a very talented novelist, capable not just of writing great prose but with abilities across a range of different genres, both slightly derivative: crime fiction (think Kate Atkinson Jackson Brodie), rollicking and foul-mouthed black Irish comedy (think The Glorious Heresies but in pre-Celtic Tiger rather than post Celtic Tiger Ireland), supernatural/horror thrillers, literary tribute (J.M. Synge\u2019s play is not just restaged but actually in some cases mirrored in the novel\u2019s plot in the same way as Hag-Seed) ; but also inventively original. In particular she derives a uniquely Irish twist on magic realism (with the ghosts being equally as valid as key protagonists as the living, and with Irish folk and Catholic influenced superstition, being as legitimate as science and logic in terms of plot development). The issue with this novel (and one that can be common in first novels) is that Kidd tries to cram all of these into one novel alongside an array of slightly over the top characters and an array of plot twists or side stories which seemingly are as bewildering to her as the reader, as many are simply left only half-formed or unresolved.\nBridget nods \u201cThis storm will unearth Orla Sweeney.

Still, I thought I'd give it a shot and hope my love of Irish lit would prevail. Instead I think my dislike of magical realism won out.Here's what I don't like about this genre. (I realize this is a blanket statement and that there are exceptions - I can even think of some myself. But, just talking generally.) I feel like a lot of magical realism arbitrarily includes magical or supernatural elements to force a certain tone or atmosphere onto the story, but rather than being integrated into the framework of the narrative, these elements feel more like awkward accessories.What I mean is: in Himself, the main character, Mahoney, sees dead people. There are ghosts on almost every page of this book, and there's an air of mysticism about the fictional town of Mulderrig. Consequently, I want to call this book 'creepy' or 'eerie' or even 'whimsical,' but, was it really any of those things? It was sort of a hollow story. Mahoney, orphaned from a young age, returns to his hometown at the age of 26 to find out the truth of what happened to his mother. A lot of tedium and forgettable characters ensue, and the story lacked an engaging emotional core to draw you in. I just didn't care, and the ghosts didn't do it any favors, because they didn't really do anything - even the ones that I thought would play a larger role in the narrative ultimately did not - so I guess they're just there to make the book seem creepier than it actually is.So, why 3 stars? It's more like 2.5 rounded up, but, Jess Kidd's prose is stunning. This book was beautifully, brilliantly written, and when it's so clearly a case of 'it's not you, it's me,' I feel compelled to be generous in my rating. If you like mysteries and contemporary Irish lit as much as I do but you are kinder to magical realism, there's a good chance you'll love this. Maybe you'll get more out of the ghosts than I did."}], "description": "\u201cA highly unusual tale set in a highly unusual Irish village full of dark secrets\u2026Lushly imagined, delightfully original, and very, very funny, it hurtles along from the very first page\u201d (M.L. Stedman, author of The Light Between Oceans).Having been abandoned on the steps of an orphanage as an infant, lovable car thief and Dublin charmer Mahony assumed all his life that his mother had simply given him up. But when he receives an anonymous note suggesting that foul play may have led to his mother\u2019s disappearance, he sees only one option: to return to the rural Irish village where he was born and find out what really happened twenty-six years ago.From the moment he sets foot in Mulderrig, Mahony\u2019s presence turns the village upside down. His uncannily familiar face and outsider ways cause a stir among the locals, who receive him with a mixture of excitement (the women), curiosity (the men), and suspicion (the pious).Determined to uncover the truth about what happened to his mother, Mahony solicits the help of brash anarchist and retired theater actress Mrs. Cauley. This improbable duo concocts an ingenious plan to get the town talking about the day Mahony's mother disappeared and are aided and abetted by a cast of eccentric characters, both living and dead.Himself is a simmering mixture\u2014a blend of the natural everyday and the supernatural, folklore and mystery, and a healthy dose of quintessentially Irish humor. The result is a darkly comic crime story in the tradition of a classic Irish trickster tale, complete with a twisting and turning plot, a small-town rife with secrets, and an infectious love of language and storytelling that is a hallmark of the finest Irish writers.", "title": "Himself", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31935329-himself", "average": 3.94, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1473507815l/31935329.jpg", "reviews": 773, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15044123.Jess_Kidd", "name": "Jess Kidd"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Magical Realism", "Fantasy", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31935329-himself", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29365635-himself", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30900651-himself", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33023729-himself", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753697-himself", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35693301-himself", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36269325-the-hoarder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
