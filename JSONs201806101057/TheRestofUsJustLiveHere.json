Or possibly he hated it, but either way he paid enough attention to seemingly frame an entire book around the concept of \"The Chosen One\" and - specifically - Xander's quote from season 7:\n\n\"They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't chosen. To live so near to the spotlight and never step in it.\"\n\nThis is a book about the people in the background. The ones who aren't \"indie kids\" with names like Satchel and Finn. The ones who do not get chosen, never discover their secret powers, never fall in love with a vampire, and neither save nor destroy the world.Each chapter opens with a short synopsis on what the \"indie kids\" are doing. Whether they've opened a supernatural portal, been contacted by immortals, or died. From these small paragraphs emerges a humourous parody of \"The Chosen One\" genre, before the chapter continues on with the everyday lives, loves, anxieties and mental health of the not chosen.It's a clever and interesting concept, and yet I was more in love with the idea of it than the actual execution. If I wanted to sum this book up in a single sentence, I would say: Ness wrote a book about the boring, everyday kids and it was... kind of boring and everyday. I wish that wasn't the case, I really do. Especially because I generally love everything Ness writes. But, if I'm being honest, by far the strongest parts of this book were the small paragraphs at the start of each chapter.Not that the normal kids are without sensationalism - not at all. Their lives are filled with eating disorders, OCD, car crashes, absent parents and unrequited love. But, even though the book is well-written on a technical level, I did not find their stories very compelling, or the characters themselves particularly interesting. Ness has succeeded in writing a book about people who do not stand out at all. I'm already forgetting about them.I feel like credit should always be given where it's due, though, and I will say that Ness has written a fantastically diverse book, in all senses of \"diverse\". I applaud him for doing so. And I also applaud him for being one of the few YA authors to write sophisticated fiction that will make teenagers think and take them to places they can't get from the mainstream bestsellers.I will continue to be excited when I see Ness has an upcoming release, but this one didn't quite do it for me.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Jesse (JesseTheReader)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114361-jesse-jessethereader", "userReview": "I was a bit disappointed with this book.

With the lights.\"She shrugs. \"Probably some apocalypse.\"the problem with writing a book like More Than This is that you then have to write a book after More Than This. and i was a little apprehensive about this one. my copy has this cover:which makes it look almost like a middle grade book, and i was concerned that it wouldn't live up to the mind-shattering acrobatic metafiction that was More Than This.and it doesn't. nothing ever will.but that doesn't mean this isn't a great book all on its own. this book plays with the literary convention of the \"chosen one,\" - those who are set apart from their peers and tasked with a responsibility no less than that of saving the world. and they wrestle with this burden and forgo having a normal adolescent life because they are the only ones who can do what needs to be done and they fight evil and deputize their friends in the struggle and still manage to pass their math tests.this book is not about the chosen ones.this book is about the blurry kids in the background of the wide-angle shots - the ones who are just hurrying to class.it's about these people:\nthey attend the same school as the chosen ones, and they witness the horrors that seem to follow \"the indie kids*\" around, but they are uninvolved in their exploits, in their occasional demises. on the sidelines, all they can do is remark is that \"They better not blow up the high school again.\"the trials of the indie kids open each chapter, with a brief synopsis of what is going on in their struggle while the book itself is primarily concerned with bringing the blurry kids into the spotlight to show that, yeah, there's a portal of doom opening in the gymnasium, but other things are happening in what would ordinarily be the background, and those struggles are every bit as challenging as the ones centered around the portal. people have eating disorders, OCD, distant or absent parents, unrequited love, car accidents. and these things matter.\"Not everyone has to be the Chosen One. Not everyone has to be the guy who saves the world. Most people just have to live their lives the best they can, doing the things that are great for them, having great friends, trying to make their lives better, loving people properly. All the while knowing that the world makes no sense but trying to find a way to be happy anyway.\"it's a great blend of fantasy and contemporary fiction, as the separate storylines overlap and commingle: jealousy and zombie deer, the alzheimer's of a beloved grandmother and strange blue glows, bickering and bombs, prom and portals. there's a little cheating, since one of the \"normal\" kids is also a descendant of the goddess of cats and has a couple of powers of his own, but for the most part, the problems are familiar ones, and they are dealt with in mortal ways.being a long-time lover of cheesy teen horror movies, and having finally caved last year and watched buffy, there were plenty of nods, references, and allusions to the chosen one genre that i really appreciated, but i appreciated even more ness' little reversals.\"Now you're sure we're not going to be ritualistically murdered?\u2026Prom night.

Most people just have to live their lives the best they can.\u201d If there\u2019s a word that would best describe author, Patrick Ness, it would be \ningenious.\n True, the story may not have the most adventurous plot but the premise sure is brilliant and completely original. I have personally never thought about the side characters, the ordinary people watching Katniss and Peeta fight for their lives in the hellish arena\u2026...or the kid watching Spiderman fight the bully at the school hall. I doubt anyone has ever thought about them, like really thought of them until Patrick Ness.This creative story is inventively about a group of teenage non-heroes, the none \u201cIndie\u201d kids who try to just live their ordinary lives in a small town where zombies, soul eating ghosts and vampires are daily ordinary occurrences and where the Indie kids die off one after the other but which isn\u2019t a huge deal because the non-heroes are not really affected, unless they become one of the \u201ccasualties.\u201dAt first, I found the story kind of weird and confusing because of the unique structure with a small side story about the Indie kids at the start of each chapter, but not long after (when I finally got the hang of it), I started to really enjoy it because the writing is surprisingly easy and funny to read. The lack of action in the plot makes perfect sense because the focus of the story is the personal struggle of the individual characters who may not have been chosen as heroes but who are still heroes of their own lives. I was surprised at the amount of social issues that were effectively tackled in the novel despite the light and comic tone. I was also impressed at the fullness of the development of the characters despite the relatively few pages (for a sort of apocalyptic novel) and satisfied at the conclusion that would make this standalone contemporary/slight apocalyptic novel one of a kind. Lastly, I learned from the Author\u2019s Note that the author auctioned off the chance to have the winner\u2019s name in the book for a Red Cross fund raising project to help the countless victims of typhoon Haiyan that devastated the Philippines in 2013. :,) I think I officially love Patrick Ness now. <3Thanks to Will\u2019s excellent review that made me read the book.

Just my luck that Target would have autographed first editions of it:The basic premise of this book is that the main characters here are the background players in everything else. The funny thing is that this story, while YA, makes fun of YA tropes and bloated subgenres like vampires or demigods or immortals and kids \"dying beautifully of cancer\". That's the whole joke about this book is that it's poking fun at how airheaded YA culture can be sometimes, how teens can mindlessly go after the next big thing and turn it into a plague that destroys their brain cells while parents pretend it isn't happening.It's as if the camera were to pan away from Bella and Edward and start following Anna Kendrick and all of the other nobody characters (but without all of the tryhardness of IRL Anna Kendrick that gets really obnoxious). The Rest of Us Just Live Here is about the people who have to watch from the sidelines and are never part of the larger story, which is probably why this book is very popular: it speaks to all the people who weren't popular in school."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "\u201cWe're just as screwed up and brave and false and loyal and wrong and right as anyone else.\u201dA boy with the simple wish to finish school, and maybe even kiss the girl he's been in love with forever.

I love them and I was so excited about this book. I'm still excited - not only to revisit the story with a future re-read but for you guys to soon enjoy it when it officially hits shelves! Luckily it met my expectations and the more I think about it, the more I appreciate what Patrick Ness did with this book. Is it my new favourite by him? No, but it's very good! I find that descriptions of Patrick Ness' books rarely give them justice but think of a realistic novel with a Buffy episode backdrop. The beginning of each chapter briefly shows the reader what the Chosen One is up to, but we actually don't follow their story. What were the other pupils of Sunnydale up to while Buffy and the Scooby Gang were saving the world? What about other Hogwarts students? This is Patrick Ness' genius almost satirical take on common YA tropes, while focusing on the realistic issues of protagonist Mikey and his family and friends. It covers relationship drama, OCD, eating disorders, absent parents, and so on, with a diverse cast of characters. My favourite was Jared - Mikey's gay best friend who has an affinity with cats - but I appreciated how real and normal the characters felt. Their flaws and relationships were well written. It felt authentic and relatable, with nice spots of weirdness and fun. Such a refreshing read that doesn't fit easily into one \"genre\".I flew through this book and I didn't want it to end. It's very different from his previous books and perhaps more \"ordinary\", but as always there's dashes of his signature style that's unique and kind of odd at times (in a good way.) There's a nice balance between humour and seriousness. Some of the themes can be pretty intense, but I especially appreciated how the mental health element was portrayed. It's a great Young Adult book in how it deals with being \"ordinary\" and having realistic issues. I know that I often as a younger teen looked up to the \"indie kids\" in popular fiction and craved that kind of excitement. Of course when I started a new school I was going to instantly make new friends, get a hot mysterious boyfriend and save the world. (Reality: I was invisible and spent a lot of the time at library reading books.) The Rest of Us Just Live Here tells us a story that's more closer to home of the kids in the background who are just as extraordinary in their own way. I think it's pretty awesome and I highly recommend it, whether you love Patrick Ness already or you're new to his books. Source: EdelweissI received this book from the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review (though I'm totally going to buy a hard copy as soon as I can justify spending money on a book I've already read and read it again) Initial Review:I'll write a full review closer to the release but for now, here are my initial thoughts: I really enjoyed this book. Patrick Ness is one of my favourite authors and I've been excited about this from the moment it was announced. Immediately I fell in love with the concept. It's the kind of book I've been wanting to read for years and it didn't disappoint. It's not my new favourite Patrick Ness book but it was a really, really great read. I loved the start of each chapter, the subtle humour concerning YA tropes, the reality of the characters and their lives, and generally the writing itself. It's a Patrick Ness twist on a YA contemporary novel with a Buffy episode backdrop. The mix of humour and emotion was spot on. I really appreciated the way mental health was handled, the relationships with the characters, their flaws, and Jared in general. Haha the cats! I really loved him.I'd highly recommend checking this out - it's a refreshing and brilliant read with diverse and real characters. While you wait for the release date, be sure to read the author's other Young Adult novels if you haven't already! A Monster Calls, the Chaos Walking trilogy and More Than This are all amazing.Also I adore both covers. I'm pretty sure I'll end up buying both of them."}, {"userName": "Will M.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20408288-will-m", "userReview": "Contemporary YA is not my genre, but this novel was an exception. I prejudged it based on the first few chapters, but as the plot developed, I started to like it. This is a novel about a group of friends who wants to have a normal life. They just want to graduate before the school blows up. Mysterious and paranormal things get in their way, but they did all they could to succeed.What was most striking to me was the fact that Ness managed to incorporate a lot of serious issues in this novel. It was supposed to be a fun novel, but it was both fun and eye opening. He tackled multiple issues like depression, anxiety, and more. The novel was a mixture of laughter and sadness. Near the end was the part of sadness creeping in.I really liked how the characters developed and how they were connected to each other. I always ask for a novel with good characters, and this one has that. the transformation of the main character was commendable. He became a lot independent and wise, as compared to what he was in the first few chapters.The plot was light and straightforward. The premise didn't wander off from its promise, so it's not disappointing in that aspect. The plot was too simple though, for me. Ness could've added more interesting elements, and that would've made me give this a higher rating.4/5 stars. Impressive new novel from Patrick Ness. I enjoyed most of his other novels, so it wasn't a surprise that I enjoyed this one too. It's always a whole lot of guessing when it comes to Ness. Like how I kept on guessing how the novel was going to end. Things didn't go my way, but I liked how he ended things."}, {"userName": "Neil (or bleed)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14057379-neil-or-bleed", "userReview": "The Rest of Us Just Live Here is a weird-and-not kind of book. I mean it's weird because it's not about the Chosen Ones (or the indie kids as this novel called them) and it's not weird because it's not about the Chosen Ones. (You got me?)In this world we live in, we would rather read a kick-ass hero/heroine who saves the world than reading a bunch of boring kids who want to graduate high school, no? This is the main concept of this book. So, if you're not into this kind of novel, you will probably not enjoy this one. (But who knows, right?) Me? I really did enjoy and appreciate this novel. Because, I kinda relate to the main characters' feelings. And I can share the same sentiments with them.But seriously, this book is weiiiiiiiird because the main characters (not the indie kids) were living their ordinary lives in a world where there's something strange and extraordinary is happening. Something that include Immortals, Gods, zombie deers, etc. If you think about it, this is cool even you are just the ordinary kids who wants to graduate and not the Chosen Ones who will save the town or the world.As a reader who can't really describe things well, I found myself captivated and fascinated by this book. The original plot, the beautiful writing, the diverse characters, the intriguing setting, the funny dialogues, the mystery, the lessons and insights. All of it. I love them all. But, I do really love how Ness tell this story. The emotion inserted in every word that made my reading experience so so damn good. The Rest of Us Just Live Here seemed ordinary but actually, it is extraordinary.As a conclusion, I think the book's main goal is to impart the insight of living your life to the fullest, in a cliche-or-not way. Which you shouldn't forget that even you aren't a hero that will save the world, you are the hero of your life. You are extraordinary and most importantly, you are loved.

They\u2019re too cool to ever, ever do anything like go to prom or listen to music other than jazz while reading poetry. They\u2019ve always got some story going on that they\u2019re heroes of. The rest of us just have to live here, hovering around the edges, left out of it all, for the most part.\u201d  Actual rating: 3.25\u2b50\ufe0fStory \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fImagine your living in a town where weird things happen. Like one day the undead attacked, then there were soul eating ghosts and after this a really really weird vampire cycle of romance and death. But your not like the indie kids, you aren\u2019t in the middle of all the trouble. No, your just a normal guy (well, at least he tries to be normal - and what does normal even mean?) who wants to go to prom with your friends and your best friend Hannah who you are in love with since a long time. Even though it was kind of entertaining, it was also a bit boring. I didn\u2019t really feel the story or the characters. I was just reading this book wanting to be finished with it and having no feeling at all about it. Weird, I know. Characters \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThere is Mikey our main character who\u2019s in love with his best friend Hannah and haven\u2019t told her anything about it. His mother wants to be a part of the US Congress and is pressuring her children into being perfect. But Mikey and his sisters are nothing like perfect. No, they have anxieties and there have problems that sometimes could get them killed. No, there are not perfect. But they felt human. They had their problems and they had friends they could talk with. They had families and weird people at school. Even though I liked the personalities of the characters, I didn\u2019t love them. I liked them, that\u2019s all. Relationships \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fWell, Mikey is in love with Hannah. And Hannah is in love with the new kid Nathan. And Nathan is in love with... Mel is flirting with people and Meredith, Mikey\u2019s little sister, is crazy about a boy band. Writing style \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fI fell in love with Patrick Ness writing when I read \u201cA monster calls\u201d. Even though I liked it in this book, it wasn\u2019t as good as in \u201ca monster calls\u201d. It was okay. Nice and readable. I especially liked the parts with the paranormal stuff before a chapter started."}, {"userName": "Stacey (prettybooks)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3533262-stacey-prettybooks", "userReview": "A new Patrick Ness novel is always a big event and this was no less exciting. I avoided reading all reviews of the book before I started because I wanted to be surprised, especially as I know Patrick Ness has a habit of doing just that.If you read a lot of young adult fantasy or science fiction, you'll have come across teenagers that fight vampires, wield magic and join rebel groups to fight against the government or zombies. They are known as the indie kids. The Rest of Us Just Live Here is about the teenagers who live in the same world as the indie kids, but who are just trying to get through their everyday lives. Because they aren't the Chosen Ones.The Rest of Us Just Live here is a satire of young adult literature, but a friendly one. It's about the teenagers who aren't named Finn or Satchel, who aren't 'dying beautifully of cancer', and who aren't here to save the world. They're ordinary and their problems are ordinary and their friends and families are ordinary. But they're a joy to read about, especially as a fan of young adult contemporary fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed the concept and it made me feel a little odd, as if I were living in a world where all these fantastical things were happening in the background and I was just going about my life, talking about books on social media, going to the cinema and meeting friends for frozen yoghurt. At the beginning of each chapter, we're told all about the exciting and dangerous adventures the indie kids have been on, and they make an appearance in the normal lives of our protagonists because they're someone's friends and classmates, too.The Rest of Us Just Live Here is a well-written and wonderful exploration of what it's like to grow up. It's a mix of the closeness you feel to the characters in Chaos Walking, the sadness of A Monster Calls, and the delicate tackling of mental health in More Than This. I adore Mikey's little sister Meredith, who is much like me and my obsession with Taylor Swift. I enjoyed the friendship between Mikey and his best friend Jared, and watching him reveal his feelings for Henna. And I thought the way Patrick Ness approached anxiety and OCD \u2013 from showing the difference between obsession and compulsion, and the way anxiety can make someone feel like you're the one your friends could do without, to confirming that no one is to blame for their own mental health \u2013 was important and much-needed. The Rest of Us Just Live Here might not be as fast-paced as Chaos Walking, as mind-boggling as More Than This or as frightening as A Monster Calls, but it'll stay with you all the same.Thank you to the publisher for providing this book for review!I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books."}, {"userName": "Pip", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5765758-pip", "userReview": "Video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcH1K..."}, {"userName": "Sylvie", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64899539-sylvie", "userReview": "The Rest of Us Just Live HereBy Patrick Ness3.25/5 Stars!All I've heard of Patrick Ness were how wonderful and amazing his books are, so I decided to pick up one of his books and in this case it was 'The Rest of Us Just Live Here'.This book was something I've never experienced with reading before, because instead of following the storyline of the heroes, it follows the normal people. The people who see everything happen and just have to continue their lives despite the demons, vampires and exploding buildings. At the beginning of each chapter there is a brief overview of what happens to these 'heroes', the so-called 'indie kids', and then the story goes on. This group of friends aka the main characters: Mikey (has anexiety), his sister Mel (used to be anorexic), Henna (being controlled by her parents) and Jared (has some kind of godly powers) just want to graduate, and hope that the school will not explode again before they finish their senior year. Very original (credit to that) and fun, although I do not give it five stars, because the idea of the summary was better than the actual book.The whole plot was weirdly interesting, but it had so many clich\u00e9s in it.

After reading More Than This though, I really don't know how I expected any of his other books to measure up. By regular standards this book really wasn't that bad. It was exactly what it advertised itself as. A book about the boring kids that are always stuck in the background and their boring lives. It was a boring book about the boring kids but it still managed to be relatable in a way that hurt the 16-year-old girl still living inside of me. When I was 16, I was Mikey. It was almost painful to read about his struggles and for that extremely personal reason, I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't recommend it though. Go read More Than This, that book is a masterpiece.

Eles falam em deuses (N\u00e3o de uma maneira subjetiva, eles realmente existem), de vampiros, fantasmas, etc. Mas 80% do livro \u00e9 sobre o dia a dia de 4/5 adolescentes de uns 17 anos, sofrendo seus problemas cotidianos. Pra deixar a hist\u00f3ria mais din\u00e2mica, o personagem principal est\u00e1 voltando a ter epis\u00f3dios de TOC, e a irm\u00e3 dele j\u00e1 teve dist\u00farbios alimentares. Falar sobre esses assuntos em livros pra esse p\u00fablico jovem, \u00e9 sempre enriquecedor, e quando feito de forma delicada e profunda, j\u00e1 merece uma estrelinha extra. Al\u00e9m disso, TEM PERSONAGEM LGBT, e eu amei ele, por mais que tenha uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o que foi muito babaca e eu fiquei com \u00f3dio por alguns instantes.E pra finalizar, o mais divertido disso tudo, \u00e9 que as partes fant\u00e1sticas do livro s\u00e3o realmente apenas quest\u00f5es paralelas, porque N\u00c3O, esse n\u00e3o \u00e9 um livro que o personagem principal \u00e9 o chosen one que vai desvendar tudo sozinho.

The rest of us just have to live here, hovering around the edges, left out of it all, for the most part.\"\nI'm a little taken aback by how much I enjoyed this little tale devoid of knives and murder and grand soundbites. The Rest of Us Just Live Here, like its blurb advertises, is about normal kids doing normal stuff, encountering normal problems, while the Clarys and Meghans and Harrys fight supernatural stuff and have sweeping adventures. At the beginning of every chapter, we get a little peek into what the \"indie kids\"are up to. \n\"Chapter the fourteenth, in which Satchel doubts the Prince's intentions towards her; he weeps, professing his eternal love, one that he's been waiting to give for millennia but had never found a repository for until he met Satchel.\"\nSavage. Absolutely savage. Ness pokes fun of YA tropes, like how characters never seem to use the Internet (Hiya, Nora Grey) and the weird names they have (Hiya, Eureka). The protagonist Mike, on the other hand, struggles with his OCD. He helps his sister, who is a recovering anorexic. He takes his little sister to see a boy band. He has an alcoholic father and a mother who's running for Congress. Mundane stuff that Ness somehow makes interesting through excellent characterization and by drawing on worries we have in our everyday lives. What am I going to do after high school? What happens if me and my friends drift apart? We don't get definite endings for every plot line, but the book ends with a message of hope. Life goes on and you just roll with the punches, doing the best you can.The diversity Ness weaves into the cast is awesome, too. But what I really want to praise is its portrayal of mental illness.\n\"Feelings don't try to kill you, even the painful ones. Anxiety is a feeling grown too large. A feeling grown aggressive and dangerous. You're responsible for its consequences, you're responsible for treating it. But Michael, you're not responsible for causing it. You're not morally at fault for it. No more than you would be for a tumor.\"\nTaking medication isn't admitting defeat. It's usually healthy and necessary, and I wish more books showed it that way.You can pretty much tell by how short this review is that I'm struggling to find the right words to pitch this book.

Satire! A light, YA satire or even a full-on lampoon of the entire industry.\"I was hooked. I had only been reading a few pages.Little did I know that I could *then* begin reading it on multiple levels, even having our endearingly flawed non-Indie narrator spelling it out for us, that all the magic doesn't necessarily have to be real for us to believe it, but he does, and so does his friends, and that's cool and he doesn't have to believe our reality, either. :)*Jaw Drops*Okay! That's pretty damn well awesome and clearly stated and I can't love either interpretation more than I already do. And strangely enough, all these quirky-queer deer-god encounters only compliments and deepens the other half of the story, which is actually about finding your way to adulthood and exploring possibilities.But you ask, \"Isn't that what all these UF YA novels do?\"Sure, but I haven't read any that has been as self-consciously entertaining, creative, or straightforward about it. Ness knows the industry like a master. All those quirky flavors of the mass market teeny-books are expressed so deftly and interestingly in their own right, and I fairly stood up and started clapping at the chapter summaries... (Right before I began parsing how those chapter summaries *actually* fit into the real text. (Which is often not clear at first glance, but also completely unnecessary for our enjoyment of the text.:))I think Patrick Ness might be becoming one of those *always read* authors for me. I can't *not* trust that he'll be creative, clear, and a veritable master of his craft. Not only that, but I seem to be having a huge amount of fun every time I read his work.
