This novel definitely reflects the time of a developing city and a sense of place. Although it begins in England in 1884, the story shifts quickly to NYC when Sara Smythe takes a job at a new upscale apartment building in New York, The Dakota. The Dakota is a real building and still stands. Sara's story alternates with the modern day story in 1985 of Bailey Camden. At first the main connection of the two time frames was The Dakota until Bailey finds Sara's belongings in the basement of the building and their link becomes so much more . The novel is engaging in some ways as Sara's life in her first year in NYC. I felt for Bailey in the modern story as she struggles upon her return from rehab. But after one chapter of the modern day, I wanted to be back a century. It could be that I'm just getting a little weary of dual time frame stories which are hard to escape these days. The thing that kept me from rating this higher was that I just found it too predictable and assumed correctly everything that happens in the end of both stories. Even though I was somewhat disappointed, there are many 4 and 5 star reviews, so I may be an outlier here. You should read those reviews as well.

The Dakota apartment building on the Upper West Side provides a link between two women one hundred years apart. I enjoyed learning about the history of The Dakota, as well as trying to figure out the century-old murder mystery presented. I loved how the dual time periods were mid-1880s and mid-1980s, so really it's historical fiction inside historical fiction. Sara and Bailey are both sympathetic and relatable characters. I enjoyed the author's straight-forward writing style, and the twists revealed at the end were simply delicious.

The Gilded Age is a fascinating time, and having lived in NYC for four years, I love learning about its rich history. I was definitely engaged in the mystery and wanted to see how the two timelines would come together. It took a strange left turn about halfway through and from that point, I wasn\u2019t as engaged.

Keeping with iconic Manhattan landmarks, her fabulous new release, The Address is set in alternating timelines; in the late 1800s during the building of the Dakota, the architecturally stunning residence on the upper west side of Manhattan, Sara, a housekeeper at a fancy London hotel meets Theo, the talented NYC architect, takes a job at the newly built Dakota, and craziness ensues. Their budding relationship remains hidden from his wife and children as they bond, it turns passionate and a crime is committed. In 1985, fresh out of rehab and penniless, designer Bailey, a descendant of the wealthy Dakota architect, without genetic proof, is not in line for the healthy inheritance. Her cousin, Melinda, set to take over the family riches, hires her to orchestrate the renovation of the building and Bailey learns of her architect relative\u2019s murder by a crazy lady named Sara. And so the two compelling stories come together with rich historic detail and wonderfully creative characters, revealing the secrets from inside the unique and wonderful Dakota.I had a chance to connect with the lovely Fiona Davis and ask her a few questions about her new and successful career as an author.What has been the high point in your writing journey from the release of The Dollhouse to now? From your first public book talk to a People Magazine feature, you have accomplished so much in such a short time!I have to say, the first book talk for The Dollhouse seemed so scary! It was at a library in Westport, CT and there were more people than I expected to show up for a debut author. My knees were definitely knocking. But I loved every minute of it, especially answering questions after the reading. Now I adore doing Q&As and book talks, and I think those are my high points. The readers are so knowledgeable and inquisitive and their support has been amazing.What are you reading now and what do you recommend for the summer?I\u2019m currently reading Mrs. Fletcher by Tom Perrotta, and next up is Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, by Gail Honeyman. I\u2019d recommend Eve Chase\u2019s The Wildling Sisters, Jamie Brenner\u2019s The Forever Summer as great vacation/beach reads.Can you tell me a little about what you are working on now?The next book is a similar structure, two times periods with a connecting mystery, set in Grand Central Terminal, and I\u2019m having such a good time researching and writing it. I won\u2019t give away too much, but I will say I\u2019ve learned some really surprising things about the building that I can\u2019t wait to share with readers.Are you developing a \u201cformula\u201d or pattern you use for writing? I do love setting books in architectural landmarks and using dual time periods, so I definitely have a trend going on there. Once the Grand Central book is done, I\u2019ll start thinking about other locales and possibly structures, but so far I\u2019ve been having the time of my life. The pattern for each book, even though it\u2019s similar, is incredibly challenging and rewarding.I am now officially excited for the new book, I loved The Dollhouse, and I highly recommend the Fiona Davis\u2019 new release. With two connected stories, old New York, ornate architecture, an illicit affair, an illegitimate child, an insane asylum, and the beautiful Dakota on the upper west side, The Address is a perfect mix of history and mystery, fast pace and fun."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "EXCERPT: London, June 1884The sight of a child teetering on the window ledge of Room 510 turned Sara's world upside down. ABOUT THIS BOOK: Fiona Davis, author of The Dollhouse, returns with a compelling novel about the thin lines between love and loss, success and ruin, passion and madness, all hidden behind the walls of The Dakota\u2014New York City\u2019s most famous residence.After a failed apprenticeship, working her way up to head housekeeper of a posh London hotel is more than Sara Smythe ever thought she\u2019d make of herself. But when a chance encounter with Theodore Camden, one of the architects of the grand New York apartment house The Dakota, leads to a job offer, her world is suddenly awash in possibility\u2014no mean feat for a servant in 1884. The opportunity to move to America, where a person can rise above one\u2019s station. The opportunity to be the female manager of The Dakota, which promises to be the greatest apartment house in the world. And the opportunity to see more of Theo, who understands Sara like no one else...and is living in The Dakota with his wife and three young children.In 1985, Bailey Camden is desperate for new opportunities. Fresh out of rehab, the former party girl and interior designer is homeless, jobless, and penniless. Two generations ago, Bailey\u2019s grandfather was the ward of famed architect Theodore Camden. But the absence of a genetic connection means Bailey won\u2019t see a dime of the Camden family\u2019s substantial estate. Instead, her \u201ccousin\u201d Melinda\u2014Camden\u2019s biological great-granddaughter\u2014will inherit almost everything. So when Melinda offers to let Bailey oversee the renovation of her lavish Dakota apartment, Bailey jumps at the chance, despite her dislike of Melinda\u2019s vision. The renovation will take away all the character and history of the apartment Theodore Camden himself lived in...and died in, after suffering multiple stab wounds by a madwoman named Sara Smythe, a former Dakota employee who had previously spent seven months in an insane asylum on Blackwell\u2019s Island.One hundred years apart, Sara and Bailey are both tempted by and struggle against the golden excess of their respective ages\u2014for Sara, the opulence of a world ruled by the Astors and Vanderbilts; for Bailey, the free-flowing drinks and cocaine in the nightclubs of New York City\u2014and take refuge and solace in the Upper West Side\u2019s gilded fortress. But a building with a history as rich\u2014and often tragic\u2014as The Dakota\u2019s can\u2019t hold its secrets forever, and what Bailey discovers in its basement could turn everything she thought she knew about Theodore Camden\u2014and the woman who killed him\u2014on its head.With rich historical detail, nuanced characters, and gorgeous prose, Fiona Davis once again delivers a compulsively readable novel that peels back the layers of not only a famed institution, but the lives\u2014and lies\u2014of the beating hearts within. MY THOUGHTS: Just like 'The Dollhouse', 'The Address' had me spellbound for most of its telling. Although Davis has bent the historical facts a little to fit her timeline, most of the major events backgrounding this story actually happened, just not when they happened in the novel. I am more than prepared to forgive her this. The Address is told over two timelines, beginning in 1884 and 1984. The characters in the two times couldn't be more different. 1884 - Sara is a hard working young woman determined not to repeat her mother's mistakes. 1984 - Bailey has tumbled ignominiously from the peak of her career and is trying to claw her way back up. Sara is kind-hearted and eager to please. Bailey has been selfish and pleasure seeking, and is now trying to find her feet, playing by a whole new set of rules. Davis had me unsuccessfully trying to figure out the connection between these two women. The answer, when it came, was unexpected but brilliant. And perhaps that is where the book should have ended, but it didn\u2019t. At this point, I would have awarded it very close to 5-stars. But it went on to tie everything up very neatly into an almost fairytale like ending which, for me, somewhat spoiled the ambience. I see Fiona Davis has a new novel being released later this year, The Masterpiece. I will be first in line for it. She is a magnificent story teller.I listened to The Address by Fiona Davis, narrated by Saskia Maarleveld and Brittany Pressley and published by Penguin Audio via OverDrive.

People in the story had dissonant character changes; for example, more than one person seemed to morph into evil beings just to bring the story to the writer's successful conclusions. I really loved the first half until these sudden changes occurred. The story of the modern day girl was more successful than the girl from the past. The woman from the 1880s seemed to fall into bed rather easily for a woman from that era."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl", "userReview": "New York City in the 1880\u2019s was on the brink of expansion. Wealthy families had built magnificent homes there, and more construction was underway. The Dakota, was a newly built grand structure. It was one of the first luxury multi family residences to be constructed on the Upper West Side of New York. Into this setting, Sara Smythe arrives from London where she had been head housekeeper at an elegant hotel. She agreed to come to New York at the request of architect Theodore Camden. He has hired her to be the \u201cmanagerette\u201d of the Dakota. Sara hopes this new position will provide opportunities for a better life. The Dakota in 1985 has fallen into disrepair. Bailey Camden, a recovering alcoholic, is trying to reestablish herself as a respected interior designer. Her cousin, Melinda Camden, has hired Bailey to redecorate her apartment in the Dakota. While sorting through items in the Dakota\u2019s storage rooms, Bailey discovers that there are long buried secrets in her family. She decides that it is time to uncover the truth about her family\u2019s history.Author Fiona Davis\u2019 well written novel evokes a real sense of place as she weaves together a story about two women whose lives are connected even though the distance between them spans a century.

The title is cleverly drawn from a review of the building following its opening in 1885 in which the reviewer stated that \u201cthe Dakota will undoubtedly be known as \u2018The Address\u2019 of New York\u2019s West Side.\u201d Davis melds historical events with a spectacular tale of greed, passion, love and sacrifice told in a dual timeline format alternating between the mid-1880\u2019s and 1985. While I enjoyed both stories, I preferred Bailey\u2019s in 1985 because I found poor Sara\u2019s story so sad. The ending of The Address was spectacular because Davis cleverly connects the two tales and includes a surprise I never saw coming. It was perfect.My favorite part of the book was the inclusion of so much historical detail regarding The Dakota. It is fascinating to me that the walls are stuffed with thick horsehair and the space between each floor contains three feet of mud. Davis explains why each apartment is shaped differently, and the complex effort it took to accomplish that feat. She also mentions the ghosts that reside there, and the numerous famous people that lived there over The Dakota\u2019s life. She includes so many more fabulous stories and descriptions, but I do not have enough time nor space to include them all. Her Author\u2019s Note at the end was welcome as she explained the events she altered a bit for the sake of her story. I always appreciate when an author takes the time to elaborate on his or her inspiration and to clarify purposeful historical inaccuracies.The Address is a superb read. I look forward to my next trip to New York City when I plan to walk by The Dakota and pay attention in person to the many details I learned while reading this wonderful book."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "The first half was entertaining. The second half, not. It became so far-fetched in too many extreme circumstances and most dire possible character outcomes, that I found it basically not believable. And frankly, with several ending detail scenes- it became like a long term soap opera series that jumped the shark. 2.5 star rounded up for the first 1/2 of the book with all the Dakota style detailing and physical world building for the earlier period. The 1985 sections, from the beginning, I had next to no embedding within Bailey's story or even less in her friend Miranda's. Those two protagonists were not core formed to depth characterizations at all- they seemed as merely flat 30 something Manhattan up and coming \"cut outs\". With all the inherent foaming and emoting ire and angst and graveling for association up sweeps to get ahead. \"What can YOU do FOR me, darling!\" kind of people. The formula Fiona Davis holds for the \"building category\" core of her novels or home place structure- that's a good one and it does work, even here. But that's about the only thing that made for continuity in the larger sense of a credible progression pace, IMHO. Bloodlines might have, but with the depth of those characters connected in particular within this particular \"truth\" revealed in the last chapter? Nope.With respect to those who disagree, there is another genre issue here that, for me anyway, is truly misleading. This balance of novel between romance, adventure,mystery etc. is murky to naming! But it certainly is NOT historical fiction as I define historical fiction. It's chick lit period piece with romance and crime highlights to a much farther degree in proportion to inclusion of historical fact quotient."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56509454-kathleen", "userReview": "This is an engaging work of historical fiction and a great travel read if you want to escape for a few hours. The dual-timeline story begins in 1884 as the Dakota is about to open for residents in New York City. We are introduced to Sara Smythe in London while some life changing events happen, that ultimately lead her to a new job and residence at the Dakota. The additional timeline is approximately 100 years later as Bailey Camden recovers from her own life-changing events that lead her to a job and temporary residence, overseeing a renovation at the Dakota in 1985.Bailey and Sara are both searching for answers and doing their best to take control of their own lives. The novel is well researched, and a fun read. I love old buildings and can easily get lost in imagination, just thinking of what may have taken place within their walls through so many generations.

As this building passes from generation to generation, within the Camden family, more questions are raised and more answers are found.

There were parts of the story that I really liked while other sections of the book didn't capture my attention as well. This was a book that was never really hard for me to set aside. I actually started reading it just before bed and never had any desire to read more than one chapter. The story was never one that made me want to put my other reads aside and was really a rather slow start. I didn't have a hard time finishing it but the book seemed to lack that something extra that really seems to grab my attention.This story is told through dual timelines. The parts of the book that focus on Sara Smythe take place in 1884, while the section of the book from Bailey's point of view occur in 1985. As is often the case with this kind of story, I found myself enjoying one of the timelines much more than the other. Sara's story was really just so much more than Bailey's and anytime the book made the switch to 1985, I found myself wanting to put it down. There were a few times in the book when something that happened in 1985 would hint at an event that was going to happen in the earlier time period which took away some of the excitement. There were things that I really liked about the story. Sara Smythe was a character that was easy to like. She was very capable and was able to come up with impossible solutions quite quickly. The descriptions in the book were really well done. It was so interesting to see this famous building just as it was starting to be lived in. There were a few times in the book that I was really quite surprised by the turn the story took. While I thought that the 1985 time period was described quite well, I just had a hard time connecting with anything going on in that timeline. Bailey was not as easy to like as Sara. The Dakota's super and the neighbor downstairs were much easier to like. Bailey did grown on my by the end of the book but I still always preferred Sara's story.I think that a lot of readers will enjoy this one a bit more than I did. I would recommend that anyone who is interested in this story to give it a try. I would not hesitate to read more from Fiona Davis in the future.I received an advance reader edition of this book from Penguin Publishing Group - Dutton via First to Read.Initial ThoughtsI liked this book but found it really easy to put down.

I\u2019ve read so much more HF this past year and I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve without reading The Dollhouse, so thanks Fiona Davis for expanding my world!Having been such a fan of her debut I had that nervous feeling I always feel when I\u2019m about to read an authors sophmore book. Well, I shouldn\u2019t have worried at all, I ended up liking this one even more than her first, it was mesmerizing, full of detailed historical descriptions, an amazing setting and two characters that I fully connected with.This is told using dual narratives set one hundred years apart. Sara is a thirty year old woman who moves from England to New York for a job opportunity in 1884 and Bailey is also thirty and living in NYC in 1985. Both of the timelines were equally fascinating for me, they were both mainly set in the famed Dakota Apartments and Davis truly brought this wonderful setting to life. Most of the book was historically accurate and the liberties she took fictionally were perfectly executed. I really felt like I was beside both women in the Dakota, it was such an immersive, engrossing setting.Sara and Bailey had many similarities despite being from two completely different worlds. They both have struggles and difficulties to overcome and I was rooting for them the whole way. I found myself sympathizing easily with both of them and couldn\u2019t wait to find out what would wind up happening with their lives.This is one of those books that will truly sweep you away to another time, there is such a strong sense of place that really worked well for me. While this isn\u2019t a traditional mystery there were some surprises along the way that add another layer to the wonderful plot.

Flash-forward about a hundred years, in the autumn of 1985, Bailey is out of rehab, fired from her job and without anywhere she goes. In a panic, she turns to her cousin and finds herself in The Dakota. \u00a0The novel goes back and forth between these perspectives where Davis weaves a tale of love, the quest for success and betrayal within one of New York\u2019s most famous residences.I sometimes find myself disconnected when I read historical fiction. I think it comes from the fact that I am unable to relate to the characters due to language or general situations; however, in this case, I found the opposite to be true. I was fully connected with both Sara and Bailey throughout my reading. Both of these characters are sort of lost and trying their best to make it with what they have, struggling to fit in, struggling to find their place and struggling to ensure they pretend they know what they are doing with their lives. Amen to that. David does a fantastic job at staying historically accurate while keeping her characters realistic and relevant.I knew that this book was sticking with me while I found myself wondering about what would happen during my lunchtime fitness class. I really loved the shape of how this one unfolded; Sara\u2019s story is moving linearly while Bailey is discovering hers in reverse. Therefore, most of the twists happen fairly early on and it is clear that an incident occurred but Davis slowly draws out the pieces and weaves the plot slowly while building tension. By the end of the novel, when these two parallel worlds finally collided, I felt like I would burst if everything wasn't revealed.\u00a0Overall, I can now say with confidence that I am pretty much obsessed with the work of Fiona Davis and will anxiously await her next novel; in the meantime, you\u2019ll find me hunting down a copy of The Dollhouse. If you are a fan of any sort of historical fiction or a story that builds tension while focusing on character relationships, you will absolutely devour The Address.

Behind the walls of the famous residence, lines crossed, never to untie again. Davis presented her story via the dual perspectives and timelines of Sara Smythe, an English immigrant in 1885 and Bailey Camden, party girl turned interior designer in 1985. These characters connect without ever meeting. But, their connection demonstrated how precious the story's themes stretch generations.SettingPrior to reading this tale, The Dakota's majesty and reputation spoke to me. John Lennon's murder occurred there. \"Rosemary's Baby\" used the complex as its setting. Famous artists, such as Roberta Flack, Lauren Bacall, Leonard Bernstein, and Albert Maysles, chose the grandeur as their residence. Thus, on setting alone, I wanted to read this book. I'm glad I made the choice. Davis clearly adored the place as her research shows hours of information, granting full transparency of The Dakota's history and personality. As the reader enters the complex's walls, you're sucked in, wishing you signed a lease to stay.Furthermore, NYC's historical background granted more than enough to strike an interest. Davis included slivers of actual moments, such as the delivery of the Statue of Liberty and the dawn of New York City before the first skyscraper. You felt the hunger and determination of the fresh faces, desperate to get by to the next day.Verdict: A, Davis' research showed throughout the story.\u00a0PlotDavis set a clear plot without much confusion. In 1885, Sara Smythe worked as the head housekeeper of a grand London hotel, when one day, she saves the life of a little girl. As a token of appreciation, the little girl's father, an architect, invited her to work for him, promising higher status than earned there. With secrets and a past, she wished to avoid, Sara accepts the position and immigrates to NYC, fresh-faced and fresh in reputation. Once there, she serves as the head manager (\"managerette\" in prefeminist terms at the time). However, after a brief tryst, she struggles to get her head above water after a series of hardship and mistreatment.\u00a0Whereas, in 1985, down and out of rehab, Bailey Camden wished to create a new start. She's a social pariah after an embarrassing moment at a party, threatening her interior designing career. Given the chance to restart, she makes the most of her new opportunity, but when curiosity strikes her, she finds more than she expected underground.Verdict: B, Melodrama mashed with a straight-forward story of the aforementioned themes in an given Aaron Spelling series kept me interested as it would another reader.CharactersOutside of your basic characters, like her father, a love interest, and cousin, focus stayed on three characters: Sara Smythe and Bailey Camden.\u00a0Sara left home to seek a new life and when she arrives, not understanding the costs involved, she suffered, but never faltered under someone's thumb. She's a strong character, no matter how others treat her.\u00a0Additionally, we saw how women and the mentally ill's mistreated in this story during one of her experiences. Sara held her hair high. On the other hand, Bailey's less strong, but still doesn't quite gives up. She completed her rehab, and despite shunning from snooty packs, she's determined to make a way for herself.\u00a0Both women hunger for something fresh and exciting. Yet, they refuse to leave their backbones behind and sell themselves short for an easier life. While I found Sara's chapters more riveting, Bailey's provided glue I didn't know I wanted.Verdict: B, While there's some paint by numbers characterization, Sara and Bailey kept my attention.PacingA bit slow in the beginning, as aforementioned, Davis put the work in her story. Sometimes, she threw in a lot of history and description, which slowed the pace. Once the story gained its footing, the pacing quickened.Verdict: C, Too much research bogs the story down. Don't bore us. Get to the chorus.ConclusionThis story, albeit tragic and serious, about two strong-willed women seeking their paths amid drama, scandal, and joy entertained me. However, this story slowed a bit in the beginning and engrossed me during Sara's chapters than Bailey's. But, I'd recommend this tale for historical fiction lovers nonetheless.Verdict: 3.5/5 Dakota lease agreements*Thanks to Penguin's First Reads for this reading opportunity in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/939601-alison", "userReview": "Before you start the book, Google images of the Dakota apartment building NYC so you can see the cool building at the center of this novel. Again, Davis splits the story between modern-day and the late 1880's. The stories of Sara and Bailey are well constructed, with just a couple holes I wish they would have filled in regarding Sara's background. I'm not an architecture buff by any means but was fascinated to read Theodore's thoughts about how NYC needs to expand which, we learn in the epilogue, was actually drawn from Edward Clark\u2019s 1879 speech to the West End Association. You learn a little about Blackwell Island Insane Asylum and the undercover journalist, Nellie Bly, who exposed the atrocities committed there. The discovery of DNA testing also plays a part in this book. I was thoroughly entertained and it's worth mentioning that there is no profanity, which I always appreciate!"}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1494253-angie", "userReview": "3.5 StarsEnjoyable historical fiction (late 1880s) that also includes a more modern storyline as well (1980s). I thought centering the story around a historical building that is still standing was a great move. I liked reading all about the Dakota and it's then innovations for the time. New York at this time in history is always interesting. The plot though, wasn't as innovative and was a little predictable. A few characters were annoying, and I felt frustrated with the decisions some of them made. (But that is how fiction is made, I know.). I did like the cameo appearances of several real life people from that time period, such as reporter Nellie Bly. The stories ended up intertwined nicely by the end and covered a lot of different struggles had by single women, and people in general during the era. I listened to it as an audiobook, and I found it interesting and entertaining to listen to while knee-deep in housework:)"}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802440-cynthia", "userReview": "The Address is a fun lighthearted fast paced read. It's about the famous Dakota residence apartment building that was built in the 1880's when it was off by twelfth surrounded by Central Park and farms. Davis includes a sprinkling of history alternating the 1880's with the 1980's though it's the older story that was most compelling. Though the storylines deal with serious topics the book remains escapist in feel.You'll most likely be familiar with some of the history don't miss the author's notes at the end where she lists where she learned of the real life folks in the story or got the idea for confabulating some real and made open characters.

But when a chance encounter with Theodore Camden, one of the architects of the grand New York apartment house The Dakota, leads to a job offer, her world is suddenly awash in possibility\u2014no mean feat for a servant in 1884. The opportunity to move to America, where a person can rise above\u00a0one\u2019s\u00a0station. The opportunity to be the female manager of The Dakota, which promises to be the greatest apartment house in the world. And the opportunity to see more of Theo, who understands Sara like no one else...and is living in The Dakota with his wife and three young children.In 1985, Bailey Camden\u00a0is desperate for new opportunities. Fresh out of rehab, the former party girl and interior designer is homeless, jobless, and penniless. Two generations ago, Bailey\u2019s grandfather was the ward of famed architect Theodore Camden. But the absence of a genetic connection means Bailey won\u2019t see a dime of the Camden family\u2019s substantial estate. Instead, her \u201ccousin\u201d\u00a0Melinda\u2014Camden\u2019s biological\u00a0great-granddaughter\u2014will inherit almost everything. So when Melinda offers to let Bailey oversee the renovation of her lavish Dakota apartment, Bailey jumps at the chance, despite her dislike of Melinda\u2019s vision. The renovation will take away all the character and history of the apartment Theodore Camden himself lived in...and died in, after suffering multiple stab wounds by a madwoman named Sara Smythe, a former Dakota employee who had previously spent seven months in an insane asylum on Blackwell\u2019s Island. One hundred years apart, Sara and Bailey are both tempted by and struggle against the golden excess of their respective ages\u2014for Sara, the opulence of a world ruled by the Astors and Vanderbilts; for Bailey, the free-flowing drinks and cocaine in the nightclubs of New York City\u2014and take refuge and solace in the Upper West Side\u2019s gilded fortress. But a building with a history as rich\u2014and often tragic\u2014as The Dakota\u2019s can\u2019t hold its secrets forever, and what Bailey discovers in its basement could turn everything she thought she knew about Theodore Camden\u2014and the woman who killed him\u2014on its head.
