Despite knowing his life was coming to a sooner end than it should, or perhaps because of this, he created a story about finding love in the final chapter. Our Souls at Night is simply, profoundly, an exquisite homage to love. And it broke my heart. Because, the story. Because, there will be no more. I read Our Souls at Night in one sitting and wept in the final pages. Even now, thinking of endings, of the ending of this book, the ending of an author I adore, I weep. I weep for aging bodies, for small, mean minds that do such damage, for the elderly, forgotten and alone. I weep for all the stories we will never witness. And I come full circle, to mourn a cherished voice silenced by disease and death. Kent Haruf is the author I take to other countries, pressing his name into the ears of readers not familiar with his work. \"Plainsong,\" I say, \"Eventide. Benediction. Purity. Wisdom. Grace. An American voice like no other.\" And to this, I add the perfection of Our Souls at Night. Addie Moore and Louis Waters are neighbors, familiar but not friends, in Haruf's conjured Holt, CO. In their 70s, they are both widowed and living alone with their fractured pasts. One day, Addie approaches Louis and asks if he would consider coming to her house occasionally, to share her bed. \nI\u2019m talking about getting through the night, she says. And lying warm in bed, companionably. Lying down in bed together and you staying the night. The nights are the worst. Don\u2019t you think?Yes. I think so, he says.\n That's all you really need to know about the plot. What follows is achingly beautiful and gracious and solemn; a meditation on living in the present, a requiem to the held hand. My heart is so full of admiration and affection for Kent Haruf, his stories, his characters, his dry, dusty, flat eastern Colorado. I ache for what was, what will never be again. I am thankful for this final, perfect book\u2014written for his wife and true love, Cathy\u2014and her generosity in sharing it with her husband's readers. Kent, you are so missed. Thank you."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "And then there was the day when Addie Moore made a call on Louis Waters.\nLouis and Addie are both getting on, in their 70s, Louis having lost his wife a year back, Addie a widow for some time. Both are lonely and could do with some company. While they have known each other for a long time, they have never been close. Acquaintances more than friends. Until Addie suggests that it would be a great help, given her trouble sleeping, if Louis would consent to sleep with her, not hide-the-salami sleep together, but sleep, and talk, in the same bed, overnight, companionship. Louis decides to give it a try. Addie and Louis slowly begin to share their histories. The biddies of Holt, male and female, are taken aback, of course, at the presumed impropriety, as if, once elderly and alone, it was somehow sinful to still want to have a life. There are scenes in which they each are put on the spot and made to defend themselves to snickering locals about their arrangement. Feel free to cheer. Fueling his unhappiness with permanent rage about his childhood, Addie\u2019s son, Gene, in particular, cannot tolerate his mother and Louis being together, projecting into it his fantasy that Louis is in the relationship to somehow swindle Addie out of her money. Problems ensue.Kent Haruf - 1943-2014A consistent focus in Haruf\u2019s novels is the unconventional family, whether of elderly brothers taking in a pregnant girl, or grandparents taking care of an eight-year old. Well, that may not be all that unconventional these days, but it still ain\u2019t Ozzie and Harriet. In this one, Addie\u2019s son, Gene, has his hands full with problems at home, so sends his son, Jamie, to stay with Addie for a stretch of summer. Addie, Louis and Jamie form a very close relationship. There are moving sequences of outings and bonding moments that exude love and comfort, a contrast to the difficult relationships experienced between closer blood relations and spouses. Another Haruf concern is loneliness, at all ages. It is not only the raison d\u2019etre of Louis and Addie\u2019s arrangement, but is considered in relation to their former marital relationships. The loneliness of others comes in for some attention as well. Connections from generation to generation are considered. There are causes and effects, but life carries on. Haruf said, in relation to Benediction\n in the very next house, there is this 8-year-old girl who is the representative of hope and promise and youth and joy. And so what I am wanting people to feel is that the beginning and the ending in all of our lives are set side-by-side. They are not distinct from one another.\nThe same could very well be applied here, connecting the lives of folks at both ends of their mortality. Haruf had been hoping to get to the January 2015 premier of the Denver Center production of a theater version of his novel Benediction. The cast is much reduced in Our Souls at Night relative to that of his prior novels. The focus is on the two main characters, with Jamie in a large supporting role, and remaining there for the entirety. Of course their history brings in other players, but most remain off-stage or pop by for cameos. Addie and Louis trade stories each night in bed. It is a simple and effective mechanism for looking at two lives, their effect on others and others\u2019 effects on them. Haruf used spare language, this, then that. If his writing were a font, it would be sans serif. And he is a master of showing instead of telling. After a rage-inducing encounter,  At home he went out to the garden and hoed for an hour, hard, almost violently\u2026. After a difficult scene, Haruf does not tell us how Louis feels. There was a woman on the elevator, she looked at his face once and looked away.His symbolism is also simple, and effective. The title refers not only to the time of day when Louis and Addie share their lives. It reminds us that time is short. A discussion about a nest of baby mice speaks to unpredictability. Robert Redford and Jane Fonda as Louis and Addie from the Netflix production - Image from VarietyIn an interview Haruf did with John Moore for The Denver Center, he talks about his use of references to his own work in the novel:\n Kent Haruf: \u2026 I will tell you there is a reference to the play\u00a0Benediction\u00a0in this new book. It's something these two old people have a little comment about. \u00a0John Moore: That's part of the fun of reading of your stories. Even in Benediction, which features all new characters, there are those small references that reward those people who have been with you from the beginning.\u00a0Kent Haruf: It does. And it was a chance for me to have a little fun. Exactly as you say, people who know these other stories will immediately recognize what I am talking about.\n He sets his tale in Holt, Colorado, a place that will be familiar to readers of his earlier work. In another meta moment, his characters refer to the location in reference to seeing a play of a Kent Haruf story! (not Benediction) as a way of letting readers know about his usual locale\n he took the physical details from Holt, the place names of the streets and what the country looks like and the location of things, but it\u2019s not this town. And it\u2019s not anybody in this town. All that\u2019s made up. \nWell, of course Holt is fictitious but Haruf is making sure readers do not assign the place entirely to a single real location. I guess he wanted to clear that up before he left us.\nas a writer, I want to be thought of as somebody who had a very small talent but worked as best he could at using that talent. I want to think that I have written as close to the bone as I could. By that I mean that I was trying to get down to the fundamental, irreducible structure of life, and of our lives with one another.  - from the Denver Center interview I would disagree about the dimensions of his talent, but there is no question that Kent Haruf has offered the readers a world-view that may be bare bones in its form, but which is glorious in its realization. Our Souls at Night, his sixth novel, is the last book we will ever have from Kent Haruf. It is hopeful without being saccharine. Sharing love as darkness approaches may be one of love\u2019s highest forms, offering no short term trade for a probably unrealistic long-term promise. It makes the sharing sweeter, in a way. I got the sense, without digging into specifics, that one thing Haruf was doing here was stopping off at some favorite spots in Holt for a final goodbye. Holt will remain available for generations of readers. Haruf passed away in November, 2014 at the age of 71. He will be missed.Review posted \u2013 6/26/15Publication date \u2013 5/16/15=============================EXTRA STUFFOther Kent Haruf books we have enjoyed-----Plainsong-----Eventide-----BenedictionHere is the complete  Denver Center interviewIn an  interview with Robert Birnbaum for the Identity Theory site In the  Reader\u2019s Guide  of Random House\u2019s page for the book, Haruf talks about how he worked:\nThe idea for the book has been floating around in my mind for quite a while. Now that I know I have, you know\u2014a limited time\u2014it was important to me to try to make good use of that time. So I went out there every day. Typically, I have always had a story pretty well plotted out before I start writing. This time I knew generally where the story was going, but I didn\u2019t know very many of the details. So as it happened, I went out every day trusting myself to be able to add to the story each day. So I essentially wrote a new short chapter of the book every day. I\u2019ve never had that experience before. I don\u2019t want to get too fancy about it, but it was like something else was working to help me get this done. Call it a muse or spiritual guidance, I don\u2019t know. All I know is that the trust I had in being able to write every day was helpful.\u201d \nThere is more info to be had on Haruf from wikipedia and Barnes and NobleThe Netflix film first aired on September 29, 2017. It is a wonderful translation to film, capturing the essence of the book extraordinarily well, and with performances that are as wonderful as the written characters.

His popularity swelled quickly, though, when he published his third novel, \u201cPlainsong,\u201d in 1999 at the age of 56. The book was a bestseller for months and a finalist for the National Book Award, which meant he had to dress up for the ceremony in New York and wear a medal on a ribbon around his neck and feel genuinely uncomfortable. Afterward, he told the New York Times, \u201cWe\u2019re nuts, crazy in this country about fame. We expect writers to be something between Hollywood starlet and a village idiot.\u201dBy the time he died last November at the age of 71, he had successfully avoided either of those fates and published five quiet, beloved novels about the people of Holt, Colo., a fictional town drawn from his itinerant adolescence. In his obituary, there was mention of a manuscript he\u2019d completed just before dying, and now we have a chance to read that final book. Such posthumous publications come trailing clouds of skepticism, but \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d is such a tender, carefully polished work that it seems a blessing we had no right to expect. . . .

His quiet stories in their simplicity are meaningful , thoughtful stories reflecting the complexity of the human condition. In his final novel , published posthumously, Haruf has given us another gift . I fell in love with this book from page one , the first sentence and then the perfect description of Cedar Street in Holt , Colorado the place where all his books take place . I fell in love with Louis Waters and Addie Moore and how they talk into the night about their lives and pasts , their transgressions , their hopes and desires , their losses , their families and how they bring joy to each other to ease the loneliness . I love how the title so perfectly reflects this. I love the humor and the honesty in their conversations. I love that Haruf could even make fun of himself as readers of other of his works will appreciate .It's a beautifully told story , sad yet uplifting and even sadder that this will be the last time we hear from this elegant writer . I'm sad it was such a short book . I will miss Louis and Addie's conversations. I'm not sure how I managed to miss reading one of his books but for some reason the only book of his that I haven't read is Where You once Belonged. I'm glad now that I have left myself one more . I've decided to save it for the next time I'm just not able to decide on what to read next . I'll read it then because I know it will be a good one .I am so grateful to Random House and Edelweiss for giving me the opportunity to read this ARC."}, {"userName": "Glenn Sumi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi", "userReview": "You\u2019d have to be stone-hearted not to respond to this beautiful little novel about late-in-life love and companionship.In a small Colorado town, widowed neighbours Addie Moore and Louis Waters, who've known each other for decades, agree to share their nights together rather than sleep alone. This arrangement doesn\u2019t involve sex, although gossiping neighbours assume it does; it\u2019s more about sleeping in the same bed, talking, revealing stuff they don\u2019t tell anyone else. This is how Addie explains her proposition to Louis: I mean we\u2019re both alone. We\u2019ve been by ourselves for too long. For years. I\u2019m lonely. I think you might be too. I wonder if you would come and sleep in the night with me. And talk.He stared at her, watching her, curious now, cautious.You don\u2019t say anything. Have I taken your breath away? she said.I guess you have.I\u2019m not talking about sex.I wondered.No, not sex. I\u2019m not looking at it that way. I think I\u2019ve lost any sexual impulse a long time ago. I\u2019m talking about getting through the night. And lying warm in bed, companionably. Lying down in bed together and you staying the night. The nights are the worst. Don\u2019t you think?Yes. I think so.Except for that awkward, five-syllable beaut \u201ccompanionably,\u201d this is terrific writing. Both have adult children from their marriages, and both have survived the big and little tragedies life has dealt them. As the nights pass and their defenses come down, they open up about their hopes, dreams and compromises, often withholding the really painful stuff until they\u2019re ready. Meanwhile, they have to deal with the townsfolk spreading rumours and the grumblings from their children, who live hours away. Addie\u2019s son is going through a separation and for a while her sad, insecure grandson comes to stay with her.The writing is exquisite: clear, funny, and unfussy, just like his characters. This was Kent Haruf\u2019s last book, and you can sense him dispensing with artifice to get to the heart of a character and situation. Even the book\u2019s opening lines get right to the point: And then there was the day when Addie Moore made a call on Louis Waters. It was an evening in May just before full dark.Simple. Folksy without being cloying, as if we\u2019re mid conversation and this story just\u2026 comes up. I don\u2019t want to say too much about the thin plot. But there are scenes that make my eyes water just thinking about them.Our Souls At Night is about living the examined life. It\u2019s about reaching out and really communicating, not just existing, not just breathing. To hell with what people think. It\u2019s your life. Live it. And while you\u2019re at it, read this book.***UPDATED Sep 9, 2016:: This is going to be an original Netflix film starring Jane Fonda as Addie and Robert Redford as Louis! Also in the cast will be Bruce Dern (Dorlan), Judy Greer (Holly), Matthias Schoenaerts (Gene) and Iain Armitage, from Big Little Lies, as Addie's grandson Jamie.

Ms Haruf ha fatto la comparsa nella scena del ristorante, quella in cui Addie e Louis sfidano i malpensanti di Holt.Sulle uscite postume di un artista si potrebbe scrivere un trattato. E forse \u00e8 stato fatto. Ma non ha comunque sconfitto la perplessit\u00e0: \u00e8 giusto o sbagliato?Per esempio, di Jimi Hendrix in vita sono usciti una manciata di album (3 pi\u00f9 3 live), dopo la morte dieci volte tanto!Che dire di questo breve ultimo romanzo di Haruf, una novella che l\u2019editore fa pi\u00f9 corposa disseminando pagine bianche? La mia sensazione pi\u00f9 acuta \u00e8 che non l\u2019avrebbe pubblicata cos\u00ec, che non era pronta per la stampa.Di ritorno a casa dopo la prima notte d\u2019amore.In cos\u00ec poche pagine ci sono diversi momenti che mi fanno pensare Haruf avrebbe volentieri riscritto. Per esempio, spero tanto che avrebbe eliminato lo stonato civettuolo ammiccamento al lettore, dove si autocita, e autocelebra, e autocompiace.Credo che avrebbe lavorato meglio il momento in cui i due anziani decidono finalmente di provare ad avere anche un rapporto fisico, oltre l\u2019amicizia che si \u00e8 venuta consolidando. Un momento clou che mi \u00e8 parso guastato da un eccesso, come dire, di buone maniere, di cortesia, di riguardo per i suoi due personaggi.Credo anche che avrebbe eliminato, dopo la magistrale scena alla cassa del supermercato (l\u2019anziana Ruth s\u2019inventa una macchia sulla camicetta della cassiera per umiliarla dopo l\u2019acida e pettegola uscita dell\u2019impiegata), avrebbe eliminato lo scambio tra Ruth e Addie, dove ci viene spiegato quanto abbiamo appena letto, compreso, e apprezzato proprio per la sottigliezza, la precisione, e l\u2019understatement.Poi, per\u00f2, c\u2019\u00e8 anche da dire che ritrovare Haruf \u00e8 come andare in bicicletta, se hai pedalato da piccolo, saprai farlo per tutta la vita: ho ritrovato il suo stile e il suo passo da subito, ho potuto attraversare una lunga notte insieme ad Haruf. Mi sono immerso in queste due anime di settantenni, con pregi e difetti, convessit\u00e0 e concavit\u00e0, spigoli e accoglienza.Scrivere sembra facile, quando leggo Haruf: le sue sono parole che mi viene da definire giuste, precise, essenziali, semplici. Dell\u2019inizio molto bello ho gi\u00e0 detto. E anche dopo continua a essere bello, le reazioni bigotte del paese (Holt, sempre quello), che crede Addie e Louis amanti, mentre loro due sono ancora nella fase di avvicinamento ed esplorazione, hanno (momentaneamente) messo da parte il sesso.Per me le cose si sono guastate con l\u2019arrivo del nipotino: l\u2019attenzione di Haruf si sposta sul bambino, e con lui la mia di lettore, che invece voleva restare legata alla coppia di anziani. E con lo scorrere delle (poche) pagine \u00e8 purtroppo salito il mio tasso glicemico di lettore, alla fine l\u2019eccesso di carineria mi ha soffocato.E adesso parla con me. Dimmi qualcosa che non ho ancora mai sentito.Robert Redford-Louis e Jane Fonda-Addie passeggiano sulla Main Street di Holt nel filmTV Netflix.Il film, ovviamente, da una parte perde qualcosa rispetto al libro, dall\u2019altra guadagna: per esempio, l\u2019imbattibile meraviglia di vedere ancora una volta sullo schermo due leggende come Jane Fonda e Robert Redford, insieme per la quarta volta, dopo La caccia, A piedi nudi nel parco, Il cavaliere elettrico, splendidi ottantenni, con quasi sessanta anni di carriera alle spalle, interpreti del cinema che ho amato di pi\u00f9.Guadagna anche la trama, il racconto sembra filare pi\u00f9 del romanzo, sembra pi\u00f9 lineare.Se per un verso il bel personaggio minore di Ruth sullo schermo \u00e8 solo un\u2019apparizione che non lascia il segno, il figlio di Addie, invece, \u00e8 rivalutato rispetto alla pagina, meno schematico, pi\u00f9 rotondo, forse anche grazie alla scelta dell\u2019attore belga Matthias Schoenaerts (Hollywood, al contrario del resto del paese, non ha muri, mai come in questi ultimi anni, gli attori stranieri hanno porte aperte).Purtroppo, il film Netflix \u00e8 decisamente di confezione e taglio televisivi: rari campi lunghi, per lo pi\u00f9 campi medi visto che i protagonisti sono due star ag\u00e9, campo e controcampo, luce smorzata e pastellosa per non far risaltare le rughe, ma anche senza nessun fascino.Attori leggendari.Sam Brewster"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie", "userReview": "As you\u2019d expect from an author who knows he is dying this is a tremendously wise novel about the pursuit of everyday happiness and all the petty and ingrained obstructions such a pursuit can meet when it\u2019s unconventional.

I love this physical life with you. And the air and the country. The backyard, the gravel in the back alley. The grass. The cool nights. Lying in bed talking with you in the dark.\"These simple yet sublime words expressed between two lonely souls managed to evoke such a feeling of peace in me. Addie and Louis, both widowed for some time, wish only to spend the remainder of their lives in companionship and quiet pleasure. What more can we really ask for in this life that is sometimes filled with hardships and heartache? This is my second Kent Haruf novel and there is no doubt in my mind that this gifted man understood people. With a straightforward yet elegant style, Haruf manages to convey the heart of his characters. Even in this short piece of fiction we discern the innermost hopes, fears and desires of Addie and Louis. I adored Addie's little grandson - his love for his dog and his curiosity about the baby mice. I thought their neighbor, Ruth, would be just another busybody but came to appreciate her clever advice to Addie \u2013 she managed to make me laugh! And then there were the gossips and the \"bucket dippers\" as my daughter would say. Why can't folks just leave well enough alone? Addie's son Carl with his heaping pile of baggage grated on my last nerve and I simply could not grasp why he was so opposed to Louis and Addie's gentle and unimposing relationship. I won't give away the last 4 sentences of this little gem, but let me just say they were quite poignant and clearly bittersweet. I highly recommend Our Souls at Night and Haruf's Plainsong which I liked even better than this. They will make you think about humanity and those things that matter the most to you. Hearing about catastrophes and senseless killings, I want to stop and think about living each day the best that I can and appreciating the basic and happiest things in life \u2013 my family, long summer nights, the tinkling of the wind chimes outside my door, my daughter's extra kisses and \"neck\" hugs, the sound of my son whistling, the taste of root beer floats, my teetering stack of books, and slow dancing with my love, just to name a few of those things for which I am most grateful. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "Stop for a moment and take stock of the simple things in life.

The excitement of meeting again the familiar, direct but warm style of Haruf\u2019s unpretentious writing sent me soaring cloud high at first, but as the story of Addie and Louis evolved and those closer to them, those who should have shown more empathy and understanding for their situation, betrayed them for incomprehensible reasons, I became impatient and somewhat infuriated by the sheer levity with which Haruf treated these wrongdoings.This book lacks the inner light that shines in the Plainsong trilogy that is imbedded in the essential goodness of people who suspend judgment in order to help each other. This work is more skeptical of that community sentiment and it highlights the selfishness of adult sons and daughters towards their elderly parents. Two widowed neighbors decide to act against their prolonged loneliness and start a relationship that has all the village gossiping about them. Addie and Louis have lived too much to care about the opinion of others, but when Addie\u2019s son Gene interferes in his mother\u2019s life, first by demanding her to take care of his son while he tries to sort out his ruined marriage, and later, by forbidding her to carry on with her affair with Louis, my indignation almost made me stop reading.Begrudgingly, I read until the last page and a huge sadness invaded me. And many questions. What if there is a huge lesson to learn from this story? Could I act like Gene one day? Am I really free of the kind of prejudice that urges Gene to act so unfairly with his elderly mother?Haruf writes about a sorrowful reality that is too common without taboos. He unflinchingly addresses the loneliness of elderly people and their lack of freedom to do what they want with what is left of their lives. Used as their children see fit while it\u2019s convenient for them, and then discarded and treated like toddlers, they are deprived of their last shred of dignity and denied their wishes \u201cfor their own good\u201d. Such condescendence, such injustice shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Read this book and resolve to write a different ending if one of your parents ever becomes the protagonist of this story.

A book like Our Souls at Night may not offer a groundbreaking plot but this bittersweet novella will leave you with a sense of tranquility and calmness. Addie Moore and Louis Waters are neighbours, in their 70s, living in Haruf's fictional town called Holt. They are both widowed and mere acquaintances. One day, Addie approaches Louis and asks if he would spend some nights with her, to just have someone to talk at nights, to have a companion, and hence the name Our Souls at Night. Addie and Louis start spending nights together, they share their aching past, broken relationships and the people they have loved and lost. One significant character, Jamie, Addie's grandson, enters their life and makes the story even more beautiful. Under the bedcovers and darkness of night, their relationship grows gracefully and they both immensely value each other's presence in their lives. A lot of things happen in the course of the story; people gossip and pry, family discord even force them to end their relationship. Our Souls At Night is a transcendent ode to aging. It was Kent Haruf's last book and it was published posthumously. I picked this book without giving it any thought and it was my first time reading Kent Haruf, it definitely won't be my last. His writing is direct and moving, it is simple yet profound. This was an odd little book from an obscure writer who poignantly captured the emotions of two old people, their loneliness, their need to have a confidant, a hand to hold, and a person to just talk to when it gets difficult to get through the night. I finished the book and I wept, I just sat in my room and wept. He is a writer that will invoke so many feelings in you with his simple and subtle words. I am so glad I stumbled upon this book. I highly recommend it.I watched the movie as soon as I finished the book, and it was not as good. It was not as honest and sensitive as the book.

By reading this book, I knew I would have to do it. So I postponed and postponed. And postponed. But today was the day and I closed this book weeping. Kent Haruf wrote his final book - a short one, taking his readers with him through the ending of time, and his last capture of friendship and companionship between two elderly people who tried for one last time to enjoy the love they never had and face the loneliness that claimed their nights. As usual he took his readers into the magic of his fictional town, Holt, and invited us to experience the grace, sweetness and dignity of life in better times, when people still had honor, and men were men and women women. When different rules drove the narrative of marriage and small town living. And kindness walked hand in hand with mutual respect and understanding. They did not have lily white lives, they just handled the consequences of their choices differently. Life left good and bad memories, but they were wise enough to know what was important in the end.By closing the book I felt deprived of Kent Haruf, good writing and good stories. I will miss his gentleness, his gentleman -ess. I can only take the good memories and make it part of my life for now. What an honor it was to discover this author's work. It changed my life.

This book and I just aren\u2019t a good fit. Books keep teaching me things about what I like and don\u2019t like. This book taught me I just don't do quiet, simplistic, low-key. I guess I'm just a drama queen, liking my stories over the top. And I apparently don't like small town settings. Give me city, give me nuts! I like complicated over simplistic, no doubt because I make everything way too complicated :)I had a problem with the premise: I had trouble believing anyone would invite a stranger to bed instead of to coffee. Bed seems too personal a space to share with the unfamiliar. Would anyone seriously invite a stranger to share snoring, restlessness, bumping, sleep machines, and all the other embarrassing sounds and sights that are part of the night? And would anyone accept? I know I'm just analyzing it too much. But this is realistic fiction and I just don\u2019t find the premise realistic.The idea of committing to learn about a stranger is intriguing, maybe, say, if they sat at a table and had some coffee cups, as barriers, between them. Once I suspend disbelief, it's not a bad little story. I know and appreciate that this book is near and dear to many, but it's just not my cup of tea.

I am one of them. My Grannie was a widow for 15 years, met Gramps at a church outing and they married about 2 months after Grannie\u2019s 70th birthday. Grannie was a joy in our lives \u2013 lots of stories, songs, and best of all for me, a wonderful correspondent. She was my most faithful pen pal for years. Gramps was about a year and half younger than Grannie and she would tease us about her marrying a \u2018younger man\u2019.Gramps was a gentleman and a gentle man. I remember how he would tuck her arm in his and walk on the outside of the sidewalk; how he would always pull out her chair and seat her at meal times; how he was unfailingly polite, respectful, and loving toward her. Gramps didn\u2019t drive, but Grannie drove until she was 90. Gramps would always open the driver\u2019s door and ensure Grannie was settled before going around to the passenger\u2019s seat. They had their 26th Wedding Anniversary in July and a couple of months later, Gramps died with Grannie following him in December. Our families loved them both and I still think of them and miss them at times.Reading Kent Haruf\u2019s last novel, \u201cOur Souls at Night\u201d, was different yet it recalled to mind many aspects of Grannie and Gramps\u2019 lives together. Addie Moore, 70, is a widow and Louis Waters, a widower. They have lived in the same small town for several decades and knew each other, their spouses, and their children.Addie and Louis are both lonely and they come together to talk, sharing their stories from the past, musing on the town\u2019s people and events, and going on outings together.

This straightforward story tells of two folks in their seventies who decide they\u2019re not going to succumb to loneliness because of social mandates. Haruf\u2019s writing is the antithesis of flowery. It\u2019s direct, but it\u2019s still moving. I loved Addie from the first sentence of the novel. And Louis, too. They\u2019re folks who admit the mistakes they\u2019ve made. \u201cI believe there are failures of character, like I said before. That\u2019s a sin.\u201dThe conflict in the book involves how others perceive Addie and Louis, especially their children. And for whom we are willing to sacrifice our happiness.

Adele and Lewis, lived in the same town, the same neighborhood for most of their married lives. At the age of seventy both have now lost their spouses. But does, this mean they most join the ranks of the lonely, backward looking, no future to look forward to, or can they do something about it. Of course small towns are notorious for gossip, some who love to do nothing but criticize and make sure others, close to the couple know exactly what is going on.Loved this story, so much hope, little joys and sorrows shared, just the fact that regardless of age there can be a future, one need not just give up and live only in the past. Such a powerful message, so tenderly and respectfully rendered. In the last quarter there is a little surprise, a bit of author's whimsy shall we say, but only those familiar with his other books will understand and grin.Both sincere and wonderful this last book, shorter than his others , but still imparting every day's wisdom and challenges.

Kent Haruf has a way of doing that. In spare, unadorned yet poignant language, he gets right to the heart of things, capturing succinctly what makes us feel most human.This last novella-sized work, posted posthumously and written just months before his death of lung cancer at age 71, is particularly affecting. In other hands, this narrative might have been maudlin: a septuagenarian widow, Addie Moore, reaches out to her neighbor, widower Louis Waters, with a simple request: to lie together in bed, companionably, and talk in the dark to ward off the loneliness. Gradually, their lives are laid bare to each other \u2013 their dreams and disappointments, their hopes and compromises, and everything that composes the tapestry of an individual life.When Addie\u2019s young grandson, Jamie, comes to stay with Addie temporarily, heir relationship both deepens and is tested. I\u2019ll say no more about the plot; it enfolds so naturally, beautifully and yet heartbreakingly that each reader must come to it on his or her own.I will say this: Kent Haruf had a way of expressing what is true and what is important. Addie says, \u201cI just want to live simply and pay attention to what\u2019s happening each day;. And come sleep with you at night.\u201d And at another point: \u201cI do love this physical world.

Her husband died years ago, as did his wife, and in such a small town they naturally have known of each other for decades; in fact, Addie was quite fond of Louis's wife. His daughter lives hours away in Colorado Springs, her son even farther away in Grand Junction, and Addie and Louis have long been living alone in houses now empty of family, the nights so terribly lonely, especially with no one to talk with.
