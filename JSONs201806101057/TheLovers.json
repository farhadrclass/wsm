Her destination is Datca, the place where decades before she spent her honeymoon. As Turkey is the \u2018land where archaeologists came and were startled to find entire town as they once were\u2019, she expects to find things exactly as she left them all those years ago, so she can re-enact the happy times of the early days of her marriage. Something, she convinced herself, that would help the mourning process which, for now, was going extremely slowly. Sadly, she arrives in a town that is barely a shadow of its former self. It fell into decay and its previous glory is another thing on the list of things Yvonne has to mourn.The first half of the book is full of lengthy inner monologues and banal observations that we have to sit through while waiting for Yvonne\u2019s grief to take on more shape and meaning. So we read things like: \u201cThere was nothing sadder, Yvonne thought, than seeing an old man\u2019s underwear.\u201dReally? How about clubbing baby seals?Or: \u201cShe walked around, enjoying the sound the sandals made on the tile floor. The sound of elegance, she thought. The sound of a woman preparing for a party.\u201dAnd so it goes, my friends, it\u2019s like being stuck in a boring person\u2019s head. Nonetheless, it reads smoothly, if only you are willing to overlook bizarre things like: \u201cShe lifted her fingers to her own face, and only then did she know she had been crying.\u201dI have seen this in books a few times and it doesn\u2019t cease to baffle me. Just how can you not know you are crying? Has this happened to anyone in real life?Amidst this questionable writing we learn about Yvonne\u2019s relationship with her two children and her late husband. We also witness her befriending an ex-wife of her temporary Turkish landlord and a Turkish boy who sells shells on the beach. One these two new found friends will serve as catalyst to a much needed breakthrough for Yvonne and the book itself. From then on the novel takes on a more surreal tone. It becomes deep, hot and stuffy. The emotions come across as more authentic and the writing, too, seems to be less cringe-worthy. The events gain momentum and lead up to a dramatic (if slightly far-fetched) finale.I didn\u2019t fall in love with The Lovers and this book and I should probably start seeing other people. However, I am certain that it will appeal to the fans of detailed introspection set in exotic lands; this, I hear, is Vida\u2019s speciality.(originally published on bookmunch.wordpress.com)"}, {"userName": "Betsy Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149179-betsy-robinson", "userReview": "This is a slow, meandering, and emotionally disjointed story of a woman who has recently become a widow. The meandering quality is because the descriptions and sequence of them felt like a travelogue; a woman travels from Burlington, Vermont, to Turkey, and within Turkey, to the place of her honeymoon, to Konya (Rumi\u2019s hometown), and to other smaller towns. Toward the end (page 211 of 225 pages), we are reminded that she has taken this journey because she is trying to recapture something from decades earlier, and then the list of events is recapped, culminating in the admission that she is lost. I almost felt as if I were reading the details of a well-researched trip, reported as they were observed\u2014like travel notes in a journal, with no story in mind. In fact, it felt as if the story was superimposed on travel notes and the writer was a little lost about what she was attempting. For me, further disjointedness came from many emotional transitions that didn\u2019t feel organic, a seemingly endless supply of money funding this trip that was never explained (the protagonist is a teacher), and a completely unbelievable ending. In other words, there were many aspects of this story that didn\u2019t feel real, yet it also didn\u2019t feel surreal or like a dream.Nevertheless, the writing is nice.I read this book because it was immediately available at my library and the two books by Vida that Goodreads friends had raved about were not.

She is there to spend some time alone before meeting up with her twin adult children \u2013 her troubled and addicted daughter Aurelia and her \u201cperfect\u201d son Matthew \u2013 for a cruise.An aura of menace with wisps of sexual tension pervades most of the novel. The vacation home is spotless and lovely, but traces of an active sex life are everywhere: a sex swing, nude photographs, and a book with a particularly erotic title. Worse, the town is shadier and not quite the way Yvonne remembers it. She also begins getting visits from the vacation home owner\u2019s estranged wife Ozlem, who fills her with tales of her husband\u2019s unfaithfulness and abuse\u2026and tales of her own shaky morals.There is just one respite for Yvonne: a young 10-year-old Turkish boy \u2013 a shell collector, who metaphorically collects beautiful fossils, not unlike Yvonne herself. He awakens feelings of protectiveness in Yvonne and harkens her back to a more innocent time when her twins were young. Until tragedy strikes again\u2026There is strong writing on display here. Yvonne \u2013 who relies on the company of strangers \u2013 finds out that strangers can hurt. There\u2019s a searing flashback to leaving her husband\u2019s memorial service only to find a note room a stranger instructing her to be \u201cless selfish\u201d because of her poor parking job. Time after time, people Yvonne meets end up hurting her \u2013 inadvertently and advertently. As a waiter who is witness to her budding friendship with Ahmed says, \u201cNot all of us are so eager to be your friend.\u201dThe interweaving of grief, lies, and loss, and redemption is explored in a subtle yet satisfying manner, as Yvonne goes on her Joseph Campbell-style \u201cheroine\u2019s journey\u201d to gain a truer sense of self and more honest memories. The metaphors can sometimes get too heavy-handed: an owl that appears in her room, for example, or entering into a cave and then not being able to find a path. And the ending is a tad too rushed and pat and, in this reader\u2019s opinion, is the weakest part of the book.Yet despite these flaws, the Lovers is still a fascinating and atmospheric exploration into how we go away (sometimes even from our inner core) to find ourselves once again.

I tried to think of a better book in all the world over, and failed. I sighed a lot. The music of REO Speedwagon finally made sense to me.What I should have done: Chased it with something completely different from a different section of the bookstore. A food memoir, travel essays, or lousy vampire fiction.What I did do: Chased it with Vida's book. Climbed right back into a piece of contemporary fiction. Stupid. STUPID.The end result wasn't pretty. \"The Lovers\" is probably a better book than I think it is, in light of where it fell on my reading list. It unwittingly became the block of Velveeta you are forced to consume when you finish the $40 chunk of brie, but still need a taste of cheese. Yvonne is zeroing in on her twilight years. The school teacher's husband died tragically two years earlier, and she has adult children, twins with very different lives. Matthew is a success, with a fancy pants fiance and a cool job. Aurelia is a recovering addict who tormented the family through her teen years, with her in and out of rehab bit.Matthew has invited Yvonne to go on a cruise with his fiance's family, but instead she decides to travel to a small town in Turkey where she and her husband had honeymooned a zillion years ago. She'll catch her son during a leg of his trip, but mostly try to recapture her own sense of adventure with this solo gig. Yvonne's got an itch to reclaim the sense of adventure she had when she was young.Times have been tough. Yvonne feels like she is on everyone's watch list, and during the past school year she presented the same lecture, word for word, twice in the same week.She's a bit out of her element in Datca, where she rents a house from a possibly abusive man. While roaming the space, she finds a book about anal sex, a nudie photograph, and a sex swing. She makes friends with the man's wife, a young and colorful woman with a lot of bad ideas and a pregnancy of questionable origin. She makes enemies with a waiter. She is a little scared of the landlord. She meets a young sea shell seller named Ahmet, who doesn't speak English, and they fall into an easy, albeit silent friendship.But instead of being a healing trip, per se, Yvonne spirals toward her emotional breaking point -- helped along by a whack tragedy that pages later is still a head scratcher of an event.Vida's novel feels a lot like an Anne Tyler creation, with its quaint thises and thats. The defining moments of the book are kind of snoozers. In one, Yvonne drives her rental along a freshly tarred road and ruins the exterior of the car; In another, an owl gets trapped in the house, which is seemingly an omen. A very obvious omen. There is also a boat ride with new friends during bad weather. Yawn. Yawn, double yawn. There is also a lot of introspection about her family life back home. Yvonne spends so much time thinking about her husband Peter, weighing their relationship and what it was worth, and the struggles with Aurelia and how that affected them all.Maybe under different circumstances I would have found this book beautiful and light. A pleasant read about a woman popping her emotional bubble. But under the circumstances of cracking it immediately after finishing the epic piece of awesome that is \"A Visit from the Goon Squad,\" \"The Lovers\" felt dull and uninspired."}, {"userName": "Malena Watrous", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2925839-malena-watrous", "userReview": "I like Vendela Vida's writing a lot. It's pared down to the essentials, with a great forward momentum--even when the characters are privately mulling over the past, as Yvonne is in this book. I like how she captures the surrealism of ordinary details--white freckles on a man's arms, a hotel room in a cave, a woman who only arranges her face so that she looks beautiful when she knows she's being looked at. I agree with those who say that she writes in the vein of Paul Bowles--these travel novels at least--showing people journeying abroad in order to journey inward. She can get at her characters' interiority while mostly staying focused on what they're experiencing on the outside, which I admire. I found this book hard to put down, which I appreciate (especially since I've been a bit distracted lately). Like others, I'm mixed on the ending. Halfway through the book, I'd decided that the backstory involving the daughter, and why she'd turned to alcohol and drugs from such a young age, was dark in a way that Yvonne herself hadn't recognized yet, but that she would by the end. This didn't happen, and I can't decide if I'm relieved or not."}, {"userName": "Jennie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1228496-jennie", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book, since I loved my time in Turkey.

Her husband has died in a horrific hit-and-run car accident; their children, twins Matt and Aurelia, are grown now, but Aurelia's teenage years and on were riddled with drug and alcohol abuse, filled with lies and deceptions and stints in rehab. Yvonne returns to Datca in Turkey where she and her husband had spent their honeymoon in hopes of returning to memories that don't involve death and dishonesty while at the same time desiring to find herself again.The thing with memories, however, is that they don't go away. Even when you go across the world and immerse yourself in another culture, your past follows you there.We learn about Yvonne's past through her memories and conversations with others in Datca and the surrounding towns. It's a sad story, particularly the relationship between Yvonne and her daughter. Yvonne wants to be able to trust her daughter again, and wants to reconnect, but Aurelia's past isn't easy to forget.I saw a review where someone gave this book 3 stars, and the explanation was that it was a good story but a little \"depressing\". My 3 stars are not because it was depressing (is that really a legitimate reason to knock off a star?) but because I felt the ending was rushed. It's easy to sit down and read this book in a couple of sittings - it's not a difficult read, and Yvonne's experiences are recognizable - but all of a sudden it was done. I feel even a few extra pages could have made a difference.But I was taken away to Turkey. Vida's writing of scenery and description is impressive - I felt myself following Yvonne around Datca and I was able to put myself in Yvonne's shoes, something that isn't always easy. This is the first book by Vida I've read but certainly won't be the last. I won't even hold it against her that she's married to Dave Eggers.

Like Let The Northern Lights Erase Your Name, the writing is simple yet illuminating, picturesque prose especially exemplified as her settings seem to be lesser popularized travel destinations. Here she has her heroine, Yvonne, in Turkey, including Datca, Istanbul, Konya, Kronos; the most mesmerizing being those near the water as she spends time with Ahmet. It is a story of self-discovery. A story about marriage, love, motherhood. Forgiveness, guilt, regret. The past merging with the present. Learning from this to better her relationship with herself as well as her children. She specifically chose luxurious, resplendent Turkey because it was the destination of her honeymoon almost twenty-five years ago. The plan is to remember her late husband Peter, then meet her children Aurelia & Matthew a few weeks later. Unfortunately, sometimes one's memories are not as comforting as one wishes; we remember only what we want to for a reason... To further complicate things is her friendship with a young Turkish boy she meets on the beach where he collects seashells. He reminds her of her children; he fills the void of loneliness, her need to caretake rather than unveil her own worries, something she is forced to do as the friendship soon ends in tragedy.

It is a multi-layered story about Yvonne, a widow, who returns to Turkey where she and her husband once honeymooned. She believes that by returning to the same place where they had been together early in her marriage, she will feel closer to him. Her husband Peter was recently killed in a hit and run car accident in their hometown of Burlington, Vermont. Yvonne has rented a large home, sight unseen, for a couple of weeks until she is scheduled to meet up with her son and daughter and their partners on a boating trip.Yvonne is an aging woman who is a history teacher. Recently, she has had some troubles in the classroom. For instance, she presented a class about Cromwell twice in the same week. She knows that she is floundering, that her center is gone, but she does not know how to get it back. Perhaps, she thinks, this trip to Turkey will help her.While in Turkey, odd things happen to her. Yvonne is renting a home that belongs to her landlord's lover. Ozlem, the wife of Ali, the man from whom she is renting, appears one day and begins a friendship with Yvonne. Ozlem is fraught with her own problems. She is not sure whether she wants to leave Ali and she is violently jealous of Ali's affair. Ozlem is also pregnant but not sure if Ali is the father.Yvonne has two children, Aurelia and Matthew. Matthew has been good at everything since she was a child and Aurelia has been a drug addict, in and out of rehab a good many times. This trip they are all planning to take is to be a pre-wedding trip for Matthew and Yvonne is fearful that some catastrophic event will happen with Aurelia before the trip commences. Aurelia's drug addiction had caused a lot of friction between Yvonne and Peter during their marriage.Yvonne likes to drive to the beach. While there, she meets a young boy who sells sea shells. Yvonne strikes up a friendship with him and commissions him to find shells for her. She looks at him as one would a new-found possibility, a friendship or child that is a tabla rasa. She begins to endow him with qualities that he doesn't really possess but that she needs him to have.Throughout her time in Turkey, which is fraught with panic, eerie circumstances, and darkness, Yvonne looks back on her marriage and tries to find the truth of what it really was. As she progresses in finding the truth, she becomes first weaker and then gains strength. She realizes that her marriage was not what she thought it was and that she is not really the woman she thought she was in her relationship. She sadly realizes that \"these were two of her strengths: changing the subject and feigning ignorance.\" She also realizes how very strong her love for her daughter is.I found the book mesmerizing. The plot alone is enough to carry the book along but the atmospheric suspense makes it even more present and portentous. This book is a sensory experience, at times subtle like watching fish swim in a small pond. At other times, it feels like you are in the eye of the hurricane."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane", "userReview": "As a huge fan of this author's last book: Let the Northern Lights Erase Your Name, I was very excited to read Vida's latest novel, The Lovers.Like in her last novel, this story is about a woman on an emotional journey, traveling far from home to find herself and meaning in her life. Yvonne is a 53 year old woman, mother of adult twins: Matthew and Auerelia. She lost her husband Peter, two years earlier and is still numb from the loss. She is tired of having everyone still asking how she is doing, so she convinces herself she is fine, but her actions show us she is not. Yvonne's son, his fiancee and her family are cruising the Mediterranean on a chartered yacht, and she has agreed to met them in Turkey. Yvonne heads out for Datca Turkey, nine days before they are to meet up, where she has rented a home. This is the place where she and her husband Peter had honeymooned 28 years earlier. She is hoping that reliving happier times in her past will help ease her grief.From her arrival at the airport the reader can glean that things will not go as planned. On her own, she puts herself in some unsafe situations. The town is not at all how she remembered it.:\"The beach was filthy. Small plastic bags, gelatinous in the sun, had been deposited by the tide on the wet sand. Dark, dead leaves swirled and settled around a boat that looked like it had docked on the beach five years before, and never left. The water too looked dirty, the foam of the small waves that crashed on the beach the color of beer. The promenade itself was not half as populated as she remembered it. The short trees bordering the walkway provided little shade and had rooted themselves under the cement, creating small hills and crevices. From somewhere in the trees came the eerie daytime hooting of owls.\"\" Half the restaurants had been shut down. The remaining ones displayed sick-looking fish on beds of crushed gray ice. With soiled rags, waiters shooed away mangy cats trolling for food. A sprinkling of tourists speaking German sat outside cafes', their skin sunburned to a peculiar shade of orange.\"The highlights of Yvonne's days are meeting up with little boy who sells seashells. He does not speak English. She spends time thinking about her life and her relationship with her children, especially Auerelia, who she had a strained relationship with, as she spent years in and out of rehab.The Lovers is a story that reminds the reader how life is very much a journey. The ending gave me hope that Yvonne would be able to move on. Regardless of your age, I think many readers will be able to connect with Yvonne, as I did. The writing is sparse but reflective, and the pages of this short 225 novel turned quickly.

Instead of the cold glow of the Arctic Circle that defined Let The Northern Lights Erase Your Name, Ms. Vida bathes the protagonist of The Lovers, Yvonne, in the cerulean blue of the Turkish Riviera. Ms. Vida writes so deftly and with such elegance. You are given just the right depth of detail to create your own vision of setting and character and the just enough tension to keep you on your emotional edge. This story sagged in the behavior of Yvonne, the recently-widowed history teacher who returns to the tiny Turkish village of Datca, the site of her honeymoon some thirty years before. She travels there in an attempt to evoke memories of her husband and the romance of their marriage that she has lost in a period of too-public mourning. Yvonne exasperated me. Perhaps it was her grief that caused her to behave with an uncharacteristic stumbling impulsiveness. Her social naivete and clumsiness, the long stares behind the facade of the perfect marriage, the wayward daughter and the creepily-perfect son were way too Anne Tyler/Joyce Carol Oates for me. Yet, in contrast to these overly-sympathetic authors, I felt like Vida was laughing a bit at her protagonist. In this regard, The Lovers lacks the resonance of ...Northern Lights....

First let me say that there was a lot that I liked about this book, especially at the beginning. I liked the premise: widowed Yvonne, a school teacher, goes to Turkey, which is where she and her husband had gone on their honeymoon, 20-something years earlier. I also was very fond of Yvonne; I found her interesting, sympathetic, with compelling personal problems to work on during this trip. And I really liked Vida's prose, which balances descriptive travel imagery and psychologically intriguing interior monologues. Now for the things I didn't like. As the book progressed, I grew increasingly dismayed at the protagonist's behavior and choices, and the author's preoccupation with problems that seemed to be more plot-ploy than believable. Plus, a little past halfway, I started to suspect that there wasn't going to be any resolution to Yvonne's issues from her own strength of character, and in fact there might be dissolution. Dissolution would have been fine as an outcome except for one thing: the series of events didn't hold together. The plot turns got extremely unbelievable and the metaphors got heavy-handed. At one point, Yvonne is lost in a dark catacomb, racing towards the exit. That was how I felt at that point in the book: I was in a dark place, racing towards the end.

There is no shallow resolution here, but the sometimes cold and hard facts of realistic life, and the emotions of a woman just getting through each day.

She's trying to escape her life in Vermont, and her new status as the pitied single woman among couples. As the mother of grown twins, she is conflicted with her memories of her marriage and her relationship with her children. She's discovering that as more time passes since her husband's death, the more she is forced to re-evaluate their relationship.After describing lush and green Vermont, the description of Turkey provides a stark contrast with dust, stones, and volcanic mountains. It's a none-too-subtle hint that with a new setting in place, things are going to change. But are they? This is where the novel makes a twist: nothing you think is going to happen actually happens. Once in place, she craves the company of others, so much so that she puts up with the imposition of others just to have human contact. Eventually, this leads her to a realization about her own personality and her own future. To be sure, this is not a romantic or happily-ever-after \"chick\" lit story. It is not Eat Love Pray, and there's no glamour, sudden insight, or handsome distraction. Rather, Yvonne, is very much alone and really has no basis to understand who she was, or is. If she's different, then it means her perceptions of her husband and children are altered too, and that's where her story becomes less typical and more interesting. In fact, the title \"The Lovers\" is misleading...it's not easy to determine who that would describe. It doesn't take long for her to realize she's been playing a role, but she has no other script to turn to...she doesn't quite know how to behave anymore. I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but as the plot continues, she is so disoriented that her decisions become riskier and more dangerous. Rather than feature shocking revelations or dramatic confrontations, the novel proceeds to a realistic conclusion. Rather than settle for a shallow resolution, the novel leaves you to ponder deeper complexities of personality and self.The story is fast paced, and as a main character, Yvonne is solid. But her children remain a mystery, and it's hard to grasp how they fit in with it all. Additionally, in the beginning there are hints as to the direction of the story that are misleading, and really weren't necessary at all. The book didn't need those elements to mystify us, her story alone is strong enough without them. And while the main character is female, the appeal of the plot isn't limited to a female audience.There was one seeming discrepancy: this sheltered woman has put herself in a foreign country, alone, without even a guidebook to the language. She is suspicious at times of others, and rightfully so, as malice is present, and yet she makes no great attempt to lock up her vacation rental or show any sense of caution in her actions. She's throwing euros around as tips, and everyone seems to know she's alone. Unexpected visitors, with their own keys, seem to pop up constantly, and yet she takes it all in stride. That seemed a bit out of character from how she was described, but it's a small complaint."}, {"userName": "Rebekah O'Dell", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/138010-rebekah-o-dell", "userReview": "Vida\u2019s novel opens with Yvonne, a middle-aged widow, lost and looking for her driver in a Turkish airport. Vacationing alone in an attempt to recapture the magic of her honeymoon in Turkey twenty-six years before, lost is how Yvonne spends most of the novel, metaphorically speaking.  While her husband was killed in a car accident years before, this is Yvonne\u2019s first trip without him. Even though the reader hears stories about Yvonne\u2019s life at home in Vermont, it feels to the reader as though this is Yvonne\u2019s first trip out of the house at all without Peter. She seems incredibly fragile and somehow unable to fully cope with the activities of daily life. She is wholly unmoored.The Turkey that Yvonne finds upon her arrival is not the same Turkey of her youth. Like Yvonne, Turkey is weathered and decayed. It is the physical emblem of the grief that cripples her. Yvonne rents a house from a successful businessman and becomes entangled in his marital problems when his wife, Ozlem, becomes a frequent visitor at the house. \u201cEntangled\u201d is actually a very apt word for Yvonne\u2019s experience in Turkey as she also becomes deeply entangled in a friendship with a local boy who sells shells. While it is entirely innocent \u2014 and really a way for Yvonne to connect to her children by proxy \u2014 a local waiter and the boy\u2019s grandmother clearly express their skepticism and disapproval. This constant juxtaposition of isolation and connection pervades the text.I could not stop turning the pages as I read. Beyond some very tightly woven motifs about marriage, decay, and grief, the formal structure of the novel also fascinated me. Without chapters and clocking in at only 240 pages (and it felt shorter!), I found myself thinking of The Lovers as a novella \u2014 somehow denser and more punch-packing than a differently-paced novel separated into sections. This decision also affected the pacing of the story \u2014 causing me to read faster and faster, mimicking the out-of-control spiral in which Yvonne finds herself.The only problem I had with this book at all was the title \u2014 why The Lovers? Obviously, this is a love story between Yvonne and the memory of her husband. While their marriage was far from perfect, the power of her grief and the tenderness of her memories conveys a different kind of passion but passion nonetheless. Ozlem and Ali, the house\u2019s owner, also take separate lovers and spend the novel working out the terms of their relationship as lovers. And Yvonne sees honeymooners everywhere. I would love to know why Vida chose this title to encapsulate Yvonne\u2019s story.This is a really beautiful book \u2014 a short and fulfilling read. It\u2019s the quiet kind of book that not everyone will like \u2014 there is little action other than wandering around Turkey and while the ending is surprising, it\u2019s not the kind of surprise that most readers might expect. For me, this book is an unexpected triumph."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill", "userReview": "In The Lovers, Yvonne, 53, travels from her home in Burlington, Vermont to the Turkish town of Dat\u00e7a where she spent her honeymoon with her husband Peter, killed two years earlier in a hit-and-run accident. She was hoping to come to terms with the truth of her marriage - especially to remember again the happiness that characterized it at the beginning, and to emerge from the catatonic state in which she has been since Peter\u2019s death:\"\u2026she had come to Dat\u00e7a to strip herself of these lies, to shed this grief. The grief and the lies were the same - one begot the other.\u201dShe finds that the small town of Dat\u00e7a had deteriorated, analogous to the way her marriage had. Much of the conflict between Yvonne and Peter was over their twins, Matthew and Aurelia. Matthew was \u201cperfect\u201d and the one on whom Peter bestowed his favor. Aurelia was damaged, subject to alcohol and drug addiction, and Peter seemed to blame Yvonne. Even when the children grew up and left the house, \u201cthey had grown so accustomed to resenting each other that they didn\u2019t know how to stop.\u201dIn Turkey Yvonne encounters some rather eccentric people, such as the estranged wife \u00d6zlem of her proprietor; a local boy Ahmet who sells seashells to her; Ahmet\u2019s sister; and another vacationing American couple. All of them serve to give insights about herself to Yvonne.Eventually, Yvonne gets some answers about her life, but they weren\u2019t answers to the questions she came with; she had been blinded all along by the wrong questions.Discussion: This is a short novel, with spare but well-crafted writing. The primary theme seems to be the way in which we define ourselves through our relationships, and how these ideas of who we are and who the others are in our lives may get embedded in old patterns - almost like those paperweights of insects stuck in amber, that then go on to hold down our growth in the same fixed and stuck way. In addition, these definitions affect the evaluations of us by others; how does one escape such enmeshment? In the biggest metaphor of the book, an owl, bereft of its mate (owls are monogamous), becomes trapped in the house which Yvonne is renting. The owl eventually gets loose; whether Yvonne does too remains to be seen.Evaluation: This is a thought-provoking meditation on sense of self and the importance of relationships to one\u2019s identity. The characters struck me as rather odd though; I didn't really warm up to them. Moreover, some of the plot developments are sort of enigmatic and/or get dropped. In addition, I found the ending to be a bit improbable. Nevertheless, I would recommend it for a book club, because it would definitely generate discussion."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2870736-amy", "userReview": "I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher.In the aftermath of her husband's death, grieving widow Yvonne travels to Turkey where she and her husband had honeymooned 28 years before. Her plan is to spend some time alone reflecting on her marriage and the loss of her husband and then meeting up with her adult twins for a cruise. Her plans become complicated when she quickly becomes entangled in the lives of several people. She uncovers secrets about the man she is renting a house from. She becomes friends with the man's wife and forms an unlikely bond with her. She befriends an elderly woman who runs a yacht service with her husband. And, most poignantly, she befriends a young boy named Ahmet who sells shells at the local beach. Through these interactions, Yvonne gains new insight into herself and the lives of her children until a tragic accident throws everything into chaos.This is a short but affecting book not only about how we move through grief but also about how we define ourselves through relationships. As much as Yvonne longs to be alone with her memories and her thoughts, she cannot stop herself from connecting with other people and being affected by them. These strangers change the way she thinks about herself and her life in ways that she never imagined. While the accident will not come as a surprise, it is still very moving. Vida While some of the relationships in the book felt a little forced, the friendship between Yvonne and Ahmet was wonderful and the exploration of Yvonne's complex and difficult relationships with her addict daughter was also very well done.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended. This book will not appeal to everyone. It is very introspective and quiet with little action or major entanglements. Still, it manages to be affecting and provides a very interesting character in Yvonne."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/758088-eve", "userReview": "It's been over a month now since I've read this book and I am still thinking about the ending - in fact, about much of the book. It's not very long; I read it in one or two sittings straight on through. Because I am enthralled with Turkey and love reading books set there (a reflection of my longing to revisit), I was immediately drawn to The Lovers by Vendela Vida. The premise of a woman going on vacation to a village by the sea and the title suggest that this story might romanticise travel (and thus might be a good beach/vacation read). Instead, The Lovers is a character driven, psychological study of a woman burdened by memories and guilt, who is trying to navigate the world after her husband's death. Traveling alone to a foreign and bewildering country becomes a metaphor for how one survives loss of a loved one and eventually, how to find one's self. The narrative is tensely drawn and, just like real travel, is tinged with the possibility of danger at every corner. Will she be taken advantage of? What are the hidden motives of those she meets? Here, Turkey is depicted as beautiful, run down in some places, strange, and slightly threatening. This is not a lighthearted book that celebrates travel - rather it makes one uneasy.You know something profound is going to happen to Yvonne, possibly something tragic. Vida builds the psychological suspense so effectively that the unforgettable ending threw me off completely. I am still mulling over it and can't decide exactly what happened. Which doesn't mean it wasn't satisfying, more unexpected."}, {"userName": "Johanneke", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1114237-johanneke", "userReview": "Op de weegschaal, deze. Het ene schaaltje heet 'goed' (niet excellent, helaas) en het andere schaaltje heet 'gekunsteld'.

Vida's last book was a real heartbreaker, and this one is no less gut-wrenching. But her characters are so complex that even as their worlds spiral downwards, there's something you can hold onto and identify with within so much sadness. The main character in the Lovers returns to the scene of her honeymoon years later, after her husband has been \"killed,\" and tries to make her way through a new coastal landscape and all the old conflicts her family has gone through over the years. The memories of the family get into deeper issues of parenthood, like the complicated mix of shame and pride parents can have for their children, moving the story from the present into a thorny past. I loved the book--couldn't put it down for the two days I was reading it. Vida is really skilled at delving into the darkest elements of romantic and familial relationships without burying you in some relentless depression. The hope at the very end of the book is one of the most moving moments of the novel."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4362349-jennifer", "userReview": "This book is so well written.

I finished the book and I still couldn't answer those questions.As I said, the writing is so memorable and enjoyable, but the story was implausible at times and at those portions I lost interest in the main character. My mind began to wander as to whether or not the story was supposed to be believable or whether things had taken a turn for art's sake. I'm all for art, literature, poetry, but I was confused by this book. Certain plot points, like what was the whole thing about the owl? Ozlem is like an angel, but why?

This doesn't have the same punchy style which moves the story on so quickly in the more recent novel, no doubt because it is exploring a theme - how we deal with the aftermath of death - that requires a more measured approach. Indeed the meandering style is successful in creating an air of mystery, but one which is never quite resolved: a hint of sexual tension, a friendship which is never quite fulfilled, a marriage whose loss has had a massive impact on the novel's main haracter, Yvonne, but turns out not to have been completely satisfactory and to have been in the process of unwinding - further developments being cut off by her husband's sudden death.In every way this is a more probable story than the recent novel, and like real life its themes are explored in rather inconclusive ways.
