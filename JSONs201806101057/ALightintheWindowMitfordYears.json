Someone commented that these are the types of books which little old ladies read when they feel like they can put their collective noses into other people's affairs. If one hasn't read these books, that's a pretty good assessment, which is to say that it is totally incorrect. While Jan Karon has a huge following, no doubt composed in part of little old ladies, these stories are anything but what they appear to be on the outside. While the excitement is of a far more subtle sort, it is extremely human... as well as Christian. Without preaching, it successfully delivers the method of the utmost simplicity, something of which I think our Father would approve. It takes a while to become used to reading these, especially when you are expecting something exciting and dangerous, but what you end up with is that people are real and they solve their issues in very real ways. These are funny, inviting and joyful books of the Christian faith, and without too much of a stretch, I would probably say that they were inspired also. They are works of grace and beauty also, but that takes a while to see, if you are a complicated person with a complicated life. It makes you wonder why we made our lives so complex in the first place...and what we missed when we did so."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "Had you asked me I would never have thought I'd be reading a series of books like this one. (Not macho, you know). This is the story of a middle aged (maybe late middle-age?) clergyman in a small town. Again I came over these when i was listening to books and reading whatever I could get my hands on it seemed and I was surprised how involving these were. I hate soap operas and these books (except possibly for the \"Wedding Book\" which i couldn't get through) don't \"slump\" into soap opera mode. I like most of these and that truly surprised me.Timothy and the other characters here will I believe appeal to a wide audience. Life lessons, love with \"work clothes on\", human relationships and plots. Pretty good."}, {"userName": "Jacq Jardin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636793-jacq-jardin", "userReview": "\"I so enjoyed this book.

There's no heavy drama, no shocking twists, no explosive ending. But it's every bit as charming and engrossing as all the other books I gave five stars to. I think it's simply impossible to read it and not fall in love with the characters. They are warm, friendly, happy people, and they love and take care of each other. Edith Mallory is a bit too annoying at times, but she provides all the necessary additional spice to the storyline. And I love Cynthia's candor and independence. I think Father Tim took too much time pondering where the relationship was headed but still, all's well that ends well. And that Dooley Barlowe? I have to say he's a total star.

I am the one who is impatient. I am the one who is unable to find any sort of humor in innocent misunderstandings or mistaken identities. (This also explains why I'm not a fan of French farce.) I have proven to myself this year that I am indeed capable of enjoying stories that don't involve other-worldly creatures or kick-butt crime-solving or alternate realities (those would be the Maisie Dobbs books and The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society), but I find myself unable to commit to you, dear Mitfordians.Again, please forgive me. It is definitely me, not you. There are thousands, probably millions, of readers who will love you and treasure you for all that you are. Because you are a decent, hard-working and pleasant story.

It's a syrupy sweet old fashioned read which does not demand anything of the reader. Many find the series feel good, and there are some sparkles of true conflict here and there, but mostly it's about the mundane daily plight of a vicar who finds love later in life and saves people - emotionally and physically. If you like the first in the series, keep reading because you will be comforted by the characters and will want to see who is added to the \"family.\" This reads like it was made for a TV series, which I am surprised it has not been made into for PBS yet!What I like about this series is that it doesn't try to be anything it is not; that in itself makes it charming, and if you want to read a simple, feel good, clean series, then this is it."}, {"userName": "Janie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1297923-janie", "userReview": "You have to read this whole series..

He has narrated all of the Mitford series books and is a treasure. As many know, quite often the scenes center on his fictional church or the choir. A veteran of the Glimmerglass Opera Company, he sings the hymns himself which is an extra treat for listeners. When one voice actor has read all of the titles in a series, that performer has created a strong connection to listeners. Thus, just as listening to another story of Mitford is enhanced by its familiarity so hearing John McDonough's narration stirs feelings of comfort and recognition. McDonough describes his first reading of a book as being ' like the first listening of a piece of music.' 'You have to be completely free,' he said. . 'As you read and think about the piece, you hear voices, and it starts to take on life.' How fortunate for all of us! In this, the second installment of the popular series, Father Tim has just returned from a vacation - his first in over a dozen years. While he enjoyed the respite he is a bit anxious to come home and see his neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith, a woman with whom he thought he had an understanding. He's perplexed by what he perceives as her coolness and a bit agitated when a widow in his congregation sets her sights on him. The church has undertaken the building of a care center and an unexpected visitor arrives, evidently for an extended stay. Life goes on in Mitford as listeners renew acquaintances with some of the townspeople and once again are charmed by the fictional community."}, {"userName": "Athornton", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3027714-athornton", "userReview": "Another charming read. It was good to reconnect with the characters in this quaint town. It's a good holiday read because it is not overwhelming, sad or depressing. I would love to visit a town like this if it in fact exists, with knowing each and every person's history, supporting each other and the town parties and festivities that everyone has to play a role in. I like how the characters' stories continue to wind together and new relations are discovered plus the inclusion of one of two outsiders to keep the story going. I was also happier reading this story since it focused on only a few of the characters and did not have as much character introductions, as the first book did. Made it much easier to follow the book.

Have looked forward to reading this since finishing At Home in Mitford. Do you find yourself smiling when you read this series? I do. Now that's a good read :-) This second in the Mitford series by Jan Karon did not disappoint. Ready to jump into book three! There's really nothing to say about the book, other than I highly recommend that you read it, if you haven't already. Even if you have, as a number of people have told me, it's time to read them again.Small town life, real life problems and personalities, real faith in a personal God, real colorful characters, old, young, in-between, sane and not-so-sane, a marvelous dog named Barnabus, and a published cat named Violet, not-so-marvelous. Plenty of action, plenty of conversation, plenty of aha moments. I especially enjoyed the description and history of Miss Sadie's ballroom ceiling.This book is packed with good stuff about Father Tim and the ways he cares for people. His opinion of himself is in great contrast to what he does. That is a good part of what makes this a great book. That woven together with many other threads.I did wonder about the mention of Percy and Velma's youngest grandchild waving a fly swatter over the orange marmalade cake (p.368), since they had a new grand baby a month or so previous :-)What are your favorite moments in Mitford?"}, {"userName": "Dianna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4752531-dianna", "userReview": "In the second book of the Father Tim series, Father Tim is returning from a summer in Sligo.

He's got his 12-year-old foster child, Dooley, to look after, a church building project, parishioners to counsel, and of course, the weekly sermon to write. Karon's style reminds me of L.M.
