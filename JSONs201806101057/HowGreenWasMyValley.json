It's something so beautiful that my heart aches to dwell on it. It aches because I long to be apart of something so perfect and wish for such beauty in everything I experience. I feel I belong in that small Welsh mining town, that I should be spending all of my time supporting my family and town, singing with friends, learning voraciously, worshiping God intelligently and recognizing Him in every aspect of life, fiercely defending my friends, loving foolishly and uncontrollably, revering nature and losing myself in valleys, groves, creeks, and hill sides, or fighting and fighting and fighting with passionate words and quick fists for people, places and ideas that need me.----------------------------So it's 2 years later and I haven't updated this review yet. A friend of mine asked why. I guess it's because talking about things - giving them words - sometimes destroys this weird illusion that they are more than just the words you give them. I can't use the same medium as the book - words - to praise it in any way that is better than what the book does with that same medium."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "4.5/5 stars. This is a wonderful and very clever piece of fiction about how we tend to remember things from our past fondly while forgetting about how bad things really were. \"How Green Was My Valley\" is a book about nostalgia and it is told from the point of view of Huw, who is now an elder, but who reflects back on his life and his childhood in the valleys of Wales. This novel was wonderfully written with beautiful passages on life as well as note-worthy anecdotes on Huw's childhood and amazing family. A few passages became a bit too dense in their descriptions, but most of them were wonderful. I think this book speaks to a lot of us because it talks about a universal subject, and I'm sure that's why it has become a classic and has survived through time. \"How Green Was My Valley\" comes with its brutalities where things that were not so \"green\" shine through the surface, but most of all it comes with a view on life which I think most of us share: a view of nostalgia and fondness."}, {"userName": "Magrat Ajostiernos", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7018524-magrat-ajostiernos", "userReview": "RESE\u00d1A COMPLETA: https://cronicasdemagrat.wordpress.co...Me ha gustado much\u00edsimo, especialmente la primera mitad del libro, porque los relatos de infancia me fascinan.... y m\u00e1s si est\u00e1n descritos con esa nostalgia y en un ambiente tan peculiar como un pueblo minero en la Gales del final de la \u00e9poca victoriana.Me ha sorprendido la crudeza pero a la vez la ternura que desprende esta historia, y me quedo con sus personajes, con todos pero especialmente con nuestro protagonista... en pocas ocasiones he conseguido coger tanto cari\u00f1o a un personaje protagonista de un libro \u2665"}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009267-meg", "userReview": "I've only re-read a handful of books in my life, and I've read this one at least 5 times. If I had to pick a favorite book of all time (sacrilege!) - it would be this one. Never have I seen prose that has this much POETRY in it. How Green is a unique, lyrical beauty. The coming-of-age narrator, Huw, so well paints a picture of his everyday struggles in a rapidly-industrialized Wales that you can literally hear the birds and smell the blackberry pie. Of course many authors are good at descriptions such as those - but where I believe Llewellyn truly distinguishes himself is in his descriptions of emotional states and experiences. He'll describe a self-righteous man looking up with eyes \"hurting in goodness\" or innumerate the beatings of his heart and lyrics tumbling away to Forgot as he stands in church to sing a solo... and I just want to scream inside because I've felt EXACTLY that way before and never been able to process it into such perfect words. The moral messages are amazing. The characters are unforgettable. Somehow I understand life better when I read this book.MY FAVORITE SECTION OF ANY BOOK EVER WRITTEN:\"I am Beth Morgan,\" my mother said, and her voice was as deep and strong as any man. \"I have come up here to tell you what I do think of you all, because I have heard you are talking against my husband. Two things in this world I do hate. One is talking behind the back, and the other is lice. So you should know what I do think of you... You are a lot of cowards to talk against my husband... How some of you can sit in the same Chapel with him I cannot tell. I would look for a flame of fire upon me, indeed. But there is one thing more I will say and that is this. If harm do come to my Gwilym, I will find out the men and I will kill them with my hands. And that I will swear by God Almighty. And there will be no Hell for me. Nobody will go to Hell for killing lice.\"FAVORITE QUOTES:I never met anybody whose talk was better than good food. It is strange how loud little sounds become when you are in the dark and doing something wrong.\"Trouble will not stop in a man whose lungs are filled with fresh air.\" (Papa Gwilym)After that, it was like trying to talk through a net. Words seemed to stick in the air. Nobody seemed willing to look at anybody else. And when somebody laughed, you could tell how hard they were trying.\"Man was made in the image of God. Is God a sheep? Because if He is, I understand why we are all so damned stupid.\" (Ianto)I saw her face as she bent to blow out the candle with her mouth in the shape of a kiss, still the smile in the eyes, but now as a mother will look at her child that cries in the arms of another woman, softer, and with more of want.He cleared his throat as though pain had been his only meal for hours.\"You cannot blame ignorant men. You might as well kick a dog for not wishing good morning.\" (Mr. Gruffydd)\"I thought when I was a young man that I would conquer the world with truth. I thought I would lead an army greater than Alexander ever dreamed of, not to conquer nations, but to liberate mankind. With truth. With the golden sound of the Word. But only a few heard the trumpet. Only a few understood. The rest of them put on black and sat in Chapel.\" (Mr. Gruffydd)\"It is only when men forget to fight for right that they fail. There are plenty to fight for wrong.\" (Ianto)They could not have had more happiness in their eyes, and my heart could not have known more lightness, or I would have been off the earth and drinking the skies."}, {"userName": "Peggy Scripter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2527099-peggy-scripter", "userReview": "Richard Llewellen's writing is akin to Welsh singing, so beautiful it takes your breath away. In the beginning it seems like it will bog down in talk of forming a union, but read on. Although important to carry the story, it never does get tedious with that! This story is written so beautifully it has a lilt and cadence that will lift you up. Examples:  Page 88, \"O, blackberry tart, with berries as big as your thumb, purple and black, and thick with juice, and a crust to endear them that will go to cream in your mouth, and both passing down with such a taste that will make you close your eyes and wish you might live for ever in the wideness of that rich moment.\" Page 159, \"There is beautiful to watch a mountain sleeping, and other mountains in the other valleys rising up like bits of blue velvet to make you feel you could cut a piece and wear it for a coat, to dance in above the fat clouds.\" Page 165, \"Sing then. Sing, indeed, with shoulders back, and head up so that song might go to the roof and beyond to the sky. Mass on mass of tone, with a hard edge, and rich with quality, every single note a carpet of colour woven from basso profundo, and basso, and baritone, and alto, and tenor, and soprano, and alto and mezzo, and contralto, singing and singing, until life and all things living are become a song. O, Voice of Man, organ of most lovely might.\" Makes me long to hear the rich Welsh tones of yesteryear. Page 231, \"The more he whistled, the more the trees tried to hush him, and the bigger the tree, the bigger the hush, and beating at him with their arms to stop him tickling them, but no use, for he was in one side and out the other, and nothing they could do only wave at him, and hush more.\" And on page 234, after the poetry of the words fills your soul, you can whip up some brandy broth to fill your belly: \"O Brandy Broth is the King of Broth and royal in the rooms of the mouth. A good chicken and a noble piece of ham, with a little shoulder of lamb, small to have the least of grease, and then a paste of the roes of trout with cream, a bit of butter, and the yolk of egg, whipped tight and poured in when the chicken, proud with a stuffing of sage and thyme, has been elbowing the lamb and the ham in the earthenware pot until all three are tender as the heart of a mother. In with the carrots and turnips and the goodness of marrow bones, and in with a mixing of milk and potatoes. Now watch the clock and every fifteen minutes pour in a noggin of brandy, and with the first a pint of home-brewed ale. Two noggins in, and with the third, throw in the chopped bottoms of leeks, but save the green leaves until ten minutes from the time you sit to eat, for then you shall find them still a lovely green.\" Page 249, \"If there shall come a time when you leave this house without a proper something to eat,\" said my mother, \"look for me on the floor.\"Please read this book!"}, {"userName": "Hana", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10571559-hana", "userReview": "[Why would a mother, knowing her village's Puritanical, gossip-addiction, actually encourage her teenage son to move in with the family's young, comely widow?

I started out reading it silently to myself, but after a chapter or so I had to start reading it aloud to my husband. The writing was so gorgeous, so tender and deeply felt, that I couldn't not share it. Even now, almost seventeen years later, I can remember entire passages word for word. I'm pretty sure I could tell you each episode of the book, in order. There's no plot here, it's a series of episodes or vignettes in the life of young Huw, growing up in a mining town in Wales. His family, his friends, are all here, painted with loving clarity. Such a beautiful book . . . now that I'm writing this I think I need to get my own copy and reread it.

It's one of the most popular of the Welsh books I've read -- the one whose popularity has been most enduring, anyway -- and it's hard to understand why, when comparing the cloyingly nostalgic and sentimental story here to the vivacious and real work of Jack Jones and even Caradoc Evans. I guess that's it, though: it's nostalgic and sentimental and it lets the reader feel all weepy about industrialised Wales, without anger or overt political leanings. B.L. Coombes and Lewis Jones weren't mourning for a hopelessly lost past, but arguing in their moment for change, for fairness, for their lives.Richard Llewellyn was writing after the fact, I read, based on other people's memories. He didn't live it, so he could afford to look on it with purple-prose tinted glasses. And I wonder how much he came in contact with Welsh Nonconformism, because the chapel was a part of his story but it definitely didn't have the same effect I see even in more modern Welsh work like Emyr Humphreys'.So, maybe I would have enjoyed How Green Was My Valley more if I hadn't read it at the same time as I was reading the hard, unshowy works by working class writers who were also miners. It definitely suffered in comparison with the passion of those, and spoke much more to nostalgia. It does capture something of Wales, I think -- parts of it made me feel hiraeth so fiercely -- and parts of the story are compelling, but I don't want to pine after a long-gone Wales. The work of the miner-writers might no longer be relevant, but Wales was very alive to them, and I'd rather spend time with that."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/747570-elizabeth", "userReview": "I'm having a hard time figuring out how to rate this book.On the one hand I recognize that it is beautifully written. Possibly the most beautifully written prose I've ever read. But beautiful prose isn't really that exciting to me. It kept putting me to sleep and it was taking FOREVER to get through the book. Finally after almost a month when I was at around page 300 I decided to start skipping \"the irrelevant stuff.\" My husband asked how I knew I wasn't missing anything important. I told him I'd already read more than 300 pages so I had a pretty good feel for what I need to read in order to follow the plot.I felt like I had been very patiently waiting for the author to set the stage and give me all of the background and let me get to know the characters. But I was out of patience and I was ready to find out what this book was really about. I wanted to know \"what happens.\"But nothing ever does. Not really. I mean all of the little story lines were interesting. I liked all of the characters and I genuinely cared about what happened to them. But I really missed the big picture. It just wasn't enough for me.And so I can't rate the book very high, because that would be like recommending it, which I don't really. But I can't rate it low because that would be like saying it's not a good book which it obviously is.

It did take a while to get into and was quite slow and boring towards the end, but other than that it was a great read. -How Green Was My Valley seemed like less of a story and more like a pleasant stroll through the early years of someone's life. More specifically Huw Morgan's life, with him reminiscing about his childhood and the valley that was his home. There was no real solid plot, just Huw looking back at his family, and the many changes/ups and downs he (and his family) had to face. It was delightful to just read about Huw growing up and his everyday life in the valley and the simplicity and struggle of it all. -I adored the old fashioned, picturesque setting. The valley and mining community was portrayed so vividly and beautifully, it was easy to see why Huw loved his valley/home. -I enjoyed Huw's character for the most part, he was much more endearing when he was younger though. I didn't find him as interesting when he was older, he seemed to lose all his charm and depth and just wasn't all that likeable. Thankfully, most of the book was about his childhood rather than his adulthood.-I found Huw's parents quite irritating, Gwilym was so self righteous and Beth was so backwards, I guess that was realistic though for the time. Gwil and Beth's relationship was beautiful though, the love they had for each other was so pure and sweet. Even though they were great together as a couple, they were rubbish parents, I hated how they ruined Angharad's life by pushing her to marry Iestyn instead of Gruffydd. They should have known better than anyone that love would have made Angharard far, far more happier than marrying someone rich. I also hated Gruffydd for not fighting for Angharad, if he had trusted her and had faith in her (and himself) he could have saved them both from a soulless existence, instead they both ended up depressed and lonely. -I didn't enjoy all the melodramatic metaphorical nonsense that Huw monologued about when it came to romantic love, sex, and singing/choir stuff. It was so over the top, flowery and ridiculous. Thankfully, Huw for the most part spent his time banging on about other more interesting coming-of-age stuff. -The Marged story arc was beyond ridiculous, I didn't buy her going crazy and setting herself on fire just because of Owen. Her whole relationship with Owen occurred over the course of a few days, they didn't have a long romance or a deep connection of any kind. Their relationship consisted entirely of a few kisses and half-hearted promises over the course of a week. But for some bizarre reason Marged never recovered from his rejection, even when she got married to Gwilym (who she knew better and had far more of a bond with). Yea, Owen was barely in her life long enough for him to have such an effect on her. The whole thing was daft, if their courtship had been longer or they'd been childhood sweethearts or something then her Owen-related madness/death might have been plausible but that wasn't the case. Ugh, I hated what happened to Marged, so bloody nonsensical.-Even though it was all fictional, the insight into the mining world, and the struggle and fight for fair wages was fascinating (as well as infuriating). It was no doubt a true enough refection on how badly miners and other such workers were treated in those days, it really made me glad not to live in such crappy, hopeless times. -Loved the Welsh brogue, it added to the atmosphere and really gave the tight knit community a genuine feel. -I was disappointed with where the story ended, I would have liked to know more about Huw's family and the valley. What happened to Ceinwen? Did she get to go to London and act? Did Bronwen remarry? Did Angharad and Gruffydd ever find some kind of peace and happiness in Patagonia/Cape Town? How did Beth cope without Gwil? Did the Morgan family ever reunite or keep in contact with each other or did they stay apart their whole lives? I really wanted to continue on with their stories and find out what happened to them. -Apparently, there's three more books about Huw's life but they sound like utter rubbish, and seem to revolve solely around Huw being rich and horny. Yea, I'd rather read about Huw's family than grown-up-immoral-unfaithful-Huw-who-cares-nothing-for-his-childhood-or-the-lessons-he-learnt. I'll have to make do with just this book."}, {"userName": "booklady", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady", "userReview": "The title, How Green Was My Valley is a giveaway. We know the beautiful green valley is going to change and probably not for the better. This isn't going to be a happy story\u2014or anyway, not one with a happy ending. Or so were my thoughts going into this book. Somehow I missed the 1941 movie* of the same name\u2014and it had Maureen O'Hara no less, one of my all-time favorite actresses. Although Richard Llewellyn's book was first published in 1939 and sounded really familiar I don't remember ever reading it before now. Unusual for me, I waited to read anything about HGWMV until after I finished it. My only 'background', if you can call it that, were the several times back in the early 1980's when I visited Wales. It is truly beautiful!So everything is there for the perfect book: haunting coming-of-age-story; immensely likable main character, Huw; large, varied and loving family; idyllic setting\u2014the 'green valley' of a Welch mining town; romance, drama and humor, even if it's all set to change. It's hard to say much about the book without giving the story away which I don't appreciate so I won't. But I keep seeing the green valleys of Wales in my mind now in a new way. When I drove there as a young US Air Force Lieutenant on a holiday they were beautiful scenery, lovely to look at and photograph. Now I see and remember them as homes, workplaces and graves of real people. An unforgettable story. *I'm going to have fix that!Jun 28, 2016: This is my book-candy when Apologia Pro Vita Sua gets my head too fogged up!

Some one once said, after seeing the beauty of Alaska, that he wished he had seen it as an old man, for it's magnificent beauty would surely spoil any scene he would ever see after. That's how I feel about this lovely, beautiful, wonderful book. I am afraid nothing I read will ever make me feel like this. I feel quite touched by it.  It's about a small coal-mining village in Wales and the people in it. The focus is on a big wonderful family that loves each other very much though they sure do have their share of trouble. The point of view is that of Huw, beginning when he is just 6 years old and going all the way to his middle age. The prose is, well, poetry. I collected my favorite bits in a list on the bag page but there are too many to fit here. Here's but a few: \"Beautiful were the days that are gone, and O, for them to be back. The mountain was green, and proud with a good covering of oak and ash, and washing his feet in a streaming river clear as the eyes of God. The winds came down with the scents of the grass and wild flowers, putting a sweetness to our noses, and taking away so that nobody could tell what beauty had been stolen, only that the winds were old robbers who took something from each grass and flower and gave it back again, and gave a little to each of us, and took it away again.\"\"...a tidy house, but open to the weather, and the winds had choir practice whenever they could on every side of it.\"\"Ceinwen was in my mind, and I kept her there as men keep libraries of rare books, seldom to be touched but happy to know you have got.\" I wonder if anyone could ever write such a masterpiece again.

I found this book to be very atmospheric with beautiful passages of quote-worthy prose and really enjoyed the Welsh dialect. BUT, it just felt so incredibly slow for most of the book, and I found the self righteousness of the characters (and of the time) to grow stale and repetitive. It seemed odd that the book began with the main character leaving the valley, yet as the story of his childhood and coming of age unfolds, you never get to the point where he came to the decision to leave the valley. Unfortunately, I never felt fully invested in the characters or engaged in the story which made it difficult to pick back up when there are so many other books whispering my name.... A mixed bag, but overall an enjoyable read simply due to the author's poetic way with words and depiction of Wales. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: The man is made of stone who will see a woman in her tears and keep voice and hands to himself.First Sentence: I am going to pack my two shirts with my other socks and my best suit in the little blue cloth my mother used to tie round her hair when she did the house, and I am going from the Valley."}, {"userName": "Myriam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3793355-myriam", "userReview": "What can I say?

The characters were so real. I felt like I was right there in the town, in the small home, smelling the same things, eating with them, doing dishes. How did Llewellyn accomplish that? This was the second time I read this (the first being when I was a young teenager.) I'll be reading it again throughout my life, I'm sure. I'm convinced a teenager's brain is made of fluff, for I remember very little from that first reading. It was as if I hadn't read it before, almost. This second time, I was deeply affected. So much of the struggles with the mine and their wages really hit home. Times aren't really so different now and it was good to read my husband's thoughts and feelings on the pages of a book published 70 years ago, so beautifully and accurately written by Llewellyn. Good and bad, I guess. I was glad to have insight into man's heart, but saddened that the fight in life is so much the same still. I'm under the false impression that with time, the quality of humankind's life in general improves. Books like this teach me that it isn't necesarrily so in some aspects. Maybe that is what made the book so touching to me: it hit on the joys and travails of life that are universal. I wept at the end. My two-year-old found me like that and went and told my husband, \"Dad, Mom sad.\" He came and found me and I was still in a state, but all I had to say was, \"I finished the book,\" and he smiled and I smiled and he understood and left me to wrap up the experience in solitude. What a book."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50378-angie", "userReview": "I'll just go ahead and start by saying this review is a hard one for me to write. My emotions become tied up in all of the books I have loved over the years, and it matters very little what genre they are or what the writing style is or when they were written and by whom. Those books that I really love, I tend to love with wild abandon and, once given, that devotion is rarely retracted. My friend Janicu recently commented that I am \"the queen of re-reading.\" And this is true. I love nothing better than a cozy sit down with an old friend, and I don't hesitate to put off the shiny new tome I've got in my hand if the battered old one is the one that's calling my name. But there is one book that I can't let myself reread too often. In fact, I've only read it twice in my life. I joke (but, of course, I'm not really joking at all) that I can only read it once every decade, because the contents are too beautiful and too painful for everyday wear. That book is HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY by Richard Llewellyn. It sat in my house the entire time I was growing up, and I vaguely knew that it was a favorite of my mother's because of her Welsh ancestry. It was the title that drew me to it. What a wonderful title. I would go over and stroke the spine, but I never pulled it out. I think because I was worried it might not live up to its beautiful title. Finally, one summer I got the courage up to give it a shot. I've never been the same. I am going to pack my two shirts with my other socks and my best suit in the little blue cloth my mother used to tie round her hair when she did the house, and I am going from the Valley. Those are the the first words the reader encounters in this impressive volume. And they're the ones that made me certain this book and I would have a relationship. Growing up in a small coal mining town in South Wales, the youngest of a raft of five brothers and three sisters, Huw Morgan believed life would always be the same. From helping his mother cook her bottomless, delicious meals in the family kitchen, to taking his weekly penny down to the taffy pullers for a length of homemade taffy, to watching his larger-than-life father and stout older brothers make the daily trek down the hill and home from the mines, Huw's life is filled to the brim with the sights and sounds and people of home. In love with his oldest brother's wife from a very young age, and well aware of his lowly status within the family hierarchy, Huw knows what is his and what is not. But his is a heart that knows how to love and he watches closely over the members of his family as they encounter the myriad trials and heartaches of life and as he himself is put through the painful process of growing up and becoming a man. Along the way, almost everything about his humble life is altered, through strikes, schooling, marriage, betrayal, passion, death, and even boxing. Through it all, Huw struggles to reconcile the life that he knew with the life that is and to remember the good and the beautiful along with the bad and the ugly. Written in 1939, HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY is a tribute to the Welsh people and culture. Prior to reading this book, I don't think I'd ever felt as immersed in a version of our own world as I did in this one. Many a fantasy novel captured my imagination, but a work of historical fiction set only a few decades in the past? That was a first. Llewellyn's storytelling is second to none. To this day I'm in awe of the compassion and loving attention to detail that went into the telling. A very favorite passage (from so many it's impossible to count): Bronwen came over plenty of Saturdays after that, but I was always shy of her. I think I must have fallen in love with Bronwen even then and I must have been in love with her all my life since. It is silly to think a child could fall in love. If you think about it like that, mind. But I am the child that was, and nobody knows how I feel, except only me. And I think I fell in love with Bronwen that Saturday on the hill.I fell in love with Bronwen (and Huw) that day on the hill as well. And I have been in love with them both ever since. That simple, measured, and certain way Huw has of narrating his story sort of swallowed me from page one. Told in alternating passages between the present and the past, the man and the boy, the narrative incorporates the reader in such a way that it becomes almost immediately painful to contemplate your inevitable extraction from it all at the end. This is one of those ones where you dread the turning of the final pages. And, if you're me, you're having trouble seeing them because the tears are welling up so quickly and so close together. Yes, an overwhelming sense of nostalgia and loss pervades all 600+ pages, but somehow it stops well short of being trite or cloying. So much of it is the beautiful, beautiful language. I would love this book for the language alone, if for nothing and no one else. It is unmatched. It haunts me, tripping after me out of nowhere sometimes. The sing-song sentences, the inverted wording, and the lovely names come back to me over and over again, and I'm once again in the Valley with Huw and Bronwen, Ianto and Angharad, Gwilym and Dai Bando. I read this aloud with my husband (then-boyfriend) and I really can't overstate how beautiful it is read aloud. And shared with someone else who appreciates the endless nuance and the inviting whisper of a language used to its fullest capacity, wrapped in and around characters who wring you out and own a piece of your soul by the time it is through. Truly the most lyrical and beautiful book I have ever read, I'll be all set to pick it up again in another ten years or so."}, {"userName": "TheSkepticalReader", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-theskepticalreader", "userReview": "Took 3 tries and quite a lot of pages but I ended up really liking it."}, {"userName": "M.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22191185-m", "userReview": "\u00c7ocukken okudu\u011fum klasik romanlar vard\u0131.

For me, this book's beauty read sharply, showing strength in simple naturalistic description and dialogue. Its characters, who I found deeply relatable, are rare enough, in literature and in life. I already miss the hearth with its ever-present tea, and cry again for the valley.Some reviewers have addressed the author's fraud, but I did not consider it while reading.

It was wise and poignant and marinated in song:\"Singing was in my father as sight is in the eye.\"\"Sing, then. Sing, indeed, with shoulders back, and head up so that song might go to the roof and beyond to the sky. Mass on mass of tone, with a hard edge, and rich with quality, every single note a carpet of colour woven from basso profundo, and basso, and baritone, and alto, and tenor, and soprano, and alto and mezzo, and contralto, singing and singing, until life and all things living are become a song.\" Memories of a Welsh coal miner's family home are deftly painted on the mind's eye, simple but rich scenes: \" Indeed, if happiness has a smell, I know it well, for our kitchen has always had it faintly, but in those days it was all over the house.\"\"Dear little house that I have lived in, there is happiness you have seen, even before I was born. In you is my life, and all the people I have loved are a part of you, so to go out of you, and leave you, is to leave myself.\"Life in the green valley was destined to be marred by lack of stewardship. The ugly slag of the coal mine eventually swallowed up the beauty, and the idyllic life is likewise swallowed up by divisions and rifts created by labor disputes. The beautiful sense of family and community is shattered, but the reader savors every single crystalline memory along with the narrator. One of the themes was justice, and the folks in the coal mining community derived their sense of justice from the Bible. They were absolutely unified around their principles. I was surprised by their swiftness in carrying out justice and their pride in making it a local affair rather than one to entrust to English authorities. I was equally surprised by their literary acuity, the high caliber of their musicality, and their poetry. These were not backward simpletons, but people who had huge caches of beautiful words and songs and recipes that were not saved only for special occasions. They lived and breathed daily beauty in the midst of the black coal waste that eventually snuffed it out.\"And nothing more I hate than a table laid without care. Stains on a cloth, or wrinkles, or a knife not in the straight, a fork turned aside, a spoon put the wrong way up, will have my thoughts in a knot until they are put right.\" Here are lovely memories laid out as a feast---sad ones, too--- that create an enduring and satisfying picture of domestic contentment.

In spite of labor disputes, food shortages and a near-death experience for the hero, Huw Morgan, the upbeat tone carried through in what to me was a soothing manner. How Green Was My Valley offers the reader to step into pre-industrialized Wales and watch the traditions, customs slip away as times change. Slip away as do the younger generation lured by London, America and a chance to make a name for themselves through pursuit of military careers. The story follows Huw Morgan through the course of his life focusing on his coming-of-age years and how his beliefs were formed and the lessons he learns along the way.Huw's beliefs are influenced heavily by his parents, brothers and village preacher. The preacher doesn't fit the traditional mold often opting for mercy over church rules.The language and color of this book is beautiful to behold. As I listened to the audio version I felt like I had walked into the story. Many of my friends mentioned they had read this book in high school.

Internet searches turn up many references to the Oscar winning 1941 film, but very few about the book itself. I loved the language and it made the book for me. The characters (and their environs) are fictional--a bildungsroman that held my attention, made me laugh, and even brought a few tears.

It really is poetry. This is a book that makes you realize what life should be about. I truly agreed with the review by Wesley and hope he will forgive me for quoting him because it sums up the feelings I had about this book even though I was not so able to voice them -\"I feel I belong in that small Welsh mining town, that I should be spending all of my time supporting my family and town, singing with friends, learning voraciously, worshiping God intelligently and recognizing Him in every aspect of life, fiercely defending my friends, loving foolishly and uncontrollably, revering nature and losing myself in valleys, groves, creeks, and hill sides, or fighting and fighting and fighting with passionate words and quick fists for people, places and ideas that need me.\"One of my favorite passages comes when Huw is walking back over the mountain from taking Bronwen and Olwen to town. The imagery is glorious.\"The sky became a sudden gold, and the mountain was of silver, and the river ran free and wide as a sea in a brilliance of precious stones. All about the mountain-top was a sparkling of unsheathed steel, and I saw, with a loftiness of fear, that a host of men were standing there looking into the Valley, and armour was shining on head and breast, and colours were gay on shields, and hands were clasped on the hilts of swords that pointed into the ground...The Men of the Valley were marching again. My fathers were singing up there. Loud, triumphant, the anthem rose, and I knew, in some deep place within, that in the royal music was a prayer to lift up my spirit, to be of good cheer, to keep the faith, that Death is only an end to the things that are made of clay, and to fight, without heed of wounds, all that brings death to the spirit, with Glory to the Eternal Father, for ever, Amen.\" pages 422-423"}, {"userName": "Elsa K", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k", "userReview": "This is one of those books I imagine myself reading over and over.

I also was saddened by a lot of the main characters seeming to 'give up' in the end.

Yes Llewellyn combines events and feelings of a wider era than that covered by Morgan's story but in doing so he brings to life every aspect of the Valleys, from their mining history, their battles for better conditions, pay and benefits, their struggle to make ends meet and most importantly their sense of family and community and of course their pride in being Welsh. A superb book that I am bound to read again and again."}], "description": "A poignant coming-of-age novel set in a Welsh mining town, Richard Llewellyn's How Green Was My Valley is a paean to a more innocent age, published in Penguin Modern ClassicsGrowing up in a mining community in rural South Wales, Huw Morgan is taught many harsh lessons - at the kitchen table, at Chapel and around the pit-head. Looking back on the hardships of his early life, where difficult days are faced with courage but the valleys swell with the sound of Welsh voices, it becomes clear that there is nowhere so green as the landscape of his own memory. An immediate bestseller on publication in 1939, How Green Was My Valley quickly became one of the best-loved novels of the twentieth century. Poetic and nostalgic, it is an elegy to a lost world.Richard Dafydd Vivian Llewellyn Lloyd (1906-1983), better known by his pen name Richard Llewellyn, claimed to have been born in St David's, Pembrokeshire, Wales; after his death he was discovered to have been born of Welsh parents in Hendon, Middlesex. His famous first novel How Green Was My Valley (1939) was begun in St David's from a draft he had written in India, and was later adapted into an Oscar-winning film by director John Ford. None But the Lonely Heart, his second novel, was published in 1943, and subsequently made into a film starring Cary Grant and Ethel Barrymore. As well as novels including Green, Green My Valley Now (1975) and I Stand on a Quiet Shore (1982), Llewellyn wrote two highly successful plays, Poison Pen and NooseIf you enjoyed How Green Was My Valley, you might like Barry Hines' A Kestrel for a Knave, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.'Vivid, eloquent, poetical, glowing with an inner flame of emotion'The Times Literary Supplement", "title": "How Green Was My Valley", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40496.How_Green_Was_My_Valley", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440708862l/40496.jpg", "reviews": 1160, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22698.Richard_Llewellyn", "name": "Richard Llewellyn"}], "type": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40496.How_Green_Was_My_Valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18131578-qu-verde-era-mi-valle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31332592-how-green-was-my-valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2287906.How_Green_Was_My_Valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18743447-how-green-was-my-valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1226164.How_Green_Was_My_Valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19416405-how-green-was-my-valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30251981-vadim-o-kadar-ye-ildi-ki", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1130694.How_Green_Was_My_Valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6780006-how-green-was-my-valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/270999.Up_Into_The_Singing_Mountain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632078.Green_Green_My_Valley_Now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2440391.Down_Where_The_Moon_Is_Small", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632077.None_But_The_Lonely_Heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1774006.White_Horse_to_Banbury_Cross", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
