A young boy is kidnapped and abused for years, by his abductor. This novel involves the after of that and how hard it is for a family to reunited and adjust after going through such an ordeal. Usually I shy away from books that involve this type of child abuse, but the plot seemed interesting to me.I didn't really feel like I was invested in the story. I don't know if it was the style of writing, which I made it seem like I was hearing this story at a distance, or what the problem was. Overall, I was bored throughout the entire novel. I wasn't satisfied with the ending of the novel. It just seemed to drop off and not really complete the story.The only character I enjoyed was the youngest child, Lark. She was smart and caring. Lark didn't have an opportunity for a normal childhood once Caleb disappeared. Her parents were obviously involved into putting every effort to find Caleb, and seemed to isolate her from society to protect her. When Caleb does return all she wants is to help her brother adjust to returning to his life and family. When he was silent, but the social situation required him to do something she was his cue to speak up or react. Without her he would have been lost.I found the mother, Marlene, to be selfish and immature. I don't know if moving her family to a new country right after Caleb was returned was the best idea. Yes, it may have protected him from the media frenzy, but I would think he should have been in some intensive therapy to deal with what he went through while he was kidnapped and abused. I don't think therapy via phone with his therapist was helping him. Marlene seemed like she was missing her youth and wanted to relive it or at least be buddies with her kids instead of a grown-up. She was struggling with returning to a normal life after Caleb was returned. The past three years she had a goal. Find Caleb. Now that he is back she struggles with finding purpose with her life and that could have been why she was just trying to be friends with Caleb instead of his mother.The book doesn't go into detail with what happened to Caleb while he was gone. You only see pieces of his time with Jolly. After Caleb is returned he is still operating on a survivor's instinct and just tells everyone what they want to hear and not what he is really feeling, which was frustrating as the novel went on. I just really wanted him to get the help he needed and be able to communicate his feelings to his family.I do wish that you got a better sense of what Costa Rica was like, which I didn't with this book."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "Where You Can Find Me follows the Vincent families struggles after the return of their son. He was kidnapped by pedophiles at the age of 11 and returned to them at the 14. Trying to find a place away from the media circus, the mother decides to move the family to her mother-in-laws retreat in Costa Rica. Though life in Costa Rica is not as the escape assume and they definitely cannot escape the emotional troubles they left behind.This book deals with difficult, disturbing and explicited issues. The story is complex throughout and is not an easy read. Absolutely riveting, hoping for a happy ending I read through this story... I know the topic will stick with me for days. Where You Can Find Me is an intense insight into the darker side of humanity and the devastating effects it had on innocence and everyone around them.Honestly, this is not a book I would of chosen to read for pleasure. I am not ignorant to the horrors of life but find my reading time to escape from such topics. That being said, this story was well written, comprehensive in covering a multiple character plot and even though it ended rather abruptly, I was trapped by the story.

Caleb has recently returned from what Lark thinks of as the Gone, abducted three years ago by a pedophile ring and then, against all possible odds, having been reunited with his family. Now, although he is only a short distance ahead of her, the mists hang so heavy between them, that sometimes he is a milky ghost and sometimes he disappears from view altogether.This is a beautiful book. In some ways it reminds me of certain Joyce Carol Oates stories that study the effects of violent crime on family dynamics. In this case, Caleb\u2019s return almost immediately sunders his family, and his mother Marlene spends most of the novel trying to bridge the emotional divide separating her from the son she no longer knows. Caleb, indeed, barely knows himself; he still thinks of himself as \u201cNicky,\u201d the alter ego given him by the man who rescued him from his first abductors and became his \u201cfather\u201d rather than returning him to his family.Other reviews refer to this book as a \u201cthriller,\u201d which seems an odd misnomer to me, although it does have some of the pleasing tropes of traditional crime fiction, including a bit of good old-fashioned code cracking \u2013 but it\u2019s bound to discomfort readers who expect a more facile treatment of difficult subject matter. In particular is the loyalty and even love Caleb still feels for Jolly \u2013 what a shudder that clown-like name provokes! \u2013 the man he still views as, and who in many ways was, his savior. Joseph\u2019s nuanced writing will not let us dismiss this as Helsinki Syndrome and thereby put it away in a convenient box and forget about it, but forces us to confront our understanding of love, for as much as we don\u2019t want to admit it, we have to consider the disturbing idea that Jolly also loves Caleb.This is why I think the designation thriller is mistaken. A thriller offers a vicarious experience of an extreme situation that, thankfully, most of us will never face, whereas Joseph retrieves her characters from the Gone in order to have them face what is true for all of us anyway, but which is too disturbing to dwell on except in flashes of insight or while under the spell of a masterful author: that just because a person is familiar does not make him any less oa mystery, just that the mystery itself becomes familiar; that we do not know even ourselves; and that our world is bounded by ghosts and shadows.We all live in the Cloud Forest."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "3.5 I started reading this right before they found those women in Cleveland and that kind of freaked me out because in this book Caleb is kidnapped when he is eleven and found when he is fourteen. This book is not for the faint of heart, it contains graphic descriptions of molestation and the horrid desires in the lives of pedophiles. It also made me think of all this news coverage of the girls, the role of news reporters and the lack of privacy these young women will face. Caleb goes through the same things, he cannot even go for a bike ride without someone stalking him trying to get a picture with their phone. His family has crumbled during his absence, and even after his return they are unable to any type of cohesive family life. Caleb's mom, without his dad, takes him and his younger sister to live in Costa Rica with their grandmother, where she is hoping for privacy and a chance to start over.This book was very hard to read,not because of the writing which is very good but I try never to read books about pedphiles but in this case I felt drawn to find out how this family would end up. The reader only learns what happened to Caleb, in bits and pieces from Caleb himself. His family had been told to let Caleb tell his story only when he is comfortable doing so. This book gave me quite a bit to think about, but it is also a visit to the dark side, and in a way I wish I had not gone there."}, {"userName": "Keith Davis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2439329-keith-davis", "userReview": "Where You Can Find Me opens with the reunion of a family with their son three years after he was kidnapped by pedophiles. Joseph wisely does not spend a lot of time recounting the horrors of Caleb's captivity. She is more interested in the complex relationships within his damaged family. Caleb's mother, who has a history of substance abuse predating the kidnapping, decides on the fly to uproot her family and move to Costa Rica to escape the media spotlight. The father is willingly left behind as he is deeply uncomfortable around a son that he considers to be a stranger.There is some real psychological complexity here, especially regarding the son's ambivalent relationship with his former kidnapper. Caleb refuses to testify against the man he calls Jolly whom he believes rescued him from more abusive captors. Jolly is a manipulator and manages to contact Caleb, whom he calls Nicky, and attempts to lure him back into his profoundly messed up world.Joseph's novel is not exactly a fun read. It deals with long term psychological trauma and the hidden world of sex trafficking. After reading this I think I would like to read a nice fantasy novel with some wizards in it."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael", "userReview": "Caleb Vincent disappears without warning, leaving his loved ones worried. Although he is happy living in a home, his reserved personality causes everyone else to get suspicious. They are not only protective over him, but they want him to stay indoors. Caleb adjusts to a different lifestyle without the presence of his mother, it is both relieving & distressing. Caleb has a good support system around him but he longs to be independent. In addition, conflicts arises when Caleb can't take feeling isolated and starts to make his own decisions.I had a very difficult time rating this book. The first intial pages were luring, it was almost heartbreaking to see how wounded Caleb was. The characters were very sympathic, it was believable to see what role they played in the story. In contrast,the story was inconsistent towards the end. I lost focus on what the story was about,it kept switching viewpoints.However, I will say it was a solid three and look forward to reading more novels by Joseph."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2146300-peter", "userReview": "In _Where You Can Find Me_, Sheri Joseph offers one possible answer to one of those questions I have always had: what happens after a lost or abducted child somehow finds his or her way home? What happens when the thrill and relief of finding the child alive is slowly replaced by trying to figure out who the child has become? The process Caleb and his family goes through is complicated and wrenching, all the more so because of how attached we get to each these characters--characters we love in spite of, or maybe because of, their flaws.All that may sound heavy, but there's a light touch in Joseph's wonderful imagery, and moments of wonder and beauty buried in the Costa Rican setting.

This is a digital ARC. Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for the opportunity to read and review this book.This is not the type of book I typically read. After reading some of the reviews, I didn't know if I could read it. The subject matter is very, very, very difficult. When a child goes missing, all of us feel for the parents and maybe hug our own children a little longer for awhile. But, after awhile the child becomes \"just another missing kid\". The media attention goes away and we all move on with our lives. But, what happens to the parents of a missing child once the investigation stalls? This story explores a little bit of that angle, but has the positive aspect of having the child returned home after a three year absence. Caleb was eleven when he was abducted. He was missing for three years. Now he is home and his family is trying to adjust to this new development. Naturally, this is not a happily ever after situation. Marlene, Caleb's mother, is an emotionally immature woman, but despite her issues, she made her entire life about finding her son and bringing him home. Now that that has happened, she doesn't know how to stop looking for him. Jeff, Caleb's father, wants Caleb to be the same boy he was before the abduction. He is also dealing with the lack of tenacity his wife had while Caleb was missing. Jeff felt like the best thing for everyone was to believe Caleb was gone for good, probably dead. But, Marlene would not give up on her child. So, now that Caleb is back, Jeff is sort of left out of the healing process.Lark, is Caleb's younger sister. She is a positive girl. She is able to adjust to whatever life throws at her. But, she suffers in silence mostly. She was closest to her father, but wants to have a relationship with Caleb again.Once Caleb is found the media once again swarms. He is locked up in his home with no chance of going to school or resuming a \"normal\" life. So, his mother decided they would move to Costa Rica where her mother in law has invested in an old hotel. The bulk of the story takes place here as Caleb struggles to find out who he is. Is he Caleb, or does his alter ego- Nicky- the name he used when he was \"gone\", have the stronger hold on him?He struggles with letting go of the bond that he still feels for the man who saved him from a worse situation, making him feel grateful even.He is also haunted by others he encountered while he was \"gone\". This book is not one of those books you will want to read again and again. You will never pull it out and say this is a favorite book. It's a one and done type of book.I think it was a real look at the damage this type of crime does to the entire family. The wounds that never heal, the strength we find we have even through our weaknesses, and how we sometimes have to forget about the path we started on and go down the path we find ourselves on and do the best we can.Sometimes, no doubt, you will find yourself judging Marlene and the decisions she makes. She isn't the perfect mother by any means. But, she is human. She makes mistakes, puts her own needs first at times, forgets her daughter, is unsure of herself and second guesses decisions a lot. But, really, there isn't a manual for these situations. Her husband, in my opinion, was basically useless to her. She was on her own except for her FBI friend, but even he begins to distance himself once other cases begin to take up his time.Lowell, is not the best substitution for a father. But, he is there and Caleb seems to respond to him far better than his own father. The struggles Caleb goes through though are the most heart wrenching. Your heart just breaks for him. The ending holds out hope for Caleb that he will find himself and will have some peace at last. No, it's not perfect, but Marlene had it right I think. Normal was never going to be a possibility again. To accept that, showed a perception most of us wouldn't be able to accept. I must admit that I struggled through this one. I didn't have that anticipation I normally do when I get ready to sit down to read. In fact, I heaved a sigh of relief when the book was finished. This is not the type of book I am drawn to in most cases and I am in no hurry to ever jump back into this type of storyline.But, the book was well written and once I did settle in to read, I found myself absorbed in the marital dramas and the adventures the kids were involved in.I do recommend this book, if you are strong enough to get through the horror Caleb went through and psychological torment he was still dealing with. This is a fascinating study in what could be an all to real scenario for some. You would hope and pray for the return of a missing child, but for this family the drama was just beginning.Overall this one gets an A."}, {"userName": "Michelle Lancaster", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18869661-michelle-lancaster", "userReview": "\u201cNormal was a false god\u2026\u201d \u2013 Marlene VincentCaleb Vincent was eleven years old when he was abducted. Three years later the FBI has found him and returned him to his family in suburban Atlanta. As Caleb is hounded by the media and voyeurs and faces the beginning of high school, any degree of freedom seems impossible. His mother Marlene decides to move the children far from prying, prurient eyes to her mother-in-law\u2019s farm in the Cloud Forest of Costa Rica. The family adjusts to a new life in Costa Rica with some success. They learn Spanish, enroll in school and make friends \u2013 a semblance of normalcy. But then the past comes calling and Caleb is forced to choose whether he will remain with his family, with which he no longer feels sure he belongs, or return to the life he came to know when he was taken.Where You Can Find Me by Sheri Joseph is a stunning psychological portrait of a family in the wake of tragedy and an unflinching exploration of their attempts to move forward. The maelstrom of conflicting emotions Caleb must carefully pick his way through is excruciating. Who is he now? Is he gay or straight? Is he permanently damaged? Is the person he used to be gone forever? Does he even deserve to be back with his family? Must fundamentally: is he good or bad?While the premise of Where You Can Find Me is not particularly original \u2013 there have been several books in the last few years about kids who are returned \u2013 the author\u2019s treatment of her subject sets her work apart. Josef does not shy from uncomfortable facts or emotional dilemmas that will make you squirm but neither does she present them in a lascivious fashion. Her goal is not to shock you but rather to coax you into considering the situation without knee-jerk reactions. Rich with insight, Josef\u2019s prose is candid, but respectful, and her ability to imagine the profound cross-currents in this situation and engender empathy in circumstances that most of us can\u2019t personally relate to, is remarkable.The characters in Where You Can Find Me are well-defined and believable. You can tell when characters are individual and complex because they are flawed. You won\u2019t always like the characters in this novel. Marlene can be flighty and irresponsible; Jeff can be reserved when he ought to be offering more of himself; little Lark, Caleb\u2019s younger sister, is an anxious perfectionist who tries desperately to be mature beyond her years but, perversely, this sometimes lends her the peevish air of a petulant toddler.As horrific and impressive are the large plot points in Where You Can Find Me, it\u2019s the small details in this story that bring you up short and convey the magnitude of the changes each family member has endured. The simplest acts are fraught with possible pitfalls. \u201cAt the table that had been purchased the same year as the house, they sat for dinner, unable to remember who sat where.\u201d Caleb\u2019s father watched his son play the piano and wearing his glasses, neither of which he did before he was taken, and struggled to relate to this child as he is now, not as he was. \u201cHe was healthy, polite, so clearly present in his watchful way behind those glasses, and yet. Whose child was this? Over time, some tether must have snapped. Or had Jeff only let it go? The boy in his house belonged to others, \u2026\u201dWhile the concept for this novel is usually found in a thriller, this is not a suspenseful action-packed story. The pacing can be somewhat slow in places. Josef has crafted a psychologically complex narrative where everything exists in shades of gray. There are no black or white absolutes to be found anywhere. If you prefer stories that deal in moral absolutes with clear good guys and bad guys you might want to look elsewhere. But if you feel like challenging yourself or are more comfortable with realism than parable, I highly recommend Where You Can Find Me.Published in South85 Journal, Fall/Winter 2014"}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5368718-jackie", "userReview": "This book kept my interest enough to finish the book but I didn't like the book.

I found it a particularly poignant read in light of the recent barrage of publicity about the young women who were found in Cleveland, Ohio after 10 years in captivity. There is no mistaking the impact of our insatiable media on people in this sort of spotlight, or the challenges of those trying to readjust. The novel opens as 14 year old Caleb is trying to settle in with his family. He went missing as an 11 year old, the same age his sister is now. His mother literally flees the country with him and his sister in order to try to heal.The theme is a grim one, but I disagree with those who found it graphic: if anything, the author skates quite carefully over the details of what he might have experienced, giving the reader just the smallest taste, and that toward the very end of the book.What she does exceptionally well is chart the inner struggles of a boy who no longer knows what is 'normal', who worries that he may have been at fault, that his family can no longer love him, who isn't sure where he belongs anymore.She captures well the stresses on his family: a mother who threw herself into the search for her missing child so absolutely that she hardly knows how to function now that he is found; a father struggling with guilt over having 'given up' the boy for dead, a sister tippy-toeing through the minefield of all their anxieties. I sometimes lost patience with the too-modern family (I wanted to hiss \"Grow up, already\" at Caleb's parents, uncle and grandmother!) but it is hard to imagine how ANY of us would react in a situation as dramatic as this one. This was a leisurely read, twisty and challenging. I found it reassuring that the author was able to give us some hope in the end: Caleb eventually finds that he DOES know where he belongs, and is able to make useful choices. There is a sense that love can heal even these astonishing wounds. People survive such ordeals and sometimes reemerge whole, if changed.A remarkable undertaking"}, {"userName": "Ionia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16434239-ionia", "userReview": "I feel really divided over this book. The writing was beautiful. The author clearly has a way with words that can easily overwhelm the reader with emotion. I think her style is unique and from a literary standpoint, absolutely amazing. On the other hand, this is a sad book, where there will never be much triumph in the resolution. The damage has been done and it is the kind that can't ever just 'go away,' even with the passage of time. So here goes. I loved the writing, but I HATED and I say this with every fiber of my being HATED the subject matter. I respect what the author accomplished in telling this story, and her characters become deeply ingrained into your heart and soul as you read her words, but this was too intense and explicit for my personal taste. I do understand that pedophiles exist. I also understand that things we, as parents, would never wish on anyone's children can happen to our own, but this book flat out disgusted me at times. There were points in the book where I quite honestly wanted to slap the parents. I won't spoil it for others, but I will say that no matter what a psychologist told me to do or not to do, I would follow my own heart when making decisions about the life of my child. If you have the heart to finish this book and not want to murder things, you might be the kind of person who could really enjoy this completely. For me, I enjoyed the writing style of the author and the thought she put into her characters, but still think this book was a terribly disheartening experience. The author does show throughout the book how the family has to make adjustments in order to survive when their son, who has been changed so much returns. She does a brilliant job of making us believe in her characters individual realities. Personally, I found it to be more real than I could handle. The end was somewhat abrupt, but for once, I was glad. Of course I would have liked a happy ending, most people do, but in this case, I was just happy to move on to something less emotionally taxing.

He had formed a loving relationship with Jolly, the man who rescued him from the abusive pedophile who kidnapped him, but it isn't a healthy bond. This is a book filled with pain. The characters have been through a devastating experience and are trying to come to terms with it. The three years spent searching for Caleb effectively tore the family apart, and they seem unable to come together again. Although they feel it's a miracle Caleb is back, his return from the horrible experiences of his kidnapping are as hard for the family to deal with as his absence. This is not an easy book to read. The author has captured the tortured emotions of the estranged parents extremely well, so well in fact that the scenes in the book are very painful.

However, despite the subject matter the book is never sensationalist, exploitative or didactic; indeed the author handles the matter with an objectivity which strips away the reader's instinctive emotional response and portrays a world, and its inhabitants, where moral compasses are ambiguous. That is not to say that the core issue is not taken seriously - indeed there are definite 'bad guys' here, but the novel acknowledges that there is not always a clear-cut definition of hero and villain, depending on perspective. This is encapsulated in the character of 'Jolly' aka 'Charles Lundy' a doctor who 'rescues' the young protagonist, Caleb (or Nicky as he is known in captivity) from a brutal and depraved paedophile ring, having been abducted at the age of 11. However, despite this seemingly altruistic act, Jolly tells Caleb that his parents are no longer looking for him and keeps him at his own house for a further 18 months before the FBI trace him. Jolly\u2019s motives - and how exactly he obtained Caleb from the ring - are never made clear. The character of Jolly is mainly seen in flashback, through the prism of Caleb's memories - and Caleb's own perspective is never clear-cut; is he suffering from a form of Stockholm Syndrome in insisting that Jolly 'saved' him? Was he also abused by Jolly? Difficult questions.The book opens with Caleb, now 14, returned to his parents and younger sister Lark by the FBI after being rescued. What should be an ecstatic reunion is, inevitably, a confused and difficult process for all concerned. Caleb is not the boy who disappeared 3 years before and the family and Caleb struggle to work through this. Caleb's father Jeff, especially struggles to connect having given Caleb up for dead - a fact that has led to a deep rift between him and Caleb's mother, Marlene. Caleb himself is unsettled and self-conscious being, as he sees it, ripped from the protective bubble that Jolly had kept him in and still traumatised by his previous experiences.What impressed me most about this work is how the core plot of Caleb\u2019s return is used, through the various characters, to explore issues of identity in various ways. This is most obviously seen in Caleb, who was not only known as \u2018Nicky\u2019 during his captivity, but inhabited Nicky as an alter-ego as a sort of defence mechanism \u2013 a persona he finds it hard to let go of. Marlene has also undergone a change in moving on from drug and alcohol addiction during Caleb\u2019s disappearance to a decisive role in moving the family to Costa Rica to avoid the US media glare. Jeff\u2019s identity is as a husband and father is challenged by Caleb\u2019s return in less positive ways \u2013 Marlene cannot forgive him for giving Caleb up for dead and Jeff himself fails to connect with the newly-returned Caleb as a father; a role that falls to his wayward brother in Costa Rica, Lowell, whilst Jeff remains in the US.Costa Rica itself is portrayed as a challenging place of extreme beauty (the main setting is the 'Cloud Forest\u2019 nature reserve of Monteverde), occasional tedium (the place is shrouded in damp cloud and rain for long periods) and flashes of danger (Lowell\u2019s mysterious and possibly illegal \u2018business\u2019, escaped jaguars, and the ever-present active volcano). The descriptions of the scenery draw the reader into the landscape and mood of Costa Rica and emphasise that here Costa Rica is more than just a backdrop; it is a catalyst that changes all who arrive there.A challenging read then due to its unflinching treatment of a difficult subject (much of which is hinted at rather than overtly described, and is all the more effective for that), but ultimately one that draws you into the lives of ordinary, flawed, individuals dealing with an extraordinary situation. That such dark subject matter forms the basis of an ultimately redemptive story is testament to the quality of writing here..."}, {"userName": "Amanda Savig", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6826208-amanda-savig", "userReview": "Won this in a giveaway a few years ago and I\u2019m finally able to write a review for it.

At eleven years old, Caleb Vincent is kidnapped, used by a brutal pedophile, only to be kidnapped and hidden away again by a man he looks to as his savior. When Caleb is found and returned home at fourteen years old, he knows he is changed forever, unable to communicate with these strangers that were once his family. In an effort to keep her family safe, Caleb\u2019s mother spirits both Caleb and his sister Lark off to live with their paternal grandmother and uncle in Costa Rica. The longer they spend time here, the more the family breaks down, devolving into another \u2018broken home\u2019 statistic as Caleb\u2019s parents fall further and further apart. Feeling desperate to feel normal, or at least safe, Caleb secretly reconnects with Jolly, his savior. Reliving their shared past, Caleb\u2019s confused feelings of love for and dependence on Jolly grows, both promising to meet up again, soon. Will Caleb return to the shelter of Jolly\u2019s love, knowing it isn\u2019t healthy, but wanting it, anyway?Although the story is centralized around the aftermath of the kidnapping, the obvious flaws in every character glares out in shocking detail, causing me to wonder if Caleb could ever heal within his family\u2019s dysfunctional environment. Where You Can Find Me isn\u2019t an easy read. Beautifully written, the gamut of emotions fly off the pages. What is implied between the lines is more horrendous than what is actually written, truly an eye-opening and thought-provoking experience that is uncomfortable to think about. As a piece of literary work, it is brilliant!Fore more book related things Please visit:\n\n\nThis ARC copy of Where You Can Find Me was given to me by St. Martin's Press - Thomas Dunne Books in exchange for a honest review.

The mother, Marlene, takes Caleb and his sister to stay at their grandmother\u2019s house to escape the hoopla about Caleb\u2019s return. The media cannot get enough of his story and she is frustrated about her family\u2019s inability to move on after this situation. Caleb\u2019s father decides to stay behind since marital discord is tearing this family apart, mostly due to Marlene\u2019s reaction to the kidnapping.Caleb is a confused teenager facing identity issues due to the situations he encountered while away with his captors. There are hints of abuse and exploitation, but he considers his last captor, Jolly, to be somewhat of a savior. While in Costa Rica, his mother is able to make a life for herself, while her husband stays behind and plays a minor role in their life. It\u2019s strange how comfortable she is living with her mother -in-law and brother-in-law whom she seems to have had previous involvement. Caleb\u2019s sister has dreamed of this opportunity and is now glad they have decided to move to this cloud forest I in Monteverde she had longed to preserve. She attends school with Caleb and attempts to understand his situation, while trying to enjoy moments with him, too.This novel seems to drag with situations involving the mother\u2019s actions. The plot moves at a faster pace at the beginning, but lags throughout the rest of it. Moments of symbolism or metaphors that a reader usually discovers on his or her own are analyzed by the mother in situations of dialogue with other characters. This is the author\u2019s method of having the mother realize what is occurring to her son and his situation. After being gone for years and now a stranger to a normal way of life, Caleb does not have any outbursts about his struggles, he internally debates his conflicts. This novel could have been shorter and led readers to discover Caleb\u2019s insecurities without extending situations with the mother\u2019s employment."}, {"userName": "DarcyAnne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18440458-darcyanne", "userReview": "I received this book as a Goodreads Giveaway First Reads book.I was extremely surprised by this book. For a while, I wondered where it was leading and what exactly was happening. Warning, it may not immediately draw you in. The plot is intriguing and it falls together fantastic\u2026but it moves slowly. Sheri tells the day to day life of a would be real family, not every moment was exciting. It does pick up! And it does draw you in!The story, one of Caleb who was kidnapped when he was 11 and now returning home at 14, is fascinating. We view the story from his younger sisters point of view, the mother\u2019s, occasionally the father\u2019s, mostly Caleb\u2019s and see how they all adjust to having him home again. This book isn\u2019t something anyone can pick up for just light reading, it has intensely emotional moments and moments to step back and wonder what the hell is going on? There are several questionable situations Sheri Joseph throws at the reader, situations not easily forgotten.I honestly did not think I would like this book at first. It started slow, was just a day to day journal, but then I kept reading. I finished the book and started thinking about it. It doesn\u2019t have some big Blockbuster hit ending, so don\u2019t look for it. Yet, Sheri Joseph shows us survival in its raw form. Marlene has no idea how to hold the family together, has no idea how to act the mother figure anymore. Can she even really be Caleb\u2019s \u201cmother\u201d anymore? Caleb is old enough, and willing enough, that he can just walk out the door anytime he pleases and no one would ever find him. Every day is terrifying. Caleb has to wake up from his dream of being with Jolly or lose everything he\u2019s created in Costa Rica. For this newly created family unit to have survived everything and still love each other, unconditionally, it says a lot. I would highly recommend this book to many people but due to some of the content, probably 13+."}, {"userName": "Denisa Howe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17011816-denisa-howe", "userReview": "sheri Joseph brought us a very complex plot and made us face the reality of a child that has been kidnapped. The story starts with Caleb\u2019s returning home after being in the care of a pedophile number one, and the care of another man who in Caleb\u2019s mind saved him. Starting out with Caleb returning home was certainly a new twist although not having the background, made it a bit frustrating at times to understand what was going on. This is not a book for the faint at heart to read. The descriptions of what Caleb endured are very sharp and at times blunt, but that is how it is in real life.The characters are developed mostly very well. Lark who is Caleb\u2019s sister seems to follow him around through most of the book and you have conversation but other than her interaction with Caleb, there is very little to who she really is. The parents struggle with how to cope and with their own marriage not on good standing to begin with. The mom and children relocate because of the media swarms and life begins in a different way.The book does not hint around at what happened to Caleb, it tells it and the behaviors known to these types of predators. It is a true, hard blunt dark telling, just as it is in real life. At times the book moved very slowly with pages of conversation that said very little, other times the pace picked up and gave you more of the story. The ending was rather abrupt causing a bit of \u201cWhat?\u201d. Although this piece could never end in a perfect everything fixed mode, it could have answered at least of the questions. Maybe the family goes on to a second book.The writer actually has a very nice style of writing and play with the words. The plot was intriguing and kept my interest, but the format through me off into a slower pace.

As I write my review, I will try not to released information regarding the storyline so you may read it to form your own opinion.As I mentioned, I won this in a GoodReads giveaway in June/July 2013. However the book cover has a graphic on it listing \"Advance Readers' Edition ; on sale April 2013.\" At first I thought this was cool. However, I found it to be a difficult and confusing read; grammar at times was poor, multiple thoughts (even conflicting at times) were presented at once and the topic jumped around.As a start, Chapter 1 was quite confusing... However a few chapters in, the story still seemed to drag a little, but it slowly held my interest. This occurred in multiple chapters/sections, though did not last long for the story was still confusing in areas.I think the reason I was so confused was that the background of each character was not presented in the beginning to set the story. Rather its throughout as pieces of their lives/story evolve.It took me until half way through the book to realize Caleb and Nicky are the same person; not happy it took this long. I also wish the date was included in the beginning of each chapter (like Chapter 1) to help with my understanding of the time.I did like that Joseph acknowledged the research she did in creating the story. It's good to know an author looks into all their topics (location details, tough topic details, environment, etc.) in order to try and depict their vision to the reader.Again, throughout most of the story I was just confused in trying to \"keep up\" and understand the topic(s) unfolding at hand. However, it was \"An advanced copy.\" (Though there was no note as \"warning to the reader.\") GoodReads lists this story to contain 336 pages, my copy holds 325 pages.

This was a well written novel about a subject we hear, read, and see everyday. A child, Caleb, in the family was abducted and missing for over 3 years. Happily he is found and returned to his family. They are left to pick up the pieces and proceed with life again with him in it. The novel describes how hard it is for the parents and the younger sister to relate to Caleb and all he has been through. The mother is understandably ready to close up around Caleb like a turtle and never let him out of the shell. He wants to go outside and go to school and just be normal and the book very quickly demonstrates how disastrous that could be. Mother and father tip-toe around Caleb learning how he's different and wondering everything that might have happened to him. Sister Lark is less cautious more happy to welcome him as a brother and friend rather than wonder on the big grown up issues. The relationship they develop is sweet and deeper than it probably would have been normally considering the age gap. My biggest complaint about the novel was the parents. I never cared for Marlene and didn't like Jeff a whole lot better. I found Marlene irrational: moving the kids to a whole new country to escape the public and press was very extreme. Moving while her husband was unable to join them seemed heartless since he just got his son back too. The attraction with the agent assigned to the case. The history of drug use and addiction while not seeking help. She just really irritated me to no end. I realize that everyone deals with grief differently and that substance use was probably her way but it annoyed me. Like I said, the premise was interesting and well executed. I probably would have liked the novel more if I had liked the characters more.
