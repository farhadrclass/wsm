First her mother died than her betrothed was killed in the Civil War and her faith was shaken.I felt the story got off to a bit of a slow start but that may have been unavoidable as the author has to set up a certain scenario which will play out later. Eliza's preacher father stands against racial prejudice in the Waco, TX and is seen by many as a northern sympathizer. Texas had sided with the south in the Civil War. With Union soldiers patrolling Waco and tensions running high, he sends Eliza to live with her aunt for safety sake.The pace picks up when Eliza arrives in New Mexico where it seems life can be just as harsh as she'd experienced before. The author paints an excellent picture of the lawlessness of the early west. As a historical suspense writer, I appreciate what had to be voluminous research on the author's part."}, {"userName": "Terri Harr", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5227214-terri-harr", "userReview": "I got this book on my new Kindle because of the reference to the Sangre de Cristo mountains. I fell in love with those mountains in Colorado. The part of them in this story are actually in New Mexico. This was a wonderful book. The characters are great. This is a book about loss and starting over. God sees our whole lives from start to finish but we can't see how certain things are going to work for good like He can. It is also a book about how we can be a light to others in the world. We can make a difference even if it is just planting a small seed. God can use that small seed and bring it into full bloom."}, {"userName": "Krisi Keley", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3994950-krisi-keley", "userReview": "Wonderful action/adventure historical romance!

Her fiance had been killed in the war and she feels lost and without purpose. Her father who is a pastor convinces her to move to New Mexico to live with her aunt and uncle so she can rebuild her life. In New Mexico, she's confronted the reality of gold mining town, a little boy who suffers physical and emotional abuse from his father, and challenges which test her courage, faith, and strength. There is a sweet love story.Strengths: I like how the author portrayed the struggle of Eliza to rebuild her life and seek for purpose and meaning in her life without a husband or children, both of which she desperately wishes for. Eliza struggles with her faith and wants to be faithful and trusting in God. The characters were well-developed. Genuine grief and joy are portrayed convincingly. Perhaps one of the greatest strengths of the book is how Eliza, at great risk to herself, seeks to help others. The sub-plot of helping a young Indian/white boy is compelling and interesting. Weaknesses: The love story itself is tender and sweet. However, the author creates a series of coincidences that are too over-the-top to believe and aren't convincing, and only serve to weaken the love story. I found Eliza's constant attempts to rationalize how God has a hand in every aspect of her life unconvincing. Perhaps that runs counter to my own beliefs about how choice operates. I don't think God always intervenes in matters of life and death and allows things to happen because we are mortal and make choices and then have to live with the consequences. That said, I do believe that God can and does turn sorrows and tragedy into blessings if we allow Him to do so and are humble. However, my own contrary opinions aside, I imagine the average LDS reader wouldn't be bothered by this.The love story felt rushed in that Eliza's new love had barely been a widower for 8 months. But I'm willing to cut a little slack for the author in this one because while it did seem rushed, it wasn't entirely unbelievable. And finally, the title of the book is just a cliche. When finishing this review Goodreads pulled up other books with the same title and the list was just a little too long. But this may or may not be the fault of the author.This book is solid but not remarkable."}, {"userName": "Sabrina Guthrie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9935988-sabrina-guthrie", "userReview": "A truly inspirational read. God proves that even through tragedy, life can be filled with many riches. This was a tragically beautiful story filled with heart ache, war, prejudice, but most importantly forgiveness. It was an amazing love story about starting over.
