For those who are interested in how the creative process grows within a person from young childhood through to adulthood, this book is perfect.Thea Kronborg is born in Moonstone, Colorado and is part of a large Swedish family of seven children and an Aunt who helps their mother maintain some semblance of order in their tiny, over-crowded home. It is her Aunt Tillie who first declares Thea to be something special. Thea\u2019s mother also senses this daughter\u2019s higher destiny but has six other children she must also encourage toward fulfillment.Dr. Howard Archie is young and trapped in a bad marriage where he struggles to maintain dignity and the respect of the townspeople by putting the best face on it. Dr. Archie is one of Thea\u2019s first friends outside of the family who can also see something interesting in young Thea, although he cannot put a name to it.Thea\u2019s calling and her inner torments in achieving what she feels driven to achieve are central to this marvelous story. Along the way, there is a sojourn in New Mexico where she goes to recover herself at one point, and the descriptions and writing soar into and throughout the canyons like birds catching a thermal. Sunrises, sunsets, storms, hot days, cool nights, the cliffs with deserted homes built along both sides of the canyons like long, suspended city streets \u2013 all are so vividly painted, they are palatable to the senses.Eventually, when Thea recovers her equilibrium and her renewed strong will and determination drive her onward once more, Thea goes to Germany to hone her craft. One of her teachers says to her,\u2019When people, serious people, believe in you, they give you some of their best, so \u2013 take care of it, Miss Kronborg.\u2019Thea takes this to heart and although she continues to meet people who do have that belief in her, she struggles with letting go of the people who could only hold her back, even without meaning to. There is one internal engine, however, that keeps pushing her toward her goals, and only those who recognize it for what it is will continue to share her journey.You may or may not be surprised to learn what it is that ensures her success where so many others fail, and there are also some surprises in discovering which people will always be part of her life and lifestyle.I enjoyed this book a great deal as I could relate to so much of it personally, even though I know very little about the world of Opera. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys music on any level and/or is interested in \u2013 or curious about \u2013 the nurturing and development of the creative process within."}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "[As much as \u00c1ntonia warmed my wistful heart in My \u00c1ntonia, her development as an independent human being was finally curtailed by the solemn aura of her femininity because it ended trapping her in the role of ultimate incarnation as some kind of \u201cearth mother\u201d. Contrarily, Thea renounces to her personal life and sacrifices having a family because she has a dream to pursue, which is also a heavy burden and an enormous responsibility, regardless of the consequences of taking the path that leads her to the art she believes to be locked inside herself, ebullient to flare up if the right igniter flashes the desired, needed spark.In O Pioneers!, free-spirited Alexandra proves she is worth her weight in gold when it comes to stating her position as a successful entrepreneur without the shadow of a male presence to influence her decisions, but she proves to be severe and rushed to judge illicit love within the framework of social convention of a highly questionable morality.In contrast, Thea doesn\u2019t renounce to her self-respect but at the same time her open-mindedness allows her to accept, and even empathize with people of dubious propriety, for she challenges the generally accepted norm and forms an opinion based on her personal experience alone.

Life rushed in upon her through that window - or so it seemed. In reality, of course, life rushes from within, not from without. There is no work of art so big or so beautiful that it was not once all contained in some youthful body, like this one which lay on the floor in the moonlight, pulsing with ardour and anticipation.\"With exquisite prose, Willa Cather conveys what it means to be an artist and the journey one takes to realize a dream. Using the backdrop of the immense plains and the awe-inspiring canyons, Cather likens the power of the artist's progress to the quest of the early pioneers into the awesome vastness of the West. The descriptions of the landscape of Colorado and the Southwest are simply breathtaking. The drive of the artist, the despair, the struggles, the sacrifices, and the triumphs are compelling.Daughter of a minister, Thea Kronborg is born into a large family and from an early age one recognizes her individuality and her spirit. Thea begins her musical journey by taking piano lessons from a down and out musician, Wunsch, who wandered into town on the heels of the local vagrant, Spanish Johnny. She befriends those much older than herself, including the aforementioned eccentrics as well as the resident physician, Doctor Archie, and a railway man, Ray Kennedy. Her talent is steadfastly supported by her mother and admired by her somewhat flighty, spinster aunt. I adored the young Thea - her openness, her freedom, her youthful earnestness, and her vitality. A poignant turn of events gives Thea the opportunity she needs to make the next step in her early career. Traveling to Chicago, she continues her piano training until her voice is eventually discovered to be her true calling. On the brink of grasping what it really means to be an artist and a singer, Thea travels to Arizona upon the urging of a somewhat self-indulgent and wealthy young man, Fred Ottenburg. Communing with nature and the spirits of the ancient Native Americans, Thea undergoes another transformation. \"Panther Canyon was the home of innumerable swallows. They built nests in the wall far above the hollow groove in which Thea's own rock-chamber lay. They seldom ventured above the rim of the canyon, to the flat, wind-swept tableland. Their world was the blue air-river between the canyon walls. In that blue gulf the arrow-shaped birds swam all day long, with only an occasional movement of the wings. The only sad thing about them was their timidity: the way in which they lived their lives between the echoing cliffs and never dared to rise out of the shadow of the canyon walls. As they swam past her door, Thea often felt how easy it would be to dream one's life out in some cleft in the world.\"The way in which Thea evolves as a true artist comes with a price. Leaving behind family and friends - not just physically but also emotionally, and lacking true companionship \u2013 must one suffer this to reach the destination, to achieve fame? Can these things be overcome? What will ultimately become of Thea? Must cherished memories be left behind or can one experience the joy of more carefree days when there were endless possibilities? I believe these questions are not exclusive to the artist; perhaps these are questions pertinent to any human being that once had a dream. What I loved most about this novel were the descriptions of the great outdoors - the plains, the canyons, and the grandeur of the heavens. I did not necessarily like the older Thea, although I continued to root for her. She was thoroughly believable. I cherished those persons that encouraged Thea and gave her the best of their own selves to help her along the way - especially Doctor Archie. Doctor Archie, he really did 'get it'! \"It came over him now that the unexpected favours of fortune, no matter how dazzling, do not mean very much to us. They may excite us or divert us for a time, but when we look back, the only things we cherish are those which in some way met our original want; the desire which formed us in early youth, undirected, and of its own accord.\""}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "Most mornings I wake to the songs of larks, so when Christmas Eve found us stuck inside of our home because of flooding (my front and back yards were pines in ponds), I chose to hear The Song of the Lark in words. This is my third Cather book this year and after having been introduced to her works intimately, I can now safely say that curling up with a Cather book will always be a good choice.However, this book is not about the song of birds. It is a book that celebrates finding one's muse; in fact, the picture on my cover is significant of a French painting in the Chicago Art Museum, \"a picture in which a little peasant girl, on her way to work in the fields at early morning, stops and looks up to listen to a lark.\" \nShe liked even the name, \"The Song of the Lark.\" The flat country, the early morning light, the wet fields, the look in the girl's heavy face--well, they were all hers, anyhow, whatever was there. She told herself that that picture was \"right.\" Just what she meant by this, it would take a clever person to explain. But to her the word covered the almost boundless satisfaction she felt when she looked at the picture.\nThe Song of the Lark seems to signify artistic and creative freedom, the kind of freedom that Thea Kronborg, the main character, seeks. \nIt was over flat lands like this, stretching out to drink the sun, that the larks sang--and one's heart sang there, too.\nThea stretches out from her small town to \"drink the sun\" in the big city of Chicago, going from a piano teacher to a pianist, and finally, a famous singer. Her relationships with Dr. Archie, the town's doctor who at some point sees her as the daughter he's never had, and with Fred Ottenburg, her married lover, are interesting elements that bind the story, which centers around independence and creativity. Cather chooses a singer to embody creative freedom, but one can't help but think of this book as a celebration of the creative fulfillment that places one outside of 'the box:'\nIt's waking up every morning with the feeling that your life is your own, and your strength is your own, and your talent is your own; that you're all there, and there's no sag in you.\nI didn't enjoy this one as much as I did, My Antonia, because the omniscient narration was a distant one and the prose style seemed much unlike the one in that novel. There are also some things about the story that could be easily missed if one doesn't pause to read the epilogue, and an off-putting shift in the main character's personality towards the end (I'm all for awakening and struggle that brings about success, but the arrogance that came after - meh). Yet Cather has such a unique way of encapsulating self realization through story, that I know I can always look forward to her strong-minded and slightly peculiar female characters."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa", "userReview": "At some point in this novel, I imagined a subtitle for it: \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman,\" especially as I'm convinced (without any facts to back it up) that it contains many autobiographical elements. I imagined that Thea's being different from the rest of her family, and from the others in the area she grew up in and loved, to be similar to Cather's experience as a burgeoning writer, also feeling the creative urge when she was a young child in her heart, was it, or under her cheek?... that sturdy little companion with whom she shared a secret. Cather does a phenomenal job embodying how it might feel for any true artist: growing, despairing, caring deeply and passionately about her craft, succeeding by the world's standards but still reaching for an unachievable ideal. Though Thea's growth as an artist takes her to two major cities, Cather's depiction of the West is what stays with one. Gorgeous prose describes the cliff-dwellings of Arizona where time slows down and heals Thea. It later becomes an ironic contrast to the high-rise apartments of New York City. I was surprised by the ending that takes us back to Thea's hometown and to one of her relatives. It was so lyrical, especially those last two beautiful sentences, that I forgot my initial reaction of pity for this relative, as that is not at all what Cather wants us to feel."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "3.5 starsI love how this book portrays an empowered woman who achieves success as a singer though her talent, work ethnic, and independence. This type of coming-of-age story often only occurs with boys and men. Cather, however, follows her protagonist Thea throughout her childhood in eastern Colorado all the way up to her rising fame as an artist in New York. Thea defies the expectations placed on women to act docile and domestic; she prioritizes herself and her ambitions and thus has a happy ending. While some may accuse Thea of selfishness or ungratefulness, I would ask these readers: why do we not penalize men as much when they leave behind their loved ones for their work?I enjoyed dissecting so many themes in The Song of the Lark: the trappings of heteronormativity, the price we so often pay to succeed as artists, and how to integrate autonomy with the gift of amazing mentorship. While the writing style of the book sometimes bored me, Thea's ascent made the whole experience worth it. Recommended if you want a book about a girl who grows into a woman after overcoming challenges and displaying a courageous faith in herself."}, {"userName": "Ensiform", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform", "userReview": "Thea Kronborg, daughter of a minister in a small Colorado town, is discovered by the music teacher, a drunken German fellow, to have a rare gift. Sponsored by Archie, the town doctor and family friend, and Ray, a railroad man who intends to marry her but is killed, she travels to Chicago, then New Mexico, meeting more and more cosmopolitan people, until, at last, she is a star of the opera stage, and like a star radiant and very distant.I found this book, at 420+ pages, quite a chore to get through. The character of Thea was utterly unsympathetic; her self-absorption even as a nobody is insufferable, and after she's a star, her melodramatic requirements are equally odious. The prose is tedious, as Cather fawns on her character, making her charismatic in the eyes of everyone except the reader. Actually, Thea is surrounded by sympathetic characters who lead interesting lives and are open, hearty, and engaging, but they all orbit around her, and Cather gives no reason for the reader to like her.

Not often for me does a book's main character go from endearing at the beginning, to tiresome by the end of the book. I adored the young Thea Kronberg, even if playing piano and professional singing interest me not one iota. She was a bright, ambitious little thing and you knew she would make something of herself with those wonderful secondary characters to support and encourage her. But her inner drive and work ethic was what she, in the end, credits her success to; and her personality becomes almost diva-like. I still liked this book a lot, but it was slow in many parts. It did keep me guessing if she'd ever find love and true happiness. Not everyone or every woman, specifically, requires the same things to be happy. Not everyone is capable of the give and take of a relationship -- some can only take."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "We first meet Thea Kronborg through Dr Archie, the young doctor of Moonstone, Colorado. He would become the first of many to have hopes for Thea, Thea the outsider, who just didn't fit somehow in this small town or in the family of a pastor. Sometimes she didn't feel she fit in her own body.The story of The Song of the Lark is Thea's growth from child to teen to young adult to adult and we, the readers, share in the saga along with those who are her champions. Cather provides such a beautiful, insightful picture of the costs and glories of the search for that \"something\", the thing that will make life worth living. The stream and the broken pottery: what was any art but an effort to make a sheath, a mould in which to imprison  for a moment the shining, elusive element which is life  itself,---life hurrying past us and running away, too strong to stop, too sweet to lose?...In singing, one made a vessel of one\"s throat and nostrils and held it on one's breath, caught the stream in a scale of natural intervals. (p 227)It is tempting to see Cather herself in this, Cather discovering how to harness her words into form.Another character in this story is the Southwest itself, whether the sand hills of Colorado. the cliff houses of New Mexico or Thea's remembered weekend away with her father to Wyoming and the high mountains.The road they followed was a wild and beautiful one. It led up and up, by granite rocks and stunted pines, around  deep ravines and echoing gorges. The top of the ridge...was a great flat plain, strewn with white boulders, with the wind howling over it. There was not one trail, as Thea had expected; There were a score; deep furrows, cut in the earth by heavy wagon wheels, and now grown over with dry. whitish  grass. The furrows ran side by side; when one trail had been worn too deep, the next party had abandoned it and made a new trail to the right or left. They were, indeed, only old wagon ruts, running east and west, and grown over with grass.  But as Thea ran about among the white stones, her skirts  blowing this way and that, the wind brought to her eyes tears that might have come anyway....To the west one could see range after range of blue mountains, and at last the snowy range, with its white, windy peaks, the clouds caught here and there on their spurs. The wind never slept on this plain.... Every little while eagles flew over. (p 46)Here is Cather, with her love of history, love of the land, looking forward to progress as did those who came in the wagon trains. While it may not be an easy time, it is worth the struggle.

Through their help and support she's able to advance in the world of Wagnerian opera to become a world renowned diva. Willa Cather's skilled writing portrays Thea's inner ambitious aspirations as she leaves small town life behind and becomes exposed to the cosmopolitan influences of Chicago. Cather devises a detour in the narrative that takes Thea to Arizona where she emerges from a canyon flash flood probably symbolizing rebirth into a new life. The narrative then jumps forward ten years, and Thea has returned to New York from a circuit of European opera singing. She is on the cusp to breaking through from \"new young voice\" to recognized \"top tier voice\" when she receives the chance of a life-time. She receives a telephone call asking if she can come to the Metropolitan Opera immediately and finish a performance where the lead soprano has become ill after the first act and can't finish. Of course Thea performs magnificently and brings the house down with applause. (This is based on an actual occurrence in the life of Olive Fremstad.)The book is filled with extensive ruminations by Thea and others on subjects such as the struggle to release the potential that's hiding inside one's self. They are thoughts that most readers can relate to if they are able to recall the feeling of being young with all possibilities for the future open. Every step and decision along the path of life narrows the range of future possibilities. In Thea's case she senses a destiny for something special but isn't certain what it will be. At first she studies piano until her instructor discovers that she has a voice. She is told that she's and good pianist, but she has the potential to be a world-class singer.Normally, I as a reader would be completely engrossed in a rags to riches story and would be cheering for the success of the main character. But Thea as portrayed in the story isn't totally likable. She is a perfectionist who's insensitive to the feelings to others who are less talented. Her focused attention on her own skills deprives her of friendship of others her own age. But perhaps these personality flaws provide a realistic representation of the personal cost of being goal oriented on a career that requires total devotion. The following is a quotation toward the end of the book of Thea reflecting on her career: Your work becomes your personal life. You are not much good until it does. Its like being woven into a big web. You can't pull away, because all your little tendrils are woven into the picture.The following link is to an essay by Richard Maurer that describes the friendship between Willa Cather and the famous opera singer Olive Fremstad who greatly influenced the content of this book:http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/a..."}, {"userName": "Moonlight Reader", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5664767-moonlight-reader", "userReview": "Richly imagined, Cather\u2019s third novel is an exploration of the passion of the artist and the strength of youth. Her main character, Thea Kronborg, child of immigrants from Moonstone, Colorado, has all of the brazen energy and boundless potential of her prairie town. She is the exceptional child in a family of many children, the others quite ordinary, a girl so relentlessly herself that the triumphant arc of her life has a feeling of inevitability, in spite of the many obstacles that she must overcome with the force of her mind and character.The early part of the book concentrates on her time spent in Moonstone. Even as a child, many of her friends and acquaintances seem to recognize in Thea something to be nurtured. Dr. Archie, the unhappily married town doctor, introduces her to great writers, and spends time with her \u2013 in an entirely uncreepy way, thankfully \u2013 helping her intellectual development along. Her mother ensures that she has what music lessons are available, and private space in which to practice, which is a luxury in a home of at least five children. Thea herself possesses all of the engaging hubris of the child, confident in her future.Of this child, laying in her attic room, at home, Cather says:\nLife rushed in upon her from that window \u2013 or so it seemed. In reality, of course, life rushes from within not without. There is no work of art so big or so beautiful that it was not once contained within some youthful body, like this one which lay on the floor in the moonlight, pulsing with ardour and anticipation. [page 129]Thea is a character who bursts with possibility. I can\u2019t help but contrast Cather\u2019s writing with Edith Wharton, another woman who was writing very different books at nearly the same time, and compare Thea to Lily Bart. Where Lily is frozen and constricted, an expensive piece of carved marble, Thea is red-blooded and expansive, fully human. Where Wharton\u2019s characters are limited by complicated societal rules, Cather\u2019s characters, like her landscape, are boundless and free.When Thea is 15, her family, along with Dr. Archie, arrange for her to leave Moonstone to study music in Chicago, after she inherits a small life insurance policy from a friend. She finds herself on the train, headed east:\nShe smiled \u2014 although she was ashamed of it \u2014 with the natural contempt of strength for weakness, with the sense of physical security which makes the savage merciless. Nobody could die while he felt like that inside. The springs there were wound so tight that it would be a long while before there was any slack in them. The life in there was rooted deep. She was going to have a few things before she died. She realized that there were a great many trains dashing east and west on the face of the continent that night, and that they all carried yong people who meant to have things. But the difference was that she was going to get them! That was all. Let people try to stop her! She glowered at the rows of feckless bodies that lay sprawled in the chairs. Let them try it once! [page 200]\nThea bursts off the page, with her her self-confidence, her fearlessness, and her prodigious talent. Cather writes the western experience better than any other author I have ever encountered, with the possible exception of Wallace Stegner. Growing up under open skies has an impact on her characters, and she ensures that the reader understands this. You look at the world differently when you\u2019ve lived in a place where you can stand and mark the curve of the world untouched by signs of civilization.\nIt was over flat lands like this, stretching out to drink the sun, that the larks sang \u2014 and one\u2019s heart sang there, too. Thea was glad that this was her country, even if one did not learn to speak elegantly there. It was, somehow, an honest country, and there was a new song in that blue air which had never been sung in the world before. [page 202]\nHer time in Chicago moves her further along the path to musical success, and one of her teachers discovers that rather than piano, it is her voice that is truly remarkable. Ultimately, over the next several sections of the book, Thea leaves Chicago, studies in Germany, and returns to New York a fully-fledged opera singer. I am again reminded of Wharton \u2013 her Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Age of Innocence begins in an opera house, where Newland Archer is knuckling under to the societal pressure that he must marry, and he must marry a young woman who is, in many ways, the polar opposite of Thea Kronborg. When Cather speaks to Thea through Fred Ottenburg, Thea\u2019s married lover and greatest supporter, she might be speaking about May Welland:\nDon\u2019t you know that most of the people in the world are not individuals at all? They never have an individual idea or experience. A lot of girls go to boarding school together, come out the same season, dance at the same parties, are married off in groups, have their babies at about the same time, send their children to school together, and so the human crop renews itself. Such women know as much about the reality of the forms they go through as they know about the wars they learned the dates of. They get their most personal experiences out of novels and plays. Everything is second hand with them. Why, you couldn\u2019t live like that.\u201d [page 327]\nAmong Cather\u2019s longest books, The Song of the Lark moves quickly through Thea\u2019s development as an artist and represents a remarkable character study of a young woman who is unbowed by convention. As I continue with my Willa in Winter project, I plan to return to some of the themes that Cather is developing in this book, as my understanding deepens through further reading. I\u2019ll end this review with Thea\u2019s words:\nShe rose impatiently and walked to the edge of the cliff. \u201cIt\u2019s waking up every morning with the feeling that your life is your own, and your strength is your own, and your talent is your own; that you\u2019re all there, and there\u2019s no sag in you.\u201d [page 290].\nI can\u2019t help but feel that Willa Cather had no sag in her, either."}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "I can't say this is my favorite Cather novel; My Antonia and Death Comes for the Archbishop are much better. Thea Kronborg is not the easiest character to live with for 400 pages. Not only is she tough and determined, but often sullen and defeatist. Even the sensitive, understanding man who falls in love with her thinks of her sometimes as \"a little cold and empty, like a big room with no people in it.\" Nor is small-town, small-minded western America a place where I often like to hang out, literarily speaking. Thea's mother and the town doctor are among several who recognize Thea as different and push her to be bigger than the limits provincial Colorado places on nearly everyone, but her minister father is indifferent: \"She had seen it when she was at home last summer - the hostility of comfortable, self-satisfied people toward any serious effort. Even to her father it seemed indecorous. Whenever she spoke seriously, he looked apologetic.\"What I thought Cather did very well here was limn the artistic mind. Andor Harsanyi, Thea's piano teacher in Chicago, was particularly eloquent in his thoughts on music and what musical knowledge, musical giftedness, means. \"He did not often go to the opera, because the stupid things that singers did vexed him, and it always put him in a rage if the conductor held the beat or in any way accommodated the score to the singer.\" After a wonderful performance Thea gives at the Metropolitan Opera, an admirer asks Harsanyi what Thea's secret is. \"Her secret? It is every artist's secret\" - he waved his hand - \"passion. That is all. It is an open secret, and perfectly safe. Like heroism, it is inimitable in cheap materials.\"Then Cather's authorial voice says:Artistic growth is, more than it is anything else, a refining of the sense of truthfulness. The stupid believe that to be truthful is easy; only the artist, the great artist, knows how difficult it is. That afternoon nothing new came to Thea Kronborg, no enlightenment, no inspiration. She merely came into full possession of things she had been refining and perfecting for so long. Her inhibitions chanced to be fewer than usual, and, within herself, she entered into the inheritance that she herself had laid up, into the fullness of the faith she had kept before she knew its name or its meaning.Often when she sang, the best she had was unavailable; she could not break through to it, and every sort of distraction and mischance came between it and her. But this afternoon the closed roads opened, the gates dropped. What she had so often tried to reach, lay under her hand. She had only to touch an idea to make it live.While she was on the stage she was conscious that every movement was the right movement, that her body was absolutely the instrument of her idea. ...There's the loveliness (or maybe truth is a better word) Cather is capable of, in sentences like: \"There is no work of art so big or so beautiful that it was not once all contained in some youthful body, like this one which lay on the floor in the moonlight, pulsing with ardour and anticipation.\" The wonderful characterizations: \"On the whole, the Reverend Larsen was not an insincere man; he merely spent his life resting and playing, to make up for the time his forebears had wasted grubbing in the earth. He was simple-hearted and kind; he enjoyed his candy and his children and his sacred cantatas. He could work energetically at almost any form of play.\"Perhaps this the only novel where someone dies in an explosion after trying to clean their upholstery with gasoline. Given that so much of it is autobiographical, you wonder if Cather knew a person this happened to...There are three references to nigger (as there occasionally are in older books). Two are to the \"niggerhead cactus\", more politely known as Echinocactus polycephalus, common to the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts. And after Thea has achieved a big operatic career, she's staying in a hotel and her laundry goes missing.

The world is little, people are little, human life is little. There is only one big thing - desire. And before it, when it is big, all is little.\" \u2013 Willa Cather\u201cThe Song of the Lark\u201d by Willa Cather is a novel after my own heart. When I stumbled on Dolors' beautifully crafted review of this book by an author I have never read, I felt that knowing tug that signaled pleasure and promise. I was right but I had not expected to feel a familiar connection with the main protagonist, Thea Kronborg, many times over.Thea Kronborg, known as \u201cLittle Swede\u201d, was the daughter of a humble preacher who had seven children. Thea had an extraordinary gift of music. Living in the obscure (fictional) town of Moonstone, Colorado, and given her family\u2019s limited financial resources, Thea did not have early access to fine musical training. She took piano lessons from Professor Wunsch, a wandering musician who drank. Wunsch recognised Thea's talent - her \"power of application, her rugged will\". It was Wunsch who first introduced Thea to classical songs and a tiny window opened that fired in Thea a love of singing. It brought back reminders of songs I\u2019d learnt (e.g., \u201cEurydice\u201d in Gluck\u2019s Orpheus) and sent me looking up songs such as \u201cCome Ye, Disconsolate\u201d that Thea sang at her father\u2019s church services. \u201cThe Song of the Lark\u201d traced Thea\u2019s arduous journey to become a professional singer. The roadblocks to realizing a dream seemed insurmountable because a gift, like a plant, cannot flourish except in the right soil. Even though Thea was intelligent and talented, her restricted opportunities for early training meant she was uncultivated and ignorant. Her first concert pianist teacher in Chicago (Andor Harsanyi) observed that Thea came to him \u201clike a fine young savage, a book with nothing written in it.\" What were her chances of succeeding? I was swept up in Thea\u2019s quest to become the best she can be as a musician. I was impressed by Thea\u2019s tenacity, fighting spirit, discipline, and industry. Her strengths were her \"unusual power of work\", \"her way of charging at difficulties as if they were foes she had long been seeking,.. as if they were destined for her and she for them.\" I enjoyed reading about her music lessons and reflected on how the student\u2019s relationship with his/her mentor was all important in shaping both the gift and the professional attitude. It was Harsanyi who said, \"When people, serious people, believe in you, they give you some of their best, so - take care of it, Miss Kronborg.\" With Madison Bowers, the best voice teacher in Chicago, who lacked warmth and generosity, Thea took on the grouchiness, skepticism, and contempt that Bowers modelled. I envied Thea her band of ardent supporters: her aunt Tillie, and the men - Ray Kennedy, Dr. Archie, Fred Ottenburg - who were all half smitten or head over heels in love with her. These, together with her teachers such as Wunsch, Harsanyi and Bowers, recognised and stretched her musical knowledge and skills. A few provided financial support that enabled her to hone her gift. Much as I admired her many fine qualities, Thea became less and less likeable as she matured. I felt elated when Thea was finally given the opportunity to sing the lead roles at the Metropolitan Opera House because the feted professionals were unavailable due to illness. Then I felt her panic when she had to rehearse in double quick time and hoped she would nail the role(s)so well she could secure future contracts and gain the recognition she deserved. Of course, there was overwhelming joy when she finally delivered a song that allowed her to shine or a performance where everything came together and bore distinctly her signature brilliance. Music aside, Cather wrote beautifully about the natural landscape. At Panther Canyon, Arizona, restoration of spirit could be found among the \"yellow rocks baking in sunlight\" and the cleansing solitude. The language in this novel (published in 1915) belonged to an earlier era and was genteelly elegant. Cather also painted character sketches that were vivid even for minor ones that were met in passing such as the Rev Larsen in Chicago.This is a novel that will definitely resonate with music lovers and particularly individuals who have studied voice and understood from direct experience the challenges of singing to an audience. It may be slightly alienating for others who have little or no interest in music making. But I like to believe that there\u2019s something in this book for everyone. Because like Thea Kronborg, many of us have dreams and understand the struggles toward actualization that are common to all and yet unique to our own experience."}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614752-heidi", "userReview": "Willa Cather is wonderful at evoking the feeling of the Plains.

It has taken me forever to read, as I picked up and read several other books while I was reading this novel. Thea Kronburg is born in the small town of Moonstone, Colorado and the novel follows her early life a pianist going onto develop into an opera singer. She is a very strong character, able to have a career without a husband, but she loses her family of origin as Moonstone is not a place where her talent can develop or be discovered. I found the first part of the novel tedious, as her youth was presented in rich, if not tedious details. The pace picked up after she has left for Chicago the first time and then returned to Chicago to work on her voice. Likewise, at the end, when her friends meet up with her in New York City after she has been in Dresden, I felt it got bogged down in details. It was written in 1915, so the style and language was different from contemporary fiction, but I felt that some of Cather's other books were more streamlined. I have read My Antonia, so onto one of Ours!"}, {"userName": "ShaLisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128348-shalisa", "userReview": "This is a hard book to review. I felt like there were two parts - the first half and the second half and that each part suggested different ideas and themes. The first half, which I liked so much more, was about a curious and intelligent girl growing up honest and interested. She had flare and she seemed to care a great deal about people, the real person and not their circumstance. She was talented, yes, very much so, but she worked hard practicing four hours a day and she cared about her influence and impact on the small part of the world she knew. Ray's story touched me and I wonder at Thea's happiness had she remained in Moonstone with those people who were genuine and cared about her. The author suggest Thea could not be happy had she not developed her talents as she eventually did but it was the memories of her youth that kept her sane. I suppose you don't appreciate what you have until you've lived something else. Thea had to become great in order to love and appreciate what made her so.The second part of the book held Thea in a much different light and one much less becoming. She was hard, self-contained, proud and conciented, admittedly so, and she viewed her friends as followers, almost. Although she loved Dr. Archie (and wasn't he a great and noble character?)she didn't treat him equaly but almost as if he owed her something for her having so much talent. Fred was like her in many ways and their love entanglements seemed to deserve each other. She kept her passion and flare but she could not appreciate other people who were not great artists and apparently there were none others like her. She was never satisfied. She never knew if she was in love. She never developed lasting friendships outside of Moonstone and Fred. Her passion rested on her voice alone. The back of the book says of this young heroine, \"I want only the impossibly things. The others don't interest me.\" And that is exactly how she lived and because of it she became great but not happy. This book suggests that great artists are born not made. Or rather born, and then made. Can one become great on hard work and inginuity alone? Also, Cather continually referred to the non artists or poor artists as \"stupid people\" and this being her most autobiographical novel make me wonder what kind of person Cather was. Was she so proud and dislikable as Thea became? I wonder at her life story and her own sacrifices.I loved the character of Thea's mother and I cannot imagine any amount of fame or fortune being great enough to keep one away from her dying mother. So sad. I appreciated the closing pages as Thea describes the scene of a poor German couple watching and appreciating a grand opera together all the while being so much in love and seeming so happy. The epilogue told that Thea, one day, did indeed have a husband. Are we to assume it was Fred? I daren't say but it does suggest that Thea changed her mind on what she wanted out of life. Fred said he wanted a son. He said he regretted spending all those years on Thea. Both these characters who demonstrated fame and glory in two very different ways, took the long road to finding what it was that they really wanted. Ironically, Dr. Archie's story is opposite. He became free on the death of his wife and the rise of his fortune. Willa Cather's writing is beautiful. I love her venacular. I love the idea that art can cause one to feel the exhilaration of getting free from personalities, of being released from one's own past. I appreciate the title and where it emerged from - the painting - allowing Thea to relish in the abilities on another kind of artist. The book suggests you cannot be a great artist without great sacrifices and I, for one, am grateful for such great artists."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202005-melanie", "userReview": "Why did I select this book? I'd never read Cather, and I knew that the plot included opera. Well, now I have, and it does.The plot - the trajectory of a young girl's life from small-town Colorado to international acclaim as a Wagnerian diva - is almost incidental. The huge Colorado landscape will, one knows, transmute itself into the vistas of Valhalla. The landscape itself will be as much a character as any human being, and will be given a voice more eloquent and true than any human.In fact, every character's inner life centers on the radiant promise and fulfillment of Thea Kronenborg's artistry. Even the dying thoughts of a hideously-injured trainman are reverences to Thea. Thea contains multitudes, and they all are consumed by Thea.They all worship with the same voice, designed to express grand principles, both aesthetic and philosophic. Unless I kept track of the the \"he said\" antecedents, I had no idea who was thinking, talking, or observing.Perhaps I truly began to lose heart when Theas' musical mentors steered her toward Wagner. I loathe Wagner and nearly everything his music has influenced. Certainly, I always lose interest when a novel seems to be nothing but a duck blind for the author's philosophy. I would have stopped reading well before the end, since I did not care a whit about any character except Thea's mother, but I soldiered on in the name of - oh, who cares....I'm not sorry that I read this book, but I am glad that it's over.Notable passages (quotation herein does not constitute approbation by Teabird):\"Though their challenge is universal and eternal, the stars get no answer but that - the brief light flashed back to them from the eyes of the young who unaccountable aspire.\"\"Artistic growth is, more than it is anything else, a refining of the sense of truthfulness. The stupid believe that to be truthful is easy; only the artist, the great artist, knows how difficult it is.\"\"He was observant, truthful, and kindly - perhaps the chief requisite in a agood story-teller.\"\"[A rabbit:] seemed to be lapping up the moonlight like cream.\"\"[Thea's sister had:] the kind of fishy curiosity which justifies itself by an expression of horror.\""}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "Willa Cather published this novel in 1915. The story begins in Moonstone, Colorado, a tiny town in the sand country. The heroine is Thea Kronborg, the daughter of a Methodist pastor. Thea is musical and first studies the piano with a local failed musician. Eventually her talents are recognized, and, shedding the expectations and aspirations of her family and acquaintances, she travels to Chicago for further study, encouraged mostly by the local doctor, Dr. Archie, her lifelong friend and supporter. First she continues her study of piano, but her teacher recognizes that her true talent is voice, and she transitions to a voice teacher. Her challenges and struggles are described. Eventually she develops a relationship with a rich but sensitive young man, Fred Ottenburg, who encourages her and becomes a lifelong friend, their marriage being impossible because of his existing marriage to a handicapped wife. In order to develop her talent, Thea travels to Europe and lives there while studying for nearly a decade, finally returning to New York and triumphing in Wagnerian roles at the Met.Cather is able subtly and evocatively to describe not only physical landscapes and settings but also to convincingly portray the psychological nuances of a growing and talented young woman often out of touch with the provincial community around her. The challenges and struggles of artistic development and the demands on the artist are explored in detail, very convincingly. But Cather is also able to show how who we are and who we become is always tied in imperishable ways to who we once were and to those who are a part of our pasts. In Thea\u2019s case, her family and the friends who have loved, encouraged, and supported her through the years can never entirely be left behind and are ever part of who she is.I found this novel to be touching, a poignant portrayal of a character not always likable but always understandable, vulnerable, and fiercely loyal to her friends and her art. Thea is real in this novel, not simply a symbol or a type.

From the wonderful landscapes she so intimately describes -- places I had never heard of, Panther Canyon which in real life is Walnut Canyon in Arizona, the sand hills of eastern Colorado -- to the small town railroad culture of late 1800's Colorado, to the dear players in Thea Kronberg's life, to her inner life so deeply fulfilled by these influences -- this is a story of the development of an artist from childhood. It also feels like a series of paintings and meditations, and like a lesson in opera (which was way above my head). Then there is Thea, a child with a difference who captures the hearts and devotions of many in her community and goes on to a life of hardship and striving while becoming a great singer. Whether or not this truly is Willa Cather's most autobiographical book, it is clear that Cather was herself a remarkable person. She could not have endowed this book with such richness were she not.
