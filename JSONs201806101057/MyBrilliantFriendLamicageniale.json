In fact, everyone in the office received a copy \u2013 that\u2019s how much our boss wanted us to read it. Before you start wondering what sort of wonderful place I worked at, let me clarify it was a literary agency, so such things were totally commonplace. So despite the terrible cover, and a rather idiotic blurb I knew it would be a fine book.No review of Ferrante\u2019s book is complete without a mention of how no one knows who Ferrante is or even if she exists as an individual woman at all. Personally, I find this whole mystery of little interest as I share her view that all that the author wants to say she should say in the book and there is no need for the entire marketing circus.Ferrante\u2019s Naples novels have been compared to Knausgaard\u2019s magnum opus because both authors can be characterised by their hyperreal scrutiny which seemingly can only be achieved in autobiographical novels. The autobiographical component is official in case of Knausgaard and alleged in Ferrante\u2019s. Additionally, Knausgaard has happily joined the marketing circus, which is why I find Ferrante\u2019s presumed exhibitionism a lot more palatable. These books defiantly ignore all creative writing advice and cheerfully tell and not show, abandon all sensible plot structure and introduce as many characters as they feel like, not really caring whether that whole cast is in any way necessary. Neither do they have time for stylistic flourishes. Ferrante\u2019s prose is bare; the language takes a back seat and is nothing more than a tool to the narrative that is pushed forward by its own urgency. What we are left with, though, is so vivid and authentic that no carefully polished novel could compete with it. This is great news. Rejoice, people, because in the age when it is possible to get a DEGREE in novel writing (without having to write anything of significance), comes a book which just doesn\u2019t give a shit and still manages to steal the hearts of thousands. I don\u2019t suppose I have to explain what this book is about, because you have other reviews for that. But in short it\u2019s about the intense friendship and rivalry between two girls growing up in the impoverished outskirts of Naples. You might argue it\u2019s a book about female experience, and to an extent it certainly is, but judging by how much men love this book, I\u2019d say it\u2019s rather universal. But then, I generally feel female experience, once stripped of all telling signs could be pretty universal, because, you know, women are people too. Anyway, to me this book was more about class than gender. That constant anger, violence, the \u2018let\u2019s get them before they get us\u2019 feel permeates the novel. And the moral, if \u2018My Brilliant Friend\u2019 has a moral at all, is that you can take a girl out of the Naples slums, but you can\u2019t take the Naples slums out of the girl. Make no mistake, though. This is by no means an emotionally manipulative misery memoir. This is a story of childhood that simply doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s underprivileged."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16052073-rebecca", "userReview": "I tried. I tried. I tried. For 200 pages I tried to see what it is about this writer that gets such acclaim, but with 130 pages to go, I abandoned it - there are just too many other books in my waiting pile that I want to read. This book was chosen for book club which is why I persisted so long (I normally stop reading a book pretty quickly if it doesn't engage me). I didn't develop any concern for the characters, and found it really repetitive - different stage school/same response from parents/same competitiveness with Lila/ it just went on and on and didn't seem to GO anywhere. It was supposed to be the story of a friendship from childhood until womanhood, set in Naples in the 1950's - but I then discovered this book only goes up until the two girls are 16 - there is a sequel - and at that point I decided OH ENOUGH! I realised I was not even going to get some sort of satisfaction from finishing it. Endless minor characters proved annoying and I gave up trying to keep up with who they were (despite the list in the front of the book) as well as all the interludes with various boys."}, {"userName": "Rick Riordan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25375513-rick-riordan", "userReview": "I have been studying Italian in my free time and so decided to try reading one of the most popular Italian writers of today: Elena Ferrante. There have been many articles about this author's mysterious anonymity. Her real identity is unknown except to her publisher because she wishes to have a normal life. I get that. Still, it only adds to the intrigue, as you can't help but wonder who writes these marvelous books. My Brilliant Friend is not the sort of book I would normally pick up as I prefer fantasy fiction. This is contemporary realistic fiction about two women who grow up together in the 1950s and 1960s in a poor neighborhood in Naples. The cast of characters is large, and for me, an American reader, I was missing some cultural context that made it a little bewildering at first. I read the book in English (because my Italian is not that good yet) and the style was both deeply intimate and jarringly matter-of-fact. The narrator Elena tells us everything about her upbringing in a neighborhood where harsh poverty is the norm and family violence is unremarkable, even, for instance, when a father sends a daughter flying out a second story window. Elena grows up side by side with her friend/foil/personal albatross Lila, who is naturally brilliant at everything and more beautiful than Elena, but who is held down by circumstances to work in her father's shoe store while Elena has a chance to escape her life through education. The book is a blow-by-blow confessional, following the two girls from their earliest memories through their early adulthood. The short chapters keep the pages turning, and by the end of the novel I found myself very involved in the lives of the characters. It is epic in the best sense of the word, and yet quiet and personal in its scope. At the end, there is a cliffhanger so brutal I immediately had to go and buy the next volume of this series. Wow, cliffhangers work! I should try them some time . . ."}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "type, edit, delete, undo delete, type, edit, delete..deep breathstart againtype, edit, delete\u2026make a coffeetype, edit, delete\u2026pour a drinktype, edit, delete..desperation sets in\nThe dog ate my review!\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026................................Why, why, why can\u2019t I find any words to say about this book?The problem is I don\u2019t know what I feel about it.

My Brilliant New ObsessionBelieve all the hype. This is a rich, immersive, deeply satisfying book that, like many great novels, captures a particular time and place with complete authority. I can\u2019t wait to read the other books in the series. In a dirt poor neighbourhood on the outskirts of Naples in the 1950s, bright working class girls Elena Greco (our narrator) and bestie Lila Cerrullo survive childhood and adolescence, learning how to navigate school, boys, sex and the limited opportunities available to them because of their class and gender.Initially I found the book disorienting. The prologue is set decades later and involves people we don\u2019t yet know. Lila has disappeared and Elena is trying to discover what happened to her. Presumably these books are her way of finding that out.And once the story proper begins, it takes a while to keep all the names straight. Who is Nino, again? Enzo? What are the grocers called? (It doesn\u2019t help that only Elena calls her friend Lila; everyone else calls her Lina, and her birth name is Rafaella! Also: Elena is often called Lenu.) An index of the family names at the beginning proves very helpful. But Elena Ferrante\u2019s prose is ravishing. It\u2019s graceful without being precious, mature and knowing while still immediate and visceral. She literally plunges you into the lives of these children. Family vendettas take on the power of myth; middle school is a fraught war zone where learning goes beyond what\u2019s in the books; each change in the girls' bodies is registered and assessed in terms of their newfound power (or lack of it). Late childhood and early adolescence can be a painful time; the stakes are high; your identity isn\u2019t yet formed. There\u2019s a sense of danger lurking everywhere. One month that boy in class could be a friendly ally; a few months later he might spit at your feet, ignore you and take up your best friend. Every situation, not just a class assignment, is a problem to be solved.Near the end of the book, the way one character orchestrates her way out of one engagement and into another is worthy of something from The Godfather movies. In its insights, rich texture and violence \u2013 murder, threats, being thrown out of a window \u2013 the book reminded me of Alice Munro\u2019s early masterpiece  Lives Of Girls And Women. And several things will continue to haunt me: \u2022 The girls\u2019 first trip outside their neighbourhood \u2013 when they \u201crun away\u201d\u2022 How the title is mentioned in the final section of the book (this makes you wonder who, exactly, is the \u201cbrilliant\u201d one)\u2022 A scene in which the neighbourhood\u2019s teens, all dressed up, cross into a fancier part of town and realize, with insecurity and anger, how limited their world and lives are\u2022 The climactic wedding scene, in which all the threads of the story come together \u2013 sex, romance, class, destiny \u2013 up until the surprising twist in the final line, which will make you reconsider a big chunk of the story\u2022 Elena\u2019s introduction to the pleasures (and dangers) of sexuality\u2022 The idea of how we sometimes act to impress friends, mimic being courageous by thinking of others' actions, or more subtly, do things while imagining our friends doing them\u2022 The longings, fears and sheer awkwardness of adolescence\u2022 The legacy of fascism, complete with stories about what family did what to whom, and the changing nature of Italian society\u2022 The idea of how education gets you ahead but also alienates you from the class you might soon be leaving behindFerrante (a pen name) has structured the book so carefully that an early sequence in which the girls try to retrieve their dolls in a sewer contains, in miniature, everything that the book will eventually deal with: lost innocence, petty jealousy, money, imagination, sinister men, courage, and the way that one person\u2019s account of the facts can vary drastically with the so-called truth.Now that I've come down with \"Ferrante fever,\" I look forward to the next novel,  The Story Of A New Name."}, {"userName": "Lucie Cavaroc", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3693305-lucie-cavaroc", "userReview": "The entire time I spent reading this book I asked myself \"What is wrong with this book?

Many of the sentences were confusing and even contradictory. The redeeming factor, and the reason I gave it two stars instead of one, was that the Italian atmosphere was strongly prevalent and somewhat enjoyable - I learned what living in Naples in the 50s must have been like."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "This novel has so much violence that it should come with some kind of rating. Seriously, I had no idea it was so dangerous to grow up in Naples.\"I feel no nostalgia for our childhood: it was full of violence.\"My Brilliant Friend is the story of two childhood friends, Elena and Lila. It is the first in a series, and I confess that when I started reading it, I did not intend to continue with them \u2014 I was just going to read this first one to see what all the fuss over Ferrante was about. It took me a while to get into the book; there are so many families in the neighborhood, and everyone has nicknames that it was tough to remember who was who and who did what to which relative. (There is a cast of characters listed at the front of the book, but it's still confusing.) About midway through the book, I really connected with the two main characters, especially after they started going to school. I could relate to Elena's jealousy about Lila, and how she admired and imitated her strength. Occasionally Lila opens up and admits how important Elena is to her, and those moments are lovely. Ferrante's descriptions are so good that eventually it felt as if I had been living with these families.But what exactly is the story, you ask? Well, there are lots of them. There are stories about cruel boys in the neighborhood. There are stories about Lila's dream of making it rich by designing special shoes to sell. There are stories about the competitions at school, and how Elena and Lila would push each other to learn more. There are stories of Lila's family, and how her father would abuse her when he lost his temper. There are stories about the men who pursued Lila when she became a beautiful teenager, and how she risked offending a powerful family. There is the story of Elena's first boyfriend, and how she has to navigate high school. And finally, there is the story of a wedding.The wedding scene is what closes out this first novel, and something happens there that convinced me to read the second book. You win, Ferrante.Update: A Few Weeks LaterI have gotten so involved in this series that I am reading Book 3 and have already ordered Book 4. My advice to those starting out is to be patient with this first novel -- a lot of the events that happen in Elena's childhood have long-lasting effects, like seeds that had to be planted so they could sprout later on. The more I read about these two women, the more I admire them. I highly recommend these Ferrante novels. Favorite Quote\"Right away, from the first day, school had seemed to me a much nicer place than home. It was the place in the neighborhood where I felt safest, I went there with excitement. I paid attention to the lessons, I carried out with the greatest diligence everything that I was told to carry out, I learned. But most of all I liked pleasing the teacher, I liked pleasing everyone.\"A Disturbing But Incredible Passage\"We lived in a world in which children and adults were often wounded, blood flowed from the wounds, they festered, and sometimes people died. One of the daughters of Signora Assunta, the fruit and vegetable seller, had stepped on a nail and died of tetanus. Signora Spagnuole's youngest child had died of croup. A cousin of mine, at the age of twenty, had gone one morning to move some rubble and that night was dead, crushed, the blood pouring out of his ears and mouth. My mother's father had been killed when he fell from a scaffolding at a building site. The father of Signor Peluso was missing an arm, the lathe had caught him unawares. The sister of Giuseppina, Signor Peluso's wife, had died of tuberculosis at twenty-two. The oldest son of Don Achille \u2014 I had never seen him, and yet I seemed to remember him \u2014 had gone to war and died twice: drowned in the Pacific Ocean, then eaten by sharks. The entire Melchiorre family had died clinging to each other, screaming with fear, in a bombardment. Old Signorina Clorinda had died inhaling gas instead of air. Guanine, who was in fourth grade when were were in first, had died one day because he had come across a bomb and touched it. Legion, with whom we had played in the courtyard, or maybe not, she was only a name, had died of typhus. Our world was like that, full of words that killed: croup, tetanus, typhus, gas, war, lathe, rubble, work, bombardment, bomb, tuberculosis, infection. With these words and those years I bring back the many fears that accompanied me all my life.\""}, {"userName": "Jaidee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295672-jaidee", "userReview": "1 \"sweet Jesus...this is the first of four books\" stars !!First of all a bit of translationIn English we say blahblahblah.

The minutiae of Elena and Lila's lives into which Ferrante dives takes on these mythic proportions, pulling the reader along on a tense and frightful story. But at first glance, the story is anything but tense and frightful. It's a story of female friendship, between two lower-class girls in Naples following WWII. Ferrante, with precision and passion, recounts the lives of these girls as anything less than ideal. There's an underlying push and pull to their friendship that goes against the expected narrative of girlhood. It's compelling and constantly teetering on the edge of disaster, again bringing back this theme of myth and how each detail lends itself to something greater, something disastrous. We learn as the characters learn. Ferrante excels at establishing a tone fit to the story. When Elena, our narrator, is unsure, we are unsure. When she's jealous, we're jealous. She's spiteful at times, and compassionate at others. It all builds upon itself to create a vivid atmosphere that is only enhanced by the gritty Neapolitan setting. I wasn't convinced by the first half of the book. But the second part really sold me. And I think that if I were to go back now and re-read the beginning, I'd be much more comfortable with the characters, the setting and the narrative structure. It's disconcerting and disorienting at first, getting thrown into a world with so many characters and so little hand-holding. But I appreciate Ferrante's confidence in the reader. She gives you more than you might handle, but once you get a grip on it, it's incredibly satisfying. I'm intrigued to see where the story goes, so much so that I ordered the next book in the series immediately after finishing this one. I only expect the books to get better and better; and based on what Ferrante's proved with this one, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.First read: January 14-23, 2016Second read: December 23-26, 2016"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "[ like throwing your eleven year old daughter out a window into the street.

Foto usata per il flano dell'adattamento teatrale in lingua inglese della tetralogia ferrantiana.Ho l\u2019impressione che Elena Ferrante ami spiazzare il lettore, e da lettore, trovo che essere spiazzato sia una bella sensazione. All\u2019inizio di questo romanzo c\u2019\u00e8 un ricco elenco di famiglie e nomi e relazioni: ma non serve, non \u00e8 necessario, si segue agevolmente il racconto anche senza consultarlo. Nell\u2019elenco sono compresi molti personaggi femminili e maschili: ma gli uomini (maschi?) fanno la solita misera figura che fanno nelle opere di questa misteriosa scrittrice \u2013 e tutti, incluse le tante donne, sono solo contorno, perch\u00e9 la narrazione ha ben al centro, senza deviazioni, due bambine che vediamo diventare adolescenti e giovani donne, Lila ed Elena detta Lenuccia o Len\u00f9. Questa \u00e8 la loro storia, quella della loro amicizia e della loro vita. Si parte dall\u2019oggi, tra Torino e Napoli, con l\u2019io narrante gi\u00e0 sessantenne. Ma si dimentica presto il prologo, e Torino scompare, l\u2019azione rimane a Napoli, in un rione di periferia e di povert\u00e0, si piomba e ci si immerge negli anni Cinquanta. E come dicevo, presto il prologo sparisce dalla nostra attenzione, e ci si concentra su cosa succede, e molto si aspetta cosa succeder\u00e0. Si ha voglia di conoscere qualcosa che in fondo sappiamo gi\u00e0.Tra Lila ed Elena, io lettore avrei definito \u2018amica geniale\u2019 la prima: invece, \u00e8 proprio Lila a usare questa espressione per Elena, l\u2019io narrante. \u00c8 la storia della loro amicizia, dicevo: un\u2019amicizia che all\u2019inizio sembra difficile, le due si tengono distanti, quasi separate \u2013 ma si guardano, si studiano, come se si prendessero le misure. E proprio quella pi\u00f9 tosta, Lila, spesso definita cattiva, descritta aspra forte determinata fino alla violenza, proprio lei sar\u00e0 la prima a tendere la mano. Anche questo momento \u00e8 spiazzante, arriva non previsto. Bello.Catherine McCormack (Lila) e Niamh Cusack (Len\u00f9) protagoniste dell'adattamento teatrale di L'Amica Geniale in lingua inglese, scritto da April DeAngelis e diretto da Melly Still in scena al Rose Theatre di Kingston, Londra.In una storia cos\u00ec calata nella Napoli povera del dopoguerra, aspettarsi dialoghi in dialetto \u00e8 scontato. Invece, Ferrante evita, accenna appena, e rimane agganciata alla lingua comune. Come Lila, Elena Ferrante parla attraverso la scrittura: \u2026non lasciava traccia di innaturalezza, non si sentiva l\u2019artificio della parola scritta. Leggevo e intanto vedevo, sentivo lei. Si respira cinema, le immagini sono incise, nitide, anche piacevolmente stereotipate: proiettare Sofia Loren o una Magnani scesa all\u2019ombra del Vesuvio \u00e8 automatico. Il cast dell'adattamento teatrale \u00e8 composto da 12 attori: tranne le due protagoniste, le due amiche geniali, gli altri interpretano tutti pi\u00f9 di un ruolo, con entrate e uscite e cambi d'abito a ritmo continuo. Al centro, la famiglia Solara.Per\u00f2, \u00e8 questione di poco, e Ferrante cambia prospettiva, perennemente affascinata da cosa c\u2019\u00e8 dietro e sotto, dal lato oscuro, come la figlia del suo penultimo romanzo, la parte cattiva, il lato indegno, perfino meschino. Come tra Lila e Len\u00f9 la grande amicizia \u00e8 basata su un gioco continuo di scambio e rovesciamento, Ferrante sorprende e confonde senza nascondere, racconta personaggi che nessuna forma pu\u00f2 contenere, che prima o poi possono spaccare tutto un\u2019altra volta, come succede alla pentola di rame - con un'ansia particolare, quasi urgenza di tirare fuori, spiegare, che regala a queste pagine una piacevolezza di lettura inaspettata.Chiara Lagani (qui con Fiorenza Menni) della Compagnia Fanny & Alexander ha realizzato uno spettacolo intitolato \u201cDa parte loro nessuna domanda imbarazzante\u201d ispirato a una scena di questo romanzo, le due piccole amiche e le bambole che si perdono nella cantina.Non ho nostalgia della nostra infanzia, \u00e8 piena di violenza.

La vita era cos\u00ec e basta, crescevamo con l\u2019obbligo di renderla difficile agli altri prima che gli altri la rendessero difficile a noi. Certo, a me sarebbero piaciuti i modi gentili che predicavano la maestra e il parroco, ma sentivo che quei modi non erano adatti al nostro rione, anche se eri femmina.

From early childhood till our twenties we were inseparable like two budgerigars. We were alike, yet different. We were alike because of youth but we differed about our expectations. While I daydreamed she had her feet firmly fixed on the ground. She was good at science while I always preferred humanities. She was pretty, easy-mannered girl, no wonder she was popular with the boys. But it was never any problem to me because I had every boy I wanted. I had David Copperfield and Athos, Meaulnes and Mr Darcy, Hamlet and Snufkin. Sounds stupid, I know. Anyway, being shy and introvert by nature I was impressed by her go-getting energy, I admired her aptitude for learning. We attended to the same primary school, then secondary to finally get together into university. I remember our conversations, dreams, confessions. Though time ruthlessly verified some of our youthful desires and unworldly ideas I still consider these years being extraordinary time in my life. Why do I write this ? Because of Elena Ferrante. Her name seems to be all the rage amongst my friends lately. Completely deservedly, I think.  My brilliant friend  is a first volume of series and centers around two young girls, Lila and Elena, and their not always easy friendship. One day Lila, now in her sixties, disappears without a trace. With all her things, books, clothes, photos. Nothing\u2019s left as if Lila wanted to vanish off the face of the earth. This an unaccountable behaviour serves for pretext for Elena to tell us their story.So, let's move then over forty years back to the peripheral parts of Naples, to the fifties of the last century. Girls grow up here surrounded by poverty and violence, falsely understood pride and macho behaviors of their fathers and brothers. They make plans for the future how to earn enough money to break out of embrace of misery, ignorance and oppression. Their relation is uncanny medley of admiration, envy and rivalry. Girls are like fire and water. Elena is polite, dutiful and well-behaved meanwhile Lila is impulsive and rebellious. Although they are friends through thick and thin they do not cease to compete with each other. It is pull and push relationship, marked with the ups and downs, full of resentments and mutual fascination.  My brilliant friend  is a record of friendship and adolescence but also meticulous description of the world which is about to change.Maybe this novel is not especially innovative but Ferrante has a keen eye. Maybe the name of the narrator is not quite accidental. Maybe Ferrante just writes about herself and performs a personal exorcisms. Anyway, her observations are acutely accurate and, needless to say, I\u2019m eagerly waiting to know subsequent choices, joys and failures of Lila and Elena."}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "\u201cI am made and remade continually. Different people draw different words from me.\u201d So said Virginia Woolf and this, the forging of identity in relationship, is very much the theme of Elena Ferrante\u2019s compelling novel. Elena, the narrator of the novel, is in first grade when we first meet her. She lives in a violent and impoverished working class district of Naples where kindred spirits or role models are hard to find. Certainly not her mother \u2013 \u201cMy mother did her best to make me understand that I was superfluous in her life. I wasn\u2019t agreeable to her nor was she to me. I found her body repulsive.\u201d Then she meets Lila. Lila is a wild child with exalted sensibility and intelligence for her age. In Lila Elena finally identifies an ideal she can aspire to. The portrait of Elena and Lila\u2019s bond is the novel\u2019s masterstroke. As all around them the somewhat coarse uneducated boys of the neighbourhood seek to distort and shape the girls to suit their own masculine vanity \u2013 \u201cdissolve the margins\u201d of separation - the two girls forge an independence of spirit that is nurtured by the inspiration they find in each other. They create a compelling and exciting inner world together, a stage on which they both are able to dramatise themselves as the heroines of their own fate. The novel is the story of their friendship and Elena\u2019s attempts to transcend her background of thrift and mean spirited bullying. It\u2019s an unusual and highly distinctive novel (visually reminiscent of de Sica\u2019s early brilliant films). Essentially because of the intensity and lucidity of Ferrante\u2019s prose. She manages to write about the most prosaic detail with a kind of hallucinatory urgency and as such her voice hits exactly the right notes in expressing the joys and torments of adolescence when every day seems to hold moments of both pivotal humiliation and triumph, moments few adults are capable of perceiving. Thus the narrative is a constant high tension wire where the mundane relentlessly spills over into epiphany or violence. There\u2019s a passage when Elena is writing about Lila\u2019s prose style which would serve as the perfect eulogy of Ferrante\u2019s prose style \u2013 \u201cShe expressed herself in sentences that were well constructed, and without error, even though she had stopped going to school, but \u2013 further \u2013 she left no trace of effort, you weren\u2019t aware of the artifice of the written word. I read and I saw her, heard her. The voice set in the writing overwhelmed me, enthralled me even more than when we talked face to face; it was completely cleansed of the dross of speech, the confusion of the oral.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "My Brilliant Friend, the first in Elena Ferrante\u2019s quartet about best friends from a Naples ghetto, is a novel about power: who holds it, how it is won and lost, and what happens when power shifts occur. It is a story of violence: domestic and cultural, physical and emotional. All this, in a novel about two young girls exploring friendship and adolescence in post-war southern Italy. Elena Greco and Lila Cerrullo are daughters of working class families, growing up in a crowded, poor, electrifying neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples in the mid-1950s. Elena recounts their adolescence from the remove of middle age, stating: I feel no nostalgia for our childhood: it was full of violence. ... Life was like that, that's all, we grew up with the duty to make it difficult for others before they made it difficult for us.Parents beat their children, brothers beat their sisters, husbands beat their wives, and the wealthy Solara brothers keep iron rods in the boot of their sports car, so handy for street fights. But Elena and Lila are part of a blossoming generation, one that\u2014like the city of Naples itself\u2014is rising out of the traditions of violence and oppression that go hand in hand with poverty into something brighter. Or so it appears at the beginning. By the end of this first installment of Ferrante\u2019s epic Neapolitan series, it seems Fate lifts up one of these young women while holding the other hostage to her culture. Lila is a force that defies definition. A scrawny child, she is like an orphan in a Victorian melodrama: all skin and bones, street smarts and fearlessness. The neighborhood and its residents\u2014from her family, her schoolmates and teachers to the boys who are enchanted by the flare of her intelligence and her eventual swan-like beauty\u2014are blank slates upon which Lila mercilessly etches her vision, her truth. And yet, such promise in a young girl with a sparkling intellect is thwarted by her own ambition. Money is what Lila seeks to yank her from the doom of the women around her: marriage and children before they are twenty, followed by decades of drudgery, their beauty a brief flame snuffed out by duty, submission, ignorance. Lila\u2019s childhood dream of becoming a famous novelist is replaced by the more practical plans of starting a luxury shoe business with her troubled older brother, Rino. But even that scheme is pounded out of possibility by their cobbler father, until one of Lila\u2019s suitors steps in with salvation. Ironically, it is Lila\u2019s beauty that offers her the kind of power she can\u2019t reach even with her preternatural intelligence. ...something had begun to emanate from Lila's mobile body that males sensed, an energy that dazed them, like the swelling sound of beauty arriving. The music had to stop before they returned to themselves, with uncertain smiles and extravagant applause.The tension of female friendship has rarely been so sharply and tenderly displayed in literature. Elena is objective neither with herself nor with Lila, and the push-pull of loathing and love is keenly felt. From the moment Lila drops Elena\u2019s beloved doll into a hole, your sympathies are torn between these two girls, one so cruel and strong and vulnerable, the other na\u00efve and graceless. Elena follows in Lila\u2019s wake, helpless against Lila\u2019s fierce charisma. Although it is Elena who is granted the opportunity to pursue an education beyond middle school, it is Lila who directs her learning. Lila quizzes her, mocks her, competes with her. It is Lila who learns her Latin declensions first, and best. If Elena studies Greek, Lila checks out the available dictionaries from the library. By high school, Elena finds herself formulating her thoughts and arguments as Lila would, using her diction. Elena moves forward in guilt mixed with a sense of triumph\u2014it is she who is offered the education, despite knowing the Lila is her intellectual superior.Ferrante\u2019s writing is stripped to the bone, but the marrow within is so rich and satisfying. This world of post-war Naples is vivid and visceral, every line colored in with careful detail. Elena returns from several weeks of summer holiday to find ...the sun had made me shining blonde, but my face, my arms, my legs were as if painted with dark gold. As long as I had been immersed in the colors of Ischia, amid sunburned faces, my transformation had seemed suitable; now, restored to the context of the neighborhood, where every face, every street had a sick pallor, it seemed to me excessive, anomalous.The family dynamics (and there is a helpful Index of Characters at the beginning) are free-ranging and messy, feeding directly into the sea of village life\u2014secrets are on full display, feuds are fast and furious, and allegiances change as peace is brokered, then broken. These characters will consume your heart. My Brilliant Friend ends with Lila seeming to give into the inevitable: marriage at the age of sixteen. But recall that this is a story of power. And this story has only just begun."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7574349-melanie", "userReview": "\"The women in my stories are all echoes of real women who, because of their suffering or their combativeness, have very much influenced my imagination: my mother, a childhood girlfriend, acquaintances whose stories I know.

But the echo that you noticed maybe derives from an oscillation inside the characters that I\u2019ve always worked on.

Intellectual knowledge, sexual knowledge, political knowledge. What kind of knowledge does it take to get by in this world? How do we attain that knowledge? How does our knowledge change us and wound us and empower us, often at the same time? What things do we want to know and what would we prefer to leave unknown? What can we control? Who has power over our lives?\"Rachel Donadio - The New York Review of Books\"Life has actions in it. In reading a novel, it\u2019s profound to experience the self-in-other in memory or contemplation, but it\u2019s sometimes just as profound to experience the self-in-other during moments of decision. In Ferrante, we have both \u2014 they\u2019re told in the first person, but they\u2019re the story of more than a single person, of many equally weighted people. The plotting of their stories is so skillful, indeed so unplotted, in the sense that life is unplotted, in the sense that we don\u2019t know the future, that as readers we suddenly exist both in other actions and in their actors\u2019 consciousness of them. Not the latter alone.\"Charles Finch - The MillionsThere are so many layers at work in this astonishing novel that I don't even know where to begin... As soon as you start reading Elena Ferrante, you know you are in the hands of an extraordinary writer whose mind, heart and natural abilities have inextricably fused in the greatest of fires. The writing takes over your days and nights, seeps into your veins like crack. Straight into your bloodstream.Very much like Karl Ove Knausgaard, she is able to play with the clearest, most fluid language to evoke simultaneously the multitude of details of everyday life and the ever shifting patterns of the mind. The words sizzle with grace, candor, terror and light.The birth of a friendship between two little Neapolitan girls born in 1944 becomes the conduit for a ruthless and intoxicating exploration of what it means to become yourself. What is innate and what is acquired? What part of life is random luck and predestination? What part of character is emulation and what part is natural gift? How does the will to power play out if you are born poor in an uneducated and violent environment? How much does the past affect our present lives and can you escape it?I read this breathtaking book over the course of three days, almost in a trance, and it seems that I have no choice but to echo what Charles Finch wrote at the end of his piece on his year of reading in 2014 for The Millions: \"What I do know is that before 2014, I thought Philip Roth was the greatest novelist alive.

These two girls, born into poverty in 1950s Naples, forge a relationship that is both captivating and completely authentic. There is something about a novel told from the point of view of an adult looking back at his or her childhood that thoroughly captures my attention and feels so convincing. Even if I cannot relate to the circumstances or the surroundings, the emotions are so very real and bring back such sharp memories of my own inexperience and innocent yearnings. With keen insight and skillful writing, Elena Ferrante has crafted a vivid account of two young lives struggling to rise above the usual fate of those born into such harsh conditions. The impoverishment and violence of the neighborhood are part of the daily fabric of Elena and Lila\u2019s lives, but they dream of a life elevated above those around them. The key to achieving this dream \u2013 education. \"In that last year of elementary school, wealth became our obsession. We talked about it the way characters in novels talk about searching for treasure\u2026 Then, I don\u2019t know why, things changed and we began to link school to wealth. We thought that if we studied hard we would be able to write books and that the books would make us rich. Wealth was still the glitter of gold coins stored in countless chests, but to get there all you had to do was go to school and write a book.\" Oh yes, there was a time when I believed diligent studying would achieve similar results! What little girl doesn\u2019t dream of becoming rich or famous?! Both girls work hard, but it is quite evident that Lila is the dominant one in the relationship \u2013 academics come easy to her and Elena finds herself wanting to reach those same heights. She often feels inferior to Lila and it becomes her goal to keep up with her, but believing she can never surpass the brilliance of her friend. Of course, the competition between two coming-of-age girls doesn\u2019t just end at schoolwork. The fragility of such a relationship is further tested by the attraction they hold for the boys of the neighborhood. In this arena, Elena perhaps feels she has an advantage over Lila: \"In general I was the pretty one, while she was skinny, like a salted anchovy, she gave off an odor of wildness, she had a long face, narrow at the temples, framed by two bands of smooth black hair.\" However, true to the nature of girlhood, feelings of inadequacy settle in and Elena feels second-string once again. \"But Lila now had retaken the upper hand, satisfaction had magnified her beauty, while I, overwhelmed by schoolwork, exhausted by my frustrated love for Nino, was growing ugly again. My healthy color faded, the acne returned. And suddenly one morning the specter of glasses appeared.\"I couldn\u2019t help but wish that Elena would stand up for herself, value herself as an individual separate from her attachment to Lila. Lila, the leader and Elena, the follower \u2013 certainly a familiar dynamic in a friendship. I wonder who benefits most from these friendships. Perhaps Elena needed the competition to drive her own ambition and rise above her circumstances. But Lila too needed someone to ground her, give her some sense of stability in her own life. I think perhaps such relationships are fluid \u2013 giving and receiving on both ends at different times, always changing along with the trials and tribulations each experiences. Ferrante does an exceptional job of examining the complexities of friendships and this is what I found to be the most fascinating aspect of this novel. The ending leaves one with a question and the desire to grab the second book in the series. Without a doubt, I will do exactly that. I am eager to follow not just Elena and Lila\u2019s friendship but also to learn more about the fate of the large cast of characters \u2013 especially Nino, Stefano, Rino, Pasquale, Antonio, and even the city of Naples itself."}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "Much has been written about My Brilliant Friend, so I'm not sure what I can add except for a few reactions to what I see as the three main characters:< Elena -- my heart aches for you.

During the Industrial Revolution, Merthyr had briefly been the iron capital of the world, but things didn't work out; iron ore became harder to mine, the people running the refining works didn't adopt modern methods quickly enough, the town was too far from the sea. Everything fell apart, and by the 1930s unemployment was running at 80%. When I arrived with my parents in 1960, things had become a little better, but the town was still one of the poorest in Britain.Why did we move there? It was the time of the counter-culture: some idealistic peace protesters had decided to found a commune - I still have no idea why they chose Merthyr - and my parents wanted to join them. The members of the commune didn't get on, the usual story, and after a couple of years they disbanded. We were stuck in Merthyr, and that's where I grew up. I attended primary school at Heolgerrig, a little village just outside town. In summer, I walked to and from school, a pleasant trip that lasted about forty minutes. In winter, my siblings and I took the bus.There were two kinds of children at Heolgerrig. The smaller group was the contingent of middle-class kids, most of whom lived on the new estate just down the road from the school. They spoke normal English, though with a Welsh accent, and their parents had white-collar jobs. A couple of other kids also belonged to this group; the one I remember best was Avril Griffiths, the vicar's daughter. Avril was a fat, priggish girl with an annoying manner, whom I hated for all of the five years we were in the same class together. Her younger brother, Wayne, was a bully, and I hated him too. But the majority of the class was quite different. They were the children of the local working class, spoke Welsh by preference, and were poor, dirty and violent.Violence was an integral part of school life. There were fights all the time in the playground, and they weren't friendly; the kids generally wanted to hurt each other. The teachers made frequent use of physical punishment when they thought things were getting out of hand, or sometimes, I thought, just because they were crazy too. There was one particularly dangerous teacher called Mr Haines. He would yell at us when we didn't understand his questions: his favorite expression was \"Blocks of wood!\" I can hear him yelling it now. He liked to use his cane. The boys, even at age eight or nine, were already fond of playing sexual games. One day, the biggest gang started a game called \"Kiss chase\", which involved kidnapping girls and dragging them back to the boys' lavatory. I never learned exactly what happened to them there, but when Mr Haines found out he completely lost it and thrashed all the boys who had taken part. I now realise that he only hit the poor, Welsh-speaking boys. I never got hit.But this kind of violence was only a kind of muted background noise behind the real incidents, surprisingly many of which involved permanent disfigurement or death. One boy in the class above me managed to put an eye out using some wood-carving tools; another was killed when he was showing off by the side of the road and fell in front of a car. A particularly memorable and gruesome story started when the school decided to retire the ancient classroom furniture, units which had the seat attached to the desk with a heavy cast-iron frame, and replace them with modern tubular steel tables and plastic chairs. We didn't much like the change, but the upside was that the old desks had not been taken away. They were stacked in a shed out at the side of the yard, and they made a great climbing-frame. Unfortunately, they had not been stacked very carefully. One day a pile collapsed and killed a young child, not one I knew. A couple of weeks later, a fire started during the middle of the night and burned down half the school. It only occurred to me much later that these two events might have been linked. All of the foregoing, however, were still comparatively minor incidents. The big one happened at 9.15 am on October 21 1966 in Aberfan, a few miles down the road from us. A large slag-heap, which hadn't been properly maintained, suddenly turned into a landslide as a result of heavy rainfall. It buried the local school and killed (I just looked it up in Wikipedia) 116 children and 28 adults. My father wanted to go and help with the search and rescue effort; we started crying and made such a fuss that we managed to dissuade him.Anyway, what I wanted to say was that I liked this novel very much. It reminded me of my childhood.\n[To Le nouveau nom]"}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "A not so satisfying read for me.

I feel like it really got at the core of human insecurity, gender and income inequality, female friendships, and our hierarchy of needs. Somehow it\u2019s also a page-turner and an engaging story. It blows my mind that all of those things are possible in one short novel. I guarantee that it\u2019ll get under your skin and soak in.Ferrante vs. Knausgaard:Even though I\u2019ve only read this first novel in the sequence, it\u2019s hard for me to resist the urge to compare Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan series to Knausgaard\u2019s My Struggle.Both series are: multi-volume, non-English, first person page-turner novels spanning several decades of their character\u2019s lives, first published in English in 2012, with subsequent volumes appearing annually. They both feature straightforward, simple prose, detailing the ins and outs of their characters\u2019 lives, and are deeply, sometimes disturbingly honest in tone. They both tackle a lot of the same themes, but from inside different experiences. If you enjoyed one, I\u2019d highly recommend the other. Especially if your a guy who enjoyed Knausgaard, you owe it to yourself to read something similar, but from a female perspective. Ferrante\u2019s writing really put me inside that experience in an empathic way.They are also vastly different from one another: The Neapolitan Novels are fictitious, set in Italy, viscerally violent, told in a mostly linear, chronological order, feature short chapters, supposedly gained a lot in translation, are written pseudonymously, and have a tight focus on the friendship between two female characters over the years. My Struggle is wildly non-linear, purportedly autobiographical, set mostly in Norway, meandering, has no chapters whatsoever, steeped in nostalgia, and is tightly focused on Knausgaard's view of his general failings as a man, before, after, and during his journey toward becoming a writer.For more on the similarities between the two works, I\u2019d suggest Joshua Rathman\u2019s terrific essay for The New Yorker: Knausgaard or Ferrante?"}, {"userName": "Stephen Durrant", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1457001-stephen-durrant", "userReview": "As my rating reflects, I was overwhelmed by this novel. The only Ferrante novel I had read before was her \"Days of Abandonment,\" which I thought overheated (and overrated). I retract any previous negative judgment: she is a major contemporary novelist and I will now go on immediately to her second Neapolitan novel, \"The Story of a New Name.\" This is a coming of age novel, true, but it is also much more than that. The relationship between Lila and Lenu, the latter the narrator, has a bit of the Mozart-Saliari theme: the frustration of the simply smart person up against someone of almost supernatural genius. The relationship unfolds in the suburbs of Naples with a surprising reversal, as we come to realize just who the \"Brilliant Friend\" really is. And the world of 1950s and 60s Naples is a brutal one, with young men obsessed to protect brutally their own \"honor\" and the imagined \"honor\" of the girls around them. Still, there is much, much more to this novel than I can go into here--it is a complex work filled with beautiful gems, particularly toward the end. I know of the mystery surrounding Elena Ferrante and the suggestion of some that she might be a male writer assuming a female name. Maybe, but I sense something very, very authentic about the voice of Lenu and the brutalizing male world that surrounds her and cannot quite believe a man could have written this (see also James Wood's comments on this issue)."}, {"userName": "Warwick", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick", "userReview": "Early in Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights, the narrator arrives at the eponymous farmhouse and has the following exchange with the Earnshaws' servant, Joseph:\u2018What are ye for?\u2019 he shouted. \u2018T' maister's down i' t' fowld. Go round by th' end o' t' laith, if ye went to spake to him.\u2019\u2018Is there nobody inside to open the door?\u2019 I hallooed, responsively.\u2018There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer flaysome dins till neeght.\u2019Charming. Now imagine, for a moment, that the scene had instead been written like this:\u2018What do you want?\u2019 he shouted in dialect. \u2018The master's down in the fold. Go round past the end of the barn if you want to speak to him.\u2019\u2018Is there nobody inside to open the door,\u2019 I hallooed, responsively, in English.\u2018There's no one but the mistress; and she won't open even if you make that dreadful noise until nighttime.\u2019It's more immediately comprehensible, certainly; but it's productive to think about what might have been lost in such a version. This is somewhat the situation you are in with Elena Ferrante's novels, in which the use of \u2018dialect\u2019 is made to assume gigantic significance, while never actually being shown to us.At first I thought the constant dialogue tags \u2013 \u2018she said in Italian\u2019, \u2018he replied in dialect\u2019 \u2013 were a device of the translator to show where Ferrante herself was switching between standard Italian and Neapolitan. But no; in fact, the original writing is all in purest Italian and those markers (in dialetto, in italiano) are just the same for Italian readers as they are for me. While I was reading, and enjoying, this book, I was also struggling to work out what about this was bothering me.The thing is, casual readers would be forgiven for thinking that Ferrante's \u2018dialect\u2019 is some ungrammatical or degraded urban street version of Italian; in fact, of course, Neapolitan is a sister-language with a long, proud literary and administrative history. The Kingdom of Naples isn't some medieval nonentity \u2013 it lasted right up to the Risorgimento, and didn't really join \u2018Italy\u2019 until 1861. Neapolitan is no more a dialect than the Florentine dialect which has been enshrined (arbitrarily) as standard Italian. (At unification, by the way, the proportion of Italians who spoke \u2018Italian\u2019 has been estimated at no more than 2.5 percent.)I put \u2018dialogue\u2019 in inverted commas before because the words \u2018language\u2019 and \u2018dialect\u2019 do not have any scientific meaning in linguistics, and the decision to call something a dialect is, in the end, a sociopolitical one. We see in this book that people speak \u2018pure Italian\u2019, \u2018good Italian\u2019, but \u2018rough dialect\u2019, \u2018the thickest dialect\u2019; Neapolitan is what they use for shouting, swearing, insulting, getting excited. Len\u00f9's boyfriend frustrates her because \u2018he never abandoned dialect, and in dialect it was hard to discuss the corruption of earthly justice\u2019 and other high-flown intellectual topics; when he falls out with her (though this is actually at the start of the second book, not this one), it's specifically because \u2018he heard scarcely any dialect in [Len\u00f9's] voice, he noted the long sentence, the subjunctives, and he lost his temper\u2019. Even the toastmaster at Lila's wedding is originally chosen on the grounds that he \u2018had married a Florentine woman and had taken on the local accent\u2019.Of course, people really do look down on minority languages, they really are associated with poor education and low social status, and to that extent Ferrante is reflecting the reality of the situation. (In Naples as everywhere else \u2013 my wife was always told off at school in Edinburgh if she ever used \u2018heid\u2019 for \u2018head\u2019 or \u2018ken\u2019 for \u2018know\u2019.) And yet so much of the novel is about overturning preconceptions about Len\u00f9's friends and neighbours, about restoring some respect to the lives of the working class in this neighbourhood; the novel aims to give a voice to a community that a lot of people do not hear from or understand. While this is often powerfully done, the book itself, on a sociolinguistic level, is profoundly conservative. Something about this friction sat uneasily with me and modulated the way I was reacting to the story.News that RAI and HBO are producing a TV series of these books raises my hopes that a screen version will \u2013 perversely \u2013 foreground the language issue in a way that the literary version doesn't quite. Since it's being made in Italian, it's hard to imagine that the producers could duck the issue of using Neapolitan in the way that Ferrante can duck it in text \u2013 as a regional language, its use in oral contexts like film and music (\u2019O sole mio, most famously) is, I suppose, more acceptable than in print. I get a sense of how Lila and Antonio and the Solaras sound \u2013 but it's distant, even allowing for the fact that I'm reading in translation.

the moniker \u201cmy brilliant friend,\u201d but there is no question which of the two Ferrante meant. Elena continues her schooling through high school in this first installment of the trilogy of novels Ferrante has written about the two, while Lila, incandescent Lila, is held back from further schooling by her family claiming they cannot afford it. Instead, Lila takes books from a small neighborhood lending library to study on her own the subjects Elena struggles to master. Together they test one another, spiking the interest levels and capabilities of both.Ferrante captures the uncertainty and confusion of youth through the voice and perspective of Elena. But what we really want is what everyone wants\u2014the thoughts and voice of Lila. We can\u2019t get enough of her, even when we only see her from a distance. We long to know what she thinks. We know, just like Elena does, that Elena is only a conduit, pretty and clever, but a poor substitute for the real thing. If we could only get to Lila, all will become clear. Lila radiates something like unfiltered truth, understanding, knowledge. Her opinions are the ones that matter. But even then, we wonder if we would be accepted into her inner circle. Elena is our conduit.Ferrante\u2019s Neopolitan novels feel especially real when describing the resentments and jockeying for influence among the boys seeking favors of Elena and Lila, and the confusions these two radiate when considering the options left open to them in a culture not known to value contributions from the female sex beyond housekeeping and baby-making. We yearn to know, too, the thoughts and desires of the parents of Lila and Elena\u2014to know if they are being fairly portrayed by Elena or if there is something more going on which she does not have the understanding yet to relate. By the end of this, Book I of L\u2019amica genial, we get the uncomfortable feeling that we are on the edge of something unknown, that life will play out for these two much like it does for us: grasping in the dark for something we cannot see, hoping that it will bring what we imagine, not knowing which direction is the right one. This marvelous recreation of two lives in a poor neighborhood of Naples a long time ago draws us in completely and involves in in a way that only great literature can."}, {"userName": "Malia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia", "userReview": "After finishing Elena Ferrante's first novel in the Neapolitan Trilogy, I am of two minds. On the one hand, being a writer myself, it is demotivating, due to its frank brilliance; on the other, for an enthusiastic reader, it is thought-provoking and deeply engaging. And to think, this is only a translation! Though I am undeniably envious of Ferrante's beautiful skill with words, I have to acknowledge that the growing hype around her is totally warranted, and in fact, I want to add to it:-)The story is not the most remarkable, but it is the manner in which it is told that captivates the reader.There is such fervor, but it is beautifully balanced with deeply nuanced thoughtfulness. The voice of Lenu is unique, yet relatable, and the manner in which the story unfolds, at times slowly and masterfully, at other times quick and jolting, makes for a highly engaging read. I have read all three available books (The Story of a New Name, and Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay - the next one is coming out in September!!) and can only recommend them. The story grows deeper as the characters grow older, and begin to see the world around them through the eyes of young adults and grown women. Truly remarkable books!A little update: The Story of the Lost Child was a brilliant ending to this series, read them all!Update:Today Ferrante's identity has been '\"revealed\" by an intrusive article by The New York Review of Books. Though there was obviously curiosity on my part surrounding the person behind the name, the story and the imagination, I think it is important to remember she is an author, not a criminal or someone who deserves to be investigated and found out. It was her right to remain anonymous, and I find it disappointing and unethical for the Times to have outed her unwillingly.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "William1", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william1", "userReview": "An almost seamless narrative with a large and voluble cast. Author Ferrante opens Vol. 1 of her tetralogy with a classic framing device (presumably not closed until the end of Vol. 4). It's the present day and Lila's son calls Elena, who's living in Turin, to say his mother is missing from her Naples home. This sets Elena to writing about the hardscrabble yet eventful upbringing she and Lila shared in post-World War II Naples. The families are blue collar, desperately poor, for whom education is viewed as a luxury. Lila, the smarter of the two, the \"brilliant friend\" of the title, has a dream of writing novels with Elena one day. But there is no money for textbooks in the Cerrulo family, so Lila is taken out of school to help in the family cobblery and at home. Extremely shrewd and calculating, once education is excluded for Lila, she must resort to woman's traditional means of securing her future: marriage.Elena, meanwhile, partly due to coaching from Lila, makes it all the way to high school where she excels in languages and writing. But the fire for learning that Lila kindled in her begins to wane without her friend's eager presence. It's no longer much fun. Moreover, Lila's approval is the constant standard Elena aspires to, even as she meets and exceeds it.Lila and Elena's families do not live enlightened lives. Their skin is extraordinarily thin. There is an almost mystical belief in honor accompanied by its cruel machismo. They possess almost no ability to mitigate their quarrrels through language. There is much acting out, things said that would be better left unsaid. There is the threat of enormous violence which may erupt at any time. When as teens they travel to an exclusive section of Naples, because Lila wants to see it, the young men in the party, enraged by the splendor, insult a chic local couple and start a m\u00eal\u00e9e. Remarkably, though they are clearly in the wrong, the reader understands their anger and hopes they make it through unscathed. At the last moment, the hated Solaras arrive in their shiny new Fiat in a neat example of the neighborhood circling the wagons and joining forces against the outsider rich. Everyone hates the Solaras, who are successful bar and pastry shop owners as well as Camorra and live well. Rino, Lila's brother, especially hates them. When Rino is frustrated in a get rich quick shoemaking scheme with Lila, he becomes first a braggart, telling of his coming good fortune, and then a brute. He beats Lila since she will have nothing to more to do with him. Ultimately the Solaras seduce him with their money and \"prestige.\" Pathetic.Don Achille Carraci has made a career out of loan sharking and intimidation, especially of the poor. The carpenter Peluso, who gambles away his earnings every week in the Solara bar, conceives a murderous hatred for the gangster, eventually stabbing him to death. Peluso is jailed but the neighborhood breathes a sigh relief now that the menacing Don is gone. But the Don's work is in a sense finished. For the Carracci sons have taken over the convict-carpenter's shop and turned it into a grocery, which seems to continually expand and prosper. Lila grows to become the most beautiful of the two friends. Marcello, a despised Solara, shows up at her parent's flat with food and a television and wine and other goodies. He dines over there every night for weeks on end, providing much of the fine food himself. Expensive items the family could never afford. All this as a means of allying the parents with his suit, but Lila hates his guts because he's Camorra, a mafioso. Her ultimate rejection of Marcello reduces him to sobs. Later, like a child, he retaliates with ridiculous calumny, besmirching her reputation.Lila is headstrong. Her beauty captivates men and makes women jealous\u2014including, sometimes, Elena, our narrator. Lila has turned from ugly duckling to magnificent swan. When she dumps Marcello and Stefano Achille, the Don's son, whisks her off in a car full of money, we begin to wonder if she's sold out. The end of Vol. 1 is a humdinger. I don't want to give it away. Suffice it to say, that Stefano and Lila marry at a hugely expensive wedding and Marcello, whom Lila does not want there, attends anyway.On to Vol. 2..."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3073544-david", "userReview": "First, allow me to disclaim my prejudice: I am not, generally speaking, a fan of the coming-of-age of novel. There are only so many times that a reader can be reasonably expected to suffer through the (often universal) discoveries that occasion childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. I wasn't a huge fan of weathering these experiences first hand (\"Bullying, wet dreams, and death! Oh my!\"), so I'm not exactly jonesing for a revisit. I alluded to one of the major problems of the coming-of-age novel just now: many of these milestones are universal, and as such we all have some experience with them. Sure, a given author may put his or her own psychological spin on the horrors of adolescence, but the terrain is pretty well-trodden by now. A girl's first period, for example, and the complex emotions which attend it have seemingly been exhaustively chronicled. As a male, I have obviously never had a first period, but the accumulation of so many books, television shows, and movies (and\u2014no\u2014not just Carrie) have brought me as close to the experience as I think I will ever get. You might well argue that there are plenty of aspects of life that are returned to again and again in literature and yet will never be entirely \"used up.\" And you're right. But the thing about coming-of-age novels is that they focus on children, whose limited experience of the world ensure a certain similarity of response. Children are generally not \"worldly\" or \"sophisticated,\" so they react to the newness of experience in a fairly predictable fashion. There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but as \"they\" say, these only reinforce the rule.Based on what I've just told you, I probably shouldn't like Elena Ferrante's My Brilliant Friend. It's the story of two girls (Elena, the narrator, and Lila, her wild and beautiful friend) who live in the slums of Naples, Italy, and navigate the unremittingly steep ascent of young adulthood. Much of the standard coming-of-age fodder is represented here, of course, but Ferrante does something with it that I can't quite quantify. Her prose is neither overtly poetic nor deeply introspective; at first glance, it appears inconspicuous, casual, loose. There's nothing about it (at least in translation) that strikes one immediately as the work of a great stylist. But this is one of those novels which doesn't offer itself to readers in pages or paragraphs or individual moments. My Brilliant Friend seduces its audience cumulatively: the details and drama accrue gradually, like the construction of a great building, until one day you can finally discern the prospective shape of it and understand its beauty. Ferrante is cobbling together a world of such vivacity that it almost doesn't even matter what happens in this world. It's true and real and tangible and it's just like watching life in all its lived-in splendor.I'm not saying that the world Ferrante offers us is a place of beauty\u2014because it's not\u2014but any writer who understands how to translate life\u2014any instance of life\u2014to the page with such force and persuasiveness has created beauty through her work. And as I glance back over some of the pages, which are hardly miraculous in and of themselves, I wonder how she did it. You can easily tell what's exceptional about some writers\u2014Pynchon, Delillo, DFW\u2014but Ferrante's talents seem almost metaphysical. Where do they come from? How do they work?So to return to the beginning of this review for a moment\u2014you know, where I disclaimed my prejudice... It's important to remind myself that it is a prejudice. Any topic, any story, any worldview in the hands of a great writer (or even a pretty good writer) can be worthwhile, and I'd have to say that Ferrante is a pretty damn good writer\u2014maybe even a great one, but I'll have to read more to know for sure.

acclaimed authors, My Brilliant Friend is a rich, intense and generous hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante's inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.", "title": "My Brilliant Friend\n      \n          (L'amica geniale #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35036409-my-brilliant-friend", "average": 3.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1493655783l/35036409.jpg", "reviews": 12206, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44085.Elena_Ferrante", "name": "Elena Ferrante"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/183680.Ann_Goldstein", "name": "Ann Goldstein"}], "type": ["Historical", "Abandoned", "European Literature", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35036409-my-brilliant-friend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13586707-my-brilliant-friend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18334881-my-brilliant-friend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12913570-l-amica-geniale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23151453-genialna-przyjaci-ka", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28366993-l-amie-prodigieuse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29984146", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31362422-moja-genijalna-prijateljica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465515-the-story-of-a-new-name", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23156040-those-who-leave-and-those-who-stay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25242224-the-story-of-the-lost-child", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77810.The_Days_of_Abandonment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1058564.The_Lost_Daughter"]}
