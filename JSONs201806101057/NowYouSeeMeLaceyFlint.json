Shadows of a dark figure much to the likes of Jack around every corner.Now here's where I'd like to walk around inside the mind of the very talented Sharon Bolton. Oooh! Or maybe not.......Sharon Bolton introduces us to her quite complicated character, Lacey Flint, a young detective constable working the crime scenes of London. The intense story grabs you from the first pages as Lacey comes upon the savage attack of a young woman. With only moments of life beating within her, the young woman grabs the doorhandle of Lacey's car leaving far more than her blood in the aftermath. Lacey is determined to find out what had happened to this unfortunate girl.When a quirky journalist informs Lacey that she has received an anonymous letter from the possible killer, Lacey meets with her. There's more than a jumble of words here. Lacey's own name appears on the page. From every indication, it's evident that a sadistic, psychopathic predator is standing in their midst. As the story unfolds, Lacey recognizes the parallels to the Ripper murders from times, dates, and manner. And who possesses the depth of evil likened to the one whose name is recognized even today as one of the worst heartless, savage serial killers of all time? Lacey is assisted by DI Mark Joesbury who doesn't quite know what to make of Lacey's sixth sense and her tilted police procedures. He watches her like a hawk for many a reason.Bolton serves up an intensely good storyline here. It's like entering into a multifaceted, lively beehive with chambers that go on and on into unexpected and untapped experiences. Just when you think you've got a handle on all this, Bolton swings in another direction. It's a smart, smart read that touches on the mayhem of the Ripper murders while laying it all out for modern eyes to peruse.Sharon Bolton, I'm in for the long haul. Locked in and ready for more and more."}, {"userName": "Maureen Carden", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54932249-maureen-carden", "userReview": "I have read Now You See Me (NYSM) an embarrassing number of times. The superb plotting, fascinating characters and spooky settings keep drawing me back in. Of course the problem with re-reading this book is that I never have the shivery thrill of the first time. I don't care. It's still worth it. With my first reading, Bolton kept me guessing throughout the book until I figured something out and then realized, no, I had not. On subsequent readings I read for the pure pleasure of language, plotting and characterization. NYSM preceded all of those Gone Girl Bad on a Train With a Terrible Marriage books (apologies to someone) outshining all of those supposed twisty turny books. Ms Bolton is the James Bond of twisty writers. \"Nobody does it better.\"  DC Lacey Flint is the only witness to the death of a woman who dies in her arms. She is re- assigned to the Lewisham nick so she can continue doing her own non -related investigations into the under-reported sexual assaults of adolescent and teenage immigrant women. This keeps DC Flint easily available to the Major Incident Team for questioning. The MIT is headed by DI Dana Tulloch in a welcome return from Sacrifice. As a witness Flint is not supposed to be involved with the investigation but her expertise on Jack the Ripper comes in handy when a copycat calls her out. DC Flint then goes from ripperologist to ripper bait as it becomes apparent this really is all about her.  No one knows why, but when DC Flint figures it out, she's not about to tell anyone. She is just going to end the murder spree. This is not foolishly going into the scary basement territory- although she does- this is to save the life she has made for herself. Lacey is a mess, but a mess readers grow to care about. Her secrets have secrets. A beautiful woman, Lacey tries to hide her looks and to stay as much in the background as possible. She keeps a boxing heavy bag dressed as man in her garden shed. Her apartment is a white box with no sign of her personality. Lacey seeks anonymous sex because she thinks she will always be unable to have a real relationship. This is put to the test when she meets DI Mark Joesbury, a close friend of DI Tulloch.  Ultimately, lack of trust between Lacey and her co-workers end with Lacey having to making excruciating choices to save loved ones. There is not a wasted word, an overdone scene or an off note in this book. As an added bonus I also come away from most of Ms Bolton's books more informed on a social issue than when I started the book."}, {"userName": "Delee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6168268-delee", "userReview": "Usually when there is even a mention of Jack the Ripper in a book's description, I quickly add it to my \"to read\" list. This time I hesitated for bit because this was a modern copy cat Jack the Ripper. Part of the enjoyment I get from reading fiction novels based on \"Jack's\" murder spree is because of when the killings took place... London 1888-Horse drawn carriages clip clopping down dark cobbled streets, the man in the in the black cloak, and hat disappearing into the fog. Scotland Yard working with only eye witnesses and hand written letters possibly sent by the murderer. No cell phones, no internet, no DNA. ...but this was one of those times when the cover of the book called to me, and I thought I would give it a chance. NOW YOU SEE ME did not disappoint.London 2011- After interviewing a potential witness in a rape case, DC Lacey Flint walks out to her car and stumbles upon a dying woman-Geraldine Jones. Later a letter is sent to the office of a local reporter. Dear Miss BosstonI keep on hearing Saucy Jacky is back. How I have laughed. Is it true?If it is, I hope the police are clever, and on the right track.Ask DC Flint for me - Did the lady squeal? No time to clip her ears but plenty of times for funny little games.Yours truly,A f(r)iendHope you like the red proper stuffThe killer is re-creating the crimes of Jack the Ripper, and Geraldine Jones, is only the first.Many fiction novels have been based on the Jack the Ripper Killings, but this one definitely has a style of it's own. Not just the modern twist, there is so much more going on than just the murders. Lacey Flint is a complex, dark character, and I found her back story just as riveting as the mystery she is trying to solve."}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "[(or slice up with a knife!)

I could have eaten this up in one day if this week hadn't been so busy. This book is the first in the Lacey Flint series and it started (and ended) with a bang. Clearly I'm late to the party and most everyone has read this book already, but I'm happy to have joined in. Without giving too much away, this novel is based around the fact that a Jack the Ripper copy cat is on the loose and it is up to the MIT to stop him. As the book progresses, we begin to learn more about Lacey's past and her own secrets. There is a little romance as well; I enjoyed it because it wasn't over the top or distracting from the story. The ending had so many twists and turns I think I have whiplash, but I enjoyed every second. I would immediately recommend this book to anyone looking for a new suspense/thriller/mystery series without a ton of books to catch up on (there's only 4 so far; 5 if you count the short story). I've already requested the next in the series and am excited to continue Lacey's story!"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol", "userReview": "I'm becoming a big fan of S.J. Bolton. It's not that there's anything terribly new here but I like the way this woman thinks and puts a story together. Interestingly, I read Dead Scared, the second Lacey Flint outing, first. What made me go back and read the first \"Now You See Me\" was the excellent interview and talk with the author on The Readers , July 2nd. Part of The Readers Summer Reading Club, the first segment was a talk with S.J. Bolton, intrigued me to go back and set the Lacey Flint character in my mind. I postponed the last segment of the podcast, loaded with spoilers, until after I read the book. That I read \"Dead Scared\" first didn't hamper my enjoyment of either but I did learn things about Lacey that I didn't know in \"Now You See Me\". The character Lacey Flint and her interaction with other members of the London Police is what makes the read for me. The mindset of a female policewoman, her means of detection, her working relationship with male staff, and general dealings with the public, are interesting to explore. \"Now You See Me\" is classed as crime fiction. I do like crime but I love it when it has strong psychological themes as well as some good twists and turns. One review that I read thought there was nothing original in \"Now You See Me\"; that this story has been told before. I think that is true of many books, the old how many plots are there question. Hey, there is a murder, there is a killer, there is a person trying to find the killer and prevent more killing. This simple story can be \"new\" depending on how the author chooses to get you from point to point. I think S.J.'s plotting and writing is excellent and well thought out. She herself states that she leads you a bit in \"Now You See Me\" and she'd be surprised if you could not figure out a few things for yourself. Yes, I did, but this made me think about the character of Lacey more, comparing her to people in my own life, who sometimes make me step back and wonder about who they really are. I also loved the back story of the homeless which is termed \"sleeping rough\". It almost worries me how well Bolton writes these scenes. This worry also relates to the theme of rape and violence to women. If this is not enough there's a bit of history regarding \"Jack the Ripper\" which should interest fans of this long unsolved case. There's also a bit of music running throughout the story and one particular song that will keep sounding in my head as the story fades and I'm on to something new. One point to ponderFlint states \"We were taught in training that it's human instinct to turn left rather than right, and that, with no other motivation, people will head to their left\" Now I always thought that we look left and turn right when entering a venue. I wonder if this is due to our different driving habits.Bolton says she does not intend to keep Flint going forever. Her fans might demand she does. I hope she sticks to her guns and maybe does one or two more, which allows for fleshing out the character and her relationships to a natural end. Bolton has written stand-alone books. I enjoyed \"Sacrifice\" and will definitely seek out the others as well as any new ones she writes."}, {"userName": "Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh", "userReview": "[ Most women, once they reach their mid twenties, will have had at least one cervical examination.

We both picked a book for each other to read that we knew the other would never pick themselves. (My choice for her was Bird Box) MUAHAHAHA My first experience with Sharon Bolton (Little Black Lies) was nothing to write home about. Chris has been nipping in my ear for awhile now about giving the author a second chance, and I am glad that she did. Reading  Now You Can See Me was a completely different experience and even felt like it was written by a completely different author.This is book 1 in a police procedural series that features Lacey Flint. With minimal backstory provided, I still found myself drawn to this character. She's tough on the outside, but there is a vulnerability that peeks through and I can tell that book 1 barely touched the surface of who Lacey Flint truly is.Strong character development shines through here, but the other thing that really drew me in was Bolton's descriptive writing style. I feel better acquainted with London now, and being that it's on my bucket list to visit, I have now added Camden Stable Market to my growing list of places to see.Her ability to paint pictures, whether it's describing of a physical object/location or describing the feel of the night/atmosphere, it really made me feel a part of what was going on.Why not a 5 star rating you wonder? If you have noticed, I haven't really touched on my thoughts about the story-line...this is because it's the only area where I felt a bit cheated.The plot is solid, drawing off the Jack-The-Ripper copycat theme, but so much more involved. I loved the research involved and even found myself looking up references online, including some of the pictures of the murder scenes, including the bodies! (I found it fascinating that these photo's where taken in 1888 and now available for all to see) It's the ending where I felt a bit robbed of some closure. I still have some questions rolling around in my head about why certain things were enacted the way they were. The final confrontation between the killer and leading lady felt a bit flat as well. I was expecting more of a showdown.All-in-all though, this is a SOLID mystery that has left me wanting more...Way to go Chris, you made me a fan!!

It took forever to get my hands on this book and then it took me forever to read it, howver, despite the fact that I never thought of it as a can't-put-it-down-page-Turner, this was a very solid book.Now You See Me is the first in the Lacey Flint series by S.J. Bolton who also publishes under Sarah Bolton. Someone in London is copying Jack the Ripper's murders and the MET is called in to investigate. The twist is that the murders are not random and DI Flint appears to in the center of it all.The research on the actual Ripper murders was truly excellent. As an historian I appreciate this type of accuracy and the documentation at the end notes for additional reading as well. Hilton's writing is very good although at times I felt I was given tidbits of information regarding the character's background for shock value rather than simply allowing me to know the characters. This isn't the 20th century. I don't care if someone has a \"partner\" rather than husband. Annoying. The ending more than made up for it all though. No matter what you suspected throughout the book, the ending still is a surprise and very well written.

(Sharon) Bolton. This book was brilliant! Very engrossing and intricate plot line. Highly recommended. Will definitely be going through all her works including this series. This book was the first in the Lacey Flint series. She has written several stand alone novels including Sacrifice her debut novel which I mistook for the first in the Lacey Flint series. I have heard so many good things about this series I was looking for the beginning and discovered all S.J. (Sharon) Bolton's other novels. I read a lot of crime/police procedurals/thrillers and this one had more twists and turns it was dizzying, and I never guessed any of them, much less the outcome, which was truly amazing. I can't recommend this author highly enough, I am already on the second book in the series. I like my crime reads to be unpredictable, graphic, and gruesome and this fit the bill perfectly. This also fits under the category of medical thriller because all the accurate medical jargon and forensic elements. It even has historical elements to it following Jack-the-Ripper copycat storyline.

Here's my take on this mystery subgenre and my review of a British Gothic thriller writer's fourth book!)My first reading passion was for the tales of mystery and suspense called Modern Gothic thrillers. From the time I was old enough to peruse the adult section of the public library in that small Southern town where I grew up, I hunted down the novels of Daphne Du Maurier, Anya Seton, Mary Stewart, and fell in love with the prolific Barbara Mertz writing as Barbara Michaels, who eventually published thirty of her wonderful tales of suspense. In an introductory essay touting a 2008 English course at CUNY called \"The Gothic Experience,\" a Professor Melani attributes the first great practitioner of the Gothic novel to Ann Radcliffe, the most popular and best paid novelist of eighteenth century England . Radcliffe \"added suspense, painted evocative landscapes and moods or atmosphere, portrayed increasingly complex, fascinatingly-horrifying, evil villains, and focused on the heroine and her struggle with him.\" Her best works, the professor continues, are A SICILIAN ROMANCE (1790), THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO (1794) and THE ITALIAN (1797). Although Professor Melani would not include popular Gothic fiction in the course readings, she talks of these Modern Gothic or Gothic Romance novels and states that Daphne DuMaurier's REBECCA (1938) is the quintessential Modern Gothic Thriller. I wonder what Professor Melani would think of British writer S. J. Bolton? Bolton has written four Gothic thrillers. I recently wrote a review of her fourth thriller, NOW YOU SEE ME, which I titled \"The High Priestess of Rural Gothic Crime Goes Urban\":Over in Harrogate, England the third week of July 2011, they dubbed S. J. Bolton the high priestess of rural gothic crime. Her third book BLOOD HARVEST was shortlisted for the Theakston Old Peculier mystery novel of the year at the Harrogate festival. This title is apt: all three of Bolton's previous mysteries are \"lush with creepy British atmosphere.\" Bolton's award-winning debut novel SACRIFICE is set on a Shetland Island. The next two novels are set in isolated British villages. The narrators, or main female characters, are strong, professional women (an obstetrician, a veterinarian, and a psychiatrist) and at least one female in the books is deformed or disabled. There's also a hint of romance and dark family secrets. Reviewers have called Bolton the \"new queen of suspense\" and after a bit of flap reading of her fourth novel, this reader thought she was about to read \"Mary Higgins Clark goes to London.\"Well, so much for flap reading! NOW YOU SEE ME is not only a fine example of a Modern Gothic thriller, it's a police procedural! The narrator of the novel is one D. I. Lacey Flint of the Sapphire unit (crimes against women) of the London Metro Police. She has been on the force for four years. She is a Ripperologist. That's right, an expert in the Jack the Ripper five canonical cases of 1888-89. The five undisputed Ripper Crimes. It seems Lacey, after interviewing a victim of gang rape in a seedy part of London, discovers the first modern-day copycat Ripper victim on August 31 the day Polly Nichols' body was found in Victorian London some eleven decades previously. And other victims follow. For the first part of NOW YOU SEE ME, we are smothered in Ripper lore, gory description, and lectures. (Bolton has well researched the subject. She lists among other references ANATOMY OF A KILLER by Patricia Cornwell.) If you are squeamish about the Ripper stuff and skim the first half of the book, slow down about Chapter 59. A suspect has been found through DNA on the third victim. The Major Investigation Team is celebrating the close of the case. And into the Squad Room walks the fathers of a private school's rowing team with their solicitors. It seems the first four modern-day victims were mothers of the young rowers. Get ready for a FIVE STAR finish! And Gothic lovers, don't dismay! The elements are there. A freelance journalist named Emma Boston, with a missing right ear and burn marks on her neck, befriends our protagonist. D. I. Mark Joesbury becomes both romantically interested in Lacey and suspicious of her spotty background. Lacey herself is rather enigmatic and slips down to Camden late at night for sexual adventure. And Julie Andrews sings \"My Favourite Things\" in her head throughout the book."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "A 'Jack the Ripper' copycat is murdering women in London and - like the original Ripper - is taunting the press and the cops. The copycat seems to be focusing attention on beautiful Detective Constable Lacey Flint, who had the bad luck to find the first victim moments after she was attacked. Because Lacey was first on scene - and happens to be an expert on Ripper lore - she's asked to assist with the investigation being run by Dana Tulloch, head of the Major Investigative Team. Also assisting with the investigation is rugged, handsome Detective Inspector Mark Joesbury. Joesbury seems to be suspicious of Lacey for several reasons: she was right there at the first murder, she has a shady background and used to live rough on the streets of London, and she picks up men for one-night stands. In his eyes, Lacey's a suspect in the Ripperish killings. Of course this doesn't stop sparks of attraction from igniting between Lacey and Joesbury. Unlike the original Ripper, who murdered down-trodden prostitutes, the copycat targets stylish middle-class women with families. The copycat does, however, seem to be following the Ripper's timetable and modus operandi: mutilating the women, removing body parts, and so on. The police have trouble finding a connection between the copycat's victims, but once they do, DC Lacey Flint is panic-stricken for reasons that are revealed as the story unfolds.The copycat is very clever at misdirection and leaving false clues, and Lacey keeps endangering herself by plunging into situations without appropriate backup, etc. Luckily, Joesbury is usually around to lend a hand. Eventually the police identify a suspect who has a likely motive, and this eventually leads to a dramatic climax. I liked the mystery aspects of the book and thought the killer's motive was believable. I also felt most of the main characters were compelling, though I think the author does better fleshing out female characters than male characters. The real Ripper 's history and mythology - sprinkled through the story - add interest. Moreover, Lacey's (and I guess the author's) theory about the original Ripper's identity is clever and plausible.I'm not a big fan of romance in mysteries so I didn't enjoy the 'push and pull' between Lacey and Joesbury as they dealt with their attraction. However, readers who enjoy romantic suspense will probably like these parts. :) Overall, a good beginning to the Lacey Flint series, recommended to fans of the genre.You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185509-melissa", "userReview": "Wow!

Bolton novels under my belt now, and I am hooked on this author's writing style (think of a much grittier, modern Mary Stewart).Bolton has crafted an intense, atmospheric, and twist-laden tale of a young female Detective Constable with \"issues\", a modern day Jack-the Ripper copycat killer (oh, goody!) and all the page-turning, stomach-churing excitement you could find from the mystery/police procedural genre.There's nothing clunky about Bolton's style. It has a nuance and a depth to counter balance all the blood, gore and misery you'll find between it's pages. For fans of The Ripper, there's plenty of backstory on Saucy Jack and his murderous killing spree in 1888. But the heart of the story really lies with our scarred and not-so-reliable heroine, Lacey Flint. You might not particularly like her or admire her actions, but you can't deny she's an intriguing character (at least I couldn't). Lacey's journey in search of the elusive killer will re-open old wounds, but bring her to the road she needs to travel.Taking off 1/2 a star for a lackluster romance added in the plot. Meh, I can live without romance in this genre, especially when it's not particularly well done or believable.

This book centres around the death of Geraldine Jones,the first victim of a killer who,we learn,is mirroring his attacks on none other than Jack the Ripper!! Lacey Flint,a police woman who finds the first victim,quickly becomes involved in the case. What follows is one of the best storylines that I've had to pleasure of reading,with the myriad twists and turns that,for me,made this tale deeply compelling. Woven into the 'who done it' background,we are privy to the slow burning romance between Lacey and her superior,Mark Jonesbury.I must admit to loving the initial animosity and mistrust evident between these two characters only for their working relationship to hint at the promise of much,much more. As the end of the book beckoned,I believed myself to be very clever and thought I knew the identity of the killer and how the plot would resolve. Was I right? Evidently not,but the sheer surprise and shock I got when reading the reveal was breathtaking and the final words were the perfect way to end this amazing book. I loved every minute I spent with Lacey,Mark and the team.Ms Bolton has a gift when it comes to weaving an intriguing,deeply gratifying and satisfying read. She has crafted a fantastic tale,one done with care and attention to detail.I highly recommend this book and must state that I take my hat off to Ms Bolton for penning this exciting and thrilling read!! Enjoy!!"}, {"userName": "Tim The Enchanter", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5654692-tim-the-enchanter", "userReview": "[ Each of the murders could have been committed by Lacey. Body parts, knifes and forensic evidence were continually found by her and linked her to the murders. It was unrealistic that only DC Jonesberry suspected her. The author clearly wants the reader to question if Lacey is the murderer. The trail of evidence easily implicated her, as least circumstantially. It was simply nonsensical that she would be used on the investigations.

Thank you to everyone who recommended it in \"A Good Thriller's: PIFM\". I enjoyed it immensely.You know how to tell a fan-*******-tastic book...to be able to read it twice in eleven months. Sharon Bolton is currently my favourite writer. When I became acquainted with her and Slaughter this year, I knew I'd found my favourite new female authors. But Bolton, she just blows me away. I find her plots just so well written. Better than anyone else's. Mind you, I'm no expert. However, this book in particular, does blow me away. Dead Scared, I could almost rate a four after this reread. I recognized some of the plot in that one right away. This one is really a ten as far as I'm concerned. Just when you think you have it figured out she twists you around a little bit more. Can't wait to get to book three before Christmas. PS I am totally in fanGirl love with Joesbury. <3"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "3.5 Stars. A good crime mystery with an eerie Jack The Ripper copycat connection to the murder's committed over a decade ago. About one third of the way in, I could not put the book down thinking 5 stars all the way, but then the focus of the murder investigation changed and my interest ebbed a bit. Still enjoyed it, but am hoping Detective Lacey Flint will be more convincing in her role in book #2 with a greater developed relationship to Joesbury.I know I'm in the minority with my rating, but still look forward to seeing what happens next."}, {"userName": "Skip", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip", "userReview": "Detective Constable Lacey Flint finds a dying woman with her throat slit. Flint's day job is investigating crimes against women, but when a local reporter gets a note linking the woman's murder to the famous Jack the Ripper killings in Victorian-era London, Flint's detailed knowledge of them brings her into the investigation, despite her witness status. And, the killer is leaving special personal clues for her, making her a possible suspect. This time though, the victims are not destitute prostitutes, but wealthy women. About halfway through, they catch the killer, who drowns in the Thames, who claims he was set up. When the killings continue, the police find the common thread between the victims, leading to a highly implausible ending. The book is very dark, and while I will read another in the series, I did not particularly care for Flint nor the attractive male detective, trying to protect her."}, {"userName": "Stefanie", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19519895-stefanie", "userReview": "Rating: 4 stars I really enjoyed this book and I will definitely pick up the next one in the series. Sadly I think this could have been 5 stars but I just read it at the wrong time. Life kept pulling me away from my reading so it ended up being broken up and choppy and I didn't have a chance to emotionally connect with the plot or the characters but that's my problem.Bolton does a great job weaving the historical true crime case of Jack the Ripper into the modern crime spree with detail and accuracy ( at least based on research I did on the topic years ago).She had two different \"mysteries\" unfolding simultaneously, if you will, and the eventual disclosure was shocking for me.

I mean I liked the book, it was well-written, had interesting characters and the story was good with some nice twists. But I just never really got \"into\" the story, sure the Jack the Ripper copycat story was good and I liked that Lacey Flint had some really dark secrets that she really needed to keep away from the Met. I also liked Detective Inspector Dana Tulloch and Mark Joesbury. I especially liked the love-hate relationship between Lacey and Mark. I just wish the story had been more intense. I never had the \"OMG what is going to happen next feeling\" while I read the book. Not even at the end.But the ending as good despite the lack of real intensity.

Since then I'd finally figured out that my love in this \"crime/mystery/suspense/psychopathic killers/ horror crime/ psychological thrillers/ adventure thrillers/courtroom procedurals/police procedurals/ detective series\", ad infinitum field is held primarily by detective mysteries, if possible not too gory, and with mounting suspense, interesting characters and usually a detective who becomes a bit of a literary buddy. Yeah, I know... Picky, aren't I? Blame it on an early childhood imprinted with Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys and The Bobbsy Twins! Today, my measure of the ultimate prime pick in my favourite category is just about any novel by Elizabeth George, a Canadian living and writing in the U.K.. For over a decade she has written about her team's personal sagas, in hefty tomes, as they pursue crimes with infinite complications. They take her years to write - and are perhaps an unfair comparison. With so many here on Goodreads extolling Lacey Flint, and using Bolton's standalone as a hopeful measure, I dived in to \"Now You See Me\" enthusiastically. A Jack the Ripper copycat killer attacking London. Detective Lacey Flint, on a different case, happens upon the first victim and from then on vacillates between being a suspect herself, a possible victim and a source of Ripper history for the investigators. A crime committed eleven years earlier, the events in the present and the murders of a century ago begin to collide as the insanity continues. Somehow, Lacey feels it has a connection to her. I disliked Lacey, knowing so little about her initially. She went from helpless wimp, to a bar cruising bad girl, a flippant mouthpiece rebellious with the smart, attractive officer both looking out for her safety and enlisting her in the investigation and then to an aching, soft eyed beauty keening for love. Her actions and emotions irritated me so much that by the time of the book's conclusion, Lacey had lost all appeal. The twisted ending, which I had pretty much inferred long before, had me shrugging my shoulders. Find the crazy, you find the cleaver... sigh. Not sure if I want to continue investing my upcoming precious reading hours with Lacy Flint. I'm kind of disappointed. Still looking for another Peter Robinson or Liz George... Three stars...because I thought that Mark Joesbury was a really great character."}, {"userName": "Sean Peters", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14058345-sean-peters", "userReview": "HiMy second book in a row from this author.
