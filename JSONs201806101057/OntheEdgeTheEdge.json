Well, sometimes reading UF/PNR is a little bit like that. Most authors think they can hand you chocolates, flowers, promises they don't intend to keep (Richelle Mead I am looking at you!)Every now and again though, an author does something special. Something above and beyond that makes our bookish, young but strong and passionate hearts skip a beat before we say: \"To hell with it! Beastiality can't be that bad!\" Or at least, I think that was the point Disney was trying to get at...Well, this is Ilona Andrews giving us a whole library instead of a box of chocolates and a sleazy grin.This is the story of Rose who works a minimum wage cleaning job and cares for her two young brothers with her grandmother. She lives on the Edge. There is our world which is completely normal. There is another ghost world occupying the same space in a different reality. This world is called the Weird and it is your typical \"magical\" world. Then there is the Edge which occupies a middle ground between the two. It is populated with crazy rednecks and people who are probably not embarrassed enough about how interrelated they are. This Edge factor gives the novel that nice, isolated feel that you have when reading any good fairy tale. It's this world but it has it's own rules and its own ways.On The Edge is almost not a UF/PNR (Somebody tell me the difference these days?) it's more like what I always imagined that the genre should be which is a modern day fairy tale.It has the \"prince\" performing challenges to win the lady's affection, it has a modern setting but the place where our heroine lives is half magical and half plain-old batshit insane. Fights, challenges, crazy antics. Rose is a fantastic character. She's not your badass mainstay of the genre. She has a magical ability that she has spent years cultivating but that is the only thing that separates her from others. Her main concern is putting food on the table for her brothers. There's a lot to say about this book but I'm concerned about the drool getting on my keyboard so let's sum it up with a math puzzle.Take the assumption that based on the Kate Daniel's series, Ilona Andrew's series trend toward getting more awesome with each book as they go. Kind of the antithesis of Richelle Mead. By my calculations, the fourth book in this series will be so good that it will simultaneously cure all cancer and perform the best oral sex of your life.She has an ARC...Now if that isn't a ringing endorsement to go pick up this book, I don't know what is."}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "[he's slightly dead too, but that's another problem (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "2/7/18 - ON SALE for $2.99:  http://amzn.to/2fjeyMR1/19/16: Bring on THE EDGE with my fellow addicts at  IAA .

But since I trusted the authors, I decided to keep reading.And I'm glad I did.Don't worry, there's a good (non-rapey) explanation for Declan's atrocious behavior!The story?Well, Rose lives in The Edge. Which, kind of reminded me of a backwards swampy voodoish area.No offense to anyone who lives in a backwards swampy voodoo part of the country.There's magic there, but not as much as there is in The Wild.Now, the Wild is where all of the powerful magic users live. They don't have technology there, but they do have laws and a justice system. Which is more than the people in the Edge have.And then there's The Broken.That's where we, and the People Of Walmart live. And Walmart is almost a character in this novel because it's Rose's go-to place to shop for everything. Seriously, poor chick spends almost as much time there in this book as I do in real life.Speaking of, would it KILL them to put a few more cashiers on during the day?! I'm not getting any younger standing in this line. It's like, 50 deep, and wrapping around into the frozen foods section!Don't worry Walmart, those of us who are perpetually broke will continue to flock to your doors, standing side by side with the unwashed masses in order to take advantage of your unbeatable low prices. Oh, and for the prompt & friendly customer service...Ugh. Where was I?Ok, yes. The Broken. Rose has the ability (like most folks who live in the Edge) to go back and forth between the two places, so she supports her two young brothers by working (under the table) in our world. If it sucks so bad in Swampland, why don't the people who live there just head on over to the magical (and clean) Wild?I'm glad you asked!Most of the Edgers don't have enough magic to cross over into that...dimension, I guess you would call it. So, they're stuck in Hillbillyville.Anyway, Rose is trying to eek (yes, eek, not eke. She's frigging scared shitless, Tadiana) out an existence, while staying under the radar, because she has some powerful mojo that makes her a target. More specifically, unscrupulous families want her for a broodmare. Ewww, right?And that's where the story starts out. But there's a whole lot more to this one than just that. A villain from the Wild is on the loose in the Edge, there's a feral shapeshifter hunting in the area, and lots of backwoods politics being played by the people in Rose's small town. Plus, she's got to come up with a way to get rid of her unwanted suitor, before he clubs her over the head and drags her back to his cave.Except things aren't always what they seem...If you like urban fantasy, or you're looking for something to read while you're waiting for the next Kate Daniels book to come out, give this one a shot."}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "Yes, I am reading this again....Yes, I just read this like 6 months ago....No, I am not sorry half star bump up to a solid 4 stars.How do you make a book you enjoyed the first time you read it even better?Easy, find a group of friends to read it with all over again. Thanks to my fellow IA lovers I'd include all your names in this review but there were about 20 of us at Ilona Andrews Addicts (IAA) for making this one of my funnest rereads of a book (The other being Burn For Me)I have had to date.\nRose: My super strong heroine I liked you even more. She is the one person that truly deserved a Prince Charming but she isn't going to make it easy one him.\n\u201cI want you to swear that you won\u2019t attempt to molest me.\u201d He looked her over very slowly. \u201cIf I chose to molest you, it wouldn\u2019t be an attempt.

Few places are.\nDeclan: I liked you so much more this second time through. You are very much Prince Charming with a side of snarky attitude. You had me forever at \n\nYou're the measure of my wrath\n\nGeorgie and Jack: Are adorable as young brothers always looking out for each other and in desperate need a of male role model. I freaking want to take them home with me.Well worth the reread and I look forward to the Buddy read of the next book in this series.Original Review March 20133.5 StarsIlona Andrews seems to weave reality and magic together in a way few other authors do. In the world of the Edge you are in-between two dimensions, one that has no magic and one that is completely magic. Rose has lived in this world her whole life and is an anomaly to it. It has made her life difficult and she has learned to trust no one except for her family.\n\u201cLiving in your dreams meant bitter disappointment when you woke up.\u201d\nRose is raising her two younger brothers and that is a feat in itself as one is a changling and the other a necromancer. Despite being downtrodden and poor Rose is a remarkably likable character. She is honest, prideful and will not take advantage of those around her no matter how they have treated her in the past.When Declan shows up, a Blueblood from the Magic dimension, Rose is sure he will be like all the others that have tried to steal her away. She doesn\u2019t trust him but knows that her magic can\u2019t beat his. They come to an arrangement of sorts and Declan is cleaver and finds a way to stay with Rose while he tries to win her affection.\n\u201cOur standard rate. A doubloon a day.\"It was generous. More than generous--some families would put him up for a week for a single coin.\"Half a doubloon a day,\" she said.\"No, you see, the idea behind bargaining is that you ask for a larger amount.\u201d\nDeclan has other reasons for being in the edge than just wooing Rose. He needs to find and destroy a doomsday machine his uncle is using in hopes of stealing magic.This was packed with the humor and action you expect from an Ilona Andrews novel. While it isn\u2019t as strong as some of the Kate Daniels series I definitely see the potential of the book in later series. It took awhile for the love interest to grow on me but in the end he was everything a hero should be. The world of the edge and the magic in it is interesting and different form their other series and I can\u2019t wait to see what will happen in William\u2019s story. This was a beautiful blend of action and romance."}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "*TRIGGER WARNING: THERE IS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT RAPE CULTURE IN THE COMMENT SECTION OF THIS REVIEW*DNF @ 70%I just can't be arsed.

Every time you re-read a book is like reading it for the first time. I loved this book and I remembered so little of it that it was like I was reading it for the first time.***********************************************Oh my god! I have to say a huge THANK YOU I.A.This book was awesome. I wanted more of it. Usually I'm anxious to see how a story ends but this time I just wanted it to keep going. I actually had happy tears in the end!!!Where should I begin? This book pushed all my buttons. The story, the characters, the world-building, everything was spectacular!Let's start by the protagonists.Rose...Rose is such a relatable heroine. She is easy to like and gives the \"girl-next-door\" vibe. Does she have remarkable characteristics? Well yes, but she isn't one of a kind. She has a strong flash(the strongest in the Edge) but this doesn't help when she needs to put food to the table for herself and for her two young brothers. She is a strong heroine but unlike most of UF and PNR heroines she is responsible because she has more than herself to think about. I liked her from prologue to epilogue.Declan...Declan is mysterious, sexy, full of surprises. Until the last page he keeps Rose on her toes. I really would have loved to have his POV but sadly it wasn't there, although the book was written from multiple POVs. I liked the fact that he wasn't spoiled rotten despite his family's status and his positiion. He was loyal and fierce and HOT.The whole deal between them was kind of fairytalish. He was the noble knight, she was the Cinderella(though she was no damsel-in-distress by any account), there were challenges to prove his determination to have her and... *sigh*. Words abandon me. The romance side of this book was just great and fullfilling without being sticky sweet.The side characters...Well, I loved them ALL. The boys, Jack and George, were so cute and adorable(and I want to adopt them), the grandmother was exactly how she should be(protective and loving), William...-*sigh again*- I loved William, I can't wait for his book. Even the \"bad\" people were well-written. Seriously there wasn't anyone that I thought shouldn't be there.The story and world building...The story was fast and full of action. What I love about I.A. books is that the romance is actually the side story and everything doesn't evolve around whether the heroes are going at it like bunnies or not. The world I.A. has built is actually quite fresh. Was it the first time we have seen a world built in different dimensions? Nope, but Andrews has added her magic and the world is original enough that you just want to know more. Also thankfully the \"rules\" of how it works were actually more easily understood than it was in Kate Daniels.So all in all if the book had any faults I just can't remember them and this is enough for me so I'm giving it a 5 wholeheartedly and already moving it to my favs self. *happy dance*"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "$2.99 Kindle sale as of Sept. 22, 2017. If you like Ilona Andrews' brand of romance-driven urban fantasy, grab this one! 4.5 stars. Rose and her two little brothers, George and Jack, ages 10 and 8, live in the Edge, a sort of halfway place between our world (which they call the Broken, since magic doesn't work there) and a parallel world called the Weird, where magical powers reign. In the Edge, magic works, but not as well as in the Weird. Most people can't pass through from one world to the other, or even sense that the other world exists, but there are exceptions, like Rose and her brothers. And Declan, the mysterious guy from the Weird who appears on Rose's doorstep, with magical powers even she can't match, and barges into their lives. Rose doesn't trust Declan an inch ... but she can't deny he's the hottest guy she's ever seen. And just maybe she'll be glad he's there, as deadly magical hounds begin appearing in the Edge and killing people. I read this urban fantasy for the second time last night, when I really should have been reading other books, but it totally sucked me in and I couldn't help it! Not just the power of Declan (who is awesome), but there's William the shapeshifter, and George (a necromancer), and Jack (another shapeshifter), and Mamere, their French-speaking grandmother...And how did I miss even giving it a star rating the first time I read it? But I liked it even better the second time. Full review to come (really!

I liked the distinctive voice I saw in that story, one that has stayed true in the subsequent stories that I have read by this team. With On the Edge, they have continued that excellence, providing me with a novel that is multi-faceted, genre-wise and story-wise. Although I grew up in the Midwest, my roots are Southern, and I do appreciate books set in the South that show the real ways of Southerners. In this case, I saw something very real and almost familiar in Rose, her brothers, grandmother, and friends and neighbors. I smiled when Rose threw the boys in the car and took them to Walmart. Yeah, that's real. Real people do shop there. How many times do you read a book where the characters go to Walmart to buy not the designer shoes, but the ones that look close enough to pass muster? How about a heroine who buys ground beef and adds rice and bread crumbs to stretch it? Yup, that's real alright. How about those moments when you have to stretch your paycheck and hope you have enough money left over the week to buy gas so you can get to work? I've definitely been there. And the love and ties of family, having to work hard all day and get home, take care of your family, go to bed, and get up and do it again. I think a lot of readers can identify with that. So what if Rose is magical, along with everyone in her family? That's a little more on the fantasy part of the scale. But this combination is why urban fantasy is so irresistible to me. The real and the surreal nicely entwined.The ideas in this story strike me as very unique and different. I liked it a lot, even if some elements was pretty odd, like a reanimated grandfather who likes to eat stray dogs' brains. Or the fact that a lot folks in the Edge community can curse people, or send flashes of powerful energy out of their bodies. And then there is the shapeshifting younger brother of Rose, Jack. The other young brother is a powerful necromancer (hence the zombie granddad). And things get even more interesting when Declan shows up. Rose's powerful flash abilities have made her an asset to Blueblood families who want to integrate her genes into their family lines, one way or the other. She has become wary of men for that reason, since most of her suitors didn't ask nicely. So when too good to be true Declan shows up to claim her and take her back to the Weird, the magical lands that are adjacent to the Edge, she definitely doesn't eagerly go off with him. She makes an oath with the handsome warrior that he can have her if he succeeds in her three challenges. However, they have big problems on their hands, as there are horrible, magical hounds that are devouring Edgers for their magic. And they really want to get their hands on Rose and her family.I loved Rose. She was a heroine that you could hang with, and that you'd be slightly in awe of, because she knows how to take care of business. She's the type that you tell to do something, and she takes about five minutes or more, and she's back and ready to get the job done. Not the heroine who is infallible and annoyingly perfect. Nope, she's the heroine that you love because she tries so hard, and she has the determination to do what is necessary. I loved Rose's commitment to her brothers, how she raised them from a young age after her mother lost her mind and her father ran off treasure-hunting. Jack and Georgie (her brothers) are adorable and genuine little boys, despite their very unusual abilities. They were sweeties and reminded me of the poem about what boys are made of (you know, snails and puppy dog tails). You could see why Rose loves them, even though being a single mom to her brothers is far from easy.Declan was a great match for Rose. He was just as determined and capable. He might be a rich princelike guy, but he was down to earth enough that this didn't bother me. And I do like tough, warrior heroes, I won't lie. He took to the kids very quickly, and he treated them like they were his own. He even makes pancakes for them. I liked how he was as much a thinker as a doer, a problem-solver not afraid to get his hands dirty. He was a guy who made a commitment and stood by his word, no matter what. Declan was definitely a knight in shining armor, and I could see why Rose fell in love with him.William was also adorable. I felt for him, and I will probably end up reading Bayou Moon soon to get more of him. I liked his wildness but also his goodness and how sweet he was with the kids (I am a sucker for that).On the Edge has its dark, gruesome elements, but I'm okay with that. I like some dark in my fantasy. I loved the juxtaposition of the everyday with the fantastic and surreal. The Andrews have a great way of writing descriptively and setting the scene without overdoing things and info-dumping. I like that the narrative is spare in some places, and the character sketches give you enough to get an idea of the folks in the story, but you can still learn more as you read. There are times you have to figure things out as you go, which is what I prefer, to be honest.Although I am sure this book wouldn't work for everyone, I had a ball reading it. I liked everything about it. The romance was great, but the fantasy elements were equally important. I'd recommend this to a reader who likes fantasy but wants to try romance, and a reader on the other side of that equation."}, {"userName": "Choko", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27962805-choko", "userReview": "*** 4.40 ***A buddy read with my friends at the Ilona Andrews AddictsI have come to realize that I take IA's writing for granted. It happens like that. You read enough works from a favorite author and you develop an expectation, a knowledge that once you delve into the pages of their books, nothing could possibly go wrong.It had been a while since I read a work by the Gordons and I had forgotten about the pure, natural immersion in the world of magic they allow their readers. You are 20% in and not once were you bogged down with info dumps or overwhelmed by surplus descriptions! Not once were you lectured on the world, or lost in a labyrinth of confusion of how this magical world works. You read a page and you just find yourself a part of the story, the world is part of your life, and the characters, family... Voala! Nothing to it, right? Well if this is so easy, why don't all authors do it??? Why do we spend time reading tons of volumes looking for that same ease and make excuses for works which show a fraction of the magic we take as a given in IA's writing??? Because they craft their art so seemingly effortlessly, that we forget to stand still for a bit and acknowledge their mastery of storytelling!!! There are many reviews which give a better view of the contents of this book and I don't want to get into it here. After all, there are many more books of theirs that I can be more specific with. At this moment I just want to stop, take deep breaths, and basque in the talent that are Ilona Andrews! And thank them, for giving us books to which we can return when we are in need of feeling like we are safely back home!

Does he make it right in the end? Yup. But some of the things said prior to then, I'm left wondering if they were part of the 'act' or just his real thoughts. I still dunno. I like Declan. I love Rose. And George and Jack are AMAZING. And I can't wait to read more about William.23 January 2015: $2.99 on KindleRe-read January 2015. I'm reminded once again, as if I needed it, why I love Ilona Andrews.So I should actually read my previous reviews before I cross-post. I need to add some stuff here.I did end up loving Declan, and I liked him immediately, but he pissed me off a LOT in the middle. (It makes sense in the end, but still...) All I can say is stick with him, and even if you don't love him by the end, I think you'll still be wanting to continue on - after all, future books contain different main characters.Rose's reaction to Declan was a little irritating, too. Instead of kicking his ass from here to kingdom come, she was a little too accepting. She does come around and do some ass-kicking, but I do wish it'd been sooner rather than later.But William. Nom nom. Must have more William (luckily his book is next).Ahh. And I just noticed that I first read this before the Kate Daniels series....that might explain quite a bit about my initial reaction actually.Original review cross-posted from here. Buddy read with my friends at IAA.The world here that Ilona Andrews created is a fascinating place. Not quite our world, not quite a fantasy world, it's vivid, captivating place filled with captivating characters. I was absolutely immersed in the Edge, and loved every moment that I spent there.Rose was a fascinating character. She's had the rose-colored glasses, pardon the pun, ripped off her face and expects the worst in everyone but family, whom she's fiercely loyal to. She's very stubborn and almost can't back down from a challenge. I admit I loved this about her. She was not about to let anyone run her life or take over for her. Rose wasn't about to give her trust to anyone that didn't deserve it, and she damn sure wasn't going to let just anyone have her heart.Declan, I absolutely loved from the first moment that Rose tried to run him over. He was arrogant and brash, and yet at the same time he's honorable, loyal and admirable. His interactions with Rose and her family made my heart tremble. I was rooting for him to find the way past Rose's defenses from the start.Beyond the utterly wonderful world, and vividness of Rose and Declan, there's a supporting cast of fully three-dimensional cast of secondary characters. Jack and Georgie, in particular, just hit my heart hard. I loved seeing through their point-of-views, feeling the heart-breaking burden of their gifts, the absolutely pure love they had for each other and Rose, and the disarming yearning they had for peace and happiness.The evil that threatens Rose and all those that live in the edge is cruel and vicious, with complicated connections. I did feel that the resolution of it was a bit rushed, but I was so involved in the character's journeys that it was only after I finished that I really thought about that.As a first time reader of Ms. Andrews, I was absolutely enchanted with the world-building, the characters, and the emotions in On the Edge. And I can't wait to go back and visit the world again with Bayou Moon which is already out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys Patricia Briggs and Jeaniene Frost. Ms. Andrews has a way of pulling you into the world, to the point where I was up late into the night just having to read 'one more' chapter."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "Dear God, please protect me from the wrath of the Ilona Andrews fans who might read this review.

I disliked them both. I get the motivation for why Rose acted like she did toward him, but that didn't make it any easier to read.It takes \"slow burn\" romance to another level entirely. Like glacial melt romance. I got to 64% and Rose STILL couldn't stand Declan and he was STILL a smug asshole.I did really like Georgie and Jack. I liked the magic, but you know, I really didn't like the Edge. It seemed like a shittier place to live than Bon Temps from the Sookie Stackhouse series (and THAT was a shithole).

It is fresh, with sweet and bitter flavours in the right proportions, guaranteed to make you feel hot despite all the ice. :)Hanging out on the Edge - a world between an ordinary and a magic world-was an undeniable romp. All the usual ingredients are presented, but served so well that you simply don't mind predictability, clich\u00e9s or the incomplete world-building. You just quaff it all and when you get to the bottom of your glass, you just want a refill right away.I loved Rose & Georgie & Jack (happy to see the \"connection\" to the Innkeeper Chronicles), but Declan was the highlight for me - he made it to my Literary Bae-shortlist. Yes, a stereotype & a commonplace figure, but I caaaaan't help myself! He is just so adorably and irresistably aristocratic(erotic-ratic) and aloof and yet you know that there is fire behind the ice (a definite Mr Darcy-vibe, if you ask me).

Ilona Andrews knows how to write female characters with strong personalities and snarky humor - a winning combination in my eyes.\nI love sarcastic girls!This story is about Rose. She lives in a place called the Edge, which is in a land that sits between the two main lands in this world. One is magical, called the Weird, and the other is non-magical and like our modern world, called the Broken. The Edge is in-between and the people have some magic. It's also like the back woods of Kentucky or something because these people are serious redneck hillbillies.\nthe Edge HiltonRose has more magic than the other hicks in her world, so she is a hot commodity. Everybody wants her because she can pop out some magical babies.\nShe's got special eggs...But, Rose has been burned before. She had a boyfriend whom she thought loved her, and he betrayed her by planning on kidnapping her and selling her off to the highest bidder. Worst. boyfriend. ever. So, this guy from Weird shows up and says he wants to marry her. She's slightly skeptical, and totally not interested. She has built quite a life for herself - raising her two brothers and working as a maid, while living in squalor in hillbillyville and barely able to afford food. Why would she want to leave all of that? So, she tells this guy, Declan, that he has to complete three tests to win her and she will leave with him. She has no plan to go anywhere with this guy, so she plans on making the tests harder than the bar exam. But, she still can appreciate a good-looking a-hole when she sees one.\nTrue, Declan was heartbreakingly beautiful and hypnotic to watch. But, she would have even more fun when she watched that muscled back and that perfect ass recede as he walked down the path away from her house, never to return.\n\nThis book is lots of fun and has many chuckle-worthy moments. Declan is definitely a good love-interest, and William is also interesting. I am looking forward to William's book."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016128-shannon", "userReview": "Honestly, this book probably has one of the most unique worlds I've come across in a long time. The character development is fantastic and the way the point of views shift really adds something to the overall story. I enjoyed this book a lot more than Magic Bites and I'm definitely going to continue with this series!Rose was stubborn and ornery most of the book but for once she's a character that has legitimate reasons. Declan is a fascinating character with more sides to him than first appear. Rose's two brothers, George and Jack, are probably the best children characters I've ever come across in a work of adult fiction. You get to see the world through their POV and it's really refreshing. I thought all the secondary characters were really great too, but the villain was kind of underdeveloped - I thought his minions were scarier.In a world where every paranormal romance book is about vampires, werewolves, or fairies, it's nice to read something that it so different. And this is definitely paranormal romance and way hotter than the Kate Daniels series.This was probably one of my favorite books I've read all year and I can't wait for the next installment!"}, {"userName": "Lisa Kay", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2459470-lisa-kay", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Carole (Carole's Random Life in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books", "userReview": "Buddy Read with the fabulous Ilona Andrews Addicts Group!Discussion ThreadThis review can also be found at Carole's Random Life.4 Stars!When a group of friends on Goodreads decided to read this book together, I knew that I had to join in on the fun. I am a huge fan of Ilona Andrews. I read this book a couple of years ago and enjoyed but but for some reason never picked up the rest of the books in the series. This seemed like a perfect opportunity to refresh my memory of this book and jump into the rest of the series. As I read this book, I could not help but think about the things that the writing team of Gordon and Ilona Andrews do consistently well so I thought I would touch on these things in this review: Excellent world buildingThe Edge is something completely different than I have ever read. In this world, there are three main divisions: the Broken, the Weird, and the Edge. The Broken would be our world-full of WalMarts, Burger Kings, and people who don't know about the existence of any other world. The Weird is a magical world with fewer people and less technology. The Edge is the point between the two worlds-magic and few people who self govern themselves. Tough main charactersRose is no damsel in distress. She doesn't expect anyone to take care of her or her brothers. She does what needs to be done without complaint. She helps out whenever she can despite the fact that others have tried to use her. I love the fact that Rose thinks fast under pressure and is incredibly tough. She doesn't look for a fight but she is not one to back away from one when necessary.Swoon worthy male leadsFirst things first-Declan is no Curran and he is no Mad Rogan. He is still a very good male lead. He doesn't hesitate to put himself in danger to protect Rose and her family and friends. Declan became more and more likable for me as the story progress and by the end of the story I was sold. Something about Declan early in the book seemed almost a bit cartoonish but the more I learned about him the more real he became.Excellent banterWhat would a Ilona Andrews book be without the trademark banter? The interactions between the two main characters is extraordinary. I love how they are able to work some humor into every story usually through the character dialog. Just the right amount of actionThis book has no shortage of action. The last part of the book is almost non-stop. There are also the quieter times where we get to really know the characters. By the end of the book, I knew how much the fight meant to everyone involved. The pacing of the book was excellent.I liked lots of other things in this book. Rose's brothers, Jack and Georgie, were amazing. These two kids were truly unique and amazing characters and ended up being one of the main strengths of the book. I loved that the characters in this book spent time doing such normal things. They went to Burger King and made several trips to WalMart. These are things that most people can relate to although most of us don't start riots because of our attractiveness at any of these locations. I would highly recommend this book to others. I do think that this book would appeal to fans of paranormal romance. The romance aspect seemed to be a much larger focus than in other Ilona Andrews works. I enjoy romance so that wasn't an issue for me but it may be for other readers. I can't wait to start on the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Liz* Fashionably Late", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8191214-liz-fashionably-late", "userReview": "IA knows how to do it so one should wonder, why is it that I haven't read this series yet?So, as a Kate Daniels fangirl, my brain was annoying me comparing the first books of both series (and just the first because nothing compares to KD awesomeness) and thinking:\u270e When it comes to world building, Kate Daniels wins the prize.\u270e But when it comes to characters and their dynamics, The Edge takes it home. Oh, come on, don't gasp. Curran/Kate is awesome in the next installments but can we talk a minute about the secondary characters in this book? AMAZING. Jack and George are one of the best children characters I've read in the genre. Jack specially with his \"knife, knife, knife\" scene. It really reminded me of:This one is solid. And yet, I can't give it five stars. I couldn't enjoy the relationship between Rose and Declan because he was with her under a false premise: to make little Declans D: so every time I read banter between them, my brain was screaming DANGER, damn it!Of course, IA was playing with me. Not only he wasn't a pervert but we learn he's the real deal. Ladies love him, wanna marry him...

Unfortunately On the Edge didn't win as much loyalty.Cue a unique magic world, which seems to the be the author's specialty - different areas of magic that shift if you leave them, and value measured by \"white light\" or something. It's a little confusing. Rose takes care of her younger brothers while fending off suitors over the years who wanted to kidnap her - and worse - when she revealed abilities. She's not pleased when a powerful blueblood shows up on her doorstep, determined to carry her off as her new wife.Writing style is of course great. There's humor, fun banter with dialogue, and the characters are basically likable. Rose took awhile to grow on me - while she has legit reasons to have a massive boulder on her shoulder trying my patience, it was annoying to deal with for awhile. Declan has some humor but he doesn't hold the playful, genuine alpha feel of Curran nor the magic of Rogan. Their relationship held spark but it wasn't something I was as invested in.The villain of the story was a creepy thing. Challenging and horror-filled monsters, and I was intrigued by the side players as much as the main characters.

Thankfully my lovely wife Sarah recommened I continue with the IA theme and read The Edge. I'm amazed at the ability of IA to create new and exciting worlds. This series is no exception and I fell in love with the edge from the start. It's a really weird place between worlds. On one side you have our world with it's distinct lack of magic (and called the Broken as a result) and on the other there's the Weird and believe me with all the crazy magic in it the name fits like a glove! The denizens of the Edge are hard people and it's every family on their own. The Draytons are one of those families and they have it harder than many others. Rose, the MC, works very hard to feed her brothers and on top of that has to fend off constant attacks because of a mistake she made as a teen. We were all teenagers once and we all have done remarkably stupid things in attempt to impress/rub the noses of our fellow classmates. Especially if those classmates were assholes. Despite having an awful existence Rose is a great person, a loving sister and granddaughter and a responsible neighbor. A bit on the paranoid side but that's only to be expected if people have repeatedly tried to kidnap you and sell you for a broodmare. So when a blueblood noble from the Weird showed up on her doorstep one day she was less than welcoming :D That scene was just perfect! I loved every word of it! At first Declan, the blueblood, struck me as a major jackass but the inconsistencies between his words and actions soon led me to believe that there's more to him than what appears on the surface. Soon I was rooting for him with all my heart and when he showed his true self I was overjoyed. I felt bad at times for all the burning hoops he had to jump through to get Rose to trust him but it was too entertaining to really pity him. That's what dedication looks like :)While I really liked both Rose and Declan, Jack and George, Rose's brothers were the ones who stole my heart. They're just so adorable, especially Jack. Brave and smart those two will be trouble once they grow up and I hope we'll have a chance to see more of them.This new world is rich and layered and there's still a hell of a lot to explore so I'm off to do just that."}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "This was very different from the Kate Daniels series. Different in a good way. I love Ilona Andrews\u2019 imaginative world building. The Edge is a world sandwiched between our world known as The Broken because no magic works and The Weird a place where the blueblood magical aristocrats live. The Weird is like a parallel universe to our world. The people that inhabit The Edge are an eccentric collection of characters with some magical powers. The Edge is not the safest place to live and in this story there are some sightings of strange creatures that eat people for their magic. Rose Drayton is struggling to support her two young brothers. She works \u201cunder the table\u201d at a cleaning company in The Broken. She scrimps and saves every penny to make ends meet so that her young brothers can have the food and the things they need. I really liked the cast of characters. It takes a special talent to write such believable characters. It\u2019s refreshing to see a strong female character. Rose is intelligent, brave, and a little too fearless. She is extremely protective of her brothers. Despite all of these characteristics, I loved watching her melt when Declan came into the picture.Declan was a fun character, a little reminiscent of Curran. His interactions with Rose reminded me of the ongoing sparring that we saw in the other series, although not quite so adversarial. I found Declan a touch too perfect, too strong, too handsome. But who\u2019s complaining? Declan was truly intrigued by Rose and managed to find a way to rent a room in her house, thereby getting to know her better. Once Rose finally trusted Declan, I loved how they worked as a team in their battle against the creatures. I loved the children Georgie and Jack. Georgie was able to raise the dead and Jack could shift into a lynx. One of my favorite scenes was written from Jack\u2019s perspective as he ran through the woods as a lynx.While this book doesn\u2019t feel like a romance, it does have that requisite happy ending. One of the best lines in this book and probably in any book I\u2019ve read lately is: \u201cGo brush your teeth, comb your hair, put on dry clothes, and get the guns.

The beginning is a little heavy on the world building details and backstory - and it took me a while to get used to the reader since I had just listened to another audio book and it's always jarring when switching over.

If you\u2019re looking for a strong female character, clever banter, and romance that builds to a slow burn, look no further. Their Kate Daniels series won me over as a fan, and this story only increased my love of their writing. Rose lives in the Edge, a world in between the Broken: our normal world, and the Weird: a world where magic dominates. She lives with her two younger brothers, having to take over the role of parent since her mother died and her father took off. Rose makes barely enough money in the Broken to care for their needs, and she struggles to keep her brothers behaving while trying to provide. Behaving takes special restraint when you have magic powers like Rose\u2019s little brothers do. Rose is also gifted magically, not that this has made much of a difference in her life so far, other than make her a target for unwanted advances. Enter Declan, an aristocrat from the Weird. He shows up demanding things of Rose and with his striking green eyes and looks that make any girl go weak in the knees he might be hard to refuse, but Rose is not about to lie down and take anything from him. Least of all his bossing around! But there\u2019s something in the Edge killing, and it seems Declan and Rose must work together to defeat the threat. This was such a strange and different story, in the very best way. The magic and world described felt like no other I\u2019ve read about. Granted, I haven\u2019t read very many Urban Fantasy novels but this was definitely unique to me, yet easy to grasp. One thing I\u2019ve noticed about Ilona Andrews\u2019 writing is that they do not mire their stories down with endless descriptions that make your eyes glaze over in boredom. Rather, they give you just enough to set the world up perfectly. This was the case with On the Edge.Another area where this story shines is in the smart and witty banter. Both Rose and Declan are strong characters so when they come together there is a wonderful push and pull between them that will have you cracking up: \n\u201cIf you touch me, I\u2019ll hit you with this chair,\u201d she ground out. \u201cI had no idea you enjoyed rough courtship,\u201d he said with a straight face. \u201cIt was never my particular favorite, but I\u2019ll do my best to play along, provided I\u2019ll get you in the end.\u201dRose opened her mouth, but nothing came out. \u201cWould you like me to be quiet?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIf you kiss me, I promise to be quiet for a very long time.\u201d\nMany exchanges like this had me laughing throughout the story. Rose is a wonderfully crafted heroine. There is no frustrating or stupid decision making, no whining that make you grit your teeth. Just a woman that works with what she has and tries to get by. This woman is not without defenses either, she has some pretty cool powers. There\u2019s also a sweet side to this story: Rose\u2019s relationship with her younger brothers. She was so caring always putting their needs ahead of her own. The boys as well as Rose\u2019s grandmother were well fleshed-out secondary characters that you grow to love. This is a first in a series but this story wraps up nicely, and the next one focuses on another secondary character. I have to say you really can\u2019t go wrong with Ilona Andrews. So far I\u2019ve loved everything they\u2019ve written.

I'm reminded once again, as if I needed it, why I love Ilona Andrews.Original review cross-posted from here. Buddy read with my friends at IAA.The world here that Ilona Andrews created is a fascinating place. Not quite our world, not quite a fantasy world, it's vivid, captivating place filled with captivating characters. I was absolutely immersed in the Edge, and loved every moment that I spent there.Rose was a fascinating character. She's had the rose-colored glasses, pardon the pun, ripped off her face and expects the worst in everyone but family, whom she's fiercely loyal to. She's very stubborn and almost can't back down from a challenge. I admit I loved this about her. She was not about to let anyone run her life or take over for her. Rose wasn't about to give her trust to anyone that didn't deserve it, and she damn sure wasn't going to let just anyone have her heart.Declan, I absolutely loved from the first moment that Rose tried to run him over. He was arrogant and brash, and yet at the same time he's honorable, loyal and admirable. His interactions with Rose and her family made my heart tremble. I was rooting for him to find the way past Rose's defenses from the start.Beyond the utterly wonderful world, and vividness of Rose and Declan, there's a supporting cast of fully three-dimensional cast of secondary characters. Jack and Georgie, in particular, just hit my heart hard. I loved seeing through their point-of-views, feeling the heart-breaking burden of their gifts, the absolutely pure love they had for each other and Rose, and the disarming yearning they had for peace and happiness.The evil that threatens Rose and all those that live in the edge is cruel and vicious, with complicated connections. I did feel that the resolution of it was a bit rushed, but I was so involved in the character's journeys that it was only after I finished that I really thought about that.As a first time reader of Ms. Andrews, I was absolutely enchanted with the world-building, the characters, and the emotions in On the Edge. And I can't wait to go back and visit the world again with Bayou Moon which is already out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys Patricia Briggs and Jeaniene Frost. Ms. Andrews has a way of pulling you into the world, to the point where I was up late into the night just having to read 'one more' chapter."}], "description": "Rose Drayton lives on the Edge, between the world of the Broken (where people drive cars, shop at Wal-Mart, and magic is a fairy tale) and the Weird (where blueblood aristocrats rule, changelings roam, and the strength of your magic can change your destiny).
