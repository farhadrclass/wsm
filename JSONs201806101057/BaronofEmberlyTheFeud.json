Share the love and vote for it here. I always look forward to a new Tamara Leigh medieval book! This is the second book in the series, it had been awhile since I read the first one, but didn't feel lost when I picked this one up. It's probably better to read them in order though. Lady Thomasin has accepted that she will wed her family enemy, Baron Mangus Verdun. I liked Thomasin quite a bit and Mangus as well. I really grew to love his character as the book progressed. I really liked them together, I also liked that their relationship was based on more than just looks. I liked that Thomasin was \"plain\" but because beautiful to Mangus. Her inner beauty really shown threw. Lots of swoony moments! There is a bit of a mystery that carries over from the first book, but thought it stood well on its own. Ms. Leigh always amazes me at how she is able to transport me to the medieval setting so effortlessly. I always get sucked in and have a hard time putting down her books. I look forward to the final book in the series, I have my suspicion on who the \"bad guy\" is and am dying to see if I am right! ContentRomance: Pretty clean, PG13.

All the machinations between the Baronies, the family dynamics, Mangus and Thomasin's worries, hearts and their sweet and troubled fall. It really was a dynamic, intense, packed read with many twists and turns. Mangus and Thomasin's hearts, both hurting, but hopeful, were so deeply written in the pages of this novel. Lovely, personable, troubled, hurting, hopeful, and beautiful how their two hearts came together to trust and to learn to love each other. This saga is a great read. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys period novels with all the family/political intrigue. Great twist at the end, and part of the mystery in the series unfolded."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26546888-april", "userReview": "Fans of Leigh's Age of Faith series will be held captive once again in her new series, The Feud; especially with Book 2, Baron of Emberly! I will admit to skimming back through Book 1 to refresh my memory. You will find it important to set right in your mind who is who and in which family, as well as each families part in the betrayal. While each story is a separate story with different main characters, the story is a continuing one in which all the characters will play a part either in the forefront or as secondary characters. This is a series that does need to be read in order.Baron of Emberly, swept me up and had me fully engaged throughout the whole book! Thomasin and Magnus are characters you can root for and ones that are well fleshed out. There were several themes woven into the book, but one that I want to mention is that of the importance of inner beauty and what is lasting. Leigh did a wonderful job of bringing this truth to light. She also had me on the edge of my seat at the end! Truly, a wonderful and exciting novel!I enjoyed every moment of this journey with these characters and cannot wait for the final book, Baron of Blackwood due out in 2016!"}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3919715-pat", "userReview": "I LOVED this book so much. After reading the first book of this series (Baron of Godsmere), I was prepared to NOT really like either Thomasina or Magnus and, thus, to not like this book as much as the first. So I was completely unprepared for how much I loved both of them. Great fully developed characters -- easy to relate to in their weaknesses and insecurities -- and for whom I was anxiously awaiting their HEA. This one is definitely a keeper and one I will surely read again. I hope to find updates on some further aspects of their lives in future releases of this series."}, {"userName": "Tamara Tilley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1383724-tamara-tilley", "userReview": "Two amazing series from author Tamara Leigh, THE AGE OF FAITH SERIES and THE FUED are absolutely incredible! I\u2019m not going to review the books individually, because I read both series so fast (nine books in all), I have too many stories buzzing around in my head; I would not do them the justice they deserve. Needless to say, it was an incredible journey filled with knights and ladies, castles and baronies, romance, intrigue, and tragedy.The true center of THE AGE OF FAITH SERIES is the Wulfrith family. Baron Wulfrith, Lady Beatrix, Lady Gaynor, Sir Abel, and Sir Everard, these are the main characters, and each has a book devoted to them. Everything about their stories captivated me, including the alluring covers. Currently, there are six books in this series, with the seventh to be released in Winter 2018. I can\u2019t wait!The FUED series tells the tale of three noblemen: the Baron of Godsmere, the Baron of Blackwood, and the Baron of Emberly, and their family feud that spans twenty-five years. The King wants an end to the feud, so he demands that the families inter-marry, creating bonds instead of rivals. Begrudgingly, the families follow the King\u2019s command, and the stories that unfold keep you turning page after page.My genre of preference is usually contemporary pieces. I\u2019m not one for Regency era, Amish, or fantasy, so I don\u2019t generally give period pieces my attention. However, a blogger I follow and respect, showcased books by Tamara Leigh, on more than one occasion, so I decided to give them a try. After reading, THE UNVEILING from THE AGE OF FAITH SERIES, and THE BARON OF GODSMERE from THE FUED SERIES, I was hooked, and immediately bought the other seven books that completed these two series. Each story transported me to a dark but magical era. Passion and pride, rivals and rogues, deception and dalliances. These series are escapism at its best! Exactly what I look for in a book. Thank you, Ms. Leigh, for an incredible journey."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58099820-nicole", "userReview": "Sword fights, ambushes, secret alliances, and a steamy (but clean) romance.

Loved the entire series!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20350483-sarah", "userReview": "I picked this book up for three reasons: 1) I love medieval fiction! 2) Who doesn\u2019t love a marriage of convenience story? 3) Tamara Leigh - enough said. I became a huge fan of Tamara\u2019s book after reading Lady At Arms a couple years ago, shortly after it released. I love her descriptions, attention to detail, writing style, and the way she brings the setting and characters to life. Basically, everything about her books! After reading the first book in this series, The Baron of Godsmere, I knew I would have to read the other two. There was pretty much no other option. I had to find out what would happen next! Plus, all three are a variation of a marriage of convenience, so I was hooked before ever reading the back cover description or having any knowledge of the storylines. Though this book is the second one, it actually stands alone quite well. There are a couple characters that carry over and comments that make more sense if you read the first, but it isn\u2019t a necessity. I always enjoy the relationships between her characters, as they learn to live together and discover what it truly means to become one. They are often strangers or borderline enemies when they first meet, so they must first learn to get along, and I enjoy getting to know them as they become acquainted with one another. This book definitely does not disappoint in this regard. Magnus and Thomasin both come to life within the pages of their story and I loved getting a glimpse into their lives! Both come into their marriage with wounds and fears. Thomasin fears not being enough and finding herself unwanted by her husband. Magnus also faces the fear of not being enough, or being considered weak, as well as the thought that he might not be able to protect his own. They were wonderfully flawed and I enjoyed watching them slowly learn to overcome their fears. Though they argue and don\u2019t get along at first, they bring out the best in each other and learn to put the other first. My only negative comment here is that Thomasin seemed rather childish at times, though to be fair, she is quite young and impulsive. I\u2019m sure it was intentional, but there were a couple times I would have shaken her, given the option. Tamara did an excellent job of making her realistic though, because I\u2019m honestly not certain given the situation, that I would\u2019ve reacted any better. I also really enjoyed the mystery and the suspense of trying to guess who the culprit was! The intrigue carries over from the first book, as they search out those determined to tear the families apart. A new enemy appears in this one and we\u2019re also left with a few undone threads to carry over into the final story, which releases sometime later this year. I am going to caution anyone who is unfamiliar with Tamara\u2019s books: she does portray Magnus and Thomasin\u2019s wedding night, though not in any great detail. And she is accurate with the time period, where marriage wasn\u2019t even considered by many. The main ones in her books do wait for marriage though, or else the importance of waiting is stressed. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t really recommend her books to younger readers. Overall opinion: I really enjoyed this book and devoured it within a few days of downloading it! I can\u2019t wait to read the next book and find out how what happens between the final baron and his lady (and of course, the mystery)!"}, {"userName": "Lis K", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27017317-lis-k", "userReview": "This is the second book in The Feud series. It can be read without having read book 1, Baron Of Godsmere, but I'd recommend reading that first to get the full picture of this long-standing feud. I wasn't sure how I'd like Thomasin as the heroine because she didn't really pique my interest in book 1. However, I loved her in this story. She is really strong, honest, and determined. Magnus was also a hero that you can really root for. He struggles witih something that I'd imagine would be difficult for a man in the medieval period. The mystery of the real villain becomes a little clearer in this book. I have a guess who it might be but I have to read book 3 to find out! Again, since this is an arranged marriage story, there is some issue with marital intimacies but still a clean read.
