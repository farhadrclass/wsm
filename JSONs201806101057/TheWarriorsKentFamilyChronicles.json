I reread this one in anticipation of finishing the series. I was reminded how these books truly bring our nation's history to a lifelike retelling. He has created great characters. Jeremiah Kent fights for the Rebels in the dying days of war and risks life and limb to get to the wife and daughter of his heroic colonel who has died only to endure the wrath of Sherman's army sweeping through Georgia. Michael Boyle, a Kent in all but name, flees the death and destruction of war after being wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness to work on the construction of the railroad across America only to further encounter battles of another kind. Gideon Kent after enduring years of torture in a prisoner of war camp and loss of an eye tries to find his way supporting his family by working on the railroads only to see his role as an organizer of labor, hated though he may be for that. And Jeptha Kent leaves the newspaper business to return to the pulpit. Louis Kent who sees himself as the rightful head of the Kent empire worms his way into any business deal that may add to his empire and more importantly to his power hungry ego, but he sides with men who are equally power grabbing maniacs.All of this is set in the last years of the Civil War and in the years afterwards when the nation was in utter turmoil. Jakes addresses all of that head on and also addresses the Erie Canal sandal, the building of the transcontinental railroad, the impeachment proceedings for President Johnson, etc. Loved it."}, {"userName": "Thom Swennes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3690472-thom-swennes", "userReview": "As the sixth volume of the Kent Family Chronicles, The Warriors doesn\u2019t lose any of the passion and action of the preceding five books. One of the great things about this series (in my opinion) is that it is difficult to say that one was so much superior to another. The books relate the times in which they were written and history unfolds in all of its glory. The Warriors is set in a continuation of the Civil War and its aftermath. The horrors inflicted upon the civilian population in Georgia and South Carolina by Sherman\u2019s infamous \u201cMarch to the Sea\u201d is vividly portrayed. As the United States licks its wounds and reconstruction begins, the movement west again gains momentum and the country grows once more with the Kent families playing a vital role. The seemingly impossible task of constructing a transcendental railroad is explored and serves as a tribute to immigrant Americans. The saga continues in a well written, interesting and colorful book. I have now re-read this book thirty years after my first read and have now given it another star. I can only attribute it to my age as that is the only thing that has changed in all those years as the book has stayed the same. Re-reads, especially after a long period of time often offer the reader another insight. I would still recommend this book (and in fact the whole series) to everyone that loves a great story and a gripping read."}, {"userName": "Brent Soderstrum", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1356105-brent-soderstrum", "userReview": "Volume 6 of the Kent Family Chronicles covers the end of the Civil War and those first few years after. So what's up with the Kent family?Jerimiah Kent brings a message to his deceased commanding officer's wife and helps her and her daughter prepare for the Union troops under Sherman to come through. He then heads west and becomes an outlaw with an Indian partner.Michale Kent Boyle helps lay track for the railroad. You get a glimpse of what it was like with the Indians and the traveling town that went with the group.No much from Mathew Kent. Artist in Paris.Gideon Kent is tortured as a prisoner of war and after the he helps develope a union to attempt to right the wrongs employees suffer.Louis Kent is running with the big financial dogs in an attempt to gain control of the Erie RR. He ends up hurt and Jephtha Kent regains control of Kentland. Good read. Not much time is covered. Hard to believe Jakes originally was going to take the Kent family from the Revolutionary War to the bi-centenial. He didn't quite make it by Volume 9. Maybe he will take it up again."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885029-bonnie", "userReview": "Shortly after I finished the fifth book in John Jakes' Bicentennial Series, The Warriors. This book focuses on Gideon Kent, a former Confederate soldier now struggling in the dangerous rail yards in New England, as well as honorary Kent family member Michael Boyle, worked on the transcontinental railroad. Gideon's younger brother Jeremiah also makes an auspicious appearance. Notably (or perhaps not *g*), this is the second Jakes book I will have to replace after reading it to the point of it literally falling apart.

The struggle's of the Kent family continue as the book meanders through American History in the late 1860's.We are now following more parts of the family tree in parallel and essentially running out of ideas and ideals."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136925-jennifer", "userReview": "Opening up with the battle of Chancellorsville, this novel picks up the Kent family as the Civil War is nearing its end. Jeptha\u2019s sons are fighting for the Confederacy \u2013 each their own way. Gideon has joined General Stuart\u2019s cavalry, Matt has joined a boat crew and is busy smuggling goods, and Jeremiah is busy trying to figure out how he can best serve his homeland. Meanwhile in New York City, Louis has married a woman from a very influential family and is busy expanding the Kent family assets. And Whatever happened to Michael Boyle after he was done following Amanda\u2019s decree to raise Louis? How will the end of the ware effect the remaining Kent family members? Will the two different sides ever reconcile?This, the 6th book in the Kent Family Chronicles covers a very bloody and dissident chapter in American history. This is a very well-researched novel and it does an incredible job at portraying the effects the war had on families. It is an interesting read in how it portrays the end of the war and what the various populations did after it had ended. This novel also covers the railroad race to the Pacific and the challenges it endured. Very well-written and developed; I would highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Bonnie Staughton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17067514-bonnie-staughton", "userReview": "Vol. 6 in the Kent Family Chronicles follows Jeremiah Kent at the end of the Civil War and life out West as a buffalo hunter with \"Kola\" his Sioux Indian friend. It follows Michael Kent Boyle as he works laying track for the push to get the railroad out West. It also follows Gideon Kent who sees the injustice in workers vs. management. Then there is Jephtha who is trying to restore the name of Kent and get the family artifacts away from Louis Kent.I love the family dynamic and seeing each generation of Kent develop. Though I realize this book is based during a very violent time in our country's history and I'm sure John Jakes's research is correct, I really didn't enjoy reading of all the bloodshed and the violence that man forces on his fellow men and women without any sense of guilt or shame. But I'm not doubting that this was on the mark. So many lives were wasted over men's greed, contempt for the Indians and no respect for women. But those were the times.I do enjoy this series by John Jakes and am hoping for a little less violence in book #7."}, {"userName": "Tanja", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12175578-tanja", "userReview": "This volume details the lives of Jephtha Kent\u2019s sons Gideon, Jeremiah and Matthew during and after the Civil War. We also meet again Michael Boyle, longtime friend of the northern Kents as he helps the Union Pacific Railroad advance their tracks toward the Pacific coast.

All books are narrated by Marc Vietor. The entire series is approximately 125 hours of listening. Shortest book is 15.5 hours, longest over 26 hours. Vietor does a good job with narration, although the uniqueness of male voices is problematic. Most significant, you\u2019ll have little difficulty determining who-says-what-to-who. Tempo and pacing fine, albeit the narration is a bit slow for my taste, bumped it to 1.25.The entire series is a broad spectrum history of the United States from just pre-Revolutionary War through the 1890s and a chronicle of the Kent family through this time. Beginning with Phillip through the generations to the children of Gideon, a great-great-grandson. Members of the clan fight in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, are at the Alamo, the California Gold Rush, the Great Chicago Fire, the Johnstown Flood, and much more. The author skillfully intersperses vignettes of imagined and factual history. For example, two of the fictional characters of the series are sheltered for a few days at the home of the Lincolns in rural Kentucky - a baby is part of the family, young Abraham. One of the fictional characters is counseled by Benjamin Franklin. Fiction, Phillip\u2019s childhood friend is Marquis deLafayette, non-fiction: deLafayette\u2019s role in United States and French military. The series is rife with this type of paradigm, but it is not difficult to determine what is true and what is fiction. All the instances that involve the Kents and John Jake\u2019s other fictional characters are products of his imagination. Much of the rest is a fun methodology of conveying historical events.The stories are very listenable. I found no need to re-wind or fast-forward; no segment boring or irrelevant. Theses books are not \u2018love stories\u2019 in the typical sense, albeit familial relationships, the crux of The Kent Family Chronicles, must include love stories, n'est-ce pas? In those areas where a sexual encounter is defined it is relevant to the plot and tastefully written. This does not occur often, but the clan does proliferate :-). A word to the prudish: there are a couple of rapes vividly described.Very typical of the time written, the 1970s, writing is a bit verbose. Several of these books were adapted for television mini-series, popular at the time.John Jakes is a terrific historical fiction author, recommended. Enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2888838-denise", "userReview": "Book #6 in the Kent Family Chronicles. It deals with the Civil War and exposes the death and destruction that war brings. I'm reading my way through this entire series. One thing I want to mention to potential readers is that these books were written right after the end of the Viet Nam war (mid 1970's). This was a period in American society when the U.S. (who lost the war and quickly vacated the country) was figuratively \"licking its wounds\". Thousands of young people had died during the Viet Nam war and the author repeatedly drives home the utter waste and brutality of war. He eviscerates the belief that war is ennobling and glorious. His characters mourn the fact that rational people didn't discuss the problems leading up to the Civil War and attempt to PREVENT a war at all costs (as they should do with ANY potential conflict). The \"flag waving\" evidenced in these books prior to the Civil War is indicative of the political rhetoric that Americans were exposed to prior to the Iraq invasion in 2003. Those in power who want war, who make a profit from war, will always advocate it as a necessary thing. Those who understand the destruction that war brings will always strive for peace and diplomacy. It's a profound message and I believe the author has done an excellent job weaving it into these books."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3125991-lynn", "userReview": "Book Six takes us into the thick of the Civil War and details what happened to Gideon and Jeremiah, the Kent brothers.

Half the books deals with the end of the Civil War, and the second half deals with the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, and the Erie Takeover scheme of 1868 by Jay Gould, and Jim Fisk.
