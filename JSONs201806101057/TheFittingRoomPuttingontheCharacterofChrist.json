It took me at least a month to get through it - that never happens. I had to go back and re-read chapters and really pray about the conviction weighing on my heart throughout this book. A-MAZING. I see it as a must read for everyone who strives to live out the virtues of Christ.

The book is based on Colossians 3:12 that says \"Therefore, as God\u2019s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience\". Kelly Minter uses the analogy of fashion as a way of relating how we wear the 'virtues'... but she is quick to point out that \"The Christian virtues are not something we can slap on ourselves like cutout paper dolls. They come as a result of heart change that is accomplished through the supernatural love of Jesus.\"I thought this was a great book, well written in a personal way. I could relate to much of what Kelly was sharing... because I have experienced it myself. She points out how our we become focused more on managing our behavior rather than promoting inward transformation. After the first few pages, I was hooked. When she says that we can never separate the qualities of God from God Himself, I felt the conviction. She talks of how we view godly character as something we can obtain if we just try harder. Oh... how often I've been there! The way we tell ourselves that we'll do better next time, be more patient, hold our tongue, or just use the virtues at will... as if it's something we can do on our own. So much to learn in this book... I think it could be used in a small group as well. Kelly Minter makes it easy to read and enjoyable as well. I think you'll enjoy it. *I received this book for free from The B&B Media Group for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Sunflower", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3078001-sunflower", "userReview": "\"The Fitting Room\" is a very down to earth, discussion, one may have with a close friend or at bible study about putting the \"character of Christ\" as we go through our daily lives.Short chapters, laidback style, engaging anecdotal stories and scripture, \"The Fitting Room\" talks about the clothing of our character that is shown in and through Jesus Christ.This is a book that discusses that, yes, life isn't going to be perfect, we're not going to be perfect, but Jesus Christ, through what He has done, is enough to clothed us in His image, not ours.It's about the realities that we're going to have our ups and downs, there's going to be days when our coffee orders may come out wrong or the washer and dryer decides to go out at the same time, but what \"The Fitting Room\" does is not only share stories and words of encouragment, but remind us that life isn't going to be perfect, but by following in our Father's footsteps, His grace is definitely sufficent for us.Written in a style that for the working mom, the busy stay at home and just the Christian sister who finds herself trying to balance everything, this isn't a book about impossibilties but a book about realities, that no matter what storms are in our lives, to encourage, strengthen and help us develop a strong character of compassion, strength and gentleness in and through Jesus Christ.Kelly Minter really hits the point what, sadly, many Christians, these days doesn't experience, when she shares in Chapter One, \"There are others who are all too aware of the characteristics of godliness but want nothing to do with them, because they were taught such virtues by people who didn\u2019t actually live by those principles. For them, the notion of godly character was flaunted by hypocrites, self-righteous leaders, or possibly angry parents, and they haven\u2019t wanted a piece of its polyester since. Yes, a lot of damage has been done in the name of God and Christian virtue; people have been clothed by reckless tailors. However, one of my greatest hopes is that if this has been your experience, you will give the discovery of authentic godliness another look, because biblical virtues are not punitive but life-giving.\"\"The Fitting Room\" goes straight to the heart of what having the character of Christ is about and doesn't promise, read this and overnight, but rather....is about having trust, faith, encouragement and even committment to allow Christ to work in and through us.This is a great book for those who may find themselves, disillusioned, harried or just plain exhausted and in need of not religion, but a relationship with Jesus Christ."}, {"userName": "Adrianne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4693950-adrianne", "userReview": "Great book for small groups! Kelly Minter does an excellent job of not just talking about the virtues listed in Colossians 3:12 but she also breaks down the entire verse from start to finish. What does it mean to be chosen, dearly loved, justified, and holy. She's witty and graceful in the way she writes...and most importantly it's full of truth. I would highly recommend this for small groups and even to read as an individual."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/978026-tim", "userReview": "I enjoy Minter's writing, even if this book seems to assume an entirely female audience and the self-deprecating humor became a bit overdone by the end. I picked it up as free e-book and was interested in how she would talk about Colossians 3. The book offers a solid exposition of the meaning of the various words the chapter contains and a challenge to put on that new self. Perhaps not enough church in the talk of discipleship, but good nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2557620-laura", "userReview": "As little girls, it\u2019s fun to play \u201cdress-up\u201d and with \u201cpaper dolls.\u201d As women, getting fitted for a prom dress, bridesmaid gown, or even a bridal gown. Kelly Minter, in her book, The Fitting Room, has provided a means for a spiritual makeover, one that lasts for eternity, by putting on the character of Christ.Kelly\u2019s book has a down-to-earth feel to it, but she\u2019s truly concerned about our spiritual growth. She feels like a friend sitting next to you and sharing spiritual truths while being transparent with her own walk with the Lord. She doesn\u2019t claim to have all the answers, but she has a way of getting her points across that are easy to understand and peppered with her wit.The power to walk this life is given by the Holy Spirit and God\u2019s holiness when by faith in Christ we are we are chosen by God. We are graciously chosen, loved by the Father, and called to live a holy life by putting off the old sinful nature.The specific virtues that Kelly discusses are the following: Forgiveness, part 1 and part 2\u2013The perfect storm; Yes, you really can Peace, part 1 and part 2\u2013Not as the world gives; A soul at rest Kindness\u2013And then came the rains Humility\u2013Everything must die (to rise again) Compassion\u2013When the crowds keep marching by Patience\u2013More than a disposition Joy\u2013The crowning virtueI was amazed at the wisdom set forth by Kelly in regards to these virtues. Yes, the wisdom comes from God, but He used Kelly to crack open the meanings in a very personal way. Again, she\u2019s very transparent with her own life, which makes the book that much more meaningful and encouraging.If you want to truly change and learn to put on the character of Christ, this is a great book to study. Kelly explains how to take off the negative traits and emotional entanglements we grew up with. But remember, it\u2019s a process, not a one-step rule and everything\u2019s fine. God will work in you to produce His character in you if you are open for change. Great for personal or group studies.The cover of her book will bring back memories of childhood paper dolls and getting fitted for a gown. Kelly\u2019s book goes deeper and is a necessary part of our lives.This book was provided by Karen Davis at The B & B Media Group, Inc., in exchange for my honest review.

Have you ever wondered what true beauty is? Tired of trying to meet the world's standards of beauty? When you look in the mirror what do you see?Come learn how God sees you and become the image bearer of the Great Designer. Be clothed in His glory and beauty. Become the woman you have always wanted to be - stunning, beautiful, breath-taking, lovely! Throw out that old wardrobe and exchange it for a heavenly one!Based on Colossians 2 Kelly Minter encourages readers to clothe themselves in Godly things. Her casual and authentic writing style makes the reader feel as if they are sitting with an old friend. I believe this book would be excellent for a small group bible study. All women struggle with some form of insecurity (though some hid it very well behind a mask of perfection). In the fourteen chapters of this book Kelly addresses the many lies of this world that have convinced us that we must look, dress, and act a certain way to be accepted. Kelly replaces those lies with the Word of God and teaches ladies that we to must clothe ourselves in God's Word.I highly recommend this book for all women.Thank you B&B Communications for this review copy."}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5719068-meghan", "userReview": "This is a portion of the comment I left on the {in}courage \"Bloom Book Club\" post wrapping up the series:This book appropriately and genuinely exalts Jesus.The last few chapters on humility, compassion, and patience have been all up in my grill. Is that the right phrase? ;) I needed the gentle reminder at the end of the book of the Truth that proceeded the list of virtues: that I am loved. And a great quote I came across tonight from C.S. Lewis encapsulates the life-long journey of taking off the old and putting on the new BECAUSE I am loved: \u201cThe Christian does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us.\u201d_____________I loved Kelly's down-to-earth, easy-to-talk-to style of writing. I know the areas in which I've been rightfully convicted by the Holy Spirit that need changing, but it says something about the book that I didn't walk away from it down-trodden or trying to strive to be better, but to let Him \"beautifully meddle\" with me because He loves me."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12518151-sharon", "userReview": "I absolutely adore Kelly Minter's writing style. She is down to earth and very real, and her use of written language is beautiful. The style alone makes this a pleasurable book to read. However, the content is what makes it excellent. She brings the practicality of living this Christian life into the real world. Knowing that we are chosen and made holy by Him establishes the foundation for clothing ourselves in the virtues of Christ. She then explores each attribute in detail and in a way that we can't wait to put it into practice. I love the real life stories and examples as well as her solid interpretation of Scripture. She is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors and Bible teachers!"}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30372157-deborah", "userReview": "This book really helped me deal with some issues as the holidays approached. Minter is easy to read and will make you smile even as she hits close to home on certain subjects. I think this would be a great book for a group discussion. I know there is one question posed in the discussion section that I would love to have group input on: \"What is the relationship between patience and mercy? In what ways are you lacking in mercy, and therefore in patience?\" Impatience is something I've been working on for years, so answering this question may be exactly what I need to make some progress. Whatever virtue you are most lacking--humility, kindness, joy, peace, patience, forgiveness or compassion, this little book will give you some ideas for trying on the character of Christ."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1373426-kathy", "userReview": "Kelly Minter has an enjoyable writing style. Her observation of life provides great insights from a fun and witty perspective. Each chapter takes on a character quality that we are to \"put on\" in our responses to life.

She said in one of her videos that she strives to write about things once she learns to live them herself, but not this time.
