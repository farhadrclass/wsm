With both narratives exploring marriage, husbands, children, and shining above all, their beloved work, one story is delivered leisurely in a single day, much like the contemplative Mrs. Dalloway; the other masterfully encompassing an entire life. Fascinating in structure and rich with detail, this is Naslund at her most delicately nuanced.Enjoy with me these lyrical sentences:-- Like dimly lit windows in the distance, ideas caught the edge of her attention for a moment, then winked out.-- Personifying Paris after the Revolution: The majestic city will glow and shudder around me, forgetting as best she can that blood and fear have swirled about her ankles.-- Regarding the fountain: Light, dressed in water, displayed itself as bright globules, as parallel lines and broken dashes, as continuous streamers, as spurts and gushes and splashes.And there's that gorgeous wedding night love scene! Oh my! And there are sentences full of wisdom:-- Yes, I am forever yoked to my husband, but this is the art of living: to feel what I feel; to be in no way repressed, mentally or emotionally; and to find the means both artistically and personally to let out the light that is within me. [Wow, what a powerful affirmation.]-- My father...used to say about his plays that the path to the universal was most certainly through the particular, but all great works, like a bridge, must place a foot on each shore, one concrete and one abstract.If you have time to linger over sentences, you will find much enjoyment in this novel."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15658922-katie", "userReview": "I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads.I vowed to finish this book even if it killed me.

The novel within the novel, historical fiction about Elisabeth Vigee Le Brun, is enjoyable. But its container novel is overly long and stuffed with too many characters, and the writing is so overwrought. \"Ahab's Wife\" is one of my favorite books, which heightened my disappointment."}, {"userName": "Colleen Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/651525-colleen-martin", "userReview": "This is proving to be a very difficult read, very self-aware and pretentious.

Unfortunately, as interesting as the concept may seem, my experience with it in real life haven\u2019t been very positive. The main problem I have is that I find myself only enjoying one of the stories being told while either being bored or not liking the other character\u2019s tale. This divide in interest and attention takes away from the overall enjoyment of the book. With The Fountain of St. James Court or, Portrait of the Artist as an Old Woman, I encountered this same problem, which made this book a big letdown for me.The book tells the stories of two strong female characters passionate about their works. The stories told switch from Katheryn Callaghan, an author, and French painter of portraits \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Le Brun. For myself, I found the story of \u00c9lisabeth to be more interesting of the two. I thought her story was more vibrant where I can really feel how her passion for painting was ignited as a child and progressed through the years to where she became one of the most recognized portrait painters of her time. It was interesting to see how \u00c9lisabeth\u2019s mind worked and the inspiration that went into her works. I just felt as if I got to know \u00c9lisabeth more thoroughly than I did with Katheryn. It was her narrative that I looked forward most to in the book.On the other hand, I am sorry to say that I was bored and a little confused with Katheryn\u2019s story. During \u00c9lisabeth\u2019s portion of the book, I got a sense that the story was moving and actually telling a period during her life, but with Katheryn I didn\u2019t know where her narrative was taking me. I felt her story was more of one big inner monologue about her thoughts and ideas mixed with her reflecting on her past (the method in which we learn about her and her past). Now it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if the tone of her story wasn\u2019t so flat. As I read through her parts of the book, I constantly found myself bored, wanting some spark from the narration to wake me up. Perhaps Naslund was going for a quiet and thoughtful tone with regards to Katheryn, but it didn\u2019t hold my attention like \u00c9lisabeth\u2019s story did.If both women\u2019s tale captivated me on equal levels or as close to it as can be, this book would\u2019ve worked for me. Like the last book I read involving telling the stories of two different women The Good Daughters by Joyce Maynard, the fact that only one story held my interest diminished the likeability of the book for me. The issue is further compounded by the monotonous tone of Katheryn\u2019s tale, making it difficult for me to get through her portions of the book. There were moments where I can see the comparisons being made between these two women in regards to their passion for their works and what obstacles they had to overcome to continue writing and painting. But other than that, I didn\u2019t see the need for the way the book is written. I just wished I could\u2019ve become invested in both characters instead of just one and I think that would\u2019ve made me the book more palatable to myself.*Received ARC edition from Goodreads First Read giveaway"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8367725-emily", "userReview": "Sena Jeter Naslund is a fantastic writer. She knows how to get into the soul of her characters so that her readers really connect with experiences and emotions. However, I was disappointed by this book. The pacing was tedious at times, and the plot seemed to drag. Points in the story that could have been engaging were instead brief mentions in a string of memories. Therein lies the fundamental problem with this book-- instead of feeling as though we are witnessing events in these women's lives, it feels as though we are being told a brief overview of important moments without being able to fully connect with them. It feels like you are sitting with an old woman, hearing her reminisce about her exciting life without being able to grasp the importance of the stories. I think a different format would have served the characters better.The sentences are beautifully crafted and there is some great imagery in the book, but at the end of the book it feels like nothing has happened. Marie Antoinette only briefly appears and although Vigee-Le Brun keeps saying that they had a strong connection, we never see it for ourselves and therefore we cannot entirely believe her. Vigee-Le Brun's life could have been portrayed as much more exciting and important than it was here."}, {"userName": "Julie Brickman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22202302-julie-brickman", "userReview": "The most amazing thing about this book to me was how it captured the way writers and artists relate to each other across geography and time. While on the surface, it seems as if the two novels woven together so astonishingly in this book are not related, they are deeply linked. Fountain, set in in contemporary times, features a writer, living in a neighborhood that surrounds a beautiful fountain, finishing a new book, still at the prime of her career while also growing older. Portrait follows a eighteenth century artist, who rose from humble origins to a great career as a painter, living through the tumultuous times of the French revolution. The relationship between these two geniuses, though not overt, crosses the boundaries of real time to show how profound are the ties that bloom between writers through their work. I also think Naslund can write sensory experience better than any living writer of our time."}, {"userName": "Leigh Kramer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7382729-leigh-kramer", "userReview": "I won't think of the French Revolution in the same way after reading this book. The past storyline, set in the years leading up the Revolution and then after, centers on a painter and her reflections on her life. The present storyline is about a writer who has just finished a novel about the French painter. They are both \"old\" women and it was interesting to have two main characters who frankly assessed the limits and benefits of their age. The book alternates these viewpoints, with the past storyline covering almost 80 years and the present storyline meandering over the course of a day. It was a bit jarring to go back and forth between such varied paces and the present day story did not hold my attention as well as a result. Still, Naslund is a gifted writer and quite a few of her sentences required reading again and pondering."}, {"userName": "J.

While the first chapters of this new book did not engage me as quickly as Ahab's Wife, I pressed on because of the power of Naslund's writing style.As a musician, writer, and novice painter, this book is a powerful read. Naslund has insights not only into the artistic processes of the painter, musician, and writer, she expresses depths of spirit that resonate deeply with my spiritual side. As an older woman, it was more difficult to read the stories of the aged women, and yet, here too she has important insights on the struggles and vulnerabilities one must face as one ages. Excellent read!"}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10773168-josh", "userReview": "You know how the high end TVs today have a feature where there is a \"picture within the picture\" so you can watch two channels at once? The one larger picture being the main show you have interest in, and another smaller one that you can keep an eye on but is a distraction of sorts to the larger show. In much that same way, this story functions. It's a little lop sided journey through two narratives of thought concerning two separate women with a strand of similar reflective remembrances on their lives' bodies of work. I won this book as a Goodreads first read, and while there were parts of the story that pinged my interest buds, as a whole it fell a little short of my personal tastes. Certainly in fairness to the author, the writing is well done; for some readers I am quite sure the perspectives and themes of self discovery will ring more true.The more interesting profile is that of the revolutionary era French portrait painter \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun. Her story weaves through a relationship as painter for and friend to Mary Antoinette, an escape from the society of change afoot in the French Revolution, a life of wandering that eventually returns to the French countryside after the essential destruction of the society in which she was a part of before she fled. There are also introspective notions that tell her story as she might have reflected upon it late in life.The second, and less interesting tale from my perspective is that of an author who has just completed a rough draft for her novel outlining the details of the first woman's tale. This artist is a modern day author who lives in the non-fictional Victorian inspired St. James Court section of Louisville, KY. Her tale is more a memoir style story that interjects yet another set of late in life observations, thought tangents, and reflections. There are also seemingly out of placed storylines involving the interactions with family and friends who make up the life influences of the author. I think the approach here was to attempt to parallel these experiences with that of the first leading lady, but I think it took away from the more interesting story. The feminine voice in both stories is certainly strong; not a complaint, but I do think more direct identity will be found by readers who might have experienced the hurts, joys, and loves shared by both these female characters. So, for me it is a 2 star experience, for others it will be a much higher rated read as the author does a good job writing what will appeal to some more than others."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2604014-carol", "userReview": "This book, The Fountain of St. James Court; or, Portrait of the Artist as an Old Woman: A Novel, by Sena Jeter Naslund, I discovered this was not your everyday biography. I was drawn to the book because of my appreciation of the artist, \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e-LeBrun, who was an excellent painter and was fortunate to have painted portraits of Marie Antoinette & family. Naslund has chosen to write in a similiar style like James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, (which I have yet to read). I'm grateful that the chapters are short.The modern story of the protagonist is intertwined with a character from the past whose own story also unfolds for readers to compare and contrast with the modern one. Readers are given the opportunity to follow 70 year old \"modern\" Kathryn, a writer, as she lives through an entire day after having completed a novel. Elizabeth's story is based on her entire life. Both Elizabeth and Kathryn have similar situations. * Both have only one child; Kathryn, a son and Elizabeth, a daughter. * Both characters have a close relationships with their mothers. Kathryn's mother is with her most of her life, while Elizabeth travels Europe to escape the revolution and is forced to leave her mother behind. * Marriage: Kathryn is three times divorced and Elizabeth is married only once. * When writing about Kathryn, or the \"Fountain\" chapters, readers also get some narration from some of Kathryn's friends and acquaintances. Elizabeth, from the \"Portrait\" chapters, is the only narrator in her story. I find myself reading only LeBrun's story because I find Kathryn's story a bit slow and lacking for me. I should have taken out \"Elisabeth Vigee LeBrun: the odyssey of an Artist\" by Gita May."}, {"userName": "Jacqie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2133111-jacqie", "userReview": "If this book had just been about the French female artist who lived during the time of the French Revolution, I most likely would have finished the whole thing. Her story, which discussed the artistic need to create, the nurturing of a talent, and a sense of vocation, was quite interesting. However, the second portrait (perhaps a self-portrait of the author, who also teaches writing and lives in Kentucky?) was a plot-less character study. It moved very slowly. There's one chapter where the character just lies in bed, musing over her past. Nothing wrong with some inner monologue, but while our historic character moved forward months and years, our present day character went hour by hour. While I think that the voice of women characters, especially older women characters, is not nearly as well represented in literature as it should be, I got bored and frustrated with this one. She seemed to dwell an awful lot upon either her failed marriage or her new romantic relationship. I would have liked to have heard more about how she saw herself as an artist, not as a wife/lover. Maybe I'll go back and just read the French chapters. Then I might finish at least that story."}, {"userName": "Sarah Holz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4836817-sarah-holz", "userReview": "Ugh, this kills me because Ahab's Wife is easily one of my favorite books ever, literally. But this just pales in comparison. The Elizabeth portions are told with such a light touch by the character itself that I felt like all I did was skim over the waters of her life without truly feeling the depths. The Ryn portions arguably have more depth, but her story is arguably less interesting also. I appreciate the Mrs. Dalloway approach of her story, though I feel like Naslund should have just committed and made nothing spectacular happen with the day; the confrontation that wraps up her story felt tacked on and unnecessary. And I know it sounds incredibly pedantic, but there is a reference to Bernini's very famous sculpture of Apollo chasing the nymph Daphne that claims that the female subject is the goddess Diana. I'm sure it'll get fixed in a later printing, but for a novel so much about art, it's a rather surprising mistake that is all the more glaring since it is put in the mouth of Elizabeth Vigee-Le Brun."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3294297-bethany", "userReview": "Terribly overwritten and under-edited.

Yes, Louisville friends, that is the real fountain at St. James Court on the cover. What I really enjoyed most about the book was the current day setting although it was tedious reading since it covered just one day. Having grown up in Louisville and attended the University of Louisville, this part of Old Louisville was like going home for me. Many, many times as students, my husband and I walked through St. James Court and Belgravia court admiring the homes and playing \"One day...\" Dr. Naslund mentioned Central Park and the tennis courts which is where my oldest brother played in many city-wide tennis tournaments. Dr. Naslund was a young professor at Louisville in the English Dept and although I never had her for a class, I remember seeing her whenever I was heading to classes. However, I thought that following the main character, Kathryn Callaghan, for one day made for tedious reading at times. It took almost two pages for her to walk up the steps in her home!!! I wanted to know more about the neighbors who seemed like nice characters.The story of Elizabeth Vigee-Le Brun, a French court portrait artist, made for better reading. She was a Her life was covered over years so much detail was left out but you got to know her better. She was a friend to Marie Antoinette and she somehow escaped the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. She was also a devoted mother to her only child. On a side note here, the NYC Metropolitan Museum of Art is exhibiting Elizabeth's works and since we are now close to NYC, I look forward to seeing the exhibit. The notice of this exhibit showed up on my Facebook feed one day after I started reading the book. I have to wonder about the Facebook/Goodreads connection and the algorithms used!!! LOL!! All in all, it was a good read, especially reading and knowing the section of Louisville that was used. I'm not sure I will read another book by Dr. Naslund, but I will pass this one on to my nephew's girlfriend who also lives in Old Louisville.Go Cards!

Conan Doyle (Sherlock in Love). Now she gives a nod to James Joyce and Virginia Woolf in The Fountain at St. James, or The Portrait of An Artist as an Old Woman.There are two female protagonists in Fountain, one imaginary and the other real. Kathryn Callaghan is a 21st century novelist who has just completed the first draft of a biographical novel. The subject of that novel is famed 18th century portraitist Elisabeth Vigee-Le Brun, who painted highly acclaimed works of Marie Antoinette and her courtiers. Kathryn's story takes place within a single day, as she takes stock of her life, now that she's in her sixties and contemplating how best to spend her final years. In doing so, she learns something about how far she will go to protect those she loves. Interspersed with Kathryn's experience is a reading of her new novel, told in the first person by the artist herself.Of the two lives presented here, Vigee-Le Brun's is by far the most momentous. As she dares to become the most pre-eminent female painter of her time, Elisabeth tells about her childhood with a much-loved father, her relationship with the Queen of France, and her flight from the horrors of the French Revolution. Along the way, she will lose the person she most loves, her daughter Julie. But to my mind, Kathryn's story is the more compelling one, as she comes to terms with love, loss, and age, and finds the courage to ward off a very real threat to the life of her own beloved son. While Elisabeth thinks of her life in visual, artistic terms, Kathryn relates hers to literature and its themes. But both spend considerable energy reflecting on the relationships that defined their work, their lives, and the choices that each made. As a novel, Fountain is deeply contemplative rather than action-based, and as a result, lags in many places. Still, the novel-within-a novel structure is interesting, and as always, Ms. Naslund's writing is eloquent and evocative."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4030732-donna", "userReview": "At some points in the story, I found myself enjoying it, but at others I found it nearly unbearable. There are far too many tedious and unneeded details in the story of Ryn particularly. How is a chronicle of a woman walking around her neighborhood and her house all day interesting enough to keep a story going? It isn't. And the way other characters (like a neighbor moving in or a little girl who lost her father) are barely introduced but then short segments are written from their perspective - I get frustrated again just writing this. There is a constant promise that some of these characters are going to be important in the story or have some impact. Don't be fooled, they don't.The story of Elizabeth was better, but the same details of her life are repeated multiple times in many cases and near the end the story isn't chronological, and there are confusing details about her life too, that just go nowhere.In a few places the writing is beautiful and I get the feeling that Naslund was trying to make some point about women growing old, but I didn't quite get it.

We see her lying in bed, sitting on the commode, daydreaming about her 3 ex-husbands. It reminded me of Mrs. Dalloway, probably because Naslund kept mentioning Mrs. Dalloway, which, by the way, I hated.Maybe one day I will read just the chapters about the artist from Marie Antoinette's court.
