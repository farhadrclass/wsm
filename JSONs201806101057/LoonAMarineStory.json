Most of it seems in a voice rather detached and stilted, from decades later than the events. And that aspect and affect dropped my interest considerably by the half way point of this book. Still, it is a very easy read, although I found that I could not linger in the Loon stand. Being of that era and prime year for nearly every male of my age that I knew to be drafted, I found some of his judgments and conclusions about who went and how they went by the drafting process completely off. In fact, I do not think it was a war fought by just the lower classes of American males at all. Now, with the volunteer army it is actually far more so a lower economic class input. Lower educational input, as well. Where I was many, many higher class or solidly middle class guys went. Did they school for awhile to think about it? Sure, they did. But did they go to Canada or have someone pay a draft board? No. They heard JFK's voice about giving back, not asking- for one thing. But beyond all that, this author was so young and is not any longer. And the letters are great but the rest is just a gloss and jump report. He has buried much of the prime thoughts and feelings I would have liked to find more of in this book. Except about Sid- and I find that a clue to how really deep he has buried the rest. His battle copy, assignment location and unit is excellent. His was a service much more toward the first than the last of this War. Yet his homecoming chapter read like a newspaper article, very detached. The soldiers coming home a couple of years later were treated far worse than just the neglect to acknowledgment or expressed appreciation or parade or handshake that he mentions. Traumatized men were spit on and called names in the airports in CA every single day. One of my friends became a type of greeter to become a barrier to this. Vietnam was a mistake built on idealism rah-rah. Today's idealism going the opposite way is worse and will lead to worse. Peace comes out of showing strength, not demonstrating apology and weakness. Human nature is pragmatic and will quickly fill any voids of power- both physical and economic."}, {"userName": "Eric_W", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w", "userReview": "A disappointing purchase and way over-priced.One of the really positive benefits of the self-publishing revolution has been the number of memoirs being published. Obviously many not polished, but interesting and of considerable historical value. Some are very good, indeed. Others less so. This one felt like a book one expects to have been self published; I looked, and was surprised to see the Random House imprint.Mclean, who was at Andover with George Bush, (of National Guard and cocaine fame,) struggled through Andover and when he wasn\u2019t accepted by Harvard or Yale, or Stanford, was at a loss as to what to do. So he enlisted in the Marines. He was born just a month before me, so the dates brought back many memories. Getting out of Parris Island, he was sent to California for a few months to learn supply, much to his relief, but everyone in the Marines eventually wound up in Vietnam, and, sure enough, his orders for that quagmire came through.Mclean was urged to write this memoir when his wife discovered the letters he had written home over the months he was in Vietnam. The very short section, barely a couple chapters, dealing with the horrific, if futile, experience on LZ Loon, was seemingly thrown in almost as an afterthought, rather than the highpoint (or low-) of his experience, his life even. Clearly the experience of writing for him personally must have been necessary and cathartic, I hope. There is a good story in here and perhaps with a good editor, it could have been teased out. It lacked focus and at times wandered between being critical and stand-up-salute-your-flag bravado. Finding a theme was difficult. There are many other Vietnam memoirs out there that I feel are much better. And I got a little tired of hearing that Sid was dead six weeks, two days, several weeks, later. Once has devastating impact. By the fourth time, it brought a yawn."}, {"userName": "Scott Whitmore", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8239695-scott-whitmore", "userReview": "Having finished Loon: A Marine Story by Jack McLean just a few hours ago, I was frankly at a loss as to how to start this review. Adjectives such as \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201csublime\u201d are accurate enough, and yet somehow do not convey the depth of my enjoyment and admiration for this memoir of a young man who left a life of comfort and privilege to enlist in the United States Marine Corps at a time when combat duty in Vietnam was all but certain.Finally, I decided to rely on my own years in uniform and go with what was always the topmost ranking a Sailor could achieve in any endeavor or performance review: Outstanding. Loon is simply outstanding.Jack McLean had a picture-perfect, upper-middle-class American childhood and adolescence. Born in the earliest wave of the post-WWII baby boom, he lived in the suburbs of New York City, learned to swim at the Y and had a paper route. McLean followed his father by attending prep school at Phillips Academy, with future President George W. Bush as a fellow student. But McLean struggled at Phillips and five years later when graduation finally came into sight he found colleges less than interested in him. That was fair, though, as he found himself less than interested in attending college right away. There was more to that decision than simply taking time off from school. There would be two issues that I would have to face should I decide not to go to college. The year was 1966. There was a draft. If you were eighteen or older, male, and of sound body and mind, it was your duty\u2014indeed it was the law\u2014to serve the country in the military for a minimum of two years. Second, there were my parents. I was certain that their vision for me included college\u2014any college.\u2014 Mclean, Jack (2009-05-07). Loon: A Marine Story (pp. 15-16). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.With engaging and fluid prose, McLean brings the reader along step-for-step on his journey to becoming a Marine, from enlisting through basic training at the famed Marine Corps Recruit Depot at Parris Island and then on to Vietnam where he survived a bitter three-day fight with the North Vietnamese Army at Landing Zone (LZ) Loon. Throughout the narrative the author provides historical context for background, such as the fact he was manning the perimeter at LZ Loon the same day Bobby Kennedy was shot in Los Angeles:Robert F. Kennedy was forty-two years old. He died the following morning, on June 6, 1968. Those of us in Charlie Company who survived LZ Loon would not hear the news for another week.Many of us died that day as well.\u2014 Mclean, Jack (2009-05-07). Loon: A Marine Story (p. 2). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.Mere weeks after surviving the fight at Loon, McLean is on an airplane for home, his tour of duty complete. Just months after Loon, McLean began his freshman year at Harvard, in the process becoming the first Vietnam veteran to attend that prestigious school. Loon isn\u2019t a military history of a battle; the details of the three-day fight at LZ Loon are vivid but somewhat unspecific \u2014 this reader suspects out of respect for the fallen. Instead, it is the story of how one boy became a Marine, and what that meant to him and about him. McLean\u2019s journey started differently than the other men he served with in Charlie Company, but each man passed the same tests along the path to becoming a Marine and in doing so they became brothers. One year after my graduation from Parris Island, I was in Vietnam, fighting side by side with my marine brothers, when I was shot at with live ammo for the first time. During the ensuing battle and the others that followed, I was confused, disoriented, and scared to death\u2014every time\u2014but I was never alone. There was always another marine nearby. He also was confused, disoriented, scared to death\u2014but he had me nearby. That was the way it worked in the Marine Corps. Together we\u2019d figure something out. \u2014 Mclean, Jack (2009-05-07). Loon: A Marine Story (p. 59). Random House Publishing Group.

I have seen a lot of war movies and read a lot of war books...Loon ranks up there with the very best.In 1967, Jack McLean enlisted in the Marines right out of a prestigious prep school rather than go to college. The book is about the path he took at the height of the Vietnam War which took him into combat as an infantryman. McLean is an articulate and perceptive writer (having later attended Harvard) and spins a great memoir. He captures the essence (and dissonance) of what the war was like \"at the pointy end of the spear,\" where so few of us have been. All of us can read about war as history-- McLean and his Marine brothers lived war. Casualties were not just nameless faces, they were his best friend Sid, or Tom, the ultra-cool guy that everybody wanted to be like, or so many members of his tight-knit group. The rest of us will never be able to comprehend that special, peculiar bond between combat veterans...He made me feel guilty about my missions flown from the relative safety of my air-conditioned cockpit, though that was not his point.If you are not interested in gritty details of life in the foxhole, don't read this.

It is a uniquely American story--from the privileged Baby Boomer adolescence through elite prep school, with station wagons and \"Leave it to Beaver\"--right up to the moment McLean opts to enlist in the Marine Corps. There he finds moral dilemmas and the \"cooperate and graduate\" socialization of Basic Training, as well as the trepidation/certainty about the future that arrived with graduating from Parris Island in the mid-60s. I liked the way the author interwove the events affecting the war from around the world (most notably Khe Sanh and LBJ's announcement that he wouldn't run in '68) into the narrative to show how circumstances outside his immediate perspective were influencing his experience at LZ Loon. The reader is treated to the standard features of this commonly-shared bildungsroman--the R&R to Singapore, the almost-tangible divide between himself and the college students he grew up with, and the culture shock (akin to getting off the bus at Basic) of leaving an air-conditioned 707 for the breath-sucking heat of Saigon; and that's good, because these facets are just about universal in Viet Nam narratives and we need to be reminded of that. What differentiates McLean's treatment of the topic, however, is his listing the names and circumstances of everyone in his Company killed at Loon, as well as his effort to describe the solid leadership his commanders provided to those besieged there. My only gripe about this book is the dearth of maps, but that's also a standard complaint I have lately. On the whole, I found \"Loon\" to be a good account and definitely a credit to the memory of the brothers-in-arms that Mr. McLean lost. I am also very pleased that books like this one and Karl Marlantes's recent works are now available to the generation that fought in Iraq and Afghanistan; we need them."}, {"userName": "Steve Woods", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3688618-steve-woods", "userReview": "This is a very straightforward memoir by an infantry corporal. There are no histrionics but it has none the less impact for that, it's honesty carries it. The man was no doubt a matter of fact soldier who knew his craft and simply got on with it like so many I knew. There is no crying in the beer but reading between the lines, his tour of duty cost him as it did almost anyone who saw combat there. I did not serve in the area of the country where he saw his service though having spent time in those mountains some thirty years later my hat is off to the Marines who did. It is truly hard country and they were always contending with the NVA who were never slouches in the endeavor of soldiering hard. They were no doubt the best light infantry in the world at the time. Their length of service and depth of experience gave them that.This is a book I would be happy to give to teenagers to impart to them what those not much older than they lived through in service to their country. The Marines in I Corp particularly. It leaves much to the imagination but it's not hard to get the message.

McLean published this memoir in 2009, about his experiences as a U.S. Marine during the Vietnam War (1966-69). He says that he leaned heavily on letters he'd written home for a lot of the narrative--which makes sense, since he's writing 40 years after the events he describes. But there is so much he glosses over; while he marvels at the horror and terror and grief he experienced, and even gives some gory detail, he also seems oddly detached from the experience. Some of that can be chalked up to the passage of time--this all happened a long time ago--but he also plainly states that he buried this shit as deep as he could when he returned to civilian life, and he's not about to dredge it up now. Some can also be chalked up to the fact that McLean is not a writer--the writing is a bit stiff and stilted--and he never professes to be. But I do wish the memoir could seem to have been more cathartic, more therapeutic for him. (Who knows, maybe it was. But it doesn't sound like it was.)

It's a pretty typical memoir, told from the eyes of Jack McLean who was the first Vietnam veteran to attend Harvard after serving in Vietnam. It's a very well written book. It doesn't dwell on anything too long and does a great job of mixing informative back-story with compelling firsthand narrative. Many times, memoirs get bogged down in one area of the author's history that he really wants to explore, and consequentially the entirety of his reading audience is forced to explore it with him. Not so with Loon. McLean gives us enough of his backstory (before signing up with the Marines) to help us understand who he is and why he would leave a comfortable New England society to serve in an unpopular war, but he does so with a deft touch.

It describes his background, training and pivots around the battle for LZ Loon (1968)where two companies fought a much larger force."}, {"userName": "Keith Raffel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4785562-keith-raffel", "userReview": "Written by a college classmate of mine (whom I didn't know in college and still don't). While the rest of us freshmen were finishing up our last two years of high school, the author was in the US Marines. While we worried about SAT scores and the prom, he was concerned with dead and wounded comrades in arms. An eye-opener for sure."}], "description": "\u201cKids like me didn\u2019t go to Vietnam,\u201d writes Jack McLean in his compulsively readable memoir. Raised in suburban New Jersey, he attended the Phillips Academy in Andover, MA, but decided to put college on hold. After graduation in the spring of 1966, faced with the mandatory military draft, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps for a two-year stint. \u201cVietnam at the time was a country, and not yet a war,\u201d he writes. It didn\u2019t remain that way for long.A year later, after boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, and stateside duty in Barstow, California, the Vietnam War was reaching its peak. McLean, like most available Marines, was retrained at Camp Pendleton, California, and sent to Vietnam as a grunt to serve in an infantry company in the northernmost reaches of South Vietnam. McLean\u2019s story climaxes with the horrific three-day Battle for Landing Zone Loon in June, 1968. Fought on a remote hill in the northwestern corner of South Vietnam, McLean bore witness to the horror of war and was forever changed. He returned home six weeks later to a country largely ambivalent to his service.Written with honesty and insight, Loon is a powerful coming-of-age portrait of a boy who bears witness to some of the most tumultuous events in our history, both in Vietnam and back home.", "title": "Loon: A Marine Story", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5624896-loon", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320541596l/5624896.jpg", "reviews": 41, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1041009.Jack_McLean", "name": "Jack McLean"}], "type": ["War", "War", "History", "Biography", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5624896-loon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8449823-loon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8468266-loon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6371238-the-compendium-of-nosh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126990-loon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9447805-glasgow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21116299-hopeless-but-not-serious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4498635-hopeless-not-serious"]}
