I must.I\u2019ve read them all so when his latest came out, I was like a kid counting out spare change on the counter of the beer store for a six pack of Milwaukee\u2019s Best. I needed to read.But I got this way for a reason \u2013 Moore can write, and his is an imagination that is twisted just right, like a Hunter S. Thompson goldilocks figuring out which pillbox of Mexican jumping beans holds just the RIGHT bean.Moore\u2019s latest, Secondhand Souls, is a gem - a return to his haunts in San Francisco and the motley crew from his 2006 novel A Dirty Job, which is hands down one of his best (behind Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.)Readers find our old friends Minty Fresh, Inspector Rivera and Lily and the gang uncovering more paranormal hijinks and supernatural ins, outs and what have yous. Moore, despite his penchant for profanity, irreverence and lowbrow humor is an erudite practitioner and his prose is crisp and moves along well. Fantasy readers will also enjoy his inclusion of occult and mythological elements as well as a more than passing knowledge of eastern philosophy.Good fun from a writer who knows all about writing entertaining books."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "I'm not feeling a long review for this audiobook, but I do feel that I should say something , so here it goes:1. Fisher Stevens is an  excellent  narrator and this audio performance is no exception. He did all the voices so well and with such gusto-I love this guy.2. Christopher Moore is hilarious. Sometimes juvenile, but that's okay with me. With characters like Minty Fresh and Lemon Fresh and phrases like \"Shy Dookie\" (that was a pet name for someone who could only poop at home), how can you not succumb to laughter, even if it is a bit silly?This audio book was a lot of fun and I recommend it to fans of this kind of humor!"}, {"userName": "Gail Strickland", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663981-gail-strickland", "userReview": "Since I became a widow five years ago, death has been no laughing matter...unless I'm reading Christopher Moore's take on it and then I snicker, giggle, laugh out loud and snort once or twice.

As the story opens Charlie Asher - enemy of the forces of darkness who was killed in the last book - now inhabits a makeshift foot-high body made of mismatched animal parts and luncheon meats. Charlie and the other 'Death Merchants' of San Francisco, whose job is to collect souls from the dying and pass them on to new bodies, have been shirking their responsibilities. Thus there are thousands of loose souls in the city, a situation that opens a door to the Underworld and allows weird and murderous creatures to come through. These deadly creatures include a banshee - who warns of trouble and swipes a stun gun; the Morrigan - a trio of women demons who eat souls to become solid; and Lemon Fresh - an Underworld honcho who favors yellow suits and a yellow car. The Underworld eruption means that Charlie and his family/friends must once again fight wicked forces that threaten to destroy the world. The first order of business is to get Charlie a human body, which turns out to be Mike Sullivan - a well-built, nice-looking fellow whose job is to paint the Golden Gate Bridge. For various reasons Mike was planning to jump off the bridge anyway....so why not? Other members of Charlie's team include a Buddhist nun, a retired cop, a crisis-center counselor, a homeless man, a book store owner, and others. Also on hand is Charlie's seven year old potty-mouthed daughter Sophie (who happens to be the 'Great Death' who can kill with a word) and Sophie's two goggies (enormous black hellhounds). Sophie and the 'aunties' and 'grannies' who take care of her are some of the funniest characters in the story. Other entertaining characters are ghosts at the Golden Gate Bridge who have stories to tell and the 'squirrel people' (made of animal parts) that live under the Buddhist center. All kinds of kooky (and sometimes deadly) occurrences eventually lead to the story's climax, where Charlie's team goes head to head with the Underworld creatures. Though the story is a sequel it can be read as a standalone. I thought the book was fun and entertaining and I'd highly recommend it to readers who who like off-beat humor and out-of-the-box characters.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."}, {"userName": " ZeN", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4545052-zen", "userReview": "Temper expectations and Secondhand Souls then becomes a great second half to the Grim Reaper saga. This novel feels as if A Dirty job was Vol. 1 of a two part story. Secondhand Souls serves as that concluding Vol. 2. It pays off on all the unanswered questions from the first book. The transition between books is seamless. Its is also consistent in narrative tone, humor and the characters spirit.

I would be fine with the latter revelation if there had been more time devoted to it (and there is a hint for it early on).

Hell, even bring in Anubis to yell at Audrey for fucking up the cycle in the first place because she\u2019s doing what she thinks is \u201cbest\u201d for the souls of the recently or nearly deceased.

A lot of things have changed since the battle with The Morrigan.

Minty Fresh, while dealing with a broken heart as a result from dating sarcastic goth Lily seems to be the only one not letting personal issues get in the way of duty and thats a big problem. Souls are not being collected and the forces of darkness are once again making their move on the streets of San Francisco. Breaking the rules in the Big Book of Death once again, the gang band together to set things right.I loved A Dirty Job and was excited to see a sequel to a book I thought would remain a stand alone. As usual Christopher Moore\u2019s writing is filled with heart and laughter but I was left somewhat disappointed. I was so happy to find what had become of the gang and spend time with those characters again but it felt kinda lazy to have the baddies the same as the first novel. I think it would have been much more interesting to have read of them battling a whole different kind of evil. I strongly suggest that anyone who hasn\u2019t read A Dirty Job do so before reading this one. Half the fun comes from knowing the history of these characters and seeing where they\u2019ve ended up, not to mention the fact that almost every aspect ties into things we\u2019ve learned about in the first.3.5/5*Thank you William Morrow and Edelweiss for this review copy*"}, {"userName": "Bob Milne", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2224905-bob-milne", "userReview": "Falling somewhere between offbeat/quirky and silly/juvenile, Secondhand Souls was actually a much more enjoyable read than I anticipated. Clearly I've missed something by diving into the second book of a series, butChristopher Moore recaps previous events well (and often . . . a tad too often), so I don't really feel like I've missed anything.What you have here is a world where people are 'chosen' to become Grim Reapers - yes, plural Grim Reapers, because it really is too big a job for one person. Charlie was a recipient of theBig Book of the Dead last around, had the recommended kitty calendar, carried around a #2 pencil, and ultimately sacrificed himself to stop a Celtic banshee from destroying San Francisco. Or, at least that's what the world believes. In reality, his Buddist nun girlfriend saved him from that fate, cobbling together a new body out of lunch meat and animal parts - a 14 inch body, with a 10 inch penis. Yup, and we're just getting started. There's also a seven-year-old daughter, who used to be princess of the Underworld, but whose powers have deserted her along with the hellhounds who protected her.Suffice to say, since his replacement couldn't be bothered to actually collect any of the souls that came so conveniently penciled in on his kitty calendar, it falls to Charlie to save the world. Fortunately, he's not alone - aiding him in this insanity are the aforementioned horny Buddist nun and profanity-charged daughter, along with a tiny crocodile wizard, a gang of Squirrel People, a retired cop, a bridge painter, the weirdly eccentric Emperor of San Francisco, and a Goth girl turned inappropriate suicide hotline counselor . . . whose best line for getting a guy not to jump is to offer him a blowjob.The plot itself is pretty basic, with your requisite dark powers trying to take over the world, but it's really secondary to the characters and the comedy. To be honest, I think we were halfway through the story before the villain even stepped onto the stage. It's a book that bordered on tedious or repetitive at times, but the frantic swing between satire and slapsitck, not to mention irreverence and (political) incorrectness, keeps you on your toes. Secondhand Soulsis a book that certainly owes a debt to Pratchett and Gaiman, but which seems tailored more for a Hangover or Neighbors generation. Funny, funny stuff, with scenes that will stick with you long after you forget what it was really about.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins\nDisclaimer: I received a complimentary ARC of this title from the publisher in exchange for review consideration.

This is that. The latest installment of Moore's Grim Reaper series gave me an awesome amount of pleasure, as my favorite San Francisco Death Merchants reappear (along with their entourage) and gird their loins to take on another menace to humanity. Everyone plays a part, and there are naughty hi-jinks galore. Yes, Moore has a delightfully prurient mind, and no doubt would rattle the morality code; wouldn't be surprised if his publisher has warned him to tone it down (or would they?). Moore is basically the horny fifteen-year-old jester who sat in the back of class in junior high and lets his wry yet funny witticisms delight sniggering classmates and frustrate humorless teachers (who secretly enjoy them even if they can't show it). He just hasn't grown up, and we the readers are beneficiaries of his humor. We're not talking Shakespeare or Cormac McCarthy, no. But we are expecting a fun frolic, and would have to say this is one of his better efforts, as I chortled at something on just about every page. Loved the characters, from the regular crew to the Squirrel People. There also was a completeness to this volume, although I hope that doesn't mean he will end this story line (as he usually does these in threes, though I wouldn't mind him tacking on new volumes to his other mini-series). He is one of a handful of writers I find myself recommending to friends and acquaintances the most. The only sad thing about finishing this book is that now I have to go back into a holding pattern for about a year for the next one (unless he is well along on a new book---we can only hope)."}, {"userName": "\u2728Susan\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21276121-susan", "userReview": "Christopher Moore is a nut, he has such a twisted story telling ability that it is like a train wreck, you just can't not watch/read.

But this literally read like a bad Christopher Moore fan-fiction written by a team of stoned college sophomores.I laughed at the patented Moore-isms. I thought the dynamic duo of Mrs. Ling and Mrs. Korchev was deployed to excellent comedic effect. I was mildly intrigued at the plot link back to Coyote Blue. I was impressed at the breadth of dong jokes. It was nice to see Abby Normal and Lilly in action together. I guess it was better than not having a new Christopher Moore book to read... actually that's not true. I would definitely have preferred this one didn't exist than that I felt compelled to read it. Other than that there's nothing much positive to say.What the hell happened here? A Dirty Job was already seriously reaching for a coherent set of rules to hold together it's fantasy world plot.

I'm not sure if my favorite part was from her interaction with the drag nuns, or telling a strange man that she named the pony she was coloring Sparkle Darkle Glitter-tits just to get a reaction. There was also a bit much fun with Wiggly Charlie, the affection name for Squirrel People Charlie, the poor over-compensated meat bag holding human Charlie's soul. The rest of the cast was great support, but I'm really hoping this is followed up with teenage Sophie threatening to sic the \"goggies\" on everyone if she doesn't get chocolate and a date with a cute boy, or heaven forbid, \"kitty\" anyone fool enough to challenge her at the wrong time."}, {"userName": "MightyA", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41147845-mightya", "userReview": "Christopher Moore's novels are additive.

My guess is that Christopher Moore signed a deal for a follow-up to A Dirty Job, time was up, so he knocked this out. I wasn't impressed. I laughed/cried/snorted my way through A Dirty Job. Seriously. I may have chuckled once or twice this go 'round. Charlie's new body was funny at the end of the first book but once it's sustained for a while and some obvious drawbacks are pointed out, it just got disturbing. Like, I-wish-I-could-scrub-this-image-from-my-mind disturbing. And, yes, thank you, I do actually have an overdeveloped sense of potty humor. But too far is actually too far.The characters were just kind of more of the same. That should be good since I loved them before, but everybody changes at least a little bit over a year or so. Not these characters. The bad guy(s) are back. Well, there's a different, surprising, leader but the rest is the same. I think we got all the laughs we could out of beating these villains up the first time. I miss Mrs. Ling and Mrs. Korchev. They got a scene or two and they were amusing but that was it. There was a lot more of Lily this time around, and she was funny. Abby Normal shows up for a couple of pages in a throwaway scene. I could go on, but I guess I'll sum this up with \"Same characters, only slightly different story.\"The ghosts on the bridge confused me. I was probably jet-lagged while I read this, so maybe I just missed it. But they tell these long stories, some funny, some sad, some just random, for no apparent reason. Padding the page count? I don't know. I saw absolutely no purpose.Somehow, A Dirty Job was funny and crass in a way that I liked but it still had heart. Charlie was doing his best despite being overwhelmingly unprepared for the job. The Emperor is trying to save his city. Death is more than a punchline, and hospice workers are angels on earth. I found that all to be missing now.I have loved Christopher Moore in the past, and luckily I still have quite a few books from his back catalog left to read, because I think I may be done with him now. I haven't really enjoyed any of his work since 2007. Wow. Except for Bite Me. I do love Abby Normal. As I write this, the average rating on GoodReads is almost 4.0, so I'm obviously in the minority, but there you go. This one just wasn't for me. Christopher Moore fans will obviously read it.

But Moore made me laugh, and that's good. His stuff is weird and, let's be frank, skates along the fine edge of just plain stupid, but, when he hits his stride, he's really funny. Frankly, I've always thought his finest hour was the heretical, irreverent Lamb, but he's at his best (to my mind) when he's combining the supernatural with the just plain silly, demonstrating that nothing, absolutely nothing, is off limits. And one of the joys that Moore offers derives from his willingness to recycle his characters and mix and match his mini-series/genres (most recently transitioning from vampires to soul collectors/death merchants). Literature - this is not! Thought-provoking, not so much. But, if, for example, you find John Scalzi's Red Shirts too buttoned up, or if you liked reading Dav Pilkey's Captain Underpants to your kids (or whether you read it in the bookstore for personal pleasure when no one was looking), you're probably the target audience for this kind of, um, low brow, off beat, pretty much \"out there\" entertainment. You won't find this on your child's high school or college reading list any time soon, but 350 pages of fast-paced escapist entertainment, innumerable chuckles, and at least a dozen burst-out belly laughs is well worth my time.

The characters we love are back, in different places in their lives (and even in different bodies), but still themselves. Plus, there are some memorable new characters, including a Golden Gate Bridge painter named Mike, a mysterious man dressed all in yellow, and a banshee, among others. San Francisco itself is a star, and seeing such a crazy adventure unfold in our beloved city is at least half the fun.Who am I kidding? It's all fun. The logic of the story gets a little thin at times, but it doesn't really matter. If you're a Christopher Moore fan, you need to read this.

No one can do paranormal comedy like Moore.

Secondhand Souls is of course the sequel to A Dirty Job, which introduced us to Charlie, beta male junk shop owner, and the hidden world of the Death Merchants. (Also: a devastatingly cool record-shop owner called Minty Fresh, a toddler who may-or-may-not be Death and her pet Hellhounds, Lily the PerkyGoth, Audrey the Buddhist nun, The Emperor of San Francisco, The Morrigan and The Squirrel People, among others.) Read that before you read this, or you'll be really lost. In fact, you probably are already.With the whole bizarre gang back in play -- plus some new additions -- Secondhand Souls is not a mere cheesey sequel (though cheez plays a critical role); it's more like visiting with batshit crazy old friends. Unfortunately for them it turns out, due in large part to the events in A Dirty Job, there's a dangerous backlog of uncollected souls lurking around San Francisco, and Charlie and friends are once again embroiled in the danger and magical maneuvering that is dealing with the powers of darkness rising. Fortunately, they are more than weird enough to handle the crisis. I don't want to spoil the plot, so I'll just say it's hilarious.Maybe I love these books because they capture San Francisco's magic in ways that ring true in my heart. It's like an idealized version of my hometown -- in the topography of Moore's books I basically live across the street from Minty's shop, and nobody ever has to step over homeless people sleeping in the vestibule. Crazy people are really helpful geniuses, and even normal folks can afford the rents. (I find all this somehow reassuring, as magic is in short supply around here these days.) Also, the characters have more fun talking to each other than anybody ever has had in the history of ever. (Except maybe \"The Gilmore Girls.\") For nutty-but-somehow-deep dialogue, you really can't beat Christopher Moore. 5 whole-hearted, sunny-yet-deeply-morbid stars."}, {"userName": "Meigan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13576703-meigan", "userReview": "Things are decidedly odd around the city of San Francisco. Well, things always are in Moore's version of it, so perhaps that should be odder. Or more odd, whatever works. Souls are disappearing and the Merchants are experiencing trouble retrieving the ones showing up in their notebooks. Add to that, the Luminatus has lost powers and the the hellhounds have disappeared. Everything is pointing to trouble, but trouble from where is anyone's guess. The sewers have been quiet, the Morr\u00edgan have crawled back in the woodwork. Charlie knows something is off, and that something has apocalyptic proportions. If only he weren't a 14\" Squirrel Person with a 10\" wang. Because a giant wang can really slow someone down :)A Dirty Job, the first book in Moore's reaper series, ended on a satisfactory note; everything was nicely wrapped, minus the bow, so I had no clue how Moore would continue the story of Charlie and his motley crew. And while I adored that book to pieces -- a combination of Moore's bizzaro and hilarious storytelling and the fantastic performance by Fisher Stevens in the audiobook, Secondhand Souls is just as wonderfully weird as the first, even with such a large gap in time between installments. What makes this series stand out to me is the flawless blend of humor and incredibly unique characters, all centered around a storyline involving soul collecting and the various Death Merchants inhabiting the city. Add to that, a delightfully idiotic band of villains pulled straight from Celtic mythology and folklore. The Morr\u00edgan -- Babd, Macha, and Nemain -- now have a new leader who's nothing like the predecessor. As the new leader would say, \"Orcus ain't shit.\" And I kind of have to agree with him, Orcus indeed ain't shit. Christopher Moore has become a favorite of mine, even though I've only read two of his books. Two, you say? Yes, but I've started my own Moore collection in both print and digital. Because Moore is an author I will read...and read again...and read some more just for good measure. Not to mention, several important characters are introduced in other works of Moore, and I'm super excited to see them in a different capacity, especially Minty Fresh and the Emperor. Bottom line -- do yourself a favor and read this series. Start with A Dirty Job and savor every word before moving on to this book. And if you get a chance, do yourself another super big giant favor and also get the audiobooks. Fisher Stevens is phenomenal and adds so much depth and hilarity to an already incredibly fun and funny series. I dare you to listen in public and not laugh like a hyena. Go ahead, I'll wait :)"}], "description": "In San Francisco, the souls of the dead are mysteriously disappearing\u2014and you know that can't be good\u2014in New York Times bestselling author Christopher Moore's delightfully funny sequel to A Dirty Job.Something really strange is happening in the City by the Bay.
