Indeed, two characters bear the surnames of Hawthorne and James.This is my introduction to the work of Peter Straub. Having read The Talisman and Black House which he co-authored with Stephen King I was anxious to know how he writes on his own, and Ghost Story came recommended by virtually everyone who has read it. As mentioned in the first paragraph, Ghost Story is a homage to the old masters who paved the road of fright for future generations. Peter Straub himself says that \"[Ghost Story] started as a result of my having just read all the American supernatural fiction I could find\". It is noticeable; the first part is largely a reworking of The Turn of The Screw. The theme of a story within a story is everpresent, as the work deals with a group of old men who tell themselves ghost stories on regular meetings. Shades of Lovecraft, Poe and Hawthorne brood in the corners of the rooms they sit in.The men find themselves terrorized by terrible, realistic nightmares. Terrible things start happening in the small, sleepy town of Millburn.They remember the crime they had committed years before...and wonder if the time of retribution has finally arrived.What's not to like? Several things. first of all, the pace: the book is monstrous slog. A chore to get through. Straub switches between several narrative viewpoints (much like Stoker in Dracula) and the plot plods frequently and slows down so much that reading soon becomes a challenge. There's no doubt that Straub is a great writer - some of his passages I've read several times, because I simply enjoyed them so much - but he becomes lost in what he tries to do, the references he includes so subtly vanish in the detail he describes so voraciously.The protagonists discuss ghost stories they tell to each other, but for some reason refuse to talk about the one they all share even when darkness has fallen upon their city. Instead of trying to scheme how to fight or at least delay the danger, they remain passive. No one fights back. No one things of moving away and running from the deadly force. The passivity, the stupidness of their actions drastically slows down the plot and kills any tension that might have emerged. It would be understandable if the novel featured only one protagonist who witnessed these events and who would be afraid to entrust his story to others (in fear of being considered insane) - but Ghost Story features a group of men who believe each other, and do nothing.The theme of a town besieged by malevolent forces or beings has been done previously, most notably by Peter Straub's fellow writer and friend Stephen King in Salem's Lot. Straub acknowledges the influcence: \"I wanted to work on a large canvas. 'Salem's Lot showed me how to do this without getting lost among a lot of minor characters. Besides the large canvas, I also wanted a certain largeness of effect.\"However, while Salem's Lot was swift, fast-paced and competent in dealing with the theme, Ghost Story doesn't quite deliver. The town of Millburn is described as a small town, but it completely lacks any awareness and interaction. The characters seem to be detached from reality - everyone walks everywhere, and there's little mention of pop culture - music, television and such. The novel is supposed to take time in the 1970s, but for all we are shown it might just as well be the 1870s.Last, the Evil with a capital E. While the concept of the Evil is really interesting, the Evil is really inconsistent and incompetent. There's no sense of looming presence of Evil, ready to fall upon the heads of innocent people and end their lives at any moment, like in Salem's Lot or Phantoms. Evil seems to be employed when it is needed by the narrative, and then pushed back, only to be called again later. I don't want to spoil anything, but the nature of the Evil and it's actions don't follow any pattern of logic and reason. Evil is at times omniscient and capable of incredible power, only to have its abilities reduced to humanlike status, and then go back to the supernatural and all-powerful again. Evil capable of everything is boring - why, it'd take a snap of fingers to eliminate a human being, much like a child breaking a twig in two - but one might wonder why the author chose to grant his menace that priviledge, only to take it back...and then allow it to be all poweful again, several times.Overall, I'm sad to say that Ghost Story doesn't live up to the hype that surrrounds it. While it is a complex, multilayered work, a homage to the creators of the genre, It's not very compelling and in fact is pretty easy to put down and leave unfinished. The concept, the idea of the novel - the premise, the prose, the situations - everything works, but not as a whole. I think I like the idea of the book better than the book itself - Peter Straub tends to be meandering and repetitive. There are sections of Ghost Story that are narrated brilliantly, but there are sections that are stale and uninteresting. For each flash of suspense and atmosphere, there's a whole lot of mundane and ordinary. The idea of the novel deserves five stars, but I can't give the novel itself more than three - I liked it, but I liked analysing the text more than reading it. Nevertheless, Peter Straub is an ambitious writer who's much more \"literary\" than most horror authors - his prose and style easily rivals the so-called \"serious\" writers - and I most certainly will read his other novels."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "A few words i found by Stephen King about this novel \"Probably Ghost Story by Peter Straub is the best of the supernatural novels to be published in the wake of the three books that kicked off a new horror \"wave\" in the seventies\u2014those three, of course, being Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Other. The fact that these three books, all published within five years of each other, enjoyed such wide popularity, helped to convince (or reconvince) publishers that horror fiction had a commercial potential much wider than the readership of such defunct magazines as Weird Tales and Unknown or the paperback reissues of Arkham House books.* \u201dThis was a real haunting good read, the story drives you crazy in places with characters perceptions of reality being played with by the supernatural.This is my first Straub novel and he writes a plot well and makes you feel you are there amidst the snow filled town slowly falling apart day by day.The story paces well and does not let down, the tale was reminiscent of Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury.The review is @ more2read also with a video2watch interview with Peter Straub."}, {"userName": "Dirk Grobbelaar", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3102740-dirk-grobbelaar", "userReview": "An intelligent and ambitious novel, Ghost Story has received some well deserved acclaim. That is, however, not enough. Not even close. This is a book that should be re-introduced to a whole new generation of readers. It really is that good. Stephen King himself lists it as one of the best horror novels of the 20th century (refer Danse Macabre).I will not go into plot details at this stage, since these can be had by reading the book synopsis. Instead, in general terms, I'll try and explain just why this book should be on the reading list of any self respecting horror fan.First of all, this is not a novel that offers up cheap thrills and quick scares. The terror, sometimes expected, often unexpected, is measured out in precise and exact quantities. Lovingly so. Mister Straub has managed to weave into Ghost Story an absolutely breathless sense of inevitability and futility. It still remains one of the most atmospheric dark tales I\u2019ve read.Secondly, it is a pretty complicated story: dense and epic. It\u2019s a story about terrible things that happen to people and the secret lives people lead. The cast is also fairly big. Think you know what's going on around here? Think again.Lastly, Peter Straub is arguably one of the best wordsmiths out there. He can write.Comparisons with Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot' are inevitable: the small town setting; the terror that comes to town. I read the two novels almost back to back and will be hard pressed to pick a personal favourite, although the \u201cantagonist\u201d in Straub\u2019s book is much more complicated. In both novels, a great amount of time is spent on creating breathing, flesh and blood, characters. This, of course, makes the terror more palpable when it comes. And does it come!Often subtle, the Horror element takes on interesting shapes in Mister Straub's capable hands. Things aren't quite what they seem, and isn't it marvellous? Looking for a thrilling read that will ever so slowly freeze your blood without attempting to shock with gratuitous gore and schlock tactics? Then line up, Dr Rabbitfoot has your medicine right here!"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "BAIT AND SWITCH. \n\"Peter Straub's classic bestseller is a work of \"superb horror\" (The Washington Post Book World) that, like any good ghost story, stands the test of time -- and conjures our darkest fears and nightmares.\"\nOh, this book was conjuring my worst fears alright...

The week we arrived in Alabama (Mobile area) Hurricane Opal decided to make landfall. Most of our stuff was still on the back of my brother-in-law's flatbed trailer. The most important items lost (for me, at least) was my mother's book collection. Whilst in California, Mom called her master bedroom's walk-in The Great Book Closet. This grand space was stocked with more than 450 first editions of some of the best horror literature ever written. These books were gifts from friends, family, and co-workers, but mostly they came from one person in particular\u2014my mother's best friend Andrita. Sadly, all the books Andrita ever bought my mother were lost to water damage. Not only was my mother 2,000 miles away from her lifelong friend but she'd also lost most of the collection Andrita helped her build. 22 books survived, but Ghost Story was not one of them. Freakishly enough, I would lose those final 22 books another 9 years later when Hurricane Ivan came through Montgomery, Alabama and flooded my storage shed. To date, I have replaced all 450 books (my mother kept record of all her gifts and purchases, and I've been working off the contents in her ledger for the past ten years) aside from three. With Jessica's gift, I only need to replace two more. Thank you so much, Jessica. So there's your E. History Lesson of the Day. After receiving Jessica's gift, I decided to reread Ghost Story so that I might give it a proper review. Here is that review:For this reread I chose the audiobook narrated by Buck Schirner. All too often, literary horror is read in a cheesy, over-the-top fashion. These narrators seemingly want to be Vincent Price, but only Price could pull of Price without sounding like a bit of rejected B-movie voiceover. Buck Schirner is damn good at what he does. His performance is highly recommended. If you dig earhole stimuli, stimulate your earholes with this audiobook. Now for the book itself. Ghost Story is one of the greatest literary horror novels ever written. The prose is gorgeous and the writing flows. The characters are varied and exquisitely drawn, believable and nearly tangible. The horror is achieved through mounting dread and rarely relies on gore to disturb, leaning more toward creatures with twinkling yellow eyes slowly climbing the stairs toward their victims, or a creepy child staring through a window. I\u2019ve always found subtle horror far scarier than violence and gore. Moreover, it\u2019s what I don\u2019t see that truly frightens me, as my imagination is more terrifying than anything another author could imagine. This is the essence of Ghost Story. This is where the novel succeeds the most. The subject matter is insidious. It burrows. Digs. Nests. I will admit, however, that Ghost Story is a chore to get into. It\u2019s the epitome of a slow burn. You will be tempted to put the book down, but I beg of you, push through the tedious opening chapters. Everything makes pays off by the end, and every word is needed. I don\u2019t know many horror novels of this length of which the same can be said. In summation: Ghost Story is a novel better read if you know nothing about it. It\u2019s a bit of terror that worms into you and takes roots. One of the truly nightmare-inducing additions to horror literature. If you\u2019re a fan of the genre, do yourself a favor and read this book. Tell Gregory Bates that E. sent ya.

I read a hell of a lot of sci-fi (SF), I read about a couple of fantasy (F) titles a year, but I've been neglecting the horror fiction (H) genre in recent years. The reason is that besides Stephen King I don't tend to hear much about exciting new horror titles. Sci-fi and fantasy books win the prestigious Hugo and Nebula awards and I am always aware of the winners. As far as I know the equivalent award for horror fiction is the Stoker Award and somehow people don\u2019t seem to talk about them very much. Anyway, to cut a long story short I miss reading horror fiction and want to get back to it.Ghost Story is Peter Straub\u2019s best known and most popular book, I remember reading it in my teens when it was on the bestsellers list, I remember liking it but for the life of me cannot remember any of the details. Having just reread it this is not so surprising as this is quite a complex story and the title is somewhat misleading. The book is divided into several parts with a nonlinear timeline. It starts off intriguingly with a 24 pages prologue about a man who has kidnapped a strange little girl, but the kidnapper is more afraid of the kidnappee than the other way around. The girl seems to take it all in stride and may, in fact, not be a girl at all. After this prologue the story goes back to a few years earlier where a group of for elderly gentlemen meet on a regular basis to share ghost stories which may or may not be true. They call themselves \u201cThe Chowder Society\u201d, apparently there is some kind of therapeutic value for them in telling these stories; there has been an undertone of fear in this little club since one of their members died under mysterious circumstances at a party while in the company of an actress who disappeared.The next part of the book tells the story of Donald Wanderley, the child kidnapper from the prologue. He is a nephew of the dead club member of the Chowder Society and an author of a horror novel.After publication of his book he took a temporary job teaching at Berkeley, there he meets and falls madly in love with a mysterious beautiful girl. They get on famously, make wedding plans and one day she just disappears; next thing he knows she meets his brother David in another town, they fall in love and soon David dies under mysterious circumstances. The girl disappears again.Ghost Story is not a whodunit, but it is not really about ghosts (though a few do show up). The story is quite a complex but not at all hard to follow. A creepy atmosphere pervades the entire book and the reader what is going on with the disappearing girls and the dead people they leave behind. It is meticulously written by Straub. The supernatural element often has a hallucinogenic feel to it and the climax is quite rousing. The characters are well drawn but not particularly memorable. I find that Straub\u2019s storytelling is not as taut as it could be and the pacing drags a little in the earlier parts of the book; too many scenes of the old gents pottering around grumbling. His brand of horror is subtle and often psychological, there is very little in the gore department.If you are looking for an elegantly written, unusual and complex horror story this is for you, but how many people are looking for such a thing?If you are reading this in October this would be a great Haloween read."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17371689-kimberly", "userReview": "Although GRs marks this as my second read, it's actually my third. (I read this one as a teenager for the first time). One of Straub's best books, imho. Still, this is not one that promises instant gratification, or perfect closure. It's a multi-layerd novel, that leaves a lot to the imagination of the reader.

A short summary would include: tornadoes; big dogs; bullies; the basement; fire; music class; swimming lessons; spiders; cat burglars; and girls. As I got a bit older, say around middle school and high school, that list changed. Some items remained (girls, the possibility of being forced to sing in public), some fell away (tornadoes, big dogs, swimming), and some new fears were added (school dances, acne, various other complex social interactions). Now, as an adult, the list has changed entirely. I don\u2019t fear the weather, or the water, or women (though I still do not understand them). And I\u2019m not afraid of the many, many things that the local and national news tells us to fear. I\u2019m not scared of airplane crashes, murderers, or terrorist attacks. This is not because I am brave, which I am certainly not, or because I am idiot, which is debatable; rather, my limited understanding of probabilities allows me to rest assured that I am far likelier to die in a car crash because I am texting, than I am to plummet earthward in a Boeing 747, and that the mounting nights of pizza and hard drinking are more lethal to my person than a sociopathic killer just escaped from the county asylum on a dark and stormy night.The simple fact is that for most of us, all the terrorists and all the murderers and all the faultily-constructed planes in all the world are not nearly as likely to hurt us than uncontrolled cell growth within our own bodies. Sure, I get a little jittery when my plane hits turbulence; and yes, I sneak around my own house with a baseball bat every time I hear a bump in the night. But truthfully, the only thing that really scares me is cancer. That kind of fear, though, based solidly in statistical reality, is almost too much to bear. It\u2019s impossible to live your life constantly thinking about that possibility, that probability, lingering up ahead in the future. We need distractions. So we distract ourselves with other fears. Not just terrorists, airplanes, and killers, but sex offenders and immigrants and razor-studded apples on Halloween and China\u2019s emergence as an economic powerhouse. This is not to say that these fears are baseless (well, the fear of immigrants and China are), but we\u2019re talking about probabilities. Can these things be dangerous? Yes. Are they statistically likely to be dangerous to you? No. These fears, though, play an important psychological role by diverting our attention. And this is not a new phenomenon. Human beings have always been scaring each other. I venture that Neanderthals in their caves would gather round the fire and swap stories about a legendary wooly mammoth with a taste for blood, even though they were more likely to die from an infection caused by scraping a knee on a rock. Peter Straub\u2019s Ghost Story plays with this idea of spook stories. At its center are four old men \u2013 Lewis Benedikt, Sears James, Frederick Hawthorne and John Jaffrey \u2013 who have a haunted past; in order to cope with this past, they get together and tell ghost stories to each other. Scaring each other becomes cathartic. I could go on with the plot, I suppose, but one of the pleasures (or frustrations, depending on your nature) of this book is how you gain understanding gradually, as the story unfolds. For instance, the novel opens with a brief prologue in which a man we do not know has apparently kidnapped a child we do not know. These scenes won\u2019t pay off for many hundreds of pages, and to say anything more ventures into spoiler territory. Besides, the plot is relatively dense, and if I tried to explain it, I\u2019d probably get it wrong anyway. Suffice it to say, the thing or things that is haunting our four main characters has returned to the small town of Milburn, New York. And it didn\u2019t come for the maple syrup festival. I\u2019ll leave it to you to discover the rest. What I appreciated about Ghost Story was that it understood the nature of fear. Fear is that moment when you think something is about to happen; it is that part in a horror movie when the main character is about to open the closet door, and you, the viewer, start to duck your head beneath the blanket. When something finally jumps out of the closet, and the main character starts running, and you scream and spill popcorn, that\u2019s not fear. That is the release of tension. The reason I always liked the first Friday the 13th film is because it recognized this distinction. The whole movie was people being watched and stalked by something faceless and nameless and left to our imaginations. There is very little running through the woods, which is good, because chase scenes aren\u2019t scary. In the 7,000 sequels that followed, the distinction was lost; the killer was known, was given shape and form, and all that was left was to run. The most elegant metaphor I can think of to explain this is lovemaking. Please, bear with me. A good ghost story (like Ghost Story) is like that Spanish or Italian lover with the sensitive eyes and velvety voice, the one who drank wine from your navel and has nothing but time to devote to all manner of foreplay. This Spanish or Italian will taunt and tickle and tease and sing you a lilting love-song in Spanish or Italian that you can\u2019t understand before finally bringing you to that place you want to go. A bad ghost story is like a drunk high-school student pawing at you in the backseat of a Honda Civic, concerned only with the end-release. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Did I say the \u201cmost elegant\u201d metaphor? Because I meant to say crass and vaguely disturbing. Ghost Story takes its time reaching the climax, and this is a good thing. As long as things are still a bit unclear, as long as you can\u2019t quite see around the next corner, the novel retains tension. I\u2019m not saying it will scare you. It won\u2019t make you scream aloud, for the simple reason that, unlike a movie, you can look away at any time and stop the action. However, there are parts that will give you the creeps; and there will be parts where your eyes will try to cheat by skipping ahead; and there is a chance, if you read this before bed and take a slug of Nyquill, you will have odd nightmares. What I liked about Ghost Story, other than the fact it was like a Spanish or Italian lover, is that it made a real attempt to stay grounded in reality. Obviously, when you are dealing with ghosts, there is a paranormal or supernatural element involved. The more things tilt towards those elements, the less scared I become, for the simple fact that I can no longer relate to the world being described. To that end, Peter Straub makes an enormous effort to give his characters backgrounds and back-stories and meaningful traits. He grounds the most fantastical elements by devoting equal time to the human element. I\u2019m not saying that he achieves supreme psychological depth with each person, but he certainly surmounts the confines of his genre (and goes far beyond you might expect in a book titled Ghost Story). One of my favorite aspects of Ghost Story is its sense of place. Straub spends a lot of time making the hamlet of Milburn into a character. You get to know its layout, its history, its local hangouts, and you meet dozens and dozens of its denizens. Indeed, you meet so many, you might want to keep a list (this will come in handy when attempting to recall who is sleeping with who, and who just died). Ghost Story is horror with a literary bent. Sure, there are some lines of dialogue that land with all the grace of me dropping War and Peace on my toe. But that\u2019s to be expected. For the most part, the level of the writing defies the primitiveness of its subject. You see this not only in the care taken with the characters (both main and supporting), but with the story\u2019s complex structure, which involves numerous flashbacks and stories-within-stories. Of course, as with any ghost story, there has to be a \u201cBoo!\u201d moment. At some point, the mysteries start to resolve themselves, the enemy takes shape, and our heroes must find a way to kill it. I\u2019ll admit, my attention started to wane towards the end, once the explanatory dialogue started flying (and there is a lot of explaining to do). Eventually, there is a final battle between good and evil, human and not-human, and it is suitably over-the-top and gory, for those that expect that sort of thing, and when the dust settles all the puzzle pieces come together to form a whole. It satisfies, I suppose, but is not nearly as interesting as the long, detailed, creepy road that led to that point."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "[ the above mentioned beings our protagonists have been led into self-destructive, even evil acts.

It begins with the frigid voices of old men swapping ghostly stories, then settles back and unwinds as the demons of these old men's stories come to possess the world of the present. This is a book that starts slow, wrapping itself around the reader. You, like the characters in the book, think that you can easily escape for the first hundred pages. But the narrative tightens and you soon learn that escape was always an illusion. This is a book that combines the chill of the New York winter with the arthritic helplessness of old man nightmares. It plays shamelessly with reality. The devices Straub incorporated in this book are so subtle that they had to be corrupted or ignored entirely when a movie was made based on this book.

But some of the descriptions of the premise that I'd read were somewhat misleading as to what's really going on in the book (and that comment applies to the above description as well), and its bestseller status prejudiced me against it. (It's true that sales tend to measure hype, not quality --but sometimes, as here, the hype is amply justified. :-)Ghost Story both draws from, and significantly contributes to, the classic horrific strand of the supernatural fiction genre. In its premise and its depiction of supernatural entities, it's original, even groundbreaking; but it also stands within the great tradition in its solid, accessible literary craftsmanship and its fundamentally moral orientation --a consciousness of the difference between good and evil, and the basic nature of the difference. The malevolent supernatural entities here are not demons in the Biblical sense (and the book makes little reference to the Christian tradition at all, though it isn't incompatible with it, IMO); but like demons, their principal weapon is temptation and deceit, and the principal weapon against them is an ability --which not all people have the wisdom and moral strength to do-- to resist and see through that. (And, as in the dark science fiction of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos or in Arthur Machen's \"The Great God Pan,\" a face-to-face encounter with the reality of these entities can drive naive people, whose rosy view of the world has never imagined the possibility of ultimate evil, into suicidal madness; but Straub doesn't succumb to the existential pessimism of Lovecraft and Machen.)The pacing here is excellent, Straub's prose is perfectly adapted to his subject matter, and his characterizations are superb. (Three of the important characters are elderly men and another is the wife of one of these; but Don Wanderley, who is arguably the main character, is a younger man, another major character is a teen, and a wide range of ages and social classes are represented in the well-drawn cast.) Straub brings his small-town upstate New York setting --especially the suffocating, claustrophobic cold of the area's winter blizzards--to such vivid life that I thought he might be a New York native (actually he hails from Wisconsin.) My only real criticism is that the prologue is off-putting at first, and its connection to the body of the story not immediately apparent. But the reader begins to see and understand the connection as the story unfolds, and then the prologue contributes to the novel's suspense, which absolutely crackles toward the end! (I read mostly while exercising on a stationary bike, and time my sessions with an oven timer; but for much of the book, it was all I could do to quit when the timer sounded --and if my self-control, as measured on one personality test I took in a grad school class, didn't literally go off the chart, I probably couldn't have!) Another caveat is that the book practically cries out for a sequel (not to provide any spoilers :-)), but Straub didn't write one.There is some bad language here, including three f-words (in 483 pages) and a certain amount of non-explicit illicit sex goes on; but the two characters who use the worst language are people no sane reader would feel any remote temptation to imitate in any respect, and Straub doesn't portray sexual sin as attractive --actually, more the reverse. Readers who don't want scary reads or are bothered by a lot of violence should be warned, though, that the fear quotient here is quite high, and so is the body count; and a good deal of the violence, in itself, is grisly, though (to his credit) Straub's descriptions are usually restrained rather than graphic, and don't stress the gore."}, {"userName": "Ken McKinley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5919799-ken-mckinley", "userReview": "Ghost Story was a ground-breaking classic written in 1979 that set the bar a mile high for any paranormal tale to come after it. Straub's story isn't a quick read. It's a slow burn through multiple layers that weave in and out of the story. That doesn't mean it's a bad thing. On the contrary, I loved the eerie atmosphere he created along with such detailed characters that weren't flat and one-dimensional. I've read a few negative reviews on here and the common theme is that it was too much or they found it boring. I feel bad for these people that they have no patience and that their short attention spans won't let such a wonderful tale slowly unfold before their very eyes. For those of you that don't want fast food horror and enjoy savoring a creepy atmospheric tale, look no further. When I say that this story is layered, I mean thick, rich multiple layers. It's set in the small, idyllic town of Milburn in rural New York. In 1979, there is no mention of chain stores or houses that all look alike in Milburn. These are mom and pop run places and every home is as unique as the residents that live in them. A group of older gentlemen that call themselves the Chowder Society meet at a different member's home every month. The rules are that they wear evening clothes, don't drink too much, and rotate through the members on who was going to tell a story for that evening. The meeting following the peculiar death of one of their members, to break the tension, a member asked \"What's the worst thing you've ever done?\" To which he replied, \"I won't tell you that, but I'll tell you the worst thing that ever happened to me...the most dreadful thing.\" And so the ritual of telling ghost stories began. Unfortunately, this also brought on the nightmares that would plague the members. You see, fifty years ago they were part of a terrible accident and a young girl died and now she wants her revenge.Straub creates such a realistic setting in Milburn that you'd swear he was from NY. Oddly enough, he grew up in Wisconsin. The atmosphere and character development is what makes Ghost Story so effective. The bitter cold of the winter blizzard. The isolationism of being cut off from one another. The eerie dread that permeates through the story as you try to decipher what is real and what is imagination. So kick back in your recliner. Have a drink by your side and let Straub chill you to the bones with this tale.5 out of 5 starsYou can also follow my reviews at the following links:https://kenmckinley.wordpress.comhttps://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5...http://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A2J1...TWITTER - @KenMcKinley5"}, {"userName": "Kealan Burke", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695095-kealan-burke", "userReview": "One of my all-time favorite horror novels, and the one that made me an immediate fan of Peter Straub's work.

You have a wonderful writer. You have what is allegedly his \"magnum opus\". You have a decent movie-adaptation, which, although weighted down with several flaws, boasts a storyline that is both original and creepy.Having read his later, Vietnam-based novel, 'Koko', I'd had very high hopes with 'Ghost Story'. But it all became apparent, fairly quickly, that this \"supposed\" masterpiece - Stephen King has labelled it this - was really nothing more than an over-the-top, overlong, and overrated mess. Peter Straub's success, and writing career, has been overall quite muted. He has written several books, but only 'Ghost Story' and 'Koko' seem to have found any considerable audience. Most readers probably remember him as \"that guy who helped Stephen King write 'The Talisman' and 'Black House'. However, this novel has enjoyed a long-standing place in what both critics and general readers deem the most important in modern horror fiction. It is totally fair to say that this novel paved the roads for his excellent follow-up, 'Koko' ... and so while I almost certainly didn't love this book - didn't even enjoy it for the most part - I'd still admit that I respect it as decent literature. And so I'll not be immature and rude, but fair and informative, as to why I didn't like this as much as I should have. Firstly - and this is something that plagued 'Koo' as well - Peter Straub has a very slow way of unravelling this story. Now please understand that I have complete respect for that; I really admire and appreciate those authors like King, and Blatty, and Crichton, that unlike less talented writers like Brown and Child (who're all pace, and no buildup), are comfortable with setting the cards out leisurely, providing us instead with some surprisingly interesting and well-formed characters. Straub is nothing short of genius in his ability to flesh out his characters, doing so to the point where they actually feel like real, genuine people. But I didn't like them as much as I think he wanted me to. Ricky Hawthorne is fine - nothing unlikeable about that man - but that basically sums him up, I think. He's simply \"the normal guy\" ... and the only thing that really helped me to relate to him was that I also had a bastard of a cold whilst reading this book. On that level I related to Ricky very deeply. But otherwise ... Sears James is a little better. But he still amounts to little more than the impatient and irritable leader of the pack. Lewis Benedict was easily the most interesting. But he was also a womaniser, fucking different women on and off every week. He also sleeps with his Ricky's wife occasionally. Real top guy. And finally, Don Wanderley and Peter Barnes could just as well have been Ben Mears and Mark Petrie from 'Salem's Lot'. I also couldn't stand Stella Hawthorne. I really thought she was a fucking bitch, and she did not deserve the reader's affections just because she suddenly decides to stop messing around with other men, and turns full cunt-mode on her current toyboy. 'Koko' was very slow-moving as well. But that had soul, man!!! This felt just as dead and cold as the dreary Milburn setting. Even when the story reaches its more suspenseful stages - scenes such as Peter and Jim sneaking into Eva Galli's house - the pace is just way too drawn-out, resulting in the simple trespassing of a house being stretched into three damned chapters!!! But let's put the infuriating slowness aside. Let's talk about what ruins this book even more. Frankly, it's the fact that when all the longwinded buildups finally do pay off, they all do the equivalent of a mentally-unstable cashier throwing hundreds and hundreds of notes at you, crying \"Take it!! Take it all!!\" when all you asked was to get your change back in two $5 notes. Similar to Stephen Nutcase when he missteps, Straub astonished me by straying so far from the taut, realistic horrors of 'Koko', into this ludicrous concept of time-defying shapeshifters that are granted the ability to reincarnate more times than that annoying 'Just Be Good To Me' song. Don't you even think about it, Douchebags...The fact that this novel's monsters weren't even ghosts - like the title suggests - was irritating. The fact that they come across so nonsensical and unscarily is quite a bit more offensive. With the exception of a few creepy moments - Sears's recount of his time as a young teacher being the most noteworthy - I never felt even slightly unnerved by what was happening in this book. The one time I actually (literally) screamed out in pure fright, was when reading whilst sitting back in the bath, relaxing after a hard day's work, when suddenly, the pole for the shower-curtain fell from above me, splashing water all over the floor. Otherwise, it wasn't scary at all, and so does not even come close to being \"the greatest horror novel ever written\". The man who said that was, after all, the man who said that his version of 'The Shining' was scarier than Stanley Kubrick's. For 'Slow Children' indeed ...Maybe 'The Exorcist' was the greatest horror novel ever written. Maybe 'Dracula'. Maybe even 'It'. But not 'Ghost Story', for God's sake. And before I round this off, there is still one more thing I want to mention. I understand that these things were not ghosts. But they still bore certain similarities. They did, Sir. Please don't interrupt me again.If I were to consider these \"things\" as ghosts, then I can still give nothing but straight criticism for how unbelievable they were. I prefer my ghosts to be more like those in 'The Sixth Sense', or 'The Changeling', or 'What Lies Beneath'. Ghosts that are limited by their ethereal status; ghosts that perhaps are not even aware that they are dead, are just spurred on by an unexplainable need to see vengeance for whatever deed has thrown them into such a cold, confusing disarray. But these assholes know exactly what they are. And they are so confident with their executions that they often choose to mock and tease their targets, even though they fail almost every time they do try to do something proper.Some people have said that this book carries similar traits to the likes of Stephen King. I couldn't agree with them more. This book sucks in all the ways that 'Salem's Lot', 'The Shining' and 'Carrie' sucked ... except unlike those far superior novels, this one doesn't really have any redeeming features at all. But on the whole, 'Ghost Story' really isn't a terrible book. I had just been expecting so much more, and so for its failure, I have to be more unforgiving than usual. It could have been awesome. Funnily, most people still think it is. I just have to say that I am not one of them, and my liking for Peter Straub has, sadly, been diminished somewhat.I will be sending him an apology letter - and a month's worth of free gym membership - in the morning.

It probably falls in the 4.5 star category. Why not 5? It's close, I'll say that. But as good as this book is, it never really grabbed me the way I need to be for a book to get the coveted 5th star. That's no fault of the book, and it's one I could even see getting the bump to 5 in the future on a re-read.It's slowly paced, yet not painfully slow. It's really not slow at all, but feels like it is because it takes a smooth journey. It does cover a lot of time, tying the past with the present. It certainly does not feel like a book with inflated word count just for the sake of word count.Ghost Story is layered nicely. Several threads are wound together. It wasn't scary to me so much, but it was definitely freaky and disturbing. My previous experience with Straub is pretty limited, having read The Talisman and Black House, both co-written with Stephen King, as well as a reading of Floating Dragon in my teen years. The first two I've read fairly recently, but I don't remember the other very well at all. But in this limited experience, I can say that I was reminded of Black House, which is one of my favorite novels. Straub has a storytelling talent for bringing evil to life and making it seem rather dark and, well, evil.The plot structure reminds me of two other Stephen King novels a little bit: 'Salem's Lot and It. It has that \"old town set in its ways is going to get royally fucked over\" bit from 'Salem's Lot to go along with that \"shit happened to young people 50 years ago and now it's coming back to bite them in the ass\" tone of It.It's nicely done. This isn't a story about Casper the Friendly Ghost, but some really badass horrors of the night. Certainly no shaking of chains and howling in the cellars here.

That been said I finally started \u201cGhost Story\u201d which everyone said was Straub\u2019s best and the best book ever about ghosts\u2026etc. etc. I have to say I had to force myself to read this book, normally I can read a book I am interested in a few days, this one took me about 12 days. It was very hard for me to get into, it was very wordy and a ton of dialogue which I don\u2019t mind if the dialogue is interesting. The characters with the exception of a few came across very flat and mundane. The story was dragged out over a snail\u2019s pace. And I am sure some will read this review and assume I didn\u2019t get it or couldn\u2019t understand the author setting the mood, which is not the case a great example of a book that sets a great mood is \u201cthe Shining\u201d or \u201cHell House\u201d. The book did have some interesting parts that I enjoyed reading, it just took hundreds of pages to get to them. Overall I was disappointed, even if I read this back in 1980 I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it.

I have to say that this wasn't a light read, the first half of the book is full of details that become important later on the story but if you endure, the second half of the book is truly amazing.It can be confusing at first because the prologue take place moments before the ending of the story so it only make sense as you progress through the book. I think this was great because it wrapped up the story perfectly.You may think that ghost aren't scary but trust me, the ghosts described by Straub on this book are very creepy and relentless. Also he gives a really original vision about them. I don't want to spoil the story, but there's uncertainty about what these supernatural beings truly are (not for me, I'm convinced that they're ghosts but whatever, read this book and make your guess).Another good aspect of this novel was that the main characters are four elderly men that formed a group called \"The Chowder Society\" where they tell each other horror stories. The setting is another thing that I really liked, it reminded me Salem's Lot by Stephen King because Milburn is a creepy little town in the middle of nowhere, an ideal scenario for a horror story.I totally recommend this book. Be warned that this is not an easy read (especially the first half) but if you keep reading you're rewarded with an extremely original horror story.I won't compare Peter Straub with Stephen King, he's not better or worse only different. I find his books to be extremely detailed but they are really well written and I think that fans of Stephen King would enjoy his novels.As a final note, Straub connects his novels: Ricky Hawthorne (one of the members of the Chowder Society and a main character on this book) is mentioned in Floating Dragon (a great book that I also recommend) where his nephew is one of the characters.
