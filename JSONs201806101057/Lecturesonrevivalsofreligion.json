I really enjoy this book, it is a great read. Of course it makes me feel like a terrible person; but it is an extremely insightful view on life and Christianity."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8805759-kimberly", "userReview": "A classic and very influential book."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5033050-jeff", "userReview": "Good book.

Consequently, these engaging lectures are written in a simple style, with everyday examples, and possess a periodic humor and charm. Finney's theology in these lectures is controversial--some have found it liberating, while others have publicly denounced it. But, no matter one's views on Finney's theology, his Lectures covers a wide range of topics, including the nature of a revival, how to preach the gospel, directions and instructions for sinners, and spiritual growth. A key theologian, Finney had an important impact on the Second Great Awakening. Thus, there is no better place to learn about Finney or revivals than his Lectures on Revivals of Religion.", "title": "Lectures on revivals of religion", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9761547-lectures-on-revivals-of-religion", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1394346684l/9761547.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4645522.Charles_Grandison_Finney", "name": "Charles Grandison Finney"}], "type": ["Religion", "Religion", "Church", "Religion", "Spirituality"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9761547-lectures-on-revivals-of-religion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348105.Lectures_on_Revivals_of_Religion_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348110.Lectures_on_Revival", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2584133-lectures-on-revivals-of-religion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348096.The_Autobiography_of_Charles_G_Finney", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348101.Power_From_On_High", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348103.The_Original_Memoirs_of_Charles_G_Finney", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348097.Finney_s_Systematic_Theology", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348107.Experiencing_the_Presence_of_God"]}
