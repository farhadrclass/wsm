Kailin Gow does an impeccable job at describing the extent of emotions that Jaegar feels in his transition. I have found that when Kal and Jaegar/Stuart/Octavius speak via telepathy, it enhances the storyline considerably. They all feel each other's pain, joy, etc. This forms a stronger connection for the quad. I relished every word from start to finish.

Jaegar is being forced to consume Kalina\u2019s Life\u2019s Blood, which will turn him from Kalina\u2019s friend and suitor into a very dangerous enemy who will stop at nothing until she is drained of all her Life\u2019s Blood or turned into a vampire.While the initial pages pull the reader into the story once again, the lack of movement of the storyline through the course of this book, until the last several pages, makes this a frustrating read. The majority of the story consists of Kalina\u2019s inner monologue as she flip-flops between what she wants and doesn\u2019t want, who she loves and doesn\u2019t love, and what she should or shouldn\u2019t do. And while in many books, this inner crisis can be tormenting in a good way, that is not the case here.The author, whose previous two books in the series introduced entertaining characters and an interesting plot, chose instead for the main character to wax poetic, redundantly, about who she is \u2013 whether human, half-human, vampire, half-vampire, or something other \u2013 and about times gone by \u2013 when she first met Jaegar, her time in Europe with Octavius, the simpler times when she was happily dating Stuart.Revisiting events from previous novels while reminiscing about the past along with a character can be enjoyable, but when it becomes a majority of the book, and is from a past that is just days, weeks or months previous in the life of the character, it feels disingenuous. In a series that is set to span five books, if there is not enough material to keep the story moving along, perhaps a shorter series would have been a better option.This series as a whole has its merits \u2013 even if this installment is lacking \u2013 with characters in constant peril, the jealousy inherent in a love triangle turned quadrangle, and a heroine whose feelings are torn between each of these men. And, for a young adult novel, this book has some rather graphic love scenes and coarse language making it edgier than some of the books in the YA universe.However, while the ideas and creativity are there, the book is riddled with not only grammatical errors (as were the first two), but numerous incorrect and unusual similes, metaphors and descriptive phrases."}, {"userName": "Tiffany Holme", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454067-tiffany-holme", "userReview": "WOW!! Okay excuse me while I try to wrap my head around all of this. If you know me or even follow me you must know my love of Kailin Gow. I am the biggest fan girl when it comes to her books. This one actually blew me away! There was so very much going on and so much that happened and I having such a hard time processing it!  Kalina may be home but things are far from back to normal. She is back to trying to figure out who she is meant to love and trying to forget her one true love. I know confusing right. Well without ruining it for you completely, she knows who her heart and soul wants but that person doesn't seem to want her. Talk about torn and heart broken. That does not stop her from standing up for herself though. It amazes me that every time I start a new book Kalina becomes a little more independent.  The Greystone brothers are still present even if they aren't all the same. By not the same I mean one of them was forced to drink a vial of Kalina's blood. In case you haven't heard of this series I wont tell you what that does but it isn't good. Not by a long shot. There is also the question of the feelings that each of the brothers have for Kalina. Will they be enough to keep them all from turning on her? It becomes the question of if love is really enough. Octavius is also back. *DROOL*. I will full out say that Octavius is the embodiment of all things masculine. I mean he beats basically every other man out (Chance from Fire wars is still #1). He is trying to defend Kalina and keep the danger away being the only remaining vampire from The Consortium of Vampires. He has lived many years and has a loyal following, is feared by many and wants nothing more than to just be with Kalina even if it isn't possible. This book was seriously the most intense one in the series thus far. Some serious change happened and some BIG shockers as well. Best hint you will get is that there is a big sacrifice and I had tears in my eyes and actually had to take a moment to regain my composure. I can't even express how much I love this fast paced, action packed series. Between the emotions that fly and the drama that goes down I am not sure if I am proceeding to book 4 anxious or excited."}, {"userName": "Steffy2106", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2170446-steffy2106", "userReview": "I really like book 3 of the Pulse series. We finally get to find out a bit more about Kalina origin and I really think that way Ms Gow explained it is very original. That\u2019s not a theory I ever read about before. Also I really like how Kalina get even tougher. She is finally realizing what and who she is and she is fighting and boy without spoiling we can say the girl can kick butt!Now the love interests\u2026.you can say there is some steamy scenes that made me go \u2019wow\u2019 in good way of course. I\u2019m glad this love pentagon turned into a triangle. Kalina is starting to realize the motives of some suitors and some dramatic circumstances is creating a new paradigm. Ms Gow also succeeded to do something only a few author managed before, she made me doubt about the Team I\u2019m on. I\u2019m a die hard Team Octavius but I have to admit that at the end of the book I was \u201cMaybe\u2026..is better for her\u201d and it surprised me. Of course I have to complain that I didn\u2019t get enough sexy Octavius in that book but I guess we do have to give every vampire a chance lol *sigh*Now some spoilers please don\u2019t read if you haven\u2019t read the books yet. Okay?Last chance to stop reading\u2026..Spoiler!! Concerning Jaegar I really liked him in the book ( of course I like him when he is a struggling psycho, maybe something is wrong with me) but how he tried to fight the dark side effect of the Life blood prove that he is deeply in love with Kalina. As his transformation as a human I think it only work to some extent is because even if she loves him, it\u2019s not deep enough, he is not THE ONE. I think if Octavius were to disappear he would be the one she should be with. She loves him enough for her blood not to be a curse but I think that THE ONE is Octavius (told you I was stubborn) I\u2019m glad there is still a chance for Kalina and Octavius. Jaegar? Octavius? Only the future will tell and all I can say is that I can\u2019t wait to sink my teeth in book 4!! :)"}, {"userName": "Cristy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3779025-cristy", "userReview": "To be honest I was a bit let down by BLOOD BURNED, the 3rd book in the Pulse series. I really loved the last book, LIFE'S BLOOD and was excited with high expectations after it's thrilling rollercoaster ride of action and romance. Unfortunately this third book fell short. It confused and sadden me that Kalina, our strong feisty heroin, who had come so far, grown so much, suddenly seemed like a different person altogether. To Gow's credit, there were still some great moments and twist in BLOOD BURNED, but they got lost a bit in the crazy muddle of her regular life. On one hand she was having all this drama play out in her head, internal strife, mental torture through telepathy by the damaged (and my favorite vamp, evil or not) Jaegar, denied by her true love Octavius, the lives of all who she cares for in danger.. and what does she do?.. Kalian goes to prom.. What?!.. yep prom. It just felt bizarre. Also there were some conversations with her brother that had me scratching my head. I'm hoping that in the fourth book, Kalian returns to her former self that had me on the edge of my seat rooting for her in LIFE'S BLOOD... one step back, two steps forward?.. fingers crossed. Like I said before, there was some great stuff amongst the disjointedness of BLOOD BURNED and Gow seemed to be getting the story back on track by the end. A little weary, but still confident in this series' potential, I look forward to greatness in BLUE BLOOD, book 4."}, {"userName": "Amy (Books, College, and Other Random Things)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4749592-amy-books-college-and-other-random-things", "userReview": "*May contain spoilers from previous books.Mal has captured Aaron and Jaegar, and even goes as far as forcing Jaegar to drink some of Kalina\u2019s blood that Mal has taken. Jaegar is no longer the man that Kalina once loved. Now, Jaegar is evil and has set his mind to drain Kalina. The thing that scares Kalina is that she is still attracted to Jaegar but still misses Octavius terribly. Stuart is there to comfort her, and she finds that she is the rock that she needs right now. With her emotions raging, she believes that there is still hope for Jaegar, but Stuart isn\u2019t as convinced. Will Kalina be able to survive without turning into a vampire by the thirsty fangs of Jaegar?I really am enjoying this series so far. I like that Kailin\u2019s books are fast paced. I don\u2019t like that there are so many love interests, but I have a really hard time considering that as a bad part of this series because Kailin has the ability to make me question which guy I like best. I find myself constantly wrapped up in the individual scenes with Stuart, Jaegar, and Octavius. I think I am leaning towards Jaegar or Octavius more after some scenes. I also think that there are a lot of similarities among them with subtle differences.

Blood Burned is very dark and continues the story of Kalina who's Life Blood not only attracts vampires but calls out to those in Octavius' line. The story begins with Jaegar having been forced to drink Life's Blood by Mal making him turn into a sadistic vampire obsessed with Kalina. Stuart is left to protect Kalina who is continuing to with life as normal as possible. One of my biggest problems with this story was that just as I fell in love with Octavius he denies his love for Kalina and makes her choose a brother. Granted it is out of his love for her in this impossible situation, but I still don't understand why he couldn't protect her just as well by her side. Jaeger finds Kalina but it wasn't hard she was back in Rutherford anyway. Kalina discovers more about the powers she holds as a carrier. Kalina also refuses to believe Jaeger is all bad.

Also, my frustrations were more directed towards Stuart and Octavious... I am really beginning to think that they are really just little boys than strong, vampire men... rather than Kalina. Kalina impressed me with her strength in this book-when she stops and thinks through her situation(s) she becomes centered and understands what needs to be done, rather than panic and go with her first instinct.

Kailin did a wonderful job in creating this vampire world. --Melissa Silva - The BookshelfI devoured this book. From the moment I received the review copy in the mail, I couldn't put it down until I was finished. Mystery and romance clouded the beginning. The vampire hunks are more than sexy, they're complex. No wonder Kalina can't choose between them. I can see Kalina as a real teenager on the brink of adulthood. Her grief for Aaron's death felt real. Then her elation in finding Stuart, someone close to Aaron, who reminded her of Aaron, felt real. Her discovery of who she is felt real. Some of the situation was comical, especially sensitive topics (Kalina trying to deal with her hormones) was handled with a sense of humor. The ending is wonderful and I would not have guessed it. Again, Ms. Gow has shown an understanding of teenage girls and some of the issues they deal with in growing up. Boys, love, sex, school, friendships, family - she covers it all. It says in my copy PULSE is Book 1 of 5. I can't wait to read the entire series. --Naya's Girls Night Out Book PicksMs. Gow does it again with this new series. Like in Bitter Frost, Pulse manages to be entertaining and filled with deeper meanings and symbolism. I was lucky to meet Ms. Gow in person where she mentioned Pulse deals with many issues older teen girls tackle in everyday life. There are symbolism in Pulse, as there are in Bitter Frost and Rise of the Fire Tamer. She mentioned a discussion sheet for teachers and groups will be available soon. Besides this, Pulse is an entertaining book with mystery, a sense of gothic even though it is contemporary, and lots of romance. I enjoy the idea of the legend. As far as vampire series for teens (older teens, especially), this is one of the more positive series out there. --Dayna C - Teen Trends DESCRIPTION:Kalina has returned back to Rutherford, but now there are more problems than before. The Consortium of Vampires has been destroyed except for one - Octavius - and the most powerful of vampires has been unleashed. This sets off the ultimate horror - one of the Greystone Brothers has been turned, and his love for Kalina has turned into a destructive obsession. Now armed with an unspeakable power and thirst, he has sent Kalina and the other brothers who love and protect her a shocking threat.
