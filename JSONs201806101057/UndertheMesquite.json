So this is the Theatrical Cut.I could go on and on about how gorgeous Ms Garcia McCall\u2019s writing is and how she seamlessly flits between Spanish and English words and explores two completely different cultures and the issues that come with being uprooted and how perfectly she captures and portrays the emotions that come hand-in-hand with illness in a close, loving family and pain and sadness and hope and about growing up and letting go and looking to the future without forgetting the past and the journey you must go on and maternal love and\u2026. and\u2026. and\u2026..You know what?

Guadalupe Garcia McCall writes very simple, almost sweet poetry, but she also manages to convey so much about the experiences of a young girl, at home in two countries, and forced to shoulder much more than the average sixteen year old.The novel as a whole is very short, and is strung together with two to three page verses which highlight different small parts of Lupita\u2019s life: her role as the oldest sister in a family of eight children, her complicated relationship with her parents, her dreams, her Mexican-American identity, and her burgeoning independence. And overshadowing it all, tying it all together, is the very moving story of Lupita dealing with her mother\u2019s illness.I love the juxtaposition of Lupita\u2019s capable, resilient, perhaps overly responsible self at home with her complete bewilderment and loss in the face of her mother\u2019s illness. I highlighted both of these passages, and reading them together just breaks my heart:\u201cMami, I\u2019m good for more thanchanging diapers and putting little onesto sleep. I can bear up when thingsgo wrong. You\u2019re the one who raised me to be that way.\u201d\u201cSuddenly I realizehow much I can\u2019t control, how muchI am not promised.The thought of ithits me broadside. More tearssqueeze out. I wipe them away.\u201dHow much I am not promised. Isn\u2019t that beautiful? There\u2019s a ten to fifteen page glossary in the back, to define the Spanish words which are used frequently in her verse; however, I doubt you will even need it. She uses them so seamlessly\u2026even in another language; it\u2019s hard not to understand what she\u2019s saying.Perfect Musical PairingLila Downs \u2013 Ceilo Rojo (Red Sky)I think that this song is about a lost love, but when I was reading through the lyrics (in English\u2026because I\u2019m an ignorant American I only speak one language), I was so struck with all the feelings of loss that Guadalupe Garcia McCall so perfectly describes in this book.While I'm sleepingI feel that we walkThe two of us, very close to each other,Towards a blue skyBut when I wake up - the red skyYou are missing.Also seen on The Readventurer."}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876075-cara", "userReview": "I hadn't planned on writing a review for this book today, but my mind just kept turning the book over and over in my head and creating a restless energy that I can't seem to stop. This is going to sound corny but I wish that my heart could write the review for me because I don't think my mind has the ability to translate and convey why this book had such a strong impact on me. I can just feel myself get achy inside thinking about the book. A good ache though.Lupita has many dreams. She moved to the United States with her big family when she was six years old from Mexico. They have moved to the land where dreams are possible. Lupita has gotten used to America and her big family seems to be doing well too. When Lupita is a freshman in high school she finds out that her mom is diagnosed with cancer. How can her beautiful, strong, and caring mother have this and how can Lupita and her family hold onto their dreams when everything seems to be falling apart? This book had the perfect format for it. I can't imagine the book being written in any other way, it had to be in verse. It gives the story a beautiful flow and matches the pacing of Lupita's journey beautifully. I loved this character so much because she is responsible but also ambitious. I know lots of people believe the American dream is dead but I think it's there, we may just have to dig around for it a little deeper. These people come with fresh eyes and hearts and still cling and strive for this dream. How can you not love that? The author weaved in so much nature into the book as well, and how it can calm and move us at the same time. I love the analogy of the mesquite tree and people's perseverance. Garcia McCall also hits the Mexican American culture right on. The only reason why this book didn't get a five star rating from me was because I felt the ending lost a little steam, but there was so much for me to love about this book.I'm contemplating whether I should keep this paragraph or not but I guess I'll decide when I'm done. I would like to share the reason why I could connect so much with this book, and I think it's because of my background. I come from strong Hispanic roots and when I was in high school my mom had cancer (I am happy to report she's doing fantastic now). While Lupita is the eldest of eight, I am the eldest of four and though I wasn't as resilient as her, I felt a weight of responsibility just as she did. I recognized everyday things in my own life as well. People watching telenovlas, hardworking fathers, green-thumbed mothers, the close knit-siblings, the importance of religion, the power of praying as a family and so much else that I could identify with. The author perfectly described how empty and lost a home feels when a mother is ill. I hadn't realized it before but my mom was and is the pillar of our home. It seemed all the joy and ease was erased when she had gotten sick, and I saw the same thing happen to Lupita's family. There are a lot of books that I have read that I can relate to and make me feel the universal emotions all human beings feel, but I don't find many books that mirror my life so much. Lupita and her life weren\u2019t exactly like mine but it's the closest thing I have come across and for that I am grateful."}, {"userName": "Crowinator", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283407-crowinator", "userReview": "Sometimes I unintentionally hit a theme in my reading, and as I started tearing up at a section in this book, I realized it\u2019s the one of many stories I\u2019ve read in the last few months about a young person dealing with the loss of a parent to cancer. (The others are A Monster Calls and Putting Makeup on Dead People, and if I expand it even more, I can count Liesl & Po, where Liesel\u2019s father has just died from illness.) They all are wildly different in plot and execution but have the same emotionally resonant tone and take the characters through similar emotional landscapes: denial, bargaining, melancholy and sometimes outright despair, regret, anger, and the most complicated of tangled emotions, relief, the \u201cthank God it\u2019s over\u201d, and accompanying guilt. They all experience cathartic moments as well, where they eventually accept the loss and finding new meaning in their own lives.I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll go from here,but I want to make my own way.This feels right to me\u2014starting to walk toward the doors,holding Mami\u2019s old, blue suitcase,and rememberingthe love I carry with me. This doesn\u2019t mean that I think these books aren\u2019t all unique, because they are. But the big, weighty issues of what happens to a child, and by extension the rest of the family, when a parent dies provide the basis for all of these different stories, and I find the connections among them fascinating. The language Guadalupe Garcia McCall uses is pared down, shifting seamlessly between English and Spanish, and the line breaks are simple, but each poem tells a story, a little moment in Lupita\u2019s life, that add up to a complete picture: moving to America and feeling uprooted, trips back to Mexico, losing her accent to be a better actor and being made fun of for it, winning drama awards, watching telenovas, having her fifteenth birthday, writing poetry, running out of money and food, trying to parent her siblings, while the undercurrent is always her mother\u2019s illness and how that affects even the little things in Lupita\u2019s life. The poems are often tied together with metaphors, especially involving Mami\u2019s rose garden and the mesquite tree that grows stubbornly in the middle. Instead, I am outsidelooking for a sign from her.Where her garden used to bloom,dusty holes stare back at mefrom the barren soilof what is like a miniature graveyard.But the mesquiteis as strong as ever. This is really quite a meaningful, beautifully-written verse novel from a debut author (but accomplished poet)."}, {"userName": "Regina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104032-regina", "userReview": "Beautiful absolutely beautiful. Under the Mesquite is a story about a young girl growing up to adulthood. It is a story about saying good-bye and about the loss of a loved one so integral to one\u2019s life that it is impossible to imagine life without them. Under the Mesquite is about a family\u2019s journey across the border of one country and into another country and how people make cultural adjustments and acclimate to a new home. And, this story is about going home and how going home can help us figure out how to move forward. Despite the numerous threads of storylines and themes running through this book, it is a short book, written in verse and readable in a few hours. Do not let the style of the book \u2013 verse \u2013 turn you off from reading this. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of poetry; I just can\u2019t attach myself to the words of poetry in the same way I can a story. But this story is different. I immediately became emotionally involved in this story. The topic of meshing cultures and the journey of emigration is a difficult tale to write. Inevitably, multiple languages must be woven together to write the story; descriptions of cultural rituals \u2013 such as cooking \u2013 must be described. And it takes a very special author to write these day to day things in a way that is authentic in both the language of the originating country (in this case Mexico) and the language of the new home (USA) and is authentic culturally. Ms. Guadalupe Garcia McCall does this so very well; it is obvious that she has experienced this. Many authors try to make their story appear to contain a bilingual character and to do so, the author translates the occasional word in to, say Spanish. But from my experience, many authors who have not experienced the cross cultural reality \u2013 they translate the wrong word in to Spanish, putting emphasis where there never was. Or the author may describe a cultural habit that just does not take place. Ms. McCall never makes these mistakes; she uses Spanish in her English novel in a very authentic way but she also makes it accessible for her English only speakers, for example: \u201cLook at my beautiful, talented muchachita,\u201d she keeps telling Papi.\u201d\u201cAs the latest episode of her favorite telenovela unfolds, the soap opera drawing her in, the skins from the potatoes she is peeling drop into her apron like old maple leaves.\u201d\u201cEyes shimmering, I am a ratoncita, a sly little mouse.\u201dAnd to aid her readers, the author includes a glossary of Spanish terms and cultural references at the back of her book. On the topic of maturing, the main character is conflicted. She is already the oldest child in a house of 8 kids and has quite a few responsibilities but she is not ready to grow up:\u201cBut for me, se\u00f1orita means melancolia; setting into sadness. It is the end of wild laughter. The end of chewing bubble gum and giggling over nothing with my friends at the movies, our feet up on the backs of theater seats \u2026. Se\u00f1orita is a ni\u00f1a, the girl I used to be, who has lost her voice.\u201dMs. McCall writes very effectively the pull of adulthood and the sadness in leaving childhood behind. As I write this I think of my own oldest daughter and how conflicted she is about growing up. McCall captures it perfectly. Because, the main storyline is the young girl interacting with her beloved family, much of the book involves the lead character taking care of her siblings and waiting for her mother to die.\u201cMami\u2019s cultivating six budding daughters and two rowdy sons; eight thriving blue roses clustered together so closely, they tremble as they cling to the withering stem of her life.\u201d\u201cWaiting for la Muerte to take Mami is like being bound, lying face up on the sacrificial altar of the god Huitzilopochtli, pleading with the Aztec priest, asking him to be kind while he rips my heart out.\u201d\u201cSometimes she was a comfortable as a blanket, enveloping us in her warmth. She was so soft, we never wanted to let her go.\u201dDespite the difficult topics tackled in this verse driven novel, in the end, the story leaves the reader with hope, \u201csometimes it\u2019s best to take things down and start all over again.\u201d I highly recommend this short novel."}, {"userName": "Bookishrealm", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm", "userReview": "Update!

Back in middle school/early high school I used to write bad poetry. Then one day I had an epiphany that I was writing mopey teen poetry and stopped. Then I went through a phase where I decided that I didn't like or understand poetry. Until senior year of college when I took a literature course. We studied poetry and I discovered that I do in fact like some poetry (mopey teenagers need not apply.)So I'm still on shaky ground with poetry. I love \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" BUT I'm iffy when it comes to most new poems. Books written in verse make me EVEN MORE NERVOUS. I blame the indecent amounts of Wordsworth I had to read for a class during college. (During which my brain spazzed and was like novel length poem, I GET IT YOU LIKE NATURE).For a book written in verse to work there has to be a damn good reason for the stylistic choice. For Under the Mesquite it worked. The book is driven by emotion. The writing is not overdone, at times even sparse and always poignant. It's the story of a girl growing up as her mother slowly succumbs to cancer. It's heartbreaking, but not in a cheap way. Rather than focus on the details of the disease, the reader experiences what Lupita feels throughout her mother's sickness. Somehow the verse gives the emotion room to breathe.The emotions about growing up, sickness, family and loss ring so true. Because the verse is so genuine and natural, I cannot imagine this story told any other way.Here is one of my favorite passages:For my sisters, senorita meanshaving someone to worship: it isthe wonder of seeing their older sister lookinglike Cinderella on her way to the ball.But for me, senorita meansmelancolia: settling into sadness.It is the end of wild laughter.The end of chewing bubble gumand giggling over nothing...Stories involving cancer have been done, re-done and will continue to be done. I read those Lurlene McDaniel books back in middle school (aka all the teens die but HEY at least they fall in love first books). But this book felt different and refreshing. There is nothing trite about the the way this story is told.It's not a long book but there's a lot of life and growing up between it's pages. It flits between spanish and english, Texas and Mexico, childhood and adulthood seamlessly. It's a beautiful little book that I'm glad I stumbled across."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "\u2018Under the Mesquite\u2019 was kindly provided to me by Netgalley for Lee & Low Books.Interested in more of my reviews?

Lupita struggles with finding her own identity in a new place after her family moves from Mexico to the United States. To make matters worse she has discovered that her mother has cancer and will undergo surgery to hopefully give her more time on this Earth. Desperate to help in any way she can, Lupita takes care of her 7 younger siblings so that her father can take care of her mother.

Getting a few of these types of books under my belt, I\u2019ve never felt that books have suffered from being written in that format. Unfortunately, this was the case here for me.

Life was good for the large family--there are eight children--in Mexico, but because the father found work across the border, they moved north to Eagle Pass. They return to Mexico as often as possible, savoring happy times there as well as new experiences in the United States. Mami loves her rose bushes and plants them in the front yard. When a stubborn mesquite tree refuses to die, she finally gives up and leaves it there amid the roses. The tree will provide a sanctuary later when times get hard--and they certainly do. The book focuses on the period of time when Mami is diagnosed with cancer and must endure various treatments. Lupita, the oldest daughter, stays busy with drama and with her writing, but much of the burden for taking care of the younger children falls on her. Words provide her solace, even as all of the family's savings are used up to help pay for her mother's treatment. This is a story filled with pain and suffering but also hope and triumph as Lupita manages to survive all the difficulties that come her way. Clearly, the family bond and their cultural heritage help this young woman survive and thrive. There are so many magical moments and so much humor threaded through the pages, and the author juxtaposes those moments effectively, reminding readers that there are joyous times to be found amid life's challenges. A case in point is the event she describes of an unexpected haul of ice cream brought back to the house when an ice cream truck breaks down nearby. This is a memorable first book sure to inspire others.

Lupita, the oldest of eight children, learns to deal with her mother getting cancer as a high school student. Lupita's family lived in Mexico before moving to the United States. Fluent in both English and Spanish, Lupita, poetically narrates this story enriching the text with a beautiful blend of two cultures and languages. The chapter, Uprooted, can stand alone as a free verse poem. \"I doubted los girasoles [sunflowers] would understand me anymore, because now I was speaking a different language. I swallowed consonants and burdened vowels with a sound so dense, the words fell straight out of my mouth and hit the ground before they could reach the river's edge.\" The author's frequent use of nature-based metaphors and\u00a0similes\u00a0reminds me of the Romantic poets.Part One shows the family learning about mom's secret.\u00a0\u00a0The frightened Lupita barters with God that she'll become a nun if he will let her mom be free of cancer. She goes so far as to tell the nuns at church she wants to join their vocation. When the nuns show up at their house, her mom says, \"No!\"\u00a0Part Two is a flashback to when they lived in Mexico. Sometimes I am impatient with flashbacks because it feels like the story is being interrupted and the pacing slows too much. I felt that at this point in the story. We just find out Lupita's mom has cancer and then I'm reading about Lupita being told she can't go play with her friends Mireya and Sarita but has to play with her sisters. It didn't seem to move the plot forward but the author is showing that Lupita's mom expects family to come over friends. It is one of the reasons Lupita became a caretaker of her siblings as the cancer progressed, weakening her mom and drawing her dad's focus to be solely on taking care of her mom. At one point Lupita is taking care of the seven siblings while her dad takes care of their mom at the hospital six hours away. Lupita scrounges for food and tries to keep tabs on everyone as a 17-year-old. Her success is meager.Part Three, Four, and Five have more action and are emotionally charged as the family deals with their moms cancer. Many times I found myself making connections with the verses to my own life. For instance, my dad and his actions toward me as he deals with my mom's Alzheimers: \"Many times, though, / his anger is nothing more/ than a change of weather - / a blistering breeze, / a pool that's cooled -/ and he doesn't want to talk/ to anyone about it./ So now, not knowing / which face of sadness/ he might show, I play it safe/ and leave him alone.\" The rich evocative passages and unique images make reading a delightful traipse.Lupita changes internally from putting her family first to putting herself first. She realizes that she must move on with her life and dreams, while holding onto hope and memories. This is at the end and the change seemed somewhat abrupt. She comes to a realization at her Grandma's house, but I needed one more chapter to show her thinking about how to communicate with her dad who she knows will resist her wanting to go to college. Up to this point the parents have supported college, but now dad doesn't. I can infer why but I felt it needed to be told from Lupita's viewpoint why dad is having a change of heart. It did cross my mind that there is quite a bit of content that is going to appeal more to girls than boys. Lupita likes to watch soaps with her mom, thinks about clothes, puts makeup on her mom when she is sick, and cooks, cleans and watches her siblings. The theme of friendship is touched on when she gets into a fight with\u00a0Mireya and Sarita\u00a0about loosing her accent and trying to act white. Lupita uses drama to deal with her mom's cancer and her teacher gives some wise advice as she copes. While this is a short novel, it has a higher vocabulary and might be confusing for some readers with no prior knowledge of Mexico and its culture. The glossary will be helpful for defining words.

It is also written by a Mexican author who lives in the United States, namely Texas. I felt that from what little I know or have gleamed about Mexican culture, McCall presented an authentic look through the life of her main character, Lupita. The readers follow Lupita through her teen years, and glimpse her families\u2019 customs, faith, and love. Under the Mesquite meets all of the criteria for the Bulpre Award, but is most strongly shown through its interpretation of the theme or concept, development of a plot, and delineation of characters. \tMcCall writes this book in free-verse, which can be off-turning for some readers. However, the writing style provides succinct moments in Lupita\u2019s life, painting a word picture for the reader using vivid imagery and language to create the scene. The writing is peppered with Spanish terms which are appropriately placed for understanding. A Spanish term glossary is provided at the end of the book which provides a complete picture for the reader.\tThe plot is clearly represented in this book. Under the Mesquite is the story of a young girl, Lupita, as she moves from childhood to adulthood, taking on the challenges which develop when her mother becomes sick with cancer. Lupita is the oldest of 8 children and has a very close bond with her mother. She is an excellent student with the \u201cgift of words\u201d, which she uses in poetry and in stage performances. Lupita dreams of being the first in her family to go to college. When her mother is diagnosed with cancer, Lupita assumes the responsibility of the family while her father tends to her mother. This is a difficult task for Lupita and she battles with her own desire to still be a child while knowing she is at the age of womanhood in her family. The expectations which are put on Lupita are stressful, but she finds strength through her writing and her love for her mother. Lupita has to make decisions about the future she dreamed of having and what impact her decisions will have on her family. \tUnder the Mesquite is a coming of age novel with strong themes of family, strength, and responsibility. As one of the criteria for the Belpre Award, these themes are made very clear by the writing. Again, the free-verse style of this book provides focused attention to each moment which addresses one of these themes. The strong familial relationships are represented between Lupita\u2019s family in Texas and the grandparents, aunts, and cousins in Mexico through visits home, through the description of Lupita\u2019s adult role in the family once she is a senorita at age 15, and through pictures of Lupita as a young child helping to take care of her siblings. Lupita\u2019s strength is shown when she takes care of her siblings while her father goes to the hospital, when she is shunned by her friends for speaking \u201cwhite\u201d, and when she makes her decision to go to college and leave her family behind. Throughout the book, McCall draws the reader back to the responsibility Lupita, as the oldest child, has to her family, a responsibility which drives Lupita\u2019s decisions, heartache, stress, and sadness.\tMcCall develops a strong lead character in Lupita to whom all girls will be able to relate. Aside from this obviously strong character, the mother is presented with such wonderful characteristics of strength, love, wisdom, and faith, and is an example to Lupita throughout the book. At no point is Lupita trying to move away from a disappointment in her mother, rather, she strives to do all that her mother was able to do and envies the way her mother remained calm and peaceful all the time. Lupita struggles to take care of her 7 siblings, and marvels at her mother\u2019s abilities to do the same. \tI will be recommending Under the Mesquite to my students and definitely would want this on the shelves of my library. This book provides a level of cultural authenticity which provides insight into the Mexican culture which can be a starting point for further knowledge. The character\u2019s traits of strength and responsibility cross cultural lines and speak to all readers. This is the first book by McCall for young adults, but I will keep my eyes open for future titles she writes."}, {"userName": "Joella www.cinjoella.com", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2105254-joella-www-cinjoella-com", "userReview": "This is book 11 for the YALSA best books challenge. I can see why it was on my list twice (once for the Morris Award and once for the Best Fiction for Young Adults). This is a book of poetry (which also means quick read for those reluctant readers). Lupita is the oldest of eight kids. She was born in Mexico but her family moved to Los Estados Unidos when she was young. Although she often goes back to Mexico to visit her family there, she doesn't quite believe her parents when they tell her she has two homes. She feels like a transplanted Mexican girl in the United States. And to top it all off she hears The Secret that her parents have been hiding from her. Her mother has cancer and is very sick. It will take all that Lupita has to not only figure out who she is but to hold her family together as well. That is why she takes the time every day to write under the mesquite, a stubborn tree that is stronger than it looks.This was good. Lupita has a powerful voice and intense struggles. Each word is well chosen and echos her emotions well. The reader will feel the shock that Lupita has when her friends are cruel at lunch. Don't her friends know what she has been through and what she is doing? Why would they be so heartless when she is always on the verge of breaking down? Lupita states the harsh reality of what life is like when she has her father go to Houston with her mother. The desperate cunning to take care of and feed herself and her siblings was subtly mentioned and yet it magnified the character of who Lupita is and why the book was so powerful. Although there are not as many words as a traditional young adult book, the text sinks into the mind and won't let go of the reader's imagination...almost like the stubbornness of a mesquite growing in a garden of roses. Beautiful."}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "Lupita is the oldest of eight children, and just beginning high school. Born in Mexico, she and her parents immigrated to Texas when she was a six years old and have lived in Eagle Pass ever since. They are a close-knit family and Lupe does all she can as the oldest to help her mother care for the younger children. Like all teens she has to find her individual voice amid the cacophony of siblings, friends and relatives, and juggle the expectations of her parents, grandparents and teachers against her own passions and fears. When her mother is diagnosed with uterine cancer the illness will forever change the family relationships. Struggling to find her own path to adulthood, and taking on more responsibility as her mother\u2019s illness progresses, Lupita finds solace in writing poetry. This is a semi-autobiographical novel, written entirely in verse. Presented as a journal, the story follows Lupita as she deals with high school classes, friends and teachers who don\u2019t understand, and her desperate desire to support her mother and help her siblings as they all deal with the devastating news of Mami\u2019s cancer. Garcia McCall says so much with so few words! Her poetry is evocative and restrained, powerful and tender, vivid and elusive, full of sadness and joy, but mostly full of love. One quote:Waiting for la Muerte to take Mamiis like being bound,lying face up on the sacrificial altarof the god Huitzilopochtlipleading with the Aztec priest,asking him to be kindwhile he rips out my heart."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly", "userReview": "I liked the writing a lot here, as I think the verse actually served the story well. However -- and a big one -- the ending really left me a little disappointed because the entire book revolves around how Lupita gives up everything to take care of her family (her mom's got cancer and needs treatment) yet suddenly she decides to attend college. She's been writing and acting at school and she was passionate about both, but she didn't suggest to me she wanted more than that. My biggest issue came in that I never saw that outcome in the story line. There's not enough internal grappling with what Lupita wants for HERSELF, but rather, she's much more concerned about her mother and her family. It made the ending where she suddenly makes waves for herself feel a bit out of place. I wanted to believe it though because I think that was the ultimate message in the story, but it wasn't quite there. I never felt compelled to want Lupita to overcome where she was -- not because I thought she had it great (she didn't) but because she didn't make me believe SHE wanted more. She didn't offer enough insight into her own hopes and dreams because, while she made it clear her life wasn't easy, she also didn't pine for something for herself (she does for her mother, of course, but not herself). The story with her mother compounds this a bit. Good story and a quick read. One that would make an excellent readalike to Ashley Perez's WHAT CAN('T) WAIT."}, {"userName": "Sarah (YA Love)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2217993-sarah-ya-love", "userReview": "I'm not sure what I think of Under the Mesquite.

While it was a quick read, it lingered in my mind. I found myself continuing to think about it days after I'd finished it. It's a book that is certainly worth a second (or even third) read. The first time through I was engrossed in the story, only subconsciously aware of the beauty and simplicity of McCall's verse. When I returned to the novel later, I found myself incredibly moved by the imagery and sentiments conveyed through McCall's words. I think Lyn Miller-Lachmann describes it best in her own review: \". . .one of the most achingly beautiful novels I\u2019ve read in a long time. It is a story from the heart, not written to fit into a marketing category but to remember, to honor, and to bear witness.\"As many of you may already know, one of my favorite reads from the past year was Sammy & Juliana in Hollywood by Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz. To borrow Miller-Lachmann's words, it too, was achingly beautiful. I found myself reminded of Sammy & Juliana as I read Under the Mesquite. Both are poignant coming of age stories that refuse to sugar-coat the reality of their protagonists who have to grow up too quickly, shouldering responsibilities not meant for teenagers. Like Sammy, Lupita is strong--she struggles, but she is resilient. Often times our students learn too early that life isn't always fair, much like Lupita. Unfortunately, they're not always given the support or the knowledge to deal with it. Under the Mesquite offers an example of how to not only survive, but to eventually thrive. An important symbol throughout the story is the mesquite tree. No matter how hard Mami tries, she can't seem to get rid of the mesquite growing in her rose garden. Yet, by the end of the story, the mesquite has come to represent Lupita as she writes, I agree, but it isn't its beauty that strikes me. I envy the mesquite its undaunted spirit, its ability to turn even a disabling pruning into an unexpected opportunity to veer in a different direction, flourishing more profusely than before (p. 141).Lupita's strength doesn't just show in how she deals with the death of her mother, but also in how she navigates the difficult waters of identity. Lupita must struggle to determine for herself what it means to be a Mexican and a woman. When Lupita becomes involved in drama, her teacher Mr. Cort\u00e9s, suggests that they must work on getting rid of her Spanish accent. Yet, when Lupita does this, her identity as a Mexican is questioned by her closest friends: \"You talk like you're one of them.\" She spits out the word in disgust and looks down at her lunch tray, like she can't stand the sight of me. \"One of them?\" I ask. \"Let me translate for you,\" Sarita sneers. \"You talk like you wanna be white \". . . \"What,\" Sarita asks, \"you think you're Anglo now 'cause you're in Drama? You think you're better than us?\" \"No---\" \"Then stop trying to act like them,\" Mireya says accusingly. \"You're Mexican, just like the rest of us. . . \" (p. 80-81).But Lupita doesn't let others define her identity. Instead, she responds, Being Mexican means more than that. It means being there for each other. It's togetherness, like a familia. We should be helping one another, not trying to bring them down. . . . I'm not acting white! I want to shout after my so-called friends. I couldn't be more Mexican if you stamped a cactus on my forehead (p. 83).One of my favorite poetry sections is \"se\u00f1orita\" where Lupita describes the various ways her family members and friends define the significance of se\u00f1orita. Lupita must grapple with what it means for her, and the conclusions she arrives at reveal the ways in which Lupita has realized she must grown up. For Lupita, a se\u00f1orita . . .is the end of wild laughter. The end of chewing bubble gum and giggling over nothing with my friends at the movies, our feet up on the backs of the theater seats. . . .I'm trying my best to be a good daughter and accept the clipping of my wings, the taming of my heart. . . .Se\u00f1orita is a ni\u00f1a, the girl I used to be, who has lost her voice (p. 77).By the end of the story, the reader has experienced all four years of high school with Lupita. We see Lupita struggle to define herself as she deals the harsh realities of life, and we get to see her begin to heal and move on a stronger person. This is one of the reasons I think Lupita is such a powerful protagonist for our students. Lupita doesn't let the struggle defeat her: . . .at last I feel something unfurl within me. Like a shoot growing from what remains--a tiny piece of buried mesquite root-- determination flourishes (p. 194).I'm not alone in thinking Under the Mesquite is an amazing book--it is the winner of the 2012 Pura Belpr\u00e9 Author Medal, the 2012 William C. Morris Debut Award Finalist, and the 2013 Tom\u00e1s Rivera Children's Book Award. I hope you'll consider adding it to your classroom library.

New York: Lee and Low Books. 224 pp. ISBN: 978-1-60060-429-4. (Hardcover); $17.95.*Any time a book begins with a poem about a young girl creeped out about finding and holding her own umbilical cord, tesoro, I am hooked! These 47 poems tell the story of Lapita, a high school student trying to juggle school, friends, and family. Unfortunately her mother\u2019s cancer has her off balance and these juggled items come crashing down. McCall uses her Texas setting and Spanish language expertly. Mesquite trees belong in Texas and evoke two very different reactions: welcomed guest or uninvited pest, which serves as an appropriate metaphor for many Mexican Americans in Texas (and any other state). McCall pens images of a close family: Mami peeling potatoes, Papi teaching his young daughter how to write the letter S, and the eight children swimming or watching television or doing chores around the house. However, McCall often creates poems in which readers see both the love and the problem. My favorite example of this is in the poem, las telenovelas. In this poem Lapita and her mother are crying and sobbing over a television program featuring the suffering las mujeres who are able to cry on television without ruining their makeup. Mami is peeling potatoes and telling Lupita that she plans to watch her on one of these programs someday. This talk infuriates Papi who screams that is make-believe. Papi is home from his carpentry work and wants to watch something real, heavyweight boxing. Mami ends the poem by saying, \u201c\u00a1Ay s\u00ed! He wants to watch/ those big, beefy guys on television/ exchanging blows,/ like Muhammed Ali and/ George Foreman used to do,\u201d/ she whispers, \u201cNothing more/ realistic than that.\u201d (p. 64). This combination of the mundane family detail and the unrealistic expectations of both mother and father forces us to confront the sort of future that Lapita and her classmates should expect from society. This is really driven home a few poems later, to be or not to be/ mexican, when her school friends angrily accuse her: \u201cThen stop trying to act like/ them,\u201d Mireya says accusingly./ \u201cYou\u2019re Mexican, just like the rest of us./ Look around you. Ninety-nine percent/ of this school is Mexican./ Stop trying to be something you\u2019re not!\u201d (p. 81). All the while Lapita\u2019s mother is slowly dying. Her father has stopped working, money is in short supply, and Lapita finds herself trying to fill her beloved Mami\u2019s shoes\u2014and failing. Her school work plummets and her brothers and sisters wander off in their own direction. Lupita\u2019s family, which is an essential part of her life, is falling apart. This is where the mesquite tree comes to play, a tree that often has roots thicker than its trunk, a tree that defies all attempts to control it or kill it. \u201cPapi says the mesquite is nice to have./ He says someday/ when the eight of us kids are all grown/ and the tree is sturdy and tall,/ Mami will come to appreciate/ its simple beauty/ among her delicate roses.\u201d (p. 12) Lapita writes poems under the mesquite. She thinks about who she wants to be under the mesquite. In the end this mesquite tree provides the strength necessary for Lapita to see herself transplanted: Now, seeing the loose pages/ blowing around the parking lot/ like fallen leaves, I can\u2019t help/ but smile. I know what it\u2019s like/ to wish the wind would lift me up/ and transport me./ Someday my words will/ take flight and claim the sky. (pp. 206-207). A glossary of Spanish words and phrases accompanies this book, which will help monolingual readers. My volunteer work in a small neighborhood Latino library convinces me that this book is an honest look at some of the challenges faced by Mexican Americans. It is also a realistic look at the pressure teens face in school by a culture that often underestimates the family influence in many Mexican American families. While this book focuses on a specific Mexican American family, much of its punch is applicable to ANY teen family. Certainly cancer and school pressure and family problems are not the domain of any single group. Purchase this book for all high school and middle school libraries and take care to bring this book to the attention of both Spanish teachers and literature lovers."}, {"userName": "Maria Chavez", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12807413-maria-chavez", "userReview": "\u201cAfter everything that\u2019s happened and everything that hasn\u2019t, it hurts, but it also feel good to finally let Mami go.\u201d For 14 year-old Lupita it has not been easy being the oldest of 8 siblings, but she takes the tasks and responsibilities head on, especially when her mother is diagnosed with cancer. Told from Lupita\u2019s point of view, the story starts when Lupita is going to start her freshmen year in high school. Her family just moved to Eagle Pass, Texas from Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico since her Papi traveled a lot across the border for work. When the family becomes aware of Mami\u2019s cancer they use all the savings that her Papi had saved for her operation and chemotherapy. When Lupita\u2019s mom appears to be getting better and responding positively to the chemotherapy, Lupita\u2019s and her family\u2019s life goes back to normal. With the support of her teacher, Lupita has a chance to concentrate in her new interest in acting after joining drama in school. Just as easy as things start building back up they crumble back down when Papi informs his children that Mami\u2019s cancer has returned. In order to meet Mami\u2019s health needs, she and Papi move closer to a center that has everything Mami needs in order to get better. Papi agrees to leave his children with Lupita in charge. This time around though the chemotherapy is greatly weakening Mami and it eventually beats her. Lupita is very saddened and full of guilt about moving on without her mother. It isn\u2019t until she spends the summer with her Abuela Hortencia after she graduates that she comes to terms with what has happened in her life and hopes for what\u2019s in store and wants in the future. McCall\u2019s book is easy to read partly because it is set in six parts and each part is written in verse, which makes it really easy to follow along. Whenever the setting changes the reader is informed with a heading in each section. When you are reading you are able feel what Lupita is feeling and going through. The descriptions makes you feel like you are right there with Lupita and it makes it easy to connect and get into the book. Teachers should know about this book because it might be used as a motivation to look for what\u2019s to come in the future in spite of what is happening now or has happened in the past. This book might also help connect the students who are either the eldest of their siblings or have an older sibling. Students who are the eldest of their siblings might be able to connect with the book by thinking about how the responsibilities that Lupita has to face are similar and different to the ones they face. One possible theme that teacher might emphasize with this book in the classroom is coming of age. Like Lupita did by taking care of her siblings and staying strong and supporting her Papi when Mami became ill and eventually coming to the realization that she had to move on. All in all, Lupita takes us through a tough time in her life making McCall\u2019s book an emotional and hopeful story."}, {"userName": "MaryannP", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46988276-maryannp", "userReview": "This is a poetry novel about a young girl named Lupita and her family. Lupita is the oldest of 8 children and is a 14 year old freshman. She takes charge after her mom is diagnosed with cancer. She was born in Mexico, along with three siblings and moved to the U.S. with her family when she was six years old. Her four other siblings were born in the U.S. The dad is a central character in the story as he is the bread winner who works hard and works overtime to create savings accounts for each of his children. These savings accounts have to be used when he finds out that his wife has cancer of the uterus and needs to have surgery and chemo treatments every other week after surgery. The mother needs to go to a cancer clinic in Texas a year and a half later because the cancer returned. Her dad goes with her and Lupita is left all summer to take care of her siblings and the house. Lupita is now a junior in high school. The author shows us Lupita's struggles without telling us directly. Neighbors and some family members are helpful by bringing food over because they do not have any money, but they eventually feel like they have to beg for food because neighbors and family eventually stop bringing it and offering. They survive and their mom comes home in late August. She is very weak and tired, looking worse than when she left. She ends up back in the local hospital days/weeks later and passes away. This is hardship for all of the family, but we get a close look into how Lupita is feeling and overcoming it. She writes poems under the mesquite, all throughout her mothers chemo. The turning point is what she does with these poems at the end of the book. I like that this book mentions culture and uses the spanish language a little bit throughout the book, but describes the meanings of the words in a way that doesn't disrupt the reader. I also like when a spanish cognate is used, the author uses it as a replacement and doesn't tell the english word after it because we can figure it out. I also like that there are a lot of analogies used so we can feel what the characters are going through and understand the message without being directly told. This is a great book to teach middle school students about poetry, verse, and phrasing. It's also a great book to teach theme and characterization because there are a lot of thick characters in the book. I would recommend this book to be used in a poetry unit, book club, or whole class read aloud."}, {"userName": "may", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4988643-may", "userReview": "\"Someday my words willtake flight and claim the sky.\"\nLupina moved from Mexico to Los Estados Unidos when she was six year old.

That's what I like about Guadalupe Garcia McCall writing in this novel, she uses the verses not only to satisfy herself about her work but as a style reference to her main character. It's very symbolic for Lupina to write poetry under a mesquite. The tree is wise and full of life, the mesquite is a popular tree in Sounth America espacially in the Mexican desert, which show a part of how this family is traditional.Anyway this book blow me away.
