He is determined to put the past behind him but not everyone else is so quick to forget that he was accused of assault of a young woman. Neither are some people convinced that he was not the masked assailant or that he is innocence even though there was no evidence against him. Henry Lehmann however is not like most people. He gives Mark a job at his nursery where Waneta Cain also works. Despite her initial misgivings Waneta begins to see something more in Mark, believing he can rise above the harsh home environment Mark and his brother Calvin came from. Just when it seems things are starting to pick up Calvin, the brother he has not seen for years, arrives on town. When another woman is attacked, suspicion falls once again on Mark. I found this a good read. I liked hearing about the Amish way of life. Although there are assaults and attempted rape as well as domestic abuse it is all done tastefully. There is a level of tension throughout and my heart was beating like mad when the last assault takes place. I liked the way the narrative gave us the different thoughts of different people, like Mark, Waneta, and Calvin at times. One thing that did worry me a bit was how quickly Waneta\u2019s parents changed their attitude towards Mark after one sermon from the preacher Eli. I\u2019m not querying the change as such, just that it seemed a little too sudden. That aside, I enjoyed this story, liked the characters and the setting. Despite some red herrings, I always suspected who the real culprit of the attacks was. But that did not take away from my enjoyment of the novel. This is my first read by this author. Nothing said on my copy that it was part two in a series. It is easily read as a standalone. I also liked at the end the question and answer with a few of the Amish faith."}, {"userName": "Bj", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27341466-bj", "userReview": "4 \"Forgiveness as the Path to Love\" Stars.I have been meaning to try an Amish romance for quite some time now. Moreover, I'm a huge fan of romantic suspense titles, so when I read the blurb for His Guilt, I just knew I had to finally dive-in. If you're looking for a sweet romance that still has an edge of suspense/danger and exemplifies the collision between the morals and ways of the Amish and English (American, non-Amish religion observers) cultures, particularly when they live together in a relatively small community (a rural Kentucky town in this case), then look no further, as His Guilt is sure to satisfy your desire and tug at your heartstrings to boot.For those of you that are wondering if this book can be read as a standalone, it definitely can. Although its book 2 in The Amish of Hart County Series, I had no difficulty following either the romance or suspense plot as both seemed to be fully contained in this book.Mark Fisher left his home in an Amish community in Hart County after he was acquitted of an assault charge. When he inherits his family home several years later though, he decides to return home and try to resurrect his life. Unfortunately, for Mark, even though he was found to be innocent by a court of law, not all of the town's inhabitants are quite so forgiving. Fortunately for Mark though, his mentor who owns a nursery in town, believes in his innocence and offers him a job. Moreover, his co-worker at the nursery, Waneta Cain, who has always been highly regarded in the Amish community (as a good and proper Amish girl) also believes that her religion requires her to forgive Mark and give him a second chance. This leads to a budding friendship between them that is also characterized by something more--and it doesn't take long for her family to encourage Mark's attentions on Waneta, including courting her in a sweet manner, consistent with the Amish tradition. When more brutal assaults happen in town, however, Mark's moral character is once again challenged. Further complicating matters is the reappearance of Mark's now \"English\" younger brother who clearly has made some trouble-filled decisions in his life. Will Waneta stand by Mark's side under the circumstances? Is she even safe as long as she continues to engage him? Moreover, who is behind these brutal attacks, and why?One aspect of this story that I really enjoyed was the intermixing of faith and its connection to trust, hope and love. It's definitely an inspiring story that even persons who have had a rough past, have a chance to turn their lives around and find their own love and happiness.Source: Review copy provided for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Carrie Schmidt (Reading is My SuperPower)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084197-carrie-schmidt-reading-is-my-superpower", "userReview": "Shelley Shepard Gray knows how to deliver thrilling Amish suspense with a touch of romance and a dash of humor!Gray\u2019s Amish characters aren\u2019t part of a bonnet-and-straw-hat-wearing utopia. Instead, they are realistically flawed and delightfully human. The good, the bad, and the ugly all get some page time, and we can learn more than a thing or two about ourselves in the process. Domestic abuse, substance abuse, assault, attempted rape, prejudice, and gossip are addressed with grace and dignity \u2013 and countering them all is kindness and faith. Waneta and Mark are written with such heart and personality that they will quickly feel like friends, and you will be fully invested in how their story plays out.The suspense angle in His Guilt is both chilling and heartwrenching. When I thought I had it figured out, Gray would write a scene with just the right amount of vagueness to make me question my astute sleuthing skills.

It is still written in Ms. Grays's innocent, sweet style, so fans shouldn't be too worried about this venture. And even though this is the second book in the series, it stands alone, but fans won't want to miss Her Secret--the first book of the series. There are a couple of red herrings in this story, but never the less, I did figure out who-dun-it almost right away. It was fairly obvious to me although Ms. Gray did a good job trying to cast doubt about Mark and even another male character. I got an advance reader copy for review, so I know errors are to be expected, but there were many inconsistencies in the version I read. I hope they were found and corrected in the final copy. Waneta is a sweet, innocent girl, and Mark--though he tries to act otherwise--is a sweet, innocent boy. Fans of Ms. Gray will likely love this newest series of hers.

An unusual combination for an Amish novel and I love the edginess Gray brings to her story. It's full of imperfect characters making flawed decisions that have far reaching ramifications. Lots of juicy, gnarly stuff that makes you think and squirm and come away a better person.Even in this tight-knit Amish community, Mark can't escape the shadow of his past. It doesn't matter that he's not guilty of any wrong doing if everyone still thinks he is. Prejudice fuels gossip and soon he's second guessing his return to Hart County. But for the kindness and faith of a few, he'd be truly lost.The gossip ensnares Neeta, and she struggles to separate fact from fiction as she begins to develop a friendship with Mark. Wary. Confused. Feeling pulled in two directions, it takes awhile for Neeta to see the truth and gain the confidence to stand by it.Shelley Shepard Gray once again brings inspiration and hope into the lives of characters facing real and raw issues.

Author Gray jumps right into the heart of the story and the characters of Mark Fisher and Neeta Cain. I will admit that at first I was not sure of Mark and his motives. He acted abruptly and brusquely and not until I received the story from his perspective did I even try to really like him. Like Neeta and others, I was wary of his character. However the author was able to show him and his struggles in such a light that he became a much cherished character.This story definitely delves into a different Amish tale. Here the community is not at a peace as a young woman was beaten and murdered some years ago. Everything seems to be on the upswing and people have started to let down their guard until Mark and others who were somewhat outcasts in their Amish community return home. There is an evil in the town as more young women fall prey to the attacker and no one is safe. There were many ways this story could have gone and the author keeps us in suspense the whole time.

What a tense book! I liked the two main characters, Mark and Neeta. Mark and his brother suffered a lot growing up. I felt sorrow for him and a lot of frustration in regards to how most of the community treated him, both in the past and the present. Their small-minded attitude toward him was hard to read about, but made for some excellent tension and situations to develop in the book.This novel had some very intriguing characters in it. Quite a few of them had to take a look back at their pasts in order to decide how they were going to allow that to affect their future.

There will be some that will enjoy this book and others the define everything through a black and white microscope might think differently. This is a series unlike anything that falls under the Amish genre, and for someone looking for a bit of suspense in solving a murder mystery, then this is the series for you. It will have you glued to the book until the final page is turning hoping that this doesn't leave you in a cliff-hanger for the third novel and rest assured, you will have all the answers by the last page. Which leads me to ask the question, what will the third novel cover? Guess we will have to sit back and bide our time til it releases. His Guilt is the second novel in the Amish of Hart County Series with Her Secret being the first. Please read them in order to gain the most satisfaction in understanding where the second novel picks up. Mark Fisher returns back to Hart County, where he and his brother Calvin shared a less than normal Amish upbringing. Suffering at the hands of an abusive alcoholic father, and a mother that seemed to wish both boys were not hers, Calvin and Mark both left to find new futures some place else. Now that Mark Fisher has returned and is trying to find a new future now that his parents have passed away, leaving him the family home to restore, he struggles to fit into the community that is resolved to hold his past against him. He was questioned before in the assault of Bethany Miller, but was released when they could find no evidence to convict him. However most in the Amish community would rather have Mark Fisher leave and never come back. They are quite so willing to find forgiveness in their hearts. Waneta Cain, a young Amish woman tries to see things from a different perspective along with his employer and great friend, Mr. Lehmann who all work for Blooms and Berries. But when a murder happens, suddenly all eyes look for Mark Fisher, who once again seems to be the focus of this investigation. As more and more violence escalates in the community, members of Hart County seem convinced that Mark is the one to blame, but is he or is there something more sinister happening in the community that no one notices until it is too late? I received His Guilt by Shelley Shepard Gray compliments of Avon Inspire, a division of Harper Collins Publishers and Litfuse Publicity. This is one of the best suspense murder mystery series, I have read to date and love how Shelley doesn't give it all away until the very end as police investigations find the real guilty person, and it is not who I thought it was. It reminds you that too often we judge people based not only on their appearances, but also holding their past against them as well. When do we let people try and make a better future for themselves without our judging their actions of the past? For me, this one is worth all 5 out of 5 stars in this reader's opinion and can't wait for the third novel in the series to release."}, {"userName": "LeAnne Klopfenstein", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43316363-leanne-klopfenstein", "userReview": "His Guilt is the second novel in the Amish of Hart County series, but it definitely stands on its own as a suspenseful, well-developed, and independent work of fiction! The main characters in this second novel are Mark Fisher and Waneta Cain, who were not prominently featured in Her Secret. Author Shelly Shepard Gray shows her writing expertise by creating yet another Christian Amish Fiction series that manages to tie the novels together and still allow them to stand alone.I don't like to read reviews that give away the entire plot of a novel, nor am I willing to write them. As the key characters, Mark seeks a fresh start by returning to his childhood home. Wanetta has never left home and begins to see her world view expand as she starts to grasp the complexities that surround Mark's past, his present, and what it means to truly accept others. While the journey isn't easy, Wanetta truly 'puts her stake in the ground' as she stands up for what is right, stands against the false accusations from the past that still affect Mark, and puts into action what it means to be a true friend. In turn, Mark must learn to balance standing on his own yet accept friendship, kindness, and acceptance when it's offered. *I received a copy of this book from the publisher, but was under no obligation to write a review.

Mark, Waneta, Calvin (Mark's brother), and Lora are some of the most complex characters I have come across in an Amish novel - none of them are completely likable at times (including Waneta who can be a bit sanctimonious at times - luckily she changes as the book goes on). Mark too is flawed - he comes from a troubled background which is heartbreaking to read but you can't help but cheer him on while reading the book. There are two romances in this novel - both are done well and are fun to watch develop. My one \u201ccomplaint\u201d is that both romances happen very fast - everything is neatly wrapped up in about six weeks. The mystery of who is attacking Amish woman adds a nice bit of tension to the novel and makes for some thrilling moments towards the end of the book but astute readers will quickly figure out who the attacker is.Shelley Shepherd is a talented writer and this is a very enjoyable Amish romance.

And a suspenseful thriller.These books are a fast read for me. I am swept in to the story.The romance and the conflict kept me riding the wave until the very end. His Guilt is the 2nd in a the series. The topic of the story isn't what I typically expect in a story about the Amish. I expect sweet romance with good kind hearted folk. This is not what Shelley gives the reader. For the most part the characters are good kind hearted and God fearing. But she writes 'real life' and 'real life drama'. His Guilt is a story about abuse. Women are being attacked and abused. For me I couldn't help but think it was sad. I think I try to tell myself that there are places that are wholesome and free of pain, hurt and crime. But I realize that place only exists in the here after. The stories in this series are about pain and hurt and crime. But they are about love and hope and redemption. I enjoyed all the characters. The main characters are able to get beyond their pasts and fall in love and live happily ever after.I liked Marks brother and hope to see him maybe in a different series. After leaving home at 14 he got into trouble. Years later when he returns his trouble follows. An causes some to speculate that he's possible the villain. In the end he's grown into a strong man with a little help from Mark and Lori. (they knew each other in high school). And with some help from the local police he leaves town and goes under cover. Sounds like a great new series may be in the works. We can hope!I liked many of the sub characters and am glad to see that Lori and Deputy Beck get together too and make an appearance in book 3.Shelley provides some feedback and questions at the end and an excerpt from book 3. His Guilt is a good and clean romance. It is a bit of a thriller and the crime(s) make this a book one that I would suggest parents read before allowing an older teen to read. A parental discussion might be warranted. (No language. Nothing overly graphic.) Very tastefully written. Readers of romance would really like this book and book 1 in the series.

She never fails to grip me wholly and keep me in the center of the story. This book, just like Her Secret, was an instant gripper for me.\n\nOnce again, the characters were captivating for me. I loved Mark and Waneta both. Mark's character really tugged at me the most. I can't imagine the pain that he endured through life. The things he dealt with in life, you don't imagine being a part of an Amish novel, but it was and it really made it that much more gripping. Oh to be there! I would go in mama mode on him and hug him big! Waneta's character, well, she was a little too judgy at times, but seeing God work on her, really made me love her that much more.\n\nThis book is intriguing, emotional, and gripping. It is not a sweet Amish romance, but it is a wonderful Amish novel in a series that will steal your heart, just the same. You will go through the roller coaster ride of ups and downs as you fall in love with each character, as you feel each characters emotions,as they seek forgiveness,and the pain that they go through of letting go of the past. Anything less than a 4.5 star review will not do this book justice.\n\nI definitely recommend this book to all Amish fiction lovers, but be warned. It is not a light hearted read.

Because of this we all fall under the same guidelines as far as God goes and how we were all created. With that being said, we all have the ability in us to do bad things. In the Amish community, they seem to be a people that find it very hard to trust someone again, especially when that someone has had to pay his debt to society. Mark Fisher finds this all out to be true because after his return to Hart county, he is not being as well received as he would of liked. He returns at the request of a friend but he isn't relishing the idea of the disapproval from others in the community. When Mark returns and things start to make him look guilty--he just wants to run but running means he will have to leave love behind and hes not so sure he is ready to part ways so easily.  Neeta and Mark are perfect for each other and that is plain to see. As always, the authors writing hits the spot and she pulls off another love story that is against all odds.

Though it\u2019s part of a series, it is a completely different story. You can definitely read it as a standalone. His Guilt deals with the pressure of growing up in a small town, then staying there as an adult. While the story deals with the heavy topics of physical abuse and even death. There\u2019s also a deeper message of acceptance and forgiveness. Main character Mark is a prickly sort of man. It was hard to like him at first because he was so determined to pick a fight! Several other characters came across very strong, yet as the story went on, they changed in a variety of ways. Throwing stones at another person\u2019s reputation can have such devastating consequences.Although I enjoyed His Guilt, it wasn\u2019t my favorite title from Gray. So many hints and obvious clues were given, I was tempted to skip right to the end to confirm my suspicions. The dialogue didn\u2019t seem genuine\u2026I couldn\u2019t imagine actual adults carrying on these conversations. Keep in mind that I received an uncorrected proof, so the finished copy may show significant improvements. For me, the appeal of the series is that it\u2019s based in central Kentucky. There were discussions about the geography of the area (Horse Cave, for example) that made the story more interesting. Also, Gray deserves recognition for addressing the hot-button issues of domestic abuse and general physical abuse, as well as public stigma that defies the \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d stance.

When given the chance to join this book tour with Litfuse Publicity group I jumped at the chance to read an Amish Fiction book by this New York Times best selling author. But I realized quickly it was the second in a series called \u201cThe Amish of Hart County\u201d and I\u2019d need to snag the first book Her Secret. I was delighted with that book on audio, I borrowed it through the application called Overdrive and devoured it. That left me weeks out from the arrival of Gray\u2019s newest installment. I was so excited when it arrived and it too was a quick, intense, and engaging read.What I liked most was that while this is Amish Fiction, which is what initially drew me to the series, it was different. Many Amish Fictions are centered on faith, romance, and are also very upbeat. In fact these descriptors are exactly why I often select them as my light reading in the summer \u2013 simply to keep up my reading speed and to transport me out of reality. However, these books also did this and in a whole new way. An unexpected way! Delving into mystery, crime, and a bit more reality, I found myself really enjoying this fresh look at how Amish culture may handle real world issues. I really enjoyed this different approach to exploring Amish culture. It was intriguing to read about how crime may affect the Amish and how it so completely clashes with everything they stand for. It also gives you the dose of reality that even in a removed sub culture like the Amish have created they too face daily, real issues like crime. While Her Secret dealt directly with stalking, His Guilt was a totally different kind of crime and mystery.This really was the perfect summer read for me. I was surprised that the characters did not overlap between the two books. Usually that\u2019s what I enjoy most about a series like this one is that a minor character in the first book will become a major character in the next. While that was not the case with these two books the links are clear (crime theme) and the topics are what make them flow as a series. I do think you could read one without reading the first and still thoroughly enjoy the story and not miss a beat.His Guilt was one I really couldn\u2019t put down, and with three kids in tow and one more on the way that says a lot. I took it camping with me, it went everywhere with me, including in my purse. Hence the very damaged cover by the time I was finished. I really am looking forward to hearing what you all think of this one! Even if Amish Fiction just isn\u2019t your thing, the amount of Deutsch language (the Amish speak either Pennsylvania Dutch or Pennsylvania German) is minimal. Often Amish fiction is peppered with words in their dialect and that can make it more challenging for a new to Amish Fiction reader \u2013 that is not the case with this novel. Plus the book really is a quick and engaging read that isn\u2019t so complex that you couldn\u2019t pick it up and put it down frequently still following the storyline easily and enjoying the mystery, suspense, and bit of romance in the story. I am really looking forward to the next book (The Gift expected in early November of 2017) in the series and this one just came out!"}, {"userName": "Chastity Ray", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26697771-chastity-ray", "userReview": "His Guilt is the second book in Shelley Shepard Gray's Amish of Hart County series. Even though it can be read as a stand alone I highly recommend reading the series.Waneta Cain loves her job at Blooms and Berries nursery. She enjoys meeting people and helping them pick out just the right plants and trees for their needs. She has never really given much thought to how she does her job, but with the new guy, Mark, staring a hole in her she's beginning to wonder what he finds so fascinating. Instead of feeling flattered she's beginning to feel like prey. What is this guy's problem?Mark Fisher can't help but stare at Waneta. She's so open and friendly with everyone else but has barely said two words to him all day. Growing up Mark didn't come from the best home and then as a teenager he was taken in for questioning when a woman was assaulted. Even though he was found innocent some people can't seem to get past the fact he was a suspect in the first place. Surely Waneta couldn't be like them, she has always been so kind and caring, well until now.His Guilt is a story about love and forgiveness. Do we truly love others or do we hold their past against them? Waneta is forced to ask herself these questions when Mark points out how differently she treats him compared to others. Ashamed of herself, she makes a promise to herself, she is going to give Mark the benefit of the doubt and get to know him better.Mark feels like the biggest heal. Why can't he just keep his mouth shut? Did he really need to call Waneta out like that? He can't really blame her for thinking the worst of him. I mean, look where he came from but still, he doesn't want her to be afraid to talk him. After Waneta agrees to give him a chance he's hopeful about the future. But when attacks start to happen to other women he wonders if he will ever be able to live in Hart County in peace.I love all of Shelley Shepard Gray's books. She has a unique way of crafting a story that will touch in you in a way you never expected. I'm typically not a fan of mystery and intrigue but I fell in love with His Guilt. I love that it's a redemptive story. Mark may not have had the best start in life and trouble may follow him where ever he goes, through no fault of his own, but he is determined not to let his past define him. Waneta tries to treat everyone with respect but when Mark pointed out that she was treating him differently because of his past, she had to take a hard look at herself. She chose to practice what she preached, so to speak, and stand up for Mark when nobody else would.Bad things are happening all around them. Will their budding friendship hold up when once again Mark's past comes back to haunt him? Or will things fall apart and force Mark to leave Hart County for good?If you're looking for the perfect summer read or if you've never read one of Shelly Shepard Gray's books before I hope you will give His Guilt a try. I believe you will love it as much as I do!Here's what other's have to say:http://litfusegroup.com/author/SGray* I was provided a free copy of this book.

Mark has returned after a two-year absence to his family\u2019s home after the death of his father. Mark\u2019s younger brother has been gone from the Amish community for ten years, so Mark lives alone. Mark is having a tough time being around most of the community because they still believe he is guilty of attacking a young Amish woman two years ago, even though the police declared him innocent. He is now back and people seem to fear him or hate him. Waneta Cain is no exception at first. He knows she is afraid of him, so he keeps her at a distance. He would like her friendship, but he will make it on his own if he must.Waneta Cain is afraid of Mark at first, but quickly realizes she has found him guilty of a crime he didn\u2019t commit so she extends the branch of friendship. They begin a tentative friendship with Waneta defending Mark against verbal attack from a couple of her friends. Then, a young woman is attacked and Mark is immediately suspected. Waneta still believes in his innocence. Then, another young woman is attacked and the police can\u2019t seem to find any clues to the attacker. Meanwhile Mark\u2019s younger brother has returned to town and is in trouble with a gang. He needs money and hopes Mark will sell the family home and split the proceeds. Mark, however, has other plans for the home and his relationship with his brother remains abrasive.My only negative about this story is that I wish it had more of a mystery element to it. While there was a mystery in this story, it was fairly easy to figure out the culprit. Other than that, I did enjoy watching the romance bloom between Mark and Waneta. She seemed meek and mild, but when defending someone she cared about\u2026look out! She was strong in her defense. Mark was a young man with a troubled and abusive past, but he tried his best not to abandon God like most of the people of the town had abandoned him. He remained faithful to God and he received blessings. These two characters had to learn to communicate with each other and not assume what the other was thinking. A good lesson for anyone, myself included.

Like many of the author's books, His Guilt, the second book in The Amish of Hart County series leaves me elated with having read a very satisfied read, but with the question of figuring out which one of the author's is my favorite. I'm particularly fond of this series with its cryptic suspense, flawed characters and the secondary theme of gossiping and its ramifications.\"I think you are being judgmental. You are casting stones without a care about who they hurt. . .\" (60)As the past haunts our main character Mark, gossip and standing up for what (and who) she believes in marks Neeta's struggles in His Guilt. How easily are we affected by hearsay or easily we conclude that we know about a person based on their past or what the majority thinks? It's easy to point fingers or feel victimized, but what if you're the one behind all the gossip or what if your past casts a dark cloud over you constantly? I closed the last page of His Guilt with more than elation of having a satisfied conclusion, but a desire to look into my heart and be wary of my action and thoughts. Isn't that what makes a good story - when it gives a reader more than just a story, but meaning?\". . . memories hurt, but I don't want them to define me.\" (75) \"There's a big world out there. It is filled with pain and hurt. . . But it's also filled with opportunities and wonderful people. And love. If you dare to step out of your prison.\" (191)There's a certain amount of darkness shown that's quite different than typical Amish fiction. Scenes of physical abuse described and possible rape mentioned. Yet, it was written in a way that holds true to its genre, as well as for readers looking for realism in fiction. In all, His Guilt gives a whole new meaning to how words can hurt, how trust and faith heals and forgiveness relieves the tension that burdens deep into one's soul. Sometimes, the romance plays second fiddle, and that's fine, because simplicity still shines at the right moments.\" '. . . You mean something to me.' She didn't know whether to give him a hug or burst into tears. His words were heartfelt.\" (145)This review first appeared on Just Commonly blog.Disclaimer: I received an ARC of this book from the author/publisher.

I loved the intrigue in the story and found myself so engrossed that I blocked everything around me out. The author has once again delivered a story that kept me emotionally invested and on edge of my seat at the same time. Her writing style is filled with details that made me feel the story was playing out right in front of me. Each scene took on a vivid picture and placed readers right in front viewing the story with anticipation. Waneta is a wonderful character. She is fair, hardworking and filled with faith. Some people may think she is stuck up but once you get to know her, you sense her sincerity and compassion. I loved her relationship with her parents and how they represented a family of unconditional love. She is a great worker and loves helping others. Mark has come back to town after being away for awhile. Oh my this character tugged on my heart so much. His upbringing was horrible and painful. The many beatings and lack of food and clothing that his parents made him and his little brother endure was very hard to read. As kids they suffered as others picked on them and made fun of them. The author did an amazing job of writing about child abuse with grace and allowed readers to see how damaging it can be to a child. I loved how Mark showed courage when he returned after being accused of hurting a girl. Even though he was found innocent , will the town accept him? One of the great things about his character is that he has continued in his faith. I thought the friendship between Mark and Waneta was so special . As she realizes that she has been judging Mark, she knew God was directing her to be Mark's friend and to show forgiveness. One of the best parts of the story is when Mark is struggling with acceptance and learning to forgive himself. Will Waneta be able to help Mark and show him that real friends never never up? Overcoming his childhood is painful and his desire to make a better life for himself was incredible to read. I loved his determination and willingness to not give up. When another woman is attacked, the townspeople start gossiping and spreading rumors. All to quickly Mark seems to be at the center of the investigation. Can Mark prove his innocence? Will Waneta stick by him? Who is abusing women in the community? Don't miss this exciting book that takes a look at childhood abuse, domestic violence and allows God's grace to turn judgment and fear into forgiveness and trust. \"We all need to stop judging others and casting stones. We also need to seek forgiveness.\" I received a copy of this book from LitFuse.

You just have to love a man who will lay it all down for his woman, to protect her and keep her safe. This is what Amish man, Mark Fisher does. He has some past baggage which he is trying to set aside. He decides to go home to Hart County after being accused of assault two years before. That is when he left his community. The author immediately has you wondering if Mark was guilty or wrongly accused? Why didn't he stay and fight if he was innocent? There is one person who makes him want to make his life right and that is pretty Waneta Cain, Neeta. She believes in him and knows deep down he didn't commit the crime. Neeta has a problem with Mark's worldliness that he has taken on since gone from the community. He actually came back to help someone who had helped him but there's a different reason he wants to stay.Things are going better until, yes, there's always that but or until. A close friend of Neeta is attacked. Who do you think everyone is looking to as the one who attacked her, yes, Mark. Neeta starts to have doubts about Mark. Is the man he's become the man she wants in her life? This hurts Mark more than the accusations. But another attack occurs and this time it's someone close to both of them. Will Neeta be the next victim? Mark thinks he knows who it is but can he convince everyone it isn't him, it's someone else? Will Neeta stay by his side? Will there be a chance for a new life for both Neeta and Mark? The author puts you in the role of detective to figure out who is committing these assaults. You have to feel for Mark and also, Neeta. Neeta is being put in the position of believing in the man she wants so desperately to have a relationship with and trying to deal with his worldly ways.A different twist on the Amish read and it worked out real well. Well written with good descriptions of scenes and characters. Mark and Neeta are people you would like to know,almost as if you do know them in a way. So if you like Amish reads, try this one, it is different than most and you won't want to put it down until it's finished. Even then, you're left wanting more, much more.I received a copy of this book from the author and Litfuse Publicity Group and voluntarily decided to review it."}, {"userName": "Amy Fields", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36109830-amy-fields", "userReview": "I really enjoy Amish fiction but when an author does something different with the story I take notice.

It was interesting to see how someone would come back from being thought guilty of a horrific crime to trying to fit in with a community again and show they were innocent. Gossip is a terrible thing and has a life of its own and that was really shown here as Mark's constantly accused of things and looked at with suspicion because of his past. I found it surprising and frustrating how some people could be so judgmental and sure that he was guilty of everything when they had no proof and even knew he had been cleared of the past crime. Neeta ended up losing friendships over this attitude because she stood up for him and they didn't want to hear it. I also found it interesting to see how Mark reacted to the situation and to different relationships in his life because of his childhood and the unpredictability and neglect he suffered. He had a hard time opening up to people and sometimes reacted in negative ways. I was somewhat surprised by some advice his preacher gave him. Most was good, but there was something he said that seemed out of character for a Christian. I liked the different conversations about forgiving, not judging, second chances and looking beneath the surface. I was really surprised that Neeta's parents, Mark and her boss weren't more worried about her biking to and from work by herself after 2 attacks and when she herself had been threatened, though I don't think she ever told her parents about that. I also thought she was very naive about an incident that happened. I was also a little surprised at Mark for something he does at the end of the story. Other than those instances, I really liked both her and Mark. There's talk of prayer, forgiveness and knowing God was with her. There's a little bit of romance and some suspense. I thought it worked well as a stand-alone, though it's book two. I would recommend this story if you like Amish books or suspense.I received this book free from Litfuse Publicity in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Christian Fiction Addiction", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7431278-christian-fiction-addiction", "userReview": "Be prepared to encounter the Amish community in a manner like you probably haven't before! \"His Guilt\" explores what happens when gossip takes over a community and people judge each other based on fear and assumptions, with long-term negative consequences. My heart immediately went out to Mark for his difficult past and the unjust way in which people treat him. Although he's not perfect, which of us is? He certainly doesn't deserve the judgemental attitude that people greet him with. At first I wasn't totally sold on Neeta based on her actions, but soon I came to appreciate her determination to change her behaviour and treat Mark as God calls her to treat her neighbours.The plot of this novel flows along at a solid pace, and Gray throws in some twists into the story that will keep you caught up in the story. Even though you may guess fairly quickly who is actually behind the attacks that have occurred in the past and present, if you are like me the real suspense lies in how Mark is being targeted and how that plays out. The way that Mark and Neeta's relationship gently unfolds in the midst of the prejudice enveloping him makes for interesting and genuine romance. Ultimately, it was the themes of forgiveness and second chances that I most loved about \"His Guilt\", not only in Mark and Neeta's story, but actually in Lora and Eddie as well (a story line I almost wished had been its own novel it was so intriguing to watch unfold!)\"His Guilt\" will no doubt capture your heart with the likeable characters, the sense of justice that prevails, and the satisfying ending that will leave you with a smile on your face.

After all, it is the site of the worst time in his life. Once upon a time in Hart County, he was falsely accused of assault, and he fled in order to put the past, the county and all its people behind him in order to live a better life. It is only when a friend, the only friend he had who helped him back in Amish-land, needs him that Mark decides to return. What he wasn\u2019t expecting, however, was to fall for a very pretty girl by the name of Waneta (Neeta) Cain. The girl has a good head on her shoulders and does not believe that the now worldly Mark has an evil bone in his body. She certainly doesn\u2019t believe the gossip that still lingers regarding his supposedly violent past. But when her own friend is brutally attacked, some of that awful gossip starts to invade her psyche. Mark feels like his heart is breaking when Neeta goes from happy to acting very wary around him. He wants to beg her, make her realize that he is not capable of assault and would never even raise a hand to a woman. But when another in the community is attacked suddenly Mark believes he knows exactly who has been doing this all along. He finds that he has two choices: He can run once again, which will solidify in Neeta\u2019s mind that he is guilty. Or, he can stay and fight, unveiling the real predator, clearing his name, and making sure that Neeta does not face the brutality that others already have.Romantic suspense is definitely the category for this one, and the author delivers a highly emotional thriller that will have every reader going \u2018back in time\u2019 to get the first book in this, The Amish of Hart County series."}], "description": "New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Shelley Shepard Gray delivers the next novel in her Amish of Hart County series\u2014a suspenseful tale of an Amish man who will risk all to protect the woman he loves.Mark Fisher has returned home to Hart County, determined to put the past behind him.
