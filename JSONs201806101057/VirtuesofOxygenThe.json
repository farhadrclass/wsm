One of them, Holly, is a 42-year-old widow with two teenage sons. She works at the local newspaper in Bertram Corners, a two-hour drive from New York City. She struggles with finances, trying to keep up mortgage payments on her home and survives only with the assistance of her wealthy mother. Holly volunteers as one of the assistants to Vivian, the other main character. Vivian is a 63-year-old quadriplegic; she contracted polio and has spent the last 57 years in an iron lung and is totally dependent on others for 24-hour care. The two have become good friends over the years. Part of the novel is narrated using the third person limited omniscient point of view, focusing on Holly. Periodically, Vivian\u2019s first person narration is included in the form of her unaired podcasts. It is these podcasts which I found most interesting. Providing the viewpoint of a woman who describes herself as \u201csomeone alive but trapped like a fly in tree sap\u201d is original. Vivian tells her life story in these podcasts, explaining how she coped and made a life for herself despite her extreme circumstances. I found myself wishing her story were more developed.Holly\u2019s story I found much less interesting. Her situation, trying to provide for her sons and to make ends meet, is one with which many people could identify. It is sometimes difficult to have sympathy for her, however, because, though her financial situation worsens, she has not done much to help herself and her family, relying on her wealthy mother to help her pay the mortgage. It is only when her mother can no longer help that Holly seems to realize the severity of her financial straits. Only then does she fear losing the house and not having the money for her sons\u2019 college tuition? Even then, she only panics and does little constructive to help the situation. She is the damsel in distress awaiting a knight in shining armour to rescue her.A stranger does come riding into town. Vivian decides to invest in a cash-for-gold store and Holly serves as her assistant, meeting with Racine, the man who has set up a number of these stores. As expected, a relationship develops between Holly and Racine, but it consists primarily of Holly running away after dates and Racine mysteriously leaving town. Since little information is given about Racine, the relationship hardly seems grounded. The plot is weak. Some events are totally predictable; for example, when Holly\u2019s mother\u2019s engagement ring goes missing, we know exactly where it will show up. There are a lot of convenient coincidences; for example, everyone in Holly\u2019s family suffers financial setbacks at the same time. Inclement weather always seems to cause a power outage? And then there are the unbelievable events. Vivian studied the stock market and built a financial portfolio, going from penny stocks to blue chips, and is described by her broker as having the Midas touch so she is able to invest $120,000 in a business. But then this same woman learns that \u201c\u2019most of my investments are basically worthless right now\u2019\u201d?The novel examines society\u2019s relationship with money. The author makes a parallel between oxygen and money: \u201cIf money were oxygen, [Holly] was the one flopping around like a fish outside the iron lung. Society expected people to have money. It really didn\u2019t know what to do with people who found themselves outside the norms of earning and spending and paying taxes.\u201d Unfortunately, the resolution to Holly\u2019s financial problems weakens the realism of the novel\u2019s thematic development.This book is a quick read. I just wish that the focus had been more on Vivian\u2019s story rather than on Holly\u2019s.

Just an \"okay\" read for me. The story of two women whose lives intertwine but I was only interested in one story - Vivian's, a polio survivor living in an iron lung. Holly's story, a widow with two children trying to make ends meet, didn't resonate that much with me even though I was sympathetic to her plight. The book does have some glimmers of touching moments and insight into the value of a life lived in an iron lung - hence, \"The Virtues of Oxygen\". It is an aptly titled book!"}, {"userName": "Dana ****Reads Alot****", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063591-dana-reads-alot", "userReview": "I could not put this book down. The friendship between Vivian and Holly was so touching and extraordinary. Funny how close they both were really never knew each others struggles until almost the very end.Holly was a widow raising two boys and trying to keep things afloat with house payments and struggling. Her mother had helped her keep her house and when the unthinkable happens her mother suffers a heart attack and never really recovers. Her siblings decide to place her in a nursing home where all her savings will be drained. Thats when the siblings find out she has been helping Holly all along. They were angry because they were having their own problems. And could of used some help also.Vivian living in the iron lung was my hero. She fought her battles with her conditions from contracting polio at an early age. She fought every step of the way to make a livable life for herself but in the end she just could not do it anymore. What these two friends do for one another is what real friendship and loyalty and love is about. This a must read . I cried a few times.I will definitely be reading more of Susan Schoenberger's books."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001837-marlene", "userReview": "Originally published at Reading RealityThe Virtues of Oxygen is the story of two women (and a town) who are all having difficulty with something that is critical to survival.It\u2019s not that Holly started out life somewhere in the upper-middle class and feels deprived because her standard of living has steadily fallen throughout her adult life--it\u2019s that she\u2019s 42, widowed young, with two sons and a job in a dying industry (journalism) in a small town that has been losing economic ground for decades.She works hard and she does her best, but she\u2019s going to lose her house. And her little weekly newspaper is about to fold, taking her job with it.Then her mother has a severe stroke and she and her siblings have to face even more bitter truths. Their mother survived, but she will never get better. The woman they knew is gone.And everything that their parents saved in their life together will have to go to taking care of the body that no longer houses their mother.Holly says that money is like oxygen, and she just doesn\u2019t have enough. but Holly\u2019s friend Vivian really doesn\u2019t have enough actual oxygen. Ever.230px-Iron_lung_CDCVivian is 65, and she contracted polio when she was 6--three years before the Salk vaccine. For the past 59 years, Vivian has lived her entire life in an iron lung. She can\u2019t breathe without it\u2019s constant assistance.She has managed to make a life for herself. Computers and the internet opened up a vast array of outside contacts for her. She invested her money wisely, (she\u2019s very good at it) and has mostly done ok by financial standards.But she is tired of everything. As her series of podcasts reveals, she has lived her life as best as she could, but she has reached enough. The problem is that someone is, of necessity, always taking care of her, and ensuring that her life-giving machines never lose power.When Holly finally runs out of choices, Vivian takes her and her boys into her home. Holly\u2019s family gives Vivian one last chance to experience life in a busy and happy household. Holly\u2019s family gives her purpose.They also give her one last chance to pass the benefits of her life, hopefully without the disadvantages, to a friend she cares for, and the town that has cared for her.Escape Rating B+: The Virtues of Oxygen is a story that builds slowly, but involves the reader with all the aspects of both of its protagonists lives. This is not a story where dramatic action would be appropriate, instead it weaves its spell by deepening the reader\u2019s understanding of the difficulties faced by all the characters.Vivian is simply an awesome character. From the first of her \u201cunaired podcasts\u201d Vivian\u2019s personality roars off the page. Her experience is so much broader than the horizons of her iron-lung bound life might have been. For someone who starts out extraordinarily unlucky, she makes the absolute most of what she has. Until she exhausts herself in a way that is as understandable as possible in circumstances that none of us can compare to.Vivian has managed to make herself the personal and economic center of little Bertram Corners, binding the town together in caring for her in a way that helps the town as much as it assists her. It\u2019s obvious from the story that it took Vivian a while, but she finally figured out how to give back to her caregivers and her community in a really big way.Holly\u2019s life keeps going from bad to worse, and she keeps on putting one foot in front of the other, but she\u2019s just not able to dig out of the hole she\u2019s in. Because she doesn\u2019t have any reserves, she can\u2019t manage to help herself make money. Everything that comes in is eaten up by daily life; the mortgage, utilities, keeping both sons clothed and fed, trying to keep their lives from being a complete drag as the house gets more dilapidated.Her life has never recovered from the absurdly young death of her husband. No one expects to die in their early 30\u2019s, with so much of their promise unfulfilled.The town is slowly dying, and into this economic bust Vivian brings a storefront cash-for-gold store. The presence of the store, and it\u2019s city-wise manager Racine brings a boost to the downtown area, and possibly even a boost to Holly\u2019s life. She just can\u2019t figure out what his game is or whether he has one.For a character who changes so much from the beginning of the story to the end, we don\u2019t see as much of Racine\u2019s perspective as might have been helpful. The Virtues of Oxygen is totally Vivian\u2019s and Holly\u2019s stories."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/784471-karen", "userReview": "I would have most certainly given this book 5 stars 2/3 of the way through. I was loving every moment. But then it kind of fell apart at the end. Holly's financial was resolved too quickly and easily, her challenges just kind of disappeared, but the most disappointing part was how Vivian chose to handle her situation. I won't give it away but I was very surprised, and not in a good way, by how it all ended. Nonetheless, I enjoyed everything else about the book so much I only knock off one star for a weak ending.Reading a few of the reviews for it, I have to take issue with those who say Holly's economic troubles did not ring true. They were so right on, it was like they were written right out of my journal when we went through a similar situation, even up to shopping for our kids' Christmas in a used bookstore, giving meaningful books we loved from childhood instead of the electronic gadgets we couldn't afford. And like Holly's boys, our kids thought those were the best presents ever and they have valued those books through the years. Either the author has been through it, or she researched it carefully with those who have, because she perfectly portrayed what it's like to be living middle-class in America with an income below the poverty line."}, {"userName": "Tanya Eby", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4216771-tanya-eby", "userReview": "A really sweet story about every day struggles to live...and just breathe.

I thought the character Vivian was a fictitious symbol of man's ability to rise above suffering and transcend physical limits. By contrast I found the character Holly entirely realistic. Her struggles amid Great Recession-induced economic disintegration were vividly easy to relate to, even if Vivian's life in an iron lung wasn't. When I realized Vivian was real and Holly was fiction, I admired the author's skill in creating such interesting portrayals.

Two women bound by compassion and mutual respect. But there is a commonality that is far more basic and visceral. Both are locked up in prisons not of their own making. I also liked very much how facts of our world were present and significant to the course of the novel. I think it could be argued that the ending is too neatly wrapped, but the conditions that set it in motion are moving and momentous.

The intricacies of life in a small town and a woman with polio really came alive for me."}, {"userName": "Kathleen (Kat) Smith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328680-kathleen-kat-smith", "userReview": "When I asked my husband if he knew what an iron lung was, he paused a moment before telling me it was a medieval torture device. I began to wonder just how many people probably had the same thoughts or were completely baffled at just what this was since technology seems much more advanced than it would have back in the early 1900's. The Virtues of Oxygen by Susan Schoenberger was based on such a true story of Martha Mason, a young woman who spent the majority of her life confined within an iron lung that would breathe for her when polio robbed her of that ability to do so for herself. It was that idea that inspired Susan to use that as the basis for her contemporary fiction involving Vivian Markham, a sixty three year old woman who has spent her entire life since the age of six living in an iron lung. She contracted polio at the age of six and subsequently loses her older sister the day before, leaving her alone and unable to leave the device or she would die. Even though advancements were made in the medical field, for Vivian, those advancements would pass her by, because after so many years of being dependent on the iron lung, her body had atrophied so much that she would not be able to breathe on her own. Her life looking at the world horizontally is the inspiration behind the main character in this novel who is cared for by her aging mother and a staff of rotating volunteers that live in town, that have vowed to help Vivian live in the best way she can. One of her volunteers, Holly is a widow caring for two growing boys while struggling to keep the house she shared with her husband. Now with bills piling up higher than she can hope to pay them, she takes a job working part time as someone who will oversee Vivian's investment in a Cash For Gold business she is setting up in town. With the economy taking a turn for the worse, Holly fears it will only be a matter of time, before their small town newspaper office will go belly up with less ads being sold by the businesses in town. If that happens, despite what she hopes about holding on to her home, she will have to let the bank foreclose on the home. But for now, Holly's mother has been helping her with the mortgage payments. When the unforeseeable happens and Holly's mother has a stroke, suddenly she will be forced to make some hard decisions to avoid living on the streets with her boys. She wants to know that her life here has meant something much like Vivian does. They want to make a difference in the lives of those around them and not merely be a burden instead. I received The Virtues of Oxygen by Susan Schoenberger compliments of Lake Union Publishing and TLC Book Tours for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. This is such a poignant story of two very different women that are united by their ability to survive despite the challenges odds against them. For Vivian it was physically and for Holly, financially. Yet despite the odds, they persevere in ways they never dreamed possible and it will be the one thing that will hold them together just when things begin to grow dark in their lives. They will come to understand that they see the real person they are on the inside despite what they look like on the outside. In the end those hollow places in their soul will feel less hollow because they had been useful to a remarkable spirit whose every breath as forced as it was, mattered. I absolutely LOVED this novel and can't wait to share it with you. It's heart felt, well written with every ounce of human passion that the writer could pour into this story and trust me in the end, it will leave you changed for the better and in these tough times we all find ourselves living in, there is truly something for us all in this novel. I easily rate this one a 4.5 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3973707-dawn", "userReview": "One of the things I liked about this story was how half the story (about Holly, a youngish mom of two boys who still misses her husband who died years ago, and who is struggling to make ends meet during the recession in the small but cozy town of Bertram Corners) centers on very current and easy-to-relate-to issues, and half the story (about Vivian, a 63-year-old woman who contracted polio at age 6 and has lived in an iron lung ever since) centers on interesting, sometimes terrifying issues that were prevalent in our nation's past (polio), and then how the story brings Vivian from that past into the current trends. It's quite well done, and I loved how Vivian copes and adapts to new technology and means of supporting herself sometimes better than other members of her community do. Vivian is whip-smart and efficient, but her story is moving and believable, because her personality isn't all sugar and spice. Her temper tantrums, a self-centered foray into alcohol exploration at the expense of a sweet friend, and other lippy moments provide a more real, in-depth look at her character.The story is more character-driven than action-packed, but several things are still happening and moving at a fast enough pace that readers shouldn't be bored for a minute. A few of the highlights: Holly's mom loses her jewelry after suffering a stroke ... what's happened to it? Then there's Racine, the guy coming in from New York to open a cash-for-gold store which Vivian has invested in (and hired Holly, who also works for the community newspaper, to oversee Racine's operation). Is he really interested in Holly, who hasn't had a date since her husband died? Or is he a scam artist or a thief? What will Holly do when the newspaper is threatened because ad sales are down? And what does one say to a former friend who now works at a bank and threatens to foreclose on your home - which you've always paid on time, for years - until you just can't anymore. How do you NOT buy your children gifts for Christmas - but what options do you have when you have no money and your credit cards are all maxed out?\"The Virtues of Oxygen\" presents questions most of us understand and have either had to answer the same questions, or known people who have had to answer them. There were several spots in the book where Holly was voicing her thoughts and fears and I would think, \"I know exactly what you mean!\"The only quibble I had with the book was the relationship between Holly and Racine. All the other relationships - Holly and Vivian; Holly and her boys; Vivian and her parents - all felt solid and had depth and intrigue. Racine is a likable character and he had mystery, which I liked, and whatever it is between him and Holly had a nice air of possibility, but things happen between the two which in a real world would need some kind of discussion. But these two move from somewhat odd yet still understandable events, reactions and an uncertain standing to something else with no transition and very little dialog. Other than that little blip, the story was engaging, enjoyable and heart-warming."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1603234-darlene", "userReview": "Originally posted at: http://www.peekingbetweenthepages.com...The Virtues of Oxygen by Susan Schoenberger is a wonderful novel. It not only was a story that touched my heart but also one that makes you think about how precious the gift of life is. Taking place in a small town during the recession The Virtues of Oxygen is an emotional tale of love and friendship but even more so about making each moment in our lives matter.The story revolves around Vivian and Holly, both very different in their circumstance in life. Vivian has been confined in an iron lung since having polio as a young child. Although she has her bad moments she really has a strong spirit and amazing strength that keeps her going each day. As the years passed Vivian earned a degree in business and has been successful despite not being able to live as a normal person. Being a sweet lady the small community has always rallied around Vivian and many volunteer to sit with her as she has to have constant supervision. She literally depends on the machine to live \u2013 to breathe.Then there\u2019s Holly, a widow with two boys. She began sitting with Vivian when she moved back to her hometown after getting married and they formed an instant bond. Holly works at the local newspaper but she\u2019s struggling. With help from her mother she\u2019s been able to at least keep up with her bills but now her mother has has a stroke. Holly\u2019s world is quickly closing in on her. Although she\u2019s never discussed her troubles with Vivian she knows that things aren\u2019t going well for Holly. She wants to help but even more she wants Holly to realize that she can reach for anything she wants and get it if only she wants it bad enough.This book really makes a person think of life in a different way. I had heard of iron lungs but didn\u2019t know what one looked like until I looked it up. I can\u2019t imagine being confined in one for a minute let alone a whole life. The one thing Vivian craved was a even a moment alone because she\u2019d never had that and I know I would feel the same. This novel made me realize that you have to take the time to enjoy your family, friends, and even that moment in which you can step outside and take a breath of fresh, beautiful air.I listened to the audiobook of The Virtues of Oxygen which is narrated by Tanya Eby and Laural Merlington who both did a wonderful job. I\u2019ve listened to Tanya Eby before and always enjoy her narration but Laural Merlington was new to me and was perfect as Vivian. I felt that the two of them really brought out the emotional side to this novel and as a warning \u2013 be sure to have a Kleenex nearby!For fans of women\u2019s fiction I highly recommend The Virtues of Oxygen."}, {"userName": "kim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2426600-kim", "userReview": "When I was offered the chance to review this book, I almost passed on it. To be honest, I tend to judge a book, at least initially, by its cover, and this one does nothing for me! But luckily I went on to read the synopsis and decided to read the book. I\u2019m so glad I did!This is a story of a friendship. Vivian contracted polio as a young girl and was left paralyzed to the point that she can not breathe without the assistance of the iron lung, a chamber which encloses her entire body from the neck down. She requires 24/7 care to be sure she does not choke and to make sure the generator comes on if she loses electricity. Many of her caregivers are volunteers from her community, one of whom is Holly, a widow with two teenage boys, who is on the brink of bankruptcy. Her husband died when the boys were very young, and she has lived paycheck to paycheck since. She has had no time for romance or entertainment or anything outside the day to day routine of earning a living and caring for her children and Vivian. She has been able to pay her mortgage each month, just barely, with a little help from her mother, but when her mother suffers a stroke, things come to a crisis. One thing I really enjoyed about this book was the way the community pulled together to support Vivian. It was also interesting to see the different reactions people had to Holly\u2019s financial status, and how Holly perceived others felt about her due to her financial difficulties. I also enjoyed reading Vivian\u2019s back-story, told in unaired podcasts spread throughout the book.I grew up hearing horror stories of polio and iron lungs as the justification for getting shots at the doctor. I\u2019m not sure I ever really took it seriously or realized just how devastating polio can be, and I certainly did not realize that iron lungs are NOT things of the distant past. I\u2019ve seen one in the local science center, but I thought they were relics, so it really surprised me to read this contemporary story of a woman who lives life in an iron lung. The author explains her inspiration for Vivian came from a newspaper article she\u2019d read about a polio survivor named Martha Mason, who also lived life in an iron lung. After I finished the book, I googled Martha Mason to learn more about her, and recognized that many of the details in the book came from her story. My Rating: \u2605\u2605\u26051/2 3-1/2 StarsThis book review is included in a tour by TLC Book Tours. I was provided a review copy and have written an honest review which appears above."}], "description": "From the award-winning author of \"A Watershed Year\" comes a heartrending story of unlikely bonds made under dire straits.
