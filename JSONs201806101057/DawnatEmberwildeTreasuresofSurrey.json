There are not many authors that make it to my privileged auto read list when they release a book but Sarah E. Ladd definitely is on the list. Now what author do I automatically think of when I want to read an excellent regency you may ask, well it would be one and the same, Sarah E. Ladd. I really enjoyed this book. There was a light romance in the book and the book was full of intrigue,danger around every corner,smugglers,deception and more. The author really knows how to set up the atmospheric feel to get the reader fully involved in the book.

It fully transported me to the English countryside setting and was paced in a way to allow me to relax into the story while keeping me immersed with the search for further information about the plot and characters. I appreciate that the author didn't tell all the details about each character's lives in the beginning, but allowed me to discover them bit by bit through the narrative. Isabel is my favorite kind of heroine- strong in her convictions and loyal to those she loves. The sudden transition in her life is difficult to adjust to, but her role as guardian to Lizzie leads her to be an example of making the best of things instead of dwelling on the negative. I loved the words of advice from her Fellsworth friend Mary that she takes to heart, \"Remember, with each dawn seek guidance, and with each night give gratitude. For there is a divine plan for each of our lives, and a journey, and you have started yours.\" Although Isabel tries her best, the anxiety of living in a world where things are not always what they seem brings emotions to the surface, and her reactions and struggles are realistically portrayed.Colin is another favorite type of hero- quiet and steady with gentleness and intelligence. Those qualities comforted and appealed to Isabel and endeared him to her as he proved trustworthy with each encounter. The efforts of Isabel's aunt to match her with another were frustrating and Colin's former flame trying to ingratiate herself back into his affections made me nervous and brought tension to the various romantic angles. Colin's work to solve the case of smuggling in the woods of Emberwilde adds another level of intrigue throughout the story. With everything that is going on, it never felt overwhelming, instead the various aspects wove together and balanced out the pacing. This was a perfect Regency reading experience and I highly recommend Dawn at Emberwilde, especially to fans of Julie Klassen and Sarah M. Eden.(Thank you to Thomas Nelson and Litfuse Publicity for a copy of the book in exchange for my honest review)"}, {"userName": "Carrie Schmidt (Reading is My SuperPower)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084197-carrie-schmidt-reading-is-my-superpower", "userReview": "4.5 starsWhenever I pick up a book by Sarah Ladd, I know I need to make sure I have a few hours carved out to do nothing but read. Why? Because I know I will be unable to do anything but read until I\u2019ve soaked in every delightful word and each exquisite scene. Ladd\u2019s writing evokes Austen or Bronte, a classic British style (from an American, no less) that wraps you in comforting familiarity and may even have you double checking that publication date to make sure it says 2016 and not 1816!Dawn at Emberwilde is another such book by Sarah Ladd and may in fact be my favorite so far! I devoured it in one sitting this afternoon and I\u2019m already wishing I had time for a re-read. The countryside setting, the vivid characters, the thread of suspense that tunnels through the plot \u2026 all of these elements held me captive.Dawn at Emberwilde is everything I want in a Regency romance. Sarah Ladd immerses readers in the setting with her rich descriptions, and the gentle undertones of mystery added an almost gothic feel to the novel. Delicious swoonworthy romance will have you holding your breath and grinning in delight, though the journey is not without moments of angst that will have you holding your breath for entirely different reasons. The theme of treasure \u2013 both literal and metaphorical \u2013 continues a bit more loosely perhaps than it did in The Curiosity Keeper but with no less poignancy. (I have my theories on what the literal treasure is in Dawn at Emberwilde but I don\u2019t want to spoil anything for you so I\u2019m keeping it to myself for now.) Though this is the second book in the Treasures of Surrey series, it can absolutely be read as a stand alone with no problems.

Dawn at Emberwilde is her latest, and I think my favorite to date. Isabel Creston finds herself swept into her relatives' home unexpectedly, and it seems her life has taken a turn for the much better. Only problem is there tension between her aunt and uncle, incredible pressure to marry a man she can't quite trust, and concerns for her younger sister. Colin is on the trail of smugglers and danger seems to be invading his small corner of Surrey. Isabel doesn't know who to trust, and Colin doesn't feel free to pursue a relationship. This story is a delightful retreat to old England and has an almost gothic feel with the woods becoming a character in themselves. The intrigue is deep and the mystery enjoyable. The romance was beautiful, and there are several supporting characters I'd love to see in their own books. All in all I inhaled this book as fast as I could find the time. It will delight Jane Austen readers."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "This was a well done Regency novel. It is the second in the Treasures of Surrey series. I was swept away with the characters, time period and setting right away through the author's descriptive writing. I enjoyed the inclusion of a couple of mysteries into the plot. The only downside is one of the mysteries was rather easy to solve and the second wasn't fully resolved. Although I would have liked the mystery piece to be a bit stronger, it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the novel.It was pure joy reading the pages of Dawn at Emberwilde. I look forward to the third book in the series which comes out in 2017.The Treasures of Surrey series is recommended for fans of Julie Klassen.

Two characters who just \"know\" they are supposed to be together. They spend very little of this book in the same room, talk very little, but they just know they are meant to be together.

The English countryside, a mysterious forest, and grand estates provide the backdrop for romance and suspense that is gently paced, yet held my attention throughout. With its 1817 setting in Surrey, England, this narrative reflects the Jane Austen style, with a little bit of Cinderella mixed in, and even has elements of the gothic style that I\u2019ve always loved. Sarah E. Ladd is in her element when it comes to the Regency novel, and while I\u2019ve enjoyed all of her stories, Dawn at Emberwilde is without a doubt my favorite. Isabel and Colin are great characters, as are secondary characters Henry, Colin\u2019s brother, and Mary, Isabel\u2019s friend from Fellsworth School. Forced to leave the comfortable environment of the school, Isabel is faced with strict rules imposed by her aunt and the unwelcome thought of marrying to secure her future. Even Isabel\u2019s cousin, Constance, had been raised with this life goal firmly in place \u2026 \u201cTo make a match. To marry. To grasp security.\u201d Independent and confident one moment, while insecure and doubtful the next, Isabel is easy to relate to in her humanness. Colin, local magistrate and landowner, is a very appealing leading man. To Isabel, his \u201ckindness and gentleness were more attractive than money or prestige.\u201dSpiritual themes are very subtle in this story, reflected more in character behavior than actual words. We\u2019re reminded to look beyond the surface, that people and circumstances aren\u2019t always what they seem \u2013 and also to seek God\u2019s will for life\u2019s needs. I especially loved these words of Isabel\u2019s friend, Mary . . .\u201cNo experience is ever wasted. It is being used to fashion you into the person you are meant to be, and to move you to the place where you are supposed to go.\u201dAlthough Dawn at Emberwilde is #2 in the series, it stands alone. I do hope we see Mary\u2019s story next!

The quote above is spoken by our heroine, Isabel, near the end of Dawn at Emberwilde, the second in Sarah E. Ladd\u2019s Treasures of Surrey series.In life, perspective makes all the difference. It can be difficult to remember that God is at work when we are too closely connected to the threads of our own story. Eventually, time and distance allow us to begin to view the larger picture. Though we don\u2019t have the luxury of crystal balls or time machines so that we might anticipate our future, we have certain tools at our disposal: prayer and history. We can learn from our past as well as from the stories of others, fictional characters included.Isabel\u2019s journey begins at Fellsworth School. Though she is a bit of a dreamer, Isabel would never imagine a future for herself that included grand estates, invitation-only dinner parties, dancing, and marriage. Not a chance! She knows her place in the world, and it\u2019s not attending balls or enjoying \u201ca season\u201d trying to secure the heart (or fortune) of an eligible bachelor. As orphaned wards, she and her little sister Lizzie are likely headed for a life as teachers or governesses. But with the sudden arrival of a tall, dark stranger at Fellsworth, Isabel\u2019s life is turned upside down.Some readers have referred to Dawn at Emberwilde as a Cinderella story or rags to riches tale. You might also consider Isabel as an \u201cAlice\u201d who has gone down the rabbit hole. Indeed, from a utilitarian life as a charity ward, she is thrust into the extravagant world of the landed gentry. Even more disorienting, although there are no strange women hidden in the attic at Emberwilde, the house does appear to have secrets connected to local lore surrounding dark mysteries in the Emberwilde Forest (or as the locals call it \u2014 the Black Forest).Before I wrap up, I want to take a moment to discuss this as a work of Christian fiction. I\u2019ve seen some readers who have wanted more overt Christianity tied into the novel. Some have even gone so far as to say it could have been released as a general market title. In the 19th-century, perhaps. Today? Not likely. Just because the novel doesn\u2019t evangelize doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t Christian messages. I\u2019d argue that, in a sense, this is more Christian because it\u2019s more realistic. We don\u2019t walk through life being pointed to little signs neatly explaining what God is teaching us. Nor do we often run into people with whom we\u2019ve previously spoken very little and suddenly start speaking at length about God and Jesus. Okay, maybe some of you do. But my life hasn\u2019t worked that way. So why should a novel be expected to do so?Although this is a romance novel, it\u2019s the mystery and the unanswered questions that kept me happily turning the pages. Not to mention the fact that Isabel\u2019s outsider status allows her a critical appraisal of the so-called \u201cgood life\u201d of the wealthy. She\u2019s a heroine worthy of your affection. I only wish we could have had more of her story.Don\u2019t let the fact that Dawn At Emberwilde is the second in a series deter you; the novel stands completely alone. Although this was my first experience reading a book by Sarah E. Ladd, it has not only found a welcome home in my library, but will soon have the company of other Ladd books. This Regency should find favor with folks who enjoy Julie Klassen or Jane Austen. So what are you waiting for? Pick up a copy of Dawn at Emberwilde today!Verdict: 4.5 of 5 Stars. A Light Regency Romance With a Touch of Darkness.The interplay between dark and light in Dawn at Emberwilde makes for a satisfying experience. Like Isabel, readers will be drawn to the mysterious dark woods in search of answers, buoyed by the wise words of her friend Mary, dazzled by the prestige and privilege of wealth, yet confounded at how anyone could choose a life of stability over a home filled with love. Indeed, with Dawn at Emberwilde, Sarah E. Ladd demonstrates that life is neither all light nor all dark, but a delicate dance between the two \u2014 one made more secure, not by wealth or status, but by faith and love.*Disclosure of Material Connection: I would like to thank Litfuse Publicity Group and TNZ\u2019s Fiction Guild for providing me with copies of Dawn at Emberwilde in exchange for an honest review.

Now, at the edge of a forest filled with dark secrets, she faces a fateful choice between love and duty. For as long as she can remember, beautiful and free-spirited Isabel has strained against the rules and rigidity of the Fellsworth School in the rolling English countryside. No longer a student, Isabel set her sights on a steady yet unexciting role as a teacher at the school, a safe yet stifling establishment that would provide her a steady environment to care for her younger sister Lizzie, who was left in her care after her father\u2019s death. The unexpected arrival of a striking stranger with news of unknown relatives turns Isabel\u2019s small, predictable world upside down, sweeping her and her young charge into a labyrinth of intrigue and hidden motives. At her new family\u2019s invitation, Isabel and Lizzie relocate to Emberwilde, a sprawling estate adjacent to a vast, mysterious wood rife with mysterious rumors and ominous folklore\u2014along with whispers of something far more sinister. And perhaps even more startling, two handsome men begin pursuing Isabel, forcing her to learn the delicate dance between attraction, the intricate rules of courtship, and the hopes of her heart. At Emberwilde, Isabel will discover that the key to unlocking the mystery of her past may also open the door to her future and security.

I personally found that department lacking in this book, with no real mentions of faiths or God\u2026only a couple Scriptures are read. I would have liked some more faith parts. I saw quite a few parts where Isabel or Colin could have prayed, but, sadly, didn\u2019t. Three stars means that \u201cI liked this book\u201d, so yes, I did like this book, but it was really light and easy to read. Nothing really stood out to me while reading it. It was a cute romance, but the back-cover made me feel like there would be a love-triangle, but when one of those men are POV characters, it\u2019s not really much of a love-triangle. I liked Isabel & Lizzy and enjoyed the sister moments between them. I might read the next book in the series when it releases in Spring of 2017, but it will depend on the story-line.

Ladd yet! Never mind that I haven't read the first book of this series, Dawn at Emberwilde was a thoroughly enjoyable read - sweet and suspenseful. A bit of a quick read, with a heartwarming and romantic ending that is fully satisfying!Book Two to the TREASURES OF SURREY series, this story centers on twenty-year-old, orphan Isabel Creston who is relocating to her aunt and uncle's place, Emberwilde; and Colin Galloway, the local magistrate. As Isabel struggles to find her place at her new home, Colin investigates suspicious activities deep within Emberwilde Forest. All is not as it seems. And Isabel must find who she can trust with her and her sister Lizzie's well-being.I really like Regency romances. And this one was light and sweet. It did have a generous hint of suspense, but not too heavy. Just about how I prefer! *smiles* I enjoyed the characters of Colin and Isabel ... both relatable and someone you would hope happiness for! There was a hint of a faith theme. I like a deeper Christian aspect, but this did suit Dawn at Emberwilde just fine. As I mentioned, it was more of a light read. A romance to warm your heart. That being said, the romance actually was pretty subtle. But still there, in a way, for the duration of the story. There were a couple kisses exchanged at the end, but nothing more. I have to say, it was rather refreshing. None of those too-soon, passionate kissing scenes. But more of a gentle romance. I quite liked it! ^_^All in all, I had a lovely time reading this book, and really look forward to reading more by Sarah E. Ladd!

We have Isabel Creston, a young woman with only a sister to call family, until relatives she didn't know she had invite her to live with them. Isabel has no choice but to accept, and take her younger sister, Lizzie, with her. At Emberwilde, Isabel and Lizzie have to learn to be proper ladies, and realize that their lives have greatly changed.With her new situation, Isabel can start thinking about things like marriage, and there are two candidates available. I wouldn't really call this a love triangle though, I think it's made clear very early in the book who holds her interest.Another important part of the story is the presence of criminals at the property, the forest, to be more precise. Colin Galloway, one of Isabel's suitors, is following the trail of dangerous men prowling the area, but things seem to be more complicated than he thought.This book did hold my interest for a while, but as the story progressed, I felt that it was all going too slow, both the romantic part and the mystery with the forest criminals.

Ladd! It has just enough mystery and intrigue to keep you guessing and a lovely dose of romance to warm your heart. :)I really like how the mystery and the romance unfolded in this book. There was enough suspense to keep your attention throughout the book with a satisfactory conclusion. And the romance of two handsome yet vastly different men attracting Isabel's attention was well done. You felt the ease of the attraction to the mysterious Mr. Bradford yet you also feel the draw to the steadiness and character of the handsome Mr. Galloway. I also enjoyed the supporting characters. Isabel's sister Lizzie had a fun personality and helped relieve some of the somberness in several situations. Isabel's cousin Constance was, for the most part, a real help and friend to Isabel in the new world she found herself in. Mr. Galloway's big, burly, friend and co-worker, McKinney, was fun to imagine. And his cousin, Henry, was a good support to him also.All in all, this book is very well written with a gentle pace that will be easy to follow and very enjoyable. Oh, and I can't forget the setting!

Having lived most of her life at the Fellsworth School, benefiting from the charity of others, Isabel dares to hope for a brighter future for herself and her little sister, Lizzie. Arriving at the grand Emberwilde estate curiously breeds a sense of unease; an aura of family secrets surrounds the vast property and societal expectations effectively suffocate the freedom that Isabel so desperately craves. When two handsome men vie for Isabel's personal attention, she is faced with a dangerous choice. Only one can truly hold the key to her heart, while the other may not be at all who he declares himself to be. Sarah Ladd's books just keep getting better and better. \"The Dawn of Emberwilde\" is an inspiring story of faith and determination, expertly woven with suspenseful romance.

I found it interesting to watch as Isabel and her younger sister, Lizzie, were thrust into a lifestyle unlike any they had ever experienced. The author did a good job of showing the benefits, as well as the burdens that this brought for both young women.I thought that the developing romantic feelings between the main characters was very nicely done, in spite of an interfering aunt and a pushy suitor. The mysterious and dangerous forest added for plenty of tense situations and I enjoyed watching as Colin and his friends tried to determine who was behind the criminal activity in the area.I loved the way the author tied up the loose ends in the last few chapters of this novel. It left me with a happy feeling. Although this is the second book in the Treasures of Surrey series, it is a stand alone novel.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.You can read this review on my blog at:https://brittreadsfiction.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "3.5 stars A pleasant story about a young woman, Isabel, who was brought up in a foundling home. She has the guardianship of her younger half sister, Lizzie, and is training to be a teacher or a governess. Suddenly a strange man shows up at the school and tells her she has long lost relatives who want her to come live with them. They are rich and live in a beautiful house called Emberwilde. She is living a widely different life full of luxury and ease. She is being courted by two men- Mr. Bradford, head of the local foundling home and Mr. Galloway, local magistrate and land owner. Still she is not really comfortable with her new life. There is a smuggling operation going on in the town and secret tunnels. It has lots of local color and it is quite interesting to read of the times. I didn't realize it was a romance story until I got it and I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I had known. Still I liked it and it's story line really elevated it. If you like romance stories this is great.

Sometimes I did get a little annoyed with Isabel, since I didn't always agree with her methods of raising Lizzie and even agreed with her difficult aunt upon a occasion. So while I admit that Isabel did take a little while to grow on me, I certainly had sympathy with her situation. (There's no question that I liked Colin, though!)At any rate, this is a lovely historical read for romance fans.I received this book through litfuse publicity.

I've forgotten how much I enjoyed them. While this is book 2 in the series, it stands alone, and one does not need to have read book 1 in order to enjoy this one. I was quickly drawn into the story, and I found myself intrigued by Isabel. As for the two men who vie for her attention and affection, there was one I liked more than the other. I was rooting for him the entire time. I also enjoyed the fact that this book had a touch of mystery in it that added to the richness of the story. I received this book for free from BookLook Bloggers for the purpose of reviewing. My thoughts and opinions are my own.Recommended to fans of: Jane Austen, Julie Klassen, Jody HedlundRating - 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Michelle Griep", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1872642-michelle-griep", "userReview": "Love Austen?

Ladd has written a graceful story about a young lady raised in a school for children from homes of lesser means or orphaned. As the book opens, she learns that she is not entirely without family and that she is being claimed and must now journey to the home of a previously unknown aunt.She is treated as treasured for her beauty and who will be married off as quickly as possible. Without dowry to make a grand marriage, she is to be betrothed to the head of the local foundlings school. She has feelings of uncertainty about this gentleman and fears future involvement.The beautiful and dark forest seems to beckon her, and her young sister. They are warned to stay away from it because danger lurks within. But little sister, Lizzie, wanders into its depths, gets frightened by some scary men, and hides.The story meanders along at a gentle pace giving the reader a glimpse into the status a poor relative has in the home of the landed gentry of England in the early 1800s. At her aunt's mercy and having no place else to go, young Isabel tries to adjust. With two handsome young men nearby, her heart discovers qualities and dislikes about them that give her pause to wonder.A bit of a mystery. A glimpse into social mores of the time. A bit of danger. A sweet little eight year old. And a landed gentleman-magistrate. What an opportunity for a nice read. Written as Christian fiction, it is not pronounced in it's Biblical leanings. The work is clean, gentle, and you won't be afraid to let a young teen or a dear grandmother read it.I was provided a complimentary copy to facilitate this review. Opinions are my own. I was not compensated."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28286656-amy", "userReview": "*FYI - The Goodreads description of this book is incorrect & there are differences in names & locations. The cover is just beautiful & does the story justice, the forest of Emberwilde is full of mystery and legend...and its pictured just as I imagined it. The story begins at Fellsworth School, where Isabel learns of family, that she was unaware of, are now bringing her to their estate to live. She takes her step sister Lizzie with her, as she is her guardian. I did find the beginning of the book a little slow in pace, and if I wasn't a big fan of Sarah Ladd, I may have been tempted to put the book down. This is also my reason for not giving it 5 stars. However, as more personal interactions developed between Isabel - Mr Bradford & of course Colin Galloway, the story seemed more engaging. There did lack the chemistry I would have liked to see, often they seemed indifferent to each other. The plot reels you in though, with the smuggling, and mystery behind the true intentions of Isabel's aunt, and the resulting twist in Isabel's fortunes, made for a good read. Overall, I did love this book, I just prefer to be hooked in faster! There's definitely more danger & intrigue in Sarah's 'Treasures of Surrey' series, so if you want a little more from your Regency romance, these will be the books for you.Thank you to Netgalley & Thomas Nelson Publishing for the ARC. This is my honest review."}], "description": "Isabel Creston never dared to dream that love could be hers. Now, at the edge of a forest filled with dark secrets, she faces a fateful choice between love and duty.For as long as she can remember, beautiful and free-spirited Isabel has strained against the rules and rigidity of the Fellsworth School in the rolling English countryside. No longer a student, Isabel set her sights on a steady yet unexciting role as a teacher at the school, a safe yet stifling establishment that would provide her a steady environment to care for her younger sister Lizzie, who was left in her care after her father\u2019s death.The unexpected arrival of a striking stranger with news of unknown relatives turns Isabel\u2019s small, predictable world upside down, sweeping her and her young charge into a labyrinth of intrigue and hidden motives.At her new family\u2019s invitation, Isabel and Lizzie relocate to Emberwilde, a sprawling estate adjacent to a vast, mysterious wood rife with mysterious rumors and ominous folklore\u2014along with whispers of something far more sinister. And perhaps even more startling, two handsome men begin pursuing Isabel, forcing her to learn the delicate dance between attraction, the intricate rules of courtship, and the hopes of her heart.At Emberwilde, Isabel will discover that the key to unlocking the mystery of her past may also open the door to her future and security.
