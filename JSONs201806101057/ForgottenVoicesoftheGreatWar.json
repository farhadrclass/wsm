These are not the transcripts read by a professional narrator - they are the actual interviews, (with some very strong and rich regional accents!) which makes this especially powerful. It also gives this the feel more of a BBC Radio 4 documentary than a book. With only the bare skeleton of a narrative, this won't tell you what happened, when, where or why. Instead, it will give you a real insight into what it actually felt like to live in the trenches, to cower as artillery exploded, to go \"over the top\", to survive as the next man was killed. Includes some surprisingly candid interviews about fear, cowardice, and the prized \"Blighty Wound\"."}, {"userName": "'Aussie Rick'", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2413336-aussie-rick", "userReview": "Max Arthur\u2019s book; Forgotten Voices of the Great War, is quite unique in that it's content is nearly all first-hand accounts from people who experienced the horror of the Great War. The author has utilized a number of tape recorded interviews conducted by the Imperial War Museum in 1972. Many of the tapes from the Imperial War Museum Sound Archive had been forgotten and left unheard for years. Now Max Arthur has put together many of these unheard voices from the Great War to produce this spellbinding and captivating book. I must admit that I was reluctant to buy this book as I was worried that a book full of short accounts would be too disjointed and really not detailed enough to satisfy my interest. I can honestly say that I truly enjoyed reading this book. Each chapter of the book was a year of the Great War and was commenced by an introduction by the author offering a brief run down on the major events of that year. Then we heard from the men and women who participated in these events, from both sides of no-man\u2019s land. The author has concentrated mainly on the Western Front and Gallipoli and has tried to run the oral segments in chronological order.I was really taken by these segments and I found it hard to stop reading. The accounts from these soldiers and civilians alike were at times humorous, strikingly direct, horrifying and on many occasions quite sad. I was really taken in by these accounts and I don\u2019t think that any World War One library would be complete without this title sitting on the shelf. I can honestly say that I learnt quite a few things from this book and I would place it along side such works offered by Lyn MacDonald. Well done to the author and the Imperial War Museum for allowing these veterans, many now long dead, the last word on their experiences in the Great War. This is a great book, you won\u2019t be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Liz C.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32059786-liz-c", "userReview": "A book that really sticks with you, even if you don\u2019t necessarily know the details of each of the battles mentioned.

From those who were shamed into enlisting, despite only being 15-17 years old, by girls who roamed British streets with feathers they shoved into the faces of young men, to stories by soldiers handcuffed to wagon wheels for days because they missed roll call. Descriptions by those who experienced the waves of chlorine and mustard gas, with advice to urinate on their handkerchiefs or caps and hold them over their mouths in order to save their lungs. Soldiers riddled with dysentery and drowning in their own excrement. Soldiers home for brief leaves from the Front to families who saw the war as one big brave cavalry charge, as opposed to the reality of exhausted men huddled in muddy, lice-infested trenches waiting for bombs to drop on them. Conscientious objectors sentenced to be shot, then commuted to 10 years in prison. Scared deserters who ran off to avoid conflict, only to be court-martialed and then shot to death by their peers. Combatants pending days and nights crouched in a concrete pillbox filled with two feet of muddy, filthy water, filled with excrement and the rotting bodies of enemy soldiers. WW1 jolted the globe in dramatic ways, such that before and after inalterably changed mankind. Traditional methods of warfare were utilized at the beginning, but by the war\u2019s end, \u201cfair play\u201d of military engagement was redefined in so many ways through airplanes, tanks and chemical warfare.That 100 years have passed only serves to underscore the significance of this event and its impact on our modern world. This book provides a visceral reality check of this seminal event in our history. It also gives reverence and a voice to the unquestionably courageous, inspirational men and women who persevered through his period in history, capturing their own unfiltered words and experiences for posterity.Highly recommend this."}, {"userName": "Jan C", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1855321-jan-c", "userReview": "This was probably 3 1/2.

I liked the first chapter and the opening paragraphs of each chapter where Max Arthur gives the reader a path to the events in each chapter before turning the narrative to those that survived the war. There are four chapters, one for each year of the war - however that is where the organization of the book ends and chaos reigns. There aren't many headers, just for the ones that indicate a major battle is being talked about, but no signal to show the narratives for that particular battle has ended and a new topic is started. So when the narratives turn from one battle memory to another battle memory then all of a sudden the men are talking about venereal disease and how one guy's penis was all gangrene and disintegrating from VD he got from the many French prostitutes he paid for - it was jarring and interrupting the flow of reading. Then there is lots of talk of how boring it is sitting in a trench, trying to burn the lice off their uniforms; there is also a lot of talk about food rations - so much bully beef was mentioned.The one part I really enjoyed was the section on the Christmas Truce of 1914.

I will treasure this book to the end of my life. All this people who were talking to me through all these pages will be with me forever.These forgotten voices are so real. I was with them in trenches, in mud. I could feel their fear, courage, sadness, loneliness, hunger, cold. Most of all I was and I am still mad at all those people who play the wars. I have written \"play\" because I prefer to think that they (people in power, politicians, generals and so on) see a war like some kind of a play. Otherwise, if they are fully conscious of the whole suffering, of each one dead human and they give still orders to fights, they aren't humans at all.Going back to the book, if you are interested in this period of history you must read it. You don't have to know much about The Great War (WWI). I would say you can know nothing at all about battles, troop movements and so on. You will not find much of these in this book. This book is about the people who fought and struggle during those times. Their thoughts, feelings, lives. You will find here many facts that will shock and horrify you. There are mostly the voices of the soldiers but there are also a few voices of ordinary people. After reading it, you can understand more why the world changed so much after WWI.

I'm ot sure I would necessarily put it top of the list for people wanting an introduction to the subject.This book is a transcript of interviews done for the Imperial War Museum some 50 years after the end of the First World War. They are the personal, generally anecdotal memories of by then, old men (and a very few women). All of them survived the War, obviously, and into old age, and apart from one chap who had his leg amputated, they seem to have suffered relatively minor physical injuries. There is no mention of the psychological consequences, and on the whole, the contributors were not able, and or not invited, to provide any sort of reflective analysis.Five chapters one for each of the calendar years, with a brief summary of events at the start of each chapter.

This book came out in 2002, compiled in association with the Imperial War Museum, and consists of numerous anecdotes gathered in the 1990s from survivors--principally British, but also German, French, Australian and American. The value of the book is that it records the tail end of the WW1 generation before they'd all finally died off by the early 2000s. Their anecdotes are powerful and fresh and in most cases represent the most poignant memories of the veterans who recorded them. Time and again, one is struck by the insane bravery of the troops going over the top. They knew, as they assembled in their trenches before an attack, that they would almost certainly be killed, yet did their duty unflinchingly. It was a mad, mad way of conducting a war. The senior officers and politicians still have much to answer for. One is left with a mixture of sadness, outrage, pride and anger.

This blew me away. I have never read another book so intense with details from any war (not that I've read many!). It was a horrific book to read and I had to put it down for a day or so to get a break. Through the voices of many World War 1 veterans, you travel through the four years of the Great War. There was nothing glamorous about it. I wished there had been more of a Christian aspect to the book. That is my main complaint. Also, I gave this a slightly lower rating because of a few things:-Pages 93 (bottom) to 95 (middle) talk quite openly about sexual interaction. Definitely not appropriate to read, and I would avoid these pages if I read again.-Page 259 (bottom section) also mentions sexuality.-Several uses of swear words.-It is a graphic read and many times I had to make myself not think of the details.Overall it is very informative and fascinating.

The sound and images weren\u2019t always perfect but the stories gathered were astounding. A few pages into this book, I realised that was the source for this book! It was such a clever idea to tell the shocking story of the so-called Great War by compiling those interviews into a narrative, summarising the War Years. What is special is that they interviewed lots different men and women. When you learn about history from the people who actually lived through it, it really comes alive! The telling is enriched by the discovery of all small insider detail that combine with the thoughts, feelings and impression with historical fact which really give the modern day reader and unique insider perspective. The text is also peppered with photographs of both the contributors and of events at the time. The story of Christmas 2014 is incredible. Can you imagine being at war with someone, only to stop and become friends for the day. The have to go back to killing each other a few hours later? Random thought: I thought Germans did Christmas on December 24th? Surely the whole country wouldn't have changed the date from December 25th to 24th after a few soldiers fraternising?And this wasn't the only astounding examples of friendship across the divide either.But, the further on I read, the more frustrated I get, because I'm not that familiar with WWI. This brief summary of snippets (which are often out of context) was confusing to me. And many sections left me desperately wanting to know either what happened just before or what happened next.But the biggest disappointment is that this collection is literally a White Wash (no non white soldiers or peoples included here). Were none interviewed for this archive? It wouldn't surprise me if that was the case, but it's a terrible error if it is. Take for instance the brief and unflattering mention of Indian soldiers who had apparently deliberately injured themselves - there's a story to be told right there (were they doing it because they had been forced into the army against their will?). Because there were also many brits who deliberately got themselves a Blighty (injury to get sent home). There was also a fleeting mention of Senegalese soldiers. I'm assuming they were from Senegal. It could only have enriched this book to add some diversity.I do think I this book could make an interesting foundation for a film."}, {"userName": "John Scothern", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66923212-john-scothern", "userReview": "Another book that I've found addictive and difficult to put down...hence the speed of transition through the 313 pages in 4 days!It's layout is easy to read and contribution of each 'voice' varies between a few lines and couple of pages, so it is the sort of book to be picked up for a few minutes..or a few hours if you wish.The 'voices' speak for themselves, all ranks, officers, nurses, doctors, girlfriends, nationalities, etc. inviting you to read and ingest their first-hand recollections of the period and conflict between countries, as well as the circumstances and encounters of their personal lives amongst it all. There is no 'sugar coating' but equally you will find humour, too.Little 'triumphalism' either and if so it's rather short-lived. Certainly there is abundant evidence of what life was really like and the human qualities shared by them.What came through to me in particular was the dogged, daily persistence of the people to 'see things through', good or bad, adapting as they could to conditions alongside their 'chums'..and not assuming that they would come out of it alive in the face of such forces and industrially driven powers of destruction .

For some it would be their only adventure as they met their fate in the mud and blood of a foreign field. For those who returned home life would never be the same again. Lost and bewildered in a fog of shell shock, with lungs irretrievably damaged by gas and stench, and with hearts and minds made heavy by man's inhumanity to man, an entire generation had their youth and vitality stolen from them, in a world that would never be the same again.In Forgotten Voices of the Great War, the author Max Arthur, brings to the life the stories of those men and women who fought and died during the 1914-1918 conflict.

Horror and absurdity to match anything that Catch 22 has to offer, plus the occasional humour; imagine extracting a live cow from a covert artillery pit or Brits and ANZAC playing cricket during a lull in the shelling!One particular, oft cited occurrence that stuck with me was that of English women at home giving a white feather to any man that they saw out of uniform, even to veterans on leave, a despicable practice that shows the enigma of complicity and collective guilt. A practice that thankfully didn't continue when the War resumed some 20 years later.Here are several quotes to give you a taste of what this book contains:- Almost the last feather I received was on the bus. I was sitting near the door when I became aware of two women on the other side talking at me, and I thought to myself, 'Oh Lord, here we go again.' I didn't pay much attention. However, I suppose I must have caught their eye in some way because one lent forward and produced a feather and said, 'Here's a gift for a brave soldier.' I took it and said, 'Thank you very much- I wanted one of those'. Then I took my pipe out of my pocket and and put this feather down the stem and everything and worked it in a way I've never worked a pipe cleaner before. When it was filthy I pulled it out and said, ' You know, we didn't get these in the trenches,' and handed it back to her. She instinctively put her hand out a took it, so there she was sitting with this filthy pipe cleaner in her hand and all the other people on the bus began to get indignant.Then she dropped it and got up to get out, but we were nowhere near a stopping place and the bus went on for quite a long way while she got well and truly barracked by the rest of the people on the bus. I sat back and laughed like mad. Private Norman Demuth,15th Battalion,London RegimentAt Pilckem ridge I can still see the bewilderment and fear on the men's faces when we went over the top.C and D company was support, A and B had had to go at the front line. All over the battlefield the wounded were lying down, English and German asking for help. We weren't like the good Samaritan in the Bible, we were the robbers who passed by and left them. You couldn't help them. I came across a Cornishman, ripped from shoulder to waist with shrapnel, his stomach on the ground beside him in a pool of blood. As I got to him he said,'Shoot Me!', he was beyond all human aid. Before we could even draw a revolver he had died. He just said 'Mother'. I will never forget itPrivate Harry Patch, Cornwall's Light Infantry...An attack started forming up against us out of Polygon Wood.At the same time there was a gun ranging on this particular trench. It had obviously seen us go there and I imagine it was one of four guns in a battery. I knew that once that battery got the range and opened fire we were done for. At the same time a machine gun, which seemed very much closer than I liked, swept the top of our parapet and killed three in the process.They'd got the position exactly. We were in a very perilous situation.I sat down as there was nothing to be done, and did what I generally did on those occasions- I played chess with my adjutant. I always had with me, a little chessboard with pegs. We played on, rather aimlessly it is true, but it steadied the men. Then suddenly a shell fell into the trench. I thought to myself 'Now your time has come. You've had a long run for your money and I wonder what it will be like to be dead.' At that moment i realised that whatever happened I wasn't going to be killed. It's impossible to describe this consciousness. It's not like ordinary consciousness at all, it's something like a prophet of old when the Lord spoke, something quite overwhelmingly clear and convincing. I wasn't very proud of myself because I didn't care what happened to the others - I was going to survive. I took a rifle and began shooting. I hit two Germans at six hundred yards and made a third skip for his life. The extra ordinary part is that the machine gun never fired a again, ...yet there was no reason why it should have stopped. It was as though for a moment I got a glimpse of time coming towards me.Lieutenant Colonel Alan Hanbury-Sparrow,2nd Battalion,Royal Berkshire RegimentThe Australians suggested that as we were having a few days without any particular battle going on, it was surely the moment to have a Test Match. They found a bit of unshelled ground within reach of their position and ours, we got some bats, balls ,bales and stumps- and we played cricket. What the Germans could have thought was going on I can't imagine. But it must have been reported by some German because unfortunately next morning, when the Australians were assembling on the pitch and we were on our way, they were heavily shelled. Some were killed and others were woundeed and the ground was ruined.

This involves everyone from front line troops, to women working in munitions factories back in Britain. As well as, inevitably, being horrifying, it's also deeply moving in places, and sometimes even infuriating (the pompous tone of some of the officers occasionally got my goat).Things that stood out for me:How soldiers on leave in Britain, wearing civvies as an alternative to their lice-filled uniform, were repeatedly given white feathers by young women, ignorant and oblivious to what these men had been experiencing. This was in part due to the media, which had its propaganda purposes, but also because the men themselves just couldn't tell their stories, either as they simply wanted to spare family, or because they knew civilians could not relate, would not understand.The ignorance about gas attacks in the early years of the war, and how troops had no way to protect themselves. Gas masks hadn't been invented, and they were given no instructions. Many had simply heard a rumour that they should piss on their handkerchiefs and tie them round their nose and mouth. One soldier, later on in the way, describes how when they did finally have gas masks, they'd emerge from the gas attack to find the trench full of dead or dying rats. One anecdote by a young land who slipped into a large, flooded shell hole, and kept slipping back whenever he tried to climb out. He eventually gave up trying, shoved his rifle into the mud and held on, passing out or falling asleep from the strain. The comparison between the inconceivable living conditions of the troops in the trenches, wading through mud, wet, freezing, frequently starving, and the officers back in comfortable accommodation behind the lines. And the list goes on. My only criticism is that I might have liked a bit more context - when were these people interviewed precisely? Were they fairly recently memories, or years earlier?

Within it's pages you find a selection of excerpts from interviews with survivors of World War 1 that were undertaken during the 1970s. These are ordered so that they are chronological in their context and include not only the troops at the front, but during the early period of the war. This includes interviews with civilian men and women to give you an insight into the public feeling and enthusiasm for the war.This does not take the form of a military history review of the war describing the major battles and who manoeuvred where. What you get is how the soldiers felt and description of particular moments that stuck in their minds. What this means is that, yes, most of what is being related is depressing, often disgusting, and visceral, but it completely captures what it was like for those poor men at the front living in the trenches in inhuman conditions. There are some humorous moments scattered throughout - the king falling of his horse - but these are few and far between and aid in heightening the ludicrousness of it all.This is an accessible account of the war for everybody in the words of the common soldier. This book should be part of the educational syllabus so that today's and future generations understand what their great (and great-great) grand-parents went through to defend their freedom. Also, it will allow people to wonder why, after all this hell and madness, where people willing to embroil the world in a far greater and more complete world war just 20 years later."}, {"userName": "Belle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37604605-belle", "userReview": "Extremely solid 5 star rating. I can't fault this book. Everything has been thought of even to the point where you can follow individual soldiers, as their pages are listed at the back. It goes without saying that the research and collation is extremely thorough. It has been superbly edited and put together. There's a short intro and battle overview at the beginning of each year and then it all flows pretty much in order of events. For three days, every chance I got my nose was in this book and I couldn't read it fast enough. I took it everywhere and whipped it out even if I only had a minute to spare. I was so busy this week otherwise I would have easily got through this in one sitting. I have memory problems and yet I was able to remember each and every contributor every time they popped back up - which is usually quite difficult for me to do, especially as there were many of them (mainly men obviously but also some women.) Whilst reading these personal statements I felt every emotion imaginable. I was humbled; I was shocked and outraged. My heart was sore but also, occasionally, there was humour and the human spirit really did shine throughout. I felt proud of these people and their achievements and sacrifices. How the world and society has changed in such a short period of time struck me many times while reading this book and I think it should be set reading in schools. I borrowed this from the library but it's one of those rare books that I will buy and return to. I've read more than 60 books so far this year but this is my runaway best book of 2016 (along with another: A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman.) Outstanding."}, {"userName": "Prasidh Ramson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10134789-prasidh-ramson", "userReview": "Lest we forget...Forgotten Voices recounts stories from soldiers (British, German, American and Australian), men and women that lived and fought during World War I (1914-1918). Their oral recollections were collected, transcribed and archived and are presented here. The author starts each chapter with a broad outline of events from that year, followed by short excerpts. Given the large volume of information, the author does well to highlight important historical incidents while following the natural chronology of events. While educational and informative, this is a harrowing and sometimes shocking account of WWI. Some stories include soldiers listening to the crackle of burning lice as they would run a flame over uniform sleeves and pockets every night to get rid of them. Another tale is of a large soldier who fell into a excrement pit - his companions were so tired and he was so heavy that they could not pull him out...they had no choice but to let him die. Some soldiers that returned to their families, feeling so alienated and isolated chose to voluntarily return to the warfront. There are many other similar stories (both on and off the battlefield) that demonstrate the sadness and futility of war. The very personal nature of these stories makes these experiences all the more poignant. Given the recent 100th anniversary of WWI, it's an indictment on us that we have not learnt from our past. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in history or keen on enjoying a first hand account of The Great War."}, {"userName": "Lynyrd", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3149656-lynyrd", "userReview": "Max Arthur's compilation of First World War memories, Forgotten Voices of the Great War, offers a reminder of the scale of human experience within the 1914-18 conflict. Arthur, a military historian best known for his history of the RAF and his account of the Falklands campaign in 1982, has assembled hundreds of excerpts from the sound archives of the Imperial War Museum. Officers, rank-and-file troops, Australians, Americans, war widows, women in the munitions factories, and German soldiers too, all left oral testimony of their experiences, and these interviews provide the basis of the book. Arthur has put them in chronological and campaign order, and provided a general commentary, but beyond that, has left the rich and moving record to speak for itself.The sheer humdrum ordinariness of modern warfare--the mud and rain, the relentless loss of life and inevitability of death, the pointless routine of attrition--come over in the matter-of-fact recollections of so many. But so too does the humanity and morality of the ordinary soldier--a factor that rather belies the recent emphasis amongst some historians on how soldiers loved to kill. Arthur might have intruded more. No biographical information is given about the owners of these \"voices\", nor does he say when, where and how this oral testimony was gathered. Blurb courtesy of Amazon.Really facinating snapshots into the minds of all walks of life during the great war. Inspiring and humbling and often moving. Full of heroes. Fine work."}, {"userName": "Rod", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2306394-rod", "userReview": "A first-class, first-hand, first world war reference! The contributors, who were originally interviewed by the BBC, give life to the major events of the first world war. One of the most striking facts was the attitude of women to men in civilian clothes and the giving of white feathers of cowardice, often in error, to soldiers who were on leave, or to youngsters of fifteen or sixteen who were then encouraged to join up and die. One almost wishes that some of these people could have been plucked up and deposited in a trench for a day or two!Another incident that sticks in the mind was the account of the sighting, by a British company, of a large group of French soldiers in their brightly coloured uniforms, running down a road away from the front line. The British Officer ordered them to halt and when they ignored him he ordered his own troops to open fire and kill them. When the British proceeded a short distance they met clouds of mustard gas rolling down the road - ah, now that explained a lot."}], "description": "This unique landmark oral history uses first-hand accounts from ordinary men and women who were there. Gripping, poignant, surprising and even humorous, the personal experiences of these soldiers, civilians, marines and medics from both sides tell us what it was really like to live through what was supposed to be the war to end all wars. Skilfully assembled by acclaimed author and historian Max Arthur using the IWM\u2019s remarkable sound archive, Forgotten Voices of the Great War became an instant classic on first publication with close to half a million copies sold.In 1972, the Imperial War Museum began a momentous and important task. A team of academics, archivists and volunteers set about tracing First World War veterans and interviewing them in order to record the experiences of ordinary individuals in war. Since then the Sound Archive has grown to become the largest and most important oral history collections in the world. It now contains over 34,000 recordings, including interviews with veterans of both world wars \u2013 both service personnel and non-combatants \u2013 recordings relating to Britain and the Empire in the inter-war period 1919\u20131939, conflicts since 1945 and the Holocaust.In 2002, Ebury Press published the first edition of Forgotten Voices of the Great War. It was both the first time many of these recordings had been transcribed and published, and the only comprehensive oral history of the First World War. Twelve further books covering aspects of the Second World War, the Falklands and the Victoria Cross followed, selling well over a million copies to date.", "title": "Forgotten Voices of the Great War", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/143943.Forgotten_Voices_of_the_Great_War", "average": 4.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1396229977l/143943.jpg", "reviews": 80, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/83234.Max_Arthur", "name": "Max Arthur"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/482440.Imperial_War_Museum", "name": "Imperial War Museum"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "War", "War", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/143943.Forgotten_Voices_of_the_Great_War", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9403497-forgotten-voices-of-the-great-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/956070.Forgotten_Voices_of_the_Great_War", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17856538-forgotten-voices-of-the-great-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202801.Last_Post", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2805785-forgotten-voices-of-the-second-world-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8502924-last-of-the-few", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202802.Faces_of_World_War_I", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6093859-dambusters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
