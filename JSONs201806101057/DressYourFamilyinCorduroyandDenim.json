Out of everything he's produced (I've read all of his major work and only missed a few short pieces) this is my favorite David Sedaris book. Yet, I don't recommend it......not always, not to everyone. The subject matter can be too much for some people, especially if they've been told that David Sedaris is a humorist and then they encounter some the more depressing details of his real life experiences. I laugh my ass off at the bottom-feeder personalities and occasional bargain basement morals herein, but some people will wring their hands and cry, \"Oh how awful!\"Get over it and enjoy the ride, is my approach. The ride includes experiences of being gay and coming out (horrible and hilarious!), portraits of various family members that bring the people as vividly alive as any long-running sitcom is capable, and living on his own for the first time, which includes apartment living in general and specifically the trials of low-income housing.Sedaris is a master at autobiographical essays. These short form pieces about his life read like carnival folklore, so seemingly unreal at times it feels surreal. Some of his other books are not quite so warts-and-all. If you try Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim on for size, realize it may not suit you. Perhaps try on another first and ease your way into this strange fashion.Audiobook Note: Listening to Sedaris read the audiobook is a must. He wrote the stories, hell, he lived the stories, so he knows how they're to be read. I've listened to him enough now that I can not only read his work in his voice, but also accurately guess at the necessary inflection in new material. Yeah, it's a gift..."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/I think by this point it\u2019s pretty much common knowledge that I love David Sedaris like a fat kid I love cake and, well . . . . . \nDress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim might be my favorite collection yet. I could seriously kick myself for not only not trying audiobooks before this Fall, but also for not thinking of collections like these as something that would fit into my short commute time perfectly. We\u2019re talking true . . . . \nEven while in a stupid ass Fiat rather than a Volkswagen since mine decided to die like a whore on the corner a few months back. And when work got like WAAAAAAY too worky the other day and I was afraid I was going to full out pull a Milton . . . . \nOr a Leslie Knope . . . . \nI opted to schedule a mental health vacay day instead and went home to immerse myself in my favorite type of therapy this time of year \u2013 decorating Christmas trees (with an added bonus of listening to the soothing sounds of David\u2019s dysfunction this go \u2018round). Dress Your Family was a great blend of stories of the Sedaris children and parents (words cannot express how much I adore Sharon, their mother), the Sedaris children as adults, David and Hugh and everything in between. Thanks to the combo of some sort of sinus condition/basement dust I lugged upstairs along with the decorations, I laughed until I was overtaken by an emphysema-ish coughing fit/wheeze that may or may not have concluded with me urinating a bit on myself - and if THAT isn\u2019t an endorsement, I don\u2019t know what is. I\u2019ve put a hold on every other available Sedaris audio in order to get myself through the end of the year without (hopefully) causing bodily harm to anyone at work. Now I just have to deal with a cat who is terrified of Santa\u2019s impending visit after hearing the story of \u201c6 to 8 Black Men\u201d. . . . . \nNo it isn\u2019t. Read the story. Anyway, I keep telling him we don\u2019t live in Amsterdam so he doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about, but I think it\u2019s pretty obvious by the look on his face that he doesn\u2019t believe me . . . ."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "this is a book by david sedaris.shrug.i mean, what else am i supposed to say? it's not like he went out on a limb here and wrote a space opera or a bodice ripper. it's david sedaris. if you like him, you will probably like this one. if you don't, you probably won't.this is not my favorite of his collections, but i laughed out loud three times, which i think is pretty good. i like laughter.**one time, connor made david sedaris laugh. he has yet to write a story about this incident, but we are all holding our breaths and waiting."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/512643-michelle", "userReview": "I thought I was over David Sedaris. I don't mean that I don't like him. I do. His essays are funny, but after a while they all seem to run together. He mines the same territory again and again -- stories of growing up with his dysfunctional, quirky, yet lovable family. Stories of himself as the odd and awkward kid growing up and trying to figure out how to live in this world.I wasn\u2019t going to buy Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim in print, but I saw the audio version, read by Sedaris himself, on sale at CompUSA when they were going out of business and selling their entire inventory for cheap. I couldn\u2019t resist even though I much prefer to read books rather than to listen to them. I did nothing with it for more than a year until I decided I should listen to it while going for walks around my neighborhood.I found myself rolling my eyes, not laughing, and quickly becoming bored. Finally I had the idea to take the book with me when I drove places. I felt I would get through it much quicker that way and could finally move on to something else.It turned out that that was the way to listen to David Sedaris. Walking around the neighborhood while thinking about the pain in my hip and how at 38 years old I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to have a fucking hip replacement is no way to appreciate him. I just wanted to slap the shit out of him and his idiosyncratic family/neighbors/and everyone else he was talking about. Relaxed and driving on the freeway with his pleasant voice in my ear was the way to go. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that it made me want to listen to his books rather than read them, which was kind of a first for me.That being said, it\u2019s not going to come as a big surprise that this collection is more of the same types of stories we\u2019ve heard in the past, but I have to say that Sedaris really shines when he talks about his sister, Tiffany, and his brother, Paul (a.k.a. The Rooster). Those were my favorites in the collection. I was also sad to learn that Sedaris\u2019s mother, Sharon, has passed away. I\u2019ll never forget his Ya-Ya refusing to call Sharon by her name and stubbornly referring to her as \u201cThe Girl\u201d because she was pissed she wasn\u2019t Greek. And if you already know and love The Rooster, man are you in for a treat when Sedaris reads in Paul\u2019s voice. Something about this charming, well-spoken man saying the words \u201cShe had tubes coming out of her pussy\u201d in a thick southern accent cracked me up more than reading it on the page ever could."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david", "userReview": "So. David Sedaris. Well, let's be clear. Nobody with a funnybone can hate David Sedaris. And neither do I. But it has to be said - that last book (\"Dress your family in corduroy and denim\") was quite a disappointment. Judging by the number of people showing up for his readings here in San Francisco, and its lengthy sojourn on The New York Times bestseller list, it obviously did pretty well commercially. And, based on the enormous amount of accumulated goodwill from his earlier books, I don't begrudge DS his commercial success. Not one bit. Well, OK. Maybe just a little bit. Because, for the first time, in this collection, we see clear indications that Sedaris is bumping up against his limitations. How so? I think (and make no claim for the originality of this analysis) it's because Sedaris is at his best when he writes from the point of view of slightly marginalized outsider. In his earlier stuff, he was poor, he's gay and he managed to achieve a tone of bemusement in reporting what went on around him that was completely hilarious. In the face of increasing commercial success, the edge that was conferred by his being poor became harder to maintain. But he and his boyfriend moved to France, thereby achieving automatic outsider status, and Sedaris was able to mine this for comedy gold (his accounts of misadventures while learning French are truly funny, and credit must be given for the way in which he makes the comedy seem so effortless). But that's his previous book Me Talk Pretty One Day. Problem is, the whole 'marginalized outsider' position seems less and less plausible for an author whose books spend months on the best seller list. Similarly, after a few years in France, the forces of assimilation are bound to cut down on the number of amusing misunderstandings funny enough to be worth writing about. This leaves one other area which Sedaris has mined fruitfully in previous books - anecdotes about his family. Indeed, the majority of the stories in this latest collection are family-based anecdotes. However, the stories in this collection do not come close to matching the wit and poignancy of those in earlier books, suggesting that this vein of inspiration may be close to being tapped out. Hardly surprising - any author would lead with the funniest material; this collection has occasional flashes of wit, but never reaches the 'laugh-out-loud' quality of the earlier books. Several pieces in this collection (describing his brother's wedding, his job one summer at the State Fair) are downright pedestrian, and a couple of pieces just fall flat - ruminations about apartment-hunting while visiting the Anne Frank house, accounts of visits with two of his sisters, whose feelings about being featured as bit-players in this, or subsequent collections are decidedly mixed. It's to Sedaris's credit that he too is ambivalent on this point, but his soul-searching on the issue doesn't make for interesting reading. One of Yeats's later poems is called \"The Circus Animals' Desertion\"; in it, he bemoans the fact that the themes which inspired him early in his career have lost their inspirational power. \"Dress your family in corduroy and denim\" supports the notion that David Sedaris may be experiencing similar difficulties. But don't count him out yet. His previous books estalished Sedaris as a hilarious, extremely talented writer. Anyone can have one bad book. Let's hope he will leave it at that."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Okay so the Chip Kidd covers usually ruins authors like this for me. The covers almost ooze Wes Andersonian Americana... I will let prejudices slip past.So this writer has a following and it is understandable. This guy CAN WRITE. And topping that: he can write short stories. I am very ambivalent about short vignettes or even the lofty novella: why don't writers just extend the s**t out of whatever story they are writing to fit the perimeters of the novel? O so close.Sedaris observes, writes. He's underwhelmingly unextraordinary, but his voice sures gots sass.I have known someone the exact prototype of this Woody Allenesque guy: all style no substance. Yes-- keen, keen like a knife. But what ties it all? Why are these so damn popular? Sometimes, the collective I.Q. ...I want to read more of this self-centered pedant. He ain't all that, though.

Blood Work and La Nuit of the Dead are put together so perfectly. Sedaris creates a series of misguided attempts at human connection that seem doomed to fail through selfishness or insecurity, but somehow don\u2019t. Sedaris is so good at exposing the frailty of those emotional connections without ever doubting that they can still sustain our relationships. He makes me relate to even the most impossibly awkward and painful situations. Every time I read it I think, \u201cThat\u2019s so ME!\u201d And then realize that I\u2019m not a gay man living in rural France, fearing zombies and drowning a mouse in a bucket at midnight. And yet somehow I can still not only relate to the situation, but feel the familiarity of it. The parts about his brother make me miss my brother horribly. Sedaris is so great at showing that most of our love for each other doesn\u2019t lie in our similarities, but in the strength of our shared history and our sheer will to maintain the relationship. This can seem either damaged and pathetic or comforting and hopeful. I\u2019m going with the latter."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger", "userReview": "Another good collection of short stories by David Sedaris!3.5 stars! I decided to do the audiobook for Dress Your Family In Corduroy And Denim and I\u2019m glad I did. At times, his voice bugged me a bit. It was more indifferent then I liked, and I know he was going for deadpan. But at the same time, David Sedaris is cynical, funny and does the best job of explaining his crazy family and all his neurotic thoughts. Boy does he have a lot of neurotic thoughts!! Ha! I think we all do at times.His humor is not for everyone though. He is often dark and dry, and you often wonder if he\u2019s being funny or truthful. I enjoy this type of humor for its subtlety and honesty.The short stories that I enjoyed the most were:1.\tThe neighborhood family that didn\u2019t watch television2.\tChristmas in the Netherlands (I laughed out loud at least 2 to 3 times!!!)3.\tThe misunderstanding erotic house cleaning service4.\tHis brother\u2019s wedding.It seems that most of the family members are funny on their own but add them all together and it\u2019s a great recipe for some good chuckles!"}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/368858-adam", "userReview": "Honestly, I tried to like this book. Maybe it's one of those that, at page 100, kicks everything glorious into overdrive, making you gleeful and giddy and full of delight at reading it. Maybe I should have read further and waited longer. But, you see, I only really started to read this because it seemed hip at the time to do so. I'm not too sure that I care enough about maintaining some form of imagined quasi-hipness to make myself sit through the rest of it. There.

What if no topics were off limits, no person's feelings or privacy taken into consideration, no personal flaws purposely left unmentioned in order to be protected from ridicule?You would probably write exactly like David Sedaris.To actually write like David Sedaris, however, you'd also have to be intelligent, impeccably attentive to details and most importantly - uncommonly funny. With that winning combination, Sedaris's unencumbered writing creates a truly fascinating look into his life and way of thinking.Take, for instance, a neighborhood family that supposedly doesn't watch any television. You've know them, or at least heard about them. But have you hidden yourself in bushes outside their house watching them at night? Sedaris spied on this family with fascination, watching them interact at the dinner table during the evenings and feeling sorry for the absence of television in their lives. After watching one of their children at school being left out of a joke that made reference to a TV show, Sedaris writes, \"It occurred to me that they needed a guide, someone who could point out all the things they were unable to understand. I could have done it on weekends, but friendship would have taken away their mystery and interfered with the good feeling I got from pitying them. So I kept my distance.\"Then, when this same family showed up for Trick-Or-Treating the day after Halloween, Sedaris expresses what must be universally believed: \"Asking for candy on Halloween was called trick-or-treating, but asking for candy on November first was called begging, and it made people uncomfortable. This was one of the things you were supposed to learn simply by being alive, and it angered me that the Tomkeys did not understand it.\"The subject matter varies wildly from chapter to chapter, but each contains Sedaris's hilarious spin on what would probably appear to most outsiders, nothing to write home about. Although there are several uncomfortable chapters that touch on situations involving his homosexuality, his willingness to expose himself, and, I suppose his willingness to expose his loved ones, give his writing an important and appreciated perspective. It's so enjoyably honest! I mean, he writes about going through the Anne Frank House while simultaneous apartment hunting and wanting to live there because it's \"cute.\" Totally irreverent. But when he talks about ripping out the wood stove so that the fireplace would be the focal point and thinking the attic, with its charming dormer windows, could be his office...it ends up being really funny.The best chapter for me was called Six To Eight Black Men when he describes in laugh-out-loud detail the Christmas traditions in the Netherlands. Of course he begins the chapter by pointing out some of the more unusual local gun laws in various states of the USA, mentioning as an interesting fact that in Michigan - blind people are allowed to hunt...alone. As the chapter nears its end, and you wonder what the two stories have to do with each other, he finishes by sharing his thoughts while sitting in a Dutch train station. \"I couldn't help but feel second-rate. Yes, the Netherlands was a small country, but it had six to eight black men and a really good bedtime story. Being a fairly competitive person, I felt jealous, then bitter.

No, non \u00e8 utile, per\u00f2 si presuppone che abbia l'unico scopo di divertirti. Per\u00f2 davvero, se ad esempio io lo incrociasse per strada, non \u00e8 che perderei come minimo un battito urlando \"Oddio, David! Oddio! Ora che ti ho rincontrato la mia vita ha di nuovo un senso!\" e altre fangirlate simili, probabilmente me ne uscirei con una faccetta sorpresa e un \"Oh guarda, Sedaris!\" e lo saluterei continuando per la mia strada. Quello che in questo momento \u00e8 il mio dubbio atroce \u00e8..perch\u00e9 Sedaris dovrebbe spiccare? Voglio dire, non so se avete idea di quanti libri in lingua non vengono nemmeno tradotti, si presuppone che quelli che arrivano fino a noi abbiano almeno una marcia in pi\u00f9. Sedaris \u00e8 il classico tipino con cui fai piacevolmente quattro chiacchiere, e raccontandoti della sua vita privata (perch\u00e9 l'intero libro si fonda su episodi singolari che gli sono capitati, o che sono capitati ad uno sfortunato membro della sua famiglia messo in ballo) ti fa ..sorridere, ecco. A me Sedaris fa ridere di rado, che ne so, ogni trenta pagine. Purtroppo non ho neanche dietro una cultura sulla letteratura umoristica per dire se Sedaris \u00e8 veramente importante o no, e neanche per fare tanti confronti. Per\u00f2 a fine libro ti rimane il dubbio del \"ma alla fine quanto \u00e8 stato piacevole? mi dimenticher\u00f2 del libro nel giro di quanto? un mese, due mesi, o addirittura poche settimane? o forse sto sottovalutando Frocia Poppins?..essere o non essere?\" S\u00ec, essere o non essere, utile o non utile, divertente o no, uno potrebbe anche dire \"s\u00ec, mi fa piacere, ma chi diavolo \u00e8 'sto Sedaris?\"David Sedaris \u00e8 un individuo del '56 con pochi capelli sulla testa, noto come umorista radiofonico, scrittore di bestsellers (odio questo termine) che usa la sua stessa persona e la sua stessa vita per fare ironia, coinvolgendo praticamente qualsiasi persona che abbia un rapporto stretto con lui. Se per caso avrete il piacere di conoscerlo, NON raccontategli nulla di sconveniente, potreste finire su un libro. Tant'\u00e8 vero che i suoi familiari hanno il terrore di confidarsi con lui. Li capisco.Comunque le sue raccolte pi\u00f9 famose sono Me parlare bello un giorno e Holidays on Ice.Leggo in diverse recensioni che nel libro che ho letto \u00e8 un po' sottotono. Aspiro a leggere Me parlare bello un giorno, il titolo gi\u00e0 \u00e8 invitante di suo.Per\u00f2 per adesso ho avuto il piacere di leggere solo Mi raccomando: tutti vestiti bene, che devo ammettere che s\u00ec, una lettura molto carina, ma non mi \u00e8 parso nulla di pi\u00f9. Una di quelle letture che mandi gi\u00f9 senza problemi, ma difficilmente ti rimane in testa nei giorni a venire, magari ti verr\u00e0 in mente un giorno come tutti gli altri, e penserai a un particolare episodio del libro. Personalmente sono quasi sicura che ripenser\u00f2 a quello strano tipo, Martin, che aveva prenotato un domestico a luci rosse. Voglio dire, quanti scrupoli bisogna farsi per inventare un servizio di pulizie a luci rosse? Mi rivolgo a Martin: amico mio, ma perch\u00e9 non vai al sodo e chiami un..oddio, qual \u00e8 l'equivalente maschile di prostituta? ..ma esiste?! Prostitut..no. Oh mannaggia, non ne ho idea. Il problema l'ho gi\u00e0 presentato prima: le risate me le ha strappate di rado, per la maggior parte del tempo si \u00e8 limitato a farmi sorridere. Di certo il punto forte di Sedaris sta nel farsi conoscere dal lettore, aprirsi a lui, non aver problemi a prendersi in giro da solo, ridendo insieme al lettore dei suoi difetti pi\u00f9 strani (mai avuto il bisogno ossessivo e incomprensibile del dover toccare la testa a qualcuno?). Comunque il meglio del libro \u00e8 la copertina. Cio\u00e8, voi avreste il coraggio di mettere il davanzale di una Barbie come copertina, e DIETRO il suo bel culetto di plastica?PS: il fidanzato di David mi sta sulle palle.

It starts off when he was a young boy and he has to give up his Halloween candy to the neighbors. He then stuffed as much candy in his face as possible so he wouldn't have to share it. I knew right after this chapter that I was going to like this book. As you read further in the book you learn all about his family like his brother, Paul, the rooster. Different events occur in this book that tell you a lot about David and his family. Like in the chapter the Girl Next Door, David meets a young girl neighbor and begins spending time with her and discovers she doens't know what France is, so he helps her with maps and such. I personally liked the chapter \"Rooster at the Hitchin' Post\" because of all the humor in it and it shows the relationship David has between his brother and him.David Sedaris tells the story of his life very well, and in a funny way. I would recommend this book to everyone because it is a great book to read over and over, as I did with many of the chapters."}, {"userName": "Michael Kneeland", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1297814-michael-kneeland", "userReview": "Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim delves further into the fascinating, hilarious, and otherwise utterly bizarre life of David Sedaris and his family. This collection of his essays is quite good--among my favorites of his--because throughout most of it, he manages to find a moving balance between the tragic and the comic. Take, for instance, \"The Ship Shape,\" about how his family almost bought a summer home, but ultimately lost out on the chance because of his father's fickleness with money. The essay starts off humorously enough, with plenty of zany details, like the absurd names his family comes up with for the summer home in question. But by the end, we have a rather melancholic picture painted of the family, headed by a father who would like to give his family something nice like a summer home on the beach, but is just too fickle to actually go through with it.Then there is \"Hejira,\" about how Sedaris' father kicked him out of the house seemingly because he was an unemployed college dropout whose number of bong hits surpassed his number of trips out of the house, but really, we learn, because he was gay. We have plenty of funny anecdotes throughout, giving us hilarious images of Sedaris sitting stoned in his room listening to the same Joni Mitchell record over and over again, but by the end, we see ultimately see a father who finds his son so unacceptable that he removes him from the situation. From reading his other works, we know that Sedaris and his father eventually mended ways, but as \"Hejira\" closes, we only see a depressed young man wanting to be acknowledged for being, as he puts it, \"special.\"Of course, there is also plenty of outright absurdity, such as \"Six to Eight Black Men,\" which I have my students read each year during the holiday season; and \"Rooster at the Hitchin' Post,\" which is on the outset about his obnoxious, foul-mouthed younger brother's wedding, but we eventually see is about the relationship between Sedaris and his brother. These are wholly hilarious, and do well to offset much of the depressing downheartedness emoted from the essays mentioned above.Fans of Sedaris will certainly appreciate this collection of essays. Newbies may find his life and family a bit too bizarre to digest at first, but after pushing through will realize the palette of emotions mentioned earlier. After all, while Sedaris' life is strange and usually utterly absurd, it is still life nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Jesi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3954096-jesi", "userReview": "So, I got about 7% into the book Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim before just not being able to listen to it anymore. It, quite literally, was making me sick to listen to it. The main characters are shallow, \"broken,\" and... well, the stuff of sitcom characters. They're (to me) sick, but \"normal\" which was making my head explode. I suppose, in a way, you could say that the book was \"dark humor,\" which is pretty hit or miss to me.The family really could have been spawned for Married With Children in the 70's. The mother was an alcoholic, the father was an uninterested has-been-Golden Boy who's now completely useless and disrespected by his family (maybe deservedly so, as he's the kind to offer up \"promises\" like \"maybe we should take a cruise to the Greek Isles\" and never living up to them.) And, that's only the beginning. The rest of the family is just as \"bad.\"Now, I realize that for a stereotype, this is the \"normal American family,\" but... does this mean that we should accept it as so? Maybe that's the point of this book - to make us look at what's taken for granted as \"normal\" and have it be a wake up call. Maybe, where the funny lies in this \"humor\" is what Valentine Michael Smith would say \"it hurts too much to cry about, so we laugh.\"I don't want to cry about society. And, I can't honestly laugh at this, because it's too true. So, instead, I get this sick feeling - like looking at some car wreck. A car wreck that others think is funny.

However, Corduroy and Denim is just a series of narcissistic vignettes. I don't enjoy that sort of thing. Keep your therapy private. I would've kept on reading if Sedaris was funny, but he isn't, despite his reputation for humor. How on earth is he supposed to be funny? I have fairly eclectic taste in humor (Woody Allen, Wodehouse, Amis, Pinkwater, Richard Powell, Robert Taylor...on down to old Dave Barry), but I couldn't find an iota of humor in the microscope-on-the-Sedaris-Family approach. If anything, I found it all fairly dreary and way too familiar in terms of the Jewish family angst.I'll probably give some of his other books a try, but I don't have high hopes.

My wife (who had never heard of Sedaris before) and I were driving home last winter when the piece was played on NPR, and we were both nearly in tears. Fun stuff!!!"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "3.5 stars A few years ago, for Christmas, I bought my mother a copy of Me Talk Pretty One Day. I'd never read David Sedaris, hell, I didn't know how to pronounce his name (seh-darr-is? seh-dair-is? sed-uh-ris?)... Well, obviously, I still don't. But, I picked it up and read one of the stories and laughed, and I thought my mom would like it, and so I got it for her. I have no idea if she read it. So, on a whim, I downloaded this one, and stuck it on my ipod, thinking that little vignette stories would be OK to read on such a small screen. Standing in line at the store, or on break at work, whatever. Only, I got hooked, and read it pretty much straight through. On my ipod. Why didn't I just transfer it to my Nook, you ask? Because I'm dumb. Duh. Anyway, there are quite a lot of stories in this book... but they are all over the place. Some are funny, some are more serious, some seem to have no point at all. It seems that, this being (from what I can tell) Sedaris' 5th book, and theoretically being an initiated fan, I should be familiar with his family and their quirks and whatnot, and not have really needed chronology to be a factor. And... I guess I didn't, despite this being my initiation. But it might've helped add some coherency or fluidity or something. And, maybe just a teensy explanation of who Hugh is, at least the first time he's mentioned in this book. I mean, I am intelligent (despite my previous claim to the contrary above), so I was able to gather from context that he must be David's partner, but I think it's not TOO much to ask for a little explanation. My favorite stories by far were \"Us and Them\", \"Full House\", and \"Baby Einstein\". David's brother Paul is HILARIOUS, vulgar, and fucking awesome. He made me laugh constantly talking about Paul. Like this bit: When my sis\u00adters and I even\u00adtu\u00adally left home, it seemed like a nat\u00adural pro\u00adgres\u00adsion \u2014 young adults shift\u00ading from one en\u00advi\u00adron\u00adment to the next. While our de\u00adpar\u00adtures had been rel\u00ada\u00adtively pain\u00adless, Paul\u2019s was like re\u00adleas\u00ading a do\u00admes\u00adtic an\u00adi\u00admal into the wild. He knew how to plan a meal but dis\u00adplayed a re\u00admark\u00adable lack of pa\u00adtience when it came time for the ac\u00adtual cook\u00ading. Frozen din\u00adners were often eaten ex\u00adactly as sold, the Sal\u00adis\u00adbury steak amount\u00ading to a stick\u00adless meat Pop\u00adsi\u00adcle. I phoned one night just as he was lean\u00ading a fam\u00adily pack of frozen chicken wings against the back door. He\u2019d for\u00adgot\u00adten to de\u00adfrost them and was now at\u00adtempt\u00ading to stomp the solid mass into three 6-inch por\u00adtions, which he\u2019d stack in a pile and force into his toaster oven.I heard the sin\u00adgu\u00adlar sound of boot against crys\u00adtal\u00adlized meat and lis\u00adtened as my brother panted for breath. \u201cGod\u00addam . . . fuck\u00ading . . . chicken . . . wings.\u201dI called again the fol\u00adlow\u00ading evening and was told that after all that work, the chicken had been spoiled. It tasted like fish, so he threw it away and called it a night. A few hours later, hav\u00ading de\u00adcided that spoiled chicken was bet\u00adter than no chicken at all, he got out of bed, stepped out\u00adside in his un\u00adder\u00adpants, and pro\u00adceeded to eat the left\u00adovers di\u00adrectly from the garbage can.I was mor\u00adti\u00adfied. \u201cIn your un\u00adder\u00adpants?\u201d\u201cDamned straight,\u201d he said. \u201cI ain\u2019t get\u00adting dressed up to eat no fish-assed-tast\u00ading chicken.\u201dI wor\u00adried about my brother stand\u00ading in his briefs and eat\u00ading spoiled poul\u00adtry by moon\u00adlight. I wor\u00adried when told he\u2019d passed out in a park\u00ading lot and awoken to find a stranger\u2019s ini\u00adtials writ\u00adten in lip\u00adstick on his ass, but I never wor\u00adried he\u2019d be able to make a liv\u00ading.Or this one: Kathy was in labor for fif\u00adteen hours be\u00adfore the doc\u00adtors de\u00adcided to per\u00adform a ce\u00adsarean. The news was de\u00adliv\u00adered to the wait\u00ading room, and when the time came my fa\u00adther looked at his watch, say\u00ading, \u201cWell, I guess they should be carv\u00ading her up right about now.\u201d Then he went home to feed his dog. By this point, nam\u00ading the child Lou was on par with nam\u00ading it Adolph or Beelze\u00adbub, but all three were dis\u00adqual\u00adi\u00adfied when the baby turned out to be a girl.They named her Made\u00adlyn, which was short\u00adened to Maddy by the time she reached the in\u00adcu\u00adba\u00adtor. I was in a hotel in Port\u00adland, Ore\u00adgon, at the time and re\u00adceived the news from my brother, who called from the re\u00adcov\u00adery room. His voice was soft and melodic, not much more than a whis\u00adper. \u201cMama\u2019s got some tubes stick\u00ading out of her pussy, but it ain\u2019t no big thing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s lying back, lit\u00adtle Maddy\u2019s suck\u00ading on her titty just as happy as she can be.\u201d This was the new, gen\u00adtler Paul: same vo\u00adcab\u00adu\u00adlary, but the tone was sweeter and sea\u00adsoned with a sense of won\u00adder. The ce\u00adsarean had been un\u00adpleas\u00adant, but after be\u00admoan\u00ading the months wasted in Lamaze class, he grew re\u00adflec\u00adtive. \u201cSome is cut loose and oth\u00aders come out on their own self, but take heed, brother: hav\u00ading a baby is a fuck\u00ading mir\u00ada\u00adcle.\u201dClassy. I love it. There were some laugh out loud moments, a few of them in public, much to The Boy's dismay (apparently me staring into my palm and laughing like a lunatic is awkward for him!) but I did think that there would be quite a bit more humor, actually. There were some stories that had a definite tone of seriousness, despite the humor that seemed almost unintentional. I'm not complaining, but this is maybe a time when having a set outline would have been better. One expects to encounter issues trekking from childhood, through the teen years, and finally on to adulthood... let alone MATURITY. But the stories just being thrown in willy nilly was off-putting. One minute I'm reading about Turkish Santa and his 6-8 black men, and then the next I'm reading about David being evicted from his father's house for no reason other than being gay, and the next we're reading about domestic tranquility - or the lack thereof. The stories can be poignant though. I especially liked this line:Movie char\u00adac\u00adters might chase each other through the fog or race down the stairs of burn\u00ading build\u00adings, but that\u2019s for be\u00adgin\u00adners. Real love amounts to with\u00adhold\u00ading the truth, even when you\u2019re of\u00adfered the per\u00adfect op\u00adpor\u00adtu\u00adnity to hurt some\u00adone\u2019s feelings.Overall, I liked it. Did I love it? No, but I could have. Will I read more of Sedaris' books? Yes, I will. I like his style and his quirkiness and his blunt self-observations and lack of give-a-shitery about them. It makes for entertaining reading, that's for sure."}], "description": "David Sedaris plays in the snow with his sisters. He goes on vacation with his family. He gets a job selling drinks. He attends his brother's wedding. He mops his sister's floor. He gives directions to a lost traveler. He eats a hamburger. He has his blood sugar tested. It all sounds so normal, doesn't it? In this collection of essays, Sedaris lifts the corner of ordinary life, revealing the absurdity teeming below its surface. His world is alive with obscure desires and hidden motives--a world where forgiveness is automatic and an argument can be the highest form of love.
