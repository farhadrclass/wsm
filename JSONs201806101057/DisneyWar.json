The author is invited inside the Disney organization to find out what makes it tick...and discovers it's a time bomb.The opening is the Disney version we've always imagined, with the author experiencing a magical moment while working as a beloved Disney character at one of the Parks. He is then invited to record the inner workings of the Michael Eisner regime...almost at the exact moment when things start to go horribly wrong.What was especially amazing to me is how the author stayed inside to record this. Disney has always been incredibly protective of its brand. Yet, unfolding in these pages is the break with Roy Disney, the court battle with Jeffrey Katzenberg, the war with Steve Jobs, the hiring and firing of Michael Ovitz, and the dethroning of Eisner himself. It is not unlike watching a spectacular train wreck.The author keeps all of the players distinct and the narrative freely flowing. At many points, I kept wondering how he was allowed to stay. But, stay he did and the story is riveting.There is almost a Shakespearian feel to Eisner's fall. He is obviously a man with tremendous business sense, and yet he was oblivious to the disaster forming all around him. This is truly a remarkable book."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james", "userReview": "I feel the need to explain why on earth I would read a 570 page book about Disney under the leadership of Michael Eisner. Disney itself has never held much attraction. When I was four or five I watched what my parents no doubt figured was an educational film about North American mountain cats. Suffice to say the dad dies first and the mother didn't have long either. Wherupon the cubs are relentlessly chased by human evil doers. I think at this stage I was in hysterics and cannot remember another thing about the movie except a deep sense of why would anyone do this to me. Life moves on, one forgives but never forgets. My daughter at age three through some process of atmospheric osmosis becomes very aware of Disney and the revulsion towards simpering princesses grows, but along that a grudging respect. One only has to watch the satanic imbecility of those pony fairies spawn of a focus groups decision to lump everything three year old girls like into one revolting gloop, to see that the quality is oh so much better. And honestly I know all the words to let it go. So grudging respect for Disney aside why read the book? Well I needed to read something where I absolutely could not care less what the people in the book did or what happened to them. I had just read a book about a guy who gets part of his face blown off along with his limbs and spends the rest of his life in purgatory. I needed low stakes, I needed the mundane, I needed corporate politics in all their numbing detail and boy does this book deliver. I loved the hated internal corporate strategy team, the constant stream of corporate executives fired for threatening the ceo if only in his imagination, the stream of good and bad decisions by a man who was pretty decent with a number of flaws. Stuff that worked and stuff that did not. The fact that the worst thing that happened in this book is that someone gets fired and goes on to do something much more fun. Cannot recommend the therapeutic properties of this book more highly. For those who say this review is light in content at least it is spoiler free, after all I wouldn't want to ruin the suspense of why survivor is on Cbs not abc for anyone."}, {"userName": "Darcy Conroy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3603875-darcy-conroy", "userReview": "I listened to this on audiobook, so I'll discuss the content and the production separately.Content: Maybe it's because I'm a trained historian, but I found myself mumbling, sometimes shouting at my kindle: \"according to who?\" \"says who?\" \"you can't know that was what happened!\" There was just too much dramatization in this non-fiction book, too much certainty about people's thoughts, beliefs and conversations to which the author was not privy. I couldn't relax and trust it. Some dialogue is needed to break up non-fiction, sure, but that should be clear transcriptions of interviews about the incidents (preferably from more than one point of view), or recordings from the time. If the author is going to insist upon dramatizing conversations and phone calls (including stage directions!), it needs to made clear upon whose information the author is crafting his scenes - without such attribution, the reader can neither trust the information as truth, nor enjoy it as biased gossip. I hate to say this (as someone who directed audio books for seven years) but I might have to get a print copy out of the library to see if it works better on the page than in audio - perhaps Stewart used footnotes to attribute/explain the liberties he took with dramatizations (though it should be in the main text.)Audio production:The production is not great. Every gap between sentences, paragraphs and even chapters has been viciously removed, often disturbing the flow of the narration and allowing no space for the reader to reflect and absorb. I, personally, found the Lawlor's accent and timbre a little strident for long listening, but that's subjective. What was disturbing was Lawlor's raging case of 'tag lag' - when a narrator allows the emotion of dialogue to continue into the tag so, \" \"Oh no!\" she said.\" becomes \" \"Oh no,\" she said!\" It's not a problem on occasion (though a good director aims not to let any slip through) but it's constant in this book (and probably made worse when the listener is pissed off by the dramatization anyway!) All in all, I think this book probably suffered for being made into audio :("}, {"userName": "j", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-j", "userReview": "I'm sure it comes as no surprise that even a quote family-friendly unquote company like Disney has a sordid underbelly. What mega-corporation these days doesn't (just a tip, if you enjoy Diet Coke, I wouldn't google their international business practices too hard; it's not pretty).Disneywar isn't quite that kind of book -- we're not traveling into the sweatshops where orphans with bleeding fingers sew buttons on Mickey's overalls -- but it does air a lot of dirty laundry about the 20-year period in which Michael Eisner took the company from an also-ran in danger of being sold off to the mega-conglomerate we know and love, before his ever-growing ego and focus on the bottom line began to erode the brand and drive Disney animation into the dirt. I found all of the details immensely entertaining. If you have a favorite Disney movie from that era, it is probably discussed here in detail, from Little Mermaid and The Lion King to massive pirate movie failures like Treasure Planet and pirate movie successes like those Johnny Depp flicks. The scope is impressive (note the page count -- I listened to the audiobook and it was something like 25 hours), covering boardroom coups, theme park development, merchandizing snafus, the battle for Pixar (Eisner's downfall!) and the rise, fall and rise of the ABC network [they hit big and then overexposed Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and passed on a chance at Survivor (whoops!)].Unfortunately a lot of it is probably a bit out of date by now -- I read it in 2006 when Eisner's walk of shame away from the board of directors (kicked out through the efforts of no less than Roy Disney himself) was still pretty fresh -- but if you like movie industry gossip, it's fascinating stuff.Facebook 30 Day Book Challenge Day 26: Favorite non-fiction book."}, {"userName": "Ingrid", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4862907-ingrid", "userReview": "I initially chose this book because I am fascinated with all things Disney-namely the history of animation and its business wheelings and dealings. I was hoping to get an insider look at how the decisions to many of the elements of my childhood came about, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm going to be honest and say that I picked up the audio book to listen on my commutes to and from work, so I didn't technically read the book myself. Having said that, I think that had I not been on those long rides listening to the narrator I doubt I'd have gotten past the first few pages because it can be extremely tedious at times. The initial half about Eisner's rise to the top of Disney was very much engaging, and I was excited to get through it. Once it hit the halfway mark however, (that is, once David Katzenberg left), I quickly realized a once interesting book was becoming dull and unappealing. Towards the end of the first half the book went into Eisner and Katzenberg's falling out, which sounded more like a middle school feud in the bathroom; it had drama and gossip, and then it just became excessive. The pace really slowed down and unfortunately, instead of ending with a bang, was a dud."}, {"userName": "Seth Brady", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32818361-seth-brady", "userReview": "Wow! More internal drama then you could possibly imagine!What a great book. I had no idea how much went on behind the scenes during Michael Eisner's 20 year reign over The Walt Disney Company.It chronicles in depth the movement driving his first joining of the company in 1984 (ironically by two board members who fought tenaciously for his ouster 20 years later!), the rise of Disney's 1990s animation renaissance with Jeffrey Katzenberg (think Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King) and later viciously spiteful fall out, the bizarre and costly one year Michael Ovitz debacle, manipulation, coercion, and exploitation of a spineless Board that would never be tolerated in today's climate, expansion of the parks and the addition of the budget-busting EuroDisney, the death of Frank Wells (which many claim marked the end for Eisner), as well as the acquisition of ABC and the $5B struggle to make the purchase of ABC Family appear like a success. \u00a0The book culminates in the hugely contentious battle behind the scenes and in the public eye, putting former Board members -- including Roy Disney himself -- against Eisnet (completely reversing his efforts two decades previously to put him in power).This book really makes you wonder what the company is really like today under Bob Iger. \u00a0While some creative tension is good and can yield strong results, the story behind the massive expansion of this company, its content, global merchandising, expansive theme parks, and he shocking tales of pure financial and power-mad hubris makes you really wonder if he ends chili justify the means.This is the first book I've read in a long time where despite the huge length, I really didn't want it to end. In fact, the author should consider releasing an updated version with a new afterward highlighting what went on in the last 10 years since the end of the book (something I'd definitely come back to read)!"}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany", "userReview": "Stewart takes a fascinating in-depth look at the structure and politics of the Walt Disney Company, focusing on the years Michael Eisner was in power. Reporting in a straight \"these-are-the-facts\" manner, you still get a breathtakingly dramatic portrait of Eisner: His creative, younger years of success, partnered with talented people, and his gradual loss of his sense of reality as he begins to see himself as the omnipotent king of the Disney empire, and the natural heir of Walt Disney himself. People who have grown up seeing Disney movies, going to the theme parks and, for the last 15 years at least, hearing a parent blame Eisner for all that is wrong with Disney, this offers a more nuanced (but in the end, not much less incriminating) picture. (I'm not sure how many people did grow up like that, but that's what made the book cool for me.)For Disney fans who have just been dismayed at the declining quality and loss of creativity and attention to detail in Disney products, this is still a captivating behind-the-scenes look at the politicking behind Disney movies, Broadway productions, television moves, and theme parks. And for those not particularly interested in Disney at all, it still reads almost as a fast-packed corporate thriller through the attempted takeover by Comcast, the near collapse of the Disney/Pixar partnership, Roy Disney and Stanley Gold's resignation and \"Save Disney\" campaign, and Eiser's eventual overthrow. Stewart's comparison of Eisner to the doomed, egomaniac kings (which comes only at the very end) is brilliant."}, {"userName": "Joseph", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11085771-joseph", "userReview": "Disney War is encyclopedic in its scope and coverage of the Michael Eisner-era Walt Disney Company. It begins by providing a good background into the situation that brought Eisner to Disney from both his own career leading up to his hiring and the leadership and creative vacuum left after Walt Disney's death.It then details the rise and fall of Eisner with every machination with a complete cast of partners, associates, and subordinates. What the reader is treated to is a wonderfully entertaining and riveting inside history of the Walt Disney Company from 1984 to 2004. The author also frames the larger situation by drawing parallels to a Machiavellian or Shakespearean plotline where the Disney management\u2019s hubris is met with as dramatic a fall as its rise.It also takes great pains to provide a very balanced approach. Often, it provides two or more sides to the most contentious moments in the company's history.

Disney allowed James Stewart unprecedented access to both Michael Eisner (CEO) and Roy Disney, current and former Disney executives and board members, as well as thousands of pages of never before seen letters, memos, transcripts, and other documents. Little did they know what would ensue - unprecedented success in the 80's and early 90's, and never before seen governance and in-fighting at such a public and iconic company. Disneywar is much more than just a lesson on how not to set up governance committees and corporate boards of directors. Even if you have no interest in these topics, this is a fascinating behind the scenes look at the incredible run Disney had from 1984 - 1994 within animated movies, theme parks, programming, and creativity and the unraveling of this success from 1994 - 2004 through poor acquisitions, micromanagement and in-house fighting amongst employees. Couple of my favorite parts of this book included:*The turnaround of the animation division that led to classics like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast, Lion King, etc*The power struggle between Jeff Katzenberg and Michael Eisner and the unraveling of their 20 year relationship*Acquisition of ABC and ABC Family and their inability to revive it*Access to the programming decisions on hits like Who Wants to Be A Millionaire, Desperate Housewives, and Lost as well as their decisions to pass up hits like Survivor and CSI*Michael Eisner's dominating personality and dictatorship form of management, leading him to alienate himself from nearly every senior executive at Disney*Eisner's cronyism in selecting directors, and how screwed up the governance was at DisneyIt's difficult to judge Eisner for his performance. He's a talented creative mind with a knack for knowing what the public wants in shows / movies, but clearly lacked management skillsets to empower the other critical minds. There are numerous examples of his lack of ethics with how he treated some employees, and he made several massive mistakes (Pixar, Katzenberg, Employment Contracts). Nonetheless, he made Disney shareholders (and himself in the process) a ton of money in the 1990's and to be CEO at a public company anywhere for 20 years means you've done something right.Highly recommend this book as a business book, but also a fascinating read for Disney fans of the 1990's and 2000's."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/293178-caroline", "userReview": "I never thought I'd find a business book on the inner workings of corporate executives interesting, but then these corporate executives do work for Disney - and that makes it more interesting than most multi-million dollar corporations, if only because of the dichotomy between its public image and the machinations of executives behind the scenes.This book charts the twenty years of Michael Eisner as CEO of the Walt Disney Corporation, how he went from being the saviour of the company to more or less the Anti-Christ. If nothing else it's a very credible tale of how power corrupts.As long as Frank Wells, the Disney chairman, was alive, things worked, if only because Wells was able to serve as a check on Eisner's power, the only one who could, the one who smoothed over the ruffled feathers and was in a position to question Eisner's decisions. Once Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994 there was no-one to hold Eisner back. He took on Wells' position himself, despite pressure to name a successor, and became increasingly autocratic, positioning himself in the role of the natural heir to Walt Disney.This book could almost be the handbook on how not to perform as CEO. Eisner seemed to subscribe to the divide-and-conquer technique: he would force employees to report back to him on their bosses; he would tell one executive another one had said such-and-such to him and vice versa; he would second-guess and micromanage every decision; he would put executives in untenable positions and then blame them for failing; he was incredibly jealous of his position and anyone who was posited as his successor swiftly found the rug was pulled from under them and an exit was being arranged; he recouped enormous bonuses despite making decisions that cost the company billions; he oversaw a brain-drain of talent as people such as John Lasseter, Jeffrey Katzenberg and the Pixar group left the corporation because of their inability to work for Eisner; he would apppoint his friends to positions and then immediately fall out with them; the list goes on.It's a fascinating book, and it makes me view Disney in a whole new light. It's always been hard to look past the magic and see Disney as 'just another evil greedy corporation' but this book surely makes it easy to start."}, {"userName": "Shivasankari", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8944095-shivasankari", "userReview": "If you're a fan of business situation bio's, you'll enjoy this book. It's not of the same caliber of Stewart's previous work, but I thought it was one of the best books in this genre.That said, the book has serious flaws that keep it from being a great read. The endless bickering and backstabbing at Disney gets tedious and becomes a laundry list of conflicts.This book is the dramatic story of the reinventing years of the mid 1980's through the mid 2000's. It's focus is mainly on Michael Eisner, the CEO and boss during that period. We get a good look at what went on behind the scenes and in the boardroom during that time frame. As a child, I always watched Disney movies and productions without giving much though to all the hard work that went on in order to get these productions to the public. It's fascinating to see how Disney went from the king of animation to a struggling studio trying to keep up and then back again to the top of it's field. In this book we get a great inside look at the characters that worked tirelessly to maintain the legacy. Some personal stories had happy endings while many didn't.Nevertheless, I must say that this book was very exciting to read especially if you love thrilling boardroom drama filled with cut-throat politics.Read this if you want a sense of what occurred at Disney during the Eisner era. But, if you want to be entertained while reading a business book (after the first couple of hundred pages) this isn't the book. Would recommend if you're interested in learning about Disney, or would like to learn more about business, corporate governance, & executive compensation."}, {"userName": "Greg Brown", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2467638-greg-brown", "userReview": "A pretty fascinating recounting of the last two or three decades of Disney history, although it suffers somewhat from predating the Iger-era. I would have loved to hear about Pixar's acquisition, but what's in the book is more than enough drama.Eisner is pretty vividly portrayed as a guy who was a big shot of creativity and energy that the company needed at a crucial time, but who was best when kept in check and when a string of hits staved off the infighting that later consumed the company. From the mid-90s on, the company culture comes across as deeply perverse and it's amazing that it continued to survive as well as it did (largely thanks to the Pixar deal, the ascendancy of ESPN, and Bruckheimer's event-films).The sections of the book covering the early years were the most interesting to me, if only because it described the process by which some of the company's best work was done. Later on, the book shifts significantly toward corporate intrigue and chronicling how executive after executive fell victim to Eisner's paranoia (or worse, adopted it for themselves). Even Iger doesn't come off as spotless, though the whole thing has a similar premise to Mad Men: people trying to be good in a morally-perverse environment, and deciding which parts of their personal morality they can sacrifice to survive.The prose itself is workable, but the research is impressive and piecing it together into a coherent story must have been endless amounts of work.

Eisner was captivating to follow throughout his career.

It's one thing to work in the office making deals, planning strategy, and cutting costs; it's quite another to put on a Goofy suit and give a high-five to a 4-year-old who thinks you're the greatest thing that's ever happened to them. The unique nature of Disney products - the word \"magical\" gets thrown around a lot - means that the stakes around any business decision they make are about as high as it gets in the entertainment world. That's why it's so fascinating to read all the downright un-magical behind-the-scenes material about the tumultuous tenure of superstar CEO Michael Eisner that Stewart unearthed. Rarely will you get see so many men worth hundreds of millions of dollars, each dedicated to the careful curation of childhood, act so childishly themselves.I was born in 1984, the year that Eisner became CEO of Disney after stints as a highly successful executive at ABC and Paramount. It's a truism that most people consider the pop culture that was produced during their childhoods to be the best (see all of those obnoxious \"only 90s kids will get this!\" articles), but it's undeniable that when Eisner took over what was then a troubled enterprise, he started a golden age. Along with new President/COO Frank Wells and studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg (an incredibly smart guy who's cruelly referred to as Eisner's \"golden retriever\"), he oversaw a solid decade of immensely successful, distinctively creative, era-defining classics. The stretch of animated films from The Little Mermaid to The Lion King would be enough to endear Eisner to anyone, to say nothing of live-action films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit.But the first half of Eisner's reign at Disney saw immense profits on nearly all fronts and a newly aggressive wave of acquisitions. From animation to live action to television, from Miramax to ABC to Touchstone, Eisner not only rescued Disney from the threat of being bought out by another studio, he transformed it into the premiere studio that it remains to this day. Stewart doesn't use this term in the book, but the Disney Renaissance was one of the more dramatic turnarounds in entertainment history. Many studios have been founded, expanded, reached their apex, and then been acquired or have failed; that Disney didn't suffer that fate is a testament not only to Eisner's team, but his own instincts and judgment.The bulk of the book is not devoted to Eisner's triumphs, however, but to his travails, above all his difficulties with his executive team. A CEO on the scale that Eisner was - at one point he was by far the highest-paid chief in America - is almost guaranteed to have psychological issues with control, and Stewart's chronicle of Eisner's decision-making processes is as baffling as it is riveting. Eisner seemed to have an uncanny ability to alienate people, especially his closest friends such as Katzenberg, a true creative partner and perhaps more responsible for Disney's turnaround than anyone else, Eisner included. The sections where Eisner costs Disney millions upon millions of dollar in legal fees due to contract disputes with Katzenberg are eye-opening in how petty they are.But the list of people Eisner alienated doesn't end with Katzenberg, who masterminded many of the best of the Renaissance movies and brokered several of the key partnerships like Pixar before leaving to found Dreamworks after an acrimonious split. Eisner also managed to poison the well with Paramount producer Larry Gordon, who Eisner literally jumped in a lake to avoid after their falling-out; as well as best friend and super-agent Michael Ovitz, whose prodigious talents at dealmaking and client relationships were wasted in a brief and unhappy role as President of Disney after Wells' unfortunate death in a helicopter accident. All of these supremely bright and motivated talents saw themselves frustrated and eventually cut off as Eisner's increasingly imperious and arbitrary rule slowly started to choke off the sources of growth the Renaissance depended on. Fascinatingly, Eisner himself augured this turn of events in a phone call to Sid Bass, Disney's largest shareholder, before he even became CEO: \"Companies like Disney are always founded by creative entrepreneurs but eventually the founder dies or gets pushed out, or moves on to something else. Inevitably the business people take over - the managers - and they focus on preserving the vision that made the company great in the first place. They don't have any creative ideas themselves and they end up surrounding themselves instead with analysts and accountants to try to control the creative people and cut costs. In the process, they discourage change and new initiatives and reinvention. In time, the company begins to ossify and atrophy and die.\" Eisner's leadership was at its best when he surrounded himself with driven, creative people and allowed them the freedom to run their own parts of the company, and when he allowed others to give him advice.Unfortunately, the skills to transform a moribund studio into a powerhouse are not necessarily the same as it takes to maintain a powerhouse, and so Eisner eventually began to stumble, such as pushing forward with the incredibly expensive Euro Disney project, and continuing with his increasingly damaging streak of alienating talented executives who disagreed with his decisions. Along the way, Stewart uncovers a lot of interesting business decisions that offer plenty to ponder: the shift from consistent but smaller movies (\"singles and doubles\", in Eisner's term) to the very star-laden blockbuster system he had initially disdained; the questionable management of relationships between different parts of a studio (ABC in particular); the inability to know when to demand creative control over every facet of a project and when to delegate; failure to properly structure the relationship between board of directors and the management team (Disney had one of the most lickspittle boards imaginable); appalling pay structures for executives and artists; and perhaps most interestingly, poor decisions about the production, marketing, and distribution of content. Check out a partial list of properties Disney either ignored or missed profiting on:- The Sixth Sense- CSI- Survivor- The Lord of the Rings- The ApprenticeThat's billions of dollars, right there.Disney is a protean company, as evidenced by its latest resurgence. This book was published in 2005, so many of its loose ends have been resolved by history. Robert Iger is now CEO and has evidently learned much from his somewhat neutered position under Eisner. The \"Snow Queen\" movie that looked to have a troubled development cycle was eventually released as Frozen, to universal acclaim and dump trucks full of money. Even that looming threat of the Comcast buyout has nearly vanished from memory. The Pixar relationship was mended happily by a merger, to be followed by acquisitions of Marvel and Lucasfilm, which ensures that Disney will maintain its near-monopoly on the notion of childhood for decades to come. One acquisition that could have stood some more investigation was that of ABC, whose ESPN subsidiary becomes more profitable by the minute. Eisner might not be around to enjoy it, but even if his poor decisions once threatened one of the most legendary companies in American culture, it still wouldn't be around today without him."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28478055-joe", "userReview": "This was a very fascinating account of events I was not even aware of. I recently spent several months working a contract position at Disney in Glendale and, just across the street from one of the buildings we worked in was Dreamworks Animation. At the time, I didn't realize why there was such an air of distrust and antipathy towards that other building and its occupants, but after reading Disney War, I get it.There was so much that I didn't know about Disney's transformation from the company it was in the late 1970's to what it is now. To be honest, I don't know what to believe. On the one hand, I have great nostalgia for the cartoons I enjoyed in my youth; among them were The Fox and the Hound, The Sword in the Stone, and Pete's Dragon. On the other hand, the heavy productization and commercialization of all IP kind-of makes me sick to my stomach, and Disney embodies these ideas more than any other company I can think of.This book shed a lot of light on how the transformation from creative haven to media powerhouse took place at Disney. Stewart took great care to present first-hand accounts from the people living out the real-life melodrama, and provided a nuanced picture of the conflicts that forced Disney to both grow-up, in the sense of managing it's business interests more carefully, and stay true to its roots, in the sense of ensuring creative culture within the organization was given room to fluorish.This book was truly a pleasure to read. It had a slew of interesting characters who, at times, went from being active collaborators to hostile enemies. The twists and turns of the real story are quite worthy of Disney's representation for telling fictional stories :)"}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5883445-jonathan", "userReview": "A dramatic telling of Michael Eisner's tenure as Disney's Chairman & CEO, 1984 - 2005. If you've grown up seeing Mr. Eisner as host of ABC's \"Wonderful World of Disney,\" you'll see another side of the man through this book.There is no doubt that Eisner's contribution not only saved Disney from ending but also positioned the company to become the mega-conglomerate it is today. Throughout the book, there are stories of his grasp of power and intuitive decisionmaking that are both impressive and surprising. Combined with a distrust of most people and utter self-confidence, Eisner created culture shock throughout the Disney company.The weakest sections include dramatized conversations had between high-level executives. The sources of these discussions often come from anyone but Eisner, and there is little insight as to what was going through his head at these moments. Although he masterminded many grabs for power, we never truly understand his motivations, only his actions. The rest of the Disney employees are portrayed as obedient and highly tolerant subjects in Eisner's kingdom... until internal conflict led to the campaign that ultimately ousted him.This is a must-read for any Disney fan, but be prepared to step away from the \"Uncle Walt\" persona the company often tells. Eisner was a prickly personality that got away with a lot of negative behavior because of his success. If you think Disney is just about cartoons, princesses, and theme parks, then you'll need to read this book."}, {"userName": "Aydin Turgay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27142577-aydin-turgay", "userReview": "DisneyWar is a book that I had procrastinated reading for quite a while.I think I was daunted by both the book's length and its \"business profile\" subject matter.But I'm really glad I gave it a chance, because I ended up LOVING it!After having read many Disney-related books (such as Bob Thomas's incredible Walt Disney biography, Imagineer Marty Sklar's wonderful Dream It Do It, the leadership-heavy The Wisdom of Walt by Jeff Barnes and several Jim Korkis books), I was looking to learn more about the company AFTER Walt. I felt like I needed to bridge my Disney knowledge between Walt's death and the present day.Mostly, DisneyWar is the story of Michael Eisner's tumultuous time as Disney President & CEO. Like many Disney Parks fans, I have a lot of affection for Eisner's era, which included tons of investment in the parks and resorts, as well as the rejuvenation of the feature animation department.It was so interesting to learn about this era, and why Eisner was so respected at first, then disliked towards the end of his tenure.I loved learning about Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney and his son-in-law Ron Miller.I gained a better understanding of Disney's current CEO Bob Iger's history with the company.And I now tell you tons of interesting stuff about Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Ovitz.These names were all very familiar to me before reading DisneyWar, and I now understand their roles and history within the company.Although DisneyWar is non-fiction, it reads with the pace of a modern, well-written novel. I never felt like it lagged or got bogged down by dates, statistics or details.Because of its length, I found it easier to enjoy DisneyWar while reading a novel at the same time. I would alternate books between chapters, as I often do while enjoying a longer non-fiction read.If you're a fan of Disney Parks or the Walt Disney Company, or just the animation/film industry in general, I highly recommend DisneyWar."}], "description": "\"When You Wish Upon a Star,\" \"Whistle While You Work,\" \"The Happiest Place on Earth\"\u2014these are lyrics indelibly linked to Disney, one of the most admired and best-known companies in the world.
