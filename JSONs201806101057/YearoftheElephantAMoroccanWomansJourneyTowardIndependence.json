A woman moves from marriage through a painful loss of place when her husband tells her their marriage is over and she will receive \"whatever the law provides\". It is also the chronicle of the Moroccan move toward independence and her part in the resistance. And the seeming disconnect between these two women. \"'Whatever the law provide!'And what is that? Expenses for a hundred days? that shows the extent of the law's regard for women. throw them out on the streets with a hundred days of expenses.\"The story is beautifully written, full of details of Moroccan life of the time, life in the country and city, the difficulties of life as a woman alone. \"The golden leaves which bestow the enchantment of autumn on our region have fallen, and the trees stand naked under lashes of winter winds and rains. Soon snow will fall and the trees will assume strange shapes in the white vastness like works of modern sculpture.In light of what is happening through the Arab world, I find the following very important: \"In the beginning of the Resistance, we believed the  struggle would wash away all spite and malice, just as we thought that Independence would relieve our cares and heal our sores like miracle cures sold in the  market. In fact, we loaded Independence down with a  burden it could not bear....\"The remaining stories are short vignettes of Moroccan life, not as intense as the titled novella, but expressing different parts of life and some seem to have a touch of fable.A very strong collection and I will look for more from this author."}, {"userName": "Farah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL":

What the reader comes to find is that women fought in the struggle as much as the men.

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7556712-melanie", "userReview": "Leila Abouzeid's novella, \u2018\u0100m al-f\u012bl / Year of the Elephant focuses on a pivotal historical moment in Moroccan social memory: the transition from colonial rule to national independence. Her personal experience of this tumultuous period entwines the challenges of post-colonial Morocco with the challenges of post-married life. Prior to national and personal independence, purpose and conviction drove Abouzeid to carry out dangerous missions as a member of the Resistance. When the Resistance finally achieved its aim of Independence, Abouzeid's husband and fellow freedom fighter received an appointment to political office. Abouzeid, in contrast, received notification of divorce and a paltry financial compensation that only served to humiliate her. I understand Abouzeid's narrative as a social commentary from the perspective of all Moroccans who risked their lives for national independence, only to find disappointment following the success of that endeavor. People attributed benevolence, generosity, and wisdom to the Sultan, but Abouzeid finds that poverty and injustic remain even after the Sultan returns to his throne. One key aspect of this injustic in her narrative is her position as a woman dependent on a man who treats her as less than an equal. The institutions support his actions, leaving Abouzeid scarred and disappointed in the behavior of all the authority figures in her life. She finds peace and reassurance by resorting to Diving authority and to the hope in ultimate justice. The poor, wise sheikh of her village and his simple life inspire her to hold to her ideads and ethics. Thus her answer to those disappointed in authorities, especially to women, is to ground themselves in the deepest roots of their identities to find strength, purpose, and inspiration."}, {"userName": "Michael Vicente Perez", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/604236-michael-vicente-perez", "userReview": "I used this course in an introductory anthropology course and the students seemed to enjoy it. It is very well written (translated, is the more appropriate term). My students didn't have a difficult time with the text even though they did not know much about Moroccan history. Personally, I think the text is excellent. It's sophisticated yet simple and it offers an enjoyable yet gripping story. I will use the text again and am happy to read it one, two, or even three more times."}, {"userName": "Marieke", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke", "userReview": "I need to reread this.

Although Morocco was granted independence in 1956 without the protracted war and bloodshed that Algeria underwent in 1957-62 to shake off French rule, independence for this small Atlantic-Mediterreanean country was still a long and painful process. Leila Abouzeid was born in 1960, a product of independent Morocco, and became a respected journalist and TV anchorwoman in her country. However, she begins her story in 1952 during the Casablanca massacre when hundreds of protesting Moroccans were shot by French police. Her title comes from an important battle in early Islam when foreign tribes riding elephants marched on the sanctuary of Mecca. Barbara Hallow, author of the book's preface, states, \" The battle of the Year of the Elephant (in about 570 A.D.) was won by the support of small and unimportant elements: flocks of bird that miraculously appeared and so bombareded the elephants with clay pellets and rocks that the mighty animals were forced to turn back in defeat\" (xxv). The political events of 1956 form a backdrop to the story of Zahra, who has just been divorced by her husband of 40 years for being too traditional and out of step with modern life. \"I don't eat with a fork. I don't speak French. I don't sit with men. I don't go out to fancy dinners\" (10). Once, rich and pampered by her husband, Zahra describes how he announced to her their divorce. \"He had simply sat down and said, 'Your papers will be sent to you along with whatever the law provides.' My papers? How worthless a woman is if she can be returned with a paper receipt like some store-bought object! How utterly worthless!\" (1) She continues, \"For our people, divorce is a catastrophe, an absolute disaster. Any objection [a wife] might raise is shattered with one decisive blow. There is nothing more to add\" (8). Fortunately, Zahra does have some property--a small room in her native town that was left to her by her father. This is where she makes her new, lonely home, as she looks backward on the events of and her role in Moroccan independence. She refuses to live with her married sister and be supported by her brother-in-law, thus angering and alienating her only family members. Zarha gets a job and resigns herself to her fate--poverty and loneliness. The short stories that follow in this volume are not much more upbeat, and most deal with the plight of the divorced woman and the cultural concept of how quickly and whimsically a husband may decide to divorce his wife--with immediate and sorrowful results for her."}, {"userName": "Si Med", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19650355-si-med",

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31109339-courtney-muhammad", "userReview": "In the preface to Leila Abouzeid\u2019s Year of the Elephant, writer and filmmaker Elizabeth Fernea details the unique struggle Morocco faced in repelling their French colonial occupiers. This background in the development of Moroccan nationalism, Fernea stresses, is important for a Western audience in reading this novel. Abouzeid focuses her work on the final stages of this repulsion of the French, particularly one woman\u2019s narrative of her part in the struggle and what her life eventually becomes after her brave dedication to the cause.By focusing the story on a woman more ordinary than extraordinary, she may be crediting the everyday people of Morocco for achieving their independence. Indeed, she dedicates her book to the women and men that risked their lives for Morocco; however, she also mentions that they expected no gratitude or compensation for their sacrifice. This very real address to the people of Morocco also becomes a theme in the book. The main character, Zahra, is left not only without gratitude, but also without means for a living, as she is divorced by her husband. Repeated throughout the text is the sentence: \u201cYour papers will be sent to you along with whatever the law provides.\u201d Discarded by her husband, she returns to her home town now void of family members and friends. She is, in essence, returned merchandise, left without recourse. Zahra has fought for independence from colonial rule and now must fight for independence and survival in her own community. Zahra asks: \u201cI, too, entered the struggle and carried out missions for my homeland. But now what does my homeland do for me\u201d (24). Zahra desperately seeks a way to exist in a space where she no longer has a defined role. She is no longer a resistance fighter and she is no longer a wife. Her story before the divorce is revealed in increments and the reader glimpses into her life before she was divorced and discovers how she became involved in the fight for Moroccan independence.Though she is now left with nothing, Zahra does not display remorse nor does she wish to change the deeds she performed. Instead, she grapples with her new life by doing anything she can, even trying her hand at spinning wool. She finds comfort and even solace with a sheik that guides Zahra. It is her religion, as a Muslim Moroccan woman, that gives her the fortitude to forge her way as a woman in post-colonial Morocco. In Islam she finds liberation. Many critics offer this as an example of a feminism that challenges the Western construction of feminism as being in direct conflict with the Muslim faith. The title of the work itself is an allusion to the holy year in Islam when a battle was won against elephants by a flock of birds that bombarded an army of elephants with stones from the sky. It is with this religious allusion that Abouzeid demonstrates the immense power of the perceived meek.Zahra wrote this book in Arabic and presumably did not intend a Western audience. Her words written in her language, in a way, celebrate the trials that so many ordinary Moroccans underwent in order to achieve independence. Also, focusing on the outcome of a neglected heroine, Abouzeid explores the way her community has struggled with identity in the aftermath of French crimes and abuse. This is the first work by a contemporary Arab women writer to be translated into English. This gives the Western reader the privilege to share Zahra\u2019s journey, and to see a different portrayal of Islam as a source of women\u2019s empowerment in a Western realm that is too often dominated by only negative renderings of the religion."}, {"userName": "Farhan Khalid", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2881911-farhan-khalid",

the world. Luckily, she is smart and resourceful. This novella takes up most of the book (pp. 1\u201370) and is followed by several very short stories, which are more like vignettes, really. All serve to convey a tone and atmosphere of a foreign place, which is the author's home. I felt detached from the stories and the characters, although they all held my interest very well. They seem realistic enough but one step removed, as if we are watching them from behind a screen. I only skimmed over the introduction, which was written by Elizabeth Fernea, the author of A Street in Marrakech (my review), which I loved."}, {"userName": "Salma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15643912-salma", "userReview": "An amazing novella by Leila Abouzeid!She masterfully exposed the harsh reality and bitter betrayal women faced after independence from colonialism. The country and the society pushed them back into the shadows. This happened in all African and Arab countries after their independence - when true nationalism was thrown out the window, and men assumed all leadership roles at the expense of women. Nationalism does not simply require the freedom of a nation's men, but women as well. A country cannot truly be free without the freedom and equality for all, which is something people still do not seem to comprehend. Let's hope this recurring injustice does not carry on too long in the world."}, {"userName": "Sunny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny", "userReview": "Maybe this would have had more of an impact on me if I could have read it in its native Arab language. I taught English in Rabat for 2 weeks in the early 2000s which is where a lot of the novel is set but I still found this a little hard to engage with. The story is about a young woman who gains independence juxtaposed against the events of her own country (Morocco) gaining independence at the same time. The match-off of the macro and her personal micro is not an unusual theme. Faulks does it well in Birdsong going from graphic war scenes to graphic love scenes. I can\u2019t think of much else to say about this novel however as it didn\u2019t have all that much of an impact on me."}, {"userName": "Eduardo C\u00e1rdenas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51446660-eduardo-c-rdenas", "userReview": "The author has potential and it's an interesting piece of post-colonialism.
