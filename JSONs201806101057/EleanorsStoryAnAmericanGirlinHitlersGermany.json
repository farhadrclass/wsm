The play itself was an emotional roller coaster and when i discovered that it was based on a book i just had to get my grubby hands on it. The story goes of a young American born girl to German immigrant parents who after struggling financially during the Great Depression, make the fateful decision in 1939 to leave there family home in Stratford, New Jersey and move to Germany were Eleanor's father is offered a lucrative job. With a highly generous exchange rate the parents will ignore the impending situation with Hitler and Germany in Europe.On the ship travelling to a new life the families mood will change as first it is announced that Germany has invaded Poland and then even more horribly Britain and France have declared war against Germany. On there arrival after being denied a return to America, living in Berlin, life seems for a while at least to be normal. Eleanor and her older brother Frank will go to school and make friends and spend time with family and with there father working life is good. That will soon change as the war progresses with less and food, the horror of constant bombing raids that would kill numerous people and destroy many buildings, Elanor's mother giving birth to two children, Tommy and Elizabeth that would push the family to breaking point and constant separations in a bid to survive.When the war ends and with the country in ruins a new terror will show itself in the Russians who made it to Berlin first and want Germany to suffer for there leading role in the war. Many young girls and women would be raped, while anyone thought to be a member of the German war effort would face severe punishment. In the end Eleanor and her family would be lucky as they are located in the American sector of the Berlin and there American passports would save them from execution and Eleanor and her mother from being raped at the hands of the Russians. In 1946, Elanor, Frank and her father would finally return to America with her mother, Tommy and Elizabeth joining them less than a year later.This book for me was a true eye opener. Plenty of books have been wrote about the second world war, but being read through the eyes of civilians it offers a different perspective and is compelling and harrowing. The hell of being in a country being blown into oblivion is very sobering. What these generations of people went through during the two world wars was mind blowing and how they survived and was able to move on with there lives is just amazing. For Eleanor and her family the horror of knowing that you are stuck in a foreign country while the land you loves wants to kill you would of been terrifying. The writing itself is a little uneven with a slow and pedantic first third that is soon forgotten as the war hits with a vengeance. Showcasing the power of the human spirit, Eleanor's Story is a fascinating read."}, {"userName": "Ria Giegel", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5593114-ria-giegel", "userReview": "This book brought back the horrors of the war to me. I too was an American child born in Germany with a slightly different twist. my father was an American seaman who married a German girl, and my birth at the end og August 1939' changed their plans forever. My mother and I had to remain in Germany thru the war years. We lived in Hamburg which was also horribly bombed in 1943. Eleanors details of the bombing brought back memories of waking up nightly and running for the bunkers or the cellar, not seeing daylight for days. Even though I saw death I was too young to understand it. We were also evacuated out of the city, where we were overtaken by the Russian Army. it was exactly as she described, plundering and rapes, and we hid in a storage closet in the attic. In 1947 my father was finally able to get us passage out of Germany, and we also went the same way as Eleanor! Berlin to Bremerhaven and waiting in a barracks for our turn on the ship. Except for our age difference we had similar experiences. I gave it 5stars."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3966140-barbara", "userReview": "Great book! I highly recommend it.

Then you'll love this memoir from a girl who actually experienced that dark time My book for this trimester was \u2018Eleanor's Story: An American Girl in Hitler's Germany\u2019 which is about a girl, Eleanor whos family moves from America to their native country Germany because her father was offered a good job opportunity. But as Eleanor and her family are on their way to germany by crossing the atlantic war breaks out and they become trapped in Germany for the duration of the war. Written in a diary, she explains how she struggles to keep her American identity around the German nationalist ideology surrounding her. Throughout the book she expresses her hopes for an Allied victory (United States Of America, British Empire, France, Soviet Union, etc) yet trying for years to survive Allied bombs shattering her neighborhood in Germany. She also talks about threats of separation her and her family faced from the Gestapo, starvation, bombings, the terrors of soviet occupancy, and the final fierce battle for Berlin. At the end her family is finally able to return to the United States in 1946 when Eleanor is 16.I personally love this book, I\u2019m really interested about WWII and love learning about it in history class and even outside of class so I would definitely recommend this book for a history lover. I also love how the book was written and how the writer really emotionally connects with the reader by explaining her earlier years in America with the contrast of earlier years in Germany separated away from her parents, I feel as if this already sets the scene or displays her being torn between both countries and her trying to keep her American identity in Germany. This book is also a memoir, which I love because it shows the authors fears, childhood conflicts, triumphs, and losses over time during such a tragic part in her life. One of my interest in the book were her exchanges with her harsh and sometimes cruel father. The characters in the book are her father, mother, and her brother Frank and at times i feel as if i can relate (not totally relate because my father isn't under the stress of nazis) of having a father who is trying his best for their family but at times comes off cruel.in conclusion, i love this book and how much it emotionally connects with the reader with such tragic stories and identity issues during a time of life where identity is so important."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7897100-katherine", "userReview": "Eleanor\u2019s Story is the autobiographical tale of a young American girl who lived in Germany during the blackest part of Hitler\u2019s reign and for the duration of World War II. Garner begins her memoir by telling the reader the reason she decided to record and share her experiences with the world:\u201cStatistics are numbers, but numbers represent individual lives, people who lived and breathed, who laughed and cried, who loved and suffered. Each one of the millions who died and every person who miraculously survived had a story. Mine is only one of them. This war lives on in infamy. It must never be forgotten, lest we forget our humanity\u201d (x).The book begins at Garner\u2019s childhood home in Stratford, New Jersey in 1938. Garner, who was eight at the time, is the child of immigrant parents from Germany. The family was in a precarious financial situation following the Depression and considered moving back to Germany. Although the situation in Germany was a bit unstable at the time, the family did not believe it was serious enough to turn down a lucrative job offer. On the ship during the departing journey, the captain announces that Germany has invaded Poland. Shortly thereafter, he announces that Britain and France have declared war against Germany, and the Ramrath family knows that they are in trouble. Luckily, the ship arrives safely. But when the family immediately tries to return to the United States, they are distressed to discover that they will not be allowed to do so. They realize they will be stuck in Germany for the duration of the war.Life does not begin too poorly for the family, with Eleanor and her brother making fast friends with their peers, and enjoying the sights and scenery in Berlin. Eleanor has a difficult time adjusting to German schooling, and must quickly learn to read and write in German. She and her brother also suffer a sometimes strained relationship with her parents. Strict guidelines are placed on the children\u2019s behavior, and punishments are often severe. In this manner, the book also explores some of the more normal aspects of growing up, becoming a teenager, and dealing with family problems. As the war progresses, the reader sees how normal, everyday life in Berlin is drastically changed. Bombings and air raids become frequent, and the family must make a nightly trek to the cellar to ensure their safety. One of the book\u2019s most chilling moments occurs when the apartment building next door is reduced to a pile of rubble. For days afterwards, Eleanor must deal with listening to the nightmarish knocking she hears from people trapped underneath the debris. When Germany really begins to feel the effect of the war, the family must survive multiple separations, relocations, and the birth of two more children. Eleanor is caught between the two countries \u2013 she and her family secretly support the Allies but must deal with being under attack from the very countries they support. The following passage deftly illustrates her predicament:\u201cAmerica\u2019s involvement with the war sent me into a tailspin. How bizarre! I thought. The soldiers of the country where I was born, the country I love, will be told to kill me, my family, and my new friends. And the soldiers of the country of my ancestry, of my beloved Omis, the country where I live, will be told to hate and kill Americans. Where do I stand in all of this? Who should I be loyal to?\u201d (68).The family is greatly relieved when the war is finally over, but then must deal with the post-war Russian occupation, and the constant danger of potential rapes, robberies, and beatings. Finally, in 1946, the family is allowed to return to the United States and their nightmare is over, though the psychological after effects never fully dissipate. Booklist calls Eleanor\u2019s Story a \u201cpowerful coming-of-age tale\u2026told with intensity and also the freshness of teenage years remembered: there are repeated brutal bombings and countless brushes with death; there are also friends, holiday celebrations, and two babies born to the family during the war, who engage Eleanor\u2019s love and protection\u2026It all coalesces into a must-have memoir about an aspect of wartime survival not often written about in children\u2019s literature\u201d (Amazon.com 2004). Garner\u2019s writing style is fresh, simple, and straightforward. She does not shy away from describing difficult and embarrassing moments from her teen years, thereby solidifying the human aspect of her story. The people that populate the pages of the book are varied and diverse, but as in many memoirs, some are more memorable than others. The most interesting aspect of the book is the description of daily life during the war, which not only enlightens the reader about German history, culture, and heritage, but also shows real people dealing with the horrors of war with bravery, resilience, and dignity. A number of gruesome incidents illustrate the horrific nature of war and hit the reader with a heavy impact. Still, Garner is never excessively explicit in her descriptions, allowing a sense of horror to come from the reality of the actions and events themselves rather than her description of them. In addition, the book includes maps, photographs of important people and places, and poems \u2013 some written by herself while in Germany, others from the likes of such writers as Emily Dickinson and Sylvia Plath. A number of letters written back and forth from Eleanor to her family and friends are also included, giving insight into the feelings and thoughts of some of the key figures in the book. These extras provide the reader with a more rounded reading experience and add artistic depth to the account.This book is highly recommended for teenagers and children who are mature enough to handle reading about the more difficult aspects of war."}, {"userName": "Holli", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754922-holli", "userReview": "Wow.

Eleanor Ramrath Garner's memoir, Eleanor's Story: An American Girl in Hitler's Germany (Peachtree, 1999), is just as incredible. This memoir tells the story of nine-year-old Eleanor, an American girl of German immigrant parents. Unable to find work during the Depression, Eleanor's electrical engineer father is finally offered a good position working for a German company. Decent pay, a chance to return and visit family. Eleanor's parents decide to take the job--just for two years, they tell her.On August 29, 1939 Eleanor's family--her mother, father, and older brother Frank--board the SS Hamburg, a German luxury liner, and head to Berlin. On September 1, the captain announces that Germany has declared war on Poland. Two days later he reports that France and Britain have declared war on Germany. The nightmare known as World War II has officially begun and Eleanor's family is heading straight into its center.During the Atlantic crossing, the ship stops so the crew can paint over the ship's German flag, first to French then Norwegian colors. Eleanor's family makes it across the Atlantic without being torpedoed but is trapped in Germany. Return passage is available only for those with US dollars-Eleanor's father has already traded their dollars for marks. Another chance to return fails because Eleanor's mother lacks US citizenship. The rest of the family could leave but that would mean abandoning their mother. Eleanor's family is trapped in Germany for the entire war.Eleanor's Story offers a different perspective on World War II, a sort of flip side to Anne Frank. The dichotomy of being both German and American conflicts Eleanor. As the US enters the war, she thinks, \"The soldiers of the country where I was born, the country I love, will be told to kill me, my family, and my new friends. And the soldiers of the country of my ancestry, of my beloved Omis [grandparents], the country where I live, will be told to hate and kill Americans. Where do I stand in all of this? Who should I be loyal to? (p. 68). Ironically this dual status also protects her family. Her father and brother are not drafted into the German Army. As Berlin falls to the Russians, American passports save Eleanor's family from execution and save her and her mother from rape. When US soldiers enter Berlin, Eleanor's father gets a job as a translator for a colonel in the American Command Post and these connections ultimately help the family return to the States. Be aware, this is a pretty adult children's book. Although Eleanor's Story has won several children's book awards, you should read it yourself before handing it to your precocious second grader that just finished Twilight. The book is explicit. Face it, you really can't write about the horrors of war and leave out all the horror. Death and violence surround Eleanor--a soldier who beheads himself on the train tracks rather than get sent to the front, bodies stacked in piles in cellars because there is no time to bury them during bombings, a girlfriend shot randomly by Russian occupation soldiers. Eleanor waits in terror during bombings: Lights in the cellar suddenly flickered, followed by a piercing whistle and a deafening blast. I placed my forehead on my knees and wrapped my arms around my legs. Screaming bombs and explosions erupted all around us. The whole foundation of the building shook. Plaster rained from the ceiling, enveloping us in ghostly white. The pole in the center of the room shook. It had just been pushed under the ceiling and wasn't attached to anything. Please, please, I begged the Invisibles, [the angels to whom she prays], let it hold up the ceiling (p.106).Through it all, Eleanor's mother remains the stable force that holds the family together. Mother insists they sweep and clean after each bombing. She makes them bathe and use a tablecloth, and it is precisely these small, mundane routines that anchor the family through the terror, chaos, and uncertainty of war. Little things comfort Eleanor tremendously: a small Boticelli Madonna that hangs above her bed, images of her peaceful home in Philadelphia that she replays one by one in her mind during bombings so she doesn't go crazy. As a teenager, I vividly remember aching over my inability to have the fancy house, designer clothes, and cool vacations that it seemed like everyone else got. Eleanor's Story is important for its history, but it will also give your teen (and you) some perspective. There are a lot worse things in life than being the only one at school who doesn't have a real Coach purse, Ugg boots, and a car. Many people long simply for a safe home and enough to eat. Eleanor's Story also offers compelling proof of the strength of the human spirit. People are able to endure unbelievable pain and survive. It made me reconsider my own challenges, trivial by comparison. Eleanor's Story's offers readers both the worst and best of what it means to be human."}, {"userName": "Ruth Coleman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14913200-ruth-coleman", "userReview": "This book is an extremely interesting first-hand account of the fall of Berlin at the end of WWII.

I am amazed that her entire family made it through the war intact, especially since there were so many close calls with her brother and her father. Parts were hard to read, but important that we don't forget what happened during this terrible time. I was also amazed that she was spared the cruelty of the Russian soldiers when so many were not. I knew that the Russians weren't very nice when they took over, but I never realized how nasty and brutal they were. I hadn't thought much about the hardships and the starvation of the German people(even though she was American) during the war years and after. They had to be so careful if they didn't agree with Hitler and what he was doing and so many people didn't even know what was really going on(I'm thinking of the prisoner she saw through the fence). I was glad to read how the family did after coming to the States(and interesting to hear of her experiences in high school). I thought it was very fitting that she married an American soldier.

He accepted a 2 year commitment to a German engineering company. Her parents had immigrated to the US in the 20s and were hit by the Depression badly. In 1932 her mother returned with the children to Germany and left her and her brother with their grandparents, one to each set for 2 years. They returned, at 4 and 6, in the care of a cabin steward. Now in 39 the family sought economic security, despite the foreboding of friends. They had second thoughts when Germany invaded Poland and war was declared by England and France during the crossing but since return passage could only be paid for in US dollars and they had converted their money to marks they were stuck. Determined to make the best of things they took the job in Berlin and tried to adjust. The family is fairly lucky during the early years; working, schooling, making friends and visiting their extended families. They live in a suburb of Berlin, but as rationing increases the children get sent for extensive periods to relatives in the country. After 2 years when they apply to return to the US they find that Father and the children can go but not the Mother who never got her US citizenship while in the US and she is pregnant. The Father has a few run ins with the Gestapo for unrestrained comments, but again they are lucky. American citizenship saves them at other points. A second child is born. As bombing increases the family is again split and all but Father moves out of Berlin. When Russian advances threaten they return to Berlin. In 46 the Father and 2 older children return to the US and spend a year getting funds to bring the Mother and younger children to the US. The story tells of hardship, death, horrifying experiences and a lot of luck. But for a few incidents involving Jews and prisoners of war they seem to have little understanding of that underlying agenda. Despite being involved in the Hitler Youth and moving from place to place by train they seemed oblivious and were shocked when the camps were revealed. It was interesting to see how a family could live day to day facing immediate hardships and not be aware of the big picture, just keep your head down! The story was well told and written after Eleanor has retired. She changed some names and makes an attempt to tell what happened to many of the people mentioned. I liked that it gave her true understanding of things at the time and didn't superimpose ideas, foreshadow events, or try to justify incidents.

It was very moving, and I knew that I would have to read the book. The book is equally moving, if not more so, as it can go into so much more detail than the one hour play. In 1939, Eleanor Ramrath Garner's German born parents decided to move their family back to Germany to escape the hardships of the Great Depression in America. Her father had been offered a lucrative new job in Germany, one that allowed him to use his education as an engineer. The family dismissed the signs of the worsening political situation in Europe, and set out for Germany in the late summer. While en route, war broke out, and upon arrival in Germany they found they could not return to the United States. Eleanor tells the story of her family's early war experiences through the filter of a child's innocence, as she was only nine when the family arrived in Germany. At times we have to read between the lines to see what her parents were likely thinking and feeling. Her voice matures quickly, both due to age and the hardships and horrors she experiences. The family's experience as foreigners in Berlin is a somewhat unusual one, and is a perspective on the war that I had not heard before. While this book is classified as a children's or young adult book, I would be hesitant to recommend it for pre-teens or even junior high students. Some of the experiences the author describes are quite disturbing. It is, however, an excellent illustration of the way war changes a person, and of the resilience of the human spirit, and I feel it is a book that should get more recognition. Perhaps the success of the play will change that."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1740420-christina", "userReview": "A unique memoir, Eleanor\u2019s Story tells the story of, well, Eleanor, an American citizen who moves to Germany in 1939 at the age of nine. While on the ship bound for Germany, Hitler declares war and the family is unable to return. Therefore, Eleanor lives in Hitler\u2019s Germany until the end of the war when she moves back to the United States in 1946. In her memoir, Garner recounts life in Germany from ration cards to bombings by the Tommies, or Brits, to the pillage of Berlin by the Russians. While not superbly written, there are so many fascinating details included in Eleanor\u2019s Story that the writing is easily overlooked, and I think some of the more cumbersome details about wanting to have a beautiful dress or the secrets she and her friends share really work with the targeted age group from this book.There are so many books out there about being a prisoner or Holocaust victim in Nazi Germany, but Eleanor\u2019s Story covers what an every day German family -- Eleanor\u2019s parents and younger siblings are Germans -- went through during the war. Garner explains how Germans were kept from knowing what was actually going on, how Germans brought in workers from conquered lands like it was no big deal, how Germans could choose to remain ignorant about what they did know. Eleanor\u2019s Story pulls the reader in, making you feel what she's experiencing.

Hitler attacked Poland while they were on the boat to Germany. She tells of what it was like trying to fit in and learn the language and adapt to the fiercely patriotic culture and get along with her relatives in Germany. The tone in the first part of the book captures the child's carefree spirit rather well and what it must have felt like to be the author. However, as the war progresses she shares several disturbing experiences that would make this a poor selection for young audiences. It was very interesting reading about their experience with going through bombing air raids and the devastation they caused. Some of her experiences haunted her for many years (probably the rest of her life) and will haunt you a little too. This book is a vauluable story of civilian life in Germany during WWII and some of the aftermath. She discusses their experiences with racism and the fear people lived in from the secret police.

While they were on the boat over, war was declared. They couldn't go back home because ships would only take dollars and her father had already exchanged them for marks. They were stuck in Germany for the entirety of the war.Can you imagine being in a foreign country while your own home country bombed you? Her family were not Nazi supporters, were still American loyal, which they had to hide. 9 year old Eleanor was in the BDM and 10 year old Frank briefly in the HY - they were exempt, being Americans, but all the fun events happened for those groups. They were only allowed to attend social events, never anything political. It was a fine line, though, trying to fit in as German, but still using their American citizenship whenever it would benefit them.

I must say her father was a lousy decision maker all around; it's no wonder that her mother seems to be perpetually frustrated (plus giving birth to two more children in Germany!) The family goes through some horrendous times as the war progresses, but manages to stay together most of the time. It is written more as a juvenile/young adult book, but it reads perfectly well for adults as well. There are two sections of photographs that help make many of the people in the story come alive. It was interesting that she follows the German line of knowing nothing of the death camps until after the war was over. Of course they were so busy trying to stay alive themselves that the outer world had little impact; also after a while there was no electricity so they didn't even hear radio broadcasts.

Even though they are American citizens (except for her mom), they are unable to leave Germany because when they arrived, they exchanged all of their money to Deutschmarks and can't get it changed back. Eleanor is sent away from Berlin at one point to live in the country and keep safe, but she eventually comes back to her family in Berlin where they experience bombings, starvation, and the eventual occupation of the Russians (who aren't very nice, to put it lightly). Never Nazi supporters (flying the American flag on Hitler's birthday among a whole bunch of swastikas wasn't fabulous for them), Eleanor and her family also never knew the truth about the concentration camps until well after the war. Very interesting perspective. Writing style is okay, nothing special. This gets three stars because it took me a while to read which means I probably wasn't super captivated with the story."}, {"userName": "Loretta", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4031565-loretta", "userReview": "This was very interesting. Eleanor was an American girl whose family decided to go to live in Germany where her father had a good job offered him. Unfortunately, Hilter started invading countries as the family was traveling over to Germany. It was interesting to read about what happened in Germany from an American's viewpoint. The devastation, the bombing, the fight for survival. The fact that the people in Germany didn't really know about what was happening to the Jews and Gypsies and whomever else Hilter didn't like.Two quotes I liked were about books...what a surprise!Poetry opened up a new door of expression for me.Books gained such a hold over my imagination that I got lost in them. To me they were no longer fiction, but reality. I became the characters I read about. I was another person far away in another land, another life. I came back into the real world only when the book was abruptly slammed shut and I felt a stinging blow on my cheek."}, {"userName": "Xitlalli Cabrera", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59208542-xitlalli-cabrera", "userReview": "Eleanor\u2019s Story: An American Girl in Hitler\u2019s Germany was pretty good. The book was about a girl who moved to Germany for her dad\u2019s job and was said to return about 2 years later. On the ship ride to Germany, they were informed that Hitler has declared war. Once they got there, the war grew and grew while more countries joined it, including the United States. \tThe one thing I didn\u2019t like about this book is that she put many personal things. The things I like is that she also put what and where she went during the war and the many things her dad did that got him into court, even if it\u2019s a little personal.\tI give this book a 4 star rating because even if it was a pretty good book, it still had some pretty personal things that shouldn\u2019t have been said but she did say them at her own will."}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7277963-jodi", "userReview": "This memoir was very well-written, and I love reading the stories of those who lived through hardship and terror. Their stories need to be told.That said, there was a bit of foul language and several descriptions that I felt were inappropriate and unnecessary for the story, especially considering the young audience for whom this book is intended.This is another heartbreaking account of history as told by one girl who survived Hitler's Germany. The subject matter is emotionally difficult and the circumstances hardly likeable, so books like this are always hard to rate. This wasn't a book I feel like I must have on my shelves; it was a good book to borrow (which is what I did)."}, {"userName": "Guna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6316917-guna", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book immensely. Eleanor's story was really captivating: there was love, joy, sorrow, horror, suspense - everything that a good book needs. It reminded me a bit of Anne Frank's Diary in the sense that I had a chance to see the war from a girl's/woman's perspective (and it was nothing like that war in Remarque's works; this was an atrocious war). And the fact that it's a real memoir not a piece of fiction made the story even more worthy in my eyes; I really felt for Eleanor and her family, I had little idea what people had to go through at that time to survive; and these memories do not fade. A must-read!"}, {"userName": "Maddy Pflughaupt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41553320-maddy-pflughaupt", "userReview": "The time frame of the book is about 5 years. The main character is Eleanor and she survived being in Germany during World War II. Eleanor joined Hitler Youth Group and had to compete in a huge track competition. Her mother, father, and older brother had to leave for the night so she had to take care of the little siblings by herself. She had to travel a long way to her aunt's by herself. I liked the story and I think she has an amazing story, but some parts were boring. I thought her story was great because she survived a war and had to do a lot of things by herself. I would recommend anybody to read this because it was a great story."}, {"userName": "Erin Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3199072-erin-edwards", "userReview": "Annotation and Comment: Point of view is one of the most interesting facets of this novel. Because the main character, Eleanor, in this true story had returned to Germany from America during WWII, she holds an often overlooked perspective. This novel would be a wonderful addition to any WWII or holocaust unit. It is eye-opening to discover that Germans went through hellacious times during the war. Actual photographs are included in the novel, which reminds the reader that this story is true. I found this story fascinating even though it was a bit traumatizing to read. This novel may work best in literature circles or self-selected reading for this reason."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1364753-carol", "userReview": "I think this is a must read. Especially for girls. There is some talk about what girls have to face, may embarrass boys. Did not realize it was a teen book until I got it home from the library. The story line is that a girl with German parents live in the US. They are having a hard time finding work, when an offer comes to them from Germany in 1939(?) they take it and return to Germany. Being US citizens they are left alone a little bit during the War. This story gives an idea of what life was like during the war, and after. very interesting."}, {"userName": "Carol Strange", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10839664-carol-strange", "userReview": "This book has stuck with me for the ten years since I have read it. It depicts the horrors of war experienced by the Germans from a unique point of view: an American living in Germany during World War 2. Another interesting part is when the main character returns as a teenager to the United States, her native country. She has to adjust to a culture she hasn't been in for years. The author is able to clearly show things to the readers from her point of view as she was growing up. The reader can empathize with those in situations that we hope we will never encounter."}], "description": "This dramatic autobiography of Eleanor Ramrath Garner reveals the daily struggles of growing up as a young American caught in World War II Berlin. During the Great Depression, when she is nine, Eleanor's family moves from her beloved America to Germany, where her father has been offered a good job. But war breaks out as her family is crossing the Atlantic, and they cannot return to the United States.Eleanor tries to maintain her American identity as she feels herself pulled into the turbulent life roiling around her. She fervently hopes for an Allied victory, yet for years she must try to survive the Allied bombs shattering her neighborhood. Her family faces separations, bombings, hunger, the final fierce battle for Berlin, the Russian invasion, and the terrors of Soviet occupancy.This compelling story immerses readers in the first-hand account of surviving World War II as a civilian. It's a story of trying to maintain stability, hope, and identity in a world of terror and contrasts, and it puts a very human face on the horrors of war, helping readers understand that each casualty of war is a person, not a number.", "title": "Eleanor's Story: An American Girl in Hitler's Germany", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944715.Eleanor_s_Story", "average": 4.04, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347813620l/944715.jpg", "reviews": 66, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/480433.Eleanor_Ramrath_Garner", "name": "Eleanor Ramrath Garner"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "World War II", "Autobiography", "War", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944715.Eleanor_s_Story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4617046-eleanor-s-story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4857972-eleanor-s-story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27303841-eleanor-s-story"]}
