He was clever and witty but not always wise. The man was a gambler at heart. I saw the monster \"type-writer\" that he invested huge amounts of money in at the museum/home in Hartford Connecticut. He had lots of good ideas, but was ahead of his time. That type-writer just about ruined him financially. Publishers stole his royalties by publishing his books in Canada and Great Britain but never paying him for his work. In politics he took a stand against slavery/racism in his novel Huckleberry Finn and opposed the Spanish American War in the Philippines. These were his greatest accomplishments in life. I loved the book and all the details that made it worthwhile reading."}, {"userName": "Suzanne Moore", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2127114-suzanne-moore", "userReview": "I really enjoyed listening to the audio about this amazing man. Now I want to get the hard copy and check out all the photos. There were unabridged excerpts of Twain's work read throughout the narrative of his life. A very informative and enjoyable book! As Hemingway says he is like an American Shakespeare ... a literary genius to be studied through time. Samuel Clemens lived a life of great hardships and exorbitant luxuries. He visited all seven continents and was well received at lectures where he used his unique sense of humor to tell tales of the social status of all men. He made you realize that acceptance and tolerance was the answer to finding peace and advocated equality for all. Even though some of his books have been banned for racist language and situations, the hidden message was to open your eyes and look at what was happening. Having been raised by a slave owner, he learned from his father and society\u2019s views that African Americans were wrongly persecuted and that the soul of man needed self-examination. He felt empathy for those who suffered and befriended many who were treated as white man\u2019s commodities. He based his characters on the lives of those who struggled to exist and gave us all a look at the inhumane treatment being inflicted because of Deep South prejudices. He loved children and their innocence and he also had a great affection for cats. He was a flamboyant character himself, and despite tragedies in his life and periods of poverty, he continued to remain positive, living each day to its fullest. Born November 30, 1835 and died April 21, 1910, he came in with Haley\u2019s comet and went out with the return of the comet 75 years later."}, {"userName": "(_.- Jared -._) \u20aa Book Nerd \u20aa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25528309---jared---book-nerd", "userReview": "Enjoyed it. Personally though, I am of the opinion that reading Sam's books, letter's and other writings, and coming to my own conclusions, would be more fulfilling than the reading of this condensed biography was. The writers did a great job in condensing the long life and writings of Samuele Clements/Mark Twain into one book but much was just a retelling of some of his books and the author's opinion, which I am mostly in agreement with, of Mark Twain's impact on the with regard to American literature and the subject of racism and more importantly slavery. I suppose in having read most his books and some of the collections of letters, that I was looking for some more insight into his life and history and though the book offered some of this, it did not approach my ideal expectations. For example you won't find mentioned in the entire book the word 'Mugwump'. So, to it credit, you can tell it's very well written and researched As for the 'hard core' Twain fans, the book is not very significant in it's offering more specific or esoteric information especially if you've read most or all of his works."}, {"userName": "Carol Bauer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14453645-carol-bauer", "userReview": "I just can't get enough about Mark Twain. This is a good start, though. Such a complex American, whose voice remains relevant today, should be required reading for all. I love Sam Clemens in all his forms. Small town boy, riverboat captain, lecturer, comedian, family man, cat lover, world traveler and most of all himself, complete with flaws.My only complaint, if it can be called that, was that I wanted more examples of his writing. I guess that I will have to remedy that on my own."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33331-william", "userReview": "This biography of a great author does exactly what is should: it inspires the reader to want to know even more about the author, and it especially inspires the reader to read or reread some of his works. The second half of the biography, covering Twain's immense successes and spectacular failures (business and family) -- without excusing the man of his many faults -- is most welcome."}, {"userName": "Gene Ruyle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9716605-gene-ruyle", "userReview": "This illustrated biography is the companion volume to the nearly four-hour documentary film directed by Ken Burns. Its 275 illustrations and photographs bring to mind and eye the life of both the man Samuel Langhorne Clemens and the legendary figure of Mark Twain with which it is forever fused. The varied takes and rich writing of the book's two authors, Geoffrey C. Ward and Dayton Duncan, coupled with essays and interviews from such major contributors as Russell Banks, Jocelyn Chadwick, Ron Powers, John Boyer, and Hal Holbrook make this at least the equal of three or four good books in one! If you take this fine book and the film it goes with, add to the two the masterful biography brought forth by Ron Powers -- and with all these in hand -- sign on to voyage into the two massive volumes of Twain's Autobiography already released (while you also await with many of us the arrival of its third), you will have made your way to one of the longest, unbroken, and most formative strands found in American life, language, and literature. What Twain lived his way into, especially in his difficult years at the end, cannot be said to have finished unfolding. He once said he was \"an optimist . . . who didn't arrive.\" If his last words spoken to Clara after taking her hand were \"Good-bye,\" followed by, \"If we meet . . .\", then they suggest someone still en route. Endings are not always also finishings. With lives -- especially great ones -- few ever are. Mark Twain's life remains a truly great, vital, ongoing, and irreplaceable American one of these. -G.R."}, {"userName": "Val", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1497326-val", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of the Ken Burns' program (and love its soundtrack). This is the audiobook version, so I \"lost\" the benefit of all the photographs in the print version. But? Mark Twain's words are always best read aloud anyway. AND, this is an unabridged presentation, so that is DEFINITELY a good thing!The first five discs are the bulk of the book, and the material upon which the Ken Burns film was based. Nothing new to me, though I feel it gives a very thoughtful account of Clemen's life, as juxtoposed against his writings and works. I think a lot of people who do NOT know much about Samuel Clemens will enjoy this very much, as they will find new and insightful things about Samuel Clemens the man that you wouldn't know from Mark Twain the author. It is very fine to hear a Mark Twain's words read aloud (as they are best encountered when read aloud). The sixth disc is selected readings from Twain's works, and the seventh is an analysis of Clemen's life and Twain's words and their impact on literature and on American literature. I could've mostly done without the seventh disc, but overall, I enjoyed this very much and would definitely recommend it to someone looking to find out more information on the creator of \"the American voice\" in literature."}, {"userName": "Steve Chaput", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2965629-steve-chaput", "userReview": "Mark Twain has always fascinated me and this biography only adds to that. I can't say that the book really held any surprises, since the basic elements of his background are well know. However, it was fascinating to hear from the writer's own journals and the memoirs of family & friends. In addition, Ward and his co-authors did interviews, along with reprinting articles by other writers on Twain's influence.From his well-known early childhood, growing up on the banks of his beloved Mississippi, to his later self-imposed exile to Europe and his various journeys around the world, we get to see how all of these events shaped Samuel Clemens. The personal tragedies, triumphs and misfortunes turned the self-taught journalists the skills he would later use to become one of the world's best known writers.It probably helps to have at least read Twain's best known novels (the Tom Sawyer & Huck Finn books), but Ward gives us enough material from just about all the writer's works so that we can see how he shaped his craft from his early tales to his later best-selling works."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/977989-dave", "userReview": "A nice overview of Twain's life with fascinating pictures and a balanced view of the good and bad parts of the man himself. Considering its length, its subsidiary status to the Ken Burns documentary it supports (which I haven't seen) and its stated non-comprehensiveness, it does an excellent job of getting the essentials of Twain's life in (especially his family dynamics) and inspiring the reader to go back to the books he may not have read. There's also a great inserted interview with Hal Holbrook and an essay by Jocelyn Chadwick that ought to be required reading for English teachers and librarians and other foes of censorship."}, {"userName": "John Mattox, II", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4499632-john-mattox-ii", "userReview": "This is a fabulous review of Twain's life.
