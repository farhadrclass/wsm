It isn't a how-to book in the typical sense, focusing instead on the design and development skills a craftsperson needs to go beyond following patterns and into creating their own sense of aesthetic. The author is a weaver and textile artist but design isn't constrained by medium, so the book cites metalworker, clay workers, furniture makers, surface designers and other. Often, the views that most echoed within me were not from people who work with metal, as I do, but from very different media. Tien Chiu, however, doesn't restrain herself to talking about abstract design ideas. She tackles how to work an idea into a collection, deal with practical construction issues, create models and rough drafts to develop a concept, getting around the lack of a tool or material and how to develop skills over time. All very down to Earth and practical, addressing the issues everyone of us has faced in their own work.The second half of the book goes on to address selling craftwork. Even if you aren't interested in this, the first part of the book alone is worth the price. But here she will show how to price work, control time, methods for large scale projects, finding venues, etc. Once again, very practical, including some worksheets to figure out hourly wages and detailed pricing.The final section is a delightful little bonus - short bios of all the artists that were featured in the book.I received a review copy from the publisher in return for a fair and unbiased review. Even so, I went out and bought a physical copy, because this book is just this awesome."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/709805-judy", "userReview": "I forget where I read about this book or on what website I saw it listed as a 'must read'. Hey, I'm nearing 60 and live with a 4 year old. Some days it's good that I remember my own name.But regardless of where I saw it, I am so glad I was able to obtain it from my local library via interlibrary loan. Now I just have to get my own copy.Master Your Craft by Tien Chiu is full of quotes from artists in all disciplines, as well as, tons of pictures. The strategies she outlines work for both artistic endeavors and other aspects of life. I really, really enjoyed this book.One of the first things which struck me was the concept of what you need to start designing. According to Chiu you need the following...joy in learningwillingness to produce imperfect workfaith in yourselfpersistence to overcome failureShe continually focuses on enjoying what you are doing and being willing to study, practice, and accept things not being 'perfect'.Another thing she brought out was a similar process I learned in my numerous web and graphic design classes....DesignCreateEvaluateChangeThis design cycle not only works for the arts, but over many other things you want to do in life. And this a continuous circle throughout the piece you are working on. While reading the book, I keep thinking about the quilts I am designing and planning on making. Chiu talks about getting started and making sketches of your idea, brainstorming about it and setting yourself up for creating what is in your mind. She also makes a point of saying your sketch or drawing of the 'vision' doesn't have to be complete. It is just a starting point. And as you go through the process you may change it up, resketch, rethink your idea. Another part of the process is how you will construct the item and also looking at the overall visual design aspect.This chain of events was really brought to the foreground as I am working on my \"Queen of Ween\" quilt. I didn't have a set pattern to follow created by someone else. I was creating my own design. What I did have was a set of different size panels to use, but no plan for how they were to go together. I sketched out one idea for how it would look before I started actually working with the fabric. However, after cutting out the panels and actually measuring them and hanging them on my temporary design wall, I knew my original plan wasn't going to work. So with those measurements and the panels on the wall, I redrew a sketch for the quilt based on what I actually had to work with. But one of my concerns was how I was going to join the panels together in a way which limited the number of 'y-seams' I had to sew (they are a bitch). However, once I had the second version laid out, I could actually sew the panels together with background fabric to make a set of five vertical panels, eliminating the y-seams completely. Huzzah!Most of the book is dedicated to actually going from concept to creation of your idea or product. Then she does go into selling your art and things you need to take into consideration. Chiu also talks about what happens when you make something you don't like. She suggests you set it aside for awhile and come back to it at a later date. You might find you like it after all, or you can make some changes to turn it into something you will like. This setting aside principle also works when you get to a point you are stumped about what to do. Sometimes setting a project aside gives you new eyes and ideas.I was pleased, while reading the book, I am actually 'doing' it the way she suggests. Past classes haven't been wasted even though I am not actually doing any web design or graphic arts, the principles translate well into other areas. I found I am not only thinking about my 'vision', but also more of the This is one book I want to have on my bookshelf one day!"}, {"userName": "Janet Daniels", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16192358-janet-daniels", "userReview": "There is alot to digest and to do in this book. I borrowed it from the library. I am not sure that I shouldn't buy it."}, {"userName": "Milele", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1761246-milele", "userReview": "\"Master Your Craft\" goes as far as a book can go in helping an artist on the journey from messing around to mastery. The rest is up to the artist. One unusual aspect is the choice of crafts to cover (with the advice of master craftspeople in their own field): glass-blowing, pottery, weaving, complex dyeing, hatmaking and quilting. This forces the book to be highly abstract and talk about mental strategies, planning, project management, positioning and marketing as applies to all these crafts. Yet there are specific examples to help the reader see how to map an abstract idea like \"if it isn't working make a design change\" to a real project.Another aspect I found wonderful was that a reader may have different reasons to professionalize their approach and Tien subtly incorporates many of those reasons. Some readers may not need the chapter on selling, but can adopt strategies from the rest of the book to develop faster as an artist, to increase output, to find a personal style, to learn a new craft or technique, or achieve a number of other satisfying goals.The sections on visual design, brainstorming and improvisation, could all be expanded into full books. I think here the author is limited by the size of the book to give some high-level concepts (and again, strategies) and if the artist discovers that she needs to push herself in this direction, to pursue a deeper investigation. There's a page of recommendations for further reading, but I missed that at first because it wasn't part of or at the end of the chapters that needed further reading."}, {"userName": "Leyla Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22971696-leyla-johnson", "userReview": "As an fibre artist, I work instinctively and that is great whilst the ideas are flowing, but there are times when I have a true block and everything I do, when I actually can talk myself into having a go just become too hard. This book is perfect for these moments as it pull you back and makes you think and follow a process that will make the creative juices start to flow again. No matter if you are a person like me that goes for it, or someone that likes research and planning, this is a really good book. It isn't all fluff and bubble as some of these books are but really has some very good ideas. Certainly will be a book to go to in future."}, {"userName": "Rachel B", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29349600-rachel-b", "userReview": "This book was first and foremost encouraging, as the author repeatedly reminded readers that their early work will not be great and that that is okay! The important thing is to learn from failure, constantly improve, and enjoy the process.While the tips and exercises could be helpful for some, much of what was written about the design process seemed obvious to me; therefore, I think this book would be most helpful to intuitive artists who are not naturally in tune with the practical considerations involved in designing or those who are hesitant to honestly critique their own work.Much of the book focuses on the design process and the \"editing\" that goes on during the making (which is just an extension of the design process, in my opinion). There is one short chapter on selling work, but artists who are interested in that aspect will undoubtedly be better served by reading a book devoted solely to that topic.My favorite part was reading the excerpts from, and bios of, established artists who work with all different mediums.I received this book from the publisher via NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Rebekah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20953136-rebekah", "userReview": "Fantastic book! First I loved how honest, encouraging and relationallyrics she wrote. The book had many technical elements fir advanced artists but also a lot of encouragement for beginners and good advice for both! How to increase your creativity, skill or business aspects as a most general summary. I loved this quote \" What do you need to get started ' joy in learning, a willingness to prove imperfect work, faith in yourself and the persistence to overcome failure'\". Words like hogwash made the book less intimating to a more novice artist like me, while I still got a look into what all goes into the advanced designs and professional work. And the Exercises, like writing or thinking prompts, were great and really got me thinking!"}, {"userName": "Anne-Marie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15243347-anne-marie", "userReview": "Master Your Craft takes the reader through a series of steps designed to nurture the creative process, all the way from finding inspiration to selling the finished creations. I was sold the moment I opened the first chapter to read what is needed even to start the journey, and found \u201cwillingness to be imperfect\u201d.This book gives clear, practical paths to designing unique items, and puts high emphasis on analysis and evaluation of both the process and the product. Throughout the book, an impressive collection of masters in very different arts share their thoughts on elements of their work. Their contributions inspire further thought.
