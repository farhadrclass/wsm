I'm smoking, life is smoke, and my name is Smoky, Smoky Barrett. My real name, given to me because my mother thought it \"sounded cool.\" This makes me cackle in the dark, in my empty house, and I think as I laugh (as I have before) just how crazy laughter sounds when you're laughing alone.\" page 60-62 letter from Jack Jr \"To Special Agent Smoky J. Barrett ... I was not the victim of sexual or physical abuse as a child. I was not a bedwetter, and I did not torture small animals. I am something far purer, I am a legacy. ... From Hell, Jack Jr.\" page 84 Smoky narrates \"I am growing dizzier, and the tears just seem to keep on coming. Grief is like that sometimes. Like water, it finds any opening, forces itself through any crack until it explodes, ... I have only a moment to realize what's happening. I'm passing out. Then things go dark.\" page 91 Smoky narrates \"... we both have compassion for what Leo is going through. This is a crucial moment for those in our profession. It is the blooding. The point where you peer into the abyss for the first time,where you find out that the boogeyman really does exist and really has been hiding under the bed all those years. Where you come face-to-face with real evil. We know this is where Leo will either recover or find a new line of work.\" page 98 Smoky narrates \"My gaze is fixed on the faraway. Because the dark train is coming.\" \"I met the dark train (as i call it) during my very first case. It is a thing hard to describe. The train of life runs on the tracks of normality and reality. Its passengers are not perfect, but they do their best.\" \"The dark train is different.\" \"The dark train runs on tracks made of crunching, squishy things. It's the train that people like Jack Jr ride. it's a train fueled by murder and sex and screams. The conductor is the monster you are chasing, and he has many guises. Sometimes, rarely, he can be a she. On the dark train, you see the conductor as he really is, underneath the fake smiles ... These killers I hunt are not quiet and smiling inside. Every cell in their body is an unending scream.\" page 100 Smoky narrates \"I look around the room, letting it seep into me. I can feel him, smell him. I need to be able to taste him, hear him. rather than pushing him away, I need to pull him close. Like a lover.\" \"It is exciting. He hunts everything. I only hunt him. But I suspect my taste for blood is just as rich and strong.\" page 164 Jack Jr letter \"I am sure you have all wondered: Why am I challenging you so directly? ... I challenge you because you deserve me. You hunt the hunters, and, I feel certain, you have spent many years patting each other on the back. ... And so you deserve me. Because if these others you have hunted are shadows, I am darkness itself. ... Hunt me.\" page 187 Smoky narrates \"The truth is, bad things are going to happen somewhere, every single day, and today was just your turn. ...\" \"The simple fact is that evil preys on good, and today, good had a bad day.\" page 327 Smoky narrates \"I have always been fascinated by books and movies about serial killers.

The reviews were strong, and with the recommendation in my mind, I took this one on with high expectations. Apparently they weren't high enough though, because after just the first few chapters my expectations were blown away! What I loved:-This book is rich with strong characters that really come to life. I can't stress this enough--McFayden really knows how to write characters with depth, realistic emotions and emotional responses that will make you wonder how in the world this wasn't written by a woman? From the main protag to a potential murder victim, McFayden didn't skimp on character development. -While I obviously loved all the characters, I have to give recognition to the protagonist Smokey Barrett and the antagonist, the Shadow Man himself. Smokey, who has lost so much and is still healing physically and mentally from an extreme home invasion is someone I won't soon forget. If she is based on a real life detective, then the world is a much better place. The Shadow Man, holy #*%> is this one messed up psycho! The mind games, manipulations and psychological warfare he uses to throw Smokey and her team off their game is unlike anything else I've read.  Keep in mind there are some scenes that are not for the faint hearted!!( Don't you always wonder where an author comes up with this stuff?)-McFayden's writing style...it's beautiful, smooth, eloquent, and creative. Whether writing an emotional moment or describing a crime scene, McFayden has a unique way of really making you feel what the characters are experiencing. My favorite? Has to be 'the Train'...Describing Smokey's internal brain preparing her for the investigation ahead.-Last, I'd have to say I was really impressed with the research that went into this book...my buddy and I were amazed at some of the things we learned, both police procedural as well as about the psychology behind some practices. I love a book that makes me feel smarter when I'm done.What I didn't love:-Not a whole lot!! But no book is flawless, and I did find some areas that left me wanting more. There were a few scenes that the author glossed over without providing details, and I felt a bit robbed. There were also a couple of loose ends not addressed at the end that I wish had been cleaned up. But, all is forgiven...he certainly makes up for it and then some!You will notice that I haven't written one word about what this book is about. I didn't want to waste my review on that...the synopsis does a fine job. I really just wanted to give credit to this author and his writing. It's something you need to experience, so go---get your hands on this book and settle in for a wild ride!"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine", "userReview": "Five stars vastly underrates this book. I give the brilliant Shadow Man 10 stars. Easily. Cory McFadyen\u2019s Shadow Man is the best thriller I have read. In my life. Ever.By the time I reached the 5% mark, I knew this book was going to be special. I paused long enough to race over to Amazon to order the other 3 books in the series. I was instantly transfixed in chapter one, and the book did not lessen its grip on me from that point on. The last 25% of the book was simply unputdownable. Truly. Shadow Man is a masterpiece thriller, in my humble opinion. It ticks off all the boxes important to me. The character development is simply stunning and unlike that I have ever seen in any other thriller. We even learn about the minor characters. Deep stuff. Psychological stuff. The stuff that makes these people who they are and what they do and think. There are whole chapters devoted to where the team members are psychologically. Boring, you say? Far, far from it. This is deep, meaningful, and dare I say, moving storytelling. Agent Smoky Barrett is the female leader of a team of FBI agents. The team members\u2019 interactions are real, and though certainly not all a bowl of cherries, reflect steadfast loyalty and respect when it counts. Even the assholes have integrity. I came to love every member of the team.Smoky has been through horrendous trauma for which she is receiving psychiatric help. These sessions are shown to us and are fascinating, even to me--a survivor of a 3-month rotation in lock up psychiatry during my medical residency. The encounter in chapter 2 is the best written, most powerful and moving patient-psychiatrist encounter I have ever read in a novel. I must extend my praise to the psychological aspects throughout the entire book. If I didn\u2019t know otherwise, I would definitely think that the author was a board-certified psychiatrist. Even though this book was written in 2007, I learned a lot about police work. I now know about cognitive interviewing of witnesses, neurolinguistic interviewing of suspects, what a \u201cconfrontational statement\u201d is and when it should be used, how to detect whether or not a package contains a bomb, how latex gloves do not always prevent the leaving of fingerprints, what makes up the psyche of a serial killer, and more. And these techniques and facts, like the psychological aspects of the novel, are shown and not just told to us. I cannot stress what a difference showing, rather than just telling, makes to a story. There is a hint, just a hint of a budding romance, but I have to say chapter 39 holds the most beautiful and emotional sex scene I think I have ever read. I must issue one warning. The thriller aspects to the story are intense, dark and depraved. It takes a lot to scare me off, and I had no major issues tolerating the degree of evil and debasement depicted in Shadow Man, but I do understand it will be too much for some readers. Otherwise, the plot was complex and suspenseful. It was intriguing watching the FBI team go from nearly no leads at all to cracking the case. The clues are there if you are smart enough to follow them, but I was fooled big time in the end. If I have one criticism, it is that the case broke on a clue that I\u2019m not sure was good enough to earn that honor, but that was more than made up for by the very original and touching as well as explosive final scene with the killer.Do I recommend this book? Are you kidding me? I want to go to each and every one of my thriller-loving friends, especially those who love thrillers with strong character development, such as Angela Marsons\u2019 Kim Stone series, and COMMAND them put this book on the very top of their lists. Do you hear me, people??? In regards to the darkness factor, I do believe if a reader can handle Karin Slaughter\u2019s works, then he or she can get through Shadow Man. Thriller fans, do not deprive yourself of this most brilliant book. Final thoughts:1) Cory McFadyen has apparently disappeared off the face of the literary world. There is no Google data on him for the last several years. This is tragic.2) There are 3 (4 if you can read German) more Smoky Barrett books for me to read; this simultaneously pleases me and disappoints me.3) I want to thank my friend Jan for suggesting we read this book together or I may have never gotten to it. Thank you, buddy!!"}, {"userName": "Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14233569-mary-beth-traveling-sister", "userReview": "I just loved this book. This book isn't for everyone. It was definitely for me! This book is very horrifying! Its not for the faint of heart. I had to put it down a couple of times because in some parts I just could not handle it. It is an excellent book. The author writes so well! It is very suspenseful. Its so hard for me to say what its about because I don't want to spoil it. Also I can not put in words the justice that this book deserves. I can tell you that if you are a fan of Karin Slaughter, this book is definitely for you. It can get violent but the author also for a man writes very well for woman. This book does have sugar added to it. The book starts out with a bang that does not stop. The suspense just about killed me.The character development in this book is so awesome. I loved each character except the villain. I loved Callie, and just adored the little girl Bonnie who is a very strong and tough girl. I just loved Smoky Barrett. And I can't forget Elaina who adds the sugar. She is just sunshine.Shadow Man will grab you by the throat and yank you along for a hell of a ride, so hold on to your seat. A spell binding read from the first page to the last. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series. It definitely meets the Wow factor. It really Wowed me and want more."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda", "userReview": "First, a warning. Future readers should be aware that there is an abundance of gore, depravity, and evil in this book, and it is not left to the imagination! It is also countered with love and hope and loyalty.By the end of the first chapter, I was completely hooked by this book. For me, it was very emotional. I melded myself with everything Smoky was feeling: fear, sorrow, depression, suicidal. And a few chapters later, I loved her team as she did. The cast of characters in this book are just fantastic! But there are some head butts in this book, and oh, God, did they hurt!The villain in this book causes much psychological damage as well as physical damage. Every member of the team is personally affected. It is sickening. Heartbreaking. It ramps up the tension and makes them angry. Accomplishes what the villain wanted.I was so immersed in the story, in the investigation, in Smoky's thoughts and feelings, that I never even thought about who Jack Jr. was. And when a name was finally mentioned, it was unfamiliar to me and I had to think back through the book to see if he'd been mentioned yet!The author has written a rather unique description of how Smoky gets inside the head of an evil psychopath. Smoky calls it \"the dark train.\" I liked it and want to remember it. I am happy to ride the dark train with these characters in the remaining three books!"}, {"userName": "Sherri", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3034845-sherri", "userReview": "Today on Cooking With Plagiarism, we're going to work on a little recipe called \"Shadow Man.\" This is a pretty spicy dish, and will be too hot for those of you who are sensitive to too much gore and pretty much unpalatable to those of you who like your plots without holes. For the rest of you, let's get started. First, when cooking with plagiarism its important to start of right. Pull your very COVER from another source to give your audience a head's up on what to expect. Don't be too blatant though or they might not try the dish. So, instead of a white video-game cover with a black half profile, try black-on-black. It'll look cooler anyways. Next, take a handful of things sure to sell well and combine them into a bowl. Here we tried a handful of Disney \"kill-off-mom\" sauce, a dash of \"sterio-typical strong female lead\" (remember, she must ALWAYS be under 5 feet and horribly traumatized!). Add a HUGE dollop of Thomas Harris plots (go especially heavy on the \"Red Dragon\" and quite heavy on the \"Hannibal\" death-scene spices). Stir until they have completely lost anything that made them tasty or original. Now the important touches. If you'd like, you can throw in some scars, but make sure they don't actually interfere with anything that makes your lead physically function-able or less attractive. Throw in a pat of half-melted two-dimensional support characters. As in all these recipes, you must have the sassy female, the @$$h0le, the innocent computer guy and DON'T FORGET the token minority! These are only there for plot pieces, no no worries if the only ones you have around the house are stale. You'll need a character motivator: In this case may I suggest \"traumatized but tough urchin.\" You may have to marinate it in its mother's corpse first to make it cook-able, but no worries, its only there for texture anyways. Its not like it had any real personality to start with, so you shouldn't feel bad for it. Finally, you should make sure to add some sex, because that sells. If you don't have any, its okay. Just pull out whatever open box of \"crappy romance novel\" you have in the cupboard and toss it in. Now, strain this glop through a colander. The size of the strainer is especially important. You need one with slots small enough to leave in the \"excruciating gun details\" but large enough to strain out any feelings of realism in your plot. When in doubt, err on the size of too large. Losing a few gun facts is worth getting rid of as much realism as possible. Once you have your straining done, slap it between two covers and bake. Makes 373 pages."}, {"userName": "David Staniforth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16602614-david-staniforth", "userReview": "Not one for the squeamish!This is the kind of book that makes me glad I joined Goodreads and that I have friends whose recommendations I trust, for without that I would never have read \"Shadow Man\". The cover wouldn't have drawn me in and I'd never heard of the author, so not something I would have selected while casually browsing in the library.Brilliant writing style that gripped me from the opening paragraph and never let go. Fantastic character development. Intense action. Perfect pacing and plot. And an exhilarating conclusion.

It gets lots of five star reviews but it didn't really hit the spot for me.I enjoyed the story and it had some tense moments. The characters were okay but I felt as though I had met them in many other crime books before. What bothered me the most though was the melodrama. Everyone seemed to be overcome by their feelings about something and the main characters alternated between vomiting in waste baskets and fainting due to extreme stress. Repeatedly.I thought the mystery itself was good and I did not guess who the murderer was. I guess my final conclusion will be three stars for a satisfying but not overwhelmingly good crime thriller."}, {"userName": "Mohikanos", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2018", "userURL":

A super tough female heroine, with a traumatized past, who has became the main target of a twisted serial killer's bloody game that gives you lots of gore. I mean sure, it's a tale as old as time in this genre. It's been done to death, but when it's done well? Who gives a fuck? It's a wild, tense, dark and twisty ride. I have a hard time believing this is the first novel ever written by Cody McFadyen but that's the line I'm being fed, so sure, ok, Mr McFadyen this is your first novel ever, riiiiggghhhttt. McFadyen infused the pages with psychological insight into the main character, Agent Smoky Barrett, and police procedural factoids that cut the horror and evil with human qualities and a sense of reality. It created a story that was really well rounded in so many ways. The crimes were pretty dark, bloody and gory. The chase for the killers was fast paced and fun, with lots of procedural insight into serial killers and the people who catch them. The characters were well thought out, dynamic in their unique personalities, giving you a real sense of family/team and a vested interest in the outcome of their journey. My only real gripes with the books would be the Jack the Ripper line, which felt a little too easy as a plot device and the sense of timing...The first part of book sets up Smoky and her past, her journey in recovery, and quite frankly, she's fucked up. Nightmares, panic attacks, only 6 months has gone by since her family was murdered and she was tortured almost to death. She's right where you'd expect her to be emotionally, which is barely hanging on. And then, it seems, overnight, the death of her best friend spurs her into an unprecedented 180 recovery and she's back leading an FBI team and solving crimes and adopting children who are coming out of their own personal horror way to quickly. Relationships are forged, things are wrapped up and life is moving on all within the span of a week or so. It was too fast, and I kept thinking, yeah, that wouldn't happen. Took me out of it just a little bit.Extra points for making me cry into my wine because of Leo's dog, though. I hardly ever cry. I'm pretty much dead inside. I wouldn't necessarily call this a mystery, as the police drama/thriller aspect overshadowed who Jack Jr was. By the time he was revealed I felt I didn't care all that much, I just wanted to see him die and see Smoky win. I'm super excited that this is a series, though. It was a really promising start that creeped me out, surrounded me with darkness and poked at my emotions. 4 \u00bd stars!"}, {"userName": "Laura/Mystery in Minutes ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19061124-laura-mystery-in-minutes", "userReview": "Spoiler-Free ReviewAre you a fan of the often very dark and edgy show \"Criminal Minds\"?The show about the Behavioral Analysis Unit at the FBI (read: profilers)?I haven't watched the show in years (for reasons having nothing to do with the quality of the show), so I don't know if it has changed since then, but, for me, the tone of Cody McFadyen's first Smoky Barrett novel is very reminiscent of that show that I remember.\nSo, what did I love about Shadow Man?\nI loved the depiction of camaraderie and loyalty that Smoky's immediate, and extended, FBI team has toward one another. That \"I have your back, no matter what\" bond that so many in law enforcement share. The acceptance of one another's quirks because they are all highly skilled at what they do and passionate about it, and because their very lives often depend upon that level of acceptance and trust.I loved Smoky's feeling of responsibility toward her team. In fact, her devotion to her team and their families - these men and women that the reader experiences as fully \"fleshed-out\" characters - is what ultimately brings Smoky back to the FBI, after an incident with a perpetrator left her unsure as to whether or not she would be able to return to work. Throughout the novel, the reader watches Smoky gradually becoming stronger, and healing in various ways from that devastating event. I grew to care very deeply for *most* of the characters. And for those of you who have already read the novel (not a spoiler), I even came to find the expression \"honey-love\" endearing.Prior to starting the book, I was a bit apprehensive about the level of violence that I had been advised of, but I did not find it to be drawn out, or gratuitous.Cody McFadyen's debut novel is so much more than \"just genre fiction\".\nCombining character-rich psychological exploration and suspense, top-notch investigative procedure, red herrings of subtlety and finesse, as well as passages of literary prose evoking great emotion, Shadow Man is an example of what truly great crime fiction can be.\n Will I take another ride on the \"dark train\" with the next book in the series?Absolutely.\nSix stars for Shadow Man by Cody McFadyen."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13229289-diana", "userReview": "Wow ... extremely dark!

Robb\u2026Cody McFadyen? I truly mean this as the highest compliment, Mr. McFadyen. As I read the opening pages of your spectacular thriller, Shadow Man, I had to look back to see your name again. Yes, I had read it correctly; I simply could not believe that the emotions and sensations that were emanating from my Kindle had come from the psyche of a man. I know that I am not the first reviewer to say this, but this was my overwhelming first impression, and I was awestruck.Smoky Barrett is no ordinary FBI agent. What makes her special is not that she leads a violent crimes unit in LA or that she fires her Glock more accurately than almost any other agent in the Bureau or even that she has lost her husband, child, and good looks to a vicious killer. What makes Smoky Barrett one of the best agents, male or female, is that she has the ability to read her prey \u2013 almost get inside the head of the perpetrator. Then look out! Here comes \u201cthe dark train\u201d! Chug-a-chug-a-chug. She feels the dragon inside\u2026the dragon that is her anger, her strength, and her hunger for justice.Smoky\u2019s crime-chasing is made more masterful by her team of two genuinely wonderful human beings, Callie and Alan, who also happen to be extremely skilled at what they do, plus James, a man who is a big jerk but is able to get in the zone like Smoky can and \u201cfeel\u201d the perp. They are joined on this case by a rookie, Leo, who is a computer nerd. Poor Leo has a rude awakening at his first crime scene, but he toughens up in a hurry.This is a good place to warn the reader: This is not your sweet grandma\u2019s cozy mystery. It is brutal. There is violent sex and torture of women (and a dog). Karen Slaughter and Tess Gerritsen\u2019s killers have nothing on this evil butcher. He is smart, careful, confident, and extremely cruel.Fortunately, there is some balance. It comes in the form of kind, caring people. The supporting cast consists of fabulous characters. Even though there is a lot of pain in their lives, they bring love and stability into one another\u2019s lives. Even Matt and Alexa, Smoky\u2019s dead husband and daughter, speak to her in her head and guide her.The plot is strengthened by solid details of Smoky\u2019s therapy sessions, FBI interview techniques, and forensics nuts-and-bolts that are quite fascinating. Then there are the gruesome descriptions of the videos. These are definitely not for everyone.As a mystery, Shadow Man isn\u2019t exceptional. I had a strong hunch early on as to the identity of the psychopathic monster. It is the depiction of the terror \u2013 the sights, the sounds, the heart-stopping fears that makes this story a top-notch thriller. When Smoky wakes up from a nightmare, I felt her jolt. I saw her drenched with sweat. I heard her sob. When McFadyen describes the dark train, I was there. My heart was pounding, my fists were clenched, and my senses were heightened. This total immersion was not an occasional occurrence; it was a constant state from start to finish.I had a very few minor peeves about this book. One, I got extremely tired of Callie\u2019s \u201choney love\u201d phrase every time she spoke to anyone. I loved Callie, but that phrase started grating after a while. Secondly, while the killer made a mistake or two, the biggest one seemed too manufactured to be accidental. I don\u2019t know whether that was intentional on the author\u2019s part or not, but it didn\u2019t quite fit. Still, that in no way ruined the story for me, as the final chapters were amazingly pressure-packed. Really good stuff. Great, actually. This is a very easy five star rating.There is good news and bad news about Cody McFadyen. Good news: There are three more Smoky Barrett books, plus one in German (which I hope, hope, hope will be translated some day). Bad news: McFadyen seems to have vanished from the world of books.

But when her best friend is killed by a serial killer who believes he is the ancestor of Jack the Ripper, she is pulled back in to the FBI by the killer himself. She soon finds her team helps make her feel needed as she chases the murderer. I read a lot of mysteries and thrillers but I must say this one took me to uncomfortable places. Smoky has a talent that allows her to see a crime scene through the killer\u2019s eyes which she calls \"riding the dark train.\" This particular killer is the epitome of darkness and evil, relishing in torturing the innocent. The FBI team is an interesting mix and the writing truly makes you care about these characters.

I did some research; discovered that the author seems to have disappeared from the public writing arena (which is mysterious in itself) and that there are four books written in this particular series. So in I went and came away mostly happy - mostly! It was wasn't perfect, but here's what I thought.It's clear from early on that McFadyen can write. His writing reads well with elegant prose that flows along at a compelling pace that hooks when necessary. Character depth is pretty deep here as we're given backstory to most of the people present. Quite unusual I found and I'm not sure where I sit with it. In some instances I can see why it was necessary; others, not so much. It did feel a bit like plodding occasionally to get to the good bits. From the blurb we know that the main protagonist is Smoky Barrett, an all singing and dancing FBI agent at the top of her game, well usually, until she's beset by a huge tragedy that knocks her sideways and is compelled to undertake counselling. On the whole I liked the character. My sticking point was the name, Smoky??!! I mean, seriously??!! Couldn't get my head around that one and for one that was lacking somewhat in stature (same as my eldest daughter who I seriously couldn't picture taking on the bad guys in spite of her tenacious spirit!), she made up for in gun toting skills and a drive that seemed a tad unrealistic given all that had happened to her. Putting that aside, I liked all the cohorts and the fiendishly bad guy that was without any remorse in his quest to prove his intelligence.The plotline is good and it's clearly well researched. I have to say it reminded me of Patricia Cornwell's earlier books in the descriptiveness at times which is no bad thing. And I can see other authors creeping in too, namely Robert Harris with Hannibal. It certainly had a feel of those types of books and I know much has been said that it's not for the faint hearted. Well, no, it's not - but if you can handle those authors I've mentioned and the likes of Slaughter, Hayder, Bauer then this is fine. Though it is shocking so be prepared.With all that said, I shall leave it there and finish by saying that overall I really did enjoy this book for the most part. Some great characters, a good story in which I didn't guess the end and a curiosity to see what is going to be in store for particular characters further down the line. Especially Bonnie, the little girl tragically caught up in all the horror and hopefully rescued - rescued enough to find some peace and happiness that she thoroughly deserves. Bless her heart.I shall be reading more.

It is possibly one of the best series I have ever read. YES! It is that good!Shadow Man introduces Smokey Barrett 6 months after a brutally traumatic experience. A killer she had been chasing breaks into her home, rapes and tortures her, leaving her with horrific facial scars. He also kills her husband young daughter.Six months later and she still hasn't decided whether she wants to live or die. And then something happens that changes the game. Her very best childhood friend is found brutally murdered and her young daughter, Bonnie, was tied to her mother's dead body for 3 days until they were found. Bonnie has been catatonic since then ... and according to her friend's will, Smokey is to have guardianship.Even though she hasn't been cleared by her psychiatrist to return to work, she manages to talk her supervisor into letting her investigate the crime along with her team, but only on the fringe of things.Thus begins the hunt for one of the nastiest, cruelest killers known. He taunts Smokey and her team by promising to take away something from everyone on her team .. he wants them at their best when they go to look for him. The things he does to this team is heinous.All the books in this series is extremely well written. You cannot tell from the writing that this is the author's very first book. The characters ... you will follow them from book to book to see how they grow and change. And you will want to read the others in this series after reading this one.I feel sad that there are only the 4 books. The author disappeared a time after his 4th book ... and to this day, no one seems to know what happened to him. Just took a walkabout? Died? Writing under a different name?

This psychological tale centres around Smoky,an FBI agent,who is currently recovering from a brutally vicious attack,which resulted in the murder of her husband and daughter,all thanks to a psychopath named J.Sands. She is at a crossroads in her life and must decide if she's physically,emotionally and psychologically ready to return to a job she loved,or take a different route,one of no return. Confronted with the violent death of her friend Annie,she now finds herself with the added responsibility of her ten year old goddaughter Bonnie,who,having witnessed the murder of her mother,is deep in shock and can no longer speak. Annie is but the first victim of this new serial killer who seems to have a special message for Smoky and her team...thus we are lead on the torturous journey to track the killer and are invited into the depths of Jack Jnr's evil and twisted mind. This was an amazing story,one that I found equally compelling and grotesque! Some elements in this book are very disturbing and therefore,dear reader,are not for the faint hearted. Having said that there were so many facets of this book that I really enjoyed-the beautifully scripted tale,the back story that was provided for Smoky and her team,which allowed us a window into their lives,their personal worries,which,in turn,transformed them from being paper characters to real life people. I also loved the style that this tale was written in,the short,sharp chapters,the sheer tumult of emotions that I felt while reading, not to mention the unique and clever way the killer's identity was established. So,yes,dear reader,I can highly recommend this tale and trust that you will find it as compelling and intriguing as I."}, {"userName": "Vicky Ziliaskopoulou", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017",

How could I resist immediately getting this book and reading it! Although I don\u2019t completely agree with her 10 star assessment, it was still an extremely entertaining, thrilling read!Smoky Barrett was a top FBI agent hunting serial killers until one night her and her family were terrorised by one. Her husband and daughter were killed, leaving Smokey alone and dealing with a whole lot of grief. When her best friend is killed by someone claiming to be a direct descendent of Jack the Ripper, Smokey is thrust back in to help with the case. This killer is after her too, and will stop at nothing to get her.I have read a lot of praise for McFadyen\u2019s writing and I have to agree. The whole book was extremely well written. It flowed extremely well and the quality of the writing made up for any shortfalls in the novel.The characters were all very deep and disturbed. Each had something going on. Smoky herself was obviously damaged. I didn\u2019t think anyone could write a character who had suffered through such tragedy, but McFadyen does a good job of it. Not a fantastic job mind you, but he made Smoky likeable, and not too depressing. The story about what happened to her was the stuff of nightmares and did not skimp on the gory details. The secondary characters were all well established. Except maybe for her secret service friend who I found just to be an added love interest without real substance \u2013 hopefully in subsequent novels we will learn more about him. Not that I think there should have been a love interest in it at all really. I get what he was trying to do, but I didn\u2019t find it believable. Her team are a great bunch of characters, and Bonnie also. Really well written. And man.. Confronting!The action and violent scenes were thrilling. Non stop at times! Definitely a page turner.So why haven\u2019t I rated this higher? Its because even though it was written so masterfully, I knew who the killer was. The whole way through. I find it utterly disappointing when I pick it up, and I confidently picked it up quickly with this one. And it left a bad taste in my mouth. I felt quite ripped off to be honest.However fabulous writing redeems. Looking forward to number 2!!Would I recommend Shadow Man?Yes, but for die hard thriller fans who don\u2019t mind a LOT of graphic violence, blood, guts and gore.

Fall Geschmackssache.Die h\u00f6chstbegabte FBI-Agentin Smoky Barrett ist taffer als Clarice Starling und obwohl ihr K\u00f6rper mit Narben \u00fcberzogen ist nicht weniger attraktiv als Jodie Foster - so will es McFadyen.Nachdem Smoky Kind und Mann verloren hat und selbst Opfer eines psychopathischen Vergewaltigers wurde, muss sie sich in der BLUTLINIE m\u00e4chtig am Riemen rei\u00dfen, um nach ihrer Auszeit zur\u00fcck in den Dienst zu finden und den Mord an ihrer Freundin Annie aufzukl\u00e4ren, die das Schicksal mit einem noch brutaleren Psychopathen bedacht hat.Zu Beginn aufs H\u00f6chste dosiert zelebriert McFadyen die Pathetik der H\u00e4rte, dann kann er endlich bei den Beschreibungen des Mordes an Annie \u00fcbergehen in die Rhetorik des Grauens. Beispiel: Wer den \"schwarzen Zug\" besteigt - sich also in die Welt des psychopathischen Killers hineinversetzt -, der erlebt einen \"Klimawandel der Seele\". OmG!Gar nicht widerlich genug kann es McFadyen bei der detaillierten Beschreibung des unbeschreiblichen Martyriums der Opfer zugehen, denn die Konkurrenz auf dem Thriller Markt ist hart. Ich wei\u00df nicht, ob es sp\u00e4ter spannend wird, einstweilen findet der Autor nur Raum f\u00fcr Perversionen und Pseudoforensik.Sprachlich auf vorsichtig ausgedr\u00fcckt nicht besonders hohem Niveau beschreibt der Autor Smoky und ihr Team auf eine Weise, die in jeder Hinsicht, also f\u00fcr den Leser wie f\u00fcr die Figuren, verzweifelt genannt werden darf. Mit Abstand am Schlimmsten allerdings ist, dass die Charaktere und ihr Handeln psychologisch extrem unglaubw\u00fcrdig sind. McFadyen geht es nur um Horror, nicht um Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit. Ein Trauma jagt das andere, und es ist nicht leicht, sich immer noch schlimmere Wendungen auszudenken. McFadyen setzt immer noch einen drauf, allerdings nicht qualitativ, sondern nur quantitativ.Ungef\u00e4hr gegen H\u00e4lfte des H\u00f6rbuches habe ich jegliches Interesse an Smoky und ihren Kollegen verloren.Pr\u00e4dikat: besonders ungenie\u00dfbar - und aus!OK, nach f\u00fcnf Tagen Abstand bedarf es doch noch einer Klarstellung. Was also st\u00f6rt mich so an der BLUTLINIE?Nat\u00fcrlich will ich McFadyen nicht unterstellen, dass er pervers veranlagt ist, er bedient ein Genre, das boomt und von dem der Leser offenbar eine immer h\u00e4rtere Gangart erwaretet. Andererseits ist er f\u00fcr das verantwortlich, was der da zu Papier bringt, und es geht ausschlie\u00dflich um fast lustvoll dargestellte sexuelle Gewalt und Perversion. Unterw\u00e4sche, H\u00f6schen und BH, werden am Flie\u00dfband zerrissen, die Narben, die Smoky von ihrem Peiniger davongetragen hat und die ihr Gesicht, ihren Hals und ihren K\u00f6rper \u00fcberziehen, werden beim Sex als Charaktermerkmal bezeichnet, aus dem Smokys St\u00e4rke erkennbar sei. Geht\u00b4s noch?Es wird nicht einfach vergewaltigt und gemordet, die Opfer werden nicht nur zerst\u00fcckelt, sondern mit einem fast wohligen Schauer beschreibt McFadyen, wie sie ausgeweidet werden. In einem Einmachglas sollen sich die Sexualorgane einer Frau befinden. Und immer wieder Gewalt, Gewalt, Gewalt. Tierqu\u00e4lerei, Sadismus, Mord. Frauenfeindlichkeit ist die Grundlage, auf der alles Exzesse gedeihen.Ich frage mich, wie sich Franziska Pigulla gef\u00fchlt hat, als sie diesen widerw\u00e4rtigen Text vorgelesen hat.Denn noch einmal ganz deutlich: was Fadyen hier geschrieben hat, hat nichts mit Spannung zu tun. Im Gegenteil, ohne die Gewaltexzesse w\u00e4re die Handlung langweilig, ja es bliebe nicht einmal etwas von ihr \u00fcbrig.Wer kann die Lekt\u00fcre geniessen? In einigen Rezensionen wurde geschrieben, die Figuren seien psychologisch glaubw\u00fcrdig und gut gezeichnet. Sorry, aber das ist einfach nicht zutreffend und soll m\u00f6glicherweise nur Rechtfertigung daf\u00fcr sein, dass die BLUTLINIE eine Saite zum Klingen bringt, die den Leser dazu treibt, den ganzen Roman zu lessen, aller Widerw\u00e4rtigkeiten zum Trotz.Im ANTON REISER gibt es eine wunderbare Stelle, wo Anton zwei sich gegen\u00fcberliegen feindliche Heere, bestehend aus Eicheln und Haseln\u00fcssen (oder so \u00e4hnlich) aufbaut und dann gen\u00fcsslich mit einem Hammer beliebig mal auf die eine, dann wieder auf die andere Seite eindrischt. Es bereit Anton, der es im Leben schwer genug hat, offensichtlich eine nicht unerhebliche Genugtuung, selber einmal in die Rolle des blindw\u00fctigen Schicksals zu schl\u00fcpfen. Auf diese eine Passage kommen f\u00fcnfzig Autoren in der Qualit\u00e4t eines McFadyen!"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32444698-amy", "userReview": "TEN SHINY, \"bleeping\" STARS. I know that is inappropriate, but my dear God. This book is terrifying. It's basically a psychological warfare on one's mind that things like this actually happen. People can be plain, old psychopaths. There is no cure for that and what is worse, there's more of them than we imagine. I can't believe this was a debut novel. It is well written, gripping and the most twisted book I have ever read. Not that I am a library of knowledge, but I know what a great book reads like and this sure as hell is it. If you like a great thriller, an awe inspiring resilient protagonist and a brilliantly twisted plot, this book is for you. If you can't take gruesome, violent and gut wrenching, then definitely take a pass on this series starter. Well done, McFadyen.

Yes, its the story of a serial killer and some of the scenes are not nice and are uncomfortable, but I would expect this in a story about a deranged, crazy person who kills other people for kicks. The story also has some great characters and Smoky is so likable, and her backstory so tragic and sad. There are plenty of emotionally damaged people in this book but it definitely grabbed me and I can't wait to read the next one."}], "description": "Once, Special Agent Smoky Barrett hunted serial killers for the FBI.
