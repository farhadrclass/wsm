At least that's my experience with Tomato Red - a book I was considering setting aside somewhere in the first third of it or so, having never been a particular fan of this particular brand of hopeless bleak humor. But something in it made me keep going, and I have no regrets.The only Woodrell I've read until now was Winter's Bone, the bleak and chilling story of Ozarks where meth is the king and overwhelming poverty is reality. Well, the setting here is similar in feel and tone, and pervasive hopelessness is another common thread. But in Winter's Bone we had a real protagonist - tough-as-nails Ree Dolly who was a ray of hope in the oppressive bleakness. Tomato Red instead gives up Sammy Barlach, a pathetic young kid \"who should in any circumstances be considered a suspect\", with drug addiction, no prospects, and the overwhelming desire to belong, to be accepted, to be loved. Sammy does find a ragtag bunch from the wrong side of the tracks that seems to accept him with no questions asked - by their own sad admission, maybe not even the lowest scum in town: an aging prostitute Bev Merrihew and her children Jason (a strikingly beautiful young boy struggling with his homosexuality) and Jamalee, a girl with tomato-red hair, a girl whose greatest ambition is to get out of the squalor of her hometown.\n\"This expression of utter frankness takes over Jason's beautiful face, and he says, 'I don't think we're the lowest scum in town.' He didn't argue that we weren't scum, just disputed our position on the depth chart.\"\nIt's Jamalee, a little flame with her tomato-red hair - or maybe hair the color of blood? - who is not content with being the (almost) lowest scum in town. And it's Jamalee who (as you can expect from the beginning of this book) ends up being a hurricane that wrecks up the status quo - but, like a hurricane, leaves destruction and a world of hurt in her path. And it's Jamalee who's too easy to blame for the stupid, pointless tragedy that happens in this book - until you stop to think of the real cause of everything, the crushing oppressive poverty aided by addiction and small-town isolated-community mentality. And, just like in The Winter's Bone, the real character of this story is the setting itself, the Ozarks, the place that to my privileged middle-class educated self seems almost unreal and yet is the reality for so many people, the place that is not afraid to bite if you happen to cross it and it's code of conduct. And that is the most sobering thing in this book for me, really.Perhaps it's exactly the juxtaposition of humorous witty voice of Sammy-the-village-idiot and the crushingly cruel hopelessness of reality that make this book what it is and make my brain spin over it. I'm not sure, but I know I'm not likely to forget this story any time soon. 4 stars and a lasting shaken-up feeling."}, {"userName": "Paquita Maria Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez", "userReview": "Oh yeah, dude. Yes. I loved this little beast. I understand that Winter's Bone is Woodrell's show dog, but this shit is off the hook, which come to think of it is a terribly inappropriate pun that only people who have read this book already will understand, and I apologize for that and swear it was an accident considering I in no way think even fictional Hate Crimes are funny, but still. Damn. This book. This book is good. At very first, it reads a lot like Dylan's Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie type of stuff, all rhythm and rhyme windy down and out wisdom, as while the narrative voice establishes itself in its hillbilly poet style, you can almost picture Woodrell sitting in his seedy apartment snapping his fingers as he reads his own words back to himself, back in a time machine to whenever this novel was in its formative phase. As karen points out in her even-handed review, it is arguably a tad overwritten, sort of in the style of like Woodrell suddenly realized what he was capable of with a pen, and went all \"HOLY SHIT MOM, LOOK!\" show-off. Still. Still. I have been around a lot of country poke, and you would be surprised at the turns of phrase, the capacities for metaphor and street wisdom and almost gruelingly perceptive insight regarding inescapable doom that can be heard from the whiskey-slurry mouths of people who have known essentially nothing but desperation and adversity, and Woodrell sells it exceptionally well here. Desire is boiled down to bare necessities, to something as simple as this: \"I reckon I always had been huntin' for a place to plant my feet and go down swinging.\" But it is never that simple, and in this world, all you have to hold onto is the dim fantasy of some hypothetical wives' tale regarding you and the few cheap jabs you got in before you went down. That your name will be associated with more than a welfare record, that you will prove you meant something to the world by at the very least garnering a headstone in the end.It's strange when you read a book that is simultaneously so driven by prose, by things which can't be manifested in their absolute fruition except in the form of the written word, but is also so absolutely film-able, so cinematic, so full of, uhh \"cameratic\" possibilities. I've been wondering about this a lot lately with some of the newer literature I've been reading, and I think it's just a simple matter of some of the more gifted contemporary southern lit kings are not just filthy-poetic-touching-deep-down-spots-y, but are fucking phenomenal at convincing, sharp, insightful, funny, just real dialogue. Basically, I would love to see this filmed. Times a thousand.So tragic. So beautiful and evocative and dirty and fierce. Literary realism at some of its most fayuncy-finest.

Meet Sammy Barlach who's just hired on down at the dog food factory. It's Friday night. The Tequila and Meth have got Sammy flying, impressing new friends down at the bar. Wanting to fit in with the new gang, when one suggests Sammy burgle one of the town mansions, Sammy's up for it. But he hears the laughter of his new buddies and the roar of their pickup recede in the distance when they drop him off at his next crime scene.Sammy manages to get inside and stay awake just long enough to recognize that the rich live a Helluva lot better than he does. But the problem with Meth is that although it will keep you going for days, ultimately you crash and Sammy crashes in someone else's house. Not a good thing--his rap sheet shows he's in for some long time away at the State pen if he's caught.\n\nI fell deep down in there, until this bright light raised me from sleep. Coming out of a pit such as that, you think the bright light could be God or a cop on patrol;...then my eyes got right and it was just a candle held in front of my face by a girl in a black gown with jewelry twinkling here and there and a young fella in a tuxedo that swallowed him, smoking a heavy white pipe with a face design sculpted around the bowl.'Are you dangerous? the girl asked. 'You look dangerous.'...\"He just might do,\" the fella said. \"He's got that 'born to lose and lose violently' air about him. \"That's good.\"\n\nMeet Jamalee and Jason Merridew, brother and sister, pranksters, both of them. It isn't their house either. Jamalee and Jason learn how the other half lives by breaking into the homes of the wealthy and studying their possessions.Jamalee wants out of West Table bad. There's a better place outside West Table, outside the Ozarks. Jason is her ticket out of town. He's already a hair dresser in training down at Ramalee's Beauty Salon. He gave her that unique tomato red hair of hers, thank you very much. He's about the most gorgeous piece of man flesh in the county. All the ladies line up for Jason to shampoo their hair and purr with a contented smile on their faces while Jason's fingers massage their scalps.The way Jamalee sees things, all she needs to do is get Jason out of town, set him up in business, the hair dressing business and the gigoloin' business and life will be easy street. The only problem is Jason is gay and isn't too keen on being a gigolo. Jamalee knows it's not easy being gay in West Table. That's the reason Sammy might be the right man to provide security for them.When you get right down to the bottom of things though, at least around West Table, you are who you are based on where you're from. When you're the children of Bev Merridew the local prostitute a fellow can always count on when he's pinched in the crotch, and you live over in Venus Holler, the other half doesn't think you're much of anything.Well, Sammy has no family he'll speak of, and he decides to join the Merridews. Goodhearted Bev provides beer and sympathy when she's not on business which is just fine with Sammy.Jamalee, furthering her education, looks to take a job down at the Country Club as a server. Sammy and Jason accompany her to the club. There's not a chance in Hell Jamalee is going to get that job. She's Venus Holler trash. In revenge, Jamalee, Jason, and Sammy drive hogs over the Club's golf course during the night, ruining every hole. It's all whoopin' and hollerin' until the other half teach the folks at Venus Holler a lesson. One of the Merridews will die. Blood money will be paid. Those who live must decide the value of a human life. And Sammy Barlach will show you just how dangerous he can be.This is my third Woodrell read. Each has been a unique experience with narrators distinct and different in voice. There is humor here, at first light, but turning from comedy to tragedy. While Thomas Wolfe told us you can't go home again, Daniel Woodrell let's us know that sometimes it's impossible to leave it without a price too high to pay.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "She Can't Help But That She Born Among 'em; They's Ain\u2019t Nothin but Purr Po' White TrashDaniel Woodrell has pegged lower class whites, aka rednecks, hillbillies, hicks, bumpkins or \"Poor White Trash,\" and their character, vel non, the best I've read. Be these lowlifes in the South or in Southie, the same general senses, smell, sound, sight and feel apply, and Woodrell shows you all the goods. As in Winter's Bone, the female lead, whose hair here is dyed tomato red, has integrity and some sense of decorum about her, as well as hopes and wants (mostly to leave \"this place\"). Turns out a SouthShakespearean Tragedy.Woodrell doth have a wry and spritely humor about him though. 'Tis such fertile ground you're dealing with here, see. He describes the origins of the \"town\" of Venus Holler \"across the tracks,\" where most of the story takes place as: \"Venus Holler was the most low-life part of town.... Venus Holler as a name was one of those cruel country jokes that sticks.... The holler naturally lay across the tracks from ... West Table (MO)....

Told in the peculiar vernacular of Sammy Barlach, the novel relates the attempts of a pair of pretty but poor siblings who want nothing more than to get out of the shithole that is their hometown, West Table, Missouri. And lucky Sammy happens to be the itinerant loser that the ketchup-haired, redneck femme fatale Jamalee Merridew - the brains of the brother & sister combo - decides will be the ideal muscle to back her and her brother's threadbare quick-money scheme to get to their fantasy-land version of opulent, aristocratic Florida. Wise he may not be but Sammy ain't no dummy, as we leisurely learn through his grimly philosophic outlook on life; he knows there is no land of milk and honey awaiting the dreamers of the lower classes. A lonely brooder who hides away a vaguely revealed past of violence and heartbreak beneath a boozy, simple-natured exterior, Sammy's main attraction for the Merridew clan is their apparent acceptance of him, as beaten by life as he may be; and in return he comes to love not only icy Jamalee, but also her pragmatic prostitute of a mother and her gorgeous and sexually confused brother. What plays out is not a violent and action-packed crime novel, but instead a sadly ironic tragicomedy about the inability to change oneself for the better."}, {"userName": "RandomAnthony", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721021-randomanthony", "userReview": "Holy Bejesus, Tomato Red is good. Daniel Woodrell, the guy who wrote Winter's Bone, is moving up my \u201cfavorite writer\u201d charts. I've read two of his books and hope he's published 100 more. I'm salivating at the prospect.Tomato Red reads like Jim Thompson in the Ozarks but with Woodrell's superhuman tag-team of spellbinding language and cutting psychological insight. The story centers on Sammy Barlach, a well-intentioned loser who meets Jam and Jason Merridew while sleeping off a bender in a house he was burgling until he fell asleep. Sammy doesn't fit anywhere, has no people, and doesn't expect much from the world. Jam is a teenage girl obsessed with escaping the sunbleached trailer park hell of West Table, Missouri. Jason is the best looking guy in the county. The town's unwritten hegemony binds the three and places them in a position where gaining momentary self-respect requires a lashing out with spectacularly tragic consequences. Tomato Red proceeds from Sammy's internal dialogue. He figures out the best decision, when Jam invites him to hang out with the Merridews, is to head \u201cthe other way from you\u201d, but when Jam says Sammy can \u201cshare the stink\u201d, he sticks around because, as he puts it, \u201cI always have just wanted to fit in somewhere, and this is the bunch that would have me.\u201d Sammy functions as a wary, almost impassive observer, cognizant in an unspoken way of the \u201cshit hits fan\u201d inevitability. And he seems to watch his surroundings closely because they might the closest he might ever come to a calm, safe place. Until they're not. And when everything falls apart I felt a cleaved sense of \u201chow the fuck did that happen?\u201d and \u201chow the fuck would that not happen?\u201d Woodrell's taut, wiry novel runs a perfect 225 pages, not a wasted word among them.A couple weeks back Anthony Bourdain featured Woodrell on the No Reservations \u201cOzarks\u201d episode. Within two minutes Bourdain admits that Woodrell's presence in the Ozarks is the primary reason for the episode's existence. He wanted to meet Woodrell and manipulated the making of a television show to meet that goal. I get it, Mr. Bourdain. I'm right with you. I can't explain how Daniel Woodrell became a writer, and from where his gifts fell from the sky, but he's a manifestation of great American fiction from a blank spot on most readers' mental maps that's fortunate to claim a living storyteller of this caliber. His back catalog is calling me. Both Tomato Red and Daniel Woodrell are the real deal."}, {"userName": "Tfitoby", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454475-tfitoby", "userReview": "It's been labelled Country Noir but in reality Daniel Woodrell writes mouth watering literature in a noir mileau with a touch of the Thompson/Cain existentialism.Set in a small Ozark town, a setting familiar to you if you've already discovered the wonder that is Daniel Woodrell, Tomato Red is the story of Sammy, Bev, Jam and Jay; how they come together and how they dissipate, how they live and how they dream.Woodrell sets the scene with great effect from the off, filling your mind with descriptive passages that you could only dream about writing yourself. Interlacing the horror with the humour in this Ozark reality from the point of view of Sammy, a lonely man who has turned to crank and house breaking in an attempt to win friends and influence people, you are taken on a whirlwind journey that would not be out of place in a novel from John Steinbeck. And that is the real talent of Woodrell's early novel, disguising his important literary work in an easily accessible genre framework.The four main characters are all interesting and very well written, their differing approach towards life captured in the (what I can only assume to be) perfect and honest manner of their speach and behaviour. These are real people whose weaknesses and faults are painted in burned out neon but you can't help but feel affection towards them, the way they accept their failings and make them work for their own benefit.If you want an action packed plot, or even an acknowledged story arc you're probably best to stay away from this one. The narrative meanders around, letting you get to know the town and the people, watches relationships develop until you feel as though you too are a resident of Venus Holler and then it ends. These are my favourite kind of stories, ones without an obvious once upon a time beginning or the definitive closure that has come to be expected in Western fiction; this is a slice of Ozark life, it existed before you arrived and it will keep going long after you close the book for the final time."}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "Tomato Red has one of the best--and one of the longest--opening lines you'll ever read, and it sets the stage for a very good book that might best be categorized as Hillbilly Noir. Sammy Barlach, the narrator and main protagonist, is new to West Table, Missouri, and to his job at the dog food factory. Seeking company on a Friday night after work, he falls in with a \"coed circle of bums\" who are well supplied with tequila and crank. You know that from this point on interesting things are going to happen and that most of them won't be good. By the end of the evening Sammy finds himself in league with two ambitious kids, Jamalee Merridew, whose tomato red hair provides the book' title, and her beautiful brother Jason.Jamalee and Jason like to break into the homes of wealthy people, dress up in their clothes and imagine what it would be like to be rich. Jamalee has definite ambitions of becoming rich and concocts a plan wherein her brother will seduce local wealthy women and the pair will then blackmail them by threatening to expose their transgressions. The only problem with the plan is that Jason's sexual impulses run in a slightly different direction.The book's plot is a bit on the thin side, but Woodrell has captured beautifully the patterns of speech and the rhythms of life among the Ozarks less privileged residents. Another terriffic character is Jamalee and Jason's mother, a local prostitute with whom Sammy also becomes entangled. The story is alternately funny and heart-breaking and you can't help but root for these mostly lost souls, even though you know that at the end of a book like this things are probably not going to turn out well for anyone."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14987742-doug", "userReview": "At first, I didn't like this at all. I kept groaning at the bad grammar and inconsistent tense and I had a vision of Miss Crabtree from The Little Rascals rolling in her grave. Then, sort of like Barack Obama and his position on gay marriage, my feelings about this book slowly-then-quickly evolved. Praise Evolution! My feelings changed when I finally realized that the poor grammar and odd tense shifts as well as the disorienting style (especially in the beginning) are intentional. Doh! After all, the story is presented by a cranked up narrator in first person POV and what more would you expect from a meth head? In that respect, Woodrell's writing is actually pretty brilliant.Don't expect much of a story here. A murder mystery plot enters at about the halfway point, but it's not the focus of the novel and it doesn't resolve in the way murder mysteries usually do. With its angst-y mood and tone, this reminded me more of an expressionistic painting than a novel. I'm okay with that though. I just didn't expect it. Gay readers might balk at the somewhat stereotypical portrayal of the character of Jason (a \"country queer\" hairdresser who can't throw a decent punch), but I didn't. He's cast in a sympathetic light and all of the other characters (rednecks, pill-poppers and whores) are also semi-stereotypes. As long as everyone is treated equally, I'm a happy camper. Did I just come out the closet here on GR? Yay for me then. Sometimes I forget that that's a never-ending process.The deadpan humor typical of Noir had me laughing at some lines and groaning at others. These are some of the lines I especially liked: \"I \u2026 sweated like a beer bottle at a church picnic.\" \"Regular citizens from all the ages were all over the park. They were apparently celebrating some fun moment from history that I don\u2019t know about.\" \"\u2026staring toward the ceiling like she saw a weeping Jesus there invisible to all others.\" \"She kept her chin in the air and sent her body after it.\"\"Their talk was at that level of loud the too-drunk-to-notice favor.\"\"These old boys thumped their fat bellies proudly, with a kind of strange confidence, like all that fat was so much fat in the bank, fat they figured to retire on someday and live off.\"I especially like that last one. Some of Woodrell's writing is beautiful too, even when describing a less than beautiful scene. Here's just one example:\"This holler, at night or during the day, either one, had the shape of a collapsed big thing, something that had been running and running until it ran out of gas and flopped down exhausted exactly here. The houses were flung out along this deep crease in the hills and the crease surely did resemble the posture of a forlorn collapsed creature. Scrub timber and trash piles and vintage appliances spread down the slopes and all around the leaning houses to serve as a border between here and everything that wasn\u2019t here.\"By the end, I found myself truly admiring Woodrell's style and now I'm looking forward to reading his The Death of Sweet Mister with my \"On The Southern Literary Trail\" bookclub next month. I'm glad I got my feet wet with this one first.3.5 stars.

When he awakes he's confronted by two young people -- a man named Jason who's too beautiful to exist and a woman named Jamalee with hair \"a shade of red that would be natural on something growing in a garden but not on a person's head.\" Naturally, he nicknames this woman Tomato Red and uses clever phrases to describe the rest of her. Phrases concatenated to form sentences like, \"She sported lipstick that I'd call graveyard black, and her fingernails could've been dead-baby blue.\"Seems Jason and Jamalee live on the wrong side of the tracks in Venus Holler, which (as Sammy puts it) \"was the most low-life part of town, so I already knew where it was. ... I felt instantly at home.\" It's a place from which Jamalee would like to escape, taking Jason with her. And Sammy can tag along as their protection. (The first question Jamalee asks Sammy when he wakes up is, \"Are you dangerous?\" She makes it sound like an interview question, rather than a concern.)The threesome hang together, but all is not sweetness and light in their Ozarks setting. They run afoul of West Table, Mo., society's conventions. Doesn't help that Jamalee's mother, um, entertains men for a living. Entertains them at her house at all hours and in every possible manner.\u2028\u2028 Despite the patina of hope that keeps the threesome moving toward their goal of leaving the Holler, a situation arises that threatens their ambitions.\u2028\u2028Because, you know, mean streets can turn out to be gravelly roads that lead down into places like the Holler, as well as desolate coves. Places where people end up facedown dead in water unfit for swimming.\u2028\u2028And when you live on the wrong side of town, it don't matter whether that wrong side is in New York City or West Table, Mo. The justice for crimes committed against the poor is the same all over. Which is to say such justice can be illusive.\u2028\u2028 When faced with such a situation, those affected try to take matters into their own hands. Needless to say, this all leads to nothing good.\u2028\u2028Written in well-crafted prose imbued with genuine Ozarks sensibility, TOMATO RED stands out as great literature and thought-provoking noir.The book was reissued by Busted Flush Press in Sept. 2010."}, {"userName": "Kwoomac", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2076898-kwoomac", "userReview": "Wow, I'm not sure how he did this, but Woodrell was able to create characters in unlikable circumstances, but still have them be likable. The cast includes Sammy,a 24 year old drifter, who's been in and out of jail. Bev, the hooker and mother of two teens, who chooses not to protect her kids from the less savory details of her life. Jamalee, 18 year old daughter, who hates her mother a little too much and loves her brother a little too much. And Jason,17 year old beautiful boy, who's willing to prostitute himself, to bankroll his and Jamalee's escape from Venus Holler, Missouri. The story takes place in and around a trailor park in the Ozarks. The book was at times painful to read, as the characters are full of despair and self-hate and can't seem to get out of their own way. Sammy says, \"You see the inside of a classier world like that and it sets your own to spinning off-balance, and a tireless gnawing discontent gets to snacking on your guts and spirit. This caliber of a place makes you want to discriminate against yourself, basically, as it reveals you as such a loser.\" Jamalee, dreams of a better life, reads etiquette books aloud, and quizzes Sammy and Jason about different situations. It's heartbreaking. If this were a fairytale, one could imagine a happy ending, but it's not and in life as gritty as this, there are no happy endings. You gotta know things are just going to keep spiralling downward until it couldn't get any worse."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1730720-doug", "userReview": "The major mode of Tomato Red is impotence. Not so much the inability to change, but the inability to bring about what you want and need. There are flavors of cognitive dissonance here: of little country girls thinking they are big city, of eternal outsiders thinking they can find a place, of quiet gay men thinking there is a place for them in backwoods anywhere. Mostly, though, there is impotence. Inability. Big dreams, hopes. People better than where they were cast, at least in their mind's eye, but no real way to get another shot at redefinition.Sammy Barlach, a loser of an ex-con, find himself adrift with Jamalee and Jason Merridew. She, the Tomato Red of the title, is small and spry, unsettled in Venus Holler (to a small Ozarks town what slums might be to a bigger one) and looking to move on. Her beautiful younger brother Jason is both her partner and her keys to escape, simultaneously a reason to leave and a tool for her to use. Jam's and Jason's mom, Bev, a backwoods bohemian, cares little about any sort of change, and mostly just wants her continuously accruing past to stay in the dark, in the dust.It is a comical book, darkly so, at least for the first 2/3s. Then it becomes tragic in tone and stays that way. Most of the comedy is like most of the tragedy, an exercise of place and knowing your own or at least feeling it. It starts up a bit too goofy for its own good, with descriptions of wistful outlaws and redhaired waifs who break into expensive homes both, to a degree, to escape where they are. It takes a few chapters to get into a more solid mode, and by that time you might already have ideas about the book, but if you can free yourself up to see it in another light it is a rewarding read. Not as spare as it could be. Not as punchy. Not as honest. It is kind of short, but has plenty of story to keep you going. It has heart and it is willing to let you catch up, to get caught up.As the final few pages start rolling up, and you realize the bit pinched by your right hand is much smaller than the bit in your left, you might feel a moment of panic knowing it to be over so soon, but in reality, the whole thing was always destined to end sharp. We're not meant to live with Barlach and the Merridews. We're barely even visiting.You also have to realize, as you get into it, that you are not here to see a Hallmark Made-for-TV movie. This is not a book about people overcoming, but about people being. This is not to say that no steps are made, just that Woodrell is more than ready to abuse you of any notion that he is writing about heroes. He is writing about people, people who have life stacked against them, and it's kind of wonderful the way he does it. Just be forewarned."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "I was excited to read a book written by someone from Missouri. I lived in Missouri for... an annoyingly long time, and I hated the majority of that time. But I'm sure some good stuff came out of the state - if one of those things can be a good author, that's great. So I keep my eyes peeled.I heard a lot about Winter's Bone, and something about a movie based on it. A friend asked for the book last Christmas and I had no idea what she was talking about at that time because I sometimes live under a rock. Then it turns out my brother had a copy of this book, Tomato Red, which he let me borrow. And I'm now, like a year later, finally reading it. Yay me!It's an okay story, with okay characters, but quite honestly they're characters I feel like I already sort of know. Certainly that's the point, and every good writer should be able to write characters that the reader can relate to. But this was sort of frustrating for me to read, because I'm pretty sure I could pinpoint each character based on people I knew when I lived in Missouri. Yeah. I left Missouri for a reason.Still, it's a quick read, I liked the \"noir\" concept based in the Ozarks. I'll read more of this Woodrell guy because I think he has some skills. But I'll probably need to take some time between his books; the setting still hits too close to home sometimes."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108056-josh", "userReview": "Delusions of grandeur, broken hopes and faded dreams populate this pocket marked landscape where a person\u2019s status is symbolised by their street address and history accounts for their future. \u2018Tomato Red\u2019 is a tale of an unconventional grafter who finds heart by way of a homely trailer park family that encapsulate all the stigma tied to the white trailer park trash label they so gladly wear like a badge of honour. All that is, except for Jamalee, a whore\u2019s daughter and sister to an overtly handsome young man who only wants to be treated with some kindness and be met with non-judgemental cynicism. True noir in the same vein as Megan Abbott and greats like Thomson, Chandler and co. Woodrell\u2019s country noir stands up against any New York back alley, LA bar, or Chicago blues \u2013 small in stature but big on entertainment value for those who seek a kind of realism that reeks of injustice and depravity. Even the lawmen are unlawful, quick to turn a blind eye for the narrowly perceived greater good of the community \u2013 the community on the right side of the tracks, that is. \u2018Tomato Red\u2019 reads like a book set in the 50\u2019s, written in the golden age of noir, yet delivered in a modern way which showcases all the heart and soul of each dimly lit character to perfection.

In this particular book we meet Sammy; our POV character and a down and out redneck criminal; Jamalee, a white trash girl who wants to make a better life for herself and her brother; Jason, the aforementioned brother who is devastatingly beautiful and confusedly gay; and Bev, the mother of Jam and Jason, and who pays her bills through prostitution. All characters are full and well fleshed out. The dialog is excellent and the voice is just short of brilliant. There isn't much story here but the book doesn't suffer much for its lack.The main theme of the book seems to be the futility of trying to rise above one's station in life. That in America, people who are born poor and without means generally die poor and without means. While there are the occasional success stories, for the most part, they are mere drops from the vast ocean of futility and despair that greet the infant newly born to the \"wrong\" sort of people. With our Oligarchs currently chopping up the desiccated corpse of what used to be organized labor in the United States and draining the few remaining assets from the middle class, I don't expect things to be looking up anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun", "userReview": "2.5 starsAaaah...so what to say about this book. Well, it's probably good for what it is, a Kurt Vonnegut meets Erskine Caldwell with maybe a tincy-wincy echo of Raymond Chandler. The writing is competent, and there's a point. It's just not a style of writing that appeals to me...in fact, I find it a little annoying, but understand it's a personal preference kind of thing more than a reflection of the writer's talent.I debated between two and three stars, but ultimately decided on two because after reading his book Winter's Bone, I went in with high expectations and now feel cheated.I'm not sure whom to recommend this to, so will simply say that if you like writing that's kind of off-beat and loaded with tongue-in-cheek characters, then you might enjoy this. It's short and well-written, and probably why I kept reading, otherwise I think this is one that I might have abandoned by page 100.I'll add that many of my goodreads friends liked it, friends with whom I share reading interests. So who knows. This one just did nothing for me.

It's the one-liners, the never-too-anxious pacing, the tone, the perfect-pitch, and as if that's not enough, he laces it with humor.

From the foreword, and a good summation of the book: \"The noir trap is set...by a world that never gives these couples a chance - that only seeks to throw them away.

This is a book I should \"like\" based on the general genre, my admiration of the author, and the impact it had on other readers I greatly respect. Having previously returned it twice to the library after not being able to get it started within my allotted time, I was tickled it was selected as a monthly group read within the group \"On the Southern Literary Trail\"- surely the cue that it was meant to be for me to finally get it under my belt.Perfect setup.......for a book that I just couldn't quite like. I can't put my finger on it completely; just an \"OK\" story line which lacked the character buy-in I have discovered in other readings from his brain. In the same way the 90's show \"90210\" cheapened the probably somewhat truth of those kinds of kids, this one broached the issue of stereotypical low-bred Ozark foothill youth's coming of age. Almost a little \"soap opera\" in flavor for me. This author has skills, but for this reader I found them better displayed in more fleshed out plots of later works (The Death of Sweet Mister is equally \"nasty and scummy\" but for me had deeper tie in than this one).Woodrell's talent is clearly in there- squarely nailing the \"voice\" of these characters. He can write from a perspective that has you convinced he's \"one of them\". How else could you understand the intricate parts of these characters if you didn't spend your time drinkin 'splo wiskey by the gallon, hanging tight with prison tatted up crank heads, and going on week long drunken fishing trips that somehow devolve into either sexually or criminally minded escapes? Yet, to meet this author in person, is like spending time with quite the opposite. A gentle minded, introspective, soft spoken, well read pacifist. My fandom is in no way in jeopardy for this guy even though I got a less than perfect read out of this one."}, {"userName": "William Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1143572-william-thomas", "userReview": "I grew up around a whole heap of hillbilly boys straight out of the Tennessee hills. Grandmama picked cotton near her whole life. Grandpa died with fingers so gnarled from arthritis after pushing a plow for 50 years that he had to have his youngest boy hold roll and hold his cigarettes for him. My dad, well, he wasn't the hard-working type an let out for Las Vegas at age 17 and bounced from city to city his whole life. Always wound right back there in Ripley, TN though. Needed to be around his people. That's actually exactly how I know that Woodrell is as authentic as f&$@. Not for any of the language Megan Abbott laid out in the foreword, or any of the beautiful, plain-speech prose. Just one word authenticates the entire thing. The fact that Woodrell doesn't say family or friends. Doesn't ask \"are those your friends?\" Or \"where's your family?\" Nope. He uses the word 'people'. \"Where're your people from?\" Who's your people?\" Hillbilly credibility right there. I just reviewed 'Give Us a Kiss' a few days ago and thought it was just so damned awful after having heard so much high praise for Woodrell. So, since its bot like I don't own 859 other books that need to be read, I started Tomato Red immediately after putting down GUaK. Best decision I could have made, by far. This is what I was expecting from the man who is supposed to be the precursor of Bill Frank and Donald Ray Pollock. A damned beautiful, savage and fatalistic masterpiece of backwoods crime drama. It's hardboiled as hell. We can trace Woodrell back to Jim Thompson if we want to see where his literary people came from. It's mean and there just ain't no way around any of the meanness. The essence of hardboiled pulp is the fatalism. This has it in spades. There isn't much to say about it except that it demands to be read. It's a classic of American literature, a southern gothic that tells the story of a part of this country that Jonathan Franzen and Jeffrey Eugenides sure as hell ain't gonna write about. Pick it up. Fly through it. Ain't that long. Goes by real fast. But it'll stick with you for a long damn time.
