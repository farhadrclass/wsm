The premise of a universal Feast, the feast of life that dates back to a time before the Romans was a fascinating one, but it got lost in the welter of detail about the many more mundane feasts of a great house in the seventeenth century. The everyday story, of John\u2019s slow rise from scullery boy to head cook and his unrequited love for the spoiled and wilful lady of the house was slow to unfold, but quietly fascinating. For a while, I became completely enveloped in the gentle pace of these lives, lived by the seasons and the days of feast and fast. But the pacing is odd. It starts out very slow, with John\u2019s early life, as he learns to read, learns of meadow herbs and seasonings and how to cook - from his mother and from a near-sacred book, learning about \u2018The Feast\u2019. There\u2019s an almost aching attention to detail, but so beautifully described that the lack of a solid story hardly seems to matter. This slow pace continues as John leaves his home to learn how to cook in the kitchens of the great house where his mother learned her art, then everything suddenly speeds up as we race through the Civil War and John leaves to fight for the king, then hits breakneck speed; John leaves the house for \u2013 who knows where? His years away are omitted completely. And then he returns for something of a predictable end. Maybe the pace is meant to reflect the times? The daily round for the people in those days must have been as predictable, as un-changing as the seasons and holy calendar that confined and consumed their lives. The sudden advent of war \u2013 and such a cruel war, bringing with it unimaginable destruction, undreamed of change \u2013 must have come like a bolt of cruel lightning, burning everything ever-known and replacing it with harsh religion and cold misery. If this was Lawrence Norfolk\u2019s intention, I have to say, I don\u2019t truly think it works. I personally loved the slow un-folding of the pre-war chapters with all their fine-worked details, the sudden change of pace and omitting of important chapters in his protagonist\u2019s life was just confusing. For all its fine-crafted beauty, there is something empty at the heart of this book. There\u2019s a wealth of detail about the things that go on, but very little depth of feeling because the characters never really came alive - and there are some marvellous characters: the childhood sweetheart subsumed into the church, the manic puritan priest, the foppish wastrel suitor, and Heron Boy! Who was heron boy? Where did he come from, what was his story? I would have loved to know. All of the characters could have been magnificent, but none of them came fully fleshed, they all seemed devices to hang the story and the details on. John Saturnall was the most nebulous of all, he seemed somehow colourless and ghostly; at times I felt I could see right through him. So much happens to this man, but there\u2019s never any sense of anticipation, of wondering or conjecturing what might happen next, because he never felt like a real man to me and so nothing he said or did could move me. And after all my moaning, you\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019ve given this book 4 stars. Three stars would simply not do it justice; there\u2019s a beauty in the language and a depth of intricate detail that\u2019s astonishing and lovely. I did enjoy it very much, but couldn\u2019t love it."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "\u201cKings raise their Statues and Churchmen build Cathedrals.

John is the child of a woman who is a sort of outcast; an herbalist and midwife, she lives on the outskirts of the village and doesn\u2019t go to church. Of course this means she is thought of as a witch. When a plague runs through the village, she is blamed and they are run out of town. They take up living in a deserted house in the woods, living on late season fruit and chestnuts. She is dying, of both starvation and disease, but before she dies, she teaches John to read from a book about a strange feast held in Buccla\u2019s Wood. It encompasses every form of food; fish, fowl, vegetables, sweets, mammals are all included, and the feast is for everyone, not just the rich as is the way of the land at the time. At her wish, after her death, he is taken to Buckland Manor where he is put to work in the vast kitchens. John\u2019s life changes totally. Used to being alone or with only a couple of people, he is now constantly pressed by people on all sides. He works every minute of the long day and falls directly into a sleep that never seems to be long enough. Still, given the time and place, it\u2019s a good situation. Food is abundant here, he\u2019s living inside, and after awhile he gets to learn cooking. He\u2019s in a better place than a lot of people.This is primarily a love story; a love that crosses classes and is forbidden- preserving estates and titles takes precedence over love. It\u2019s also an adventure story; the kitchen staff marched with the lord of the manor when he went to war supporting King Charles, and they were expected to fight with the soldiers. I liked the characters. They are not likable all the time; they do stupid, human, things sometimes. But, in the end, it\u2019s a story about food. We might think that cooking back in those days was fairly primitive, but it wasn\u2019t. It was actually very sophisticated. One of the culinary trends back then was to create dishes that looked like something else \u2013 parts of animals and birds sewn together to create a mythical beast, meat in pastry to look like a bird, sugar creations in the shape of just about anything. Cooks vied to create the most elaborate and surprising dishes- a sort of Iron Chef, Stuarts edition. Most of the year, the diet was rich and varied; the manor supplied fish from its own ponds, poultry, eggs, dairy products, pork, honey, wheat, fruit and vegetables (they did eat their \u2018sallets\u2019) and much was stored for winter. A stable trade system meant the upper classes enjoyed sugar and spices. The sheer amount of person power it took to feed a manor was incredible- most workers were specialists, turning the spits in the kitchen, washing the endless stream of dirty dishes, plucking fowl, managing the fish ponds, the dove cote, the hen houses, the spice room, making the salads, cutting up the meat\u2026 and all those people had to be fed, too. You can see how a book can be created around a kitchen of the era! The food, and John\u2019s relationship to it and how he uses it to speak to the lady of the manor, is lovingly detailed, much more so, really, than the people.Food was not always plentiful, however. It was easy to starve back then. The stark difference between the incredible plenty of the start of the story versus what they have to deal with when the Roundhead soldiers steal the food from the manor and destroy what they cannot take shows how dramatically life can change. John falls back on how he and his mother lived in the woods, and on what he learned from the book of the Feast. He is the hero of the tale, for all the people living on the manor. What the Feast was is never made clear. It\u2019s like a myth of a Golden Age, when all were equals and food was plentiful. Was it a pagan community that had existed in the woods before Christians arrived? Was it a myth to comfort the reader, a dream to hold onto? Did it have a direct bearing on John\u2019s ancestors? Was the book a semi-magical teaching aid that allowed John to excel in the manor kitchens later? In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter. It allowed John to hold on and to save the manor. \u2018John Saturnall\u2019s Feast\u2019 is a story of cycles and renewals, both earthly as the wheel of the year turns and spiritually, as human hope and happiness comes up again and again."}, {"userName": "Liviu", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu", "userReview": "Since his very notable debut some 20 years ago with Lempriere's Dictionary, Mr. Norfolk has written only one another major novel, Pope's Rhinoceros which was what I expected and more - I read it only twice across the years, but I am rereading it too now starting when I heard a few days ago about his upcoming new novel, this one, John Saturnall's Feast; as for Lempriere, maybe this time (it's at least my 10th try at it) I will manage to get into it...Anyway, I saw the upcoming John Saturnall's Feast a few days ago on Net Galley and I obtained a review copy which I expected to take me a while to read (see above why, noting that Pope's Rhinoceros is also a pretty dense and almost 700 pages long though quite a rewarding novel that makes one understand life in Europe ~1520's better than many historical treatises, such is its superb atmosphere and the powerful style of the author).To my surprise I almost breezed through John Saturnall's Feast as it was very hard to put down, but also it stood at about \"only\" 400 pages and was written in a much more accessible style - a pretty straight forward and more or less chronological narrative interspersed by fanciful \"feast recipes\" according to particular events of importance in the book. Actually, the style is almost sensuous in a way, though the grime and harsh realities of England from around 1630's till 1662 (with an epilogue set a decade or so later) are very much in evidence also. The book is clearly John's story and the blurb is generally accurate, but despite that the main hero is only a \"cook\" rather than a knight or such, there is adventure, heroism, seduction, battles, fanatics... The novel is also very visual - I was picturing quite a lot of it as a Peter Greenaway movie, more precisely the mixture of the period of Draughtsman's Contract and the feasting of The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover - both movies I've watched a number of times...Though now the cook is the lover too and he does not end on the dinner table...Anyway a highly, highly recommended novel and a top 25 of mine for this year, while i expect I will reread it quite a few times to enjoy its atmosphere...I also expect this one to appear on this year Booker prize longlist at the least."}, {"userName": "Issicratea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23268828-issicratea", "userReview": "The merits of this book first. It really is quite evocative in its descriptions of a cornucopian, heavily populated seventeenth-century kitchen. A lot of research has gone into this, but you don't get the 'dead hand of research effect' so common in historical novels: the details of food preparation, ingredients, recipes, arcane kitchen roles and duties are brought together in a convincing and imaginatively compelling brew (it's impossible to avoid food metaphors talking about this book). I felt that this was probably the heart of the author's vision for the book, and he brings it off superbly.The problem for me was that this frankly isn't enough to make a novel, or not a novel of this conventional kind, anyway. A plot is needed. Norfolk does supply us with one, of a fairly conventional ilk (protagonist emerges from hideous childhood bearing the odd scar; love triumphs across class barriers; the undeserving get their dues; the deserving live happily ever after) but it's all fairly formulaic and not especially engaging. I never at any point reading this novel felt a strong desire to find out what happened next, which has to be a bad sign.The characterization is especially weak. There are a lot of characters, but quite large numbers of them, especially in the Fremantle household in which the bulk of the novel is set, never really establish themselves as anything more than names. Of the more worked-up characters, none struck me as especially memorable. Lucretia is particularly underdeveloped, in a way that is problematic for the whole romantic element. She seems to me entirely a cipher, doing exactly what is needed for the plot at any given moment, but without any coherent character that I could discern. Some elements of her story are simply laughable, such as the supposed climactic moment near the end where she deliberately masquerades as a whorish seductress in order to put Saturnall off her and hence spare his feelings (at least, I think that's supposed to be what happens ... I must say I had rather given up on the novel by that point).The villains are also a weak point: Clough, Marpot, Piers Callock. I didn't think anyone did completely unregenerate 'baddies', without a hint of redemptive complexity any more - or at least not three of them in a single novel. Frankly, they are clich\u00e9s. Marpot is even given the arch-villainous characteristic of 'cold blue eyes' at one point, just in case we were in any doubt of his general iniquity.I found it interesting that Nofolk's endnote spoke of the book having had a 'long and strange' route to publication, and wonder whether the very mixed quality of the resulting work has anything to do with that. It IS genuinely mixed - there are some very good things amid the less good, as I said. To be honest, though, I wouldn't say the language or the evocation of seventeenth century life were any stronger at their best than what is found in Maria McCann's As Meat Loves Salt, for example, and I found that a far superior novel to this in terms of character and plot. The Civil War background is also better exploited in McCann. It seemed rather perfunctory here."}, {"userName": "Kate Mayfield", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613390-kate-mayfield", "userReview": "Lawrence Norfolk's elegantly written JOHN SATURNALL'S FEAST is utterlycaptivating.

I love it when I become so engrossed in a story that I feel I am right there with the characters and Norfolk does a wonderful job of bringing this story to life.Each chapter begins with a recipe written by John that he prepared for the feasts. They were fun to read and the descriptions of the food prepared throughout the book were some of the best I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books about food. It was interesting to read about how the kitchens were run in a large manor and all of the different jobs there were to do. The other part of the book I enjoyed was the love story between John and Lady Lucretia. Both characters were strong and likable and they had lots of chemistry together which made the book all the more enjoyable. This is a great book for any historical fiction fan.

Kurzweilig, detailverliebt, spannend. Wie erwartet, handelt es sich um einen historischen Roman. Die Hauptfigur John w\u00e4chst in einem kleinen, abgelegenen und furchtbar \u00e4rmlichen Dorf im Norden Wales in der ersten H\u00e4lfte des 17. Jahrhunderts allein mit seiner Mutter auf. Susan ist die Kr\u00e4uterkundige und Hebamme des Dorfes. Sie wird solange akzeptiert, bis ein religi\u00f6ser Eiferer das Dorf nach einer Epidemie gegen sie aufwiegelt und sie in die W\u00e4lder vertreibt. Erst jetzt wird das Hauptthema deutlich: Auf der Flucht erf\u00e4hrt John von seinem spirituellen Erbe. \"Das Festmahl\" ist eine heidnisch-g\u00e4lische Vorstellung, deren Geheimnis John auf Anweisung seiner Mutter nachgeht. Die Suche nach seiner Identit\u00e4t verwickelt ihn in den englischen B\u00fcrgerkrieg, eine nicht standesgem\u00e4\u00dfe Liebe und in die Intrigen und K\u00fcnste, die eine herrschaftliche K\u00fcche der Zeit zu bieten hatte. \"Das Festmahl des John Saturnall\" ist damit eher ein Entwicklungsroman, in dem die historischen Ereignisse als Hintergrund f\u00fcr die innere und \u00e4u\u00dfere Entwicklung des Helden dienen. Zu meinem Lesevergn\u00fcgen hat beigetragen, dass John ein \u00fcberaus sympathischer Protagonist ist, neugierig, engagiert, loyal, empathisch, ein bisschen hitzk\u00f6pfig, dem ich auf seinem abenteuerlichen Weg gerne gefolgt bin. Norfolk gelingt es, sowohl das \u00e4rmliche Tal von Buckland als auch dessen Herrenhaus und seine Bewohner so lebendig zu beschreiben, dass man es gar nicht verlassen m\u00f6chte.

John Saturnall's Feast, while being a fabulous story (and one that had me drooling), carries the honor of being a historical novel and as such, will get a little more leeway from me.So what is that controversial subject? It's rape, folks. It happens in books, I get it. My issue is when it happens and we're supposed to just forget about it and move on, much like the women characters who experience it in the books. Now, I know in the time period this book is set in, rape happens. It happened then, and I know for sure those women then did not have the resources and information we have today about it's lasting effect. They were just affected, and then they moved on. So this paragraph is all I'll say on the subject. I wish Lawrence Norfolk had given Lucretia a bit more respect and had her maybe, I dunno, wait a little while longer to move forward on any sort of physical relationship, but that's my modern sensibilities kicking in.As for the rest of the book? It was fantastic. Each chapter began with 17th century (I believe?) writing about the preparation of a feast. People, I didn't know half of the ingredients as they were being described, but my mouth was watering. And then there came whatever gelatin concoction John made - it sounded MAGNIFICENT. And it was probably something gross like old ladies marshmallow salad at church pot lucks. But anyway, the description of the food was amazing and I was so caught up in the happenings and the vivid images that I could see everything coming to life.I think this would be a fabulous book club read.

The novel builds up slowly, and it took me a while to get caught up in the story, but when I finally did, it was a sensory, aesthetic feast that awaited me, intoxicating the senses but also giving me an insight into the time before and surrounding the Restoration in England.Occasionally, it read a bit like a young adult novel (overcoming small obstacles and conquering enemies, making new friends, falling in love for the first time), although never in a superficial, na\u00efve kind of way but rather as befits a historical novel of literary rather than popular leanings.I\u2019ve read that one\u2019s vocabulary is challenged/expanded when reading Norfolk, but that isn\u2019t so much the case in this book given that the main character, whom we follow throughout the book, is only 11 when we first meet him, and he becomes an adult only towards the end. This was a good choice, however. I really got to like John Saturnall. (And it\u2019s not quite true about the vocabulary in this book: There is an immense amount of words to do with medieval food that I\u2019d never heard of before. And when, in a friend\u2019s Danish translation of the book, bukkenade becomes bukkenade, camelade becomes camelade, I\u2019m really none the wiser).I might have liked some more introspection on the part of the characters, so the four-star rating is for the aesthetic feel of the story, for the world in the kitchen, for John Saturnall and for the Heron Boy."}, {"userName": "Elvina Barclay", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3100950-elvina-barclay", "userReview": "Reading that this book was about food and history I was intrigued have a copy to read.

For the cover and overall packaging alone I'd give this a five-star rating. Alas, you should never judge a book by its cover. Lol. I'm not saying this is not a good book. It is. I liked that it was ambitious in a way that it talked about religion and that it's a historical fiction but I thought it had a weak ending. I suppose it was my fault because the plot and the blurb (and the cover!!!) was so promising I expected way too much from it. Especially when John's mother said ... \"there's more.\" I waited (!!!) for that more! Lol. John and Lucy's love story dragged too. I get the whole it's a family thing but ... Yeah. Haha! I also thought there were too many characters here and I can understand the part that the story ran for years but some were probably unnecessary? Overall, the book had a good start ... and that was it. The most I can give this is a 3.5."}, {"userName": "Tuck", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565487-tuck", "userReview": "despite some predictable romancey stuff, there is enough surprises, grit, and historical atmosphere that i just loved this book. i coulda swore i already did this review once. i think gr;s is eating my reviews. anyway, can you imagine washing the dishes in a huge castle kitchen in 1620? it werent pretty."}, {"userName": "Kiki", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/612857-kiki", "userReview": "This was an electronic advanced reader copy from NetGalley.I have never read anything by this author before, but asked for the ARC based on the book's description on NetGalley and I received it. It wasn't until I was more than half way through the book that I decided to look up Lawrence Norfolk and learn a little bit more about this writer, and was impressed with his credentials, although I can hardly claim to have a strong interest in reading his other works, as they sound way above what I would be capable of reading and understanding! I was happy I was reading this on my Kindle, since I did use the built in dictionary quite a lot. Norfolk uses a lot of vocabulary you do not generally hear in today's world, most of it referring to more ancient times. This book is set in the 1600's in England, beginning right before the English Civil War. But another added feature of this novel is the ancient language used before each section to describe the \"receipts\" used for John Saturnall's Feast, essentially, a cookbook.John Sandall is a lonely little boy who lives with his mother, Shunned by the villages children as a \"witch's son,\" his mother is an herbalist/healer/midwife who is regarded as a w itch by the Puritanical order that has grown up in England after the Reformation and is trying to take over the worship in small villages. The Puritans in the village are fanatical and frightening, and the preacher, Marpot, is a hateful and controlling man who incites the village to violence against John and his mother, even after they have finally been accepted there. John and his mother are forced to flee, while their home is destroyed. They escape the wilderness nearby, surviving on their wits, and his mother continues to educate John to her ways with a special cookbook of sorts that she has managed to save.A very basic knowledge of the history of England is helpful when reading this book, and I often found myself looking up names and events to learn more about the period, people and places, but Norfolk purposely leaves much of the information provided in the story very vague, almost as if it really doesn't matter, and truthfully, the main characters are the most important ones to try and understand. John ends up at nearby Buckland Manor, as an orphan, but because of his uncanny culinary skills, he is allowed to stay on as a Kitchen Boy, instead of being sent to the poorhouse. There he meets Lady Lucretia, the motherless child of the manor, who often fasts in a passive rebellion against her father. He also meets a whole host of other interesting and important folks that contribute to life at the manor.This book has quite a complicated plot, and the reader really needs to pay attention to names of places, to the many characters and to the thoughts of the John and Lucy. The writing is extraordinary and the story is quite moving. I loved the way the author manages to keep things happening without becoming stagnant, or stuck in the many plot details, the book has a very natural flow and feeling, and without that, it would be very easy to become mired down by this novel. The last book I read with a plot this complicated was David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, which I really enjoyed, and the style of writing is similar: many clues and hints are given to the reader from the very start of the novel, and it is usually with hindsight that the reader suddenly recognizes them. A delightful book, challenging yet fun reading, especially for those who enjoy history and esoteric stories with amazing people, both real and fictional."}, {"userName": "Marina", "userReviewDate":

sin duda una larga espera para uno de los escritores con los que m\u00e1s he disfrutado. Ah\u00ed est\u00e1 \u2018El diccionario de Lempri\u00e8re\u2019, una de mis novelas favoritas, que recomiendo encarecidamente.\u2018El fest\u00edn de John Saturnall\u2019 es la cuarta y esperad\u00edsima novela de este autor brit\u00e1nico. Es la historia de la lucha personal de un joven por abrirse camino en un mundo que se lo hab\u00eda puesto todo en contra. Pero tambi\u00e9n una historia de un amor lleno de dificultades. La historia transcurre en Inglaterra, en el siglo XVII, y el protagonista es John Saturnall, un cocinero que tuvo que huir junto con su madre, acusada de brujer\u00eda. Entre las pertenencias m\u00e1s preciadas de su madre, se encuentra un libro que narra la historia de un antiguo fest\u00edn mantenido en secreto durante generaciones. La trama se complicar\u00e1 cuando John llegu\u00e9 a Bucland Manor, la residencia de Sir William Fremantle, y de su hija Lady Lucretia. Resulta interesante que una novela hist\u00f3rica no tenga por protagonista a un soldado o tenga por escenario un ambiente de intrigas palaciegas. El mundo culinario est\u00e1 muy presente y realmente parece que est\u00e9s entre fogones, utensilios y viandas. Como es habitual, Norfolk se ha documentado exhaustivamente y sabe transmitir con naturalidad todo tipo de gastronom\u00eda, de tal manera que a veces es inevitable salivar en seg\u00fan qu\u00e9 plato. El conflicto b\u00e9lico, pol\u00edtico y religioso iniciado por Oliver Cromwell, en esta \u00e9poca tan convulsa, donde primaban la venganza y las persecuciones, tambi\u00e9n tienen un papel importante en la trama.Tengo sentimientos encontrados con esta nueva y esperada novela de Lawrence Norfolk. Hay momentos muy brillantes, pero el inicio se hace un tanto mon\u00f3tono, y el argumento sufre de continuos altibajos. Se nota que la cocina es importante en la trama, porque, como los buenos platos, esta se prepara a fuego lento. De igual manera, la novela no tiene la brillantez de los primeros dos libros, donde el ingenio, la imaginaci\u00f3n, la erudici\u00f3n y la estructura eran inigualables. Sin ser una obra excepcional, s\u00ed creo que es una novela que merece la pena ser le\u00edda."}, {"userName": "Lara (Bookishsolace)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53395520-lara-bookishsolace", "userReview": "Now this book is something! I\u2019ve never read such a book in my life before, but I honestly didn\u2019t get it at first. The first 100 pages are very confusing in my opinion but then suddenly everything becomes clear and I began to enjoy this book so much! The book may not be for everyone because it\u2019s such a descriptive novel that some may find it boring. I however loved the long passages dedicated to every single aspect of cooking and it somehow felt so real that I got really hungry and also was able to smell the dishes.John Saturnall is an Englishman in the 17th century who starts from being nothing to become a chef who even cooks for kings. He grows up in a small and highly superstitious village where he is ridiculed because the villagers believe his mum to be a witch. One night the flee their home and his mother tries to teach him the secrets of an ancient feast which not only involves the mythology and recipes but also teaching him the advanced skills to keep the feast alive. Suddenly his mother dies and he goes to Buckland Manor, the house of Sir William Fremantle and his beautiful daughter Lucretia. There he moves up the ranks of the kitchen and slowly discovers why his mother send him here. This part of the novel is rich in imagery and detail and shows how food is a physically built work of art. But then the English Reformation begins and war breaks out. John then follows the Lord of the Manor into battle and witnesses the massacres of the war. Poorer than ever he returns to BUckland Manor where he and a few other residents try to survive the years until the Restoration.This book has romance, war, mouthwatering dishes, adventures, mystery and gorgeous drawings of recipes at the beginning of each chapter.

And even better, historical fiction about food which obviously I'll love... I especially liked the receipts/extects from Saturnall's book at the beginning of chapters, one thing I'd never really considered before was not having thermometers, or even ovens with temperature settings, so descriptions of heating something until it 'shivers' or even 'so you can touch it but only for a second' (obviously I'm paraphrasing, I don't have my copy with me atm...). Also interesting/useful for further reading were the acknowledgements in the back, apparently Taste: The Story of Britain Through Its Cooking was a big inspiration, plus Norfolk lists several 17th century recipe books.The only thing I wasn't totally in love with was the sort of mythology/folk tale weaving through the story, it never seemed that convincing to me and then suddenly the entire story hinges around it. But that doesn't ruin the rest of the story."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10202935-brooke", "userReview": "I was so looking forward to reading this after getting a galley at Book Expo America. I hate to say it, but this was 400+ pages of cliches. I found John Saturnall and his mother's story interesting enough (particularly the way it was told--in series, mixed with episodes of his journey to his new home), but that was the highlight for me. Then this turned into another book where a servant falls in love with his mistress, boy saves girl from attempted rape, girl has his baby although she's marrying someone of her status that her father has chosen for her, girl marries said jerk because her father wants to keep his manor in the family and she can't inherit...the list goes on. I did enjoy the 17th century-style \"recipes,\" although it might have been more interesting to read the author's source material. I hate giving bad reviews, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.

It follows much of the life of John Saturnall from being cast out of his village with his mother for witchcraft to rising to Master Cook of a noble household. All set to the backdrop of the English Civil War between Charles I and Parliament. The plot and characterization are often simplistic and the author never really follows through on some ideas. On the other hand I thought Norfolk was quite restrained with certain aspects of the story such as the political background. The Civil War, religious fanaticism, even the romance are more sub-plots that have an impact on the main character's life. The major focus is on the character being a cook. Here the author is restrained as well so the reader doesn't get overwhelmed with recipes and the like so you don't need to be a food aficionado to enjoy it. To take inspiration from the title, the best way to read this book is to sit back and enjoy the feast."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21868582-paul", "userReview": "A rare DNF for me.

I think the book was poorly edited however as sometimes the sentences don\u2019t quite flow and allusions to things are a bit too loose meaning you have to re-read quite a few times in order to try and guess what is going on.Also, the 10 years or so of the commonwealth brushed over quite a lot and the end felt a bit rushed, considering the build up a depth of the previous chapters. STILL an enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56491386-kirsty", "userReview": "The novel begins in 1625 where, in the remote English village of Buckland, John Sandall and his mother Susan are fleeing from a vicious mob, who taunt the pair with cries of witchcraft: \u2018John, John, the Witch\u2019s Son!/Duck him and prick him and make him run\u2019. Their escape is fraught with danger and rather frightening for eleven-year-old John, particularly with elements such as \u2018the long grass whipping their legs as they scrambled for the safety of the slopes\u2019.His mother, Susan, is a Goodwoman, a midwife who concocts remedies for pregnant women and delivers the village\u2019s \u2018wailing infant\u2019 population. She knows that her son is targeted because of her profession, and treats this matter-of-factly at first, asking John \u2018They beat you again, didn\u2019t they?\u2019, and dismissing their actions as \u2018just their sport\u2019. Susan is not a likeable character, and whilst we feel sympathy for John having to live and work alongside her, the reader feels a great relief on behalf of the protagonist when she passes away.The main theme running through John Saturnalia\u2019s Feast is an ancient book, \u2018The Book of John Saturnall\u2019, which John\u2019s mother treasures. This book, she explains to her son, has \u2018a garden\u2019 on every page, and \u2018every fruit [grows] there\u2019. With the aid of this book, John is taught how to read and takes many of the ancient recipes which it includes to heart, memorising their ingredients and methods. Susan tells him on her deathbed that \u2018every true cook carries a feast inside him\u2019, and John promises her that he will keep the family\u2019s age old tradition of \u2018the Feast\u2019 alive. In his newly-orphaned state, he is sent to stay at Buckland Manor with Lord William Fremantle, where he is employed as a kitchen hand.Norfolk has used the third person narrative perspective throughout. At first, he captures the sense of place wonderfully, as well as the torment which John undergoes from his peers. Norfolk creates such sympathy for his protagonist in the first section of the novel, and his portrayal of the bullying actions carried out by his peers has been incredibly well executed. The simplistic phrases which the author uses are often the most harrowing \u2013 \u2018today the gibbet was bare\u2019 creating rather a sinister image, for example. The importance of the world around John is where the best descriptions are found, ranging from \u2018clover petals yielded honey bees\u2019 and \u2018sweet blackberries swelled behind palisades of finger-pricking thorns\u2019, to \u2018a great house seemed to break through the verdure and stretch two wings like a vast stone bird struggling free of the earth. Tiers of windows rose to a bristling plateau\u2026 [and] little towers jostled with cupolas and spires or dropped to invisible courtyards\u2019. A wealth of imagery is built up with such phrases and John\u2019s world becomes real on the page, if only for a little while.The novel is split into different sections, each of which features an intriguing and old fashioned title pertaining to the recipe featured at the beginning of every new part: \u2018A Foam of Forcemeats\u2019, \u2018A Broth of Lampreys\u2019 and \u2018A Dish of Candied Baubles\u2019, for example. The first section is excellent \u2013 well paced, with wonderful descriptions and a good evocation of the historical setting \u2013 but this changes as soon as the second section of the book is reached. Too many characters fill the novel\u2019s pages, and it is often a little difficult to keep track of who is who, what is happening and why. Some of the character names used also do not seem to fit with the period \u2013 Gemma and Maggie, for example; a small niggle, but an important one when writing an historical piece of fiction.The book itself has been wonderfully presented, with beautiful woodcuts and the inclusion of several old recipes dating from the time in which the book is set. John Saturnalia\u2019s Feast has been well researched and a good list of sources has been mentioned in the novel\u2019s acknowledgements. Whilst the novel is rather rich in its scope and multi-layered storyline, it is in the first 65 pages of the book where the strengths lie. The reader is drawn into John\u2019s world and feels so much for the protagonist, and this is then cruelly wrenched away when the second part of the novel begins. There is no real sense of consistency throughout, and whilst the pace of the book is wonderful at first, this has not been realised in the novel\u2019s remainder. All sense of the novel\u2019s flow disappears, the characterisation becomes rather slack at points, and John becomes rather a stolid character, whom less and less compassion is felt for as the novel reaches its end."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5870323-monica", "userReview": "\u201cNorfolk, the author of ornate period novels, here uses his talent for detail to evoke the life of a cook at a seventeenth-century British manor. . . . Norfolk creates a Manichaean struggle between Christian and pagan traditions, but this is ultimately less rewarding than the completeness of the physical world he describes.\u201d\u2014The New Yorker\u201cLawrence Norfolk, historical novelist extraordinaire, inhabits the 17th century through its food. From the reign of Charles I through civil war, Cromwell's protectorate and on to the restoration, we are treated to both lavish feasting and battlefield foraging, the politics of the high table and the hearthside use of medicinal herbs. . . . Norfolk's ability to fold history in on itself, and to summon deep time, is as dazzling here as it was in his earlier novels: family genealogy becomes a myth of origins. . . . The material is fascinating. . . . Norfolk's imagination is bigger and more abstract than the individual; he conjures so well the bustling bureaucracy of the 17th-century manor house, its systems of rights and obligations, its geographical and social significance. . . . The food writing is sensuous and exact. . . . You put the book down wanting to make it all.\u201d\u2014The GuardianThere's a mythic quality to Lawrence Norfolk's fourth historical novel. . . . it skillfully entangles folklore and foodlore. . . . Throughout the novel, food is shown to be both a source of sustenance and a thing of ritual; recipes are legacies, the threads connecting generations. . . . Norfolk's writing is at its strongest when he's describing the symbolic significance of certain dishes: spiced wine, delicate curls of spun sugar, slivers of almonds, and the flaking flesh of river fish.\u201d\u2014The Observer (UK)\u201cNorfolk knows how to make words roll around the mouth. . . . Fantastical architecture and weird botany are a vivid background to the bloody conflict and swooning romance. Norfolk is an expert on obscure sources as well as sauces. His blend of horrid history and oddly credible fantasy deserves to be consumed by the masses.\u201d\u2014Sunday TelegraphI could not have said any of this better myself.Norfolk's books so brilliantly realize strange times in other places - there is nothing else quite like them. This one is approachable, gripping (only if you like food, conflict and love stories) and a really beautifully made book on so many levels."}, {"userName": "Anna Janelle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9928631-anna-janelle", "userReview": "[image error]"}], "description": "A beautiful, rich and sensuous historical novel, John Saturnall's Feast tells the story of a young orphan who becomes a kitchen boy at a manor house, and rises through the ranks to become the greatest Cook of his generation.
