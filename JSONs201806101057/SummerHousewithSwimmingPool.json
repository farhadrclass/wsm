All the main characters are deeply flawed so the identification is not with them as people but in what they say, the universal truths ones we don't usually think of let alone express in words.

He says \"a naked body in a doctor's office is something different from a naked body out of doors\"....There was a section in this story where 'Dr. Marc' talks about his feelings about nude beaches, nudist campgrounds, --places he avoids like the plague.

If the book was just about life from a medical professional's point of view and the day to day grind of getting up close and personal with aches, pains, bumps, and bruises... that would have been good enough for me. Koch is just a daggum great writer. He can take the most mundane stuff and breathe life into it to make it fascinating. The beginning of the book and other sections sprinkled throughout almost felt like nonfiction, like a disgruntled physician peeling back the curtain to share what life is like on the opposite side of the examination table. But this isn't nonfiction. Thank God this isn't nonfiction. Herman Koch dabbles in fiction. Dark, twisted, beautifully written fiction. If you liked The Dinner you should enjoy this one as well. If you hated The Dinner you probably don't even care that this book exists. There are definitely some similarities between the two books. A bunch of rich people. A crazy event (this time at a summer house with a you-guessed-it swimming pool). Dumb teenagers. Unlikable parents. No one to root for. Plot twists. A great ending. I think Koch has found his niche and I expect future stuff from him will be similar, but if his next book is about deep sea fishing or molecular biology I will probably still read it."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30940542-mandy", "userReview": "I'm not sure my rating is even what I want to give it, but it's not a 5 and not quite as bad as a 1... So a 3 it is.When I checked this book out the librarian told me it was really weird. I took it with a grain of salt at the time. She was correct this book was stranger than fiction. I kept waiting for something big... A climax that never came. First off, Marc is an insane Doctor. He is selfish, so selfish that he puts his patients lives at risk. Hell he even put his own kid at risk. He shouldn't be a doctor. He isn't right in the head, but with that in mind I can see what he did, now that I've finished the story, it kinda makes sense. If I'd been in that position I might have reacted the same. Ralph and his wife are ugh. I could stand Ralph more than Judith. She is nothing but the village bicycle that everyone has had a ride on. Ralph I'm sure did his share of horndogging it around as well, but who knows.Caroline, Marc's wife irritated me. She just ignored everything and acted like it was perfectly fine! Even after the beach incident she acted like her husband should take over and there's no way I would have let him, doctor or not.For me there was no climax or point of \"oh my gosh!!!\" I kept waiting and waiting and finally I was like, well shit there isn't one.

True to form, Summer House with Swimming Pool is another plethora of characters readers love to hate. After spending a few days reading Dr Marc Schlosser's narrative of the events that eventually summons a medical review board due to a \"medical error\", I'm actually happy to rid my life of his contempt and bitter disposition.Dr Marc Schlosser is the epitome of an arrogant general doctor who does the absolute minimum. He's seen it all and is not impressed with the ailings of his patients. His practice generally thrives on word-of-mouth and he's quite fine with that. When one of his semi-famous patients Ralph Meier dies of his possible negligence or malpractice, it sets the stage for the whole novel. Because of the blurbs, most prospective readers will already be aware that something happens to his daughter Julia that demands Meier's existence be terminated. It's no shocker here that Koch paints a vivid picture through the eyes of a person that is almost as vile as his rival. I don't think that I have to like the character in order to enjoy the story he has to tell. The writing is what gets me with Summer House with Swimming Pool when all else fails. There are little nuggets of information provided that keeps readers interested. I just had to keep reading no matter how much I hated Schlosser, Meier, or even the supporting cast. Overall, I did enjoy this novel. It's grossly descriptive in parts, structurally sound, and even captivating at moments. What keeps me on the fence and unable to award it 4 stars is that I really felt at no moment did the main character grow. None of the characters made any effort to be anything other than self-absorbed, shallow individuals who never see the error in their ways. I guess that's the point. We are who we are, for better or worse.Summer House with Swimming Pool is one of those novels readers will either love or hate. I applaud those who can make a decision. I am comfortably on the fence but do suggest that those who loved The Dinner give this one a go as well. I look forward to the next group of vile characters Herman Koch can muster up for his next novel.Copy provided by Random House via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "This is one twisted dude! Marc Schlosser, the unreliable narrator, is a general practitioner. Do NOT make an appointment with him\u2014he\u2019ll fake interest but in fact he despises you. In fact, he despises everyone. He also despises the human body, so don\u2019t you dare put on one of those gowns and let him see your body or, god forbid, touch you. He has nasty things to say about every one of your nooks and crannies. Get off the table and run for your life! Marc takes joy in making his patients suffer. He lies, he condescends, he humors. He has no conscience. Just when you think he can\u2019t get any nastier, he ups his game and floors you with yet another display of his sicko weirdness. Koch is a genius at painting a clear picture of how this disgusting man thinks. The beginning of the book is really strong, as we sit wide-eyed inside the head of a sociopath. Sicko Marc elaborates on his disgust with the body, and the detailed descriptions of everything ugly about the body are phenomenal. The tone is funny, smart, and satisfying. When we get to the plot, which moves at a good clip, the writing is good as is the pacing, but it lacks the wow factor of the first third of the book. And there are a couple of events at the end of the book that seemed unrealistic (they\u2019re spoilers, so I won\u2019t elaborate). Still, the story is intriguing, and I couldn't put the book down. I was surprised that I liked it even more than The Dinner, which is a favorite.Despite Marc\u2019s hatred of the human race, he is loving and protective of his daughters, which maybe gets him out of the sociopath category a little. Is a sociopath capable of love? Though he reacts normally to the tragedy that occurs (well, mostly, that is), there are sick behaviors that he does not seem to react to in the right way. Again, I won\u2019t go into specifics because they\u2019re spoilers.Marc is not the only disgusting man in the book. There are two others. All three men have a despicable attitude toward women. The leering is beyond disgusting. One guy hangs around naked, even in front of teenage girls, grossing out even our narrator. Through brilliant writing, Koch allows his narrator to do a phenomenal job of persuading us that the naked guy is a totally repulsive scumbag slimedog.The book wins the prize for gross. I said ick a whole lot. Ick to the disgusting images our narrator shoved in our face, ick to the leering men, ick to the naked man, ick to the gross eye, ick to the way everyone behaved. And ick to the next time I go to my annual exam and have to lie down on the doctor\u2019s table, wearing one of those paper robe thingies.People who hate the much talked about unlikable narrator will hate this book. I definitely didn't like the guy, but I liked that Koch created such a fascinating character. I don't have to be in this icky guy\u2019s presence: I can sit on the sidelines and shake my head, say oh brother, and chuckle in disbelief. Is this guy for real?

This review, however, is based on the hardcover version.Not sure what it says about me that I liked this book so much - the narrator is almost a sociopath and several of the other characters are equally repugnant. But - I couldn't put it down! It fizzled a little at the end, but what a ride.The story is told by Dr. Marc Schlosser, a Dutch family doctor with a wife and two young teen daughters. The doctor treats a famous actor, Ralph Meier, who invites the doctor and his family to his summer vacation home. The doctor, who is a misogynistic asshole at best, has his eyes on Ralph's wife. Ralph, a sexual predator, has his eyes on Marc's wife and oldest daughter. When the families get together at Ralph's summer home, nothing good can come of it. Marc Schlosser is a piece of work and one of the sickest, most appalling narrators I can ever remember reading, but he is pitch perfect and his \"tone\" and viewpoint is what makes this book work so well.If you tend to give books low ratings because you don't like any of the characters, for the love of God, don't pick this up!! I can promise you will not \"like\" or relate to the characters - most of them are messed up in some way or other.

When I came over to Goodreads and saw this was designated as another literary/book clubby type of thriller I decided I probably needed to check it out. I briefly glanced at a handful of reviews and noticed several people saying how \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d they found this story. I like deeply disturbing, so that that sealed the deal and I rushed down to the local bibliotheek (that's library in Dutch - see NetGalley, I'm freaking BRILLIANT. Stop declining my requests!!!!).Now that I\u2019ve finished the book I realize that my deeply disturbing is apparently a lot (and I mean A LOT) more disturbing than the average person. What does it say about me that I really enjoyed Dr. Marc? Don\u2019t answer that \u2013 I know exactly what it says:\nWhile Marc is a revolting main character \u2013 an overt chauvinist and homophobe who can take any situation and warp it into something sexual (I\u2019m telling you, Dr. Freud would have had a heyday with this guy) or violent, I didn\u2019t find him to be nearly as disturbing as some of my other favorites . . . \n\n\n(Whooops, wrong Dexter)\nGenerally I would lower my rating for an advertised thriller that turned out to be not-so-thrilling. The saving grace for Summer House is Koch\u2019s writing. The man is brilliant. He puts the pedal to the metal on page one and never eases up, he can turn a phrase like nobody\u2019s business, and he writes the most despicable characters that I simply can\u2019t get enough of. I\u2019m not usually a huge fan of the first-person narrator, but Koch\u2019s Dr. Schlosser executed his story with damn near perfection.That\u2019s not to say I found this to be a perfect novel \u2013 thus the 4 Stars rather than 5 (duh, right?). It does a little of the bouncy-bouncy with regard to timeline at both the beginning (which I found to be necessary) and at around the 80% mark (which I did not); Marc goes from enjoyably vile to criminally negligent (and not in the way the synopsis might lead you to believe) that made me unable to keep defending his horribleness; and there was maybe one too many \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d type of recognizable plot points meant to perplex the reader. All that being said, at the end of it all I found this to be a superb follow-up to last year\u2019s blockbuster. I\u2019ll anxiously await Koch\u2019s (and Sam Garrett's \u2013 Koch would not rank so high on the enjoyability scale if he did not have such a spectacular translator) next creation.Recommended to: Anyone who likes to hate everyone in a book and doesn\u2019t mind feeling like they need a good scrub down with some lye-soap and a wire brush after they are finished reading.Although I was denied an ARC (most likely because I write super-gify reviews and the publisher was terrified what kind of crap I would spew out on this one), I still read/reviewed it anyway.

A doctor to members of the \u201ccreative class\u201d \u2013 movie/TV stars, writers, producers, some professionals, very few \u201c9 to 5 types\u201d \u2013 he is ruthless in his assessment of their vanities and their sagging, aging bodies. These celebrities have come to him because he\u2019s less judgmental in their drinking and drugging habits, and he\u2019s liberal in handing out prescriptions. But unbeknownst to them Schlosser seethes with hatred, boredom and a disgust that borders on the sociopathic.Here he is describing what he sees during a typical day: I see and hear things all day long. Things you need to get off your mind at night. The fungal growths. The bleeding warts. The folds of skin between which things have gotten much, much too warm. The three-hundred-pound woman you have to examine in a place you hoped you\u2019d never have to go again.I won\u2019t go on. There are descriptions that verge on misogyny, Patrick Bateman territory, but of course Marc is a character, not the author.Koch is at his funniest when he\u2019s sending up theatre, which, given my job, was a hoot to read about. One of the perks of his profession Marc hates most is attending book readings and movie premieres and theatre openings that his patients are involved in. He\u2019ll often duck out of a movie premiere to hang out in the washroom or lobby. You can\u2019t do that at plays. Here\u2019s Marc describing some of the outlandish productions he\u2019s had to sit through: It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d been invited to a Shakespeare. I\u2019d already seen about ten of his plays. A version of The Taming of the Shrew in which all the male roles were played by women, The Merchant of Venice with the actors in diapers and the actresses wearing garbage bags for dresses and shopping bags on their heads, Hamlet with an all-Down-syndrome cast, wind machines, and a (dead) goose that was decapitated onstage, King Lear with Zimbabwean orphans and ex-junkies, Romeo and Juliet in the never-completed tunnel of a subway line, with concentration camp photos projected on the sewage-streaked walls. A Macbeth in which all the female roles were played by naked men \u2013 the only clothing they were was a thong btween their buttocks, and they had handcuffs and weights hanging from their nipples \u2013 and performed to a soundtrack consisting of artillery barrages, Radiohead tunes, and poems by Radovan Karadzic. Besides the fact that you didn\u2019t dare to look at how the handcuffs and weights were attached to (or through) the nipples, the problem once again was a matter of how slowly the time passed. I can remember delays at airports that must have lasted half a day, easily, but which were over ten times as quickly as any of those plays.This is Koch at his best: brutally, savagely satirical, skewering the glitterati with diabolical glee.Unfortunately, the book\u2019s story \u2013 about Schlosser\u2019s part in the death of a famous actor named Ralph Maier \u2013 isn\u2019t as fine as Koch\u2019s prose. It\u2019s told in a circuitous fashion, and the plot hinges on a tragedy that happened on the beach near Maier\u2019s summer home. I won\u2019t spoil the details. But some sections are overwritten, and the characters are so unlikeable that in a way you don\u2019t care what happens to anyone. Koch has an annoying habit of beginning chapters with weighty, ponderous statements: I often wondered later on whether things would have turned out differently if the Latvian girl had remained on her feet.***There are times when you run back through your life, to see whether you can locate the point at which it could still have taken a different turn.***That evening, the rest of our lives began. Let me say right now that I\u2019m not a big fan of melodrama. I also have a natural aversion to dramatic statements. The rest of our lives\u2026 I\u2019d heard people say that often enough. People who had lost someone or something. Who\u2019d had something happen to them that you wouldn\u2019t wish on anyway \u2013 something you would never get over. Still, it had always sounded fake to me. It\u2019s only when it happens to you that you know it\u2019s not fake. There is simply no better description for it than \u201cthe rest of your life.\u201d Everything gets heavier. Especially time. Something happens to time. It doesn\u2019t really stand still, but there\u2019s no denying that it slows down. This is fine writing, a tad self-indulgent, but at times I wanted to prod Koch/Schlosser and say\u2026. OKAY! GET ON WITH IT!Don\u2019t get me wrong. I liked this book. It\u2019s sharply written. Nobody knows how to analyze the little details of human behaviour \u2013 especially among strutting, cocky upper-middle-class men \u2013 than Koch. As in The Dinner, I had problems with this book\u2019s resolution. It just didn\u2019t have the force that I think the author intended. But I\u2019ll read whatever he writes, knowing beforehand that if I don\u2019t like his characters, I at least will find it interesting getting under their slimy skin for a few days."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "I am not going to rate this because I cannot finish it.

His characters are far from perfect and border between very imperfect and downright sleazy. Yet they wander amongst the privileged crowd; artist, doctors, producers who exude a shallow tide of civilization along with the well-hidden skeletons. Whatever your opinion of the uncomfortable topic which is slowly revealed in the novel, Koch's prose reels you in and immerses you into the plot like sirens off the shore.Our narrator is general practitioner Dr. Marc Schlosser, who tends to an elite bunch of celebrities despite his cynicism and partially due to his generosity with prescriptions. We find out early in the book that he is being suspected of medical malpractice allegedly contributing to the death of a famous actor named Ralph Meier. Marc, the epitome of the unreliable narrator, takes us back to the beginning of Ralph and Marc's acquaintance. Friendship is too strong a word as we learn of the doctor's cynical view of his patients and human nature in general. Marc and his family, which includes two young daughters, are invited to the Meier's summer house and he becomes suspicious of Ralph's intention with his wife and daughters, a suspicion which is complicated by Marc's own infatuation with Ralph's wife, Judith.There are few places where the phrase, \"what a tangled web we weave\" is so well practiced. Much of the delicious tension in this book is fueled not by action but by the complex thoughts and feelings our unreliable narrator places in his tale. We see everything from his perceptive. He is a very flawed protagonist but so is everyone else in the book. As we learn about the past events, we wonder many things. Who is responsible for the crime? (a crime which I won't reveal and hopefully you did not read the book's promo blurbs which shamelessly gives it and other things away too early) Was Dr. Schlosser's malpractice one of neglect or murder? Eventually we find these things out but I believe the author's focus isn't on the answers but on bigger questions such as why we as human beings work so hard to do the very things that make our lives so miserable. In Koch's world, The road to hell may be paved with good intentions but it keeps us there with a fair amount of quicksand.I've heard great things about Koch's debut novel, The Dinner. I have not read it but based on this second novel, Herman Koch seems to be a literary force to deal with.

The things that go through his mind as his patients file through with their litanies of bodily complaints and malfunctions are terrible, but so entertaining!When I have an appointment with my family doctor, he asks a couple of perfunctory questions and then spends most of the remaining time typing on the computer.

At the time I gave it four stars. I don't know why I did. My memory of the book was that Elementary Particles was a misanthropic bore. There must have been something more to the novel I remember, but whatever was charming about the book to me long since forgotten (if there was something charming about EP it was forgotten fairly quickly because I can remember that a couple of years after that already telling people I disliked Houellebecq's book when asked, an opinion that confused me when I later noticed that I had given the book four stars).This book feels like the author is trying to be Houellebecq in his general misanthropy and disdain of just about everyone but without whatever that elusive thing that I had found charming in Elementary Particles. It's not that I found the constant the Celine-esque blah to the world-ness off putting, it was that there didn't seem to be any reason for it all. The story for the book seemed fairly insubstantial and pages were just filled with a string of mini-rants against all different types of people. The structure of the book set up a moment near the climax or resolution to start off the book and then the story went back to the start until at the end it met up with the resolution.... which is a fine style to use, but I felt it took way to long to get into the story that was being hinted at near the start. Which is fine, but I couldn't figure out why a lot of what was in the book was necessary. To many things seemed to be started and then never returned to, things that seemed more like vehicles to rant against one thing or another. When the story finally does get going certain details are left coyly absent. Things that weren't too difficult to figure out or which were soon revealed where given the 'oh I can't tell you this' treatment. But after so many pages of blunt descriptions it seemed like a cheap trick to drag out some suspense by having the narrator say things like, 'I don't feel comfortable telling you what happened to my daughter'. Great keep it to yourself, but the description of what finally happened is kind of incongruous with what was described when he first discovers her and, well, I was already finding the book to be a tiresome bore and this just made it feel like a cheap literary trick. Like this distracted review I'm trying to write and just not feeling, this book seems to be lacking focus. It might sound like I disliked the book, and I guess I did but I mostly just felt really indifferent about it. There's got to be better contemporary European literature that can be brought to our shores and given attention by a major publisher than this book. Disclaimer....

Koch, the sculptor, forms a piece of art, his words used like a hunk of clay that he carves in intricate layers before our eyes. He is a master at presenting characters that are not only unlikeable but are disturbing. We are sucked in slowly, introduced to general practitioner, Dr. Marc Schlosser. Before long, we wonder just what kind of doctor is he, this man who views his patients with contempt and has utter disregard for the human body. He examines his patients using tactics to avoid any contact with human flesh, rarely having them disrobe for a complete exam, never taking seriously the medical treatment or advice they may need. This doctor truly nauseates me but the thoughts that go through his mind fascinate me nonetheless. Then one of Dr. Schlosser's patients, if not a good friend, at least an acquaintance, dies. Is this medical euthanasia , malpractice, or something far more sinister?As he did so well in The Dinner, Koch manages to weave a complicated, tangled psychological story with just a handful of skillfully developed characters.

Sorry about that.I'm conflicted. Mainly because I don't know to whom I should give half of the credit. Herman Koch is a Norwegian author who seems incapable of telling a poorly-told tale. But I have no idea how good of a writer he is. You see, Koch doesn't write in English. His novels are translated by a guy named Sam Garrett. I know things get lost or changed in translation. This is fact. There are words in English that simply do not exist in other languages and vice versa. But it should be known that, while I do not know who to congratulate, this book read exquisitely well, as did my first Koch read, The Dinner. And guess what? Sam translated that one too. Who gets the credit for this butter-smooth prose? Unless I learn Norwegian, I'll never know.What I do know is, Summer House with Swimming Pool is an amazingly well-told story about people who're terrible at being human. Several tough subjects are broached: infidelity, euthanasia, age of consent, and capital punishment for child molesters (which I agree with, no bones about it; I believe a person who forces themselves on a child shouldn't share the air I breathe, even moreso than a murderer because a pedophile's victims continue to suffer long after the act, whereas a murderer's victim is dead and gone.) The plot is wonderfully twisty, but the twists and turns are only half the entertainment value to be had. The exemplary character writing floored me, even moreso than with The Dinner. At first, Summer House with Swimming Pool was okay. I found it bit unfocused and confusing, but I needn't have worried. All was brought to light by the end. And then it jumped from okay to good... from good to great... from great to amazing. In the simplest language, it kept getting better and better. That cannot be said for many novels. But do not get me wrong. The book didn't start badly and get better. It maintained upward momentum throughout. I will be talking about this novel for some time.A word of warning to those of you who believe this to be light summer reading, as suggested by the cutesy blue-and-yellow cover. This book can be at times disturbing. There is a scene involving a needle and an eyeball. I will say no more. If you believe that such things should never come in contact with each other and that having them do so would ruin your reading experience, please pass up this novel. If you're like me and you enjoy disturbing content, hop aboard. We'll be making stops at least every fifty pages.In summation: Herman Koch is now on my Must-Buy list. He has a new novel coming in 2016 and I am now eagerly awaiting it. I might have to take up Norwegian so I can read his earlier books, or, you know, Crown Publishing can get the lead out of their asses and publish the rest of this dude's back catalog. Love ya for it.Final Judgment: Will probably end up on my Top Five of 2015 list.I received this book from http://www.bloggingforbooks.org/ for this review. They make me say that because of the FTC and all that jazz. It didn't sway my final judgment.

As he speaks about his patients in detail, he suppresses no thoughts or feelings whatsoever.Most of us tend to hate going to the doctor. We hate to hear things that we already believe is wrong with us and hate that we have to sit in a waiting room much longer than it takes the doctor to tend to our physical and sometimes more important mental state. Schlosser, on the contrary, seems to do the opposite: he gives each one time to talk, but also gives a false sense of security. The perception that a doctor truly cares for us is what we really want and he, deceivingly, does this, which makes a person think, how many doctors actually feel this way about their patients? Do we ever try to think from the doctor's point of view? No, we're too worried about our own selves to think, 'Hey, this person doesn't want to see me as much as I want to see them, so why bother?'.This is the type of book that a person like myself enjoys because I don't always like happy endings. I don't always like things that are set in stone. Happy is nice, when it needs to be.It does pose a series of questions though: If you have the ability to ruin (or take) someone's life, unbeknownst to them, because you believe they ruined yours or someone you loved, would you do it? Would your morals be interrupted by unrelenting rage? Would you feel remorse if that belief turned out to be false? Do we succumb to our innate morality to be good when things radically change?I can see where this wouldn't be for everyone. Such brutal honesty scares many of us, but is entertaining and thought provoking for others.

No other writer makes me feel as uncomfortable as Koch's writing does. I can make this generalisation now that I read, well, listened to, three of his books.How I felt about this novel could be summarised by the following \"eloquent\" expressions: \"Ewww\", \"Oh, No, you didn't just think/say that!?\", \"WOW\", \"Holly $%&t\", plus a few more unsavoury thoughts about men, that I will spare you (You're welcome ;-) ).Our unreliable narrator and protagonist is Dr. Marc Schlosser, a general practitioner, who dislikes his patients, seeing their ugly bodies, with their saggy, hairy, moist places where the sun doesn't shine. (Don't shoot the messenger, Koch is much more descriptive). The dude is not very kind towards fat people, people who drink (as someone who is over the glorification of \"getting pissed\" as some sort of virtue, I found his stance on drinking and hardened livers somewhat refreshing, although, I've never heard of livers exploding). Koch is great at unravelling the contradictions of the human nature, the dichotomy of thought and action. Most characters are unlikeable, but the men are horrible, despicable, deplorable, vile, and/or pathetic. If you're after a feel-good story, don't pick one of Koch's novels. If you like being challenged, surprised, horrified, grossed out, and also don't mind hearing some unspeakable, unlikeable opinions, then you'll enjoy, better said, appreciate Koch's twisted mind.

As Marc muses, \u201cSometimes you run your life back to see at what point it could have taken a different turn. But sometimes there\u2019s nothing at all to run back \u2013 you yourself don\u2019t know it yet, but the only button that\u2019s still working is forward.\u201dIt\u2019s up to the reader to learn what he\u2019s referring to. This is a page-turning psychological suspense novel, with intriguing undercurrents of Dutch medicine and euthanasia, the lies we tell ourselves, the objectification of young girls, our worship of celebrity status and much more. It strives to be unsettling and sometimes it is, to a fault. But it\u2019s still a darn good read!"}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5846407-bill", "userReview": "*Review for audio version*Peter Berkrot\u2019s narration for this one was freaking perfect. I can\u2019t imagine a better voice for the main character of Dr. Marc Schlosser. The dry sarcasm and dark humor flowed easily and effortlessly throughout.Dr. Marc Schlosser is a general practitioner and a genuine grade-A S.O.B. If you\u2019re looking for a feel good, redemptive tale, you have come to the wrong spot. There are no redeeming qualities about the main character in this one. Our protagonist is exactly who he is supposed to be and there are no apologies made about it.Very well written with deeply drawn characters and a solid, somewhat meandering, plot line. Excellent. An easy 4+ stars for story alone and 5 stars with the spot on narration. Highly Recommended!Thanks to Edward and Gregor who turned me on to this.

Some order up the equivalent of a hot stone massage; others might enjoy an acid facial peel. Which brings us to Herman Koch\u2019s caustic new novel, \u201cSummer House With Swimming Pool.\u201d Last year, this bestselling Dutch novelist published \u201cThe Dinner,\u201d about two warring couples at an Amsterdam restaurant. This year, he delivers a more expansive but even more poisonous novel about rivals vacationing in the Mediterranean.No matter how cheaply you travel, no hotel room will ever feel as cramped and sordid as the mind of this narrator, Dr. Marc Schlosser. He boasts, \u201cI\u2019m more charming than most men,\u201d but that\u2019s true only if most men are sociopaths, and Sam Garrett\u2019s slightly stilted translation only adds to the reptilian tone of the doctor\u2019s thoughts.By freely prescribing painkillers, Schlosser has developed a lucrative practice among entertainment celebrities, all of whom disgust him. Disgust, in fact, is this novel\u2019s terminal condition. Filled with clammy rage, Schlosser finds his patients\u2019 bodies abhorrent; he takes perverse relish in mocking their pale buttocks, their enlarged prostates, their bleeding gums: \u201cI look, but the way you might look at a dead animal in the road.\u201d He subtly encourages the depressives to kill themselves. He fantasizes about pricking them with hepatitis A or aggravating cancerous growths with sloppy biopsies.Warning: Do not read this book within three weeks of any medical appointment.The story begins when the widow of the late movie star Ralph Meier bursts into Schlosser\u2019s office and accuses him of malpractice. Schlosser doesn\u2019t deny the accusation; instead, he takes us into his confidence and describes the vacation he and his family took with the Meiers the previous summer. From the start, it\u2019s a trip laced with sexual tension, equal parts adultery and pedophilia. Ralph Meier is a large, lecherous man who licks his lips while staring at Schlosser\u2019s wife. He horses around the pool naked with Schlosser\u2019s two young daughters. Schlosser fights back, not by leaving but by coming on to Ralph\u2019s wife.I couldn\u2019t stop reading this, but I can\u2019t remember the last time a book made me want to crawl out of my own skin. Chapter by chapter, it is shockingly cynical and infected with a strain of humor so toxic that it should come with a bottle of Purell. Just when you feel you\u2019ve got to turn away, the temperature of this dark sex comedy spikes with an act of violence that would inspire any normal person to call the police. Instead, our narrator\u2019s anger quietly metastasizes.Through all this, we hear Schlosser\u2019s doubt-free commentary, complete with his grotesque declarations: \u201cAll men feel drawn to young girls\u201d \u201cA half-rape \u2014 women always like that. All women.\u201d \u201cA homosexual is nothing more than a walking contraceptive.\u201d Wholly candid about his cynical manipulation of others, he\u2019s someone who might treat you at the Patricia Highsmith HMO. You wouldn\u2019t want to vacation with this monster \u2014 or sit on his cold examining table, but seeing him splayed out here on Koch\u2019s pages is ghoulishly fascinating.Bon voyage!This review was originally published in The Washington Post:http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta..."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "Marc Schlosser is a General Practitioner in Holland, where he lives with his wife Judith and daughters Julia and Lisa. Marc is presented as a very unsympathetic character \u2013 despite dealing on a daily basis with people, he is disgusted by their bodies and the physical contact he needs to have with his patients. Most of his patients are those who work in the arts \u2013 writers, comedians, television personalities and actors. One of those is Ralph Meier, a large and imposing theatre actor with a huge personality to match his girth. Before long, the family doctor has been invited to one of Meier\u2019s opening nights; such invitations are tortuous to him (as someone who ranks going to the cinema/theatre as one of their least favourite things to do, I sympathised) and his recitations of time passing so slowly during a performance or his distaste of his patients may be cruel, but are also darkly humorous.The novel begins with the revelation that Meier has suffered some kind of medical negligence, of which Marc Schlosser stands accused. As he prepares to face the findings of the Board of Medical Examiners, the book takes us through the summer when Marc and his family spend time with Ralph Meier, at their summer house \u2013 with, of course, a pool. Ralph is there with wife Caroline, her mother, and his sons Alex and Thomas, plus the sharp talking Stanley, who is attempting to involve Ralph in a Hollywood mini-series, and his much younger girlfriend, Emmmanuelle. There are all kinds of personal attractions and relationships going on and the visit \u2013 and summer \u2013 culminates in a tragic event, which indirectly results in the case being built against Marc.I have read, and loved, The Dinner and I imagine that this novel will cause as much controversy as that book did. In fact, if you did read The Dinner and disliked it, then I wouldn\u2019t even bother picking this up \u2013 you probably won\u2019t like it. If, however, you did enjoy it, then I think you will find this a riveting read. It addresses a lot of issues which will make people feel uncomfortable, including Marc\u2019s attitudes, the sexuality of young girls and the way some men view women. Personally, I don\u2019t necessarily need to like the characters in a book to enjoy the story, and, in an odd way, you do warm to Marc. More importantly, this author writes wonderfully well and he knows how to tell a story and keep you turning pages. At all times he is in control of the storyline, characters and you know what Marc is feeling and how he responds. If you do pick this book up, then don\u2019t expect to put it down until you have finished it; you will really need to know how what happens to the characters involved. It is also a brilliant read for book groups, with much to discuss and is bound to polarise opinions and get people talking \u2013 as good literature should.I received a copy of this book from the publishers, via NetGalley, for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Jo\u00e3o Carlos", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17544299-jo-o-carlos", "userReview": "Um enredo \u201cid\u00eantico\u201d ao seu romance \u201dO Jantar\u201d.O mesmo estilo de escrita, previs\u00edvel, repetitiva e sem suspense\u2026\u00c9 absolutamente lament\u00e1vel e vergonhosa a sinopse presente na contracapa da edi\u00e7\u00e3o portuguesa editada pela Alfaguara.

But the weight of carrying such a secret lies heavily on his mind, and he can't keep hiding from the truth\u2026or the Board of Medical Examiners.The problem is that the real truth is a bit worse than a simple slipup. Marc played a role in Ralph's death, and he's not exactly upset that the man is gone. Still haunted by his eldest daughter's rape during their stay at Ralph's extravagant Mediterranean summerhouse-one they shared with Ralph and his enticing wife, Judith, film director Stanley Forbes and his far younger girlfriend, Emmanuelle, and Judith's mother-Marc has had it on his mind that the perpetrator of the rape could be either Ralph or Stanley. Stanley's guilt seems obvious, bearing in mind his uncomfortable fixation on the prospect of Marc's daughter's fashion career, but Marc's reasons for wanting Ralph dead become increasingly compelling as events unravel. There is damning evidence against Marc, but he isn't alone in his loathing of the star-studded director.", "title": "Summer House with Swimming Pool", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18594633-summer-house-with-swimming-pool", "average": 3.4, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1384734826l/18594633.jpg", "reviews": 2340, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1245772.Herman_Koch", "name": "Herman Koch"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/24777.Sam_Garrett", "name": "Sam Garrett"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Contemporary", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18594633-summer-house-with-swimming-pool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25420262", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22078282-summer-house-with-swimming-pool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23592421-summer-house-with-swimming-pool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21560035-summer-house-with-swimming-pool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19534003-casa-de-f-rias-com-piscina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15797938-the-dinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186095-dear-mr-m", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34183445-makkelijk-leven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31368475-de-greppel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2992957-red-ons-maria-montanelli"]}
