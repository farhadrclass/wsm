It was to combat the depression that the members of her book club had encountered over the years. If you see the Oprah\u2019s Book Club logo on a book you are about to crack open, take your Zoloft now.Now, hear me out. I have never been disappointed with a book from the Oprah Book Club list. Drowning Ruth, Gap Creek, Jewel, The Pilot\u2019s Wife. They are always amazing stories that will bring on a slue of intense emotions. I am no way suggesting you should shy away from them. Unless your dog just died.Vinegar Hill has an amazing cast of characters, 98% of which I wanted to strangle on a regular basis. If you follow me on Twitter, you would have seen tweets suggesting that I already had a deep hate for someone thirty pages in the book. My hate list just grew and grew. Then Ansay threw a monkey wrench into my hate wagon\u2019s spokes and brought on the flashbacks. As the story unfolds, you get introduced to events that made these insanely obnoxious people the way they were.OH! Do I continue to hate them because they are assholes or do I walk a mile in their shoes? Damn you, Oprah! Damn you!I found myself wanting to give the characters advice. If I could pull her aside for just one minute and say, \u201cRun! Run for your life!\u201d. This is why non-book people think book people are crazy. I\u2019m whispering life changing suggestions to fictional characters.What I hate about writing these reviews is avoiding spoilers. There is so much I want to tell you, but I don\u2019t want to ruin it for you! Grab your Zoloft, grab Vinegar Hill. You can thank me for the multiple emotions you experience later."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/844947-cindy", "userReview": "To me, Oprah's Book Club seal of approval guarantees me at least a few of the following:1) Female, middle-aged protagonist, typically a mother 2) Generally bleak and depressing3) Emotional and/or physical abuse4) Jackass husband5) Horrible children6) DeathVinegar Hill offers 5 of the 6 - no horrible children. It's a very quick read - maybe not light enough fare for the beach but for the subway ride to and from work, it's perfect. A brief synopsis: Ellen + husband + their 2 kids are forced to move back into the house that her jackass husband grew up in and live together with his abusive and emotionally unavailable parents. Actually, everyone in this book is emotionally unavailable and also a little off their rocker so I bet you can imagine all the fun that will ensue. Oh yes.

I don't always know when I'm reading an Oprah book (I come into possession of a lot of books with no covers somehow), but after I read this one I just knew it was on her list, had to be. It was very bleak, as most of her selections are, and had very little to make me want to finish it. If I hadn't been very bored at the time I probably wouldn't have.

I chose a book with less than 300 pages and hoped for the best. This book had been sitting on my shelf for a little while and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect. This was actually a good read and I\u2019m going to give it 4 stars. Vinegar Hill is one of the most appropriately named books I\u2019ve read in a while. The Grier family is a family that is completely affected, influenced, formed, created and responding to the very \u201cvinegar\u201d that has been steeped into their individual lives. Adjectives that come to mind: raw, bitter, dysfunction, pain, fear, confusion, hurt, anger, in need of serious SERIOUS therapy every single one of them. James and wife Ellen have financial troubles so they take their two children and move back to the small town, cold home of his already completely dysfunctional parents Mary Margaret and Fritz. As a reader, we walk into an atmosphere that reeks of secrets, pain and a spirit of something very very wrong. I must say this author is so skillful because I literally felt this every time, as we read, we are in this house. If this house could talk, I\u2019m sure it would cry. If it had ghosts, it would need an exorcism. The people who live here are all fighting past experiences that they have allowed to fester and form their current selves. Now forced to live in this overcrowded house together, things are coming to a head. This is their story. A. Manette Ansay is a very skillful author. I loved her style of writing because it is very unique. Vinegar Hill is very easily read. No analogies or symbolism to decipher here, just good writing. I enjoyed how each chapter unfolds a little more of the characters as well as involves the readers emotions in the story. I always believe if an author can get any kind of rise out of me, that\u2019s good stuff. I was most definitely involved. The story is very raw and real. This could and may very well be some real family struggling somewhere. Do I recommend it? Yes I do. I will read this author again. I do recommend it to those enjoying the historical fiction genre because it does take place in 1972, however, it is more contemporary fiction. I give it 4 stars for the skill of the author, good story and emotional involvement. PS. I still want to magically jump into the book and knock a few folks in the head: some for sense, some for stupidity and some because bullies need put into their place no matter how old they are. Read the book and find out what I\u2019m talking about. ;oP"}, {"userName": "Karyl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl", "userReview": "I read this book in just two days. Obviously it is a very quick read, and I kept wanting to pick the book up again and read a few pages. Yes, this book is bleak and depressing, but it seems very realistic. Before divorce was as common as marriage, people stayed together no matter what, regardless of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse -- all of which occur to the women in this book. I find the end to be very hopeful; the wife decides to make a change right as her daughter stands on the brink of puberty. One hopes that she has saved her daughter in time from making the same mistakes. Other reviewers complain about the claustrophobic and bleak nature of the imagery, but for me it reinforces the claustrophobia and the bleak world in which the protagonist lives. When you're living in depression, you can barely see past your own nose, and the author did a wonderful job of expressing that.This isn't one of the best books that I have read, but it did hold my interest and occupy me for a couple of days. If you are one for light and amusing chick lit, I would not recommend this to you."}, {"userName": "K.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1265092-k", "userReview": "\"What she wanted now was to frighten him with her own flesh, with what he had rejected; to make him feel ashamed the way he made her feel ashamed.\"Chosen for Book Riot's 2018 Read Harder Challenge - \"an Oprah Book Club selection\". To set the scene: we're in the midwest United States, in the 1970s. Ellen, James and their two children move back in with James's parents after he loses his job. He seems content to stay there, oh, forever, and Ellen could not conceive of anything worse. Their relationship, which we come to find out was only pushed to such a permanent state due to the impropriety of being stuck overnight together in a car during a blizzard, is barely existent. Ellen is so desperately unhappy; her mother-in-law Mary-Margaret is frail and bitter and caustic, her father-in-law has an explosive temper and quick fists.Ansay does her best to nudge you toward one view of Mary-Margaret (awful) through Ellen and her daughter's points-of-view, and then turns it around so we can get a glimpse of what it's like to be Mary-Margaret, with a Level Four Tragic Backstory. Don't get me wrong, it's terrible (child death and domestic abuse and marital rape), but I found it difficult to feel anything more than vague pity because she was still inflicting emotional pain onto others with her behavior in the present narrative.Ellen is troubled and depressed and angry and apathetic, all of which comes in waves. She finally learns some Real Truths about her husband's family (see: Tragic Backstory) and this, in the end, is when she is finally able to come to a decision for her own family. It is a very bittersweet ending, with only the slightest bit of hope to cut through the bleakness of the overall tone of the novel. I didn't dislike it, but god, was I ever sad after it ended."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2646106-lori", "userReview": "I'm giving this novel 3 stars only because of the quality of the writing. The actual story itself is morose, and rather self-indulgent... I'm afraid that novelists often feel that to write well they must include and focus upon the truly horrible aspects of life while ignoring any of the light. There was not one character in the novel I could relate to; they all seemed extraordinarily weak and childish. When Ellen, the pseudo main character, finally decides to use her backbone, the novel is suddenly over. No one else seems to experience much growth, though we are shown, in memory sequences, why everyone is as messed up as they are... and a lot of that seems to be based around how religion can be twisted to justify cruelty and misogyny. Which, let's face it, is a tired old Stephen King construct. So... I often caution against the bad writing/great story combination. Sorry to review one that is the exact opposite! Oh, and can we all agree that Oprah's Book Club picks are NOT to be trusted?"}, {"userName": "Margery", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2015078-margery", "userReview": "Depressing.The writing is repetitive, and the visuals are uncreative and obviously depressing. She hits you over the head with the misery of her characters, but to what point?Shockingly mean and violent events abound, but again I saw no point. The only character that was suprred to action by the violent events is not even alive in the time line of the novel. We never meet her and it is only through the fog of time that she manages to \"help\" our main character. And that help is feeble, uncelebrated. Our main character seems to want to change, seems to suggest she might, but I have no faith that if the book continued she would change or find happiness. A book needs a point, and this book's point must have been to be pitied."}, {"userName": "Kaleah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52357224-kaleah", "userReview": "This book is definitely not for everyone. It is stark and depressing. The characters are not likable. I would only read bits at a time, which is why it took me so long to finish it. However, it still resonated with me. For those who have grown up in a dysfunctional family, have been in a dysfunctional marriage, or have had negative experiences with strange, manipulative religion, you might appreciate this book. The author creates a perpetual winter with this story, both in setting and within the characters themselves. Bitterness is laced throughout, including in the title and the location of the house where the story takes place in, Vinegar Hill. Ellen, the main character, must find a way to live amongst vile in-laws, an emotionally absent husband, and demanding children, without allowing them to break her. The father-in-law is controlling and abusive, her mother-in-law an overly critical, hateful woman who carries her own secrets of pain and betrayal. Every character, no matter how horrible or weak they may be, has a past that helps paint a picture of why they turned out the way that they did. I appreciated the authenticity of this, and I believe it added richness to the story.Ellen also has to endure stifling religion perpetuated by everyone close to her, from the in-laws to her own sisters. The decisions that she faces are hard ones to make, especially considering that the story takes place in the '70's. She wrestles with her faith at times while trying to come to terms with the state of her life, her marriage, her happiness. This is the story of her journey through a very harsh winter, literally and metaphorically. Although the ending didn't seem to fit quite right in my opinion, this is a book that I will pick up from time to time to digest bits and pieces. It's somewhat like therapy in that sense, and it will, at the very least, probably make you feel better about any hard times you may be going through in your own life."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2721432-dana", "userReview": "Accordng to the Oprah Book Club reviews I have seen, most were negative.

Dark. Haunting.Vinegar Hill is so, so much darker than expected when I first picked up the book from a Book Sale. It tells of a story of a woman living in her own stifling world of marriage, religion, and expectations. Ellen Grier steps out of her in-laws house every night. For all appearances, Ellen looks like any other wife and mother out for her daily walk and the house looks like any other house, which shadows visible on its window any other old married couple. But, no. There are unspeakable secrets behind the flower curtains. There's cruelty distributed regularly along with dry roasts on white, daisy-decorated plates. And Ellen is a woman feeling trapped to the brink of desperation. She knows she can't stay on the same place but all her choices are stifled, her world(Midwestern 1970s) so utterly patriarchal, her husband stupidly stubborn or vice versa, and even her own family so traditional in its views about marriage and women. This alone is enough for the book to qualify as horror for me.  A. Manette Ansay has a gift of cruelty. She captured it so well with little nuances, calculated words, and small acts of selfishness. I started hating everyone and everything about Vinegar Hill from first chapter. Even Ellen's helplessness grates on my nerves.Then of course, I learned some things about the characters' past, small and powerful glimpses which were so well-written and almost too hard to swallow that turned my hatred to mere dislike and eventually heartbreak. For of course, the characters in this book are not regular people at all. They are badly wounded, badly twisted animals trapped in one dark, loveless place. How can they not strike at each other?The book is a quick read with one apparent theme since page one to the last- Suffering. Never-ending suffering.

It it bears any resemblance to your life, it's going to depress you further. If it doesn't, it's just going to depress you, end of story. The one-dimensional characters plodded through their lives, lifting their heads long enough for a crop of flashback sequences that made it clear that their lives had always been full of the kind of bleak everyday horrors that made them the bleak horrible people they became. The story limps on to a conclusion that is no real conclusion at all. It just kind of stops.

At the time I read the book I enjoyed it.. I couldn't put it down because you could just feel the tension building within the house and the family. It was like the author put a microscope on one family's situation and homelife and honed in on it and exposed it in the form of this book for everyone to see. It was at times disturbing - I wanted to sometimes step into the book and become a mediator but as in life, when you are so closely involved you can't see the big picture. Now, a few years after reading this I have a whole new appreciation for this book because my family had to move in with my grandparents for a couple years. It's surprising how the smallest things can blow up when tensions are running high within a tiny house with too many people.

(?) This book left an overall feeling of hopelessness and discouragement. It's about an extended midwestern German family of an older time (not quite sure when) and their sense of living according to God's word and their sense of duty to family. That way of life was often stern and forbidding, especially if you were unlucky enough to be forced into a loveless and unhappy marriage and/or born into a miserable childhood. Of course, those circumstances created some characters with very skewed thinking...I often found myself wondering who would possibly imagine such wild and incomprehensible thoughts. Not a happy book.

Even the children are sad and unlovable as characters. There is the usual plight of women in that time, and also the theme of crazy in laws and family secrets, mind you, this couple was mild next to my own ex in laws. I feel like the protagonist was profoundly depressed, and while that is valid enough, it does not make for great reading. So many of this elderly couple's antics could have just been laughed at, these were very elderly people, they aren't about to change for anyone, you can only tolerate, laugh and roll your eyes I guess. But someow, the author did not allow us to laugh. The narrator did a fine job, and for that reason only did I finish this book, but then I regretted it, because I had been expecting at least some sort of epiphany or wild change to come about in the end...but no. The ending was flat. Nothing more than a maybe. A what if. A might. Just an idea. And that was already in my mind, I needed something to come to fruition, there was no satisfaction to be had for sticking it through with this story. None at all.

However, the author is able to offer us glimpses into the minds of the other characters as well. This allow us to understand how two people can experience the seem events but in very different ways. Our experiences in life really can color our whole perception of reality. At times in the story I was shocked that the characters involved seemed incapable of recognizing their own story in the plight of others. Instead of offering kindness and understanding it appears they are only able to offer judgement and hostility. This books also makes me think about how much harder our mothers and grandmothers had things. The freedoms we as women take for granted simply were not granted to previous generations. We are reminded how much of an impact our words and actions, especially those of parents, can have. One of the main characters is so damaged by his childhood that he is incapable of having healthy family life. There are examples throughout the story of a someones actions or words long ago continuing to impact the lives of future generations.Although emotionally difficult at times it is well worth reading.

And his mother is not nice at all to anyone in the family except for her beloved James, her baby who cannot do any wrong.Ellen is miserable, the kids are miserable, seems like James\u2019s parents aren\u2019t too happy either, but James is perfectly content.Will Ellen ever get up the courage to make some decisions on her own and make a change to better her family, with or without James?This book is a more subtle read about family that, although it\u2019s not some mind-blowing plot, kept me interested from page 1. Worth the read. But don\u2019t take my word for it, Oprah did choose it a few years ago for her book club.Are you a fan of Oprah\u2019s book choices?Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael", "userReview": "Normally I do not like Oprah book recommendations, we differ in taste. However I wanted to read this book based on a friend review and needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The one thing that caught my attention while reading this book was the language. The story was very evocative, it was almost like you were actually a character going through the journey with them all. Ellen Grier voice was haunting, the trials she went through as a mother & wife was heartbreaking. I can tell that she really loved her kids, wanting nothing more to sweep them away to somewhere safe. Although her home was a haven, there were so much resentment in her household. James, her reckless husband did not even show affection for his own children. In addition to not being concerned about their affairs, his past defined who he was as an individual.This book touched me deeply, some parts were disturbing to read. Not to take away anything from the beauty of the novel but reading through all of the sufferings was difficult. I happen to enjoy this novel tremendously and looking forward to reading more novels by Ansay."}], "description": "In a stark, troubling, yet ultimately triumphant celebration of self-determination, award-winning author A. Manette Ansay re-creates a stifling world of guilty and pain, and the tormented souls who inhabit it. It is 1972 when circumstance carries Ellen Grier and her family back to Holly's Field, Wisconsin. Dutifully accompanying her newly unemployed husband, Ellen has brought her two children into the home of her in-laws on Vinegar Hill -- a loveless house suffused with the settling dust of bitterness and routine -- where calculated cruelty is a way of life preserved and perpetuated in the service of a rigid, exacting and angry God. Behind a facade of false piety, there are sins and secrets in this place that could crush a vibrant young woman's passionate spirit. And here Ellen must find the straight to endure, change, and grow in the all-pervading darkness that threatens to destroy everything she is and everyone she loves.", "title": "Vinegar Hill", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101911.Vinegar_Hill", "average": 3.37, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440121207l/101911.jpg", "reviews": 942, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58843.A_Manette_Ansay", "name": "A.
