And in this case, it is difficult, because I myself am still trying to understand why. The title, cover, and plot summary were flashing caution lights. A perusal of several reviews was not encouraging. Why, oh why, did I not heed the warnings? If I am going to be honest, it came down to these two points:1) I already had plans to attend an event with author, Tasha Alexander. As the date approached, I learned the event would also feature Lauren Willig. I generally dislike \u201ccombo\u201d events as I feel obligated to read both authors. Otherwise, I sit in the audience feeling immensely guilty - as though the neglected author is singling me out and begging/accusing me with their eyes. \u201cWhy her and not me? What\u2019s wrong with me, Cassy? Why didn\u2019t I deserve a chance?\"Lesson learned: I need to stop being such a softy.2) Lauren\u2019s biography bragged that she attended Harvard Law School. I thought to myself, \u201cHuh, Harvard. She must be pretty smart. And smart people write smart books, right?\u201dLesson learned: You should not use alma maters as a reliable predictor of quality. Oh well, I read it. And as you have likely deduced, I didn\u2019t care for it. The fundamentals of the plot were good: spies running around 19th century Paris. Where it went wrong for me was the tone. I prefer my historical fiction novels to take themselves somewhat seriously. This book, however, had the flippancy of modern day chick lit. Lauren was constantly going for the obvious joke and squeezing in cutesy asides. And I was annoyed more often than charmed.Occasional pouts of levity might have been fine. Yet Lauren never varied the tone and it felt incompatible with the action at times. For example, when Amy\u2019s love interest, Richard is captured and taken to the police headquarters to be tortured, Amy rushes to his aide and you run into lines such as,Take him to the extra-special interrogation chamber!and[Richard] was beginning to feel uncomfortably peripheral to his own rescue\u2026Hell, he\u2019d never be able to show his face in male company again. He might as well resign his membership in his clubs and join a sewing circle.I\u2019m sorry, but shouldn\u2019t these be serious, tension-filled moments? Instead I was rolling my eyes at the mention of the extra-special torture chamber and sewing circles. The girly vibe was, however, most welcome during the event with Lauren and Tasha. They are apparently good friends and it was amusing to follow the genuine, relaxed banter between one another. They were also open and friendly with the mostly female audience. They claimed their exuberance could be partly attributed to their having spent the entire afternoon gabbing in the hotel restaurant and ordering Diet Coke after Diet Coke after Diet Coke\u2026 Lauren, in particular, was very chatty. (I almost felt bad for Tasha, because Lauren talked so fast and abundantly that Tasha had trouble getting a word in.) And as normal, meeting the author helped me better understand their book. Girly author = girly book. If you aren't a genre purist, you might like this mesh of historical fiction, romance, and chick lit. With the right mindset, it could be fun. There is much swooning over the dreamy male spy, plus a couple steamy scenes. It just didn't work for me."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876124-bonnie", "userReview": "This is what I get for being lulled into a false sense of security by a nice cover and an interesting premise. This book promised to be a historical fiction with a bit of mystery thrown in. Instead, it turned out to be a banal bodice-ripping generically bad Regency romance novel. I could deal with the fact that the \u201cmodern\u201d parts of the book were completely unnecessary. I could even deal with the fact that the way people spoke/acted in the 19th century parts and the modern parts were exactly the same (i.e., wildly anachronistic for the Regency parts). I could even deal with the fact that it was impossible to tell how much modern-day scholar Eloise knew of the story the reader learned, considering many of the details would NOT find their way into the diaries/letters that she was supposedly reading (and why oh why did Willig just not do the 19th century bits in letter/diary form?). I could deal with all these things IF the writing, characters, and plot were any good. Unfortunately, those three things were so horribly done that the previous details I mentioned only added insult to injury. First of all, the two main heroines (present day Eloise and Regency Amy) were Chaotic Stupid. When the main trait of your characters is Too Stupid To Live you know there is something wrong. The love interest, Lord Richard, besides having a lame secret identity name (the Purple Gentian...yeah, I know) was also dumb beyond belief. And this was the man who apparently outwitted the French Secret Service for years. Either the French Secret Service is even more incompetent than the average villainous mook, or Lord Richard survived on sheer luck. Why do I hate this book? Let me count the ways: Everyone acts like a 12 year old, and not a particularly bright 12 year old. There is so much stomping, foot stamping and door slamming that I almost wanted to keep count to see how many times Willig managed to fit it in. And these are supposed to be grown adults. And they do dumbass things, like Lord Richard and Amy both ending up in the bad guy's room for secret spy reasons and instead of being quiet and stealthy and getting in and out fast...they make out on the bed and then stand around shouting at each other until the bad guy and his guards surround them. SERIOUSLY, HOW IS LORD RICHARD STILL ALIVE?!?!? Especially given the fact that he mostly spends the book whining, leering at the heroine, not being particularly stealthy, allowing himself to be tailed without ever figuring it out, and having the heroine, her cousin and her governess figure out his true identity in about a week. HOW HAS NO ONE ELSE BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT THEN?!?!? Truly, I think in this parallel timeline where the Scarlet Pimpernel was a real person, a dreaded Stupidity Epidemic swept through France and Britain, rendering both the Continent and the Isles thick as concrete. Amy was perhaps one of the most annoying heroines I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. She is the main culprit of the stomping, juvenile behavior. She actually has an argument with Lord Richard that devolves into \"I'm not speaking to you!\" \"How mature!\" \"Shut up!\" \"You just spoke to me!\" \"That doesn't count!\" thing I did with my brothers when I was about 8. Plus, she made a point to get a job tutoring Napoleon's stepdaughter in English so she could have an in with the government...and then the entire subplot was dropped as we never saw the stepdaughter again or heard anything of any tutoring. AND she was one of those heroines who despite being a privileged, sheltered girl has no concern for propriety at all and seems to willfully try to ruin her reputation every opportunity she gets, despite the fact that at the time a ruined reputation was actually A Serious Business that could shame not only her but ALSO her family (including her cousins). I mean, this girl nearly loses her virginity on a BOAT with a poor hired guy ROWING HER AND HER PARAMOUR on the Seine. Sex in public with a witness! Does the girl have no shame? You don't think she'd feel at all awkward by the fact that, you know, someone WAS WATCHING HER? I know it's hard to think logically when you're in the middle of getting hot and heavy with a guy you like, but at the very least it should've given her a moment of pause. But, no, it barely registers. Not to mention the scene where her governess upbraids Napoleon as if he's a naughty child and isn't even thrown in jail for what would've been considered treason. The only person who showed ANY intelligence at all was cousin Jane. Basically she was the only one that ever figured anything out without having it dropped in her lap and she used the common sense that God gave her instead of acting like a spoiled, selfish brat. You'd think that an author who was getting a PhD in history at Harvard could write a decent historical novel. You'd be wrong. This is the epitome of bad writing, idiotic characters, plot contrivances, and no apparent historical research."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47239-tara", "userReview": "I would rather like my two hours back that I spent on this book. It's not that it was bad, rather, it had an intriguing premise, but the past/future aspects were poorly merged, the part of the story set in present day was absolutely unsatisfying and the Georgian smut felt out of place, perhaps because of the highly formal nature she tried to give the characters.The lesson to be learned there is you can't do Pride and Prejudice with an R rating."}, {"userName": "Lisa Kay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2459470-lisa-kay", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/627337-tina", "userReview": "I was bitterly disappointed in this book. Given the quality hard cover, the lovely cover art and the blurb, I was expecting something that strives to be Heyer or Austen. I would have been happy with something that fell along the lines of Tasha Alexander or Deanna Raybourne. Heck, I would counted myself lucky if the book had been vaguely reminiscent of Mary Balogh or Julia Quinn. Instead I got something that fell far short of all of those.Instead of sparkling wit of Heyer and the mannered prose of Austen, I got a by the numbers, derivative, cliche historical romance novel that (weirdly) also wanted to be modern chick lit and a rollicking spy adventure as well.The heroine Amy is a firm and permanent resident of the too stupid to live category. Seriously. This girl did one dumb thing after the other. Just from the glimpse of a black cloak, she believes she has discovered the identity of the Purple Gentian (a famous spy a la the Scarlet Pimpernel). So she sends the man a note to meet her at night in a deserted park. So very smart! The fact that the real Purple Gentian happened to coincidentally have a conversation with the other man (who was a leering jerk) where he learns about the assignation, is what largely saves the stupid twit from being raped.But Amy is not the only dull knife in the drawer. For a super spy who has eluded capture for years, Richard is also remarkably inept. First he has pretty much told his entire family his secret identity. Isn't that like rule number 1 in the spy handbook? You don't tell anyone your identity especially not your mother and your younger sister. And then there is the scene where he and Amy are in the apartment of the head of Napoleon's secret police to steal papers. Instead of getting in and getting out, they have a conversation on issues of love trust and almost end up making love right then and there. Sigh. There are not words enough...And there were many more moments where I just rolled my eyes so hard. There was also a very modern feel to the language that struck me as out of place. While not overtly anachronistic in word usage, the tone was just off. It was too droll, too arch. I got the impression that author was doing this on purpose and trying to let us in on the joke. But imo, it failed miserably.Also, I could pretty much predict how the H/h were going to act and react to each other. This book was just stuffed with romance novel obviousness. Not one character did anything surprising or unpredictable. Actually, I retract that last statement a bit. This book was not a total waste. Jane, the heroine's cousin was actually an excellent character. She had all the brains, wit and composure the heroine should have had. Had Jane been the heroine of this novel and been allowed to retain her character this may have been a much different story.And I do have to admit the book was funny in some places. Toward the end of the novel the scene where Richard's family shows up and wants to meet Amy was a entertaining.But even with those one or two positive things, the book overall was still a big disappointment.I can't recommend."}, {"userName": "Loni", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/973436-loni", "userReview": "Okay, this book started out so cute! It's a great mix of historical fiction (granted with several liberties taken), chick lit, and a cute little Superman/Lois Lane man-in-a-mask love story. It was just a fun read. Until the sex scene... So I don't recommend it. In hind sight, although it was cute, it also was very shallow to begin with. I HATE it when fun books turn out to be dirty when you're already half way through. Does anyone know if there's a website out there that gives tv/movie type ratings for books? That's always been my biggest trepidation with reading is stumbling across foul language, violence and pornographic material. For me reading is sometimes way more graphic than seeing something in a movie. If there isn't a website like that out there, would you check a monitoring system like that before you read a book?"}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9371994-allison", "userReview": "If you go into this expecting historical fiction with Napoleonic spy action, you\u2019re likely to be disappointed. I was expecting more of a historical mystery / spy adventure, but soon caught on and was able to adjust and enjoy it for what it is. And what it is, is a fairly typical fluffy Regency Romance, except that it\u2019s set in the French court and does have a dose of spies to make it more interesting. Confirming its status as a Romance series is the fact that the main characters change in each book.It's also very light on historical accuracy, but that didn't stop me from having fun reading it. It's purposely silly and far-fetched, and I do enjoy silly. So instead of being horrified at the liberties taken with the time period, I found it mostly fun. There were times when I found it a bit long-winded, though. And I still could have done with less of the romance, especially the sex scenes. I always feel that those scenes are out of place in a Regency novel - they drag something too modern into the historical setting.There\u2019s also a second story-line set in the present day about a woman who is researching the Pink Carnation for her dissertation. It looks like it will span the sequels as she discovers more about the past. It also looks like there will be a romance in her future. I thought the framing story was OK, but could have done without it. It made the book longer, and I'm not sure I liked being pulled out of the other story for this one. But I think it might grow on me as the series progresses. We\u2019ll see. I do intend to continue reading when I\u2019m in the mood for something silly, light and fluffy, with a bit of derring-do in the court of Napoleon."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane", "userReview": "Where I got the book: bought retail (yes! full price!) from my local indie bookstore at an author event.The plot: it's 1803 and Amy, who grew up dreaming of joining the Scarlet Pimpernel's league of daring rescuers, is on her way to France to join her brother. The Scarlet Pimpernel has retired, and now the Purple Gentian stands between England and the machinations of Napoleon, so naturally Amy wants to be on his team. She must not allow herself to be distracted by handsome Lord Richard Selwick...meanwhile, in the present day, graduate student Eloise is trying to solve the mystery of the identity of the Pink Carnation, and must not allow herself to be distracted by handsome Colin Selwick...Can a novel with as much gravitas as a herd of My Little Ponys gamboling amid clouds of pink cotton candy really be classified as historical fiction? I'm not saying that the settings aren't accurate enough and I couldn't catch Ms Willig out in any particular, but the tendency of the 1803 characters to lapse into decidedly 21st century speech with a chick lit flavor (and display some very un-1803 attitudes to sex and marriage) ensured I was kept well aware that this was pure historical-ish fantasy. And great fun at that, strangely enough, even though I had to work hard to keep from getting steamed up about the adverbs. Oh, the adverbs. Characters speak thrillingly, knowingly, bluntly, dourly...you get the picture. And if I had a penny for every clich\u00e9d phrase...this is definitely a young author's first go. And then there are the sex scenes (well, one and a half); oh gosh, words fail me. And darn it, somehow it works. Even the modern-day interjections, which are obviously intended to provide a framework for future books. As long as you're looking for a beach read, go ahead and enjoy; this is the historical fiction equivalent of a very fruity drink with an umbrella in it, and sometimes that just hits the spot. I won't say I loved this book, but it fit nicely into those moments when I wanted to read but was too tired to tax my brain with actual thought.

It was just complete and total crap. The thing that made me the most angry is that at the back of the book the author has a \"historical note\" where she talks about this garbage in light of its place in the \"historical fiction\" genre. Oh. My. Gosh. THERE WAS NOTHING HISTORICAL ABOUT IT! The Scarlet Letter is historical fiction. Cold Mountain is historical fiction. This, as I have already said, is crap. Mentioning Napoleon and the year 1803 does not make a book historical fiction. It makes it a crappy romance novel that mentions Napoleon and the year 1803. Oh, and p.s.: the Bastille was not around in 1803 (see pg. 137). It was demolished in 1789 and the stones were used to build a bridge, so a dramatic rescue of a prisoner held captive there really would not, unfortunately, have been dramatic or heroic at all. Who was this author's editor? She should get a refund. In addition to pathetically obvious anachronisms, the book featured a weak, obnoxious, and just all-around ridiculous main character and some of the most painful situational cliches that I have come across in years, such as the manly hero being rescued by his mother, complete with the whole, \"Mom! What are you doing here? This is so embarrassing!\" type dialog that just makes you cringe when you read it. Oh and yes, that is how he's rescued, and no, I don't even care that I just gave away a spoiler; hopefully it will deter you from reading the book yourself."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/985163-ann", "userReview": "Don't be fooled by the cover: this book is a romance novel pretending to be historical fiction. I was completely shocked when the first sex scene started (in a small boat on a river which was currently being rowed by someone else! I kept thinking I had missed something and the rower had left the boat, but no). Along with the requisite sex, there are also the requisite shallow protagonists. I kept thinking there must be more to the characters (because I was duped by the cover!), but they really are cookie-cutter romance heroes. I was also bothered by the way the author physically describes women - it came across as such a masculine point of view, and that surprised me from a female author. I think the idea of this book is fun, and I've read that the next one is better than this, so I may give it a try (with plenty of skipping). Willig isn't necessarily a bad writer, and she's obviously smart, but she wants to remind us of that on every page (I was instantly annoyed that her bio mentioned that she was only 26 when she wrote the novel, and that she's going to law school and getting a Ph.D. at the same time. At Harvard.), and she also finds herself very clever, in the sort of \"all my girlfriends think I'm so funny and catty when we get together on Thursday nights for tapas and wine\" kind of way. Personally, I found the book unbelievably self-aware and self-congratulating, but maybe I wouldn't have if I hadn't read the author bio first.

Eloise Kelly is a klutzy, directionally challenged graduate student in history (not like anybody I know) who is trying to discover the identity of the Pink Carnation, a spy in the mode of the Scarlet Pimpernel. The key, she believes, may lie in Selwick Hall, the estate of another aristocratic spy, the Purple Gentian, aka Richard Selwick. When Mrs. Selwick-Alderly grants her access to a box full of family papers, letters and journals dating from the early 19th century, Eloise discovers the feisty and romantic Amy Balcourt, a wannabe spy in Napoleonic France. Will Amy live out her dream of joining the League of the Purple Gentian? Will Eloise discover the identity of the Pink Carnation? Is there romantic as well as professional fulfillment for either young woman? Clearly you'll have to read the novel to see.This book combines multiple genres, including historical romance, chick lit, and swashbuckler, with wildly entertaining if somewhat unbalanced results. Amy's story is the one which receives the full treatment here; to find out what happens to Eloise, I suspect we may need to read the other books in the series (I believe there may be three or four). I was a bit surprised, given that Eloise learned Amy's story through letters---there is the mention of a couple diaries as well---that this section of the novel was written as a straight third person narrative, and not in epistolary fashion. It strained my credibility a bit, as did the omniscient narrator, who often gave us Amy and Richard Selwick's perspectives on events at the same time. There were a few times when the dialogue felt a bit anachronistic, though this may have been done for humorous effect and was not overly distracting. Overall, though, this book took me back to the days of my misspent youth, when I loved historical fiction, Zorro, and movies starring Errol Flynn. I love that you can tell that characters like each other because of how rude they are when they first meet, and I love that Willig has peopled Napoleonic France with a plethora of dashing, florally named spies. I particularly love that Eloise has chosen her dissertation topic because of a romantic fascination with men with masks.

It was humorous and cute. This book follows Amy, a wannabe spy adventurer, who tries to join The Purple Gentian's spy network against France shortly after the French Revolution. Of course nothing goes smoothly for the slightly dizzy heroine. The author combines historical fiction with fun chick lit, mostly focusing on Amy's romance with the Purple Gentian. I like both types of work so I enjoyed the combination.I read some reviews of this book on Amazon and found people either really liked it or absolutely hated it. Some comments I thought went way overboard included, \"Jane Austen would scream, you'd have to be braindead to like this, when I think of this book I throw up a little in my mouth, and my favorite, \"chick lit reflects poorly on women's literature, why isn't poorly written books written by men called dude's lit.\" Of course I had to reply back to some of these reviews with my own comments... like lighten up.When I think about books, there are two main categories I divide them up in: deep, soulful books usually filled with symbolism and themes and then there's escapism books. Now I am not going to lie, when it comes to the first category I don't always \"get\" the message of the book. I am disappointed after I read 400 pages of fancy, convoluted sentences that I can't relate to. But a lot of that is a reflection on me as a reader, not necessaily a reflection on the author. I tend to like stories focused on great characters, interesting plots, and unusual places or time periods, like \"The History of the Pink Carnation\".Pink Carnation is meant to be a light, fun book. If you don't expect Jane Austen or a historical book full of facts and dates, then I don't think you'll be disappointed. The book isn't perfect, even I noticed a few things that didn't make sense, i.e. when the true identity of the Purple Gentian is discovered and his family helps him escape, don't they all need to get the heck out of France.

Elle est fraiche, naturelle et a un regard d\u2019autod\u00e9rision sur elle-m\u00eame, un \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit que l\u2019on retrouve dans le livre.C\u2019est \u00e0 la fois un m\u00e9lange de sch\u00e9mas manich\u00e9ens avec plein de caricatures et de poncifs du genre (surtout au niveau des fran\u00e7ais qui sont les \u00ab grands m\u00e9chants \u00bb de l\u2019histoire et de l\u2019Histoire) qui pourraient nous faire bondir et lever les yeux au ciel, avec une second degr\u00e9s bien assum\u00e9, une pointe d\u2019anachronisme historique (qui en lisant les explications de l\u2019auteur \u00e0 la fin du livre sont parfaitement assum\u00e9es pour renforcer certaines intrigues) et surtout beaucoup d\u2019humour et de comique de situation. Et c\u2019est surtout je trouve un grand hommage aux films de cape et d\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e2ge d\u2019or Hollywoodien, aux supers h\u00e9ros (Zorro, Superman et co). Plus d\u2019une fois j\u2019ai eu en t\u00eate Errol Flynn bondissant dans tous les sens en collants verts pour pourfendre les m\u00e9chants et d\u00e9fendre sa dulcin\u00e9e.Le livre n\u2019est pas exempt de d\u00e9faut, c\u2019est un 1er tome avec souvent les d\u00e9fauts que les 1ers tomes peuvent avoir. Tout d\u2019abord la profusion de personnages qui s\u2019imposent \u00e0 nous et qui pourraient interf\u00e9rer avec les h\u00e9ros principaux. Sauf que c\u2019est tout le contraire, car pour moi c\u2019est une des richesses du livre. J\u2019adore ce genre de cacophonie o\u00f9 tout le monde se m\u00eale de tout. Les familles et les amis envahissants qui pourrissent l\u2019intimit\u00e9 des h\u00e9ros. Amy et Richard sont des gentils, c\u2019est rare maintenant dans la Romance de trouver de tels personnages. Pas de traumatisme d\u00fb \u00e0 leur enfance, enfin si Amy oui un peu puisqu\u2019elle a perdu ses parents \u00e0 cause de la R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise, d\u2019o\u00f9 son obsession \u00e0 renverser Napol\u00e9on, mais sinon ils sont sains et frais. Peut-\u00eatre un tantinet enfantins et l\u00e9gers mais c\u2019est ce qui fait leur charme. Heureusement qu\u2019ils ont les amis et la famille pour leur pr\u00eater main forte. Amy est \u00e0 la fois lucide et compl\u00e8tement na\u00efve, un personnage de caract\u00e8re mais qui se laisse trop entrainer par son fichu caract\u00e8re. On va dire qu\u2019elle fonce d\u2019abord et qu\u2019elle r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit apr\u00e8s. Elle est aussi compl\u00e8tement illogique et s\u2019illusionne sur ces propres capacit\u00e9s. Je pense qu\u2019elle s\u2019imagine tr\u00e8s bien ressembler \u00e0 un lion, alors qu\u2019en fait elle ressemblerait c\u2019est un chat. A c\u00f4t\u00e9 Richard est compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9pass\u00e9 par ce petit bout de femme qui d\u00e9boule dans sa vie et va compl\u00e8tement le chambouler. Ils sont attendrissants tous les deux, on dirait deux enfants de maternelle qui n\u2019ont rien trouv\u00e9 de mieux que se tirer les cheveux pour faire comprendre qu\u2019ils se plaisent. A c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9galement nous avons Jane la pond\u00e9r\u00e9, Jane la lucide, Jane un des rare personnages dans l\u2019histoire \u00e0 poss\u00e9der un cerveau et \u00e0 savoir s\u2019en servir et bien s\u00fbr n\u2019oublions pas Miss Gwenn sorte d\u2019amazone qui fait m\u00eame peur \u00e0 Napol\u00e9on lui-m\u00eame.Au d\u00e9but j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu d\u00e9stabilis\u00e9e par la profusion de d\u00e9tails et toutes les descriptions que l\u2019auteur nous fait pour chaque sc\u00e8ne. Mais ensuite j\u2019ai compris que chaque d\u00e9tail comptait et qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas l\u00e0 par hasard. Vous savez c\u2019est un peu comme ces structures en dominos. Elles prennent le temps de se mettre en place, de petits carr\u00e9s sans importance qui au final mis bout \u00e0 bout peuvent d\u00e9clencher une r\u00e9action en chaine.Je dois dire que je m\u2019attendais quand m\u00eame \u00e0 plus d\u2019action, plus d\u2019aventure, \u00e0 un rythme plus soutenu. C\u2019est assez lent comme narration. A ce niveau-l\u00e0 j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu d\u00e9stabilis\u00e9e au d\u00e9but. L\u2019action se situe plus dans les joutes verbales et les coups d\u2019ombrelle de Miss Gwen. Le livre est tr\u00e8s visuel, comme je l'ai dit plus haut nous sommes souvent face \u00e0 du comique de situation : les personnages glissent, tombent, crient, se bagarrent etc. Si on ne rentre pas dedans je pense que l\u2019on pourrait passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019histoire. Les ficelles sont celles des h\u00e9ros masqu\u00e9es, compl\u00e8tement \u00e9cul\u00e9es et faciles. L\u00e0 aussi si on n\u2019adh\u00e8re pas on pourrait trouver \u00e7a compl\u00e8tement ridicule. Pour ma part ce ne fut pas le cas et donc je peux dire que je me suis r\u00e9gal\u00e9e.C\u2019est un livre frustrant, il en dit trop ou pas assez. D\u2019abord avec la double narration. J\u2019ai beaucoup parl\u00e9 d\u2019Amy et de Richard mais n\u2019oublions pas Colin (qui a tout d\u2019un Darcy du XX\u00e8me si\u00e8cle) et Elo\u00efse qui font partie int\u00e9grante de l\u2019histoire. Frustrant parce que leur histoire \u00e0 eux ne sera donn\u00e9e qu\u2019avec parcimonie. Frustrant parce que malgr\u00e9 la longueur du livre finalement je suis rest\u00e9e un peu sur ma faim. La derni\u00e8re sc\u00e8ne dans la chambre extrasp\u00e9ciale \u00e9tait jouissive, peut-\u00eatre l\u2019action qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un plus \u00e0 certains moments de l\u2019histoire. On quitte un peu brutalement Amy et Richard et finalement leur moment d\u2019intimit\u00e9 sur le bateau \u00e9tait presque de trop.Frustrant finalement parce que il manque encore pleins d\u2019autres livres avant de suivre les aventures de Jane ou de Miss Gwen. Il me tarde de retrouver tous ces personnages auxquels je me suis attach\u00e9e mais vu que pour le moment il n\u2019y en a eu que 3 de traduits sur 12, je vais fatalement \u00eatre frustr\u00e9e."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/225957-nicole", "userReview": "This was one of those books that I found easier to read once I gave up any expectations I started with, and I will confess that it did redeem itself in my eyes by the end. It was a cute but predictable story about the hijinks surrounding the doings and identities of the preposterously-named Purple Gentian and Pink Carnation, not that the names really mattered that much. We mostly follow the dense Amy about as she desperately but naively tries to enter the world of espionage. Both she and her love interest were pretty forgettable to me, as was Eleanor, or whatever her names was, who was a guide through the modern frame of the novel as she tries to discover the identity of the Pink Carnation through what seem to be the most bizarrely detailed accounts in diaries and letters. At least the author was sensible in her choice of the identity of the Pink Carnation, but she had me worried for a long time. The book didn't get better until the author proved to me that she had some modicum of sense."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83319-christina", "userReview": "Choosing a light read is a tricky business. It's like icing on a cake - too little, and all you have is cake; too much, and you're overwhelmed with fluff and sugar. I picked up this book because I wanted to read something with no murders in it, and besides, Napoleonic spy capers with women! Fun stuff! Surely this was the right amount of icing. I was even willing to overlook the fact that the contemporary heroine, Eloise, was the type that knew what brand her boots were and just had to mention it. I was willing to award this book ALL the breaks, just because I wanted something that would not rip my heart out.Sadly, as other readers have noticed, there's very little capering in this book. Minimal caper. It's a Regency romance novel, interspersed with a few chapters of a contemporary researcher, who, in spite of being a PhD student smart enough to con a committee into sending her overseas, is the kind of person who will, after a man is rude to her once, be repeatedly rude back, even in the face of his preternatural patience. Have I mentioned this is someone who has something she wants? He is! She will also hate women who are more polished than she is and embarrass herself through repeated clumsiness. In short, she's a familiar romantic comedy type, but I'd have to seriously question Harvard's admission process if she existed in real life. If it sounds as if I thought the contemporary pieces were the worst part of this book, oh, think again. They were actually a bit of a relief, although both storylines featured proportionately equal amounts of \"endearing\" clumsiness. I kind of wish I'd done a word count for \"ouch,\" \"urgh,\" and \"ow.\" They were numerous. The historical parts were MUCH worse. My poor husband, reading in the same room with me, was subjected to a lot of moans and groans on my part, sarcastic commentary such as \"oh, good, he has piercing green eyes, I was worried he wouldn't,\" and the moment when I said \"no, wrong. WRONG!\" That, I'm pretty sure, was when Amy, the nauseating heroine of the historical bits, hears the Purple Gentian reference something she has only told to his alter ego, Richard, and decides that it MUST mean that he's her true love, fated to be with her. Not that he actually is Richard. This was, however, also the scene where I discovered my new favorite line in literature, \"the moist thrust of the Purple Gentian's tongue.\" There was so much bosom-heaving and ass-checking-out that I was rooting really hard for the leads to just do it already so the rest of us could be spared them lusting after each other. Since clearly the author wasn't going to do us all a favor and kill them off, the least she could do was make them stop gazing for a hot second. There were secondary characters I DIDN'T totally hate, but the leads I did. I was very sorry we had to read about them the whole damn time.The writing was, oh, how do I put this? Bad. The writing was bad. I feel a little harsh saying this, because clearly this author was enjoying herself as she wrote. She liked her characters and I'm sure was chuckling as she wrote some of the lines I found so vomit-worthy. But the writing was really bad. The dialogue in the historical pieces would throw in some era-appropriate terms, but otherwise they talked like the contemporary characters (I can't say they talked or acted like real people at either end). They said \"um\" a lot. Sometimes when they were speaking French, which I happen to know isn't something you SAY in French (3 semesters of college French speaking, here, she says, buffing nails on shirt).Why, then, is this book two stars rather than one? Mostly because the packaging is so misleading. It seems unfair to rate the book on what it's being billed as, rather than what it is. If it had been billed as a Regency romance I would never have read it in the first place, but at least I would have known more or less what to expect. But since I DID get conned into reading a Regency romance, it did give me an opportunity to have a think about the genre. Its existence implies that there are in the world women (definitely a genre aimed at women) who get all hot and bothered at the idea of being bossed around and scolded. Women who think it would be sexy as hell to have a guy with piercing eyes (always piercing eyes, or a piercing gaze if you're fancy/a better writer) and a \"face like a thunderstorm\" demand \"what were you thinking, you little fool? Don't you know you could have been hurt?\" before sweeping her into his arms and asking brokenly (usually brokenly, sometimes softly or \"with sudden and unexpected tenderness\") \"Don't you know what it would do to me if something happened to you?\" Followed, natch, by the passionate kiss as he gives in to his feelings. Thinking about this stuff now, I am actually really intrigued. I have to admit this does nothing for me - I'm not into being patronized or having my intellect called into question, although I'm also not impetuous and nor do I bounce with frustration so maybe I'm not really a heroine either - but ARE there people who really find this hot escapism? Is being scolded a minor subset of BDSM culture? I WANT TO KNOW! Because I'm so confused by this idea! I can kind of get the idea of fantasizing about being a damsel in distress - because I think most people like the idea of being valued so much by someone who would drop everything to come save you if you needed it. Who doesn't want a guy who has your back? But a guy who saves you and then yells at you about it? Is this really what does it for some people? I AM SO CURIOUS.Anyway, there's a whole series of these books, so clearly the author got in some more practice and may have improved since then. The book was kind of fun to read, in the spirit of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and if you're into heaving bosoms and male assholes who can't stop staring at your heaving bosoms because they're so in lust/love with you and female assholes who yell at you for maybe making fun of them that one time, well! I have a book for you! But it also contains the phrase \"the moist thrust of the Purple Gentian's tongue.\" I think we can all agree that this is wrong."}, {"userName": "Nan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754607-nan", "userReview": "This is a genre romance novel with pretensions of grandeur.I was intrigued by this book because of it's duel format. It features a Harvard Ph.D. candidate in history researching the famous (in her world at least!) Pink Carnation, a British spy during the Napoleonic Wars. Eloise, the student, travels to London after a bad break up and decides to research primary sources on the Pink Carnation. The novel opens with her in a slight jam--she's crushed in an overcrowded Tube ride, has spilled coffee on herself, and discovers that it's raining and she doesn't have an umbrella. All of this makes her a truly hapless sight when so goes to interview a descendant of the Purple Gentian (a spy that inspired our Carnation).Her host is a nice old woman and immediately gives Eloise access to private family papers.And that's where the book goes downhill.Eloise is apparently reading journals and letters, but that's not what readers see. Instead, we are simply taken into the story of Amy Balcourt and Richard Selwick (who happens to be the Purple Gentian). Their story is a very typical romance novel. Amy is returning to France for the first time since she left it during the Terror. She's been living with her English relatives for the last 15 years, plotting and planning how she could help the famous British spies--the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian--restore the monarchy in France. Or at least expel the Republicans. Or Napoleon. In any event, she wants to help. Her father was killed by the guillotine, and she has a powerful hatred of the current French government. Richard has posing as a French sympathizer, working as their head of antiquities, all the while spying for his native England. Amy, of course, doesn't know this, and is repelled to learn that such an attractive young man could work for the side of the devil. Richard, in turn, is drawn to Amy. He knows her brother is involved in something underhanded, and in his attempt to investigate, he stumbles into Amy late at night. She doesn't know who he is due to the mask, but her hero worship of the Gentian leads to a slightly compromising situation. Cue the rest of a standard romance novel involving mistaken identity.This novel would have worked so much better if readers had been able to read the same letters and journals Eloise was reading. We could have learned the story as she did. Instead, Eloise has access to different information than the reader. For a novel that's based around the idea of historical research, it doesn't read as being very authentic. Amy and her friends are unrealistic, and the graphic sexual encounters do not read as anything that would appear in a young lady's journal. Considering Richard's dangerous occupation, he would have been unlikely to keep a journal of his encounters with her either.Further, I would have liked to see more of Eloise. I didn't like her as a character--she was too much the cliched chick lit heroine--but with only roughly four chapters to her credit, she was never able to properly establish her identity as a character or as a researcher. Sadly, the framing device of Eloise's narrative seemed like a pathetic attempt to elevate the book out of it's genre--the historical romance. Both the size of the book--a trade paperback--and the period artwork cover would seem to imply that it is more than a genre romance, but that's simply not the case.I will admit that I enjoyed Amy & Richard's story. It was fun and trashy, and there were actually a few surprises. Other than the mustache-twirling villain, the supporting characters were delightfully madcap. Unfortunately, all of the characters were smarter than Amy, which didn't work well. They were able to see through Richard's subterfuges before Amy, allowing her to make an ass of herself repeatedly while they looked on knowingly. Gwen the chaperone was perhaps the most inspired character--but she was also almost a caricature. If you're looking for a fun romance without pretensions, pass this book by. If you just want a trashy book set in the Napoleonic Wars, and you're willing to overlook the Eloise sections, have at it. I picked up the second book in the bookswap at the same time as I grabbed this one. I will probably continue with the series through that book alone. Unless the modern storyline develops further, I simply don't see enough her to elevate it above the usual genre romances and into a permanent place in my library."}, {"userName": "Pamela(AllHoney)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/884792-pamela-allhoney", "userReview": "The first in Lauren Willig's Pink Carnation series.

If it isn\u2019t that demmed, elusive pimpernel!\u201d The Scarlet Pimpernel has always been a favorite of mine, the book, the musical, and both the movie versions\u2013starring Leslie Howard (1934) and Anthony Andrews (1982). Perusing several historical fiction blogs, I was intrigued to learn that Lauren Willig has created a whole spin-off series from the original Pimpernel books by Baroness Orczy.The premise of the first book, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation, is that after Percy Blakeney retired, a young nobleman named Lord Richard Selwick\u2013formerly part of the Pimpernel\u2019s league\u2013picked up where Percy left off. Creating the nom de plume of The Purple Gentian, Richard Selwick poses as a student of the antiquities, spying on Napoleon and giving much needed intelligence to the British War Office.Amy Balcourt, whose father was guillotined during the Terror, has spent her life dreaming of joining these spies, first the Pimpernel and then the Gentian. She journeys to France with her cousin Jane (and a formidable elderly chaperone who uses her parasol as a weapon) to see if she can find clues leading to the Purple Gentian\u2019s identity. On the passage over, the ladies are thrown into the company of Lord Richard Selwick. An instant attraction springs up between Amy and Richard, but when she learns that he unpatriotically associates with the French regime for the purpose of studying Egyptian artifacts (his cover identity), she immediately and emphatically despises him.The remainder of the book is the story of Richard Selwick falling in love with Amy Balcourt as she falls in love with both him and with the Purple Gentian, unaware that they are the same person. Lauren Willig has an excellent command of description and witty repartee. Her breezy style is more characteristic of Georgette Heyer than Baroness Orczy and fits well with the time period.The idea behind the book is an interesting one. Unfortunately, The Secret History of the Pink Carnation had two main flaws. First, the plot was incredibly implausible. Somehow, all of the other characters in the book know/guess who the Purple Gentian is with remarkably little trouble while M. Delaroche, the French agent in charge of capturing the Gentian, is hopelessly thrown off track for most of the book. Secret papers are continually unguarded in unlocked studies, and featherbrained young ladies make the most intelligent deductive leaps imaginable. Spying seems like the easiest thing in the world.The second failing of the book was that it seemed far more concerned with human anatomy than it was with history. You can finish the book having very little idea of what Napoleon was actually trying to do, while having a very vivid idea of what the main characters look like in a state of undress. In Baroness Orczy\u2019s book, Percy and Marguerite\u2019s relationship is very romantic without having explicit sex scenes. Lauren Willig doesn\u2019t know when to shut the bedroom door and let her characters have some privacy. I also don\u2019t think that Percy Blakeney would really have approved of the Purple Gentian spending half his time staring at Amy\u2019s derriere or wishing that she would jump up and down again so he could watch her breasts jiggle. If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be \u201ctitillating,\u201d which was disappointing since this book had potential to be a lot more than a grocery store novel."}, {"userName": "Nazl\u0131can", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14024532-nazl-can", "userReview": "\u00d6zel sorgu odas\u0131ndan ka\u00e7\u0131\u015f ve \u0130svi\u00e7re alt\u0131nlar\u0131n\u0131n \u00e7al\u0131nmas\u0131 gibi iki kilit olay ge\u00e7i\u015ftirilmese 5 y\u0131ld\u0131z\u0131 hak eden bir kitapt\u0131."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/232072-kelly", "userReview": "First and foremost, let me say how terribly delighted I am with Lauren Willig. Not only for delighting me with her own story and characters and lines, but also for all the homages she makes to others of my favorite authors, such as this nod to Austen on page 244: \"It is a truth universally acknowledged that one only comes up with clever, cutting remarks long after the other party is happily slumbering away.\" And this wink at Shakespeare on page 247: \"Out, out damned ex!\" There are more (too many to count), and they make me positively gleeful. I giggled and laughed aloud more times than I can count whilst reading this book, all the while engrossed in the book or, as my friend Angela can attest, eager to return to it.The book tells the story of modern-day researcher Eloise Kelly, who has gone to England in order to do research for her dissertation on various spy heroes who worked for England in the war against the French. These heroes include the well-known Scarlet Pimpernel, the Purple Gentian, and the Pink Carnation. The identities of the first two are common knowledge, and Eloise is on a quest to find out the identity of the gentleman known as the Pink Carnation (her particular favorite of the spies). Eloise meets Mrs. Arabella Selwick-Alderly, who provides her with family papers that identify the Pink Carnation. She also provides her with an introduction to Colin Selwick, Mrs. Selwick-Alderly's handsome-but-dour nephew. Oh the squeeish fun of that particular relationship.Most of the pages of the book are concerned, however, with relating the tale of Amy Balcourt and Richard Selwick (the Purple Gentian), a star-crossed couple who met in 1802 en route to France from England after the Treaty of Amiens had been signed. (Which promptly reminded me to do research on the Treaty of Amiens for my Jane poem - confluence/message from the Universe, see?) Amy, whose father lost his head to the guillotine, has always wanted to become a spy for England, in which adventure she is joined by her calm and methodical cousin, Jane. Amy, Jane and the most awesome chaperone ever, Miss Gwen, are on their way to stay with Amy's brother, Edouard de Balcourt in Paris. Richard Selwick is likewise on his way (back) to Paris to conduct further espionage missions, only to find himself saddled with the company of three women on his \"private\" packet to Calais and, indeed, in his carriage to Paris as well.

It seems that everyone on the planet other than me had read it, so I thought I'd give it a go.I love the whole Scarlet Pimpernel thing. I've not yet read the book, but the original movie with Leslie Howard and Raymond Massey is one of my absolute faves, and I'm really not into that whole black-and-white movie thing. I also have an unforgivable weakness for the Carry On.. team's Black Fingernail homage, but that's another thing..So what did I like?- This is one witty book. The dialogue (both for the first-person \"guide\") and the historical action is really good. A couple of times I felt the historical part was getting a bit too modern, but not such that it annoyed me.- Although I thought the contemporary parts with Eloise and Colin would really annoy me, they didn't, and I enjoyed them just as much as the historical bits.- There are some wonderful secondary characters, that just leap off the page at you in glorious technicolor (not telling who they are). Some of them have totally insignificant roles, but they are wonderful anyway.What didn't I like so much?- The heroine, while fun and heroic, was distinctly too close to the \"annoying\" category for me. She struck me as someone who never actually grew up emotionally beyond the age of about 7 or 8, and I couldn't get over that.- The hero was OK. I was actually rooting for him to realize how much a twirp Amy was and take off with Jane instead.- About 75% of the way through, the book suddenly involved the invasion of the hero's incredibly irritating and disgustingly jolly family, and quite frankly it felt like I was reading Notting Hill with fancy dresses and tight trousers. What a really annoying, self-obsessed group of people. Nasty.So, for me the secondary characters were far more fun than the rather puerile heroine and the hero's family should have stayed in Blighty rather than trekked across the Channel, but I'll probably read the next in the series to give it another chance.3 stars."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Osterman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/745257-jennifer-osterman", "userReview": "I am all for comedic books and light reads, and regency romances...but this one is just plain silly. Based on the premise, I expected a tale of intrigue, romance and danger. What I got was a tale of idiocy, sex and bumbling. The present-day Harvard student and the 1803 \"well-bred\" lady who traipses about like a street urchin and practically loses her virginity on a canal boat in front of a boatman without even a second thought think the same, speak the same and act the same. The only reason that this book can be said to be set in 1803 is because Amy didn't have an airplane or a car, and because the author kept beating us over the head with famous people of the time with whom the heroine could interact (One of whom she admittedly fudged into the story a year too early). I felt throughout the book as though the author doubted my ability to understand her and therefore had to simplify things to the point of inanity. Although, this book got enough good reviews that I suppose Ms. Willig has her audience. I certainly won't hang around for the sequel!My suggestions to the author:1. Your readers are not 12-year-olds2. Read a book of Regency etiquette if you are going to write about it3. Don't lure your readers to your book by talking of intriguing subjects such as the Scarlet Pimpernel and then leave them hanging without the return on the promises it suggests.4. You lost me completely when the heroine said \"Argh\"I gave this two stars because I actually finished it, and because the author used the word \"Pulchitrudinous\" more than once, even if it was parodically."}], "description": "Deciding that true romantic heroes are a thing of the past, Eloise Kelly, an intelligent American who always manages to wear her Jimmy Choo suede boots on the day it rains, leaves Harvard's Widener Library bound for England to finish her dissertation on the dashing pair of spies the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian. What she discovers is something the finest historians have missed: a secret history that begins with a letter dated 1803. Eloise has found the secret history of the Pink Carnation the most elusive spy of all time, the spy who single-handedly saved England from Napoleon's invasion.The Secret History of the Pink Carnation, a wildly imaginative and highly adventurous debut, opens with the story of a modern-day heroine but soon becomes a book within a book. Eloise Kelly settles in to read the secret history hoping to unmask the Pink Carnation's identity, but before she can make this discovery, she uncovers a passionate romance within the pages of the secret history that almost threw off the course of world events. How did the Pink Carnation save England? What became of the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian? And will Eloise Kelly find a hero of her own?", "title": "The Secret History of the Pink Carnation\n      \n          (Pink Carnation #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84351.The_Secret_History_of_the_Pink_Carnation", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442617435l/84351.jpg", "reviews": 2050, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14469.Lauren_Willig", "name": "Lauren Willig"}], "type": ["Romance", "Historical", "Mystery", "Historical", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84351.The_Secret_History_of_the_Pink_Carnation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6580603-the-secret-history-of-the-pink-carnation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28261100-la-myst-rieuse-histoire-de-l-oeillet-rose", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/532074.The_Secret_History_of_the_Pink_Carnation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/277258.La_historia_secreta_del_Clavel_Carmes_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397844.The_Masque_of_the_Black_Tulip", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25802.The_Deception_of_the_Emerald_Ring", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1363577.The_Seduction_of_the_Crimson_Rose", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3701590-the-temptation-of-the-night-jasmine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15701533-the-ashford-affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26813208-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
