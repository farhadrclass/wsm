I like the premise stated in the title, which is emphasized throughout the book. The Reconstruction period was brutal, and I'm not sure this could have actually happened. However, it's a book of fiction, so perhaps I shouldn't be expecting history. It has a good moral message and is a easy read.

A lot happened in this book. The two girls are still trying to make everyone think adults are still around, but Katies, whose family owns the plantation, had two loans at the Bank and she had to find some way to pay them off. Mayme (the once black slave) saw that the cotton was blooming decided that they would try to pick the cotton.in the last book. In this book, a black Livery worker from town, his name is Henry, came for a visit to see what they were up to and noticed the graves of Katies parents and two brothers and asked about them. At this point, he was the only one they trusted to know the truth. He decided to help the girls pick the cotton, but then the rains came and flooded the fields and all the cotton was destroyed. They were able to pay off one loan, but still had the other one to pay. They could still lose Rosewood Plantation if the second loan wasn't paid. They knew Katies Uncle Ward (whom they think is dead) had struck it rich in California and knew the gold may be somewhere on the property. Some men kept coming bye asking about it, but the girls didn't know where the gold was or even if there really was any. In the mean time, Katies Uncle, Templeton Daniels, came to visit. We find out in this book that Mayme or Mary Ann( that is her real name) is Templeton Daniels daughter. Like I said, a lot happens in this book. Katie finds the gold, the men come back for it with the intension of stealing it from them. One of the men, is the man, who killed both girls families. They have a shoot out and that man gets killed. The town is happy that he's dead, the gold pays off the second loan and the plantation is saved again. I can't wait to read the last book."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6147556-nancy", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book series very much. I haven't been able to find book 2 in our library, so I went on to book 3. Henry is a black man, who works as a blacksmith in town. He learns of the situation of the girls, working together to run the plantation. He does all he can to help the girls. He is the one who teaches them that: The color of your skin ain't the color of your heart. He tells them they most look deeper than a persons skin, to know if a person has a good heart. Someone reviewed the book as a fairy tell. It is historical fiction, and it does represent the feelings of people after the Civil War. Blacks were not treated well by many, and they had to struggle to learn how to fit into a southern life style. This is certainly an idealistic situation, where blacks and whites come together, and learn to work for the common good. I loved the series."}, {"userName": "Melody", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33669615-melody", "userReview": "The third book in the Shenandoah Sisters series lived up to my expectations!In this book, the same characters that I loved in the first two books are back, with some of them taking a more important role in the story. The new challenges and dangers the girls face are always interesting. I love how the story evolves. In fact, I feel like this series is just liked one long novel that has been cut into four books. I also really like how the characters grow in the story, and how the author incorporates just the right amount of faith and prayer in his books. Definitely making it to my favorites shelf! ;)And with the book ending on a cliffhanger, I'm really eager to read the conclusion of the series!"}, {"userName": "Karen & Gerard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/979933-karen-gerard", "userReview": "In this 3rd book of the Shenandoah Sisters series--The Color of Your Skin Ain't the Color of Your Heart by Michael Phillips, Katie and Mayme continue to fight to save the plantation with the help of Henry and his son, Jeremiah.

Will the bad men steal it from her? How many more will find out her secret that her parents have died and what will happen to the four girls living on their own?

Written about a time just after slaves were freed, two young girls, one white, one black, find themselves living on the plantation without parents because both of the girl's parents were killed during the war. The story line weaves through times of trying to plant cotton fields, deceiving the the townsfolk and bankers, while trying to hold onto the plantation so they won't be sent to state homes for the orphans. I also appreciate the way the chapters were short and the print was larger than many books. This fact makes me look for other Michael Phillips books.
