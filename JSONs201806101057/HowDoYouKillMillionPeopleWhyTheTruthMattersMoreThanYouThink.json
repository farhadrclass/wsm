I'm a fan of a lot of Andy Andrews' popular fiction, my personal favorite being The Traveler's gift, so when I stumbled upon this short book, I picked it up without hesitation. Now I don't regret reading this, or even feel like it was a waste of time, but the question I feel I must answer is this: Do I think this book is worth buying? Personally, no. I wouldn't classify this novel as a bad one, but I do think it's entirely too brief (I read this in about 20 mins) to go beyond anything superficial. There are a few sentences worth highlighting and ruminating upon, also some historical and political facts that I thought were pretty darn intriguing, but at its core this is purely a highly opinionated work designed to make you question your government, seek out and speak out truth, and also get more actively involved in politics (which I do agree is a brilliant, yet an oversimplified idea). But these are all ideologies that add more questions than it does answers. They are roughly mere talking points, and the content does little for personal empowerment or growth, and by no stretch would I label it as an eye opener. Included at the end of this novel is a short (and at times vague) question and answer with the author, and also reader questions to go over. If you can obtain a free copy from your local library then it wouldn't hurt to pick this book up, but if not, trust me you're not missing out on much.\"Those are probably the most famous words ever spoken on the subject of truth. Most of us accept that particular sentence at face value. It certainly resonates with our spirit. It just feels right. But what does it mean, really? And have you ever contemplated the meaning that comes to light by inverting this principle?If it is correct that \u201cyou shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free,\u201d then is it possible that if you don\u2019t know the truth, its absence can place you in bondage?\" --pg 2"}, {"userName": "Carol Smith", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5524197-carol-smith", "userReview": "Preachy claptrap.

Okay, maybe not so sweet. How can killing 11 million people be sweet? Andy Andrews doesn't sugarcoat this 112 page novella. Actually the meat of the book is all done in the first half. At the end of this short read you will come to realize that complacency is akin to murder. During the Holocaust it was the murder of 11 million people, 6 million were Jews. Today complacency is the murder of lifestyles, freedom and security and choices. Democracy is only as good as the voters and the leaders those voters put in power. Following and believing our politicians blindly can and did lead to the death of millions of people throughout our world at different times and in different countries.

Throughout history, victims of lies want to believe that THIS can't happen here or now because their neighbors and their leaders are civilized. Study the writings of the past and take a hard look at the world now and you will find that the human capacity for good and evil hasn't changed in written history. Reasons for seeking power rarely excludes personal benefit, but narcissists convincing their victims otherwise is almost a proverb. The founders understood that over 2 centuries ago, and tried to limit power (including their own), but many expected the experiment to be short-lived. People want to believe that their leaders take from one and give to another to make things fair. Because perfection is impossible, retaining personal liberty has always resulted in maximum \"fairness\" throughout history.

I would classify this book more as an essay than a novel. Since I bought if for my kindle I didn't realize it was such a tiny book. Although tiny and can be read in about an hour, it would make a huge book club discussion. The underlying theme of this book is how we are lied to by our politicians especially while campaigning for election. The example the author uses is the tactics that Hitler used in killing 11 million people. We touched on this subject breifly recently in Book Club when we were discussing the book \"Sarah's Key\" by Tatiana de Rosney. How such a small percentage of Germans were Nazi's and how almost the entire population turned a blind eye and allowed the murder of millions of people in not just Poland and Germany but other countries as well. Some of my favorite lines in Andrew's book are:\"\"How fortunate for leaders,\" Hitler said to his inner circle, \"that men do not think. Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it and eventually they will believe it.\"\"\"Any country can survive having chosen a fool as their leader. But history has shown time and again that a nation of fools is surely doomed.\"\"The most dangerous thing any nation faces is a citezenry capable of trusting a liar to lead them.\"And I say if we had more honest people with strong values in our government our country would be even greater than it is.

It sounds impressive when you read about in Scripture but it's anything but when you see it in person. So it is with Andy Andrews book \"How Do You Kill 11 Million People.\" Andrews has a compelling personal story and is a New York Times bestseller, but this book disappoints. It tackles a big question -- state-sponsered lies and how destructive they can be to a nation -- but fails to offer answers beyond the trivial. He succeeds in accomplishing his goal of writing on a subject that would receive common ground for the future of America (truth telling), avoiding political labels (Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative), and is concise enough to be read in 15 minutes. But a 15 minute read doesn't get to the root of, much less offer solutions to rooting out, an issue that has become ingrained to modern American politics -- lies, spin, and obfuscation. Besides, who needs to read a book on whether truth telling, as opposed to lying, is best for our country -- especially if that's all you're really going for. The Reader's Guide at least offers some hope that the feather weight treatment of a weighty problem might allow Andrews' words to penetrate beyond the surface, though it would have been nice to have had some heft in the argument to begin with."}, {"userName": "Veljko", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742234-veljko", "userReview": "This book seems like a collection of statements, ranging from the common-sensical to the naive oversimplification, roughly organized around the idea that politicians lie - and that electors are too passive to held them accountable. Yet, some oversimplifications border on the absurd. Stating that all problems (ALL problems) are due to the actions of US congressman is plainly absurd. Claiming that Hitler managed to implement the holocaust simply by misleading his own people is historically inaccurate and dangerous - we hopefully know by now that the full story is much more complex.

I think Andrews makes a good point about lying leaders and foolish followers, but I don't think he said anything that isn't common sense. Of course you should not believe everything you are told by those in leadership positions. Of course you should do your own research. (I wouldn't necessarily rely as heavily on un-vetted internet websites for that research as Andrews seems to want us to, but I agree with him on principle). Of course you should be engaged and informed and think critically. Then again, there may be people out there for whom it isn't common sense, in which case I hope they read this book.I wonder if perhaps this book is more effective when accompanied by one of Andrews's lectures, which I have never seen. Overall I think he makes some important points and asks some interesting questions, but not all of those questions are answered here and it is a very cursory overview, full of generalizations, of what could be a really fascinating in-depth study.

Who has not wondered how the Germans of the 1930's and 40's got so any people, not just Jews, to board trains that took them to their death. I know I have. Andy Andrews explains it in very simple to understand terms. It was much easier than you might think and for the German Jews it was not at the point of a gun as you might first believe. There is one chapter that describes how a train track was directly behind a church. Over time the people attending church services discovered it was easier to sign louder to cover the screams of anguish of the prisoners on those trains passing behind the church. I will never forget that explanation nor will I ever forget reading this book. History usually does repeat itself primarily because people do not study history. This is one historical event that no one should ever not be aware of.

If that one commandment happened to be \"Thou Shalt Not Lie\", this earth would be a paradise. Maybe it will eventually happen.

Sometimes, all one needs is a little perspective and Andy has been providing that perspective to some of the world's most influential companies and organizations for the last 20 years. His ability to transform an individual by their own understanding and desire has made him loved by millions.Now, Andy Andrews brings his lessons and perspective into the important arena of government, citizenship, and what it means to completely uphold the truth. If the truth is what sets us free, what does it mean to live in a society where truth is absent? How do truth and lies in the past shape our destiny today? Through the lens of the Holocaust, best-selling author Andy Andrews examines the critical need for truth in our relationships, our communities, and our government.In this compact, nonpartisan book, Andrews urges readers to be \"careful students\" of the past, seeking accurate, factual accounts of events and decisions that illuminate choices we face now. By considering how the Nazi German regime was able to carry out over eleven million institutional killings between 1933 and 1945, Andrews advocates for an informed population that demands honesty and integrity from its leaders and from each other. The future of our country rests on the ability to separate the truth from lies, and Andrews compels each of us to examine our leaders' claims with a critical eye. His question- how do you kill eleven million people?-is provocative, but his warning is clear: \"Only a clear understanding of the answer to this question and the awareness of an involved populace can prevent history from continuing to repeat itself as it already has, time and again.\"", "title": "How Do You Kill 11 Million People?
