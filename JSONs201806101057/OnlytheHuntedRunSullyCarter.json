His traumatic wartime experiences left him with serious PTSD and a bad drinking problem. Still, he manages to solve crimes that elude the police.As the book begins, Sully is at the U.S. Capitol chasing a story about environmental regulations when he hears the burst of an automatic weapon and runs over to find a number of dead and wounded. It is, he muses, the new American nightmare:\u201cThe national anxiety during the Cold War had been a Russian nuclear strike, millions of god-fearing Americans vaporized in an instant. By the turn of the century, the national anxiety had devolved into a crazy man with a gun, god-fearing Americans picked off half a dozen at a time. Slow motion suicide instead of instant annihilation.\u201dInstead of hiding, Sully, a self-admitted chaos junkie, looks for the shooter, eventually finding the mutilated body of a congressman from Oklahoma who was apparently the main intended victim. He also overhears the killer calling 911 and identifying himself as Terry Waters of Oklahoma.Sully, first on the scene, gets the exclusive and continues to follow the story after the shooter, on the run, calls Sully and wants to talk. When Waters follows Sully and shoots at him and his date - fellow reporter Alexis di Rossi - Waters is taken into custody and put in St. Elizabeths, the famous mental hospital in Southeast D.C. Sully then heads out to Oklahoma to see what he can find out about this man and why he went ballistic. As Sully tells the FBI:\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with victims and perps . . . . \u2018Line\u2019s so thin. Stop the clock yesterday morning, he\u2019s a sad story. By nightfall, he\u2019s a monster. I don\u2019t buy he made the transition in the afternoon. Grief is a patient bastard. It\u2019ll take it\u2019s time, twist you into something you never were.\u201dWhat Sully finds is shocking (and based on real historical facts), and leads to a crazily tense and exciting denouement.Discussion: I love this series, for several reasons. One is that Sully is a great character - damaged, with a mix of ruthlessness and compassion, and an ability to cross back and forth over the borders in D.C. in a way most inhabitants there don\u2019t. That there are two worlds within D.C. is not commonly known by tourists: \u201cIt never failed to astonish him how vast the seat of power on the Hill was, a center of clout, senators and representatives who could change the lives of the entire nation, if not the world . . . and, one lousy block east, you crossed a two-lane and you were in a Washington neighborhood of row houses and corner markets and alleyways, where streetlights didn\u2019t work, air-conditioning units hung out of most of the windows, you could buy dope in the parks, and nobody gave a rat\u2019s ass about who you knew.\u201dIn each book in the series so far, Tucker takes pains to expose the very interesting and stark contrast between the class and race divides in D.C. (As Atlantic Magazine reported in 2012: \"The top 5 percent of households in Washington, D.C., made more than $500,000 on average last year, while the bottom 20 percent earned less than $9,500 - a ratio of 54 to 1.\")I also like that Tucker\u2019s writing is so adept and evocative, as indeed you might expect from an actual staff writer at \u201cThe Washington Post,\u201d as with this passage:\u201cThe deputy clerk, seated just in front of the judge, scarcely looked up. Her monotone, born of a thousand days and a million defendants, had all the spontaneity and excitement of a washing machine clicking over to the rinse cycle.\u201dEvaluation: This third book in the series featuring reporter Sully Carter keeps you turning the pages. I especially like the way in which the author integrates local history and color into the plot. The dialogue is a good mix of insider jargon, cynical shorthand, and gritty realism. Fans of hard-boiled crime fiction, especially those who like D.C. settings, will welcome this latest installment."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "A special thank you to Viking Books for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. 5 stars + Enthralling!

Age old dark secrets, abuse, corruption, and violence of St. Elizabeth\u2019s federal psychiatric hospital\u2014for a complex, multi-layered \"gritty\" page-turner psychological crime thriller (literary fiction). Landing on my Top Books of 2016  - a flawed, driven, razor-sharp and witty investigative reporter who never lets up, in this action-packed suspense adventure. For fans of Michael Connelly (Harry Bosch), John Hart, John Grisham, Greg Iles, Lisa Scottoline, and David Baldacci. Bourbon lover,  reporter, Sully had been assigned a bullshit story about environmental regulations governing oil drilling in the Gulf. Then in the sagging hours of this afternoon errand, there had come the burst of automatic weapons fire, the bleeding and screaming, everything going out of focus and off kilter\u2014the modern American nightmare. The US Capitol  --Sully alone in the core of the building that symbolized America\u2019s allegedly invincible power. And his isolation telling him with every step that something had gone terribly wrong. Shooting, screaming, dead bodies, blown open \u2013 one gunman. An attack unlike any other in the nation\u2019s history. Sully is in the center of the investigation. Sully stumbles  on the body of Barry Edmonds, an Oklahoma representative with stainless steel ice picks driven though each eye, plus he had been shot. What the heck?  Terry Waters the gunman, is calling it in, personally-- to 911 stating he had to kill him. It had gotten messy. The man was now gone. \"And indeed there will be timeFor the yellow smoke that slides along the street,Rubbing in back upon the window-panes;There will be time, there will be timeTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;There will be time to murder and create . . .--TS. Eliot, \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Purfrock\"  When later running  the guy, through the system, he had been certifiable since high school at the local Native American reservation, which appears to be the Sac and Fox. He dropped out in 1982. As a junior, in and out of wards and the local jailhouse for a year of two, then apparently kept at home. Also a suspect in some animal mutilations. No one has seen him in years. Why now?A manhunt.  The gunman had killed US Rep. Barry Edmonds and eight others (turns out to be ten in the end). Sully did not let him into the Capital or did he let him get out. He had gotten within ten feet of him without a gun, pistol, or badge.Waters later becomes obsessed  with Carter, and calls him directly, to commiserate about the fact that both their mothers were murdered years earlier, after reading his story in the paper or online. (at first I was thinking similar to Bosch\u2019s mom connection); however, goes much, much deeper, and sinister. Waters: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand this. It\u2019s key. Only the hunted run. I, me. I\u2019m not the hunted. I\u2019m not running. I hunt. I am the hunter.\u201d The most hunted man in American thinks he\u2019s the predator? How did he know about his mom? Now this guy has his own reporter at his disposal. Sully\u2019s mom  was shot to death in Tulsa, Louisiana. In her hair salon. Cash was left in the register. No apparent motive, no suspects. Three shots, two to the head. A pistol, not a shotgun. His girlfriend was also killed by shrapnel to the head in Bosnia. More to be uncovered here. Grief, shrinks, doctors, counselors.  The guy was a sad story, by nightfall he\u2019s a monster. A thin line. \u201cGrief is a patient bastard. It\u2019ll take its time, twist you into something you never were.\u201d The guy had to get attention. He was scattered and he stuttered. What is his story, and is this guy who he claims to be? When searching the history of Waters in Oklahoma, he uncovers danger, eccentric characters, horrors, abuse, and violence. A family of mental illness. The Thing in the Dark. The great dream of peace,  corrupted by the American nightmare of murder and blood. Who can he trust? \"Millions of lives teeming on the head of a pin, the universe neither concerned nor vindictive nor compassionate. People-they were just one little self-regarding species on one planet. They died and the universe was indifferent. It didn\u2019t mean anything. It was like drowning in the ocean. The ocean wasn\u2019t trying to drown you. It was just being the ocean. You got out of the water, fine; you got eaten by sharks, fine; you drowned, fine. It didn\u2019t matter as far as the ocean went. That was life on Earth. It killed you without thinking.\" If we are all so insignificant, why did settling the accounts of the dead matter so much? A possibly mentally disturbed  Native American, lightly educated and living in rural squalor, and yet he\u2019s broken into the Capital, killed his target, escaped, and now he\u2019s calling reporters and chatting about dead moms and obscure poetry. The FBI want to know from Carter, how he explains this? Once Waters  is apprehended in yet another shoot-out, Carter travels to the Oklahoma Indian reservation where Waters claims to hail from, hoping to learn what has driven the man to kill. What Carter finds is a shocker, leading him on another dangerous mission. The man is charged with killing ten people in the US Capitol, four of them officers, one of them a woman. Meanwhile, Waters is being held at St. Elizabeths, a real-life mental hospital in southeast D.C., with which he\u2019s obsessed. Sully is on deadline,  and his trip to Oklahoma really drives the story, when he learns Waters has been dead for nearly eight years, or so some say. . So who is the guy in St. Elizabeths? That means someone is locked up in DC who has assumed his identify\u2014what do they have in common? This complicates their story. \"People did not walk off the face of the Earth. They left traces, fingerprints, property, financial transactions. What had Faulkner called it?  A scratch mark on the face of oblivion?\" What is the link to the killing? From friends,  neighbors, father\u2019s, mother\u2019s, grandparents, the boy is being held in the heavily secured grounds of one of the most notorious mental hospitals in the US. Furthermore, in the most secured building on the godforsaken campus, on the lockdown ward of the hall for the criminally insane. How are they going to get to this guy (the ice-picker) to get their answers?Ghosts and lunatics,  the long halls of madness. Sully was the perfect witness. Who better to tell the tale? Lobotomies. Walter Jackson Freeman. An insane asylum. Before Thorazine. Schizophrenics. Violence. Mental illness in America. Brains destroyed. Suicide. St. Elizabeths. Children caught up in the history. One of Washington\u2019s toughest,  sexy, edgy and gutsy reporters \u2013 (and witty), Sully Carter, a seasoned foreign correspondent, gets in and out of jams while covering local D.C. \u2013 the fictional brainchild of one of D.C.\u2019s most versatile reporters, Neely Tucker  (man, can he write, and have never laughed so hard at his best one-liners).  Impressive! An excellent writer-  At the  Washington Post, Tucker has worked a lot of beats, writing everything from presidential profiles to poignant glimpses into lives touched by crime. He also writes fiction that is very much of this region and of this cultural moment, exploring themes of race, mental health care, crime and history through his Sully Carter series. Wow, ONLY THE HUNTED RUN -is mind-blowing! His best yet. From twists and turns you do not see coming, and the personal and professional life of Sully, keeps readers glued to the pages.Not for the faint of heart,  Tucker explores the darkest evil places. History and legal buffs will enjoy the factual events inspired by the 1998 Russell Weston story, and the history of St E\u2019s. Loved the relationship with Sully, Alexis, and nephew Josh on a personal level. In addition to the hardcover supplied by the publisher (bookmarked so many pages)\u2014\"Thank you so much\"- read in one sitting; I also purchased the audiobook, narrated by Scott Sowers (sexy, bold, powerful), a perfect match for Neely\u2019s Sully. (he is outstanding-always enjoy performances with Hart and Grisham, and other top author's audios).Cannot wait to continue  the journey with Sully Carter! Will Sully be able to let go of the voices, murder, violence, and horror? Highly recommend the author and this extraordinary \"must read\"series!  JDCMustReadBooks Having read the other books in the Sully Carter series (highly recommend), I realized I had not read Neely Tucker\u2019s Love in the Driest Season  (read by the author)- his award-winning memoir. Immediately, purchased the audiobook, currently listening.

I'm going to borrow from one of my previous descriptions of Sully:\"The best protagonists for crime books are the walking wounded, the ones who buck authority, the ones who just can't let things be or let justice go unserved. Sully Carter fills the bill on every count. He's battling PTSD, alcohol and anger issues, his bosses and manages to step on toes everywhere he goes. He's also a confidant of the one of DC's crime lords. Flawed but driven.\"Sully is in the Capitol building on an assignment when a shooter goes on a rampage. Sully, instead of running, moves further into the building, chasing the story. He gets close, manages to hide, and is a first hand witness to the carnage. The shooter himself makes the 911 call, but manages to walk out without being apprehended. After reading Sully's story, he calls him, insisting they have similarities in their lives. And that they should talk.....I always love keeping an eye out for the title cue as I read. In this case, it comes from Terry Waters, the shooter:\"Sully, okay. You've got to understand this. It's key. Only the hunted run. I, me, I'm not the hunted. I'm not running. I hunt. I am the hunter.\"But Sully too is hunting - hunting for who Terry Waters is and the whys and wherefores of his killing spree.The journey for those answers makes for addictive reading. It was only when I finished the book that I discovered that Neely had (again) woven in fact with fiction. It was hard to believe that these horrific historical details were sickeningly real.What makes this such a great series? Well, I love the main character, flaws and all. Sully is making progress on the anger, drinking and PTSD, but it's two steps forward, one step back. Tucker has given Sully an expanded personal life with Alexis that I hope lasts - I quite like her. There seems to be an exit for one supporting character that I will be sad to see leave. But I am looking forward to seeing what his replacement will bring to the series.The writing is fantastic - great pacing, dialogue, setting and plotting. And no wonder - Tucker himself is a writer at The Washington Post. He's also been a war correspondent in over sixty countries. Tucker brings that experience and knowledge to his writing. And to Sully as well - I do wonder how much of Tucker himself is woven into the character?Only the Hunted Run was another great read for me. I look forward to number four."}, {"userName": "Veronica ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7035111-veronica", "userReview": "Another engrossing story following intrepid reporter, Sully Carter. This time around Sully unwittingly finds himself in the center of the action when an armed gunman opens fire at the Capitol building, killing several, including his intended target. Poor man should start getting hazard pay, or at least get a raise. As Sully tries to track the mind of a killer, meanwhile playing host to his 15 year old nephew, he stumbles into the types of twists and turns that are a hallmark of this series. I could have done without the nephew, Josh, since his existence seemed to come out of nowhere (though, to be fair, a sister was mentioned in the last book), but he really didn't play a big part. Criminal underlord, Sly Hastings, is once again in play but there were some interesting developments on that front. But even better, Alexis is back and considering taking on a position at the newspaper as a photo editor. That's Sully's hope anyway and it was nice to see him have some normal moments with her considering everything else that happens in this book. As I said before, the man should demand hazard pay. I don't know if there will be any more Sully books (though I certainly hope so!) but the ending of this one could possibly serve as a series end, if needed.

In an exciting and mesmerizing thriller the mystery widens when Sully finds no background information on the murderer Terry Waters who's finally been caught and after ranting insanely in court sent for an evaluation to St. Elizabeth's mental hospital. With dogged determination he sets out for Oklahoma to dig into the past of the Native American uncovering clues that link Terry Waters to inhumanity and corruption at St. Elizabeth's.Fast-paced and action-packed the plot heats up when Sully begins to uncover clues to Terry's identity, damaged past and a connection to the mental hospital. Skilfully Neely Tucker builds intensity and suspense as Sully uncovers the truth beginning with Elaine Thornton, a native woman with inside information on Terry Waters and his father revealing a connection to the Harpers, a family that suffered traumatic loss. With every piece to the puzzle Sully opens a window to Terry's past as the plot twists and turns until ending in a violent confrontation. Yet even as the danger and heightens, and Terry Water's insanity and obsession with the reporter intensifies the horrifying reality of Sully's investigation is tempered by his witty banter and interaction with Josh, Alexis and his colleagues at work.Sully Carter is the reckless, dogged and tough investigative reporter with an attitude who's determined to uncover the truth. Scarred while on assignment overseas and haunted by tragic loss in his past he gravitates towards Alexis the smart and self-confident foreign correspondent who's been hired as an editor. Alexis and his nephew the introverted and uncommunicative fifteen year old Josh give him a sense of grounding in an investigation that's dangerous and has him ducking bullets and fleeing a bomb. Neely Tucker's characters are complex and colourful infusing the story with high-energy and drama.Based on a factual case, the author has woven a heart-pounding, thrilling story that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Although the language is graphic at times I liked \"Only The Hunted Run\" and won't hesitate to read other novels in the Sully Carter series."}, {"userName": "Bent Hansen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26421090-bent-hansen", "userReview": "Before starting to read this book, I had never even heard of Neely Tucker or his series about the journalist Sully Carter, and I therefore had my doubts about getting into a series in book three. Well, no problems there. There are numerous references to his past life but none that ruins this third book.Sully Carter is a no-nonsense reporter that keeps his head cool despite getting shot at, lied to and threatened with all kinds of things. He drinks a little too much, but he digs into his work with a ferocious determination that gives the story a drive and sets a breathtaking pace at times. Neely Tucker doesn't make it too easy for his protagonist, which is a huge plus in my book, and Tucker's humor and style makes the book a pleasant and interesting read. When Tucker adds several major twists and turns, you have yourself a real page-turner that only loses its pace a couple of times.

It wasn't a bad novel by any means, but for some reason I just didn't groove on it. The main character, Sully Carter, is a reporter and takes his job very seriously. He's calm, cool, and collected pretty much at all times. The only real vice Sully has is that he (in my opinion) drinks a bit too much. I can see how people would love Sully as a main character, but I just did not click with him. The plot of this one is well thought out, and full of unexpected twists and turns that keep things interesting. Tucker adds in enough humor to keep things light, and the pace of the book is fast.

I love the main character, Sully Carter, and each book in this series has sucked me in almost immediately. The setting is great, and it's a treat to read Tucker's descriptions of busy newsrooms and hard-hitting journalists before the decline of the industry. In each book in the series, my only complaint has been the ending. I feel like Tucker always starts out with a tight, well-paced plot, but then succumbs to an ending that's bigger than it needs to be to pack a punch. It's not that the mysteries are bad, or that the endings are unsatisfying, it's just that they don't hold up to the quality of the rest of the book for me.

From this moment on I was hooked to this story and Sully as he was not afraid to get his hands dirty to find the truth.

In an incident loosely based on an actual even in 1998, a gunman shoots up the Capitol. Sully Carter is inside and begins investigating. The gunman eventually gets caught and ends up in St Elizabeths, the notorious DC mental hospital. Sully's efforts to find out more take him to rural Oklahoma, where it turns out the gunman isn't who he says he is. Now Sully has to figure out the gunman's true identity and what his motive is for the shootings. It turns out that he has a family history with St E's and the history of the hospital and it's equally notorious lobotomy doctor are revealed. In the end, there is a very violent confrontation at the hospital, leading to explosions, fire, and more violent deaths.Having lived on Oklahoma before I moved to DC, this book was right up my alley. It started a little slow, but soon became hard to put down. My only problem with it is the over-the-top ending. The rest of the book could easily be true and the gist of the parts about the hospital and the lobotomy doctor are true.

Only the Hunted Run certainly didn't disappoint.Neely Tucker wastes no time getting started, dropping the reader right in the middle of a shooting at the U.S. Capitol. Sully Carter happens to be in the building when the shooting starts. Being a newspaper reporter, instead of evacuating, he pursues the shooter and the story. We follow Sully throughout the book as he digs deeper into the story, trying to determine who the shooter was and their motivation for the crime. The novel is fast paced, and took a few turns I wasn't expecting along the way. It started out so quickly, I was hooked from page one. I liked that Sully is a reporter, giving him a different perspective and motivation for his inquiries than you see in a typical detective mystery. Without saying too much the shooter is soon captured and his apparently crazy rantings in courts send him to a mental hospital for evaluation while he is awaiting trial. Meanwhile Carter heads to Oklahoma, where the shooter hails from, and starts peeling layers off the onion and it soon turns out that things are a lot different from what they first appeared to be and this continues as Carter returns to Washington. While the story line is fascinating and appealing, I didn't quite get as hooked as I had hoped to be. Sully Carter is an interesting character, a flawed persona with good instincts for reporting and investigating. Although right now I'm not sure, I may return to the earlier volumes in this series to learn more about Sully.Only the Hunted Run by Neely Tucker is an outstanding story which hardcore thriller lovers will enjoy.

First, Sully Carter is an interesting character. Too often the detectives at the heart of crime series are wooden or one-note. They're ALL badass grit, or too clever by half, or lacking a personal life because they just live and breathe their work. Carter is messy, he's complicated and he's able to make you laugh as well as keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, as someone who lives in D.C. and appreciates its complex nature on and beyond the Capitol grounds I can attest that Tucker really captures that complexity. This novel starts in the hallowed halls of the Hill, but quickly takes us beyond them into neighborhoods and local institutions that a lesser writer would gloss over or would not get quite right. As a local and respected reporter himself, Tucker nails them. Finally, it's GOOD. It's a compelling narrative with a plot touching on some of the hottest hot buttons of the day - mass shootings, mental health, treatment of Native Americans - keeping you entertained while simultaneously keeping you aware and giving you insights. Go - read them all. Then join me in waiting for the next one."}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2401232-bob", "userReview": "Another new author and another new character, Sully Carter, a reporter for a Washington DC paper working in the city after assignments in the hot beds of Europe.

(2016). Neely Tucker. ***1/2.This was a non-stop action thriller that screams out to be made into a film. The story is carefully layered into an ultimately possessive fabric that impels the reader onwards to the climax. The use of a newspaper reporter as the protagonist is not common, and adds possibilities to the plot. I have not read the first two novels in this series featuring Sully Carter, but this still works as a stand-alone effort \u2013 even though much of Carter\u2019s history was obviously covered in the first two episodes. The climax was mind-boggling, although I \u2013 being me \u2013 lost track of the identities of some of the final players. I did manage to turn back a few pages to refresh my memory. The problem is that the climax becomes so intense that my reading becomes rapid scanning. Take a tip from me, though: keep reading slowly at the end."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13430735-paula", "userReview": "Thanks to Goodreads and Penguin Random House Canada for a free copy of this book.I hadn't read any other Sully Carter books before Only The Hunted Run. While it is the third book in the series, it does work as a stand alone novel. This book has lots of action, a suspenseful plot with lots of twists and turns, and a likeable main character in Sully Carter, an investigative reporter, instead of your typical detective or cop. My favourite thing about the novel is how the author \"worked factual events into a fictional universe.\" Working information about the history of St. Elizabeth's, mental illness and lobotomies into the plot made this novel more interesting than the typical action novel for me."}, {"userName": "Ed Barks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58438729-ed-barks", "userReview": "Other reviewers have covered the plot, so I won\u2019t delve into that.

Some parts of the story - I guess you'd call them local color or \"side events\" that didn't relate to the central story - were sort of irrelevant, but they didn't take up too much space. My impression with some of the \"side-stories\" is that he was writing this thinking about making this a movie.
