I actually got in trouble for taking these books out of the library in kindergarten constantly. The librarian's assistant (not the librarian, but the librarian's ASSISTANT) pulled me aside when I went to check one out for about the hundredth time, SIGHED HEAVILY, and instructed me to pick another \"kind\" of book from now on."}, {"userName": "Heila", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3821647-heila", "userReview": "I read and read and *read* these books as a kid, and had forgotten all about them. I think they make a nice bridge between standard picture books and ones with much more text, but still plenty of wonderful illustrations. I looked and looked at the pictures as well as reading about Dorrie's escapades when I was young. I like the fantastical element in the illustrations and in the stories. They're grounded in humor though and real, warty (pun totally intended here) characters. The way the mother witch's sleeves flow is what might've inspired my own drawings of flowing sleeves around the ages of 8 and 9 maybe. There was also a long period when I drew princesses wearing cone-shaped hats with flowing gauze streaming from the tops. I believe these books appeal to that age and personality."}, {"userName": "Alaina Sloo", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5247983-alaina-sloo", "userReview": "An oldie but goodie early reader series that's also fun to read aloud to younger readers.
