Now I freely admit that I primarily know The Bat through film and TV, so I\u2019m not entirely sure how he\u2019s gained this title. You don\u2019t see many Batman locked-room mysteries; The Joker and The Riddler are normally very blas\u00e9 about their crimes, and don\u2019t hide behind a series of red herrings; while you don\u2019t often see Batman get all the suspects together at the end of tell them whodunit. I can vaguely remember seeing an old comic book image of Batman with his cowl still on, sitting behind a microscope examining evidence (an odd image, as the cowl would be really impractical for the task, don\u2019t you think?) Beyond that though, I can\u2019t think why Batman has that title and yet he does.Here then in literature is the coming together of the two Great Detectives: \u2018Sherlock Holmes v. Batman: Dawn of Steampunk\u2019.Well, actually no, the appearance of Batman in a novel like this would lead to three dozen IP lawyers having excited palpitations. Instead we have a Batman-esque hero, one with the resources and the gadgets and a name which strikes supernatural terror into the criminal underworld. Only this one is based in the East End rather than Gotham City.A series of explosions rocks London, and whereas Mycroft Holmes is desperate for his brother to investigate, Sherlock himself is anxious to pursue the so called Baron Cauchemar. Some say this Baron is but a myth, some think the tales of him are nothing but the exaggerations of frightened criminals, but without a doubt he is the scourge of the East End and Holmes is convinced that his appearance is not unconnected to the wave of bombings.It\u2019s a diverting tale, although one which is so excited by the possibilities of its steampunk superhero, that it sometimes feels like Holmes and Watson are passengers in their own story \u2013 a distinct feat when Watson is narrating him. Still it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun, and that\u2019s more that can be said for a lot of faux Holmes stories."}, {"userName": "Jasper", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6260734-jasper", "userReview": "originally posted at:http://thebookplank.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-stuff-of-nightmares.htmlTitan Books has been a steadily releasing new Sherlock Holmes fiction over the last couple of years. Sherlock Holmes with his witty remarks and his remarkable sense of observations has always been of interest of me. I read The Army of Dr. Moreau by Guy Adams which has the same type of cover art, there isn't a mentioning of a series that I can find. But what I did discover is that both the books: The Army of Dr. Moreau and The Stuff of Nightmares have a lot of supernatural influences. The Stuff of Nightmares is written by James Lovegrove, who is well known for his Pantheon and Redlaw series. It's hard to say whether Sherlock and Watson really go through a development from book to book. There has been many stories written that feature Sherlock and his assistant Dr. Watson, but when I think of this enigmatic duo, I think classic Victorian London, walking sticks, bowler and top type hats and pipes. And yes, each writer has its own writing style and I was wondering how James Lovegrove would voice and let show Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. He did it in the way that most fans will like it, the classic Victorian take, with Sherlock taking the lead, being his typical \"dare-devilish\" nature and his keen eye of observation and Watson taking the more \u201clet\u2019s think it over before we act\u201d side. Because they themselves are already well established, they can be readily used and allowed James Lovegrove to write up a detailed case study for Sherlock and Dr. Watson. The narration in the way that Watson is writing a book, partly reflecting back on the adventures themselves this allowed a unique way of showing the story as there was one part when Sherlock could have died but the reflection that Watson does with: \u201cWell I could prolong the assumption that Sherlock was dead\u201d but he jumps right back into the story.For the story of The Stuff of Nightmares, think steampunk, a lot. The story starts off with a the mentioning of recent bombings that have been plaguing the city of London and the perpetrator or perpetrators haven\u2019t been caught so far. Now Sherlock is drawn in to this mystery by his ever-present curiosity to find out who is behind these attacks and why. In the initial set-up of the story you are introduced to several storylines; the first is the case with the bombings that present a threat and the second one is the masked man known as Baron Cauchemar. As you can make up from the synopsis and cover of the book, the steampunk influence I mentioned above is heavily proven by the character of Baron Cauchemar with his various nifty gadgets. But I will get to him in a bit. The first 2/3 of The Stuff of Nightmares is all about showing exposure to current events, what is happening and introducing you to a lot of characters, some to be trusted more than others. You, or I at least, started to make my mind up who the bomber would be and could, in the beginning only make up one character, but by the intervention at the church I was proven wrong. From this point onwards, James Lovegrove, carefully start to release more and more information about one specific character and later Sherlock, as clever as he is, connects the dots. We are still only 2/3 into the story so far and you learn who the bad guy is, now this can break a book, by revealing the culprit to soon it could climax its plot to soon as well. Well that's not the case at all. As you now also learn what the intentions are of the ultimate bad guy of the book and does produce a mad rush for our duo to save the country! I really liked how all of a sudden, by just a few hints, a lot of the earlier proposed things feel into place and how the story in the end was broadened to a whole other level. Well I just have to say this of the plot, the mad race in the end, with Sherlock and Watson in an airship chasing a train, in Victorian steampunk London, that just gives some cool graphic images in the back of my mind. Next to the bombings, which proof to be the major part of the storyline there was also the introduction of Baron Cauchemar, first as a myth then as a real person. He is the proposed scourge for the villains of the dark streets of London, only shows himself at night to mete out justice. When I first read about him, I just couldn't trust him, like there has to be more to his character. Baron Cauchemar is a piece of engineering and making bombs also requires a certain finesse and skill... However soon along the lines of the book you learn more about his intentions and in the end his whole story of how it came to be is told, which made it all even that more understandable to what happened earlier. The part that I liked most about his character was his whole set of gear. Yes, he is the guy on the cover. When he \"undresses\" his armor its told in such a way that I saw this red and yellow suite hovering in the back of my mind! All the gadgets from steamblasters, gas emmisions and his springheels is just awesome to read about, especially taken into consideration his vigilante role and the day and age this story take place.Now as for the ultimate bad guy of the story, I won't reveal who it is, it's some you have to find out for yourself. But the ending of this book, it something that even the sharpest investigator won't be able to pick out of how as the story starts to unravel. In those last few chapters! brilliant right there. I had this big ear to ear smile on my face when I read Chapter 40 and was making a particular sound, that undoubtedly many other readers will do as well when they read these scenes. This is really talking about lets introduce something totally different.The whole story of The Stuff of Nightmares managed to grab me from the start but the ending in particular really made this story much more enjoyable super to read. Because on one hand you have the classic Victorian Sherlock Holmes and John Watson and on the other hand you have the influences of something supernatural that makes the whole story just come to life. The Stuff of Nightmares is a great read, which a lot a fantasy enthusiasts will enjoy, it\u2019s has the good point of both worlds, the crime investigation that show a more darker side to the story combined with a lot of cool steampunk and other fantasy elements. If you are looking for a transformed story of your favorite investigative duo, you really have to pick the new Sherlock Holmes books of Titan, they have a fine set of authors steadily turning out more and more books, the next Sherlock Holmes adventure The Will of the Dead by George Mann is out the 8th of November"}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/348805-marleen", "userReview": "When Dr. Watson returns to London by train he finds himself caught up in a bombing at Waterloo station. After giving what attention he can to those injured in the attack he wastes no time in getting to 221B Baker Street and his friend Sherlock Holmes.This is the third in a series of bombings which hold London and its inhabitants in a scary hold, with theories about the bombers and their reasons getting more hysterical by the day. But the bombings are not the only strange phenomena in London at the time. A strange creature, about eight feet tall, with enormous strength and a scary arsenal of weapons has taken on London\u2019s underworld. He interrupts misdeeds and incapacitates the villains although he never kills his opponents. Only known by the name Baron Cauchemar, many consider this man a myth, yet Sherlock Holmes is convinced that the Baron may be the key that will lead to unlocking the identity of those behind the bombings. And although both his brother, Mycroft and Dr. Watson have their doubts, he is determined to conduct his investigation along those lines.What follows is an investigation that will bring our two heroes face to face with pure evil. Confronting mortal danger more than once Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson have not only men\u2019s evil to contend with, but also technological advances beyond their wildest imaginations. With the future of the British Empire at stake, Holmes and Watson have to embrace an unlikely ally if there are going to prevent disaster.I have to say that I\u2019m greatly enjoying this series of newly written Sherlock Holmes adventures. While the stories in this series are close enough to the originals to keep fans of Arthur Conan Doyle happy, they also provide us with story lines that go beyond what he might have been able to conceive of in his days.The Stuff of Nightmares is an intriguing, well plotted and fast paced mystery, just as you would expect from a Sherlock Holmes story. What makes this book that little bit more special is the fact that it also contains elements that strongly remind me of Steam-Punk. It was fun to see Watson immediately think of the supernatural whenever he encounters something he doesn\u2019t understand while Holmes, even when he has no better idea what exactly he is dealing with than his partner does, insists that there has to be a logical explanation.Apart from the steam-punkish elements, this is exactly what you would expect from a Sherlock Holmes story. We are given a dire threat, no obvious clues, quite a bit of misdirection and Holmes talking in riddles, just as he would in one of the traditional stories. We encounter familiar names from the Sherlock Holmes stories: the Baker Street Irregulars, Professor Moriarty, Mycroft Holmes, Inspector Lestrade, they all make an appearance and live up to their established reputation. While Sherlock Holmes purists may well find one or more things to object to in this book, I found great pleasure in the non-traditional elements of this story.James Lovegrove is an established and successful author of Science Fiction books and his writing experience shines through in this book. The story is smooth, the plot well developed and the mystery intriguing enough to keep the reader guessing until the author, or Sherlock Holmes, is ready to enlighten them. The author\u2019s background is clear though when you read the technological descriptions in this book; the machines and contraptions are described in such detail that it is easy to visualise them. Overall I would call this a very welcome addition to the Sherlock Holmes stories that we know and love. Filled with danger, action and mystery, this is a book that is hard to put down once started. If Mr. Lovegrove ever decides to write another Sherlock Holmes story I will definitely read it."}, {"userName": "Tac Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4618685-tac-anderson", "userReview": "This was an excellent book. The writing was strong, and Lovegrove knows his Sherlock Holmes. The premise of the book is that it's written by Watson much later in life and there are shed loads of references to Doyle's other Sherlock stories. In fact, Lovegrove even takes it upon himself to rectify a few earlier inconsistencies. Some people might find this a bit pretentious as it didn't really add anything to the story but I found it a fun nod to the Holmes cannonites who might be reading. The writing is not for from Doyle's but I don't think Lovegrove was trying to mimic him and I tend to like it better when authors of pastiches don't. Besides the steampunk nature of the story there are some modern themes that Doyle would not likely address, like various sexual predilections. A note on the steampunk, it's not over the top (except the end) but it's not bashful either. There's a 19th century Iron Man and vigilante, there's a lighter than air flying machine, and there's a train that transforms into a steampunk mech robot. Yeah that's the one over the top part and I could have lived without it. In fact if it wasn't for that part of the ending, I probably would have given this a 4 star rating."}, {"userName": "Riju Ganguly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2736147-riju-ganguly", "userReview": "This was a steampunk novel (not a very good one) that merely used the names (and supposedly characters) of Sherlock Holmes, Dr John Watson, Professor Moriarty, Inspector Lestrade et.al.

So, overall, I was rather disappointed.What I did like a lot was the very beginning, Watson thinking of his wife, Mary, who was recuperating from yet another failed pregnancy that hit her really hard, his need to hide the reason behind her failing health from Holmes, the explosion at the railway station, Watson helping the wounded... that was really great and I wish the whole book was like that, deeply emotional and close to heart.

But I loved that those were in there, making me feel the narrative was all the more connected to the on-going legacy of Sherlock Holmes.Double-score for me was the steampunk aspect of the mystery. The mystery itself was decent, up until 2/3 of the way in when I had pretty much guessed the \"solution\" but which wasn't revealed until the very end, so the ending did drag a tiny bit for me. And one teensy weensy additional issue: Sherlock admitted to making more than one error in judgment during the case - while it has been shown that my perfect Sherlock does make mistakes from time to time, I don't find it believable that he would make more than one error in a case.All in all, a cracking good addition to the Sherlock legacy."}, {"userName": "K.A.

It\u2019s a frustrating read in some ways: there\u2019s good ideas here and some excellent action. The is-he-a-hero-or-villain Baron Cauchemar is a fun idea and the chance to bring together a heady mix of political maneuvering and popular prejudice around the bombings offers an opportunity for oblique commentary on the present. But the narrative frequently comes to a complete halt in the midst of action whether it\u2019s for Watson to explain the history of baritsu or for the Baron to give an elaborate backstory. I was ready to scream several times, when the story gets to the action, it moves along at a good clip with good detail (though I did not for a moment believe the key Transformer-like moment). Like a lot of faux historical texts, it uses its time period as an excuse to reduce female characters to nothing more than servants of men whether angels who keep the house (Mrs Hudson and Mrs Watson) or prostitutes.

The addition of an element of steam punk to the story works and if Lovegrove fails to reproduce the cold, analytical genius of Holmes that was the hallmark of Doyle\u2019s stories, he more than makes up for it with the action scenes.\tI approached this novel (as part of my attempt to read all of Lovegrove\u2019s novels) with more than a little trepidation as I was unsure how the author would have approached the task.

Meanwhile, a strangely garbed figure has been spotted haunting the rooftops and grimy back alleys of the capital.Sherlock Holmes believes this strange masked man may hold the key to the attacks. He moves with the extraordinary agility of a latter-day Spring-heeled Jack. He possesses weaponry and armour of unprecedented sophistication. He is known only by the name Baron Cauchemar, and he appears to be a scourge of crime and villainy. But is this masked man truly the force for good that he seems? Is he connected somehow to the bombings? Holmes and his faithful companion Dr. Watson are about to embark on one of their strangest and most exhilarating adventures yet.This book opens with a blast! A bomb blast at Waterloo Station that Watson came close to getting killed at. From there this story picks up speed and tension. Holmes is interested in a person calling himself Baron Cauchemar, or Nightmare. I have to say if Bob Kane had created Batman for 1890 London and blended in more Science Fiction elements this is what his creation would have come to be. I like Cauchemar and hope he appears in more novels he deserves more attention with or without Holmes and Watson. Then there is the terrorist bombings and great danger to the future of the British Empire. This is an intriguing, well plotted and fast paced mystery that goes along at a roller-coaster pace. Add in the extra elements of Science Fiction and Mr. Lovegrove has given us a page turning thriller that will not disappoint any Sherlock Holmes fan. \u201dSherlock Holmes: The Stuff of Nightmares\u201d is great fun.

Though not as complicated a story as I would have liked, the mystery being quite easily solved, it was an enjoyable action packed tale. Also the steampunk elements do not detract from the classic characters and the central mystery. Some similar books seem to concentrate on gimmicks to differentiate from the original tales and that then becomes the main thrust of the story, instead of Holmes and Watson.\tThough unique in its affinity to steampunk, it does remain authentic, characterisation and style are certainly echoes of Doyle\u2019s\u2019 work. Even the supporting characters are written as they would have been in the classics. The narration as always is from Watson\u2019s perspective and is very well done.\tSherlock Holmes fits quite well into a fantastical science fiction setting, due to his open minded nature, and his willingness to accept the improbable as the truth. Although none of the original stories had a science fiction theme, there were often hints that something other or supernatural was at work, before a feasible explanation was found by Holmes, The Hound of the Baskervilles being a prime example of this. \tA touch of humour throughout added to my enjoyment of the book. Watson\u2019s willingness to except a supernatural occurrence as the only solution to the questions posed and Sherlock\u2019s insistence that there was an earthly realistic explanation was one of my favourite elements, as they argued throughout about this. There was never any danger of the wheel being reinvented here, but I would still recommend this as one of the better science Fiction themed Sherlock Holmes novels."}], "description": "It's the autumn of 1890, and a spate of bombings has hit London.

But one man suspects an even more sinister hand behind the violence.\u00a0 Sherlock Holmes believes Professor Moriarty is orchestrating a nationwide campaign of terror, but to what end? At the same time, a bizarrely garbed figure has been spotted on the rooftops and in the grimy back alleys of the capital.\u00a0 He moves with the extraordinary agility of a latter-day Spring-heeled Jack.\u00a0 He possesses weaponry and armour of unprecedented sophistication.\u00a0 He is known only by the name Baron Cauchemar, and he appears to be a scourge of crime and villainy. But is this masked man truly the force for good that he seems?\u00a0 Is he connected somehow to the bombings?\u00a0 Holmes and his faithful companion Dr. Watson are about to embark on one of their strangest and most exhilarating adventures yet.", "title": "Sherlock Holmes: The Stuff of Nightmares\n      \n          (Sherlock Holmes)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17412720-sherlock-holmes", "average": 3.78, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408939234l/17412720.jpg", "reviews": 71, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/98903.James_Lovegrove", "name": "James Lovegrove"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Science Fiction", "Historical", "Fiction", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17412720-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16169874-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23901982-the-stuff-of-nightmares", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20318032-sherlock-holmes---the-stuff-of-nightmares", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6484173-the-age-of-ra", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7015318-the-age-of-zeus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7775741-the-age-of-odin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12648435-age-of-aztec", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15802898-age-of-voodoo"]}
