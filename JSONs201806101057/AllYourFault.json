It\u2019s a deeply moving portrait of family drama that kept me hooked until the last page. I also wish this was part of a series because DS Clarke is such an amazing character and I feel like he has a much bigger story to tell, he deserves more than getting a side story. I refuse to be spoilery so I\u2019m not gonna explain this any further but there is a certain male character that made me feel all sorts of things I never felt before for that type of person - I felt compassion, pity and deep understanding which is not something I ever thought I would say but J.C. Lewin made me see things from a different point of view, and for that I\u2019ll be forever grateful."}, {"userName": "Savanah Rae", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3382033-savanah-rae", "userReview": "I received this book from Netgalley in return for my honest opinion.This was such a fabulous book. I read it in one day. I needed to know what was going to happen in the end.If you love psychological thrillers, this is a great one.Suzanne Walker has spent her life trying to save kids from foster homes. Like everyone in the DSS field, sometimes you can't save everyone. Unfortunately one of the twin boys she was working with, committed suicide and in her newest case, Emily was murdered by her mother.Suzanne feels so horrible about it and her daughter feels as though Suzanne only cares about the children she works with. Suzanne works long hours.Suzanne and her daughter Teigan have a horrible fight and Suzanne doesn't realize her daughter has disappeared.Suzanne and her estranged sister try to figure out where Teigan has gone. Suzanne finds her laptop and find disturbing clues that Teigan might be involved with an older man.This whole book is just messed up from the start. You think you've figured out where Teigan is but I never figured It out and was blown away from the ending."}, {"userName": "Sally Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73970797-sally-maxwell", "userReview": "Thank you Bastei Entertainment for the Arc.This book drew me in from the beginning, it held me completely till the end, and what a twist, did not see that coming."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4252880-annie", "userReview": "Suzanne is a social worker who is under fire because one of the kids under her care died. Then her own daughter disappears. Suzanne can't remember what exactly happened the morning Teigan disappeared, except for the fight they had. Did she have something to do with Teigan's disappearance? I had some suspicions about what really happened, and while I was partly correct, I did not see the actual ending coming. I liked this overall and would give it 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 for a surprising conclusion. I received an advance copy of this through NetGalley."}], "description": "She's saved so many lives.
