I am now working on my seventh Furst book a la Kindle.If Le Carre approaches the point of departure where \"spy thriller\" become serious literatire, Furst easlily transcends it.His heroes are all Liberals. In the classic sense of the term. They hate Hitler and Stalin equally. I am down with every one of them.Furst pretty much writes the same book over and over -- and I love every second of it. All of them are set in those watching-the-car-wreck-in-slow-motion years just before WWII. The setting almost always includes Paris. A kind of noir, before-the-war Paris with lots of trench coats, femme fatales and guys following you around. A restaurant he mentions in every book is La Brasserie Heininger. It has at its table 14 a bullet hole in the mirror resulting from a Bulgarian shoot out in the men's room in the 1930's. Management decided to leave it unrepaired as a memento. This was also the table where a notorious British female spy used to seduce many lovers into giving up secrets or working for British SIS. Oh yes and they have great sauerkraut -- or \"choucroute\" the French version of course.So I Google this place because I want to go there before I die. And up pops this link to Claremont.http://www.claremont.org/publications...Guess what, I am not the first winger to stumble onto Furst. Here's what they say:\"If you\u2019re a hero in an Alan Furst novel, and you are, you will do what you must; what you can. What else is there to do? In the world of Alan Furst, you will be pitilessly squeezed in the most diabolical vice ever invented for the soul of man, between the Communist neo-Machiavellians of universal history and the fascist neo-Machiavellians of national romanticism, whose armies and secret police, resolute in murderous cynicism, are crushing between them what is left of the moral universe of Europe, of Western civilization in the epochal years 1933-1945.\"And of Brasserie Heininger\"There, on an ordinary night, you will find \u201cmagnificent bedlam\u2014the music of forks and plates, the ring of crystal glasses touched in toast, manic conversation, unbridled laughter, shouted greetings to friends at far tables. The huge mirrors [glitter] red and gold, the waiters [run] to and fro with trays of langoustines and bottles of champagne.\u201d And the most colorful characters in the world. Kiko Bettendorf, the racing driver. The Duchess of Trent, accompanied by her deerhounds. The mysterious Mlle. M., perhaps with both her lovers.\"Alas, Google reveals there is no such place as Brasserie Henninger. However, Furst's location is aparently modelled on a real restaurant called Bofinger near the Bastille. Do they have a table 14 I wonder?"}, {"userName": "Lewis Weinstein", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein", "userReview": "ORIGINAL REVIEW ... An excellent spy story, set in Warsaw, Prague and other venues before the German invasion of Poland. ... SPOILER ALERT ... Perhaps the most intriguing aspect is the question of what was known to the French about German invasion plans ... and how that information was ignored. I am left wondering how close Furst's depiction comes to verifiable truth.UPDATE 6/2/17 ...I re-read the book and enjoyed it again. The descriptions of places and espionage activities are simply superb, as good as any I've read, and the action is fast-paced.REGARDING GERMANY'S INVASION PLANS ... It seems clear that accurate predictions of how Germany would invade France were well known long before the invasion. Churchill, for one, had figured it out and communicated his conclusions, shortly after the German occupation of the Rhineland was allowed to stand by France and Britain. The French military leaders were committed to defending their Maginot line and refused to consider or prepare for the alternative Germany was clearly preparing to execute. De Gaulle understood their folly but was unable to convince his superiors.I will be dealing with these issues, including Churchill's frustrations, in the sequel to my novel A Flood of Evil."}, {"userName": "Nancy-jo", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277585-nancy-jo", "userReview": "This is not a spy novel, but a novel of espionage and the politics of war, or in this instance, of preparation for war. Mercier is a military attache assigned to Warsaw; he collects information from the Poles and the Germans and from an insignificant seeming German engineer who has access to military plans. There is a rich cast of characters, and awonderful detailing of daily life, politics, and the lead-up to war in Warsaw and Paris. Some of the individuals are real and others are fictional. The book drops you into the intricate webs of class, relationships, and politics as they shift in response to the onset of war. Furst creates a great story of a kind of unreliable suspense -- Mercier slowly collects information that indicates that Germany will invade with blitzkrieg, but politics and bureaucrats don't believe it, and as the reader already knows, Mercier's information might have saved France from occupation. The background events are heartbreaking -- the Jews are already suffering, and the two Russian spies, a Jewish couple, realize that Russia will no longer be their home. It's a great read because it has an enthralling plot and great characters, but also because you are back in a time when great events took place, sometimes because of the most insignificant actions."}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick", "userReview": "Alan Furst is a genre master, historical spy novels set in the 30s and early 40s, whose sense of history comes from Tolstoy and understanding of the scale of human drama comes from the short stories of Chekov and Joyce. Furst\u2019s novels are compact. The action occurs on the margins of great events. They have the ring of truth in their every detail, whether it\u2019s a period detail or the details of how real events play out with small climaxes and anti-climaxes. The tales remain satisfying because even though the end isn\u2019t one of Hollywood splash (your exploding triumph), the scale is personal so there is relief in survival, in small victories of hard-earned knowledge and grace under fire.Each Furst novel is, if not better than its predecessor at least as good. I\u2019ve read six or seven of the ten he\u2019s written. The Spies of Warsaw is one of the ones that is simply as good as its predecessors, not better. A French military attach\u00e9 in Warsaw works with the Poles and Russians to learn more about Nazi war plans. The plot is complemented by a love story and complicated by a vendetta from a Nazi thug who takes personally Colonel Mercier\u2019s interruption of his kidnapping of a German source. Not to give away the end because history does that, the French are convinced that the Germans can be thwarted if not deterred by the Maginot Line. Mercier discovers that there is no evidence in German armaments or maneuvers to suggest that the Germans are planning to contend with the Maginot Line. Instead their preparations seem aimed at something more shall we say Belgian. So Mercier\u2019s information, which should blow the whistle on things, has the surprisingly opposite effect, convincing France\u2019s war staff and politicians of their original position. Mercier\u2019s information is a clever Nazi plot to mislead the French\u2014no evidence becomes evidence. (Echoes of Iraq anyone?) Furst\u2019s writing is wonderfully spare and precise, evocative without straining for effect. His dialogue is crisp and real. The storytelling intelligent. It\u2019s a very good book."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153-ann", "userReview": "There are a number of reasons why this mediocre spy book (I hesitate to call it a novel, as that implies something undeserved in the way of characterization, plot development, aesthetic sense, or relation to reality) over-irked me, but I\u2019ll spare you all but the biggest: we have here a Warsaw of the late 1930s which, remarkably, is populated solely by war-hating-yet-honorable aristocrats and shabby-yet-dignified proles who all despise Hitler, harbor no anti-Semitism, and (even correcting for the magical ability of the French to all sound like political philosophers) speak in ways that bear little resemblance to how people talk in real life. I guess it\u2019s only natural to want to spare your protagonists from the ugly contemporary prejudices, but if people had really been like that, methinks there would have been no need for a World War II.

At the heart of this story is Jean-Francois Mercier, a very honorable soldier in what he considers a very dishonorable position -- the military attach\u00e9 at the French Embassy.Unhappily, he is the spymaster whose main duty is to gather information about Nazi military plans towards France as he unwillingly cultivates his sources and reluctantly moves within the embassy's social circles. As his interactions begin to bear fruit, Jean-Francois begins to understand that he must try to sound the alarm and bring his superiors to put aside their delusions. His prescience of war comes through several times as his story unfolds.The best part of this book for me is the picture of pre-war Warsaw as a cosmopolitan city -- which is the idea I grew up with -- but which is so rarely seen in Western literature. It is also important to remember that both France and Germany were not monolithic societies. France had great internal divisions about its future relationship with Germany and greatly underestimated Nazi intentions and dismissed its military strength. Germany also had pockets of resistance from different sides throughout the regime's reign.** A couple of pet peeves ...It is difficult for a non-Polish-speaking writer to get grammar correct but titles should be pretty simple; plus, Anna would have been addressed by her professional title within her wider social circle.And now I am wondering where the substory ending in the BBC movie came from **"}, {"userName": "Branwen Sedai *of the White Ajah*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701086-branwen-sedai-of-the-white-ajah", "userReview": "Warsaw, 1938.

It's not even a time period that I overly enjoy reading about. Although of course after this I will say my interest has been piqued! I'm not too familiar with 'spy' novels or novels involving espionage and politics and whatnot. But this book made me fall in love. It made me fall in love with the characters, with the beauty of France and Poland, despite the brevity of war not far on the horizon. It made me fall in love with Alan Furst's writing, which was deeply evocative and achingly beautiful. There is just....something about this novel that really struck a chord in me.

I am quickly approaching the end of my Furst 'Soldiers of the Night' jag and thus far it has been a fascinating experience. His character-driven novels could easily be bound into one gigantic prewar novel. They all swirl and fugue with similar themes, many of the same characters, and the same dark ambiance. He is detail oriented, historically accurate, writes well AND is one of the best atmosphere writers around. He leaves you feeling the grit, the cold, and the tongue of the WWII night. He is a first-class genre writer that while not quite in the le Carr\u00e9 aristocracy, is certainly in the spy-Master ruling class. 'Spies of Warsaw' is centered around a French military attach\u00e9 in Warsaw who is struggling with a growing sense of urgency about the inevitable crash of Nazi Germany tanks into France and Poland, while also dealing with a satchel filled with unreliable allies, reluctant spies and self-serving superiors.For reference, I've included below the 14 books of the Night Soldiers series along with my star rating:  1.

The pity is that he is none of these things. The filters obviously omit Brit contenders like John Le Carre, Frederick Forsyth, Ian Fleming and one his novels are very comparable with: Eric Ambler. A look at lists of top US spy novelists reveals Tom Clancy, Martin Cruz Smith, Donald Hamilton (Matt Helm) and Edward S Aarons (Sam Duvell) while Furst is nowhere.'Spies of Warsaw' is a weak romance without tension. Furst uses maps (Warsaw 1937, Paris 1939) and little details in his novels to show verisimilitude but you simply do not need to know the street the French Embassy was in in Warsaw before the war. Confidential discussions take place and secret names are revealed without a thought at cafe tables. No one worries about the enemy's ears. Melodrama is used to supply what tension there is outside the characters. Possible crisis moments are wasted. In the 'Black Front' section two Soviet GRU agents, Victor and Malka Rozen, are to be evacuated by aircraft. The only snag is a dairyman's cart that blocks the road, as they are not pursued by the Russians. Then he wastes a couple of pages where nothing happens but goodbyes being said. Even Colonel Bruner comes along from Paris on the plane to no purpose. The plane taxies away and is soon a 'black dot in the sky'.Mercier has been warned by Polish Military Intelligence that the Nazis, led by August Voss of the SD, are after him and he needs to take care. Yet when he visits an arms factory he dismisses his driver, Marek. He is not even armed when three men approach to give him a beating when he comes out. He is saved by Marek who shoots the Nazi's driver and comes to his aid. \"Who were they?\" Marek said. \"No idea, Mercier said. \"They spoke German.\" \"Then why...?\" Mercier couldn't answer. He again pointlessly denies knowledge when they examine the dead Nazi driver. Then he goes home and takes his love interest out to a film. It is a wonder they didn't have a night in with slippers and pipe by the fire. So even where there should be danger and conflict everything is soon smoothed away."}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "\"Furst's papers reside at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at The University of Texas at Austin,\" says Wikipedia.

An art, which, through the passage of centuries, had been enhanced with the accoutrements of science. The story begins in Poland in late 1937. A man who looks to be a modest businessman arrives in Warsaw, briefcase in hand. He books a room at the Hotel Europejski for an assignation with his mistress, a Polish countess. All is not as it seems. The businessman is Edvard Uhl, an engineer and specialist in tank design, who lives just across the border in Breslau. There is more to Herr Uhl than meets the eye. For some time, he had had some \"dealings\" with the French military attache. Both men had worked well together for some time. But now the attache has been recalled. His replacement is Colonel Jean-Francois Mercier, born of the lesser nobility in the heart of the French countryside, a graduate of Saint Cyr (the French equivalent of West Point), where one of his classmates was a fellow officer by the name of Charles de Gaulle. Mercier is a veteran of the First World War and of the Russo-Polish War of 1920-21 (where he again renewed his acquaintance with de Gaulle). Being an attache begins as a bit of a bewildering experience for Mercier le veuf. Besides making the acquaintance of his Polish counterparts, and ingratiating himself with the diplomatic community in Warsaw through endless rounds of parties graced with scintillating conversations, bubbly champagne, and fine food, Mercier has to learn --- quickly --- the skills deemed essential for being a successful spy. In the process, he embarks upon a journey with many twists and turns. A journey in which one step too far could be his last. The stakes are high. The margins --- infinite, given the increasingly fractious relations among Poland, Germany, and France. Furst shows in this book why he is generally acknowledged as the master of the historical espionage novel. Espionage brings out both the best and most base aspects of people. In reading \" The Spies of Warsaw\", brace yourself for a thrilling and bumpy ride."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Zeldman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/568753-jeffrey-zeldman", "userReview": "Utterly absorbing; vividly real and exciting; morally complex, yet painless. Ranks with KINGDOM OF SHADOWS as an all-time best. Either will serve if you are new to Furst.This is _transparent_ storytelling: you aren't aware of words on the page, or the author's cleverness, or any of that postmodern meta bullshit. The story takes hold of you on the first page, and doesn't let go until you finish (wishing it would never end).Furst is a great novelist, a serious novelist (like Graham Greene); his themes are the big themes of all great literature. It's just that he is also incredibly entertaining. That sounds like a good thing -- and for readers, it is. But the critical establishment tends not to reward popular, readable fiction.An exciting, quickly absorbed novel that provides an uncanny sense of living in another time: prewar Poland, 1937. As in all Furst, the quickly-sketched characters are memorable and vividly real, the drama unfolds quickly and unpredictably, and the reading experience is both tense and exhilarating.

The whole of Europe is expecting war to descend, but no-one knows when or where.

I am now thoroughly hooked on Furst and his talents as a writer of historical espionage. His details are pitch perfect, his research laudable. He takes his time to develop plot and characters, rather than showing the cloak and dagger prowess of espionage agencies and their operatives.

I wouldn\u2019t rank this one among his best, but it was very good. Like all of Furst\u2019s books, it derives poignancy from the hindsight that, despite the best efforts of the protagonist, interwar Europe was doomed.The protagonist, Colonel Mercier (the French military attach\u0117 in Poland) is running a spy within the German armaments industry, hoping to learn what Germany\u2019s war plans are in regard to France. Everything is based on partial information and guesses, but it\u2019s obvious that the Germans are very keen on tanks. Mercier tries to alert his superiors to the danger posed by the German Panzer forces, but the French general staff is determinedly expecting a reprise of the last war.Like most of Furst\u2019s books, there are plenty of shady characters in trenchcoats, a love affair, world weary veterans of the trenches, and Nazi spies. (Any fan of Indiana Jones movies will tell you that Nazis make the best villains.)

And so it is with The Spies of Warsaw, which traces the convoluted life of Jean-Francois Mercier in the lead up to the Second World War, and his various dalliances and missions. The plotting is slow and ponderous at times, and occasionally a little clunky, but Furst works to draw the reader in and tug them along, and as with previous books the narrative is highly informative, detailing the place, social relations and politics of the era. The characterisation is, for the most part, excellent, though some of the Nazi thugs and French military personnel drift toward caricature at times. The story itself was quite muted and although the tension should have been ratcheted up at certain points, as Mercier undertook dangerous missions, the narrative really lacked an edge. The biggest let down, however, was the ending: the book very nearly sailing through the air as I read the last paragraph.

He has written 10 novels about World War II, primarily espionage or other secret activities. I have devoured all 10. This novel is the most recent of the those, more or less hot off the presses. What I like about Furst's novels is that he puts me in a time and place with memorable effect. When I finished \"The Spies of Warsaw\" I felt as if I'd been living in Warsaw in the late '30s. A map of the city is even included. I enjoyed referring to it, not a distraction, and enhancer that broke not the fictional dream. So many books of this sort (war, spies, etc.) deal only with Western Europe,and I like it that Furst not only takes me to Paris, Berlin, and London, he also sends me to the east of those familiar spots.

I'm not really sure what they were talking about. I patiently listened to this book (on CD), the the viewpoints of B characters that were comically two-dimensional and pointless, really. I kept waiting to know more about the hero of the book, but his internal dialogue kept me wanting the entire time. He was most likable when thinking about his home and dogs, but that had become a very depressing thing. There doesn't appear to be more going on in his head than in the film, in fact it seems like there's less going on except a more pointed hatred towards the diplomatic parties he must attend.The character development just isn't here i'm afraid. In the movie he goes out of his way to make sure certain people are cared for, in the book he simply completes his assignment, nothing more. He feels slighted at the end that the people in France didn't take him more seriously...i just don't understand why. He doesn't give them a reason to believe him really. It was much clearer in the film than in the book, and in the film he doesn't just roll over. In the film there are several storylines that don't even take place in the book at all, that really added to the action and drama, to why i liked the film. A conflict in the workplace, for instance, was simply lacking in the book entirely. His friend said the Embassy would be unhappy about his relationship but that didn't even happen. I was expecting there to be even more detail about these characters in the book only to discover that they don't exist in the book at all or had been built off a character that only exists for one scene or chapter. The romantic problems caused by the triangle don't even exist in the book but comprise most of the film, so they end up being very different things, and a throwaway line from the book also comprises most of the second half of the film: is the information provided by one of the spies he recruited trustworthy or too good to be true?This book ends prematurely. The film takes the outline provided by the book and runs with it, gives it depth and flavor, and even it felt incomplete in some ways. There's not much to prefer about the book, really. His romantic interest has a better education and job but not much of a personality. His best friend only seems to share a love of breakfast pastry. One of his coworkers is a matchmaker. He has an odd sexual history with his cousin. His daughters seem to avoid him as much as possible, why? If a woman shows a romantic interest, hey, why not jump into bed with her? He's not very heroic, not like some of the more minor characters, and he's the only spy in Warsaw that the book really focuses on, there certainly aren't any spies OF Warsaw so the title is nonsense. I had no idea this was a series, so maybe the film drew on other books, or if they came up with their own ending based on history. But i've finally found a book that i didn't think was better than the movie, shocking."}, {"userName": "Tripfiction", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24495694-tripfiction", "userReview": "Novel set in Warsaw (\"..a polished piece of writing..\")At the French embassy in 1937 Warsaw, the French military attach\u00e9 Colonel Mercier is trying to deal with the problem of a somewhat feckless agent, Herr Edward Uhl. Soon, he is drawn into a world of intrigue and betrayal and is forced to embark on some dangerous missions himself. It doesn\u2019t take him long to work out that Hitler plans to go around the Maginot line and invade through Belgium. He duly reports his findings but Official France chooses to ignore it. Pretty typical spy stuff.Most spy novels I\u2019ve tried seem to be full of heroic characters, able to rise above self-interest in their country\u2019s cause, but Furst gives us real people. Uhl is a rather pathetic, self serving little man who has been duped and seduced into betraying his country and Mercier is an interesting character, not without flaws, who is equally at ease scrambling around a forest at night, spying on German troop movements and in the sophisticated world of the cocktail party.Another obvious difference between Spies of Warsaw and most other spy fiction is that the plot is comparatively simple. Well, I could follow it, so it must be. True, Mercier steps out of his main mission to involve himself in a passionate affair which becomes entwined in the espionage but the main story rattles along at a fair old lick and completely engages the reader.Furst, however, does more than that. This is a really polished piece of writing in which he recreates 1937 Warsaw vividly and poignantly. The reader is sharply aware that the elegant cafes where Mercier meets his colleagues would soon be under threat and that the pampered lives of his social set would soon disappear, never to return. \u201cAt mid afternoon, the Caf\u00e9 Cleo was a perfect sanctuary: marble tables, black-and-white tiled floor, a bow window looking out on the avenue, where a less-favoured world hurried by.\u201d But Furst is equally skilful in his portrayal of the back alleys and smoky workers\u2019 bars on the Vistula River where some of the dirtiest deeds are perpetrated and he never neglects to frequently remind the reader that war is just around the corner. In the German town of Glogau, Uhl\u2019s home town, we are told that there is a toy shop that \u2018had stood there for years, closing only briefly, when the Jewish owner abruptly left for the city, then reopening in a day or two, the glass in the windows replaced by the new owner\u2019."}, {"userName": "Denis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1729623-denis", "userReview": "The best thing about this novel (and about all of Furst's novels, from what I have glimpsed) is that it manages to recreate the atmosphere of Europe between the two world wars in a very realistic, believable way, but also with an almost excruciating emotion: something very bittersweet emanates from Furst's writing, and from the condemned Europe he describes; you can grasp the tenderness the author feels for the doomed people and countries he evokes - they know what awaits them. The characters Furst feel close to keep going on fighting a gallant fight, even if they know it's a lost cause, and that makes them quite heartbreaking, without fake sentimentality. There's nothing much going on in terms of plot - which is, somehow, very refreshing for a spy novel: it doesn't function solely on the basis of a tight, convoluted storyline, nor on a complex but artificial structure as so many novels of this kind do. Things happen, but in an almost casual way, the way they probably did. Everybody is more or less mixed in some dubious affair - from Warsaw to Paris to Berlin, the deliquescence of the whole European world spreads like a disease, and men, women, clerks, aristocrats, spies, ordinary people try to find their way, to do what their conscience tell them to do, and to survive. Read this book for its atmosphere, and for its quiet painting of a world on the verge of collapsing: that's what make it so distinctive and beguiling. It's as if a whole civilization is crumbling in a whisper. And you know that, in many ways, the Europe that will reemerge later on will never be the same, for better and for worse."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1047783-richard", "userReview": "I am so happy to have \"discovered\" Alan Furst. This is my third of his, and though I think \"Night Soldiers\" was a masterpiece and got 5 stars from me, Spies of the Balkans, and The Spies of Warsaw are damned good. John Le Carre, master that he is, has never written a character I've been able to warm up to. Ice water in the veins. A certain lack of flesh and blood. Alan Furst, though not the stylist that Le Carre is gives us warm blooded characters - many of whom I've actually liked, and who I worry about until the book ends - and you have to worry that long because anything could happen on one of Furst's final page. Now I find out that The Spies of Warsaw is actually one of a series of 12, and I've read the 1st, 10th, and 11th. So far the characters have been different, only the war remains the same.The Spies of Warsaw concerns a French intelligence officer working in, yes, Warsaw, and Furst works his usual magic with mileu, atmosphere, and plot. There's a love story that is nicely written and erotic, and enough underplayed derring-do down dark alleys, and in sleazy hotels to keep the noir noir.These books are well researched, and therefore educational - or maybe a better word is informative - and very, very entertaining."}, {"userName": "Elli", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4199685-elli", "userReview": "Fantastic! Amazing! The last in a series of espionage novel, although this is actually second to last in the sequence of their being written. It really doesn't matter that much. Each can be a stand alone! This deals with the international espionage community in Warsaw before World War II in the late thirties and ends with the Vichy government taking hold in France capitulating to the Nazi takeover and the resistance government establishing in London under Gen. de Gaulle after a roller coaster of happenings headquartered in Warsaw. The hero is an interesting and quite strongly dedicated person, another who wouldn't choose it to be that way, anything but, but does end up throwing his life on the line several times in order to at least try to gain the objective. Running the gamut of emotions and espionage at thriller level is also a given, at least for Alan Furst. A highly recommended book, part of a highly recommended series. And after reading, another given is a much more in depth perception of this period in european history and most likely a better and more in depth knowledge of eastern Europe and some of its history which alot of Americans like myself really do not have."}], "description": "NOW A MINISERIES ON BBC AMERICA STARRING DAVID TENNANTAn autumn evening in 1937.
