I was impressed with how author Kristy Cambron wove together the two stories -- and how the lives of the main characters intersected. Yes, there is romance in the novel, but even more, Cambron explores the questions: Is it possible to find beauty in the darkest of places, the most heartbreaking of times? And how can we hold on to God when we have every reason to give up hope?"}, {"userName": "Jenna ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24806763-jenna", "userReview": "Young Adele is a prodigy in her country of Austria in the late 30's early 40's. She has a talent when it comes to playing the violin, so much so that as a teenager she occasionally is invited to play with the Vienna Philharmonic.It is during her time with the Philharmonic that she meets Vladimir, the son of a merchant who is beneath what her parents would expect her to date, yet she falls in love with him.During this time in Austria, Hitler declares war and curfews are set in motion and the Jewish population are either in hiding or have been sent on a train to what they want people to believe is a working camp. Due to certain circumstances, Adele ends up on the wrong side of the war and gets to see what the concentration camps are really all about.The story then changes to modern day where a young woman who owns an art gallery is in search of an original painting that she saw as a young girl of Adele and her violin and is also in search of what became of Adele and whether or not she died during her time as a prisoner.I thought that the story of Adele was so captivating that when it would change to Sera and a guy named William who is helping her find this painting that I would lose interest in the book. I thought that the other tale of Sera was not cohesive enough to be intertwined with the story of Adele. I believe that if the book had been only Adele's story that I would have given it a strong five stars. Toward the end when everything seemed to come together, I wasn't so invested because I wasn't as interested in Sera but was instead reading about Sera while Adele's life was summarized in conversation where it would have been stronger to rid of Sera's story and see Adele's through action. But of course that is my opinion.I suppose that it's hard to switch stories when one is so gut-wrenching. I also had trouble with the believability that Sera at such a young age owns an art gallery in New York City and that William is in charge of liquidating his families assets when he is so young as well. It is possible, yes, but for the two to come together it just seemed unlikely to me and I just didn't get into them so well.As the story went along, I picked up on the fact that it was a Christian book and in most cases this can be distracting to me if it becomes too preachy or has a slew of Bible verses. In the story of Adele and Sera it is presented in a way that isn't distracting and actually makes you stop and think about how Adele's role as a Christian while being imprisoned with other Jewish women didn't sway Adele's views or the other women's about accepting each other, but how they used their own religions to unite and keep each other strong.Although I wasn't crazy about the joining of a modern day story because I was so invested in Adele's story, I still highly recommend this book. It is a great tale of love, acceptance, and turning fear into bravery."}, {"userName": "Naomi Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40096835-naomi-sarah", "userReview": "Wow. Wow. Just  WOW.  This book, to say in the least, is  ART. It's not just any kind of art; it's literal, actual, stunning, gorgeous, melancholy, heart-tugging  ART.  Kristy Cambron...  I want to write like you.  The way she writes, man... I seriously don't have the words to describe how beautifully  beautifully  this book was written. The way the music was revealed to me; the aching violin notes. The way the romance was written; adorable and sad and gorgeous. The way the horrors of Auswhitz were revealed; so painfully terrible but yet so gorgeously and ACHINGLY written.I say it again.  THIS BOOK IS ART. I suppose I should review this in an orderly manner now, like I always do. Okay, so.  What I liked: 1. The writing. Duh.2. ADELE. She was amazing. REALLY amazing.3. VLADIMIR. CAN I HAVE HIM THANKS. (Seriously though, the Adele+Vladimir scenes melted my heart.) (I want someone to call me Butterfly.)4. I was surprised how much I liked the present-time chapters. Of course, not half as much as the war-chapters (thank goodness there were more of those), but I did enjoy them.5. IT WAS JUST GORGEOUS.6. All of it.7. I really cannot say much but that. The story was amazing, the writing blew me away, I loved the characters to bits, I WAS there.  This book is like a vivid, vivid movie.  What I didn't like as much: 1. Not much. :-) I didn't like the present-time scenes as much - and sometimes they bored me sliiightly. William annoyed me sometimes; although he won me over by the end.GAH.

I received a review copy before it ever went to print, but my attention only turned its way when Cambron released a sequel. I'm not a fan of starting in the middle so, naturally, I felt I had no choice and promptly bumped book one of the Hidden Masterpiece series to the top of my TBR. I cracked it open and to be perfectly honest, I fell in love with it. There was a lot of intrigue in the contemporary mystery surrounding the painting and I liked the inherent conflict of the 1942 premise. I didn't think much of William, Sera or Adele, but I quickly grew to appreciate supporting cast members like Vladimir, Penny and Omara. The pacing was great, I loved the amount of authentic detail offered in the Auschwitz scenes, and I thought the back and forth movement between the two storylines very well-done. I still think that, but none of it makes up for the elements I didn't appreciate.The early chapters of the novel incorporated light religious references that complimented the situational drama of the narrative, but Cambron mounts a soapbox in the tail end of the story and infuses her novel with so much faith that the fictional elements of the novel fade into obscurity. Some readers of Christian fiction like this treatment and I can respect that, but I am not one of them. I have no problem with religion, if I did I wouldn't have picked up the book, but Cambron got so caught up in her message that she lost sight of the story she'd created and that is something I can't ignore. Bottom line, I felt The Butterfly and the Violin started strong, but it lost its way and never recovered. The story had tons of potential, but lacks balance between its fictional elements and faith-based themes and at the end of the day, I admit it is a piece I'd have great difficulty recommending alongside the American Family Portrait series by Cavanaugh or the Zion Covenant books by Thoene."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah", "userReview": "This story is simply exquisite. Adele makes one decision to help a friend and loses everything, being sent to Auschwitz after being sentenced to \"eight weeks of reeducation\" for her actions. She is not Jewish, and her father is a high-ranking officer in the Third Reich, but that does not save her from a horrific experience in the concentration camp. I was not aware that prisoner orchestras were forced to play during the arrivals and executions of other prisoners. I had heard that musicians and doctors had a higher chance of survival than others, but not why. I don't think I could manage to step up and keep playing in such circumstances, and it was no surprise to read of the high suicide rate among the players. Add to that the story of Sera James, the art dealer who is trying to find a painting made of Adele and her violin. The jumps in timeline were expertly executed and easy to follow.Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332895-lori", "userReview": "This was another historical fictional novel that wove the past with the present and, yet again, I enjoyed the past story more!

I feel like it was supposed to be a deeply profound and beautiful book, but it wasn't that for me. I don't know if it all just went over my head, or it just wasn't very well written, but it didn't cut it for me. I LOVE WW2 stories, but honestly, I was more interested in Sera and William's story than I was in Adele's. I really like both Sera and William's characters; they had a lot of depth, and I wanted to know more. I wasn't a huge fan of how much emphasis was placed on physical attraction, (Seriously, you met the guy 48 hours ago, and we are already kissing?!?!??) but that's just me. Overall, just kind of a \"meh\" read for me. I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series, as I am curious how Sera and William's story will play out, and if I will like it any better than this one.

Her search to find the painting and to identify the woman in it has taken her to discover Holocaust Art. As she delves more and more into the painting's story, Sera's search leads her to William Hanover, the heir to the massive Hanover estate. Sera and William join forces to find the owner of the painting for different reasons - Sera to discover the story and William to present the owner with court documents contesting the ownership. Yet there's so much to the story than either of them can even begin to imagine. As they delve into the mystery of the painting, they find themselves swept away into the story of Adele von Bron, an Austrian violinist who risked everything to save one Jewish family. Adele is the sweetheart of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in 1942. Her father is a high ranking official in the Third Reich. Yet one evening changes her life forever, and she's forced to question all that she's been taught to believe. Can her violin save her life deep in a Nazi death camp? And can Sera find the answers she so desperately seeks while fighting her attraction to William?This book has been on my reading list for ages. Literally. The cover and the title intrigued me.

So when I finally managed to bump this up my to read list and delve into it, I was thrilled.There are two stories going on here. There is the modern one with Sera and William. Then there's the WWII one of Adele. While I enjoyed both, Adele's story truly fascinated me. Here is this girl who isn't Jewish and appears to have it all going for her. Yet she defies her father to assist the man she loves. She pays a great price for that later too. I loved getting a different look at history. Adele's life is one of survival. She is forced to play her violin at Auschwitz as others are marched to their deaths. Does the experience change her? Yes it does!

After turning the last page, I had to ask myself, Who are you, Kristy Cambron? WWII historian, student of fine art, musician extraordinaire, romantic, world traveler, wordsmith, a worshipper completely in tune with God - this could very well describe Kristy because all of those elements are embodied in this beautifully crafted story. Kristy's words grabbed my heart from the beginning and I don't think I will ever forget these characters.Only once before have I described a novel as having the Wow! factor, but I do it here without hesitation. Plot, setting, characters and writing style all combine to make this story a riveting, mesmeric read. This novel should appeal to historical romance fans, but it goes so much deeper than that in its theme of survival and hope. The use of contrast was haunting - beauty in the midst of evil, hope in the midst of darkness, and the use of a gift to bring God glory vs. the effort to only survive.I don't often read stories that involve the Holocaust because I just have a hard time with the extremes to which mankind's unfathomable cruelty can reach, but Kristy does several things that made this a hard-to-put-down read. First, the scenes that take place at Auschwitz are not exceptionally graphic, yet the pictures are real, vividly clear, and chilling. While traveling in a cattle car to Auschwitz, Adele reflects with these poignant words: \"Mothers. Lost sons. Violinists who had no concept of the real world before that moment. Daughters. Frightened families. So many strangers. They were all packed in together, young and old, never having met but oddly connected by their crossed paths on this terrible, frightening journey.\"Secondly, two connected stories are woven together in The Butterfly and the Violin - the story of Adele Von Bron, the ethereal violinist whose eyes are opened to the harshness of the Holocaust, and that of Sera James, a modern-day NYC gallery owner searching for Adele's haunting portrait. Sera and William's story is lighter, romantic, and humorous - and I welcomed the breathing space it provided from the dark and intense story of Adele and Vladimir. Both stories have heroes and tender romantic elements that I loved.Another factor is the way musical themes were woven throughout. I've been a worship musician almost all my life and could so easily relate when Adele reflects how music was \"her act of worship to her Creator\" and how it carried her into communion with God. But as the Auschwitz Orchestra played for the laborers marching out in the morning and those returning at night - or for the arrival of the trains - Adele's playing took on a different meaning: \"She'd play for the world's loss of innocence and the coldness of hate that fought to overshadow the love she knew to be born of God.\" Most moving of all is the theme of God's love and constant presence, regardless of circumstance or what we might perceive as unanswered prayer. You don't have to look very hard to find Jesus Christ in this narrative, and it always seems that our faith grows stronger when we have nowhere else to turn. Omara, who was like a den mother to the orchestra girls, was an unforgettable character. She came to love Adele like a daughter, and I'll end with her moving words: \"This, child, is our worship. To live and survive and play to God from the depths of our souls. This is the call that binds us. When we worship in the good times, it brings God joy. But worship in the midst of agony? That is authentic adoration of our Creator.\"The Butterfly and the Violin is a masterpiece to which I give my highest recommendation.

Fans of heartwarming historical fiction will love this new breathtaking novel from debut author Kristy Cambron. Switching between two different time periods and point of views, this story takes you an unforgettable journey of two women-one during WWII inside a concentration camp, and the other in the present day tracking down art from the concentration camps. As a devoted fan of WWII historical fiction, I was very excited to learn of this new book which is set in my favorite time period setting for historical fiction. My very first impression of this book was how breathtaking the cover is. While I knew it held so much beauty even before reading the novel, after reading the poignant story within its pages, I have an even greater love for the cover, and all it represents in the story with the painting that Sera is tracking of Adele. This novel completely blew me out of the water. I had a feeling it would be good, but I didn't expect that it would end up on my favorite books read in 2014 list! For a debut novel, I'd have thought that this was not the first book by this author, as the writing style shows experience and a seasoned writing style, making it hard for me to believe it was only this author's first novel! Kristy has been gifted with the ability to take words on a page of paper and turn them into a story, breathing life into the characters and weaving a true masterpiece that moves you just as much as the painting of Adele did for those in the story. This novel has such heart and emotion, and was written in such a way that you can't help but be touched in a positive way. Kristy wrote about the horrendously unjust time in history where innocent Jews were killed all for the sake of power. She wrote it in such a poignant way that I just couldn't help but feel as if I were in the concentration camps alongside Adele and the others who were there with her. While lots of Holocaust historical fiction is usually known for producing this emotion, I felt like this experience was different than others I've had with other fiction set during this time. The author just has such a wonderful way with words, and this novel was truly one of the most unique novels I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The way that the power of music and art were woven into the storyline made for such a touching addition to the novel. I loved how the author wove the beauty of life into the story by emphasizing how music can be a form of worship to the Lord, as we saw ultimately displayed in Adele's life. Aside from the sheer beauty and radiance of this novel, and the story it tenderly tells, the characters were another part of this story that I loved. This novel was extremely unique, since it switches between two different time periods and point of views, making for an interesting reading experience. In the story we get to know Adele who lived during WWII, and we also meet Sera who is living in the present day, tracking down a portrait of Adele painted long ago. Both women have a touching story in this novel, and the development of both of their characters is such a beautiful thing to see take place on the page, and was done so well. I'd only read one other novel sharing two point of views/time periods before, and really liked how this part of the story added to the storyline and overall theme, adding advantages to the reading experience that I enjoyed greatly. Overall, this novel was such a touching one. I got so swept away in the story, and truly felt the characters emotions, and will forever remember Adele's legacy - even more so the because of the real people who's stories of concentration camp life were similar to Adele's fictional one. Even though Adele's story is a work of fiction, I love how it reflects upon to true stories of those who did suffer in the concentration camps. That fact that what Adele went through was based on real events added another dimension to the story, making it a truly beautiful masterpiece. I loved the way music was incorporated into the story as a form of worship to the Lord, and loved how Kristy really drove home the fact that music has the power to move people, and is a wonderful thing when used for the Lord's glory. I feel so blessed to have been able to read this book, and treasure it as a favorite! I would highly recommend this novel to any historical fiction fans, and eagerly await future novels by this author!

Thoroughly captivating. Beautifully so, in poignantly painful and bittersweet ways.

We live by working, and we work for God.\" The contemporary thread gave a reprieve from the weighted sorrow and heaviness of the historical components. It was light and fresh, woven with mystery and an air of romance. However, I thought it a bit too melodramatic at times. Along the lines of chick-lit, with its coquettish love-blushing crescendos and BFF trills. \"I distinctly remember the last time I set you up on a double date, you called it quits and left the pub by seven thirty, even though I had dug up a marginally cute guy who was willing to pay for dinner and a movie.

I always intended to look up her book, but never got around to it. Then I met Kristy herself. She dropped by first-timer's orientation at the ACFW conference in September, taking time to meet and greet a roomful of scared, excited newbies with a love for writing. We stopped and talked, and she signed a poster for me. Then we talked a bit more as we walked down the halls to the main session. I loved her bright spirit and the way she paid attention to the needs of people around her. I knew I wanted to buy her book as soon as I could. The next night, I walked down to the conference area for a worship and writing session, only to bump into another conference attendee. \"Kristy's doing a talk on Bible verse mapping downstairs,\" she said. \"It's an impromptu thing; a bunch of people were interested.\" I originally came down to work like crazy on my newest novel outline. Instead, I went straight to the room where Kristy was speaking and heard an inspiring way of studying Scripture, with careful attention to the correct meaning in its pages. Through that talk, I knew that hers was a heart for Jesus that I really, really wanted to put some support towards. As soon as I came home, I picked up The Butterfly and the Violin at our local Christian bookstore. It was just as beautiful as I hoped and thought it would be. This story is so subtle and beautiful. That's what I look for in Christian fiction--subtlety and beauty woven together into a masterpiece of grace and growth. Even the cover has a beauty that a lot of classic readers are starved for--the painting, distressed look that doesn't need a lot of bright colors and sharp photography to grab the attention. Adele's deep despair playing music in the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz as prisoners marched to work and execution gripped my heart. The romance between her and Vladimir was sweet and welcome. The plotting was excellent, with the way her modern counterparts, Sera and James worked through the mystery piece by piece, as their story flipped back and forth with Adele's. I love the way Kristy uses objects. A violin. A photograph. A butterfly clip. Poppy lipstick. Each object held deep significance, and appeared again and again throughout the story in a way that added skilled imagery and word play. I love the way she used art--I don't recall ever reading a fiction story that made the celebration of art so special. The use of painting and music to connect soul to God using the abilities He gives us. She doesn't shy away from it, or downplay it as less important than other aspects of faith. Christian art was one of the central themes of the story. In Sera and William's story, mentions of \"Mr. California Cool\" and men's cologne weren't up my alley. There are moments throughout the story where the subtlety and uniqueness shifts into familiar phraseology of Christian romance. A couple of modern words in the historical story jerked me out of the moment. But those were small things, and I wasn't opposed to the modern storyline being included. I really appreciated that William wasn't a grouch throwing obstacles in Kristy's way, but a surprisingly warm-hearted and friendly young man. The outdoor rehearsal dinner was an especially vivid scene, and many of the elements had an air of things the author herself knew and enjoyed. I don't know. That's strictly a guess. But I loved it for that.The heart of the story--love, beauty, art, suffering--beat strong and clear at every turn, making this a soul-enriching experience. I look forward to more of Kristy's work in future.

Sera is an art dealer who becomes fascinated by a painting she saw once as a girl\u2014of a young female violinist with piercing blue eyes. It\u2019s a painting of haunting beauty, and Sera is compelled to chase it down.As she does, we discover the subject is Adele Von Bron, once a celebrated Austrian violinist, who ends up imprisoned in a concentration camp for smuggling Jews out of Vienna. Surprisingly, the painting was not commissioned when Adele was rich and famous. Instead, the canvas captures Adele the prisoner, who found a way to honor God with her music even in Auschwitz, an Adele matured & refined by suffering.\n\n    We learn that this particular masterpiece so captivates Sera because it speaks of hope in the worst of circumstances\u2014and that\u2019s what I love about this story.\nFor Adele\u2019s story is one of hope and joy amidst heartbreak and loss.

Finding it becomes an overriding passion. The painting is of a young woman a violinist. The story then flips back from New York to Vienna to give the reader the background and story of the Austrian violinist Adele. Adele Von Bron is the daughter of a high-ranking member of the Third Reich so how did she end up in Auschwitz and did she survive her time there? These are questions Sera and the reader wants answered. The passages set in Auschwitz and are hard to read but they are interspersed with the lighter modern day story of Sera and relationship between her and William, who is also looking for the painting. They team up to find it. Can she trust him?There is a lot of switching between the stories of Adele and that of Sera and William and therefore many changes in time. While I can see the sense in the way it was written and all the changes there were still it annoyed me a little. I think I am weary of this way of telling a story. While I found this an interesting read, I never felt compelled to pick it up at every spare moment and actually read another book in the middle. Those who enjoy fiction with a strong Christian message should enjoy it. For me, at times it felt a touch heavy handed, but overall a readable story that deals with the atrocities of an episode in history that should never be forgotten. And for the romantic there is definitely a romance or two."}, {"userName": "Jesseca Wheaton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39986158-jesseca-wheaton", "userReview": "This was probably the first book I'd read where the author is writing in two different time periods; present day and WWII. I found the book quite fascinating and the two different plots winding throughout the pages kept me quite busy trying to find out how in the world it would all end. And then just when I thought I had it figured out, there was a new twist I hadn't expected. The book shows the stark reality of what prisoners experienced at Auschwitz as well as the horrors of the SS, but at the same time it was incredibly beautiful. The message that was woven through the pages was timeless and literally draws you into the story. I'm looking forward to reading the 2nd book in the series!"}, {"userName": "Brandy Vallance", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3776035-brandy-vallance", "userReview": "The Butterfly and the Violin is AMAZING. I so enjoyed reading this story. Beautiful, intriguing, high tension in just the right places, and two great romances. I was struck by this part of history that I had never heard about--a woman's orchestra in Auschwitz! This book made me FEEL and during one particular scene, I had the thought that The Butterfly and the Violin should be required reading in schools. Because of current events and human rights, it is so important not to forget this time period in history. Not since reading The Book Thief have I been so touched. I loved the parallel stories and the mystery of the painting. Adelle and Victor captured my heart!

The hope and strength found in the dismal days of WWII and the fight to survive even when every bone in your body is telling you to submit and end the fight to live was able to heal the present day characters. I don't always give glowing reviews to fictional stories written about WWII because I find they lack the true raw emotion one finds in the reality of the times.

I tend to turn a harsh eye towards the stories and not let them try and romanticizes me into feeling for them."}, {"userName": "Annelies", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54055616-annelies", "userReview": "Een prachtige historische roman het verhaal begint in 2014 met Sera en William dan ga je terug naar het jaar 1942 tweede wereldoorlog dan stap je in het leven van Ad\u00e8le zo verspring je iedere keer weer in de levens van ieder en in hun liefdesverhalen maar wat heeft het heden en het verleden te maken met elkaar dat was in een woord prachtig.

Perhaps because I\u2019m not an art history enthusiast I found it difficult to relate to the modern day parts of the book. I did, however, enjoy the parts set during the war and felt these sections held my attention more so. What I found particularly interesting was the fact based storyline of the musicians of the Holocaust. Although I have read quite extensively of this era, I was ignorant to the talents of the prisoners which were taken advantage of by the Nazi guards. I must acknowledge the authors obvious dedication to her work and research. The book also features some interesting reading club questions for discussion and some factual basis for the writers inspiration. Overall, this was not by any means a terrible book. It just wasn\u2019t written in such a way that I felt able to be completely absorbed in it."}, {"userName": "Carissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9102458-carissa", "userReview": "Full review is at my blog Bookshelves and Daydreams.My Take in 3 PartsThe ThemeThis book reminds me a little bit of The Fellowship of the Ring, when Galadriel gives Frodo the Phial of Galadriel and tells him, \"May it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out.\"The Butterfly and the Violin is a dark, traumatic novel, but with a thread of hope carefully woven through each line of the chapters set in Auschwitz. Even in absolute and utter darkness, when 1.5 million people are dying around you, God still hears your cry and He is still faithful. The author captured the reality of a bleak era that brought me to hysterical tears, but still managed to present the idea that God is there, in the turmoil, and the grime, and the death. He hears the cries of His people and He grieves, not only for the lives lost, but for those who are doing the killing, something I hadn't quite realized until I felt that swell of anger against the Nazis, unbridled hate, and then came to realize that while I want to blindly reach back in history and kill all of the Nazis, God was grieving for them. That's quite a realization, both about God and about myself.The CharactersSo what we have here is two sets of characters, those in the 1940s and those in the current day. Sera James and William Hanover are trying to unravel the whereabouts of this piece of Holocaust art, a painting of a young woman with her hair shorn, numbers tattooed on her arm, and a violin in her hand. They take this journey together. I like both of them. Sera has been hurt before, left at the altar, and so she has trust issues, both with me and with God. Those issues, of course, are resolved by the end, which is important. William, we don't really get to know him all that well, except that he's a businessman who felt the real calling on his life was to be a minister. His story in this leads him back to that path and calling from God, and I liked that storyline.But the truly impactful character, the most prominent, is Adele Von Bron, the young woman whose portrait Sera and William are researching. It is she, a renowned young violinst from a prominent Austrian family, who tried to help Jews escape from Vienna, and ended up being sent to Auschwitz Birkenau for reeducation purposes. It is she who was forced to play for the Birkenau orchestra of prisoners, play her violin as families were split and countless innocents were sent to the gas chambers. This book is her story, and I felt every iota of weakness and terror and doubt that Adele felt during her time in Birkenau.So, while I appreciate the modern characters, I loved Adele, and even Vladimir Nicolai, the young cellist who she loves and whose passion to save Jews also found him captured by the Nazis.The WritingKristy Cambron is new on the writing scene, with this being her debut novel. If The Butterfly and the Violin is a testament to her storytelling abilities, than Christian literature is in for a revolution. Her style is fresh and original, she tells just enough of the atrocities in Auschwitz without crossing a line into the grotesque, and her heart for the era of World War II really shines, just as her expertise does in being an art historian. This is not a historical romance, but a historical novel, and I really appreciate the difference. Any romance within the book does not take precedence over the story.If I were to nitpick about one tiny thing, it's that I really don't know if the modern storyline was necessary. Then again, I'm not for novels that have dual eras most of the time, so I'm just not used to it."}, {"userName": "Ryan Dejonghe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21649558-ryan-dejonghe", "userReview": "This is my third time writing this review, but I think I\u2019ve got it. My struggle is this: I love the historical fiction and the story of the Auschwitz girl; I\u2019m not such a fan of the modern portion of story with overly convenient circumstances and borderline insta-love. Overall, I would recommend this novel based on the beauty of the entire picture and the personal lessons learned.The story of the girl of Auschwitz tells of the artists and musicians of the time. Though my interest waned in the other story with modern setting, it served well to expand the context of that girl. Heartbreaking as it was, the story taught me something new and painted the already indelible picture with greater vividness and clarity. We have all been touched by stories of this tragic time period, but music and art add something more personal and endearing.Other reviewers have made note, to which I agree, that this book moves beyond the Christian literature boundaries. Yes, faith in God is discussed, as well as scriptures quoted, but those discounting these things are themselves a disservice. This is a story that resonates with the soul, making us all better for having read it.I\u2019d be remiss not to mention the beautiful cover. I get lost staring into it.My sincere congratulations extend to Kristy Cambron for researching and penning this work. My life has been touched, and for that I\u2019m appreciative.

Adele, the Christian daughter of an Austrian military leader, was sent to Auschwitz for \"reeducation\" after she was caught attempting to smuggle out a Jewish family. Sera is a lost woman searching for a lost painting while trying to move on after heartbreak. Both women were deeply betrayed by someone they love. Both women wrestle with and find comfort in their faith while trying to overcome their struggles. Their lives become entangled and Adele's survival helps Sera succeed.
