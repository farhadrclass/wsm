Very few authors can write this type of setup and make me a believer but Maya Banks always does. Both Ash and Josie were fun characters to get to know and the chemistry between them was blazing HOT! What I especially appreciated was the fewer quantity of sex scenes. Unlike the last two books in the series, I didn't feel this one was inundated with copious amounts of sex. Instead it had the perfect blend of steamy love scenes and story plot. Steffi: I have to agree with Kristen, I loved the dynamic between Ash and Josie. I particularly enjoyed that Josie is such a free-spirit and completely different from the domineering and controlling Ash. Nonetheless, they are perfect for each other. I also liked that this book doesn't have the high amount of drama in the relationship. There is still enough drama to keep the story going but it comes from the plot rather than the romance, if that makes sense.I also greatly enjoyed the background we get of Josie's life. When she first meets Ash, she is actually in a half-hearted dom/sub relationship. I really liked how the differences were explained, what commitments had to be made and for Josie to realize that it is not a game but a lifestyle she has to choose.Crista: My quick answer to this question: A whole lot about this book worked for me!! Burn gets my vote for favorite book in this series! Ash has been a favorite of mine since the start of this series, and I am happy to report that my love for him only intensified after reading this book. I loved Ash\u2019s protective instincts when it came to Josie and there were many \u201cahhh\u201d moments as Ash set out to make Josie his. I loved the honesty in this relationship. Ash is completely up front about his past m\u00e9nage experiences, and I loved that this \u201csecret\u201d came in honesty instead of drama.\nWhat didn\u2019t work:\nKristen: It pains me to say this, but I had a very difficult time staying absorbed in this story. I found myself frequently putting the book down. I can't quite put my finger on why I felt such apathy but there was just something missing. I felt it lacked the heart-and-soul found in the first two books in this series. I don't know, maybe I've just grown tired of the millionaire man-whore who's into BDSM and falls for the innocent and impoverished girl. Who knows, maybe Maya Banks has too. Steffi: I do have to say that Burn reminded me a lot of Fever. Maybe that makes sense since Ash and Jace used to share on of the most intimate parts of life. For that to happen, they must have similar likes and dislikes and also similar taste in women. I just had great excpectations for Ash's story. He was by far my favorite character in the first two books and I would have liked him to be a little bit different from Gabe and Jace. More intense, more demanding and more erotic. While this book is steamy and I LOVED the sex scenes, Ash didn't come across as intense as he was made out to be in Rush and Fever.Crista: For me, I wish that this relationship had begun a little more gradually than it did. It was insta-lust and insta-commitment. It almost seemed like Ash looked at Gabe/Jace and wanted what they had so badly that he was looking for someone to become \u201chis\u201d. It made Josie seem a little too \u201cconvenient\u201d instead of \u201cdestined\u201d.\nBest scenes:\nKristen: I loved the ending. It fit perfectly for this series. I also loved when Gabe had to FINALLY admit to his friends about his horrendous actions in Paris and the horrible outcome of what happened. It served him right that his actions came back to haunt him. Steffi: Funnily enough, my favorite scene is actually from the beginning of the book, when Ash and Josie first meet. You can read an excerpt of that scene in our giveaway post here. This first meeting is almost magical and it's love-at-first-sight without kitsch or fanfare - it just feels very natural and is simply lovely.Crista: I have two favorite scenes. The first is the scene where Ash describes the type of Dom/Sub type of relationship that he desires with Josie. He states: \u201cOne thing you need to realize. I\u2019m not more than you, Josie. I get that there is an inequality in power in the relationship. The scales are tipped in my direction. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m more. Never more. You are everything in this equation.\u201dThe second is the scene with the girls out on the town. Maya Banks writes some seriously fun girl party scenes!\nFavorite characters:\nKristen: Jace and Bethany from the second book in the series, Fever. I just love these two characters. Steffi: I 100% agree with Kristen - Jace and Bethany remain my favorite couple. I also really liked Gabe and Mia in this book. Mia's girls' night outs are legendary and, with Bethany and Josie, even funnier than before.Crista: Ash (with Josie a close second)!Overall Thoughts:Kristen: For the most part I liked this book but I certainly didn't love it. Not like I did the second book in this series. I had a difficult time staying interested and engaged in the story. It lacked the heart-and-soul that was present in the first two books. I'm glad I read this story, though, as Maya Banks is one of my favorite authors. ~ 3.5 starsSteffi: Fever remains my favorite but Burn is a good end to a phenomenal series. Maya Banks just knows her romance and how to draw the reader in, make them care deeply for the characters. She writes intense emotion like no other and for that reason alone I recommend the Breathless Trilogy. Burn was not what I expected it to be but it was still a very enjoyable read. ~ 4 starsCrista: Burn is a truly a romantic/erotic novel. Why did I ever think that these two had to be mutually exclusive? I have to admit that I loved the intensity Ash shows Josie in this novel. I\u2019m partial towards the alpha male, and Ash certainly proves to be one of those! I also appreciate that Burn nicely wraps up this series by letting us see all the couples together from all three books. ~ 4 \u00bd stars!!!*A copy of this book was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Vikki ~ *squee* lite ~", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3758447-vikki-squee-lite", "userReview": "2.5 disappointing starsI so so wanted to like this book. And it wasn't bad - it just wasn't anything. We start again with the insta-relationship. While Ash and Josie hold off on the \"I loveYou's\" for a short while - we seriously go first meeting (which leads to the apparently inevitable stalking of the heroine) to first date, to moving in together in the first week (and they didn't even see each other in the week between the first date and the moving in talk). It felt more than a little like a re-tread of Fever. On their first date, Ash is all \"we are real\". This is long term\" yada yada. Ugh. Josie was a blah heroine - she's not the sensitive fragile heroine that Bethany was - or the independent feisty heroine that Mia was - she was just - middle of the road. She claimed she wasn't a pushover (and I guess she wasn't a total doormat) but she just agrees to everything Ash says - which was flat out insane given the speed he was moving their relationship forward. She had no spark - I couldn't connect to her at all. Then there was Ash. I've always liked Ash - he was the affable hottie with an edge. Yum. But in this book - he turned into the relationship whisperer. Half of his conversations with Josie where lectures on how relationships should work. How they should \"fight\" (touching - no putting any distance between them). How they should communicate (she always needs to tell him how she's feeling) etc. It's not that there was anything wrong with what he was saying - it was relationship 101 - but it was just too much - and really - for the guy with zero real relationship experience, the whole \"I'm and expert\" thing was a little baffling. There was also this \"shadow\" part of Ash's life - connections to apparently unsavory characters that is hinted at - but never explained. (And which lead to no less then five conversations with various people about how it wouldn't \"touch\" them. ) In general, I was bored most of the book. I didn't care about Ash and Josie's relationship - and very little - on any front happens until the last 20% of the book (and by that point I didn't care) Even the \"big conflict\" was blah. We get what felt like a re-hash of a lot of the things that happened in the other books (like girls night part trios - blech). I even started skimming the sex scenes because they weren't anything new or exciting . And if one insta relationship isn't enough - we get an extra one from the secondary characters. Overall, a seriously disappointing ending to the trilogy. I can only be glad it's over."}, {"userName": "Vina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18492568-vina", "userReview": "Am I feeling the \"Burn\" ??I always wanted to know more about Ash since his appearance in Rush as the mysterious 3rd business partner and then in Fever where you learn a bit more about the interesting connection Ash has with his best friend, Jace. But by the end I was like :The beginning of the book I just felt like Ash and Josie kept having the same conversation of what he expected from her but not what she expected from him. I just kept thinking the relationship was kinda dull. In all of these books everyone fails in love crazy fast so I expect that, but I just meet you once so move in with me was kinda out there. When Jace did that to Bethany it was a little different she was homeless. I would have like to have seen Josie resist a little bit more and have Ash really have to work to woo hoo at least for a week before she moved in.I meen I get that jace had ask Bittany to move with home and she agreed quickly because , hello , the girl was homeless .but in this book , it was just creepy .The other thing that really made me roll my eyes was the ending . I love happy ending but come on , we're suppose to be adults reading a damn book , not some children reading a fairy tale .By the end everybody get married to they prince charming and they only problem is how much kids they will have.It scream bullshit .Over all an Ok book but nothing exceptional ."}, {"userName": "Nicky", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17467346-nicky", "userReview": "This book is unreadable it is so bad. I rarely don't finish a book, but I got through 35% and could take no more. What happened to this series?? Rush was SO GOOD. Gabe Hamilton was smart and sexy. Jace in Book 2 was ridiculous. He couldn't speak a full sentence to save is life and the whole concept about falling in love with a homeless girl after 30 minutes was absurd. I had hoped that Fever was the exception in the trilogy in that it was so bad, but unfortunately that was not the case. Rush was the exception because it was actually good. Burn is a repeat of Fever.....Ash sounds like a neanderthal. Smart, educated people to not speak like that. There is a purpose to the subject in a sentence when speaking....Maya Banks seems to have forgotten that. I am all for a love at first site story, but at least make it remotely believable. In both Fever and Burn it was so wrong....the characters made no sense together and she did little to help me understand why they would be together. I am also OK with the whole Dom/Sub storyline, but this was just vulgar at times. Again, I think it had to do with a lack of development rather than the storyline (or the statements) themselves. I am beyond disappointed. And the absolutely ridiculous relationship she tries to develop between the girls in the book is nauseating. The first time I read about \"fuck me shoes\" in this book I knew I would not be finishing the book. Again, a great friendship between women is a plus in a book....this was simply silly and stupid. I'm not sure what happened in Rush to make it so good, but it was far from repeated in the rest of the Trilogy. I sent my copy back to Amazon for a refund. Hopefully I will at least get my money back. If only I could have my wasted time back."}, {"userName": "\u2606 Sammy \u2606\u5f61", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14144676-sammy", "userReview": "[Didn't find it realistic at all that Ash or Josie would want to move in together after one date!

Yeah\u2026well I was wrong. \u2018Burn\u2019 is my favorite of the three and Ash McIntrye is the biggest reason why. In the first two books Ash comes off as a little bit too laid back for my taste. I like my literary men to be complex and to have a certain intensity about them. Well\u2026in his own story he is that and more. He\u2019s proven to be a loyal and fierce friend to Gabe and Jace, but in Burn we also find out he can actually show those same characteristics to a woman\u2026that was a welcome change.You can read the rest of my review here: http://bookishtemptations.com/2013/08..."}, {"userName": "Erlynn (BooksHugBack)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5434625-erlynn-bookshugback", "userReview": "If you were looking for the third in Maya Banks' 'Breathless' series to be the steamiest of the three you will be disappointed, I sure was. 'Rush' the story of Gabe and Mia was the classic 'Beauty and the Beast' story with an erotic flair not for the faint of heart. The second novel 'Fever', had Jace turning away from his threesome ways with best friend Ash to settle down with a 'Cinderella' Bethany. I was sure Ash was the most deviant of the three and was interested to know the fairy-tale storyline and see who would change him. I was a bit disappointed as immediately after Jace and Bethany's engagement, he spots a girl Josie in the park and that's it for him. Their relationship although beautiful is severely tame considering the previous two books and even Ash's own past. The idea that Jace and Ash shared everything including women was just resolved and dropped. I was certain there was going to be a inner conflict for Ash to resolve, but it never surfaced. Actually, there were so many different places that could have had conflict and drama created, but it never did. Everything was neatly resolved. Uh, Bethany and Josie immediately friends? It was all just so easy and perfect. The novel seemed to repeat the same information over and over, almost like she thought the reader could so easily forget why she didn't like ex-boyfriend Micheal of why he had so quickly fallen for her. It seemed like it was trying to prove how screwed up her relationship was and why Ash was so quickly into her. I guess I never really jumped on board to either. It gets more interesting at the end as the men rush in to protect their women from invading dangers from the past, but it resolved itself so quickly and without any problems. It was just okay I guess, my favorite part was the girls night out. Ugh I loved the first books SO much. I was so looking forward to this being exponentially better. I feel lost, like it wasn't even in the same ballbark as the previous two.

Ash seemed like such a cool character, and to be honest I was hoping they'd keep his laid-back personality because I feel like that's such a foil to his business man persona. It would have made him different from the other two...instead all three men were basically the same. Which made me feel like this book was just a different love story with the same man. In other words I got bored. I even started to scan through the love scenes because there was nothing special in them. They were the same as the previous two books. Maybe a different kink, most definitely a different personality would have helped."}, {"userName": "AprilA", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19042636-aprila", "userReview": "[They just met, had really super awesome and fabulous sex, had a small spat, then had a run in with a bad guy and then lived HEA.

I bought the second one at the airport while I was in between connecting flights, and I bought this third one at a used bookstore because I couldn't find anything else that might tickle my fancy at that moment. I'll just say, these books are very generic, not to mention book 2 and book 3 Jace/Ash are exactly the same person, character and trait-wise. They talk the same. They act the same. They treat their women exactly the same. Nobody uses pronouns. Like for example, instead of saying \"I don't want to do this\", Ash and Jace will always say \"Don't want to do this\" instead. But EVERY SINGLE TIME. It gets aggravating. And yes they are into dom/sub, that's soooo original....This is a bad rendition of 50 Shades of Grey and I hated that series too.I think these are supposed to be like romance novels? Because men don't act like this towards women, especially women that are poor and ordinary, and who don't shave their pubes. These extremely rich powerful men just sweep them off their feet after meeting them one time?? And the MEN can't wait to get married?? Are you kidding me?

Of course when I\u2019m talking about Maya Banks, everything is always really good. Ash and Josie together set the page on fire. I loved how Josie spurned the advances Ash kept making towards her. Instead leery because she\u2019s still in a dying relationship when they meet, Josie is determined to not jump from one bad relationship to the next. She ends her relationship with a man who was just playing Dom to her sub but when he attacks her Ash finally steps in and takes the reins\u2026not only with her ex but also with Josie herself. He tries to make her feel needed, loved and encourages her by buying her artwork (behind her back..big mistake\u2026 but his heart was in the right place). I didn\u2019t think Ash made nearly as many mistakes as his friends Gabe and Jace did in their books and instead of righting all his mistakes he was able to evolve his relationship at a better pace than them. Josies artistic mind made her more of a free thinker and she knew from the beginning that the Dom/sub lifestyle was for her and it wasn\u2019t just a game she was playing.Burn is sensual and erotically sexy without being over the top or hardcore. I get tired of some of the BDSM books with all the physical punishment\u2026it\u2019s nice to read one where the men don\u2019t constantly flog, spank or whip the heroine. Instead Banks gives us men who dominate in bed, love completely and emotionally consume the heroine.Ash\u2019s willingness to put everything on the line for Josie was amazing and it made me fall just a bit in love with him myself. I thought Ash would be a bit darker then he actually was based on what was said in the past two books, but instead he was just kinda lonely and tired of the threesomes he used to share with Jace. While he considers Jace and Gabe his family, he still longs for that connection his own real family has never given him. Josie gives him a chance to finally have what he wanted and he was unwilling to let her go once finding her.I was wondering if there would be an actual conclusion to an incident that happened in book one between Mia, Gabe and an investment man and Burn finally gives readers that ending. I wished there would have been more of a threat throughout the books but it does result in a very climactic event and while it was kinda out of nowhere, it made for some good, emotionally wrought reading.Maya Banks is always at the top of my reading pile and Burn only cemented her place. Banks is an exquisite story teller!

Book two, in my opinion, was absolutely ridiculous, the premise anyway. The premise of this one was better at least, but still had the same issues I've continued to have with this series: 1) All the men are billionaires, despite not having the job/career to really, in fact, be one. 2) The whole \"love at first sight thing\" is taken just too far. I get that can happen, sometimes. But, in this series, it happens way too quickly and for seemingly no reason at all. 2.1) And, not only is it \"love\" at first sight, it's this incredible need to possess the woman to the point that she must move in immediately (in the case of this book, even before the first kiss?!?!). 3) With the exception of book one, which wasn't so bad, the female leads have ZERO life...yes, they have personality characteristics, but no friends, no acquaintances other than maybe a troubled family member or boyfriend/lover. So weird. 3.1 And, the friends she meets by way of the men in this book immediately adopt her and they're all BFFs based on little or no reason. I could rant on forever. Let's just say, I think I had a solid 7 eye rolls in before page 56. All that said, I still did read the book. Why, after book two did I even bother with this one? One word. Library. It had it. It was free. And, in all honesty, even though I have mixed feelings about Ms. Banks and her repertoire, the woman does do two things well in all her books...she makes you want to consume the book all in one setting, much like a giant yummy pizza or some other simple-carb laden item that makes you just want to keep eating...and, she can write one heck of a steamy smex scene. This book very much reminded me of a tamed down (smex wise) version of her Sweet series -- very similar formulas with each of the guys being friends and working together, and each book being about them, and all the girls become friends and do silly things together as a side-diversion story, and all-in-all, it's one big happy family. It's all just a bit much for me. Too far flung (even for a romance story). There are many, many other, and better, book options in this genre that I'd recommend to folks first, even from Ms. Banks (still a pretty big fan of all but one of her Highlander books)."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18089945-melissa", "userReview": "If I could give this more stars I would.My kindle was sucked into my face literally.Ash is my new Alpha hot ass crush.....Im hoping for more books that link these characters together.

IDK Read a full review and others here: http://southernbredsouthernread.blogs...I'm just gonna come right out and say it... I was pretty disappointed in this book. I was so excited for the final book in the Breathless Trilogy because it was about Ash, who has only made small appearances in the other two. He was who I was looked forward to seeing in the other two books. They constantly were saying how he was the polar opposite of Gabe and Jace... Turns out they were wrong... So wrong. He was exactly like the other two boys. So much so I felt like I wasn't even reading a different book. In \nRush \nwe got to see Gabe and Mia's interesting and commanding relationship. In \nFever\n we got Jace and Bethany's dark turned sensitive relationship. Both those books were so different from one another. I felt like Banks just took Gabe and Jace and tried to mash them together to give us Ash. It didn't work out. The only thing that was different in this book was the small twist towards the end and the girl. Josie was actually different from the other two women featured in one and two. She was suppose to be like the other two women so I guess it was nice that at least someone ended up different.Burn was also a lot less steam than the other two. The flow of the story was nice and it kept a pretty steady pace, but overall was just lacking the spark that we got from before. Some parts of this book were five star quality while others were more like two. I find myself going back and forth when I was trying to rate this on Goodreads... One second I put it at a four right after I put it as a two.I didn't like the build up between Ash and Josie. The reason I liked the other two guys was because they were all dominant and in control... and owned that. Ash was like that at first but then slowly started slipping...\n  \n    \u00a0\n\nLevering himself upward, he kissed her forehead and then smoothed the hair from her face before kissing her lips. \"Was that good for you?\" he asked. \"If it was any better, I'd be dead,\" she said ruefully.\n\n\nNo! Just no. The Ash I've read up until now doesn't ask how it was for you, because he knows he's good. None of these men ask the women. tisk tisk. Josie was also suppose to be strong willed and when the painting thing is revealed she should have stood her ground longer. I just didn't get them. Sigh. Pretty sure I spent most of my time shaking my head and saying no than I did actually enjoying it.\u00a0\n\n      I love Maya Banks writing, covers, and how she has her books set up. But Burn was not my favorite of hers. She could have given us so much in this book, and there was so much I wanted. She could have came hard with Ash and really made him the wild card she said he was from the get go. The small twist at the end of the book didn't really make up for the lack of everything else. Come on Maya you can't give us these amazing covers, an amazing first and second book, and then hand us this and expect us to just take it.... Ugh... Guess now that I think about it I'm more disappointed than I originally thought.... Hopefully the next series I pick up from her wont have an ending that let me down so much."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7513972-victoria", "userReview": "I pre-ordered this entire series and eagerly waited to read Ash\u2019s story. Poor Ash\u2026He was feeling pretty lonely after losing his partner and crime (and sex) Jace. I was really hoping Ash would find someone special. I really liked how the story begins, with Ash and Josie meeting in the park. He\u2019s true to character and asks Josie about the collar she is wearing. This kind of conversation might be kind of awkward in real life =) but perfectly works and is true to Ash\u2019s arrogant nature in the book. I liked that whole encounter and was excited to read more\u2026Unfortunately, I felt a little disconnected to the rest of the book and I\u2019m having a hard time trying to pin down exactly why. I always have huge expectations for Maya Banks releases because she is one of my favorite authors. Even if I don\u2019t particularly love a story line, I almost always find it really enjoyable. I have struggled a bit with this series, liking book two much more then book one. Maybe my expectations were too high? Maybe it was a character disconnect. I really liked Josie as a character, the free spirited artist, sensual, sensitive. I\u2019m just not sure that I liked her for Ash. Bad boy, anything goes Ash. I just think Josie was a little blah for him. I pictured him with someone a little edgier. In my mind, he needed someone who was going to present more of a challenge. It\u2019s not that I had a problem with the instant attraction Ash and Josie had or how that was presented. I actually enjoyed the chemistry they had early on and there was plenty of steam\u2026Maya Banks fans won\u2019t be disappointed in the bedroom for sure. But for all the steam, I just didn\u2019t feel the sizzle. Kind of a bummer.I hadn\u2019t read that Maya Banks was going to have more books in this series or a spin off book but it seems like she was setting something up with this ending of Burn. Revenge was doled out, a possible who done it? And let\u2019 not forget about Ash\u2019s sister Brittany and the introduction of the mysterious Mr. Wellington. I\u2019d definitely be interested in reading more about that potential relationship. Overall, I enjoyed the book and was glad to meet up past characters. I will definitely continue reading any future books in this series\u2026"}, {"userName": "Jacquelyn Ayres", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22049550-jacquelyn-ayres", "userReview": "I really wanted to give this a four when I got to the end. However, it didn't earn four stars from me until after I read 70% of it. While the sex scenes were hot as usual, the repetition of the characters thoughts were killing me. All I kept thinking was \"Are they ever going to get over this chick's last boyfriend?\" I found myself skimming over paragraphs till I got to something that might be more interesting then what I've already read over and over again. The next thing that bothered me was how ignorant Ash sounded. It's normal to drop a word in the beginning of a sentence (ie. \"I\") but I felt it was overkill and dumbed him down. I even checked \"Fever\" to see if he talked like that in that book. He did. I think it didn't bother me as much because he obviously didn't talk as much in the other books as he did in this one. The only bad thing about the last quarter of the book was that it was the last quarter of the book. I felt like I was finally getting to Josie and Ash. Their story was finally blossoming and then it was done. :( So I was disappointed. *shrugs* I still loved every Character in this trilogy and their relationships with each other.

The men dominate both in the boardroom and in the bedroom. Each novel in the trilogy will explore the relationship of one of the men as he discovers the woman he will love.While Rush talk about Gabe Hamilton And Mia Crestwell (Jace Crestwell little sister), and Fever talk about Jace Crestwell And Bethany, this one however talk tells the story of \"the easy going, fun guy\" Ash McIntyre  and a girl names JosieThe book starts when Ash was standing in front of his building just gazing at the park and thinking about his life... his eyes saw this beautiful, lively, and very vibrant girl drawing in the park. He was intrigued. One problem though... she was wearing a collar!Ash is not what people think of him. Through this series, we as readers are led to believe that he was this fun, easy going, laid back kind of guy... He .was. not. He is the most intense, most demanding, of the 3 guys. He has certain expectations. He never wanted anyone but when he sees this girl, he wants her. Period.My feelings toward the book I love this series, these guys are for sure my type. Love this little family they have going on. Love their connection and how far the would go to protect each other. I was super excited to read about Ash. Out of the three guys, he is-was my favorite. But when i read this book, he was so much different of what i thought he was, he is not bad, he just was... too much? At some point he came out blunt! he was kind of an asshole at some parts!I was so anxious to read his story. I had totally different scenario when i began reading this book. The author should have taken different route when it came to the plot! IT WAS HORRIBLE. Very primal, rudimentary, at some parts you'll feel that she didn't connect or didn't think before she wrote them. Some parts felt unripe even!I liked the style of writing, but the book itself not so much. This is a good writer! but the way she wrote this book, it was horribly disappointing. It felt like something a fresh college graduate would write...I think the only thing i liked about this series altogether is this quote :\u201cPlay hard and live free\""}, {"userName": "Jessica Alcazar", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9551530-jessica-alcazar", "userReview": "I really LOVE the concept of love at first sight but I just didn't get it with Ash and Josie. First, I think everything in the book was rushed. The obsession that Ash had with Josie just didn't quite ring true to me. He's just not that guy. Or at least he wasn't that guy till now. And if he WAS the kind of guy to fall head first, not feet first, then why was he not painted that way before now. I didn't recognize this guy at all. It was like I was reading a book about some other Ash...His sister's HEA was just thrown in there like it didn't matter. Why even put that sideline in if you aren't going to make it what it should be. It should have been HUGE. I know it was a side story, but what she was trying to accomplish in her life was HUGE...I just don't even get why she was even in the book in the first place right now...The Charles Willis thing was MONUMENTAL, yet it was just thrown in there at the end like it was just another day at the park. And what's with painting Ash as some sort of gangster??? That I just didn't get AT ALL. Maybe I should re-read the first 2 books to see if I missed something about Ash that is pivotal in making him who he became in Burn, because I just don't get any of it.The concept of the story and it's sidelines where fantastic, but I couldn't help but feel like the book was just thrown together to meet a deadline.PS....Is it just me, or did anyone else get a deja-vu moment during the girls night out scene when Jace had to call Ash to tell him to come get his woman because they were all on the floor ......Yea, I know I'm not the only one LOL"}], "description": "Ash, Jace, and Gabe: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country.
