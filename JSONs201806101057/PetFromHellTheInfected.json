It was a fun romp through the English countryside. I just had a few irks that I were constant throughout. They books need some tweaking by an editor, there are little errors throughout. Nothing which takes from the story, but they were constant through all 4 books. Also, things just seemed too convenient, maybe I am a cynic, though, lol. Everything went so well, and the protagonist managed to get out of some bad situations very well. Also, too easy for them to get firearms, which I KNOW they are in a govt/military facility, its just that is one of the things I love about British zombie lit, seeing the creative ways the authors come up with for dispatching the z's. Also, not too happy with the way book 4 ended, can't say anymore than that except after everything that everyone said to Marc, he goes and does it anyway!Will stick with this series, I have to know what happens next!"}], "description": "Marc works as a night security guard for Benton's Pharmaceuticals.
