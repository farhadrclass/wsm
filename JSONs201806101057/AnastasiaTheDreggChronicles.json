This is a great start to an amazing story about a teenage girl \"Anastasia\" who has her worst nightmare come to life when she finds her whole family being torn apart by the walking dead. She fights for her life and manages to escape what use to be the comfort of her own home, but not without incident. She was bitten along the way and now the virus is in her too. She is also alone and disoriented with what has just happened. She passes out and wakes to a man carrying her to something... is it safety or has her nightmare just taken a turn for the worse? I don't want to spoil the story for you, so I will say that there is no doubt she has some serious changes coming for her and it is too soon to tell if it will be good or bad"}, {"userName": "Rachel Olson", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9090653-rachel-olson", "userReview": "I'm not one to pay for serials. That still rings true on this...I didn't have to pay for this. That's not saying that it wasn't worth the buy, it's just personal preference not to pay for a serial \"episode\".That being said, I was definitely intrigued by the concept of this story. I'm interested to see the entire story as a whole. I'll be keeping close tabs on this author (not quite stalker style, but close haha), and definitely look forward to reading more of her works.~Rachel A Olson~ParaSuperNormalism"}, {"userName": "Kendall {Book Crazy}", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11385469-kendall-book-crazy", "userReview": "I don't think that this is the sort of book that I would have picked up myself if the author hadn't have come to me and asked me to review it for her! This book was only like five pages so I got through and reviewed it in about 10 to 15 minutes! It's the shortest book that I've ever read! I think that it could easily have been a full length novel! It's a little hard for me to review as it was so short so that is why I gave it 4 stars even though I kind of wanted to give it 5 stars! It was really short though and you just start to get a feel for the story and then it ends! I was getting really into it and then it ended so I was a bit disappointed, but as it was so short then it means that we don't have to wait long for the next book! The plot of the book was quite good! I enjoyed it! I like authors that aren't afraid to have a bit of gore in their books and Anastasia had some gore in it! It also had some action scenes in it as well! I was pretty hooked from the first page as it was sort of like experiencing an adrenaline rush while reading it! I get the feeling of zombies in the book, but we don't get told what they actually are so hopefully we will find out more about what they are in the next book! The plot was easy to follow and it went at a pace to keep me interested, even though it was pretty short! It also had a lot of description in and not a lot of dialogue! The characters were pretty great for only being in five pages! You don't actually learn Anastasia's name in this book so I wouldn't have known it if it wasn't the title of the book and also in the synopsis! I quite enjoyed Anastasia's character! I only got to connect with her for a short time, but I can say that I connected with her! I felt sorry for her as well as she went through a lot in five page! I'm looking forward to seeing where her journey continues in the next book! There were also plenty more characters in this book to add more to the story! I will definitely continue reading this series as Anastasia did surprise me in a good way! I like the cover! I'm not sure if it's the sort of cover that draws me to a book, but I still like it! Big thank you to Dawn for a copy of Anastasia!"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5941201-julie", "userReview": "Ebook: Anastasia (The Dregg Chronicles)Author: Dawn WhiteFiction, Paranormal,This review may contain spoilersI was given this by the author for an honest reviewSummary: Anastasia\u2019s entire family had been killed by something quite un-natural.

Let\u2019s follow the journey to see what happens with Anastasia in The Dregg Chronicles.The ReviewI really enjoyed this story, I cannot wait to start the next one Anastasia\u2019s Surrender, which has just come out, This is a quick read but a really enjoyable one, I don\u2019t read Zombie type books, not usually my thing, but I got really intrigued by this one, the author did a great job of reeling me in, the plot line was well thought out, there was trauma and drama at the beginning, that made you want to keep reading, I love the idea of the carni, dying to know what happens with Anastasia next, I wasn\u2019t sure about having to wait for the next instalment, but I quite like that idea, it builds you up and up, hopefully to a climatic ending, the main character was well thought out, she played her part well, Do yourself a favour and start reading these chronicles, 4.5/5"}, {"userName": "Susanna Mahoney", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5303805-susanna-mahoney", "userReview": "Part I (free on Amazon)The kindle does not upload reviews; I wish I remember what I wrote, as a reader I was blown away with the first part I of the Anastasia- The Dregg Chronicles, it was a sweet treat, delicious to the end. Fast paced and suspenseful, from page one to the conclusion.Anastasia was a sweet young woman until tragedy almost destroys her life. Now the aftermath is a path of light and darkness. What will be her choices, good or bad, it will be a difficult journey to deal with, of the unfair experience she suffers through.I read this and above is the second nighttime snack part II of the series, it is a horror, fairytale and adventure all wrapped in a small package. I was hook from the first book and read the second and of course now craving more."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14100105-christy", "userReview": "I love this author!!This short is a gut wrenching tale full of blood and grossness. As if waking in on your family being torn apart by the creatures of the night isn't bad enough...being bit by your big sister as you are making your dramatic exit (from life as you know it) adds to the grotesque drama. How does life go on...? I loved the story and can't wait for the later installments of this one! If you are questioning it...grab a copy and thank me later.This is a fun story...if the macabre is your thing! Watch out for this author, she is going to be someone special if this is what she produces!!!"}, {"userName": "W.H.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5504334-w-h", "userReview": "Whoa Jack Step Back!! This is a creepy little tale told in the first person. Intriguing beginning.. fast-paced and horrific by nature. I have not read that much horror lately so this was a nice reprieve.

I don't usually do short stories but this one did actually get and kept my attention and can't wait to read more of these stories that is coming every month.I give this author 4 stars only because I don't really like short stories but since this one I did like and enjoy (even though it kept me hanging :) ). So I recommend if you like paranormal stories this is the one for you. Great Job Dawn White.

This short story is a fast read not really affording the reader the opportunity to get to know the characters. No real back story as how it came to be is available either but I assume that this is a prequel and more answers will be forthcoming. One thing I am convinced about is the fact that this series will be twisted.
