These facts may be pertinent to their particular line of enquiry for which they are considered an expert, or they might be random interesting tidbits of knowledge that have been squirrelled away for future research. They might even be just fascinating stories that may have very little to do with anything else. Except of course that everything is connected. Degrees of separation and all that. I had this Russian history professor at the University of Arizona who was decades removed from his best years, and nearing the time when someone was going to start talking to him about all the time he will have to devout to research...once he retires. The hook, in other words, was coming soon. His diseased spine bent him forward. It required some effort for him to raise his head far enough to look someone in the eye. He also listed a bit to the right when he walked, reminding me of Stevenson\u2019s Hyde. He had a full beard, still naturally black despite his age, which made him look very Russian, and therefore, very authentic when discussing Ivan the Terrible or the Cossacks. He would pace back and forth with his hands behind his back gazing at the floor as he lectured. He always wore this black coat. I was once talking to him after class when he fumbled open the black buttons with thick fingers and flapped the jacket open. Hot air escaped as if he\u2019d just opened an Egyptian tomb. Sweat stained his shirt from his armpit to his waist, and the fetid odor of fennel marinated in vodka and stale socks blossomed in the room. He was a terrible rambler, skipping from one point in history to another, and throwing in bits and pieces of history outside of Russia as well. One day a student interrupted him for the second time to ask, yet again, if what he was discussing was going to be on the test. He asked her very kindly to leave the room and to please drop the class. I was slogging my way through the class textbook, so I really didn\u2019t need him to regurgitate what I was already reading. Mostly, I just wanted to stay quiet, and let him talk about whatever he wanted to talk about. Most people expect and want things presented to them in a linear fashion, so I was not surprised to see the class shrink in size as students abandoned ship for the lifeboats with the hope that some other teacher would provide them with more pleasant waters to float in. Now the reason I tell this story is that this book reminded me of that professor. Simon Winchester has written a book that is not easy to categorize. Is it simply a book of random musings, loosely contained to a theme by duct tape and bailing wire? Is it an indulgent travelogue? Is it a 101 geology seminar? Is Kenny G playing saxophone in the background? I\u2019d have to answer yes to these questions...well...not Kenny G. Let\u2019s not be ridiculous. The subtitle of the book is America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906. From perusing quickly through other reviews, there were many readers who were very frustrated with the fact that the book was not focused on the topic they were most interested in reading about... the Great Earthquake of 1906. The title is mildly misleading, but then again I think there was an editor, a publisher, and a writer who were unsure of exactly how to categorize this book and decided to simplify things for marketing purposes. \nThe Eastern edge of the North American Plate reminds me of fortresses from another time.Winchester does discuss the San Francisco disaster, but before that he takes us on a trip to Iceland, to the eastern edge of the North American Plate, which also happens to be the location of some of the world\u2019s oldest parliamentary democracies. The edge forms a dramatic, though stable geography that certainly lends grandeur to any gathering. We cross the U.S. where he discusses the 1886 Charleston quake, the rumblings that happened at New Madrid, Missouri, in 1811-12, and Meers, Oklahoma, where there is a beautiful fault visible from the air. He climbs Mount Diablo and catches a clear enough day to be able to gaze upon San Francisco. \u201dI squinted through a big brass telescope that had been obligingly placed on the parapet. My feeling that this was a confection of untoward and only half-urban-looking delicacy was confirmed by the magnifying lenses. How tightly San Francisco appeared to cling on to its hillsides: One would imagine knuckles whitened, sinews straining, teeth gritted.\u201d\nThe San Andreas Fault, the Western edge of the The North American Plate, much more volatile than the Eastern edge. We slide over to Parkfield, California, which right now is the seismic capital of the world with numerous earthquakes per month that range up and down the richter scale. We go to Alaska to see where the trans-Alaska pipeline crosses the Denali Fault. The pipeline is crooked like the back of my professor and placed on rollers that will hopefully give the pipeline enough give to not rupture if an earthquake does occur. He does spend a decent amount of time talking about the 8.25 earthquake that forever changed the cityscape of San Francisco. He tells individual stories, some of them by famous people, some of them just incredibly unlucky people like Paul Pickney who had the distinction of surviving the 1884 Charleston trembler and the 1906 San Francisco quake. One of my favorite stories involved a four year old Ansel Adams who was thrown to the ground during the quake and cracked his nose. His parents and doctor decided not to fix the nose, and it became the most rugged feature of his famous, classical profile. 28,188 buildings were destroyed. It was stated, to quell fears of future and present residents, that most of the destruction came from fire (error of man) instead of from the earthquake (God\u2019s wrath). They believe over 3000 people perished, but due to a conspiracy of suppression of the actual numbers only 700 were officially claimed. For the city to rebuild they needed more people to come West, and they quite effectively controlled the narrative of the extent of the destruction. \nIt is a rare opportunity indeed to have your picture taken in front of such devastation. Irrefutable evidence that you were there. I thought it was interesting how suicide rates went way down after the earthquake. People suddenly had something more, something larger than themselves, to worry about. If their lives were stressful or pathetic or wretched before the earthquake, suddenly all of that was swept away, along with quite possibly all that they owned in the world. I have often thought that, if everyone had to worry more about day to day living, many of our psychological problems would be reduced in size or even possibly eliminated. I think we have too much time to think about our current state of affairs, many of them beyond our control; and yet, we are swimming in a relative lap of luxury and safety compared to most of human history. It is so difficult to be happy. Maybe we own too much and try to do too much. The San Francisco quake, called the Loma Prieta Earthquake, that occurred in 1989 was not, as everyone hoped, a releasing of pressure along the San Andreas. \u201dIf the assumption about Loma Prieta is correct, then the last time the San Andreas Fault moved in Northern California was not in 1989 but in fact a very long time ago, back in 1906--which means that, with the steady annual movement of its foundations, the two plates are now nearly 200 inches, about 17 feet, out of kilter. This means that an unimaginably enormous amount of kinetic energy is currently stored in the rocks of the Bay Area; one day, and probably very soon, this energy will all be relieved, without warning.\u201dI finished reading this book at about 12:55AM in the morning of November 19th, 2015. I was finally drifting off to sleep after sifting through some of the last pieces of information that Winchester had stuck in my head when I felt or heard a jolt that brought me wide awake. The window in the bathroom rattled. I didn\u2019t for one second think it was a truck rumbling through the neighborhood. I knew it was an earthquake. My daughter texted me from her apartment in Wichita. \u201cDid you feel that?\u201dOh yeah, I felt it alright. I found out the next morning that it was a 4.7 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter just south of us in Cherokee, Oklahoma. To say this book moved me would be an understatement. The timing couldn\u2019t have been better for the universe to talk to me.

It was August 2010, and my wife and I were midway through our Great 2010 Unplanned Battlefield Tour Road Trip Extravaganza. After visiting Shiloh, Vicksburg, San Jacinto and the Alamo, I acquiesced to my wife\u2019s plea that we see the Grand Canyon since a) it was the Grand Canyon and b) it wasn\u2019t a battlefield (frankly, the battlefield-centric part of the road trip was my idea). Anyway, we had 700 miles to go to our overnight destination in Silver City, and precious few radio stations to help us pass the time. (Though I contend that my vivid retelling of the slaughter at Goliad was worth at least an hour to an hour and a half). Thus, my wife put in an audio version of Simon Winchester\u2019s A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906 to bide the time.The first thing we noticed was that Simon narrated this himself, in his rich, Oxford-ian accent, which sounded suspiciously like an average American actor attempting to impersonate a snooty English butler. The second thing we noticed was that his narrative didn't seem to be going anywhere. If Simon wasn\u2019t (putatively) reading from his own book, I would\u2019ve sworn that he\u2019d had a couple glasses of wine and started rambling like Grandpa Simpson.The audio book was so bad it was funny. But after awhile, it was just bad. Accordingly, my wife hit the eject button, and we settled for the tense silence that comes from driving 1,000 miles and visiting four separate battlefields in four days. (The Days Inn in Silver City was a fine cap to that day; before we went to sleep, we played a game called Guess How Many Drifters Were Murdered In This Hotel).I\u2019m stubborn when it comes to books. I don\u2019t like to leave things unfinished. Sometime after we\u2019d returned home, vowing to never speak of my total and absolute meltdown on the Kansas Turnpike (I have to pay to drive across Kansas!? I wouldn\u2019t go to Kansas if they paid me!), I purchased A Crack in the Edge of the World from a used book store. It was the same digressionary, drifting storytelling as before, except this time it was up to my brain to provide the British accent. (And unfortunately, my brain often confuses British and Scottish accents). The book description and the subtitle might lead you to believe it is about the Great San Francisco Earthquake. You wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong. It\u2019s there, sort of, buried in the midst of a steam-of-conscious verbal ejaculation that mimics Kerouac at his most frenzied, except that Winchester is fueled by ego and snobbery rather than mescaline. Mostly, though, this book is about Simon Winchester, and how he is smarter than you, more well traveled than you, and generally better than you in every particular facet of life. A Crack at the Edge of the World begins with Simon conning his publisher to pay him to travel across the world on a geologic journey, visiting places of seismic importance. Never mind that this mainly consists of Simon driving across the United States making condescending remarks about middle-America, he sure seems to be having fun! (Maybe I\u2019m a bit jealous\u2026 I mean, I\u2019d certainly love the chance to get paid to drive around looking down my noses at people and reciting various arcane bits of trivia. Hell, I\u2019d do that for free). Look, I\u2019m not saying Simon isn\u2019t smart. He is. He certainly, most definitely, is intelligent. I know, because he told me. He also has a strong background in geology, so he can articulately expound about all the complex business going on beneath our feet. He goes on and on with erudition and awe about the collisions of tectonic plates and magma and the supercontinent of Pangaea (which will be the foundation for the failed Fox drama I am currently scripting), all of which is illustrated with maps and drawings and a picture of the general store in Meers, Oklahoma, because it\u2019s just so quaint and rustic to his classically trained mind. This is all well and good, except that geology is boring except for the earthquakes so get to the damn earthquake already! Simon gets to the earthquake, rest assured. It just takes 234 pages of meanders, digressions, and entirely useless footnotes about topics completely unrelated to anything remotely touched-upon in this book. The ceaseless introduction of know-it-all non sequiturs might not have been so annoying in a book of more elegance. And to be charitable, there are some nice sequences, including Simon\u2019s description of a night solo-camping on Mount Diablo. The problem, though, is that these detours are interspersed with a lot of seismological jargon that requires slow, careful reading to make any sense. The geology lessons, combined with the anecdotal side-streets, combine to slow the story\u2019s pace to that of the continental drift. This is a short book that feels long, and it feels long for all the wrong reasons. As my frustrations grew, I imagined myself driving a car with Simon Winchester and Jonathan Lipnicki (the little boy from Jerry Maguire) as passengers.JONATHAN: Did you know that the human head weighs eight pounds?SIMON: Did you know that Robert Wallace of the U.S. Geological Survey took a violin with him into the field to serenade coyotes?JONATHAN: Did you know that my next door neighbor has three rabbits?SIMON: Did you know that President Warren G. Harding and King Kalakaua of Hawaii both died in San Francisco\u2019s Palace Hotel and that King Kalakaua\u2019s real name was David Laamea Kamanakapuu Mahinulani Naloiaehuokalani Lumialani Kalakaua? ME: Did you know that I\u2019m driving this car off a cliff right now? Because I am.The section of the earthquake is necessarily disappointing. It\u2019s not bad; not at all. It just underwhelms. This is due to the book\u2019s structure, which does not allow for any narrative momentum. By the time San Francisco gets shook, we have learned all about the San Andreas Fault, Simon\u2019s time as a grad student in Iceland, and the history of the State of California. What we haven\u2019t received is any reason why we should care about the people of San Francisco, who serve mainly as shadowy witnesses to an event that itself becomes a backdrop to the author\u2019s dog-and-pony show. Interestingly, the thing you tend to take away from this account of the earthquake \u2013 and which is echoed in other sources \u2013 is that most of the death and damage came from the resulting fire. This tends to undercut Simon\u2019s compulsive need to talk about and describe seismology. He keeps warning us that a super-earthquake is going to knock California into the sea; yet he never acknowledges that the story he just told is a cautionary tale of building codes and effective fire response. (To be sure, no one ever went broke warning of our impending doom. All Cassandras \u2013 like the original Cassandra \u2013 will eventually be right; tragedy is always right around the corner). Despite what I\u2019ve written, I am predisposed to enjoy a book like this. I am fond of the small literary sub-genre of travelogue-histories, in which a writer goes on a personal journey to visit all the artifacts (and the curators watching over them) that combined to make a historical event. Sarah Vowell (Assassination Vacation, The Wordy Shipmates) is a delightful tour guide, and her books brim with chirpiness and humor. Tony Horowitz (Confederates in the Attic, A Voyage Long and Strange) brings a more sober, journalistic discipline to his work, finding unforgettable modern characters who are almost mystically connected to the past. Simon Winchester is just as talented as Vowell and Horowitz. But he\u2019s also as likeable as the Harvard-Bar-grad-student in Good Will Hunting who smarmily recites the works of Gordon Wood to embarrass Ben Affleck. I would love to take a road trip with Sarah Vowell or Tony Horowitz. I tried to take a road trip with Simon Winchester. We heard his voice on the radio and quickly gave up. If he\u2019d actually been with us, sitting in the middle of the backseat, drinking a Slurpee and extemporizing about every historical marker we zipped past, I would have tossed him from the car. I\u2019m certain that Simon Winchester would survive being thrown from a moving vehicle. He is, after all, the smartest person alive. Also, I\u2019m certain that \u2013 even alone on a deserted highway \u2013 he would\u2019ve found a curious bunny to lecture.And that bunny would listen for awhile, hoping that this odd man with the refined accent would get to a point. Finally, the bunny would give up and bound away. And the night would go on, the stars would come out, and Simon Winchester would still be speaking into the void."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "This is a fascinating but also frustrating book about the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. Simon Winchester has a passion for geology, which makes him a good person to write about this topic. However, his passion is such that he gets carried away on long tangents, and in truth, this book meandered so much that I nearly abandoned it in frustration. The meandering starts early, with a long prologue about Neil Armstrong and how his trip to the moon affected the way scientists think about the earth. There are also long passages on the history of geology and plate tectonics, along with the author's exploratory trips around the world. There is interesting stuff here, but the information could be have been streamlined.After several chapters, we finally focus more on the California earthquake of 1906, which was my favorite part of the book. Winchester describes the causes and effects of the quake, which was followed by a devastating fire that lasted several days and destroyed much of San Francisco. There is also a discussion about how a major earthquake is expected along the San Andreas fault sometime before 2032. (This section was truly alarming, as was the chapter talking about other fault lines expecting a major rupture in the coming decades, including the New Madrid fault line in my current state of Missouri, which could be devastating for a large chunk of the Midwest.) The last section of the book also meanders a bit, with sidenotes about the history of the insurance industry, and how certain businesses tried to downplay the damage of the Frisco earthquake There are interesting details about how the Chinese immigrants were treated both before and after the earthquake, with some city officials trying to drive them out of town. I also appreciated Winchester's description of how San Francisco was viewed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and how the earthquake forever changed the city.Overall I liked this book, which includes good photographs and maps, but it seemed like Winchester tried to combine two subjects into one: the history of geology, and the 1906 disaster. The text of this runs more than 400 pages, and I liked most of it, but it needed more editing and revision. Simon Winchester is a prolific author, and I especially enjoyed his earlier work, The Professor and the Madman, which was about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. I would recommend A Crack in the Edge of the World to readers who like works about natural disasters or geology, but be prepared for a lot of roundabout discussion.Favorite Quotes\"There is a tendency common to most of us to take the more modest of our landscapes for granted. We see a wide and fertile plain, and we drive across it, as fast as its flatness allows, rarely pondering what might have brought it into being. We come across a valley, and, though we might take pleasure in its appearance, we give it all too little thought, other than perhaps to assume there is probably a river somewhere within its folds, And, while we are generally awestruck by the more spectacular mountain ranges, it seems true to say that those hills that are simply hills, or those mountains that are simply mountains, rarely prompt us to ask: Just why are they there? What forces first made them and set them down here, in this particular place?\"\"This fragile, enchanting-looking place had also appeared, more than anything else, most terribly and fatally vulnerable. \"Despite the variety and gaiety and hyperbole, San Francisco in 1906 was also in fact a big, dirty, brawling, vulgar, smoggy, sooty, and corrupt town of rather less charm than myth and latter-day boosterism would have us believe.\"\"Trials of any kind \u2014 war, pestilence, natural or human violence, with wholesale death or total physical destruction, or both, being the harshest of all \u2014 may slow that growth or cause some other setback; but such things are just setbacks, and before long the original reasons for a city's existence reassert themselves. Life returns, buildings and roads are rebuilt, new monuments spring up or old ones are found and dusted off, and before long the city returns to its old self, ready to see what more fate can hurl at it, to challenge and strengthen and temper its will to survive. It may not always entirely regain its predisaster status \u2014 San Francisco had to cede much to Los Angeles, for example, But generally, so far as their respective quiddities are concerned, great cities always recover.\""}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor", "userReview": "I have to say that I really do like this man\u2019s books. I think the only reason I would read a book on Krakatoa is because Winchester wrote it. It is also very likely that the only reason I would read a book on an earthquake is because Winchester wrote it.Let me tell you what there is to love about this book.Firstly, Winchester starts off by talking about the Gaia Theory \u2013 essentially that everything is related to everything else. He does this because talk of earthquakes has only begun to make sense since we learnt of plate tectonics \u2013 that the continents float about the world on huge plates and that these rub up against each other and cause volcanos and earthquakes. And one of the most fascinating things about plate tectonics is that this idea has only been around in science since the 1960s. Think about that for a moment \u2013 that we have only had any real idea about the how and the way of volcanos and earthquakes for a little over forty years.Prior to the 1960s we also had a very localised view of how these catastrophic events happened. We really didn\u2019t have any notion that an earthquake in Tokyo might impact on a volcano in Hawaii. We still have only hints about how these two events might be related, but the fact we can even seriously ask the question now ought to send a shiver down your spine. \u201cWhat a piece of work is Man\u2026 in apprehension how like a God\u2026\u201dGaia theory holds that the whole of the world is linked up by a series of complex and remarkable interconnections. And just to celebrate, Winchester writes his books in a way that brings to the fore layer after layer of beautifully observed relationships between earthquakes and racism and artists leaving for the hills and architecture and religion.When people say things like, \u2018everything is related to everything else\u2019 I generally feel a little uncomfortable in that \u2018let me get out of this conversation as quickly as I can\u2019 kind of way. There is a scene in Douglas Adams\u2019s Dirk Bogart\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency where Dirk is at a complete loss what to do next and so, figuring that everything is connected to everything else, he follows a car at random, which, naturally enough, brings him to where he needs to go. This is fiction after all.Winchester\u2019s paths are never random. His relationships never fail to delight. His keen eye for both the fascinating and the absurd never fail him. I really am very fond of his books and this one is no exception.There is a part of this book where he is describing the horrific fire that started as the earthquake ended. This was a city ready to burn, and the quake bursting both gas pipes and water pipes beneath the city did much to strike that particular match. There is a photo in this book taken from the top of a hill. In the distance you can see the smoke billowing and being blown into the background of the picture. How Winchester explains what you are looking at and what is about to happen in the world of this photograph is one of those moments in a book that is a pure joy. He starts off by stating what we all think \u2013 that fires move in the direction that the winds blow them. Clearly, in this photograph, the wind is blowing towards the back, so that will be the direction the fire will go. He then points out that what is in the distance behind the scene in the photograph is water and already burnt buildings. It is then that he says that city fires not only make their own winds, but that they move in the direction of the fuel that is available \u2013 not always in the direction of the wind.One of the more fascinating connections with this earthquake was the start of the Pentecostal movement. The pastor who started the Pentecostal movement said, a mere three days before the quake and fire, that God was preparing a sign \u2013 and when God prepares signs, he provides the entire Burma Shave experience. The most Godless city in the United States virtually wiped off the map in one go. God does seem to have learnt his lesson though, as this time there are no wives being turned into pillars of salt and the only good man in the town didn\u2019t end up getting drunk and doing a Fritzl with his two daughters. At least, at the time it seemed they only spoke in tongues \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea when Pentecostals started getting down and dirty, but I assume it was a long time prior to when the Swaggarts and Bakers did their stuff.I liked this one very much, but then, I\u2019ve enjoyed every one of his books so far."}, {"userName": "Grumpus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus", "userReview": "This one was tough to rate.

I just have to prove it with a couple of examples, but truly sir: Mr. Winchester, I implore you, where are your trustworthy editors? Nowhere, mon frere. Example One in my hypothetical thesis entitled \"why Simon Winchester is a pain in the ass\": in one paragraph (pgs. 91 and 92, oh, it's a long-ass paragraph) Mr. Winchester makes use of the following words: panjandrum, lickspittle, gimcrack, gasconading. Now, I believe I have already more than proven my thesis, but two further examples for the sake of thoroughness: 2. in a book about the San Francisco quake, the quake happens in real time in the narrative on page 205; before that is background discussion of plate tectonics and other gimcrack subjects. Finally, example three has to be seen to be believed. I think I'll just put a sample paragraph here that shows the tedious, longggggg-winded, pretentious writing style (and mind you, the author seems like a good dude and all, no offense intended, he just needs a competent editor). The following paragraph, I'd hone down to five or six words if I were editing: \"I went to New Madrid, Missouri.\" He uses 175 words:\"To begin to answer that\u2014and geologists have been grappling for years with the vexing problem of those earthquakes that occur where they ought not to\u2014I first had to drive some 600 miles west, to the site of one of the most remarkable earthquakes that America has ever known\u2014by some accounts the biggest ever experienced in the Lower Forty-Eight states.

My second destination was a somewhat obscure and all but forgotten place, though one of some importance in explaining why America suffers earthquakes so far from the edges of the plate on which it stands.

In cooling, the crust was forming itself into rocks that would themselves be permanent\u2014 if only the external forces permitted them to remain at the surface and did not try to drag them or push them down toward the heat again.\tAs they slowly cooled, some of these rocks-to-be separated themselves out, according to perfectly understandable laws of physics: The lighter materials of the scum rose to the surface, the heavier ones passed downward in one enormous fractionating column\u2014a little like the Skaergaard, though over infinitely longer periods of time and under very different physical conditions The lighter materials generally formed themselves into those rocks we now call granites\u2014the course-grained rocks that tend to be prettily light in color as well as in constitution The heavier fractions created layers of rocks like basalt and diorite and gabbro, which were darker and tended to sag downward under the force of gravity forming sloughs, whereas the granites tended to form uplands. The darker and heavier slabs lay sluglike and low on the earth\u2019s surface, and in time they began both to accumulate and to accommodate water that fell from the skies; over many millions of years, this resulted in the creation of oceans. Dark rocks underlay the seas; granites made up the new continents. And this law of basic igneous geology has remained a verifiable truth ever since.\tThe new crust, as it spread and wafted itself around the surface of the sphere, also became cracked, as cooling crusts of clinker and furnace slag are wont to do, and the plates, or rafts, or slabs of floating or sagging clinker that were then formed between the cracks began to swirl about, thanks to the currents of terrifyingly hot material that were(as they still are today) upwelling and sinking back underneath. No doubt the slaggy scum came under the influence of other forces. There was gravity, there were great gyrations in the planet\u2019s magnetism, there was its spinning motion, the occasionally too-close-for comfort proximity of the moon and other planets, and the tilting and wobbling of the earth\u2019s own axis of rotation. The third planet from sun, it must be remembered, is in geological terms a comparatively small ball of material, subject to all manner of kinetic and thermal influences; and the first continent-in-the making was turned this and that for millions of years, as it struggled gamely to get a grip on itself and remain more or less in place on the ever-changing molten mantle that underlay it.\n(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Schmacko", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko", "userReview": "Boy howdy, Simon Winchester sure knows his geology!

I can highly recommend it.Much to the delight of info gluttons, Winchester as always ranges widely from the nominal focus of the book. Any reader looking for an in-depth history of the whys and wherefores of the earthquake and fire will be more than satisfied, as well anyone wondering about the broader surrounding topics.Of course, if you want your author to go straight to the heart of the matter, this isn't your book and, furthermore, you really should forego any of Winchester's books.By the way, this book was more personal to me than to most of you out there: I've lived in San Francisco for almost my entire adult life, and I'm a third-generation Californian (and almost a third-generation San Franciscan). I've backpacked for many years in the Sierras, thrown up millions of years ago by the mechanisms he describes in the book, and I felt connected to every scene he describes in the city.Still, my reaction to this book isn't unalloyed praise. I think there were several false notes. The more obvious one was the connection to Pentecostalism. I agree it was an important phenomena of the time \u2014 actually, I wouldn't be here if my mother's parents hadn't found each other while attending a Pentecostal church during the depression. But the movement almost certainly would have taken off with or without San Francisco's earthquake; that kind of exuberant religiosity seems to be a fundamental part of U.S. culture. Despite the specific anecdotes that tie the two stories together, I felt it was really a post hoc, ergo propter hoc kind of connection, and detrimental to the book's focus.The other significant annoyance was that several times the author referred to San Francisco and other places in close proximity to the fault as \"very dangerous\". Now, maybe when the Big One hits I'll change my tune, but substantially fewer than 1000 Californians have died in earthquakes in the past century. As I'm writing this at the end of April 2013, and the New York Times just reminded me that three years after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (which killed 63 in the region), Los Angeles lived through the Rodney King riots, which killed 54. And, of course, at least 15 (and possibly many more) have just died in the explosion of a fertilizer company in Texas. Frankly, life is dangerous; everyone dies in the end. Living in an earthquake zone does slightly raise the likelihood of dying prematurely (or being seriously injured), but there are many, many other factors that affect mortality rates even more. Coastal California \u2014 right along the San Andeas Fault \u2014\u00a0has a famously benign climate, for example. I suspect the overall health of the locals is higher because of it, and probably lengthens their life expectancy more than the earthquake risk shortens it. Winchester even makes fun of the residents of Portola Valley, a town that lies directly upon the fault line \u2014 amused at how they argue endlessly about whether and where to move this building or that, only to go back to sipping their sauvignon blanc. He agrees that their \"way of life [is] quite unrivaled in its quality anywhere in the world\", yet still thinks that there can be \"no greater monument to hubris\" that the choose to live there.I suppose he really thinks they'd be better off somewhere else, but I think there's a lot of hubris in his assertion that he is right and several million residents of the San Francisco Bay Area are being irrational. Perhaps he should have asked the scientists at the Menlo Park's USGS \u2014 the same folks he thanks for helping in his studies. After all, their office is on alluvial soil about eight miles from Portola Valley, and they undoubtedly live in the area. It apparently did not occur to Winchester to ask them what they feel about that risk.I'll take the certitude of a quake and its consequent increase in my mortality over living elsewhere, thank you.Addendum: Stephen Colbert's bit on the earthquake is amusing: The San Francisco Earthquake: Was It Really That Bad?.\u00ad"}, {"userName": "James Peavler", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/651974-james-peavler", "userReview": "This book only gets a three from me because I felt it was falsely advertised. As a Bay Area native, earthquakes have always held a strong fascination for me. I experienced a fairly large one in 1989, and my memories are still as strong today as they were then. So when I pick up a book that gives me an impression that its about the year 1906, and the seismic activity that occurred all around the world that year, ending with the ultimate seismic event near the shores of San Francisco, it was disconcerting to read about the geologic history of the earth.As fascinating as that was, when over half the book is about the formation of the earth and the world as we now know it, and the Great Earthquake of 1906 seems to be almost an afterthought for the final 100 or so pages . . . well, needless to say, I was a bit disappointed. It's a time in California history that I find enthralling, and was nestled in my bed ready to read about how the ground rolled and the buildings fell and fires consumed, yet I had to dredge through why Iceland is where it is and why dirt in Japan is related to dirt in Africa. Believe me, it was interesting, but when you pick up a book expecting one thing and read another, it's a disappointing experience.

You book the flight, make time to head out to the West Coast, and make your way to JFK. Only when you arrive, you find that your flight had been cancelled.

You\u2019ve seen the in-flight movie. You\u2019ve finished your novel well before you reach your intermediate destination. And then there\u2019s a long layover, and you get back on another plane, with the same in-flight magazine and discarded USA TODAY sections and nothing else to read. And somewhere, over Kansas, you speculate that you are still a long, long way from San Francisco.Readers of A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906, can relate, and more than you know. Author Simon Winchester is (metaphorically speaking) headed for San Francisco, but it takes a damnably long time to get there, and there are more detours along that route than even the most unfortunate airline reader will ever encounter, much less countenance.To give you an idea \u2013 just an idea \u2013 of where A Crack in the Edge of the World is going, the book starts in Wapakoneta. Ohio, known primarily as the home of Neil Armstrong, who has nothing to do at all with the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 that anyone, even the multitalented Winchester, can reveal. This is in the prologue, which introduces the Gaia Hypothesis and the New Geology and the rest of the science stuff. After that, Winchester gets near San Francisco \u2013 interjecting himself into the narrative by means of a story about his a camping trip to a nearby mountain \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t take him long to get back to plate tectonics all over again.About every other chapter in Winchester\u2019s book is noted as a \u201cChronicle\u201d, and these chapters hew to what a reasonable expectation of what a primarily historical book about the San Francisco earthquake would be about. These are the short chapters. The long chapters are long indeed. One of them, \u201cFrom Plate to Shining Plate\u201d, is a first-person disquisition of a lengthy, and largely pointless, tour of the North American Plate. Highlights of this include a trip to Iceland (where the North American Plate begins), New Madrid, Missouri (where a devastating earthquake took place in 1811), and the Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma (where another fault is to be found). None of this, except by comparison, has anything to do with San Francisco, or 1906, or anything much of anything else.And the travelogues (there\u2019s another one in the vicinity of the San Andreas Fault, and yet another up to Alaska at the book\u2019s close) are at least marginally interesting. The scientific disquisition of the geology that underlines San Francisco is explained with a degree of depth that is only surpassed by its complete lack of clarity. (Anyone who has read, and enjoyed, John McPhee\u2019s Annals of the Former World will recognize the shortcomings in Winchester\u2019s book.) Winchester covers ophiolites, and strike-slip faulting, and epicenters, all before telling us anything in-depth about San Francisco and 1906 and the human scope of the disaster.Eventually, Winchester does get his reader to San Francisco. The earthquake, when it happens \u2013 that\u2019s on page 243 of my version \u2013 is arresting, and powerful, and has a human impact. Winchester introduces us to the famous figures in San Francisco \u2013 Enrico Caruso, and Jack London, and the young Ansel Adams \u2013 and the ordinary people displaced by the tragedy. He focuses, admirably, on the fate of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, and the fight made by nativist Californians to relocate its residents elsewhere. Winchester handles the historical sections with a grace and aplomb that\u2019s totally missing from the first half of the narrative \u2013 in part by the simple action of taking himself out of the story, but mostly to his skill as a storyteller.A Crack in the Edge of the World is a perfectly reasonable choice for any seasoned airline traveler to bring along \u2013 not least because the reader has the power to skip over the more impenetrable sections. Unfortunately, there\u2019s still no easy and simple way to skip over long layovers at O\u2019Hare."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13954899-kathleen", "userReview": "This book is a bit slow and meandering, with more geological factoids than I needed to know, but still I enjoyed it.I lived in sparkling San Francisco for a summer, on beautiful Beach Street, which took a hit during the Loma Prieta quake of 1989. But that recent quake was nothing compared to the 1906 disaster Winchester portrays here. He bases his account on first-hand journal entries, letters, diaries, newspaper articles by James Hopper, and the bleak photographs that made Genthe famous. Winchester portrays the quake from a worldwide Pangea perspective, comparing fault lines and famous quakes, including Yellowstone National Park. He also portrays the after effects, including 26 aftershocks, water pipes bursting, cattle stampeding, and fire swallowing city blocks whole, while the mayor scrambled for water in a city surrounded by sea.I also recommend the docudrama movie THE GREAT SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE, directed and written by Philip Smith. Unlike Winchester, Smith portrayed Mayor Eugene Schmitz as a villain. We see him as an avaricious, corrupt politician \u2014 and a fool who refused to allocate resources to prevent fire, ignoring his fire chief's warnings, despite the fact that the city had burned six times since the 1849 Gold Rush. Smith condemns the mayor for handing the city over to martial law, allowing soldiers to execute about 500 citizens, including some who were innocent of wrongdoing.

For starters, the cover is a fucking lie--as is the flyleaf--all 6 paragraphs about the SF Earthquake with but one clue I see now for what was in store for me: \"But Winchester's achievement is even greater: he positions the quake's significance along the earth's geological timeline and shows the effect it had on the rest of twentieth-century California and American history.\"--because yeah, he sure as hell tries to do that. For starters this book is NOT about the SF Earthquake, and if you pick it up thinking you are going to read a history delving into that day and the repercussions etc., you will be disappointed. If you wanted to read the pretentious musings of a self-indulgent Brit as he compulsively visits everything remotely connected to earthquakes in the Western hemisphere starting back to when the earth was just a little baby ball of molten lava, then you are in for a treat. You know, I've read a lot of non-fiction history books where the author plays a main role--everything by Sarah Vowell, and Betty Furness's Mabel is one of my all-time favorite books--and perhaps those two ladies had better editors or friends to tell them \"NO! YOU'VE EXPOUNDED ON PANGAEA LONG ENOUGH\" -- so it's not like I hate those kinds of books and have tons on my shelves, but dear god I hated this one. I wanted the author to fall into some crevice a 100 pages in. He never even gets to the topic of SF earthquake until like 250 pages in a 385 page book. I don't feel like I left this book knowing anything more really than when I started--other than the exact second it occurred, because there are multiple chapters about that, and just a few paragraphs it seems spared for the death count, which just seems to be \"dunno, no way to tell, 300 - 3,000.\" If he wanted to write a book about tectonic plates and geology, he should write a book on that. But after hearing so much self-praise and hints to his delightful life of adventure and knowledge, it's also coupled with him conducting his \"research\" right after 9/11. I say research because it seems like it's mostly snotty observations on the towns he visits in the US--Americans are generally fat, slothish, freedom fry eating head-in-sand morons. Pithy passages like: \"There is worse, however: Someone suggested taking the road farther north still to Dawson City and being initiated into a drinking club that has its signature libation a whiskey in which is marinated some unfortunate frostbitten toe.

Tennessee described as \"tedious\" and \"too wide\"? And I didn't bother to go through and mark previous passages to compare, but it seems like his descriptions of SF varied widely. Is it a beautiful city after all, unlike any other, or sorta ruined with meh houses with no plan and is only beautiful because a luck of nature? It seems he espouses to both views. Though...I do take it back, I did like finding out that the namesake of the Douglas fir, David Douglas, tripped and fell into a hole that had an angry bull (who had also previously fallen in hole) at the bottom, who gored him to death, but it wasn't worth reading all those pages to learn that fun fact."}, {"userName": "Marika Alexander", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9889724-marika-alexander", "userReview": "I have to first start out by saying I'm not a science-y person by any means, so a lot of his book went over my head, even though it's written for a layman. On the positive side, it is chock full of information about earthquakes: what causes them, why and when they happen, what each of the waves feels like, and some of the worst historical earthquakes and the damage they wreaked on human beings, structures and geography. It's also full of very interesting details about the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and the aftermath. In short, this book has A LOT of information! Mr. Winchester certainly knows what he's talking about. He makes a very interesting, and I'm sure entirely correct, assertion that the Earth is a finely balanced living organism, and a disturbance on one side of the world can cause a disturbance on the other side. Just 12 days before the great quake in San Francisco, Vesuvius erupted in Italy. 1906 was also the worst year seismically speaking, of the 20th century. 2004 is (so far) the worst year of the 21st century. I had two difficulties with this book which prevents me from giving a higher rating- first of all, much of it is very dry and dare I say, boring- granted, I'm no science aficiando so a lot of it is due to being new information for me. But it was also distracting that almost every page had a little footnote, which may or may not pertain much to the paragraph it's annotating. I found them to be very distracting, and I started to get the sense that the author simply knows too much, but doesn't know how to cut it down to a manageable level. Sometimes I found the footnotes to be interesting and other times they were simply confusing why they were included in the first place. I think this is more a criticism of the editing than the writing. My other reason for the lower star is I didn't realize how scared I would feel after reading this book!

While I did fill it with sticky notes and found the read overall quite rewarding, I was also left with a strong sense that it could have been a much better book.Winchester is a very knowledgeable fellow. The book is framed around his own travels to places like Iceland and then across North America, from Charleston, to New Madrid, and on westward to San Francisco. His goal is to explore tectonic theory and how the San Andreas Fault fits into the larger scheme of the living world. The data is quite interesting, but at the same time he rambles. It's like he came across too much good information and tried to squeeze it into one book. This creates a problem when a book about the 1906 earthquake doesn't get to the actual earthquake until page 241.This also creates the odd dilemma in that it felt like little of the book was on the actual quake. Information on the aftermath is interesting, such as the struggle to get insurance companies to pay up (especially German-based ones), and the plight of the Chinese and the ensuing wave of \"Paper People\" who tried to take advantage of or were genuinely lost because of the loss of immigration paperwork. He then, however, devotes too much space to how the \"wrath of God\" aspect of the earthquake inspired the Pentecostal church movement. Even his trip to Alaska to discuss the fascinating matter of how the pipeline has been created to withstand earthquakes is colored by derogatory comments on towns along the way, including a slam against Wal-mart that felt out of place in its arrogance.In all, its an interesting book that's diluted by too many tangents.

I'd read Winchester's Atlantic a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. However, the jacket copy is a bit misleading here. True, the book is about the 1906 earthquake, but I was expecting a good three hundred pages on the event and the aftermath, peopled with unforgettable characters. I was expecting something akin to Devil in the White City; instead, Winchester spent about 200 pages setting up the geology of the event. Yes, it was very informative, and I did enjoy it, but I would've enjoyed it had I been expecting it. The event itself takes up about 100 pages, most at the end, but with a teaser at the beginning as well. I learned some fun facts, and in the end I now feel like I have a good foundation on what happened on that fateful April day just over a century ago.

It just wasn't what I was expecting, and I still don't feel like I have a good grip of the San Francisco disaster--unlike the masterful Isaac's Storm--where there's plenty of science, but also plenty of history."}, {"userName": "Bookmarks Magazine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine", "userReview": "Winchester's latest work is a lesson in unfulfilled expectations. Though he presents the book as a history of the San Francisco quake, over the first 200 pages Winchester offers an abbreviated version of John McPhee's Annals of the Former World. Where McPhee made clear his intentions to write a comprehensive geological history of the North American continent, critics feel duped by Winchester, or by the publisher's marketing department. Many reviewers are dismayed to see him reusing information from Krakatoa (**** July/Aug 2003). Even more wish he'd return to the human elements that made The Professor and the Madman such a critical and commercial success. Here, exhaustive research begets a fault-filled book, with little human or thematic tension to bind it together.This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13181751-michael", "userReview": "Ok.... this book is NOT about the San Francisco earthquake. Well... at least the first half isn't. That's as far as I made it. I put this book down 4 times to read others, so I gave it a go. The first half of this book is plate tectonics lesson along with a journal of the authors travels to plate tectonics related areas in western North America. NOT about the earthquake! This man is obviously very intelligent and should be a science professor if he isn't already. I bought this book to learn about the San Francisco earthquake.. i read 250 (of the 500 pages) and didn't learn a single thing about the quake. I had enough. It's a drawn out science lesson that I would imagine eventually discusses the event in the title. I was thoroughly disappointed and plan to try another book on the subject... that actually talks about THE EARTHQUAKE!"}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris", "userReview": "Sprawling. Long-winded. Full of rabbit trails, non-sequiturs, detours, ramblings, and tangents.Winchester talks about geology, the California gold rush, history in Iceland, insurance companies, immigration, even other earthquakes. Only more than half way through the book does he finally get around to talking about the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.His writing isn't engaging enough for me to happily wait for him to get around to the main point. As a result, I started tuning out sometimes, not caring about what I missed, and waiting for it to be over. His sentences are also far too long, so it made this audio book feel even longer than it was.I've no idea why Winchester would think this to be good nonfiction writing. He talks just to hear himself talk."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/625444-diane", "userReview": "Simon Winchester is such a pain. He selects wonderful topics to write about and as long as he keeps himself out of the book, it can be wonderful. This one is pretty bad. I almost quit listening (he reads the book which isn't good)but am glad I endured the first three chapters or so because the information on the earthquake itself and its aftermath is pretty interesting. There were at least three things I would like to learn more about: the cattle stampede during the earthquake, Angel Island, and Arnold Genthe's the photographs taken during/after the earthquake and of Chinatown before the earthquake. The book ends as it begins with long, self-absorbed ramblings by Winchester."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35136-sarah", "userReview": "I LOVE Simon Winchester. The guy's voice is like audiobook crack: he's British and he's perfect. If you want to read his other works, definitely listen to them. Start with Krakatoa; it blew my mind.This book is almost as good as Krakatoa. I learned a lot and couldn't believe how my public school education failed to educate me on history. I did get a little bored on the 9th CD, but the 10th picked up when he recounted his trip to Alaska and then back to Yellowstone. Certainly a must-read... or better yet a \"must-listen-to.\""}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4380068-bill", "userReview": "Like most of Simon Winchester's novels, I enjoyed this one. The focus is the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906. The earthquake, while the focus, is more an opportunity for Winchester to discuss fault lines, new geology, some history, sociology, etc. I like his meandering pace and always find the information he provides on his subject, accessible and interesting.
