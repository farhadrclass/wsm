I had to get on Youtube and watch/listen to some gamelan music as I read this. Very interesting, and I'm glad to have had this book as an introduction to Balinese music and dance. I listen to the gamelan music (which, I admit, first strikes my ears as discordant and strange), and I think of a line from the book, \"The payoff for introducing students to sounds they've never heard before comes not so much when they point at the instrument you're showing them and say 'What is that thing,' but when they reach up to their ears and say, 'What are these things?'\" One thing I appreciate about the book is the way it uses music to describe life. I am not a person who is educated or skilled as to understanding music theory or creating music myself; I can barely pick out a simple tune on the piano, and my clarinet was deserving of pity during my band years while I mangled the sounds it was supposed be making, but I love to listen to music as much as the next guy, and I feel like this book deepened my understanding of music. The book provided me with some education about Balinese culture as well, which was nice, but what I love about the book is what it says about the things we have in common in the midst of our beautiful diversities. The book is full of wonderful observations about society and religion and the offerings people make. It got me looking at myself and my beliefs, as it provided a glimpse into an unfamiliar culture and religion that is so very different but as human as mine and full of so much common ground. Being Mormon (as is the author) perhaps caused the book to hold a greater resonance for me, but I do not think I would have to share the author's faith for this book to speak to me. Also, I now have a hankering for an avocado shake."}, {"userName": "Mike Moore", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644896-mike-moore", "userReview": "This is a lovely little book. It's a travelogue of sorts, though the journey to a foreign country (Bali, of course) is only roughly sketched and half or more of the book takes place on the author's native soil. Still, the book has a quality that I associate with the best of travelogues: finding familiarity in the foreign and ultimately reflecting on the wonder of the commonplace.Balinese music is fertile ground for such ruminations. There may be nothing that could be quite so exotic and downright strange (to a westerner) as this music that is ubiquitous in its homeland. This book does not attempt to impart expertise on what is obviously a complicated subject, but it does convey a sense of the (sometimes disorienting) principles behind gamelan music. It also gives an account of the mystical and traditional underpinnings of the musical form that manages to be charming without becoming saccharine.While the presentation of the culture of Bali is fairly well executed, the best parts of the book come from the author actively and consciously creating a synthesis of that culture with his own. This book will therefore be of interest primarily to those who are familiar with the Mormon culture. However, there is a depth to the accommodation of east with west that reverberates beyond that limited sphere. There are echoes of Pascal's Penses when the BYU physics department gets involved in the analysis of the instruments brought to form a local gamelan, and the difficulties of reconciling bureaucratic bookkeeping with courtesy and friendship are universal. This may be a book written for a very narrow audience, but I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who seeks the beautiful and awful within the mundane."}, {"userName": "Tami", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1472968-tami", "userReview": "This book was great. I would never have picked it up if it weren't for the fact that I have known Jeremy for as long as I can remember. I can tell you there is no fraction small enough to compare my knowledge of music to his, and I felt the book would be too technical for me to follow. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved how the book showed that music was related to everything in life. There was a passage that I wished I could type word for word right now, but I don\u2019t have the book handy. In an effort to paraphrase, which I will probably do badly, it said something along the lines of when the music dies so does life. The comparison of Hinduism and Mormonism as strange as it sounds worked well. The culture of the Balinese was wonderfully described. The one downfall was the lack of more photos. I imagined things throughout the text, but wanted proof that what I was envisioning was what was being described. \uf04a That is the OCD in me. I would recommend this book (and already have) to anyone that studies music, who would enjoy reading of the culture of Bali, and/or who studies religion."}, {"userName": "Tami", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3660626-tami", "userReview": "I received this book via GoodReads. I requested it because I love music and am constantly amazed by the power of music to unite and evoke, yet I had absolutely no knowledge of Balinese music or Bali in general and figured it would be something to learn about. Not only did I learn a lot about both in this tiny little book, but I also learned a lot about culture, intercultural relations..and myself! The beauty of this book, I think, is that it doesn't preach but provides a space for you to reflect. It's also such a beautifully written book, some of the turns of phrase are just magical."}, {"userName": "Tobinsfavorite", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2265679-tobinsfavorite", "userReview": "I wavered between 4 and 5 stars for this one, but in the end went with 5 because there's no other book like it, at least that I know of.There are many beautiful passages in this book. (Wow. That has two distinct and appropriate meanings. I must be very clever.) Sometimes, the author would focus on a part of his journey I was less interested in, and I would become less interested in the book, but then another of these insights would pop up, making worthwhile the less interesting (but necessary) information I had just absorbed. I learned a lot from this book, and I also enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2299324-kate", "userReview": "This a beautifully written account of a professor of musicology bringing the music and a piece of the culture of Bali to BYU. The book chronicles Grimshaw's journey to Bali and his subsequent initiation of a Gamelan group at BYU. Grimshaw does a great job breaking down the complex components of the music into understandable bits while providing a glimpse at Bali culture. This short book is worth reading especially if you have an interest in music or Indonesian culture."}, {"userName": "Eileen", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1035123-eileen", "userReview": "Won this book on FirstReads. Although I've never taken music lesson, I did enjoy this book about Balinese music and culture. Some of the music info was over my head, but it was very interesting, none-the-less. I really enjoyed the section about the king's cremation. It was so over the top. Literally!The students and faculty of BYU have greatly benefited from Jeremy Grimshaw's love of world music and culture. Way to go, Jeremy!"}, {"userName": "Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5720167-morgan", "userReview": "I love this book for its remarkable insights into much more than just Balinese music. If there is one metaphor that best sums up my conceptualization of life, the universe, and everything, it is that everything is a wave, a pattern, an oscillation, a rhythm, an harmonic. This book provides so much fodder for my way of thinking about things and opens up further perspectives still. I love it for that, and for Grimshaw's truly moving descriptions of the funeral of a king."}, {"userName": "Wm", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216811-wm", "userReview": "Beautifully written and a study in how to write cross-cultural creative nonfiction and, even better, how to write about the experience of learning, playing and studying music.
