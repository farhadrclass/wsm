Set in ancient Egypt, it's the story of Mara, a bright, feisty slave girl who unexpectedly finds herself forced to act as a spy for both sides of a conflict over the throne of Egypt. Either side is likely to immediately kill her if her duplicity is discovered. And then her heart starts to get involved ... I had very fond memories of reading Mara years ago, and I was delighted and, frankly, relieved when my re-read lived up to my memories, which isn't always the case when I re-read favorite books from my teenage years. (*coughrobertheinleincough*) It's not a perfect book, but I'm upping my rating to five stars, dang it, just because I can, and because I so enjoyed Mara and her duel of wits with Sheftu. Sheftu is my favorite kind of book hero, an intelligent, extremely capable man hiding behind the mask of a charming, lazy courtier in order to achieve a greater goal. (I'm such a sucker for that Scarlet Pimpernel kind of trope.)Tomorrow, by Amon, she would have revenge. She would treat him with a smiling indifference he wouldn't be able to break through no matter how hard he tried. She would be gay--aye, charming--but oh, how remote! . . .Mara found Sheftu's manner the next morning just as gay, just as impersonal, and so much more convincing than her own that she was out of sorts before an hour had passed. There was no outdoing him at irony, that was clear. She would have to find some other means of punishing him.But this is more than a simple adventure and love story; the book has some surprisingly profound ideas about living for a greater cause, the power of love for your country, and how a country is made up of people, the poor and humble as well as the rich and powerful \u2015 all of whom are important.This one's a keeper and a total comfort read."}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "\"Then the stars went out, for the bark of Ra, in fiery splendor, burst out of the East. Sunshine flooded the wide desert and the long, green valley of the Nile. The night was over; a new day has dawned for the land of Egypt.\"\nGenerally, I do not reread books. I have a short attention span, I constantly seek novelty, and once a book or a film has been watched, even if I greatly enjoyed it, I will never reach for it again. There are only a few books that I enjoy rereading, Mara, Daughter of the Nile has been one I have reached for repeatedly since I first read it and fell in love with it as a 12-year old girl. A few years ago, I donated a enormous amount of books after reluctantly admitting to myself that I will never touch them again after the initial reading: this book still occupies a place on my currently tiny and trimmed-down collection of paperbacks, and it's going nowhere.Call it nostalgia, if you will, but this is such a lovely little book, and it has occupied a dear space in my heart ever since. This is a solidly middle-grade novel, but I find that a great middle-grade novel is a wonderful thing. They are so essential to hook in a young reader and instill in them a love of reading that lasts a lifetime. These books have themes, they have believable, loveable, flawed characters. There's no psychoanalysis required of the characters, but they send such an important message to a young reader: you can be better than you think, you can be a good person, you can aim for higher than what you believe yourself capable. A small person can make a difference.The story is simple, the plot is straightforward. There is no overwhelming theme here of existence, no aspirations to grandeur, yet I love it just the same. I do confess to being a great fan of Ancient Egypt. The mythology, the people, the history; while I have read many books within this setting, telling stories of such exalted characters as Cleopatra, Nefertiti, King Tutankhamen, this wee book remains my favorite in the sadly rare genre of Egyptian fiction.Mara is a slave, she was not always one, but that has been her life for as long as she can remember. She is a foreign-born slave, captured with her late mother; Mara has blue eyes, which is reviled and feared by her master, and is different from most slaves in that she has been previously educated in reading and writing. She also has a more valuable commodity: the ability to speak Babylonian. It is for this purpose that Queen Hatshepsut's man initially buys her; she is to spy upon Prince Thutmose through his future bride. Mara is to play the interpreter for Princess the Canaanite princess, Inanni.Through a twist of fate, Mara ends up playing the unwilling double agent, with none the wiser. She ends up being a pawn for Lord Sheftu, who is working secretly in support of placing Prince Thutmose on the throne in place of his devious, destructive pharaoh sister, Queen Hatshepsut.Mara has no choice. She cannot reveal her role to either. To do so would be to risk death, truly, for the life of a slave is worth absolutely nothing to such powerful and wealthy men. Eventually, though, Mara has to choose a side, and one of her masters will prove himself to be a truly idealistic man, who is working towards a better future for Egypt. To get to her happy ending, Mara must rely on her own wits throughout the intrigue, throughout the danger. She has to overcome her own prejudices, and decide whether luxury and freedom is preferable to doing what she knows is right...despite the fact that it could cost her everything, including her life.I loved Mara's determination. Yes, she is selfish initially, but this is a girl who has been a slave, mistreated, ill-fed, feared for her freakish colored eyes, of all things. She has endured hardship, beating, and so when she is given a chance at freedom, she takes it. And boy does she love what that little taste of freedom has to bring. \n\"[The clothes] were not too lavish...but to her it was unimaginable luxury. And as she shook the garments out one by one and looked at them, she felt again the fierce determination that nothing, nobody must stand in the way of her possessing such things always, freedom and gold and a life worth living---gardens with lotus blooming in the fishpool...rows and rows of papyrus scrolls on the shelves in a beautiful room.So she dreamed.\"\nMara is not perfect; despite being a slave, she feels herself to be a true Egyptian, and looks down upon the foreign princess Inanni. Mara is patronizing towards Inanni's full figure, which is admired by her people, but reviled by the Egyptians, who prefer a slim silhouette. Inanni's strange clothes, her customs, her fear towards anything Egyptian is viewed condescendingly by the haughty Mara. Eventually, Mara grows to realize her own faults, and realizes that she has been underestimating her princess' strengths. There is some romance in here, nothing too steamy, nothing inappropriate at all for the middle-grade audience. It grows step by step, there is no insta-love, as enemies grow to be friends, and then perhaps something more.I absolutely loved the bits of Egyptian culture in this book. The descriptions of food, of customs, of cosmetics and clothing, of daily minutiae. I don't find that the adult novels of this nature does so well in the descriptions of little details as this one did. The writing is beautiful, the speech pattern is strange, in some way, but does not feel out of place in this setting; I actually really loved the formal, slightly archaic quality of the speech in this book. The descriptions are beautifully described, in the way that Eloise McGraw does so well in all her children's books.Highly recommended for anyone, of any age."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31502-kate", "userReview": "I am going to open up my heart to you guys. I read this book when I was, oh, maybe 7 or 8, and it was my favorite book for YEARS. I re-read it countless times. It was the only book from my childhood I brought with me to college. It may have been, in large part, the reason my mom once bought me a t-shirt that said \"Kathleen\" in - wait for it -HIEROGLYPHICS.I have no idea if this is actually a good book or not.

It\u2019s the way the characters talk and interact with each other. The hero doesn\u2019t just kiss the heroine. He pulls her into his arms and gives her a grand sweeping kiss that should have music playing in the background. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I happen to love this because I think it\u2019s breathlessly romantic. It\u2019s like they put every bit of sexual tension and wrapped it up in that one kiss. I can\u2019t help but think though that it\u2019s a characteristic of that time period, which sort of dates it. And like an old movie, the book moved a little bit slower. The middle dragged. This is why I knocked a star. I think the writing is lovely though.I liked the characters, especially Mara and Inanni and their friendship.I have to commend Eloise Jarvis McGraw for her excellent research and the descriptive way she brings ancient Egypt to life. McGraw adds all these lovely details, which made me think of old Egyptian art and artifacts. Although I\u2019m much more of a Hatshepsut fangirl than McGraw is. In fact, I felt a little like Mara was helping the wrong side, because let\u2019s face it, Hatshepsut was awesome. Sheftu argues that the Queen spends too much money on buildings, but what does he want to do, build up the army so they can go raid the borders. Whatever, Sheftu. Let\u2019s face it, guys, you\u2019re just annoyed that the Pharaoh is a woman, a very successful woman. But anyway, I did enjoy this and highly recommend it to ancient Egypt fans."}, {"userName": "Gail Carriger", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2277045-gail-carriger", "userReview": "I adored this book when I first read it at age 10, and still love it 20 years later. I cannot recommend it highly enough to young lady readers who have any interest at all in Ancient Egypt. Mara is a slave girl sold to become a spy who ends up embroiled in a plot to overthrow the (female) Pharaoh Hatshepsut. McGraw's attention to detail and knowledge of the time are impeccable, her characters are alive and engaging, there's a nice little romance, plenty of drama and suffering for the cause, and Mara is spunky in a very modern vampire slayer kind of way.

I wish I could read it all over again. Five Stars easy, it was a million times better than my last book.Mara was a delight, she was a sweet little trickster who didn't know which people to side with. Whichever side she chose to spy for, there was danger and intrigue. From robing the dead in their crypts' to appearing before Pharaoh, Mara gets entangled in it all. She plays both sides, but what will she do when both realize her duplicity? This book was so much better than I'd thought it would be, I was afraid it would have a modern feel to it, but instead, I felt that I was right next to Mara, doing my utmost to outwit them all. I think this book is timeless.Did I say it was beautiful? It is beautiful. G rating There is, of course, the Egyptian Gods and Burials pomp also there is a whipping at the end, which is not described in a sickening way.

For being written in 1953, Mara is a surprisingly strong female character, a slave-turned-spy for two opposing masters. She's smart, quick on her feet, speaks Babylonian, plays both sides, and even stands up under torture. The romance novel aspects are the least interesting elements, not because they're particularly silly but just because McGraw's beautiful descriptions of ancient Eygpt's people, lands, and politics are so engaging it's hard to pay attention to the romance. It's irritating that Hatshepsut has been turned into the evil villainess, and the \"fettered king\" whose revolution is being planned isn't described as, ahem, her half-brother and husband (who didn't need a revolution), so it's easier just to read the story as entirely made up.

No hand but mine shall slay that misbegotten Libyan!\""}, {"userName": "Evelynn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8972903-evelynn", "userReview": "Mara intently fixed her gaze on the young man before her, who asked, \"What is the message, Blue Eyed One?\"\"'What are your thoughts?'\" she quoted. \"'Shall you tell me of the plot?

I will get the truth of him.... \"Is this book to you so slight compared to others you have had before?\"\"Nay, not in the least!\"Mara raised her brows slightly. Other than his eyes, which glittered with amusement, the careless smile that returned to Sheftu's face did not tell he knew he had been neatly trapped. Instead of changing the subject, he went on as if his outburst had not been a mistake. \"There were many things that brought it above the rest. Intrigue, betrayal, adventure, romance.... All these things combined made the reading\u2014enjoyable.\"Inwardly, Mara sighed irritably, but did not show her frustration outwardly. Ai, \"enjoyable\"! Sheftu was surely a rogue, as Nekonkh had pointed out before, just not the kind of rogue he referred to. \"But what of your opinion, Sashai?\"\"My opinion of it\u2014is as my opinion of you, guttersnipe, my lovely Mara.\"Mara put on an innocent expression. \"What is your opinion of me, pray?\"Sheftu drew her close, his eyes traveling her face, and Mara\u2019s heart pounded faster. \"That thou are my beloved, Lotus-Eyed One,\" he said slowly, gently. He fingered the lotus in Mara's hair. \"And you always will be.\"Another amazing book by the same author is The Golden Goblet.

Honestly, I couldn't love a book more. One of the first books I ever truly loved, it gets better every time you read it.A very sweet, complicated story about Hatshepsut's reign and ultimate overthrow. And Mara's right in the middle of it, juggling her life and the lives of others that she likes and, maybe, dislikes. She's desperate for good luck, her life has been the \"grab it before somebody else does\" and she realizes throughout the book that sometimes you don't have to. Sometimes it gets handed to you.I appreciate the fact that when she uses Egyptian words she doesn't explain them or have them repeated in English like some authors do. Instead, she has the meaning slipped in without you realizing it.\"Haut meryt, you are mistaken!\" protested Sheftu. \"There is no name better remembered or more honored than yours in all the Black Land.\"\"Honor I never cared for - nor fame or riches - then or now. 'Beloved General,' you call me...\"You almost don't realize when she explains the words, because she doesn't really explain. She just translates subtly.What. An amazing book. Couldn't recommend it more. It's one of the best books I've ever read and that will never change, even though the review might (because it's honestly not a good review if you've read the story - Mara deserves a better review but I suck at writing reviews so...oh well)."}, {"userName": "Jackie B. - Death by Tsundoku", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8952328-jackie-b---death-by-tsundoku", "userReview": "Let's hear it for strong female protagonists found in books published in 1953!Also, let's hear it for being able to describe any book in this way: Spies! Intrigue! Plotting! Romance! Gold! Pharoahs! Swashbuckling! Betrayal! Anguish! Drama!What a captivating story. Now, first things first. The history isn't quite accurate. But, that's okay. This is historical fiction, right? As long as you can ignore the real events, this is a great story. That said-- truth, or lack there of, does not take away from this story. A lot happens in a small period of time. Mara encounters many people during her adventures, and I find them all quite intriguing. What made them to intriguing to me was how perspective switched between them all. We really got to understand this plot as it unfolded from many sides. Now, all those sides happened to be the \"winning\" side, but that's okay. Either way, it really brought depth to the story. For example, Mara is always scheming to try and maintain her double-agent status. She is constantly complimenting herself on how sneaky she is. However, when we see Mara from another perspective-- we learn this isn't 100% the truth. Inanni, the Canaanite princess Mara acts as interpreter for, notices that Mara is acting suspicious. She knows that something is amiss, and we see Mara for what she really is. Yes, crafty. Yes, smart. But flawed. Which is lovely. I recommend this novel to anyone interested in \"Spies! Intrigue! Plotting! Romance! Gold! Pharoahs! Swashbuckling! Betrayal! Anguish! \" or just YA historical fiction. :) So, hopefully, everyone."}, {"userName": "Schuyler", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481557-schuyler", "userReview": "Mara is one of those books that is pure fun to read. All the time you're reading, you're thinking \"this is a good story--a lifetime story--this is why I love books\". It's spy fiction at its tightest, with tiny clues and grand stakes that all weave together into the delicious combination of suspense that I like to experience. This book has everything from midnight meets to tomb robbing (and breaking the royal seals on the tombs was no joke for an Egyptian).The characterization gives food for thought, and is far from a rainbow of happiness, but neither is it one of those gut-wrenching tales that leaves you exhausted and glassy-eyed. When I finished, I had the happy, heart-pumping adrenaline of a story well told that didn't try to knock my emotions out of whack at the same time. I was able to do what I love best: read the story without that hangover angst the next day.The Egyptian culture makes for a unique and beautiful setting. I loved the way McGraw combined the little details of clothing, eye paint, gods, food, and nobility. What made her setting even richer was bringing in a Syrian with completely different culture and value system, and contrasting Mara's love for Egypt with the Syrian Inanni's wariness and disgust. Mara considers Inanni's many shawls frumpy and shapeless, while Inanni considers Mara's sheath-like dress immodest and thin. That's a brilliant way to highlight culture details. The setting alone made me happy. In the midst of my love for countless English/Irish/Scottish tales, having something so gripping set in a very different country like Egypt brought new zest and enchantment to the tale.In reading K.M. Weiland's Structuring Your Novel over the weekend, I constantly remembered Mara, and was pleased by how classy the author's plotting was. From a reading perspective it's a joy, from a writer's perspective it's an example worth emulating. It never dragged, but neither was the action cheesy. McGraw never went over the top and never undersold herself. It hit all the correct crisis points naturally, and crescendoed up to a whammer of a climax that delivered the 100% punch I wanted. McGraw got away with using four or five POVs, but none of them were confusing. Every writer who has a book with any kind of drama in it should read Mara. I would put it in a writing class, or even a literature program for the quality of it.As far as the side I'm still thinking about, Mara is a story set completely within a pagan culture. After being used to something like Haggard, which contains at least some mention of Christianity, it left me wondering how to review it when there was nothing to gain a foothold on from my worldview. Mara contains a lot of lying, which I understood in the context of a spy novel. You can't really have a story about a double spy without it. But still, even when it's necessary, I like to think through it.Last week we learned about an Israeli principle called Pikuach Nefesh. One sect of the Pharisees in the Middle East held that loving God and loving their neighbor were the highest commandments. If you had to lie or break the Sabbath to love your neighbor, then the loving came first. In many ways, Mara makes me think of that, as she makes choices to sacrifice for the spies and king she loves. Though I don't think the author had that principle in mind, and I myself have reservations about it, understanding Pikuach Nefesh helped me process this book as a Christian reader. This is how a poor, non-Christian Egyptian girl would realistically act, and I can respect the consistency of her viewpoint without embracing all of her moral choices.In spite of the deceit factor, there are certain things the characters will not do, come torture or whipping or death. They act by their moral code, and they respect it, even if they swear by all the gods of Egypt in the process. Two things that shine clear are patriotism and deep sacrifice for the well-being of Egypt.For readers who like to look out for romance, Mara contains a significant amount. It was a full-blooded, mature romance, not a shallow and saccharine one. But even though it didn't trouble me, some readers may not care for it. :)"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy", "userReview": "2018 ReviewStill one of my favorite historical fiction novels.

I'm far from being an Egyptologist, but I've traveled to Egypt and spent enough time in the Egyptian galleries of various museums to know that McGraw gets all sorts of little details correct: the right hand to left shoulder salute, the jewelry and clothing, the terrifying tombs in the Valley of the Kings. No one knows what ancient Egyptian sounded like, but McGraw mixes in enough likely phrases to make the dialog quite believable. I knocked off one star because I thought both of Mara's new masters were too casual in their oversight of this 'agent', and not menacing enough; also I wish we had learned more of Mara's past history, especially how she learned to read and move so easily among the upper classes.But no matter, it was a delightful book and definitely rated G for general audiences (except, of course, this is ancient Egypt, so there are oodles of pagan gods and weird burial practices)."}, {"userName": "Suzannah", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13906136-suzannah", "userReview": "I am embarrassed to admit how much I love this book."}, {"userName": "\u2665\u2133elody", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4439079-elody", "userReview": "Aaaaaah.

I would particularly recommend it to tween/teen girls. It's exactly the sort of romantic adventure I would have loved to death at that age. I still love it now, but that's because there's a little tween girl still living inside of me--a little tween girl who would have been frightened and thrilled by the action and more than a little intrigued by the dashing hero, Sheftu. He's totally the guy young girls dream of having an adventure with. You can tell the book was written in the early 20th century. This is mostly good. The overall feel is an appealing mix of Alfred Hitchcock with The Ten Commandments. It's not really a historical book at all, in spite of all the researched details. It's a fairy tale---a dashing twist on Cinderella--and very suspenseful. This is no cozy mystery where you're sure the heroine won't end up getting hurt. The plot is fast-paced, unpredictable, and the reader is never certain of the safety of any of the characters. Danger takes center stage and reigns supreme. In fact, it's a miracle Mara and Sheftu both didn't get killed. The risks they were taking were just incredible. The book is outstanding. There are only a very few flaws I noticed, and I typically mention any flaws I saw in a review, so here goes..1: The Princess Inanni of Canaan is a good character in herself, but the incessant snide commentary on her weight and the weight of her ladies-in-waiting makes the book seem dated and the heroine, Mara, unkind. Weight comments are a problem in a lot of the popular fiction of that era. I felt this hurt Mara's character a little bit. We were told she's a smart girl and remarkably practical. That isn't consistent with vaguely disliking someone because of her weight---the Princess is a useful friend for Mara ( in fact, without her Mara would undoubtedly have died) and a smart girl would know better than to let physical traits get in the way of making friends. 2: During a thrilling scene inside a pyramid the hero, Sheftu, hesitates to kill a man who is certain to betray him to the authorities. This didn't feel believable to me. A guy like Sheftu is too tough and too smart to be merciful. He can't afford to be a gentleman when he's also an outlaw and a spy. That's a shame, but it's true, and Sheftu hesitating made him look less convincing as a tough guy.That's enough criticism for one review! To wrap it up...great book, but not perfect. I've yet to find a perfect book, so Mara still gets 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Shantelle", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5482096-shantelle", "userReview": "Mara, Daughter of the Nile was a superb novel. I was surprised and delighted by the depth of the story, the crazy awesomeness of the plot, and... yes, the entire book in and of itself.A richly historical book to be sure. We explore Egypt and her culture, customs, kings and queens. Of course, this historical depth includes mentions of gods and goddesses, and also a slightly creepy scene down in the tombs of Egypt's dead kings. That I could have done without.But yes, the overall story was just very well done. A fascinating plot, equally fascinating (thought at times radical) characters, and an unexpectedly sweet and even swoon-y romance. :)Mara, who starts out as a thoroughly rebellious slave, was quite proud at times. A little too proud. But as the end of the book came about, you certainly watched her character change to that of something better. She softened, though her wild, passionate spirit remained as steadfast and loyal as ever. Her eventual beloved was quite the mysterious man. Caring one moment, loftily teasing the next, and darkly intense the next. You can't really blame her for falling for him.I don't think I've read a book quite like this before. It was surprising, breathtaking, and quite startling at points. Really a story to keep you hustling back to its pages once you get into it.As I always say, I prefer a strong spiritual theme. -Which Mara, Daughter of the Nile obviously doesn't have. Oh it has religion, but that of the Egyptian legends and whatnot. But I can certainly appreciate it as a very good historical read, and just very good story-writing overall! :)"}, {"userName": "Sherwood Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162084-sherwood-smith", "userReview": "I think this was the first book that turned me on to historical fiction.

But it was a fun read! It has a Disney-princess-esque heroine, spunky and beautiful and smart, who gets caught up in a web of political intrigue. The Egyptian stuff wasn't nearly as hokie as I expected, although they are inside a pyramid at one point. Anyway, it seems from Goodreads reviews that 10-12 year old girls are prone to fall in love with this book and think fondly of it throughout their lives, and they certainly could do worse."}, {"userName": "Sharla", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11905458-sharla", "userReview": "I love this story. I loved it even more the second time reading it. It is the type of book that I only find once in a blue moon. Immensely intriguing, fast-paced, captivating characters, and edgy yet lighthearted enough to keep me from spending days bemoaning the darkness of mankind.\u00a0 It took me to ancient Egypt. With all its flowery over the top descriptions (which I loved), it brought me to the bank of the Nile watching the ships sail into the dark. I got see a world ablaze with ambition, hope and desperation.Pros:The characters are\u00a0 extremely clever. I love clever characters. You know the saying \"you can be too clever\"? I think this book perfectly illustrates and refutes that concept.The story flows well, never resting too long in one spot.The setting. It is set in ancient Egypt. That is pretty sweet. Don't argue with me on that. (Actually do argue, I like to argue. It is interesting, I get to hear different opinions. Argue away in the comments. I want to hear it all!)Sheftu & Mara. Talk about romance. Talk about sparks. Talk about chemistry. Talk about two characters with dynamite personalities! These two were well-matched. It was superb clash and contrast between the two. I dislike books where the girl is weak willed, or is stubborn but rather stupid. Or even worse, when a character starts out strong-willed and spirited but they fall in love and turn into a sappy mess. That does not happen here. Instead I found Mara to be not just spirited, but smart and incredibly clever. Sheftu was equally clever and I find nothing so satisfying as witnessing two characters match wits.Cons:I would say that it is too short, but that's not true. Making it longer would have lessened this story's potency and made it weaker.I like this book exactly as it is."}, {"userName": "Hayden", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21854176-hayden", "userReview": "I have a feeling this may end up being re-read in the future ;)"}, {"userName": "Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2267349-taylor", "userReview": "HORRIBLE SRUPID BORING BOOK THAT I HAD TO READ FOR SCHOOL"}, {"userName": "Sonal", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22218283-sonal", "userReview": "This book is delightful. Set in ancient Egypt, during the reign of Hatshepsut; it is a story of a beautiful blue-eyed, witty slave girl Mara who dreams of freedom & riches and gets a chance at it when she is bought, to spy and find the rebel leader in the pharaoh's court. While on her journey on the Nile, she crosses path with the handsome courtier Sheftu, planning a coup to place Thutmosis III on the throne. Caught while eavesdropping on the boat, she is forced to be a messenger to Thutmosis on his behalf. Mara is now trapped to act as a double agent and finds herself in the center of it all.Mara's wits and saucy tongue helps her get through initially until she starts falling for Lord Sheftu when she decides to choose sides and bear the consequences.This is a thrilling story filled with plenty of drama, nail-biting suspense, romance & adventure. Author's description of the setting is magnificent -the journey on the Nile, the building of temple complexes, slaves & torture, ancient protective charms, Tomb raiding and lot more. The plot is fast paced & captivating. When I was about 1/3rd through the book, I just couldn't keep it down for all the mystery it created. An impressive work of historical fiction by McGraw. I am definitely going to check out her other works."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710785-katie", "userReview": "I read this a week ago, so on one level, WHO KNOWS?
