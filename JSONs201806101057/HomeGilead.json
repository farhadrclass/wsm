( even those last three words don't really fit-but it communicates quickly for 'short-review' purposes). \"HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS\".....( not always)\"YOU CAN NEVER RETURN HOME\"....( sometimes you can)HOME....has a deep emotional meaning and our memories of....love, life, family opinions and feeling, anger, grief, regrets, betrayal, friendships, joy, religious beliefs, assumptions, forgiveness, judgments and prejudices, foods, books, gardening, secrets, sins, accomplishments, disappointments, finances, illness & hurts, blessings, sadness, on and on.... and it's ALL explored in \"HOME\". HOME also represents our success and failures with our PARENTS & SIBLINGS. HOME provides safety and comfort: ( not always for each family member)HOME is a way of understanding ourselves and the way the world is constructed around us. ( our egos, our spirituality, our knowledge, our awareness, our integrity, and humanity). In Marilynne Robinson's \"HOME\"...I was able to imagine myself being 'each' of the characters. I could imagine being Glory- the young woman who returns home to care for her father--( a temporary refuge from her own problems)--Or...Jack, the \"wrongdoer\" - pegged black sheep of the family --Or...PAPA...Reverend Boughton...sick, old, dying, a widower. These characters, and minor characters - become real people to us. The dialogue engages us. The writing is beautiful and brilliant and provokes 'looking-within'. A Wonderful book from which I drew strength!!! 5+++ stars! Ok... this got a little too long... out the door to walk!!!! I'm retired!!!

There was not one false note in this entire book. People acted in this book how they actually do in real life (at least in my experience). Their feelings of love and anger and self-hate were so acute, I often found myself relating to each character more than once. Maybe some of this comes from where I am emotionally right now\u2014somewhere teetering between hope and devastation. I am struggling with these two emotions every day, every minute, as are more than one of the characters in this book. Characters who have had their dreams dashed or have never let themselves think they're worthy of having dreams. [I related so much to their feelings, I think I wept during the last 60 pages or so, sentimental cuss that I am.:]Love, too, finds a prominent place here. The love between a sister and a brother and a father and a son, both relationships I am quite familiar with. The disappointments, the pride, the desire to help, the desire to flee and hide. The book is written from the viewpoint of Glory, a woman in her late 30s who has returned to her childhood home after a collapsed engagement to care for her elderly father. She is hardworking, caring, but bitter. She feels as though she cannot escape her lot in life, and envies her siblings who all went off and started their own families. Except for her brother Jack, who disappeared 20 years ago and has suddenly returned home. Jack is aloof, sad, self-deprecating, lost, and confused. He was always the black sheep of the family\u2014the preacher's son who became thief and miscreant. He is constantly haunted by his past actions and his sense of self-worthlessness. Every day is a struggle for him emotionally, and he is blind to see that others may truly love him, regardless of his behavior. It is this Jack who returns home suddenly to spend time with Glory and their father. Boughton, the father, is a former Presbyterian minister. He vacillates between the blind love of a father to his son and an undeniable fury of the disappointment his son has been. Jack has not only wrestled with moral behavior, but also has become an agnostic (maybe even atheist), wanting to believe in something, but unable to cross that line. This devastates Boughton perhaps more than anything else. And so, the book follows the weeks in which Jack has appeared and asked to stay with his father and sister, both of whom grow to have changing feelings about Jack's return, switching roles from resentment to familial love. There were so many themes here that I relished seeing play out between these characters [who are, incidentally, all supporting characters from Robinson's other fantastic book, Gilead:]: love, resentment, redemption, guilt, one's certainty or uncertainty of faith, depression, self-hatred, care, loss, loneliness, hope, and\u2014of course\u2014familial relationships. Robinson has a clean, clear sense of prose that allows characters to bloom into themselves, revealing deep connections with themselves, their feelings, and the world. Great book."}, {"userName": "Jim Fonseca", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca", "userReview": "A well-respected retired Presbyterian minister is old and in ill health in a small town in Iowa. He\u2019s a widower with eight children; four boys, four girls. He ran a tight religious ship at home: regular church attendance, grace at every meal, Bible reading, no swearing, etc. Six of the kids \u201cdid well.\u201d They married, had kids of their own, and are \u201csuccessful.\u201d The two children who took other paths \u2013 the misfits - are now home taking care of him. The story centers on the few months or so when they are with their father as his health deteriorates. In the following, I\u2019m not really giving away any plot \u2013 there isn\u2019t much - and we pretty much know all the following near the beginning of the story. The woman, Glory, late thirties, is back after a long-term unsuccessful affair out of town. She led her family to believe she was married and that it didn\u2019t work out. The son, Jack, a few years older than Glory, has bigger problems. Ever since he was a kid he was a semi-juvenile delinquent. He had a baby by a local woman out of wedlock. Now he\u2019s an alcoholic and more-or-less a drifter; he may or may not have other women or other kids out of town; he steals and has been in prison, although he\u2019s on his best behavior during the visit. He hasn\u2019t been back home for twenty years, not even coming home for his mother\u2019s funeral. Given the religious theme of the novel, he is truly the prodigal son. Even their names say something about them. Glory thinks at some point to this effect: the boys were named after PEOPLE (mostly Biblical \u2013 David, John, Luke); the girls after immaterial things: Faith, Hope, Grace and Glory. (Because Gloria sounded too southern-European apparently).With the human tendency to see the glass half-full, instead of being happy with his successful children, Jack totally occupies his father\u2019s mind as it declines. \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Other than feeling bad for Glory that she is \u201csad,\u201d he pretty much ignores the fact that she is devastated and feels that she has wasted her life and has no idea what to do next. In the author\u2019s great words: \u201c\u2026the gradual catastrophe of her own venture into the world had come to an end\u2026\u201dThe father says he loves his son and forgives him. He annoyingly tells him so just about every day. But we learn this is an intellectual exercise: it is Glory who truly loves and truly forgives her brother.The only other major character in the book is an older neighbor, a Congregational minster, who is a daily visitor to the house. He knew Jack as a wild young boy. He doesn\u2019t fool with forgiveness: he hates Jack. But from his strict religious upbringing, Jack knows his Bible and he likes to jerk the strings of both his father and the minister neighbor. He loves to bring up the idea of predestination, more or less, \u201cGod made me a lying, shiftless alcoholic \u2013 how do we deal with that?\u201d The story is set around the mid-1950\u2019s when the civil rights movement began in Montgomery and pictures of police brutality were broadcast nightly on black and white TV. The two ministers come down on the side of law and order and of Eisenhower; Jack sides with the marchers and is a Stevenson man and almost a Marxist. The book is a bit slow in places, and Jack\u2019s behavior as an alcoholic doesn\u2019t seem too realistic compared to ones we know, but this is still a good read. Of the three books of this author I have read, I liked Housekeeping best and I thought Gilead really dragged. I notice the publisher is now subtitling this book Gilead 2 (the name of the town it is set in) and the older one, Gilead 1. photo from inwanderlust.weebly.com"}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "\u201cHome\u201d is not a sequel to \u201cGilead\u201d, it is a story that lapses at the same time but told from a different perspective. In fact, this novel could easily be read as a treatise about family, a sort of rich catalog of the varied ways in which a father can hurt a son, a brother can hurt a sister, or vice versa, precisely because they love each other. It\u2019s a sad story about miscommunication and failed good intentions wasted over the years that lead to an anticlimactic peak of boundless frustration.The Prodigal Son Jack Boughton, returns home after twenty years of absence. A drunk, a thief, a man of disreputable character, problematic since his childhood days, he returns to a dying father and his saintly sister Glory, who is taking care of him. Theological meditations and moral dilemmas become the still frame of every unsuccessful attempt at conversation between the members of the Boughton family. Old Reverend Boughton is bitterly disappointed in his son but his love for him is unconditional, and following his religious beliefs, he treats him with deference and kindness, forgiving his transgressions even before he has time to commit them. Jack senses his father\u2019s wariness in his tentative approaches, and his frail recovery is dampened by the painful memories of past mistakes that were too grave to be obviated. He stops believing in himself the moment he is welcomed by his family. Glory witnesses the slow deterioration of both men while her own suffering goes unaccounted for, taken for granted by her father and condescendingly petted by her reprobate brother.There is no action to speak of, or unexpected turns in this quiet, evocative book. Told in confessional first person, the narrative voice acquires a universal dimension that transcends the thoughts and emotions of the characters, reaching the core of the reader, regardless of his familiarity with the religious currents, Presbyterian or Congregationalist, that flood this novel.Robinson plays with the idea that family should be like an invisible paradise, that home should be the place one can always return to, a safe haven to mend before heading back into the world.Reality is much more complicated, and human nature is an intricate tangle of resentment, guilt and inconsistence that can\u2019t be tamed by spiritual piety. Amidst the subtle elegance of Robinson\u2019s accomplished style, amidst the reflective quality of her exploration of family, faith and redemption, I couldn\u2019t help but sense the acute sting of judgment, not only of poor Jack, who can\u2019t forgive himself, but also for those who seek for answers beyond the realm of piety. Even though I felt like a kind of outsider by the end of the novel, even though I can\u2019t identify with Robinson\u2019s views on grace and forgiveness, I can\u2019t ignore the mastery of her writing and her capacity to elevate the ordinary to the divine. Going back home might not be what we all expected, what we need after all, but maybe it\u2019s the only thing we can do. Regardless."}, {"userName": "Schmacko", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko", "userReview": "This book is simply beautiful and heartbreaking.I started getting emotional, tears started welling up on page 26, when I read this about a sister awaiting her prodigal brother\u2019 homecoming after twenty years of his absence:\"Glory had her own hopes, which were also too high \u2013 that this visit would happen at all, that it would be interesting, and that Jack would not remember her as the least tolerable, the most officious, the least to be trusted of all his brothers and sisters. She thought and hoped he might not remember her at all.\"I wish I could encourage everyone to read this book; I wish I had the ability to write about how profound and wondrous and sad this book is. Most people won\u2019t read this book, because they just don\u2019t read. Some will dislike this story\u2019s religious overtones. They\u2019ll also notice it\u2019s a small domestic tale set in southwestern Iowa. And then they\u2019ll say there are no car crashes, eviscerations, pirates, alien monsters, superpowers, and murders; no raping, pillaging and plundering to keep them turning pages.Home is simply a story about family, about feeling a foreigner in your own house, about forgiveness and gentleness and grace. It\u2019s the third book by an author who won the Pulitzer a few years ago for the small book Gilead. Gilead \u2013 set in the mid 1950s - was about John Ames, a dying minister, an old groom writing letters as an inheritance to his unexpected, young son. In these letters, Reverend Ames tells his young son about three generations of Ames ministers. There was the violently abolitionist grandfather (who fought and lost and eye in the Kansas Wars), his pacifist father (who refused to serve in WWI), and then his own place in this progeny. Gilead is the name of their small fictional town. It was a book that required patience but rewarded with poetry, sensibility, and mercy.Home is the other side of that same story. Ames\u2019 best friend since they were eight was a Presbyterian minister Robert Boughton. Boughton had eight kids, one who he named after Ames. This son, Jack (as he asks to be called) is the black sheep of the Boughton clan, but he is also the most loved. He was a petty thief, a vandal, and a loner. When he was in college, he came home and got a sixteen-year-old pregnant and then abandoned her and his own family, running away not to be heard from for twenty years.When Jack does return - rough, bone-thin, and hung over \u2013 he finds his dad is dying. The old minister is being watched after by the youngest daughter, Glory, who is trying to hide that her eight-year engagement has ended in abandonment. (The book is told with special attention to Glory\u2019s perspective.) Together, Glory and Reverend Boughton try to make Jack feel at home in the home he always felt alien in. They try to practice Christian grace, and they try to help this prodigal son plagued by his own ghosts, his unmet hopes, criminal behavior, alcoholism, depression, and his self-loathing. That\u2019s about all I could tell you. The rest, if you have the patience (there are no chapters, just small divided sections, for all 314 pages), is filled with small-town events and heart-breaking revelations. I will admit, I am from southern Iowa, in the same area of Robinson\u2019s fictional town of Gilead. Like Jack, I am also from a large family, and I am the black sheep, the one who never felt at home in his parents\u2019 house. I understand Jack\u2019s want to belong, and yet an entire lifetime of family history has informed him that he is different from his many brothers and sisters; I understand when he states that he wished he could just walk through the door and be as comfortable as his siblings did, doing homework at the table, belonging. I also know the quiet and merciful religiosity of Home, the grace that tries to reach Jack and help him not knowing that its beauty and generosity only makes him feel less deserving and more foreign.I cried a lot while reading  Home. I still am, trying to tell you about it."}, {"userName": "CK", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108460-ck", "userReview": "I love this book. I had a good, long weep after finishing it. But that's not why I love it. I've been sitting here trying to analyze exactly why I love it so much but words are failing me \u2014 and you know that never happens. So here goes. Her other books are also wonderful, but this one makes me sure that Marilynne Robinson is one of the greatest writers alive today. That it is original is an understatement. I could talk about how I think she's establishing a new literary genre, but the truth is, I don't really know enough to talk like that \u2014 even if I heartily suspect that my great-grandchildren will be studying her in their literature classes. I only know the effect her work has on me. It's breathtaking, heartbreaking and alarming like nothing I've ever read before; and at the same time piercingly subtle, humble, gentle and wonderful. It horrifies me before I even know I'm being horrified, when I think I'm safe. Like watching dust motes float in the sunshine streaming in through a quiet window and suddenly understanding what it means to be human.I can see how some people would read this book (or her other two) and be bored, or just not get it. Her words command a sort of attention that's not common these days, and that takes some energy; and on the surface, the plot progresses slowly and seems quite benign. But the wonder of these stories! The gut-wrenching power of them. Each story is bigger than the sum of its parts. Her work is entirely and gloriously subversive, in the best sense. In Home, she takes what seems to be a bucolic tale of a small town, drenched in subtle family dynamics and old-time religion, and turns it into a tale of hopeless human depravity and extraordinary, confounding redemption. But it's not gothic. There are no apocalyptic visions, no supernatural interventions, no blood and violence. It's not epic or modernist, either \u2014 and despite all of the religious overtones (and undertones), it's not a morality tale, not at all. Her characters are unassuming. The settings are modest. There aren't any freaks, despots, heroes or villains. How does she pull it off? She doesn't rely on any of the tricks or shocking contrasts that other writers use to make the reader feel the horror and weight of the problem at hand. It looks like pottery, but feels like gold; heavy, spare, significant, rich. Home is not just a companion piece to Gilead; it surpasses Gilead. Gilead was a preparation, a working-up-to-this-one. Interesting, now, to think about Gilead in light of Home \u2014 perhaps it is not as innocuous as I originally thought. I may have to re-read it. With each novel, Robinson's work progresses and opens further and deeper and sends out creeper vines into as-yet unexplored literary territory.

{"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "5+ stars. The hope that I will find a book like this one is the reason I read.Home. A word that conveys so many different meanings that for each person it is as individual as a fingerprint. For Jack Boughton, it is a place he has run from, longed for, and never quite fit into. For his sister, Glory, it is a place she loves, wishes to escape from, but knows she will be tied to all of her life. Thomas Wolfe told us \u201cyou can never go home again\u201d, Marilynne Robinson seems to say you can never leave home at all.As complicated as the concept of Home is, forgiveness might be even more complicated. God dispenses grace and calls for man to forgive, but can man truly forgive? The two venerable pastors in this novel, Robert Boughton and John Ames, certainly talk about forgiveness as though it is something they understand and aspire to, but neither of them seems capable of true forgiveness. Robert can never look beyond the past to see the man Jack truly is, and, because Jack is his namesake, Ames counts every trespass as an affront to his good name. Neither of them is able to embrace the change in Jack. They look at the man, but they always and forever see the boy. Glory, who has always struggled to understand who her elusive brother Jack was, is the one person who is able to look at who he is without flinching. She offers hope in what feels like a pretty hopeless situation. If there is a home to come to for Jack, Glory embodies it.We wonder why the past cannot be purged, when the present and the future are so tenuous. Why is Jack back, after all these years, to endure this endless flogging? Like Robert Frost\u2019s hired man, Jack knows \u2018Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in.\u2019 But, he is hoping the truth will lie in \u2018I should have called it Something you somehow haven\u2019t to deserve.\u2019 Robinson says, \"Weary or bitter or bewildered as we may be, God is faithful. He lets us wander so we will know what it means to come home.\" But that implies a sweetness in the homecoming that eludes these characters no matter how they try to have it otherwise.If you come from a perfect family in which the members have always understood and loved one another, you might not register the impact of this story. If you come from a family who have loved one another, but always found understanding one another difficult, it might be like looking in a mirror. If you have ever felt outside in places that you know should have been your comfort zone, Jack will resonate with you, and if you have ever had a sibling that you loved but felt estranged from, Jack will make you cry.I loved Robinson\u2019s Gilead. I built my own backstory for Jack Boughton and thought I had a fair idea of who Glory and Robert were. I was anxious to know more about those characters, but what I got in Home was so much more than I could ever have imagined. Seeing Ames side of the story, and then Jack\u2019s, was so revealing about the character of human beings, how often we view life only in the context of what it means to us, for us, when the motivation of the other person can be so different and not about \u201cus\u201d at all.I am on to Lila and the final leg of this journey. I highly recommend this series to everyone who wants to grapple for a little while with the larger questions in life. Not good vs. evil, but man\u2019s incapacity to sort good from evil, to understand the depths of the human heart, to touch another man\u2019s soul. Glory asks Jack what he thinks the soul is, perhaps that is the question for all of us and to know the answer to our own soul we must try to understand someone else\u2019s.As for home, I leave you with this thought from Marilynne Robinson:\"Home. What kinder place could there be on earth, and why did it seem to them all like exile? Oh, to be passing anonymously, through an impersonal landscape! Oh not to know every stump and stone, not to remember how the fields of Queen Anne\u2019s lace figured in the childish happiness they had offered to their father\u2019s hopes.\"Oh to carry no past, to have no hurts, no scars, no disappointments, no calamitous youth to haunt your present. Oh to be perfect and not need forgiveness, or perhaps to only be perfect enough to be able to forgive."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "I hate to say this as it sounds so trite and I\u2019m certainly not religious but this is indeed one of those novels that has been touched by the hand of grace. Marilynne Robinson in her unique inimitable way has produced a sublime work that exquisitely captures the life of Reverend Boughton and his children Glory and Jack. This novel encapsulates the ideals of family life and solidarity regardless of what becomes of them and what is so touching is that Jack, the wayward son, who did everything out of sync, be it theft, drunkenness, etc. still retained the love of his father and even greater than Jack\u2019s other siblings. The book actually quite overwhelmed me in this sense of forgiveness and yet of love in Reverend Boughton\u2019s waiting and waiting for his wayward son, his doubts and misgivings and finally when Jack returns, well it was worth it.As Reverend Boughton\u2019s life draws to a close, his long suffering daughter Glory is close by his side, easing him through this troubled time but his lifeline is Jack, his mercurial child but still so loved.This is not a fast moving book but one to be deliciously savoured as a good Medoc. Hidden aspects are constantly uncovered and the lyrical writing of Robinson, especially her descriptions, adds such beauty that will not be seen again for a long time. There\u2019s such a spirit of place about this book. Glory, who had loved her brother as a child, now finds him difficult but slowly they develop a mutual love and it is rather splendid to see.I consider Jack comparable to the elusive kingfisher with its fleeting appearance above the river bank, the flash of electric blue that brings that magical aspect, be it somewhat ephemeral to a human somehow but it nevertheless manages to project the soul of Jack, despite his misdemeanors into a powerful personality not to be reckoned with.It\u2019s also interesting to see how Jack\u2019s relationship with Reverend Boughton\u2019s closest friend, the Reverend John Ames develops. Plus the latter\u2019s rather unique wife Laila, a former itinerant and now fully ensconced into the church and yet, despite her happy contented life, she remains unsettled. She views her much loved elderly husband and knows that she will see his burial and then, perhaps the bird of paradise will escape from her gilded cage that has so suited her for the moment. She doesn\u2019t know. It is delightful to see John Ames face as he observes his wife. It is as though he will never know what she will project and he continues to be entranced by her...Touching.A remarkable and sobering book. Much loved by me and to be reread many times."}, {"userName": "ZaRi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26168013-zari", "userReview": "\u0634\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0628\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0686\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0646\u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0631 \u06a9\u0633 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u0642 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u06a9\u0646\u062f.\u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u060c\u0647\u0631\u06af\u0632 \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0622\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 \u062c\u0632 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a. \u0647\u0631\u0686\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u0633\u06cc\u0631 \u0648 \u0633\u0641\u0631 \u062f\u0631 \u0641\u0636\u0627\u06cc \u0622\u06a9\u0627\u062f\u0645\u06cc\u06a9 \u0648 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0630\u062a\u0628\u062e\u0634 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0632\u0647 \u062f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0645 \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628 \u0645\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u062f.\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u061b\u062a\u0631\u062c\u06cc\u062d \u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631 \u0642\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0648 \u062f\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u06a9\u0646\u0645 \u062a\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u0634.\" \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647\" \u0631\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u06af\u0630\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0645\u0634 \u062c\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631\u061b\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0622\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0646 \u062a\u0627 \u0645\u062f\u062a\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0633\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0631\u0641\u062a..."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157031-matt", "userReview": "Maybe I'm missing something, or I'm too young, or maybe nothing can live up to the expectations I had for this after Housekeeping and Gilead, or maybe I read it too fast, but I seriously found this book incredibly boring. I liked the beginning and the end, and the book does a good job of building the relationship between estranged brother and sister slowly, almost imperceptibly, over time, which felt very true. But mostly reading this book felt like watching a play in which all the characters repress their stupid feelings all the time and never say what they mean and have really boring conversations for three acts and then go on being sad. And, yeah, Gilead's a boring book, too, but it's so beautiful and revelatory that it doesn't matter that basically nothing happens.

I always felt as though I was reading it in the morning, just at that exact moment when the majestic rays of the rising sun feel most wonderful. Not too hot, not too bright, just right. It was radiant, I felt like it gave a stir to my bones, an energy of some sort, a source of strength. It's funny really, because the book treads on a slow, probably careful albeit graceful pace. It would probably have been a five-star, had it not spent much time serving the appetizer before getting to the main course. Mind you, though, this appetizer is really most delectable. It's one of those stories that graph a flat line till the much awaited climax. What's interesting to note is that Madame Robinson writes with a rich and resonant tone that nullifies the evenness and stagnancy of the tale. I was conscious of the slow progress, yet I never once felt bored. This novel is a meditation on human capacity. It questions the limits of our ability to forgive. It delves into the cracks of our self-control. It wallows in the nature of empathy and the reasons behind it. It measures the distance that unrequited love will walk. It examines regret and why we do things that lead to it. And it presents us with the reality that self-destruction isn't limited to the destruction of one's self. That the shrapnel of destruction reaches those people that care for you, that love you, that you destroy them as well. Religion plays an important part in this story. The tale actually revolves around the estranged family of a reverend. So as can be expected, theology is used as medium when looking through the problems aforementioned. To my unbelieving comrades, no worries, an unbelieving son equalizes the playing field. He is often playfully sarcastic to the point of heresy. Doctrines are questioned and scriptures are misused, but he means well. It was one of the most important moments for me when the unbelieving son says he doesn't quite believe, but he understands. \u201cIt is possible to know the great truths without feeling the truth of them.\u201dWe all have differences of opinion, it should not be our aim to convert others to our view but rather to make them understand. Coming from a very religious family, I am quite different in my views with them. I still believe in God, but I am not one with certain things they believe in, especially those that appear rather dogmatic, but I understand why they believe such things and I respect it. Enough about me. Now, there are especially interesting discussions about the soul, grace, perdition, predestination, standard controversial theology. But it provides these, this spirituality in a certain light that doesn't glare at those who read it. It suffuses this spirituality with humanity that feels natural, in a way. It feels almost personal. Yet at the heart of it all, this is about healing and hope in the very place of the ones we hold dear, family. All this set in the midst of a very normal, some would say boring, life. But that's reality, life isn't filled with surprises, plot twists, and sudden reveals. Life is often repetitive, a cycle on a day-to-day basis, minor in its alterations. The greatness of Marilynne Robinson lies with the fact that she writes such breath-taking novels based on this normalcy, this circularity that many of us hate. She opens our eyes on the potential beauty of real life. Her language is evanescent yet elegant, suffusing richness and familiarity that really feels, in a way, homely. The simplicity of it all, both prose and plot, is its strength, enriching and enlivening the reader. In this way, the novel is as real as it gets. It feels so genuine, thus having the rare power of producing tears in the most commonplace events. I remember being reduced to pieces by a joke, a simple joke. This master-work touched me countless of times, especially in the latter half of it. It is rarely acknowledged, but there are a great many books that are self-conscious of their produced melancholy, books that beg you to well-up and cry a river. We are often aware of these things, yet can't still help ourselves. Oh, the drama. But, I assure you this is not of those kinds. This will warm your heart, fill your body with joy, your thoughts with appreciation, with a certain grace, with that fleeting feeling of faith, maybe not in God, but in life. That it goes on. That there's always hope. That redemption is always at hand no matter what.\"There's so much to be grateful for...\""}, {"userName": "Ned", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21232850-ned", "userReview": "This hit me right in the heart. The characters are so deep and finely drawn, yet never overstated, always with the subtle threads of their actions and the revealing dialogue. I grew up in similar climes, in smallish towns in the Midwest, where it all happens. Robinson treats believers with great respect; she recapitulates their quiet and earnest struggles with truth, god and mortality in a special way. There\u2019s not a lot of plot here, in fact some might find this absolutely dry and plodding. But I know these people, they are mine, and they are true. The \u201cgood\u201d daughter, Glory, youngest of eight, returns to take care of her aging father, the former reverend. He is still preternaturally bereft of his one lost sheep, his troubled son Jack, who suddenly appears. Glory and Jack thus find themselves in middle age, stuck in their childhood home together with their father in a final struggle to understand each other, and time is running out. The father\u2019s health is failing and Jack is returning after 20 years of total absence, not even showing for his mother\u2019s funeral. There\u2019s a lifetime of fresh tension to unpack here, and the history is revealed slowly and cleverly as the estranged try to make sense of \u201chome\u201d and family. Jack is a seeker, but he does not find, and his tragedy permeates the lives of the others, and the extended family, plus his father\u2019s best friend (the protagonist in the first story, Gilead). Robinson builds this slowly, almost in an old-fashioned way, but with deft writing and relentless honesty. It\u2019s a beautiful and tragic story, and how it turns out is totally unpredictable (my favorite type of novel). It takes on the biggest questions of predestination and the essential goodness of God. I could relate the mental contortions of Jack, who knows the bible far better than his father and his father\u2019s friend, and shyly takes them to task in a way that disturbs them deeply. His intelligence and wit is tragically lost on his sense of failure, keeping him on the edge of alcoholism and senseless petty crime. The first book, Gilead, introduces the fearful Jack as a sinister force \u2013 but Home shows the true character of this fated figure who can\u2019t find redemption and can\u2019t escape the judgment of those he loves. There is a kinship in the brother and sister, but both are nervous and awkward, despite only having each other to confide in.This book may make you cry, the desperate gaunt Jack who can\u2019t find love, his sister who laments her inability to help him, and the father who cannot pull his one failure back into the fold. I underlined so many great passages. This is the second in a series and it makes me want to go back to the first to see what I missed. If the third (Lila) is like the first two, the triad will be like one beautiful epic. It\u2019s the kind of story and writing that makes me love to read. There\u2019s goodness and heartache and all the things we experience, and told artfully and, most importantly, honestly. There aren\u2019t many books like this in the world."}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "After sleeping with the emotional state this book left me in, I have edited my review and changed it to a solid five stars. \"It is a book unsparing in its acknowledgment of sin and unstinting in its belief in the possibility of grace.

Thanks to the reviews of the members here, I have been much more successful at finding books that appeal to me and are worth my time. One of the books that I read this year as a result of GoodReads reviews was \u201cGilead\u201d by Marilynne Robinson. \u201cGilead\u201d was one of the most profoundly moving books I have ever read. It touched my heart in a way that few books ever do. It spoke of faith and forgiveness in such a reverent manner. I may have to review my top-10 list and find a way to make room for \u201cGilead\u201d on it.The thing about \u201cGilead\u201d is that it was a stand-alone novel. It had an ending that was natural and made sense. It left no room for a sequel. Robinson\u2019s latest novel set in the Iowa town of Gilead, \u201cHome\u201d, is not a sequel. Instead, it is a parallel novel. It takes place in the same time period as \u201cGilead\u201d, but is told from the point of view of the youngest Boughton child, Glory. Glory is a 38-year-old spinster who comes home to take care of her aging father. Some time after she arrives, her wayward brother, Jack, comes home after a twenty-year absence. \u201cHome\u201d examines the relationship that develops between Jack and Glory as they get to know each other and take care of their now-fragile father. Through Glory\u2019s loving and accepting eyes, we get to see a side of Jack that is quite different from the person John Ames sees in \u201cGilead\u201d. I had a few problems with \u201cHome\u201d. Most importantly, Robinson chose to use an third person narrator for this story instead of letting Glory tell it in first person as John Ames did in \u201cGilead\u201d. While the point of view is mostly Glory\u2019s, Robinson lets herself comment on other character\u2019s thoughts and feelings. It seems sloppy, especially when it happens mid-paragraph. It was also strange reading about Jack when I already knew a lot of his story from \u201cGilead\u201d. I knew who Della was and why he hadn\u2019t brought her with him. Knowing what I knew, it made his reactions to certain news stories make sense. However, he never once comes out and tells Glory the information he told John Ames in \u201cGilead\u201d about Della. Glory doesn\u2019t find out until the very end though a very implausible circumstance. It was very, very odd already knowing the story of Jack as \u201cHome\u201d is unfolding. That said, I really don\u2019t think \u201cHome\u201d stands on its own the way \u201cGilead\u201d did. I think if the reader hasn\u2019t read the first novel, there is no way he or she is going to understand what is going on in this one. On the other hand, \u201cGilead\u201d totally spoils \u201cHome\u201d. The whole thing is given away before the reader even picks it up. I also felt that I wanted to know more about Glory and the period between childhood and her return home. We get a bit of her story, but I would have liked it to have been more substantial.I am giving \u201cHome\u201d three stars because it is beautifully written. The imagery is subtle but amazingly well done. I could see the Boughton house, garden and barn so clearly in my mind. The setting really came to life and almost became a character of its own. I liked that we got to see a bit of Lila Ames as a real person instead of an idealized wife and mother. I\u2019m going to end this review with a question that kept coming to my mind. Why did the Boughtons choose Glory as the name for their youngest daughter? The other girls were named Faith, Hope and Grace. In my mind, I kept thinking that the fourth girl should be named Charity, not Glory. I thought Glory was an unusual choice."}, {"userName": "mai ahmd", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7154074-mai-ahmd", "userReview": "\u0643\u0627\u0646

"userReview": "I was disappointed with the muted passions of the characters in the novel and their unrealistic dwelling on spiritual and moral issues in isolation from the wellsprings of the usual ongoing connections and concerns in life. The prose has the same elegant and spare virtues as Robinson\u2019s previous books, \u201cHousekeeping\u201d and \u201cGilead\u201d, but the narrative often dragged to me due to excessive length relative to few substantive events and choices in action taken by the characters. In the late 50\u2019s, a dutiful middle-aged daughter, Glory, leaves her teaching job to returns to rural Gilead, Iowa, to take care of her frail elderly father, a saint-like pillar of the community he served as a Presbytarian minister. They are joined by an extended visit of the prodigal oldest son, Jack, who was a troublemaker in his youth and has been a source of worry while out of touch for nearly two decades. Outwardly, Christian kindness, forgiveness, and hope for redemption abounds in all their interactions, yet each of the three struggle with their largely hidden senses of guilt over past failures and inadequacies in their current roles in life. As the characters move toward a better understanding of each other, the reader is faced with a claustrophobia inducing sense of isolation. Aside from regular interactions of daily home life, there is little impingement of the outside world for most of the novel. When Jack and Glory refer to their past lives, no names or places are revealed. A TV is acquired, providing and small window of discussion about the ongoing conflicts of the Civil Rights movement. A rhythm of home life is marked by Jack regularly working on an old car and he and Glory tending daily to the garden. No one fights or displays strong emotions when they are together. No serious medical illnesses of the father calls for dramatic efforts in his care. There is beauty in this innovative model for exploring the meaning of \u201chome\u201d and exploration of whether adults can truly return to it. But the story almost leans toward the absurdist minimalism of \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d or to the philosophical setting of Plato\u2019s Cave. But for me I need more realism or more content in the story to reap full pleasures of the resonance between the universal and particulars of life."}, {"userName": "J.

When one reads good literature, for instance, Cormac McCarthy, one is often struck by a turn of phrase or a passage. \"How aptly and poetically written,\" one thinks. This happens rarely with Robinson, because her prose lead us perfectly into the characters' lives. So it is only in hindsight that one identifies her prose as beautiful, and this only because one thinks of the story itself as true in the sense that truth causes one to feel lifted out of oneself. In \"Home\", Robinson combines the best of \"Housekeeping\" and \"Gilead\". On one hand, she describes with her characteristically oblique poignancy the life of the outcast. On the other she describes the long good life of faith with its struggles and its blessings. However, this book is not the same as \"Giliead\", in which faith was is painted much more darkly here than in \"Gilead\". Jack, the black sheep of Pastor Boughton's eight children, returns to visit his father in his old age. His father has a hard time seeing Jack again, whom he loves deeply, but who is still an occasional drunk, among other things. Jack's little sister is also home, tending to her father in her dottage. Jack is wary of them both, expecting their accusations. The father, Boughton, recieves his son with joy. However, as the book wears on, there is question about whether or not he has the strength to love his prodigal son. He summons Jack to his room to reprimand him for sins imagined and remembered, despite the great pain these talks give Jack. The character of Jack is memorable, he stands with a slouching elegance and has an irony and humor in all he says, like one long accustomed to failure and judgment. Boughton reminds me of what I know of a religious parent's strong drive to see their child go on the narrow path. The well meaning, and capacity for forgiveness do not lessen the force of displeasure, but rather give it weight. The judgement of a fool, or a bad man, or an enemy is unimportant. But the displeasure of a good, loving and even forgiving father is an almost unshakeable weight. Glory, the little sister, is however, taken with her brother. She remembers his humor, his wistful disposition, and the rarity of his presence from when she was growing up. He however suspects her of being ready with condemnation for his life, and it is only through her sustained effort at kindness that they become friends. She is ultimately the one that recieves a few confidences from Jack, and is able to give him some small comfort. One cannot call this story happy. If there is a common thematic thread in Marilynne Robinson's novels, it is the deep pain that people carry beneath their surfaces, and need for gentleness, forgiveness, and sustained compassion. This does not end the suffering that the world gives people, but it makes it, perhaps, bearable. This is the stuff to smoke."}, {"userName": "Sohaib", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib", "userReview": "A wonderful read! Home is about family, love, life and second chances. I really enjoyed Glory\u2019s account of what happens throughout the novel, although at one point I was tempted to question the reality of what she thinks or wonder about how other characters perceive the same incidents. Her narrative, however, is remarkable, cautious and meticulous when it comes to her brother and father, adding to the familial intensity (this is called a third person limited narrator if you are wondering and I guess Robinson intentionally wrote it this way to fit this book dialogically into the trilogy). I only read Housekeeping for Robinson by the way.The overarching theme in Home is God\u2019s Providence and how our conscious perception is always hindered by what we do not know or cannot understand. Our judgments and perception of others are often skewed because of our unconscious attachment to our subjective experiences and what we do not know. After all, we can only have our own experience to give, measure and judge other people and experiences upon. It would be interesting to read Lila and Gilead; to complete the trilogy and the characters view on things \u2013 to completely understand the dialogicity of the three novels.Putting Housekeeping and Home side by side, the two are postmodern narratives, optimistic and vivacious. Housekeeping focuses on the initiation phase and getting the journey going, the journey of transience for Ruth and Sylvie. Home focuses on the return phase, the phase where all the doing is done, where the journey is about to end and the characters have been through all the battles and have the scars to show for it now (think why Jack\u2019s scar under his eye keeps popping up in the novel). It is interesting how Robinson shifts the traditional focus of most narratives, given that we view every novel in the journey motif frame. Home foregrounds what happens (or what does not happen) in the most inactive phase, the return phase. Jack\u2019s transformation has already happened after he returns back home, but all the tension ensues because of the characters\u2019 failure to understand this (even Jack himself) \u2026All in all, Home is a wonderful read! Can\u2019t wait to get my hands on Gilead and Lila, especially Lila because of the narrator\u2019s transient background, which is reminiscent of a some kind of sequel for Housekeeping\u2019s Ruth and Sylvie.\nThis review is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."}, {"userName": "Come Musica", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30263562-come-musica", "userReview": "\u00c8 di una delicatezza estrema.Tutti sognano di avere un posto, dove poter tornare e chiamare casa.Eppure ci sono case che sembrano un esilio.La storia di due fratelli, due punti neri che si distinguono in una famiglia che \u00e8 un foglio bianco immacolato.Un legame forte che va oltre le colpe personali di ciascuno, per abbracciarsi nell'amore che non giudica e che sa andare oltre.Quell'amore capace del perdono che solo Glory sa concedere a Jack.N\u00e9 il padre, n\u00e9 il reverendo Ames, n\u00e9 altri.Solo Glory, ma non \u00e8 abbastanza per Jack.Bellissimo."}, {"userName": "Mariafrancesca di natura viperesca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9512106-mariafrancesca-di-natura-viperesca", "userReview": "Suppergi\u00f9 scrissi nel 2013 su \u201cCasa\u201d, primo libro della Robinson letto:scrittura \u201cenorme\u201d, denso come un nocciolo di uranio.Infatti, pur limitato dall\u2019orizzonte del pi\u00f9 sperduto dei paesini del middle west statunitense, contiene i germi dell\u2019universalit\u00e0 del dolore come dice Marilynne Robinson in un\u2019intervista di Fabio Donalisio, uscita su \u00abBlow Up\u00bb. Due fratelli Glory e Jack, ritornati a casa sconfitti dalla vita, vivono la sconfitta ognuno a suo modo: lei con tristezza e nostalgia per quei sogni mai concretizzati, lui oppresso dai sensi di colpa e dal senso d\u2019indegnit\u00e0 di non riuscire a liberarsi dal vizio che gli ha fatto scendere i gradini dell\u2019abiezione sociale fino al carcere, dove aveva attentamente studiato la bibbia per trovare risposte per s\u00e9 e per il padre. E in questa casa vive solo il vecchio padre, pastore presbiteriano, che non si da pace per l\u2019amatissimo figlio il cui ritorno ricalca quello del figliol prodigo, senza per\u00f2 la gioia e il perdono incondizionato del passo biblico, tormentato com\u2019\u00e8, il vecchio, dal suo non potersi adeguare a ci\u00f2 che ha predicato tutta la vita: il mistero della predestinazione. Che importanza pu\u00f2 avere se Jack non si \u00e8 comportato bene, non ha ricalcato le orme paterne, visto che non c'\u00e8 certezza sulle modalit\u00e0 di salvezza? E le scritture non insegnano  \"che siamo tutti peccatori e dobbiamo perdonarci ed essere clementi l\u2019uno con l\u2019altro?\". Ma Dio, l\u2019altro protagonista di questa storia, pur non essendo il dio punitore dell\u2019antico testamento non \u00e8 nemmeno quello che ti viene incontro a confortare e perdonare le debolezze. E\u2019 piuttosto un dio osservatore immobile, impotente, dolente che non aiuta il pastore presbiteriano dilaniato tra predestinazione-perdono e mancanza di volont\u00e0-punizione. Glory lenisce il dolore e la sconfitta nella cura del padre e del fratello che, come ha intuito, sorveglia discretamente per non farlo ricadere nel vizio del bere. Si dedica alle piccole cose quotidiane, alla preparazione di cibi che possano piacere al dolente padre e all\u2019infelice fratello. Jack, il ribelle, si aggira come un estraneo nella casa paterna che non ha sentito mai sua; ma ne rinnova il giardino curato una volta dalla madre e ridipinge le sedie Arindock come se il passato fosse stato solo un brutto sogno. Sullo sfondo le lotte razziali degli anni \u201950, Martin Luther King e la grettezza di una cittadina di provincia, che non smette la diffidenza verso il ladruncolo che fu Jack da ragazzino e che non pu\u00f2 essere cambiato. E verso la fine svela alla sorella la grande storia d\u2019amore con una ragazza di colore, Della, e del figlio traditi un\u2019ennesima volta con l\u2019odiata bottiglia di gin. Lui, affetto da \u201cuna determinazione esitante, resosi ridicolo con un tentato suicidio, se ne va perch\u00e9 quella non \u00e8 la sua casa. Poco prima di levar le tende, alla sorella appariva  \"pervaso da una tranquillit\u00e0 dovuta alla rassegnazione\" al proprio vizio, sua rovina.E Glory? Come tutte le donne, o almeno un buon numero di esse, non si rassegna ma si adatta traendo dalle piccole cose uno scopo per continuare a vivere: chieder\u00e0 di insegnare nella scuola di Gilead, l\u2019ultimo pensiero che avrebbe avuto al mondo.E tutto questo viene trasmesso da una scrittura fatta dialoghi e riflessioni dei personaggi di cui la Robinson si fa mediatrice.

Last week, I read Roxana Robinson's Cost and mentioned in my review that although it was a heavy melodrama, it would not make you cry. Since that and this book, Marilynne Robinson's Home are both included in the 1001 list and the two lady authors share the same surname (Robinson - although no relation), I read them with only a book in between.This is about relationships all anchored in a place we call HOME. Yes, the novel is aptly titled (unlike in Cost which up to now, I am not sure why it was titled that way). It's about enduring friendships between two men in cloth, i.e., Presbyterian priests. Mrs. Robinson has only written 3 novels in the span of 30 years and all those novels are award-winning. The second novel, Gilead, is about a preacher, Reverend Ames, who has a secondary role in this 3rd novel, Home. However, his friendship with this novel's main character, Reverend Robert Boughton is something that seems to be rare nowadays. It is a friendship that is true, loyal and is based on their deep faith in God. It is also about the relationship between siblings. Reverend Boughton and his wife (already deceased), had 8 all grownup children. In the story, all of them were mentioned and described but only 3 were active characters. These were Jack, the 45-y/o \"black sheep\" of the family, Glory, the 38-y/o youngest child who was ditched by her married lover and Teddy, the 43-y/o doctor who was the brightest in the family. The storytelling of Mrs. Robinson is so pure and lucid that you will hang on to each of her word and keep on turning each page as you are mesmerized with her beautiful prose. For me, what made her different from all the contemporary authors I've so far read is the way she builds her climax. If you are the reader who wants action in every page, this is not the book for you. There are no big dramatic dialogues, no earth-shaking events, no historical backdrop but you keep on turning the page because you always have that feeling that at any point, something big will come up. It's like there is a dagger that is lurking above the characters despite all of them being gentle, polite and kind to each other. Almost everything happened in their old family house located in a fictional town of Gilead in Iowa sometime in the 50's when life was a lot simpler and houses in heartland USA were still all surrounded by trees, garden and with a porch and a barn. The type that you see in the movies set in that era.Above all, this is about HOME. Ye, who are weary, come home says Glory to Jack at their farewell scene. That part that made me cry this morning. It was my fault. When reading a sentimental novel and I know I was nearing the climax, I play a mood music. You know what? All the characters in this book are cry babies. So, why not join the fun, I told myself. Just like in the movies the soundtrack can enhance the scene. This morning, I played the album \"Classical Heartbreakers\" and when I was on the last 20 pages, I was already one of the characters - tears swelling in my eyes. Read this. Reminisce the time that you were young and living with your parents and siblings. If you are not in this kind of family drama, just keep on reading and in the last 20 pages, I know you will cry. You will."}, {"userName": "Jana", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana", "userReview": "This book is one the quietest books I've ever read. Just give yourself time...In the beginning I didn\u2019t know what is going to happen, is it going to happen' at all. Everything was so slow and calm and subtle, main characters kept everything inside. They were hidden and undiscovered. Every inner monologue was complicatedly layered and deep while every verbal dialogue was poor and in the shadow. They were too scared to talk about what they were thinking, what actually was haunting them and initially that left me a bit anxious. But, nothing negatively anxious, because underneath - they just don\u2019t burst and explode. They are just not that kind of people. In the beginning I was the problem - I realise that now since in this hyped world I rarely find oasis. And this book, oh beauty, this book \u2013 elated me to a place where kindness, gracefulness and forgiveness live. Redemption is the main troubled theme. Imperfection of our kind and how we are silently touched by vows of unconditional love that tie and suffocate us, as much as they let us live. People in this book need quiet space and quiet time to lick their wounds, to heal and to prove themselves again. To find themselves worthy. And where else are you gonna come if not home when you need to hide yourself from the world. Where else will you stare at the white walls and find your heartbeat steadying. It's a meditation on values. Even if you can\u2019t mend your demons and even if you can\u2019t change things, even if you try all your life. I so immensely love Robinson's suffering style. It's difficult, it's so profound and in many ways heartbreakingly beautiful because grace, peace and wonder of this book will touch you and change you. This whole eloquent idea of their painful need for forgiveness and compassion is why I kept reading it. I enjoyed and I adore this book so much.

It's both incredibly humane and generous toward its characters, and at the same time ruthless in exposing the limitations they face as they live out what they believe they know are their allotted roles (without quite understanding why), try as they might to break out of them."}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "Marilynne Robinson's mournful new novel, Home, is not a sequel or a prequel to her Pulitzer Prize-winning Gilead (2004) but rather a companion. And companionship, it turns out, is what all the lonely people in this book are seeking. Set in the same Iowa town, just a short distance from Rev. John Ames, the dying narrator of Gilead, the events in Home take place concurrently with those of that other novel. This time, however, we're in the house of Rev. Robert Boughton, Ames's longtime friend, who's equally close to putting on \"imperishability.\"The publisher claims these two novels can be read separately, but that's not fair to the profound relationship between them nor, I think, to the way Home depends on its predecessor for detail and resonance. Indeed, as meditative and spare as Gilead is, it now seems downright hyperactive next to this ruminative new volume. Rev. Ames, you will recall, spiced his reflections on life and God with wild tales of his one-eyed grandfather, who rode with the abolition terrorist John Brown. There are deadly adventures in Home, too, but they take place offstage, and they're never mentioned, only outlined by the pained silence of those who cannot forget.Almost all the physical movement of this story is exhausted in its opening pages with the return of Glory, the youngest of Boughton's eight children. Robinson writes in the third person, but we see the events that unfold over the following months in 1950 from Glory's point of view. Her father is overjoyed to see her, and neither of them mentions the collapsed engagement and abandoned career that have brought her back to live in her childhood house at the age of 38. \"Nothing about that house ever did change,\" she thinks, \"except to fade or scar or wear.\" Now, forced to abandon dreams of a husband and a child of her own, she's haunted by the question, \"What does it mean to come home?\" With so much nursing and housekeeping to be done, both of them can pretend that Glory has returned entirely for her father's sake. \"She did not permit herself to brood, strong as the urge was sometimes,\" Robinson writes. \"She could decide nothing about her life. She did not want to think about her life.\"Their quiet routine is soon interrupted by the return of another wayward Boughton child. The black sheep in this otherwise happy family, Jack was a petty thief and a brooding drunk who skipped town 20 years before, leaving behind his teenage girlfriend, a baby and a cloud of shame. During the intervening years, Jack continued to torture his parents by spurning every offer of assistance no matter how desperate his circumstances. When he finally returns -- thin, pale, unkempt -- Glory barely recognizes him. Though she once idolized him, now he seems to her \"the weight on the family's heart, the unnamed absence, like the hero in a melancholy tale.\" But their father -- a man of \"tireless tenderness\" -- is giddy, thrilled by the possibility that his boundless love may finally open the heart of his wary, rueful child.This is a version of the Prodigal Son that picks up where the Gospel parable stops, after the extravagant feast, when the excitement of reunion fades in the awkwardness of the next day, and then the next. Robinson has constructed a plot so still that it seems at times more a series of tableaux than a novel. The tension in Home is palpable but invisible. Rev. Boughton, Glory and Jack move through domestic chores and hesitant conversations, fraught with the danger of confession or rapprochement or affection. Glory and her father are determined to make their love known to Jack, but the possibility of his bolting again renders them all timid and formal. \"They had always been so careful of him,\" Robinson writes, \"almost afraid to touch him. There was an aloofness about him more thoroughgoing than modesty or reticence. It was feral, and fragile.\"Jack is a man in the throes of a spiritual crisis, which Robinson captures with the most exquisite precision. An alcoholic clutching at the edges of sobriety, he's tempted to think he can clean himself up, but he's desperately afraid of failing, knowing that one more slip could kill both him and his long suffering father. With a mixture of affection, embarrassment and annoyance, he realizes that his father is \"afraid to die because of me. To leave me behind, still unregenerate.\"Writing one novel about a minister's family is asking for trouble; writing a second seems downright unrepentant, the kind of misjudgment that could land a reputable literary author in a Christian bookstore or with a cozy series on the BBC. But Robinson, who teaches at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, is unlikely to suffer either fate; her books are toxic to sentimentality. Even more than their stylistic beauty, what's miraculous about Gilead and Home is their explicit focus on spiritual affliction, discussed in the hard terms of Protestant theology. Robinson uses the words \"grace,\" \"salvation\" and \"prayer\" frequently and without embarrassment and without drifting into the gassy lingo of ecumenical spirituality. Her characters cower in the shadow of perdition.Though as a teenager Jack seemed to have paid no attention to his father's sermons, now, amid the ruins of his adult life, he's hypnotized by a sense of his worthlessness even as he feels \"a certain spiritual hunger.\" Why, he wonders, could he never be a part of this wonderful family? What has drawn him again and again to hurt them and himself? \"I don't really know what to do with myself,\" he tells Glory. \"I'm a scoundrel.\"As a disquisition on the agonies of family love and serial disappointment, Home is sometimes too illuminating to bear. During a long, candid conversation that serves as the crisis of the novel, Jack's father confesses, \"So many times, over the years, I've tried not to love you so much. I never got anywhere with it, but I tried.\" And then he manages to ask, without rancor of any kind, \"What I'd like to know, is why you didn't love us. That is what has always mystified me.\"Although there's much sadness here, it's always cradled in Robinson's voice. \"This life on earth is a strange business,\" she writes, but somehow that business sounds like a more familiar home in these discerning pages.Originally published in The Washington Post:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/..."}], "description": "Home parallels the story told in Robinson's Pulitzer Prize-winning Gilead. It is a moving and healing book about families, family secrets, and the passing of the generations, about love and death and faith.Hundreds of thousands were enthralled by the luminous voice of John Ames in Gilead Marilynne Robinson\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novel. Home is an entirely independent, deeply affecting novel that takes place concurrently in the same locale, this time in the household of Reverend Robert Boughton, Ames\u2019s closest friend. Glory Boughton, aged thirty-eight, has returned to Gilead to care for her dying father. Soon her brother, Jack\u2014the prodigal son of the family, gone for twenty years\u2014comes home too, looking for refuge and trying to make peace with a past littered with tormenting trouble and pain. Jack is one of the great characters in recent literature. A bad boy from childhood, an alcoholic who cannot hold a job, he is perpetually at odds with his surroundings and with his traditionalist father, though he remains Boughton\u2019s most beloved child. Brilliant, lovable, and wayward, Jack forges an intense bond with Glory and engages painfully with Ames, his godfather and namesake. Home is a moving and healing book about families, family secrets, and the passing of the generations, about love and death and faith. It is Robinson\u2019s greatest work, an unforgettable embodiment of the deepest and most universal emotions.", "title": "Home\n      \n          (Gilead #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2924318-home", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426188598l/2924318.jpg", "reviews": 2790, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7491.Marilynne_Robinson", "name": "Marilynne Robinson"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Novels", "Historical", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2924318-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8216909-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6550115-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6097133-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13455865", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13502987-en-casa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16052163", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14625371-casa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68210.Gilead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11741.Housekeeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20575411-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12095063-when-i-was-a-child-i-read-books", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114809.The_Death_of_Adam", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
