She is able to intensify the mythic core of each of these tales, not by stripping them down to their essentials (the obvious way) but by using eccentric, illuminative detail expressed in individualistic prose. Although these versions could be described as feminist and anti-patriarchal, such labels are too limiting for the fierce independence of Carter's intelligence. She is a writer who never shrinks from acknowledging the transformative power of sexual passion--even if the object of that passion be unworthy or evil, even if the passion itself be dark and destructive. It is her frankness, her clarity and her art--not the adherence to any philosophical position--that make these tales so liberating, so powerful, such flawless examples of craftsmanship and style."}, {"userName": "Amalia Gavea", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56789747-amalia-gavea", "userReview": "\"My father lost me to The Beast at cards.\"\nA recent discussion with Konstantin-one of my best friends in Goodreads- prompted me to read this collection a little sooner than I had planned. And it was an utterly fascinating experience. I knew I was going to love it and my expectations were justifiably high. 10 exceptional short stories paying homage to classic fairy tales and especially to Charles Perrault. From ''Bluebeard'' and ''The Beauty and the Beast'' to ''Puss -in- Boots'' and ''The Snow Child'' written in a unique, sensual, dark language.\nThe Bloody Chamber\n :In my opinion, the jewel of the collection. This is a story based on \"Bluebeard\", one of my favourite fairy tales because I'm weird and I like it:) Seriously, though, this is a beautiful showcase of Carter's immense talent. She inserts elements from the dawning of Gothic Fiction and crafts a perfect story. The legend of Dracula, Carmilla, the Iron Maiden. As a young woman, who finds herself amidst the journey of marriage to a strange count, discovers sexual liberation, perversion and death. I loved the language in this one, full of underlying sensuality and the blurred line between pleasure and despair.\nThe Courtship of Mr Lyon \n : A story based on \"Beauty and the Beast\". Carter kept the most well known features of the tale intact. Sometimes, the best retellings are the ones that stay close to the original source and this was definitely the case here. \nThe Tiger's Bride\n : The second story based on \"Beauty and the Beast\". A young woman of aristocratic origin travels from Russia to Italy. The Beast becomes a tiger in a tale full of weird twists that make the ending shocking and powerful. Carter shows that finding your identity is essential for both sexes and the descriptions are poetic and vivid. A story of winter and spring...\nPuss-in-Boots \n : A tale based on the story by Giovanni Francesco Straparola. \"Puss in Boots\" had never been among my favourite fairy tales but Carter manages to combine it with Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia and Figaro is turned into a genius, cynic and all-around spectacular feline. An entertaining story that reads like a true opera buffa.\nThe Erl-King\n : Reminiscent of Goethe, the Grimm brothers and the legend of the King of Fairies in Scandinavian folklore. The tale starts with a beautiful description of an autumnal forest, haunting and colourful, full of smells and visions. It is the most sexually charged tale of the collection with beautiful erotic descriptions and a constant battle between innocence and awareness. Love isn't a blinding force in this story. The maiden doesn't saintly surrender to her fate. She changes it and prevails.\nThe Snow Child\n : There are many versions of this fairy tale. Carter chooses the most shocking, violent, dark variant, a twisted vision of a tormented Snow White. It is a short tale that strikes at the heart with its dark themes of necrophilia, abuse and lethal jealousy.\nThe Lady of the House of Love :\n \n\"A girl who is both death and the maiden.\"\n Carter combines the tale of \"The Sleeping Beauty\", the legend of Elizabeth Bathory and the tale of Dracula to create a story set in the Carpathian region during the turn of the previous century that is nothing short of a masterpiece.\nThe Werewolf :\n It makes me sad that in our current times, books of dubious (to put it mildly) quality have transformed such haunting and fascinating creatures into a fad of a horrible pop culture. Thankfully, writers like Carter do not refuse them the position that centuries of lore have granted to these tortured creatures of the night. A tale based on \"Little Red Riding Hood\", enriched with folklore from Walpurgisnacht and with an interesting heroine of dubious motives.\nThe Company of Wolves\n \n\"The wolfsong is the sound of the rending you will suffer, in itself a murdering.\" \n A second story based on \"Little Red Riding Hood\". The wolf is the protagonist. The beauty, the agility, the danger. Carter makes use of the legends and fables about the werewolf juxtaposed with the innocence of the children and the allure of the forbidden. A story that is open to many interpretations...\nWolf-Alice\n This is the third story based on \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and the one fully demonstrating society's obsession to have us all the same, denying us the right to be what we want to be. A young woman defies religious and social rules and discovers that compassion and companionship are sometimes waiting where we least expect them.The stories are rich in visual scenes, faithful to the spirit of their original sources and composed of themes that are difficult and demanding. Carter speaks of female emancipation, sexual liberation, the heavy chains of patriarchy and society's expectations of women. Carter defies the stereotypes and clearly demonstrates the desire for the identity of the heroine who saves herself instead of waiting for the Knight. Even when she falters, it's by her own choice and she accepts the consequences. What are the canonical fairy tales, in any case? Didactic parables of the notion that \"transgressions\" turn people into monsters. Anything that doesn't meet the common expectations of appearance and behavior is considered demonic. But we, as women, don't need to read tales to discover there are monsters in the world. We've seen them. We have been facing them for centuries. We still fight against them. We always will...It is my sincerest conviction that fairy tales, especially retellings such as these, can reveal more about the human nature than any \"serious\" novel or philosophical work. Carter's tales couldn't have been more meaningful, more relevant to our current times, mirroring issues that concern us constantly. That is if we are willing to look deeper and search for them. These tales are written in beautiful language but this is merely a \"technical\" issue. What matters is what they try to tell us and show us. This is beyond labels such as \"Horror\" or \"Gothic\" or \"Literary Fiction\". It is about ourselves and our identities.\n\"The lamb must learn to run with the tigers\"\nMy reviews can also be found on https://theopinionatedreaderblog.word..."}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "Halloween re-read!\nAngela Carter is an absolute masterful writer. She takes the basic narrative of fairy tales and infuses them will blood, death and horror. She\u2019s a genius at what she does.She\u2019s a great story-teller. She transports the stories to the confines of modern society and considers real issues such as the representation of women, the limitations of gender and the restrictions of stories themselves.Her prose is captivating, near on enchanting. As soon as I began reading the first story in here, I was hooked on her style. She reminds me of Margaret Attwood. The two have a way of presenting such issues in a remarkably frank way, and better yet the stories themselves, the actual plot rather than the allegories, are immensely entertaining. This is the kind of literature I love: a suspense filled vessel of storytelling that is full of dark meanings. She\u2019s a drastically under read writer when you consider her creative talent. I couldn\u2019t recommend her work more highly, especially today."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2927182-ellen", "userReview": "Hey there Little Red Riding Hood,You sure are looking good.You\u2019re everything a big bad wolf could want.Listen to me\u2026I don\u2019t think little big girls shouldGo walking in these spooky old woods alone. \u2014Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, 1962In The Bloody Chamber, Angela Carter\u2019s uses a decidedly feminist slant to re-tell familiar myths and stories. \u201cThe Company of Wolves,\u201d for example, provides a point-by-point rebuttal of the myths embedded in the more modern versions of \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood.\u201d Interestingly, the earliest versions of the fairy tale were primarily oral and far more risqu\u00e9. These versions included sexual elements such as the wolf (actually a \u201cwerewolf\u201d in the oldest versions) telling Red Riding Hood to throw her clothes, one by one, into a fire (Leeming and Sader 391). Further\u2014in these early versions\u2014Red Riding Hood tricks the wolf by pretending that she needs to go outside to relieve herself. Once outside, Red Riding Hood quickly removes the rope attached to her, ties it to a tree, and escapes (Bushi). In these original versions, Red Riding Hood outwits the fox, and the sexual overtones are explicit. By the time Charles Perrault wrote his version in 1697, the story had been sanitized into a lesson on young girls\u2019 morality. In Perrault\u2019s version, the story serves to warn young girls about the threat men pose to their sexual innocence, but does not include the mother\u2019s warning to \u201cstay on the path,\u201d that appears in most later versions (such as that of Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm in 1812). Instead, Perrault ends his tale with an overt moral warning: Young ladies\u2014in particular, well-bred and attractive young ladies\u2014should not be beguiled by men\u2019s wolfish charm (3). Jacob and Wilhelm Grimms\u2019 version [originally called \u201cLittle Red-Cap\u201d:], far more familiar to American and English audiences than that of Perrault, casts Little Red Riding Hood as a younger girl (i.e., even more vulnerable) and begins with the famous warning: \u201c[W:]alk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path.\u201d Predictably, Little Red Riding Hood forgets her mother\u2019s warning, strays off the path, and gets \u201cdeeper and deeper into the wood.\u201d Once in the woods, Little Red Riding Hood\u2019s troubles begin. Ultimately, a hunter, who just happens to be passing by, saves her.Of most significance is the decided shift the fairy tale has undergone through time. In the original versions, Little Red Riding Hood saves herself and is never gulled by the wolf. In versions dating from the seventeenth century onward, the girl strays from the path, actually believes the wolf might really be granny, and is saved by a huntsman. Further, in the Grimms\u2019 version and its modern variations, Red Riding Hood\u2019s comment at the end of the story demonstrates that she has learned her lesson: \u201cAs long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\u201d However, the fairy tale\u2019s other messages to young women are more embedded and more destructive: We are easily distracted and disobedient; we are not safe alone in the woods (traveling off the beaten path); we are fairly stupid; we get ourselves in trouble; and we need to be rescued by a man. In contrast, Angela Carter\u2019s short story, \u201cThe Company of Wolves,\u201d restores the tale\u2019s original elements\u2014such as the overt sexuality and a heroine who is resourceful rather than helpless\u2014but adds a feminist perspective. Carter\u2019s heroine is \u201cstrong-minded,\u201d packs a carving knife in her basket of goodies, and is powerful because of her virginity: \u201cShe stands and moves within the invisible pentacle of her own virginity. She is an unbroken egg; she is a sealed vessel; she has inside her a magic space\u2026she is a closed system; she does not know how to shiver. She has her knife and she is afraid of nothing.\u201d Further, in Carter\u2019s version, Red Riding Hood does not just protect herself, but controls the \u201cgame.\u201d The seduction scene plays out like a modern slasher movie. As the girl\u2014at the wolf\u2019s bidding\u2014removes each item of clothing and ostensibly becomes more and more vulnerable, we begin to see her as a victim. Just as we become lulled by the predictable script in motion, the girl, now completely naked, responds to the wolf\u2019s threat, \u201cAll the better to eat you with,\u201d by bursting into laughter: \u201c[S:]he knew she was nobody\u2019s meat.\u201d Even given the background Carter provides in the story\u2019s beginning, the scene startles. We knew the girl was strong, independent, and armed. However, the pattern of woman-alone-traveling-alone-helpless-alone-victim is so embedded in our consciousness that we are caught off-guard. And, that is precisely Carter\u2019s point.Adapted from a prior publication"}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily",

deceptive pop-culture whitewash, all blood-splattered and primal and sensual and lady-teachy. I don't know which rose pricked me deeper; the blood countess stricken with sudden, self-sacrificial hideousness in the eternal sleep of light-of-day at finding a pure, deserving specimen of love, \"dropped off to sleep over the cards of destiny that are so fingered, so soiled, so worn by constant shuffling that you can no longer make the image out on any single one of them\"; the image of the haggard yet severe mother riding up all floppy hat and sagely, wild gray hairs, pistol drawn to pierce the not-Bluebeard, not-Gilles de Rais (who cleverly keeps a copy of La-Bas right next to the snuff photography in his bedchamber, because meta-fic) just before he dares attempt to behead her darling, too-curious daughter - an image which anyone with as fierce, protective, supportive, and profoundly independent a mamabear as mine can relate to ad infinitum; the girl who became the tiger for the tiger, full acceptance, literally stripped bare to reveal her [anything, everything]. Beautiful, bombastic prose reclaiming these shadows of childhood for what they were intended to be: lessons about what's to come in burgeoning adulthood, subconscious fears embraced, the ways of the ugly world and its horrid beauty. What a mind. Don't feed your children Disney, feed them this.

For the most part, I didn't feel that was true. Having a few heroines with sexual agency didn't magically make them feminist or ground breaking, it takes a lot more than that to modernise a fairy tale. There were only a couple of them that I actually found somewhat enjoyable, the rest were rubbish.Hated the writing, it was convoluted, complicated, and nonsensical. There were a number of times I got lost as to what the hell was going on and had to keep re-reading sentences over and over to get some clarity. Also, some sentences read more like paragraphs than sentences, they never bloody ended. The stories:THE BLOODY CHAMBER.Quite liked this, but mostly because of the ending where the heroine's mum kills Bluebeard and saves her daughter from death. Other than that it was a paint by numbers retelling of Bluebeard. THE COURTSHIP OF MR LYON. So predictable and cheesy. It was a run of the mill Beauty and the Beast retelling complete with flat characters, insta-love, and zero depth. THE TIGER'S BRIDE. Another Beauty and the Beast retelling. This time Beauty ends up with the Beast because her dad gambles her off like property. At the end Beauty turns herself into a beast too so she can be with a guy who forced her to live with him just so he could see her naked. Ugh.PUSS IN BOOTS. A shallow manslut gets his cat (Puss) to hook him up with the rich beautiful virgin he fell in insta-love with after seeing her just the once. Puss does so, and man gets to shag said virgin, who also happens to be married. Puss and the man kill the husband and get to settle down with their virginal women after years of shagging around. Yea, it was just a tropey mess and the female characters were rubbish. THE ERL KING. Only liked the very end of this when the foolish-love-struck heroine plots to save herself and kill the Erl-king, everything else was weird and rubbish. THE SNOW CHILD. The worst story of the lot, a married Count wishes for a girl as white as snow, red as blood, and black as raven. His wish comes true, but his wife is jealous of the magic girl and tries to kill her (instead of helping her), girl gets killed by a rose, and husband rapes her dead body. And the wife seems to be cool with her husband raping dead bodies. Ugh, hated it.THE LADY OF THE HOUSE OF LOVE. This was the most interesting of all the stories. Liked the gothic undertones and how atmospheric it was. But it read more like a paranormal vampire story than a fairy tale. THE WEREWOLF. I didn't like the girl in this happily causing her werewolf granny's death just so she could inherit her house. Where's the feminism in that?THE COMPANY OF WOLVES. Another story with a girl causing her grandma's death, this time so she can sex up a werewolf guy. Ugh, what's with all these female characters being killed by other female characters and dying in horrible ways?WOLF-ALICE.Weird. Girl thinks she's a wolf, then kind of realises she's not, and then she thinks she's a wolf again. Yea, didn't like it.There were only two stories (The Bloody Chamber and The Lady of the House of Love) in the collection that I somewhat enjoyed. The rest were disappointing, they were either predictable or tropey or plain weird (and not in a good way). Also, apart from The Bloody Chamber, I didn't find any of the retellings to be feminist in any way. I don't know why they've been praised for their feminism when there was actually very little feminism in them, if anything they were sexist what with most of the female characters actions being controlled/influenced by men in some way or another. Also, the writing was rubbish."}, {"userName": "Jan-Maat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat", "userReview": "[ he was also partial to sour milk and raw dough, he was an odd creature (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "There's the indulgence of the mind, and there's the pleasure of the senses. One can fill oneself up on the former to the brim, hold firmly to one's breast its lack of ignorance, its sophisticated patterns of thought, its know-how translating into a delightful net of endless know-whens and know-whats and whatever know-wherefore's your precious neurons may desire. There's a unique satisfaction to be had in those sorts of theoretical acrobatics, that complex weave of states of mind that are fully aware and fairly smug about their enlightened existence. But my god, there's also something to be said for the sensual things in life. Revel all you want in the theory of evolution, but don't forget to take advantage of what this millenia long build up of exquisite physicality has gifted you with. A simple thing to do, that last part, wouldn't you think? This book certainly had no trouble with spilling out in a languorously lurid display its myriad charms and carnal glory, many if not all of the stories focused on the well earned pleasures of females taking charge of their own. And yet, look at the society of today, a heterosexually dominated rape culture complete with the most hypocritical set of double standards to ever exist, where every boy is a Casanova and every girl is either an easy slut or a virginal saint. Never both. That's a physical impossibility, didn't you know, since the very word 'virginity' implies that a cock has the power to change the inherent dichotomy of whatever it fucks. Boys can be virgins too, but the lack of it never seemed to compromise their intrinsic value in the history of cultures worldwide. Quite the opposite, in fact. And on the other hand, you get the dowry. Unicorns. Virginal white caked in contextual definitions of simpering innocence and shining perfection, ideological imperatives that soak the fairy tales choked down at the cradle and continue forever on in trash \u00e0 la Fifty Shades of Gray. Spare me this puritanical rot seeping into society, enough to make a biological imperative a sin in some situations and a shameful state in all cases female. Deliver me from erotica that claims to pander to anything besides the patriarchy, and is subsumed by it all the more. Give me a heady mix of whirling words that seduce the senses without sacrificing the self on an altar of supreme obedience and abused devotion, offering pleasure with no sense of whatever guilt the world attempts to infuse it with. Keep your knights in shining armor who think the nub between their legs makes them a god over everything that lacks it. I'll take the man who sees the woman as an equal in all things in the bedroom and without, the woman who will kiss you if you treat her right and spill your throat out in a righteous flow if you treat her otherwise.You have your body. You have your dignity. You know that others have these, and that you must respect them.

Angela Carter made clear, \"My intention was not to do 'versions' or, as the American edition of the book said, horribly, 'adult' fairy tales, but to extract the latent content from the traditional stories and to use it as the beginnings of new stories.\"And she did it using imagery and beautifully poetic and lyrical language to describe inner liberation of social conventions, prejudges and stereotypes that disable us to build strong character, become ourselves and fulfill our potential as women (and men). Carter challenges our views on male and female sexuality, relationships, marriage and traditional roles. In a subtle way, she devours the hypocrisy of traditional male-dominated society view of women as objects, helpless beautiful princesses in submissive passive roles of wives of powerful men. The lead female characters often start as poor, innocent, helpless girls that are bound in some way to man, and in time they become engaged, active, experienced, and adventurous characters. They become not only beauties but also beasts, they too are strong and begin to claim their (sexual) desires. When it comes to sexual liberation it often takes killing an authoritative man (or sacrificing their own virginity) to become fully free (a metaphor for killing the patriarchal stereotypes that society imposters on women). Themes of innocence, virginity, sexuality, and death are ongoing motives in the stories. Society idea of female perfection, \"good, loyal, and submissive\" is a death sentence for female protagonists in the stories. Classic male-female roles are reversed, and we can argue about the idea of masculinity and femininity, as the characters show that to be a complete mature person, you have to be both \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" to live an authentic and fulfilled existence. The femininity is tied up with inexperience and purity, and masculinity with experience and corruption. Sex and sexual desire are the catalysts for the heroine's transformation into a beast. We can discuss the beast component of every character as coming in the touch of deep subconscious driving forces that become more clear and visible to themselves and the world. They had to accept the animal nature in themselves and in each other so that they can be free of the human world with its moral rules and social constructions, and connect to their true self.The sense of freedom is also crucial in these romantic relationships and the loving, caring and satisfying relationships are advocated, where motives are pure and partners connect to each other\u2019s true bare self. \u2018Yet even these relationships it acknowledges are a matter of choice; as Puss expresses by saying, \"your wives, if you need them,\" and \"your husbands, if you want them.\" \u2019The subtle display of society\u2019s issue of putting woman against each other is present in \"The Snow Child\" and \"The Werewolf\", noting that women are often portrayed as they can coexist only as rivals, in envy and competition for male attention (eye roll).I would say that some of the stories deeply affected me and it was very atmospheric and haunting read, reminded me of Poe\u2019s stories which I infinitely adore, but some stories were in my opinion much stronger than others and were for me personally lacing some substance. I think she painted a beautiful picture of some aspects of human nature, but maybe not in a wide and deep enough way for my taste. I did some training in psychoanalysis and Freud gave absolutely remarkable knowledge to psychiatry, but I think that pursuit of pleasure and sexual liberation can only be starting points in the journey of psychological and spiritual maturity, not an ending as this book suggests. Even though the stories touch on a pursuit of power (self-psychology), power over oneself and life is often just a consequence of establishing a romantic relationship or losing virginity and that is something I can't agree with. I would be far more interested in the pursuit of meaning and purpose as I think that is an ultimate empowerment for both women and men.To finish off with hope in Angela Carter\u2019s quote I really admire:\"I really do believe that a fiction absolutely self-conscious of itself as a different form of human experience than reality (that is, not a logbook of events) can help to transform reality itself.\""}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "Bloody fantastic pick for a Halloween read!It's not like we celebrate Halloween in my part of the world, but I am content to make it a custom every year to read something outside of my usual haunts. October is as good a pretext as any when it comes to horror, the younger sibling of fantasy and science-fiction in speculative fiction, at least for me. Angela Carter can be relied upon to transform scary entertainment into an art form, to twist a familiar fairytale into something more substantial, more disturbing and more provocative. And, ah! his castle. The faery solitude of the place; with its turrets of misty blue, its courtyard, its spiked gate, his castle that lay on the very bosom of the sea with seabirds mewing about its attics, the casements opening on to the green and purple, evanescent departures of the ocean, cut off by the tide from land for half a day ... that castle, at home neither on the land nor on the water, a mysterious, amphibious place, contravening the materiality of both earth and the waves, with the melancoly of a mermaiden who perches on her rock and waits, endlessly, for a lover who had drowned far away, long ago. That lovely, sad, sea-siren of a place! Welcome to a Walpurgis Night in a tri-colour scheme : the white of snow, cold and innocent; the black of a raven wing, deadly and merciless; the red of passion, of blood spilled. Having recently finished a \"Sandman\" graphic novel, I see this dance under the moonlight in terms of the anthropomorphic supernatural beings that rule Gaiman's alternate universe : Dream and Desire spinning around Death and Destruction watched from the sidelines by Destiny and Despair, with Delight chuckling from under the table.Are you ready to open the door to the bloody chamber? Wearing an antique bridal gown, the beautiful queen of the vampires sits all alone in her dark, high house under the eyes of the portraits of her demented and atrocious ancestors, each one of whom, through her, projects a baleful posthumous existence; she counts out the Tarot cards, ceaselessly constructing the constellations of possibilities as if the random fall of the cards on the red plush tablecloth before her could precipitate her from her chill, shuttered room into a country of perpetual summer and obliterate the perennial sadness of a girl who is both death and the maiden. Are you ready to explore the twisted paths of the magical forest of your subconscious, where nightmare creatures stand ready to pounce on the unwary traveller? Of all the teeming perils of the night and the forest, ghosts, hobgoblins, ogres that grill babies upon gridirons, witches that fatten their captives in cages for cannibal tables, the wolf is worst for he cannot listen to reason.You are always in danger in the forest, where no people are. Step between the portals of the great pines where the shaggy branches tangle about you, trapping the unwary traveller in nets as if the vegetation itself were in a plot with the wolves who live there, as though the wicked trees go fishing on behalf of their friends - step between the gateposts of the forest with the greatest trepidation and infinite precautions, for if you stray from the path for one instant, the wolves will eat you. They are grey as famine, they are unkind as plague. You may think you already know the stories : here's Snow White, Beauty with her Beast, there Bluebeard, Vampirella and Red Riding Hood, Alice with her looking glass and Figaro / Puss-in-Boots serenading under a balcony. We have all started our literary journey with some of these timeless gems. But what if we take a look at them with our grown up eyes, carrying our no longer innocent baggage of desires and regrets and nightmares?I am so glad I didn't have to read Carter's stories in school, that I am able to appreciate the poetry of her imagery and her daring sense of humor without the pressure to come up with an essay or with a term paper, deconstructing the myths and finding feminist themes in the text. Liberated of such expectations, the journey was first of all one of pure joy and constant wonder. This is why I will try to keep my analytical habits under leash and concentrate on style - on the author's fascination with gothic scenery and decadent morality, so much more interesting that prim sobriety and dry academic studies. Early on, in the title story, there are a couple of references - to Huysmans novel \"Le bas\" and to a vintage erotica album \"The Adventures of Eulalie at the Harem of the Grand Turk\" (1748) - a gatepost warning if you like that \"Here be Monsters'. I knew from previous Carter novels that her dream worlds are both exuberant and corrupted : a true jungle that boils over with life, with passion and with danger: Spilt, glistering milk of moonlight on the frost-crisped grass; on such a night, in moony, metamorphic weather, they say you might easily find him, if you had been foolish enough to venture out late, scuttling along by the churchyard wall with half a juicy torso slung across his back. [...] He is white as leprosy, with scrabbling fingernails, and nothing deters him. If you stuff a corpse with garlic, why, he only slavers at the treat: cadavre provencale. He will use the holy cross as a scratching post and crouch above the font to thirstily lap up the holy water. Since I put up this irreverent quote, I would also like to refute claims that the stories have some revanchist feminist or anti-Christian agenda. What they are is wild and liberating, freeing us from rigid conventions and outdated moral codes, inviting us to accept and embrace the darker side of our nature:  How cruel it is, to keep wild birds in cages!  So what if a few barbed arrows are thrown at the villagers with pitchforks who want to drive the ogre out of his swamp? It's about time somebody fights back against crowd mentality and superstition. Carter does it with a touch of humor that has a place for the supernatural and the scientific in the same story: To ride a bycicle is in itself some protection against superstitious fears, since the bycicle is the product of reason applied to motion. I am not going to give a synopsis for each tale included in the collection. Instead, I am wondering why Carter has chosen these particular fables and not others? what is the link between them? Well, I believe they all deal with a turning point in life : the moment when we leave childhood behind and we decide who or what we are. The moment when Beauty meets the Beast. It could be a young piano player getting sweeped of her feet in a whirwind romance by a rich and hulking business tycoon. Or it coul be a young British officer doing a tour of the Carpathians on bycicle. A walk in the forest to your grandmother house. Or a wild creature (Mowgli, Tarzan, Alice) brought out of the wild to be taught how to be civilized. There's usually a white rose, or a bridal gown, or a world blanketed in pure snow. And then there's the monster, the tiger or the werewolf, the king of the forest or the secretive prince in his high castle. When the two meet, blood will soon follow - sexual awakening, sometimes tender, sometimes brutal, sometimes deadly. He is the tender butcher who showed me how the price of flesh is love; Skin the rabbit, he says! Off come my clothes. What attracts the innocents to the corrupt? I've read all the stories here, and I don't have a clear answer. Probably because the answer is buried in the deepest recess of our instincts, predating civilization by a few geological eras. Probably blood is the price we pay for knowledge when we loose our innocence: He has the special quality of virginity, most and least ambiguous of states: ignorance, yet at the same time, power in potentia, and furthermore, unknowingness, which is not the same as ignorance. also, How did she think, how did she feel, this perennial stranger with her furred thoughts and her primal sentience that existed in a flux of shifting impressions; there are no words to describe the way she negotiated the abyss between her dreams, those wakings strange as her sleepings. Curiosity makes the world go round, pushes it out of stasis and drives away boredom. We fear what waits in the bloody chamber, yet we cannot keep ourselves from opening the door, even when warned beforehand of the danger. ... she could not control an instinctual shudder of fear when she saw him, for a lion is a lion and a man is a man and, though lions are more beautiful by far than we are, yet they belong to a different order of beauty and, besides, they have no respect for us: why should they? Yet wild things have a far more rational fear of us than is ours of them, and some kind of sadness in his agate eyes, that looked almost blind, as if sick of sight, moved her heart. The Beast is waiting for Beauty to step into its lair, to be chained there (in marriage, in what the world expects of her, in carnal pleasure). You have been warned! Erl-King will do you grievous harm.Piercingly, now, there came again the call of the bird, as desolate as if it came from the throat of the last bird left alive. That call, with all the melancholy of the failing year in it, went directly to my heart. Beauty is lost, but in its place arises a new creature, revelling in her shed blood and suddenly strong enough to tame the monster : \"See! sweet and sound she sleeps in granny's bed, between the paws of the tender wolf.\" >><<>><<>><<>><<>><<The only criticism I have for \"The Bloody Chamber\" is that there are no more than ten stories here, some of them only a couple of pages long.

I guess I will round this bitch up star-wise, but it's still only a 2.5 star read for me. What a disappointment. I'm never completely sure how to review collections of short stories. Because I like to review books as a whole and sometimes story collections are unified or have kind of a continuous theme to them, allowing me to review the book as a book and not as a book of stories. However this collection was strange. At times I felt as if different authors had penned several of them. They are so vastly different in theme, in tone, in continuity, voice, dynamics that I feel I need to review each as a separate entity. And since I do what I want, I will. Along with a fabulous quote from each and a gif to express my feelings in ways words simply cannot. So here goes.The Bloody Chamber: 3.5 stars (original source: Bluebeard)\nEvery man must have one secret, even if only one, from his wife.\"\nThis story was very creepy, haunting, and macabre. It was a wonderful way to start off the collection. I admit, I am not at all familiar with the original French Bluebeard tale, but I didn't think that knowledge was necessary anyway. Carter's prose dripped off the page, and I really enjoyed her use of gothic imagery and eerie atmosphere. I found her style a little unusual and tough to take at times, but in hindsight I realize it really didn't bother me in this story as much as some others. My primary criticism is that the ending was very abrupt and shot out of nowhere. It was so jarring that I had to read the ending twice to make sure I didn't miss something. It is noted early on that our narrator is leaving her home and her mother in order to marry and live with her husband in his estate. It is intimated that she and her mother have a very strong but very unusual relationship, but her mother is never more than just a few mysterious sentences thrown together at a time. For most of the book she is written a a figment of a past time, a past life. I found myself wanting to learn more about her and that past life she comes from when BAM! She shows up out of nowhere guns blazing. Almost written in a way that made me feel like her entrance was totally expected. The hints I got from her character before didn't quite jive with the character we are brought face to face with later and the whole thing came off as odd and intrusive. It was too big an entrance with such a small amount of screen time, that I was confused, and longed for a little more meat to her character. It would have helped with understanding AND she seemed like someone I wanted to know more about. Verdict: Creepy and atmospheric with a few flaws.Also, I kept thinking of this:Which wins it a few points.The Courtship of Mr. Lyon: 2 stars (original source: Beauty and the Beast)\nDo not think she had no will of her own; only, she was possessed by a sense of obligation to an unusual degree and, besides, she would gladly have gone to the ends of the earth for her father, whom she loved dearly.\nI enjoyed that Carter reverted to the original French story in which the beast was in the form of a lion. But that may have been the only thing I liked about this story and the only thing that made it (somewhat) different from EVERY OTHER BEAUTY & THE BEAST RETELLING OUT THERE. Of which there are several, I might add. This story was fine. A bit boring. Nothing new. And the ending is exactly what everyone who knows Beauty & the Beast expects. And you know what? It kinda blows. I understand the message of the story. I'm not dumb. I know that it is supposed to be about sacrifice and making tough choices to save and protect those we love, that love is blind, that real love doesn't understand skin color, flaws, physical beauty, conventions. We are supposed to accept that a young girl (who is in essence a slave) falls in love with her captor who is a literal animaland that sacrifice causes everything to just work out in the end. The reward for falling in love with a beast is having that beast turn into a beautiful specimen of a man? Man Belle is a lucky woman. She totally wins. I wish Carter had pulled a Shrek move instead.Verdict: Boring, but gets kudos for reminding me of one of my favorite childhood shows.The Tiger's Bride: 2.5 stars (original source: Beauty and the Beast)\nIt was a world in itself but a dead one, a burned-out planet. I saw The Beast bought solitude, not luxury, with his money.\nSo this one gains points for being way more original than the last story, but loses points for being completely bizarre. At first, I liked the way this tale followed the original but was a darker, more obscure version. And then out of nowhere Carter throws some shock value in for no reason. I hate arbitrary use of sex in stories. It sends the wrong message and just cheapens both the retelling and the original. And the sexy parts were not even sexy. Ew. Not at all. They were icky and obtrusive and did not jive with the rest of the tale. The ending was the best part and was an expected twist. However it could not save it from Verdict: Icky and bizarre sexual references dropped this from a 3.5 to a 2.5Puss in Boots: 2 stars (original source: Puss in Boots)\nSo all cats have a politician's air; we smile and smile and so they think we're villains.\nBut this pussy got old real fast. I have never been the biggest fan of the original Puss in Boots story, but I have to admit I found Puss's narrative voice entertaining here. It was probably the best part of this story for me as the rest fell to pieces rather quickly. I think where this one failed was in Carter's bizarre choices in styling (which unfortunately had a tendency to stain most of the stories in this volume). She constantly shifted perspectives between first and third person and also switched tenses constantly. God did that make for a frustrating read. It was confusing and weird and I kept having to backtrack because certain things made no sense and didn't have a nice flow to them like some of her other stories did. Its strange, what I liked the best up to this point in the collection was Carter's way with words. Her writing style was poetic and beautiful and she seemed to really choose her words carefully to maximize meaning with beauty. But this story was a complete mess. Errors were rampant and the style was choppy and brusque. The shifting of tenses and perspectives caused quite a bit of confusion, and at times I became lost. Also on this list is some icky cat sex (a lot of icky cat sex) which made the bizarro sexy times in the last story seem hot and heavy by comparison.Verdict: I prefer this guyThe Erl-King: 4 stars (original source: Erl-King folklore)\nThe woods enclose. You step between the first trees and then you are no longer in the open air; the wood swallows you up. There is no way through the wood any more, this wood has reverted to its original privacy. Once you are inside it, you must stay there until it lets you out again for there is no clue to guide you through in perfect safety.\nThis one is such a sucker punch to my emotional feels. So beautifully written with gorgeous prose and imagery. It got me in that place that knows that sometimes love is not enough but longs for the fairytale ending. The tension she created between the Erl-King and our narrator is perfect and macabre and raw and real and I felt myself longing for more. This is a really dark and twisty love story. The kind of love story that borders on horror and the kind of love that is a breath away from obsession and chaos. Carter's stylistic flaws are still present in this story, but the imagery and world building and raw emotions of it completely make up for it. One of the best in this collection by far.Verdict: Delightlfully and beautifully dreary and sinister. Kind of like:The Snow Child: 1 star (original source: The Snow Child, maybe a little Snow White as well)\nSo the girl picks a rose; pricks her finger on the thorn; bleeds; screams; falls.\nAnd that's enough said. This story was completely and totally bizarres. And not in a good way.Verdict: Shit.The Lady of the House of Love: 4 stars (original source: Vampirella, maybe a hint of Sleeping Beauty)\nHer voice is filled with distant sonorities, like reverberations in a cave: now you are the place of annihilation, now you e at the place of annihilation. And she is a cave full of echoes, she is a system of repetitions, she is a closed circuit.\nThat's what this story is: Beautiful. Haunting. Macabre. It is the story that I think fits the best with Carter's odd style. It is also very reminiscent of The Erl-King, my favorite up until this point. And I loved this one for all the reasons I loved that one. Her descriptions of the eerily serene lady, her enchanting house, and her ill-fated lovers were so well rendered and exquisite I really got lost in her words and her world. The ending was refreshing and unexpected, and just a little sad.Verdict: Not perfect, but total lasting power.Plus I kept thinking of this:The Werewolf: 5 stars (original source: Little Red Riding Hood)\nIt is a northern country; they have cold weather, they have cold hearts.\nThis story was perfect. And rang in at 2.5 pages. It packed a punch and was very unique. I loved every second of it. It had the perfect about of folktale, the perfect amount of eerie, and the perfect punch of an ending. I loved this take on the Little Red Riding Hood tale, and loved even more, her take on wolves and werewolves. At this point I have realized that Carter's juice is that fine line that exists between love and hate, beauty and obsession, desire and fear. The stories that work are the ones that make me a little uncomfortable and that don't fit nicely with everyone's idea of a fairytale. This story was absolutely glorious. A total gem.Verdict: Bam! A hit.The Company of Wolves: 1.5 stars (original source: Little Red Riding Hood)\nAt night, the eyes of wolves shine like candle flames, yellowish, reddish, but that is because the pupils of their eyes flatten on darkness and catch the light from your lantern to flash it back to you--red for danger; if a wolf's eyes reflect only moonlight, then they gleam a cold and unnatural green, a mineral, a piercing colour. If a benighted traveller spies those luminous, terrible sequins stitched suddenly on the black thickets, then he knows he must run, if fear has not struck him stock-still\nAs completely original as the last wolf tale was, this was quite the opposite. And Carter seems to have gone back to bizzaro-world with all her stylistic weirdness at full mast. And I got to the point where I was just done. Done with re-reading passages that made no sense. Done with obscure motivations that are arbitrary and cumbersome. Done with plotlessness that have been done and done and done some more. This tale had more of a direct and traditional approach to Little Red with a bit of a horror twist. Which I don't need to remind you has been done before. Verdict: predictable, boring, and pretentious with some kickass descriptions of wolves. Just wish there was more Liam Neeson.Wolf-Alice: 2 stars (original source: Little Red Riding Hood and Through the Looking Glass)\nThe damned Duke haunts the graveyard; he believes himself to be both less and more than a man, as if his obscene difference were a sign of grace. During the day, he sleeps. His mirror faithfully reflects his bed but never the meagre shape within the disordered covers.\nI loved the idea of this story, but the execution fell flat. The story of a feral girl raised by wolves and then found, raised, and reared by an enigmatic Duke could have been quite awesome. And it wasn't. Once again, Carter's weird style interjected itself and made me feel unattached and alienated. And at this point, the fucks I had to give amounted to zero.Verdict: potential that never amounted to anything.So, this is like 2.5-3 stars. The stories that were bad were really bad, but there were a few little gems hidden in here. I even think I was a little too generous sometimes with my star ratings for the ones I didn't care for as much. While I appreciate the obscurity and the atmosphere that she was trying to create here, I just wish that there was a little more meat and a little less fat."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "\"The Marquis stood transfixed, utterly dazed, at a loss. It must have been as if he had been watching his beloved Tristan for the twelfth, thirteenth time and Tristan stirred, then leapt from his bier in the last act, announce in a januty aria interposed from Verdi that bygones were bygones, crying over spilt milk did nobody any good and, as for himself, he proposed to live happily ever after. The puppet master, open mouthed, wide eyed, impotent at the last, saw his dolls break free of their strings, abandon the rituals that he had ordained for them since he began and start to live for themselves; the king, aghast, witnesses the revolt of his pawns.\"If there is a \"mission statement\" in this collection of stories by Angela Carter, this is its most clearly crafted iteration. These stories are told as a particularly erudite fairy might, whispering into your head and dancing through your waking and unconscious dreams, pulling out impressions that half given, now entirely created. These stories make one smile to realize once again how porn is for emotional children, and these stories are for adults, who can are prepared to realize the full possibilities of their sexuality, both in the literal sexual sense, and in the figurative sense of gender-related identity, both male and female, though the pieces ostensibly speak to female identity. And then brought back to earth with the impish, shocking voice of a Puck, who reminds us that these tales are very firmly a part of our deliciously dirty, vulgarly presented reality.These stories will be familiar to adults, but only in the most basic sense. The title story is a retelling of Bluebeard, \"The Courtship of Mr Lyon,\" a modern Beauty and the Beast, \"The Lady in the House of Love,\" a creepily morbid Sleeping Beauty, several recreations of Little Red Riding Hood, etc. They are meant to be familiar, they are meant to lull one into a smug sense of knowing, and then slowly, subtly take each piece of that feeling of comfort away. My particular favorites are the title story, \"The Bloody Chamber,\" and the end of the cycle, \"Wolf-Alice\". The Bloody Chamber's indignant statement on a woman's place in fairy tales is very well taken. It makes the point that Bluebeard picked a woman he obviously knew was curious, made the point of making the \"don't press the red button\" argument, and set her up to fail, in order that he could watch Eve Falling and Falling again for some kind of personal, perverse security in his own masculine identity. She is punished for the nature that she was born with, for simply being in the world. The above stated quote comes towards the end of the tale, as the sacrificial Eve and her companions take control of their inexorable fate. \"Wolf Alice,\" is a beautifully, wonderfully sad statement on what it means to be a woman. It describes a little girl raised by wolves, who grows up with absolutely no knowledge of female identity, much less \"human\" identity. (She believes her \"menses,\" are a spell cast by the full moon as it shines down upon her, for example, and why not?) It shows just how socialized the supposed identity of \"woman,\" is, and just what women may be capable of doing if they have no idea what it is they are supposed to be, as well as reminding us again and again how little seperates us from the carnivorous beasts of the forest. Each story has its own message to give, or ambiguous impression to leave (not all of them are meant for words), beyond the obvious feminist power statements. I would highly recommend this trip to a world that, for all we know, is a much closer part of ours thatn we know."}, {"userName": "Karlyflower *The Vampire Ninja, Luminescent Monster & Wendigo Nerd Goddess of Canada (according to The Hulk)*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17243568-karlyflower-the-vampire-ninja-luminescent-monster-wendigo-nerd-godde", "userReview": "Category: A book of short stories.The Bloody Chamber3.5 StarsI am by no means familiar with the story of Bluebeard, so I have no idea how far Carter may have deviated from the traditional story with this short story retelling HOWEVER I found myself getting lost in her lush, descriptive prose within this one. Her language choices may, overall, become a downfall but for this story it was both fitting and quotable. I do wish I had gotten a bit more of a story here, I would love to have read more about the mother character, she sounds truly badass (and we all know my love of badass women!). That night at the opera comes back to me even now \u2026 the white dress; the frail child within it; and the flashing crimson jewels round her throat, bright as arterial blood.The Courtship of Mr. Lyon2 StarsI don\u2019t really have all too much to say about this one; there was some lovely imagery but the story itself was a very standard retelling of The Beauty and The Beast with, perhaps, less of a build-up to the ending than I would have cared for. I never thought I would say that Disney\u2019s version of any fairy tale was more sinister than a different retelling, but in this case it is true. I remember being young and not understanding why the Beast transformed in the end, doesn\u2019t love mean loving someone as they are?! Why does he suddenly become handsome... and wouldn\u2019t Beauty (Belle) be reviled by this switch if she fell in love with him as the Beast?! The mind, it boggles. I suppose love is blind, or whatever...The Tiger\u2019s Bride2.5 StarsThis is another retelling of The Beauty and the Beast and while I liked some elements of it more than the former it still left a vaguely unsatisfying taste in my mouth. I don\u2019t mind when retellings get a little more sexual than their parent fairy tales, however the 'Let\u2019s get nekkid' element of this felt forced and strange. However, I liked the twist at the end and the sometimes oddly chosen but still understandable edge of strength to Beauty here. I also found her bitterness refreshingmy spine was sharp as broken glass.... Belle always seemed far too sweet about her father\u2019s treatment in the Disney version and I enjoyed a detour from that here. Puss\u2013in-boots2 Stars I do NOT enjoy the voice of the narrator (Puss) here, at all. It was distracting and infuriating, in turns, and removed me entirely from the story. Meanwhile the story itself wasn\u2019t all that interesting to begin with so this voice felt forced and overly annoying. The Erl-King3.5 StarsI loved everything about this story right up until the very end (and a jarring and removing pronoun switch that left me flabbergasted). As a nature lover myself I am always drawn to descriptions of same. I found Carter\u2019s language usage for the Erl-King\u2019s forest wonderfully fitting. Personally, I do not really know the root of this story so I cannot speak to that BUT I did find myself lost in the prose here which felt symbiotic with the story she was telling. The Snow Child1 StarSo I read a retelling of The Snow Child earlier this year, and if you will listen to my advice, you should just go ahead and read that one (The Snow Child) because this short is just going for shock factor and it\u2019s fucking AWFULL!! The Lady of the House of Love3 StarsThis was a retelling of Sleeping Beauty (apparently) where the main character is a house-locked vampire with a penchant for wild-life critters and self-loathing. It was very good but the tense jumping was quite apparent here and I found it removed me from the story several times, which was disappointing as the story itself was quite an interesting concept. The Werewolf & The Company of Wolves 2 Stars, eachThese are both retellings of Little Red Riding Hood and while they had different elements I found them regurgita of each other and found them both unsatisfying. I have never really been a fan of this story to begin with so perhaps that has something to do with my lackluster feeling here, or perhaps I was just becoming far too irritated by tense jumps in Carter\u2019s prose by this point to give much of a shit anymore. Meh.  Wolf-Alice 2 StarsWhen I first started reading this short I thought it was going to be an awesome fairy tale version of the real life phenomenon I did a psychology project on during my only post-secondary foray. There are several stories in humanity\u2019s history of children raised by animals in the wild, probably the most notable being Amala and Kamala who were raised by wolves in the early 1900\u2019s, and the changes that this version of nurturing brings about are outstanding. However, this short story (which I think is based on a fairy tale I\u2019ve never heard of) is not outstanding. -------Pre-Review-------Once Upon a Time... there were two lovely ladies, Jess & Heather, who decided to do a buddy-read of this book and I could not resist joining BECAUSE Fairy tale retellings....Set to commence June 1 July 1, but I didn't actually start it until July 15th because I am the WORST."}, {"userName": "Lotte", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25309949-lotte", "userReview": "[Why is Angela Carter so obsessed with the word 'nipple'? :D Hahaha, this honestly annoyed me after a while.

Gender and power relationships & structures, fantasy and folklore are explored from a critical feminist perspective in a series of tales that excavate, question and challenge the 'latent content' of traditional fairy tales, often by shifting and switching gender and power roles.Some of these subversive tales are redemptive and centre on the breaking of binding enchantments. These liberations come at a cost, at times severely compromising. Carter refuses easy narratives of feminine sexuality, dominance and rebellion. The lush surface of delectable language, varying in tone throughout this collection, is a pleasure that sweetens the bitter pills Carter perspicaciously prescribes.@FeministBC hosted a discussion on the book, to which I contributed, though re-reading I can now see my comments are a bit simplistic. It can be found on their blog hereIn response to readers who found the amount of sexual content objectionable I wrote:\"I identify strongly with these comments \u2013 I consider myself asexual \u2013 but I think Carter is one of far too few writers who describe sex in a useful way. Greer\u2019s classic \u2018The Female Eunuch\u2019 provides some laughable examples of ridiculously idealised sex in writing \u2013 and shows how they only serve to reinforce objectification of women.I think the unpleasantness of Carter\u2019s beasts and so on is really amusing as well as questioning the idealisation and challenging male dominance and power. Sex under patriarchy has this beastly subtext \u2013 isn\u2019t that where victim-blaming and rapist-defending comes from? Boys will be boys \u2013 or, when one thinks about the behaviour involved, boys will be beasts\u2026\"and\"When you say \u2018Carter was writing to shock\u2019 I agree, but I don\u2019t think she does so just to sell books, but rather because she sees patriarchal culture in need of strong challenge: powerful weapons of disgust and discomfort. She ascribes agency in all the wrong places and makes us feel how uncomfortable that is \u2013 she wants us to ask why we are uncomfortable! I also agree that she has deliberately made it accessible to analysis \u2013 she wants people to be able to understand the questions and challenges she poses about the implicit power dynamic in fairytale and cultural norms.\"and\"On Carter\u2019s beasts with ref to sex, I personally feel that partly she is challenging what Greer characterises as the castration of women under patriarchy \u2013 women are objects of desire and have completely passive sexual organs while men feel (forgivably uncontrollable) lust etc. In contrast women\u2019s \u2018beastliness\u2019 can be tender, as well as bold. But I don\u2019t want to push the beast=sexuality line too far and read out all the nuance! I think Carter uses it, but light-heartedly and to hold up the trope for questioning.\"and\"It seems to me that the original rescued Riding Hood is the one who submits (to the wolf and then the hero \u2013 she is powerless), whereas in this story Carter has her turn the power relationship around, but without a fight. This is radical feminism [in original sense, not the recently acquired one of trans-exclusion] really \u2013 changing the dynamic without resorting to the male method of coming to blows. We could have a neater reversal where she kills the wolf or escapes, but the communion that transforms both of them is more interesting, and we SHOULD be disturbed by it \u2013 we haven\u2019t been permitted to see sex in this way, as communication, or hardly as something initiated by women\u2019s desire, and when sex is permissible it\u2019s in a safe environment with safe men, not wolves.\"I am going to re-read this book at some point from a more enlightened position..."}, {"userName": "Eh?Eh!", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137273-eh-eh", "userReview": "Angela Carter wrote stories in a lope and growl that tugs my senses with familiarity, and the edition I read had the small, almost-blurry font that reminded me of the old fairy-tale books I used to check out over and over again as a child.

I'd popped in the BBC's Hamlet with David Tennant and Patrick Stewart (thanks, Bird Brian!) while tackling a ridiculous pile of cookie decorating (...tripling the recipe was probably more than necessary). Even with half-attention my ear was tugged with the line 'and the owl was the baker's daughter.' I remember that line! Carter uses it in her Erl-king story. And with that my mind's stomach plummeted with the realization that I would never be able to read these with full appreciation for all the allusions and clever nuances they're undoubtedly full of. I am blind and deaf and dumb, and my nose is plugged and my skin callused."}, {"userName": "Katya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4324634-katya", "userReview": "As I read the reviews of this book, I came to the following conclusion - in popular YA books, girls aren't going after Prince Charming, but Bluebeard, and there was no better example for this than \"The Bloody Chamber\", the first story in this anthology.Think about it - a man, with several complexes, probably impotent or in possession of some weird blood fetish, purposedly chooses a wife that is both curious and insecure. He presents her with a key, telling her not to go into the room, fully knowing that she would disobey, and then prepares to murder her because she went down the path of ruin he himself placed her on. By doing so, he restores his sense of superiority and for a while, his complexes are quelched. Try to put this theory to Edward Cullen, Daniel Grigori and Damen Auguste and tell me if you see the similarities - why do they choose a weak, insecure girl, starving for attention and understanding, if not to make themselves feel better?This is not a book that you can understand in one sitting. You can read these stories again and again and find a new meaning to them. Also, please note that those aren't the stories sugar-coated to be made fit for mass consumption. Angela Carter writes her stories in the spirit of the original Grimm fairytales - real, raw, full of dark melancholy and, even at times, saucy adult humor. The focus is on the woman, even in Puss-in-boots, where the tom finds an ally in the face of an ingenious tabby.The language in Carter's books has always been a delight, and in \"The Bloody Chamber\", she doesn't disappoint. The sentences are sophisticated, but elegant, and in no time do they sound even remotely clumsy. The story flows easily, and it could appeal both to someone who is studying it for purely academic purposes and to someone reading it just for fun. You'll find yourself easily lost in the imagery and might even feel the urge to paint the sentences on your walls. I already posted a snippet from \"Puss-in-boots\" on my blog, so now here are a few lines from \"The Lady of the House of Love\": She is so beautiful she is unnatural; her beauty is an abnormality, a deformity, for none of her features exhibit any of those touching imperfections that reconcile us to the imperfection of the human condition. Her beauty is a simptom of her disorder, of her soullessness. This is not a book you can pick up, expecting a light, unengaging read. This is a book that will shake you, set your mind on fire and things will never be the same. I loved it.

It was a Christmas present. I asked for it because Terri Windling and Ellen Datlow had mentioned it. I can't remember if it was in one of Year's Best series, which I proudly own every copy of, or one of their fairy tale books. I remember unwrapping the book, and my mother asking if I was sure I wanted it because it was in the \"woman's section\" of the bookstore. I didn't, and still don't, understand why that would be a bad thing. I read it that night.  I loved the book so much that I read Carter's other works, that when Burning Your Boats The Collected Short Stories came out in hardcover, I brought it. I ordered the collection of her screenplays from Amazon's UK website because you couldn't find them here in the U.S. It made me into a Carter lover.For me, this will always be the best Carter. The Bloody Chamber has Carter lush and rich language. My favorite story of the collection is, in fact, the title story. The imagery and description in \"The Bloody Chamber\" are mind blowing. Carter's version is my favorite version of \"Bluebeard\". Her ending is embedded in my brain. I can see it. The collection includes several variations of \"Beauty and the Beast' that address the idea of the animalistic. A question of what exactly a Beast is. If you thought Beast in the Disney movie was more attractive before he became the Prince, you will like these versions.\"The Company of Wolves\" is perhaps the best known story in the collection. I've taught this story and tend it use it every semester. It is closer to being a folk tale and closer to the older Red Riding Hood than it's sister tale of \"Wolf-Alice\".All in all, the tales presented here are wonderfully dark, inviting, and invigorating."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "This book just didn't do it for me and I can say with 100% certainty that I did not like it because of Angela Carter's writing style. I love fairytale retellings but the writing made this book hard to enjoy. The stories themselves weren't actually that bad and I can see why people would like this book but I couldn't like them or get fully into them because of the writing. The writing was insufferable. Carter writes insanely long sentences with tonnes of punctuation and it is the stuff of nightmares for me. Some of the stories had more lenghty sentences than others and I just really hated it. Every time I thought about continuing to read this, I dreaded it and I contemplated just marking it as a DNF because it was so bad. I did skip about 3 stories because I just couldn't get into them. My favourite story was The Bloody Chamber. I would not recommend this book and I probably won't be reading another book by Angela Carter."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "We've all grown up enough to know that what Disney shows us of fairy tales is so far removed from the \"real\" stories from way back in the day. The \"real\" stories are really bloody and pretty gross and totally traumatizing for most wussy children of today to read. It would scare the tuna out of them.Angela Carter's retellings/reimaginings/rewhateverings are more like the original stories, except with a really refreshing feminist slant because the women in these stories have actual voices which is almost unheard of in the original tales. They also have their periods, and have sex, and some other stuff that never seem to come up in Disney because Disney princesses (along with having unnatural body mass indices) do not get their period. That would be unbecoming of a Disney heroine.I adored these stories. The Bloody Chamber is by far the best and the strongest of the collection. It's also the longest, which I think allowed Carter to flex her mind-muscles and creativity a bit. The other stories were fine and dandy, but shorter - some only a page long. Some of those stories could have been longer, as far as I'm concerned. This is where I fail at short stories because sometimes I just want more. I'm greedy.Carter was a fantastic writer, and I love her mind. I didn't love this collection as much as I seemed to really dig Love because Love was my first and I wasn't really sure what to expect - I was surprised, pleasantly. This time I knew what to expect, and already knew enough of the stories to know that I would enjoy them and they would be intense and powerful in ways only good fairy tales should be. It delivered, but it didn't blow me away.But, whatever, I'm just glad that none of these characters were anyone I could visualize in cartoon-format."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32647049-jennifer", "userReview": "I would never encourage anyone else to write like Angela Carter, because in almost any other hands it would be disastrous. But she somehow creates this feast of linguistic decadence that\u2019s sensual, dark, dreamy, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. This short story collection was 160 pages of Carter seducing the English language, and the English language fell HARD. The 10 stories mostly feature fairytale retellings that are as haunting and atmospheric as they are analytical. Carter asks questions about sexuality, evil, and human nature, and how all these themes are shaped by the very structure of traditional fairytales. Brilliantly subversive and luxuriously creepy."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42163117-emma", "userReview": "It is a northern country; they have cold weather, they have cold hearts. Cold; tempest; wild beasts in the forest. It is a hard life. The Bloody Chamber is a collection of fairytale retellings that somehow manages to capture the strange wonder that fairytales held for me as a child while imbuing them with a darker sensuality.The writing is incredibly beautiful. I can't even describe it, you just have to read it:You are always in danger in the forest, where no people are. Step between the portals of the great pines where the shaggy branches tangle about you, trapping the unwary traveler in nets as if the vegetation itself were in a plot with the wolves who live there, as though the wicked trees go fishing on behalf of their friends--step between the gateposts of the forest with the greatest trepidation and infinite precautions, for if you stray from the path for one instant, the wolves will eat you. They are gray as famine, they are unkind as plague. Some of my favorites were: The Bloody Chamber (a Bluebeard retelling from which the collection takes its name), The Lady of the House of Love (creepy vampire girl in an abandoned village), and The Company of Wolves (Little Red Riding Hood).The only two I didn't care much for were Puss in Boots and The Snow Child. The first seemed a bit boring and out of place, and the second was short, confusing, and a bit too weird for me. The narrative also had a tendency to switch tense without warning that I found slightly jarring at times. Still, the collection on the whole was a great read and I recommend to anyone who enjoys their fairytale retellings on the darker side."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley", "userReview": "Your green eye is a reducing chamber. If I look into it long enough, I will become as small as my own reflection, I will diminish to a point and vanish. I will be drawn down into that black whirlpool and be consumed by you.

I have seen the cage you are weaving for me; it is a very pretty one and I shall sit, hereafter, in my cage among the other singing birds but I \u2013 I shall be dumb, from spite.\u201cThe Bloody Chamber\u201d is what you\u2019d get if the Brothers Grimm were feminists. The Gothic European setting in each story, expertly crafted, really establishes the atmosphere in this collection and makes it such a great pick for October. With similarities to Sarah Waters\u2019 \u201cFingersmith,\u201d Jeannette Winters\u2019 \u201cThe Passion,\u201d Bram Stoker's \u201cDracula,\u201d and classic folklore, this book is an essential collection of grown-up fairy tales. Dealing with themes of objectification, virginity, sexuality, identity, entrapment, and animality (be warned), it illuminates feminist issues, presenting these distorted fairy tales as profound metaphors. Each one is grotesque and disturbing in its own way \u2013 except, perhaps, for \u201cPuss-In-Boots,\u201d which incorporates humour into the story through its narrator (and is a personal favourite of mine). This is one author from whom I would very gladly read more. Angela Carter's dark storytelling is engrossing, and her ability to hold nothing back is admirable. A really interesting read with enchanting images, and bold, lyrical language."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "The second time through this book -- with eyes more widely open this time around.
