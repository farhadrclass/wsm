It's a really hilarious, melodramatic book with an absurd and sensational story about a young woman who falls into vice (basically, in the words of Coach from Mean Girls, \"Don't have sex. You will get pregnant. And die.\"). But it provides a really interesting look at the gender roles of the time period, the expectations of women and men, and the concerns of the public about morality and sexuality. So as a historical document, it's pretty valuable. And it's really fun to read.The author led a really interesting life and likes to interject advice about not marrying bum-ish men, since her own husband was kind of a bum. The author also breaks the fourth wall and talks to the reader in some pretty amusing and sarcastic ways. I read this for school, but I had a good time reading it, and if you're looking for historical documents or literature from this time period, this is a good one to start with."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/596084-sandra", "userReview": "I liked this book for several reasons. One, it was the first novel to become an American best-seller. Two, written by a woman who was also a writer of plays, music, textbooks. She was an actress and an educator. At one point, she was the main breadwinner in her family, which her husband approved of. We're talking in mid 1700's here. The story of Charlotte begins in England. She's fifteen years old, the only child of two doting parents. A cute British soldier comes along and convinces her to elope with him to America. Steamy stuff! Then she comes to America, gets pregnant, gets dumped by the British soldier and dies. Why did all early heroine's die in desolation??? That's a whole other topic. What is interesting about Charlotte, from a writer's point of view, is the way she structured the novel. It's written in third person, but along the way, the narrator/author interjects thoughts about the story, statements aimed directly at the reader. There are a few theories out there as to why Rowson did this. One, which is also very interesting, is that by doing so she was able to \"preach\" to her audience, which women couldn't do in Puritan society. In a way, she broke society's rules in a very sneaky way, which is another reason why I like this book."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2203529-laura", "userReview": "Charlotte Temple is the first bestseller published in the United States, and thus an important read for anyone interested in American literature and/or print culture. This novel is very short--a novella, technically--and has a very melodramatic, over-the-top plot. It's basically an early conduct novel, showing young girls and women what consequences come from having sex outside marriage--poverty, ostracism, and death.Charlotte is a young British girl who falls in love with a British officer and follows him to America. Basically, she becomes pregnant with his child, they don't marry, and she dies. The narrator voices her opinion constantly, although this is written in the third person, and this intrusion is actually entertaining.While this novel is certainly offensive by today's standards, I give it four stars for its historical importance and its ability to entertain. It serves as a vehicle for understanding 18th century morals and gender codes as well as a document in the evolution of American print culture. This book is actually the first step in the development of American literature in relation to marketing, storytelling, and form. Not exactly my favorite novel, Charlotte Temple is worth reading--in the way Richardson's Pamela is worth reading. It's a valuable record of the history of the American novel."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3882912-stephanie", "userReview": "All the morality of Jane Austen without any of the fun, Fantine without all the wonderful singing.

The students are already packing up, and the professor is doubting the quality of the assigned work. And so, just as the students are heading out to lunch, the professor casually tosses out a small disclaimer. These form a catalog of hilarious understatements. My Gender and Politics prof warned us that Judith Butler is 'kinda dense,' and a Shakespearean guy admitted that \"The Jew of Malta\" is perhaps 'a teensy bit anti-Semitic,\" and a total whacko allowed that assigning the entirety of \"Huck Finn\" in one night was 'not an easy reading load.'I was therefore very worried when my professor, after telling us to read \"Charlotte Temple\" tonight, delivered an impromptu lecturer After all, even if we think the novel is an unmitigated piece of crap, we shouldn't impose the aesthetic norms of today onto a different time period. Also, these aren't novels, but works, and works exist in a transcendental sphere of language, and literary criticism is a juvenile attempt to force human sensibilities onto the god-like state of the word.

Therefore, I feel justly proud. I kept up with a reading schedule! For a book published in 1795 that would normally take me 5 months to read despite its short length! I finished it in a week! Charlotte Temple was fascinating because of the context that I read it in. When you learn about sentimentalism and its role in American literature and society, Charlotte's tale of woe takes on an entirely new context. Yes, there's a lot of crying and blushing, and it does get tiresome--but that's kind of the point! Charlotte Temple functioned as both a scintillating story and a cautionary tale back in the day, a way for young girls to learn about the social expectations that were awaiting them. By modern feminist standards, does it set a bad example? Sure, but it shouldn't be read that way. This was Rowson's way of protecting girls from the dangers of romance and manipulation. A tale of truth, as she calls it. Both fact and fiction. In a way, it's still relevant today. These expectations of obedience, femininity, and the consequences that befall unruly women still haunt us. Rowson's text is far less subversive than, say, Kate Chopin or Jane Austen, but it's worth reading nonetheless. Truly a pioneer of both the Sentimental movement and in using the novel as a serious literary work."}, {"userName": "Brenda Clough", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3916767-brenda-clough", "userReview": "Alas and alack! I have been a writer too long. I read a work like this, and instead of seeing it as a period piece all I can see is how it should have been written, better. Move the heroine's problems to the fore. Do not lade the beginning with flashbacks -- her grandparents, her parents, her French teacher, argh! Avoid having people tell us their story; far better to have us right there, watching the old grandfather hauled away for debt. And great day in the morning, must all the characters be either black or white, either utterly villainous or incredibly upright? Gray, a perfectly nice color!The introduction by Cathy Davidson is most enlightening, recounting this novel's history and popularity. I do not wonder any more how Nathaniel Hawthorne copped the title of American's first novelist.

In this, it is similar to Hannah Webster Foster's The Coquette; both short novels urge their young female readers against corrupting entanglements with men and against extramarital romantic and sexual relations more generally. Both novels were very popular in their own time and then later dropped out of fashion, until they both were revived at the end of the twentieth century by feminist critics promoting women's fiction and by American literature scholars who wished to historicize the republic's early fiction beyond Charles Brockden Brown. Rowson, though, eschews Foster's cumbersome epistolary style in favor of a preachy but brisk third-person narrator. Her politics, too, are different: Foster's novel promotes American republicanism while Rowson was a British Loyalist whose novel implies that America is not coincidentally the disorderly terrain to which her wayward heroine is seduced.Charlotte Temple tells of a young woman who might be expected to behave well, as she is the daughter of a love match made by a man who charitably rescued his future father-in-law from debt and penury. But Charlotte is seduced as a teenager from her boarding school (with the help of a stereotypically corrupt French schoolmistress) by an English officer bound for America to serve in the Revolutionary War. Rowson introduces many complications that would give me less pleasure to recall than they did to read, but the upshot is that Charlotte finds herself pregnant and abandoned; she eventually dies, but not before her family re-embraces her and promises to rear her child. Moreover, those responsible for her trouble are duly punished\u2014though not her seducer himself; as the only remotely complex character in the novel, he suffers remorse, often tries to do the right thing, and is sometimes extenuated by the plot (as when he is misled that Charlotte has been unfaithful). The novel's narrator is exceedingly interventionist, often sermonizing the reader on the necessity of rectitude and, more intriguingly, of mercy for the penitent unrighteous. In a late chapter, the narrator even reproves the reader for the anticipated objection that Charlotte Temple is melodramatic and tiresome:\u201cBless my heart!\u201d cries my young, volatile reader, \u201cI shall never have patience to get through these volumes, there are so many ahs! and ohs! so much fainting, tears and distress, I am sick to death of the subject.\u201d My dear, cheerful, innocent girl, for innocent I will suppose you to be, or you would acutely feel the woes of Charlotte, did conscience say, thus might it have been with me, had not Providence interposed to snatch me from destruction: therefore, my lively, innocent girl, I must request your patience; I am writing a tale of truth: I mean to write it to the heart: but, if perchance the heart is rendered impenetrable by unbounded prosperity, or a continuance in vice, I expect not my tale to please, nay, I even expect it will be thrown by with disgust. But softly, gentle fair one; I pray you throw it not aside till you have perused the whole; mayhap you may find something therein to repay you for the trouble.Similarly, in her 2004 preface to this Modern Library edition, Jane Smiley distinctly implies that those who dislike Charlotte Temple are akin to her male classmates at Yale in the 1960s who challenged her to name one great female American novelist. According to Rowson, if you her novel bores you, you are corrupt and un-Christian; according to Smiley, if Rowson's novel bores you, you are reactionary and bigoted. You might think that all this special pleading from then till now suggests that Charlotte Temple is just not very good qua novel, and you would be right. While Rowson's high-spirited narratorial persona is sometimes amusingly witty, as when in faux-irritation she answers the objection of an overly-literal reader wondering about some minor details (\"I hope, sir, your prejudices are now removed in regard to the probability of my story? Oh, they are. Well, then, with your leave, I will proceed.\"), this cannot allay the main literary problems. The characters are not even two-dimensional, the narrative arrangement is unbearably tendentious, the narrator constantly hectors the reader, the action is devoid of enlivening imagery, and the style is plain to the point of non-existence. But I reject Smiley's implicit claim that to judge Charlotte Temple not very aesthetically interesting is to disparage women's literary achievement: the first great American poet was a woman, Anne Bradstreet, as was Rowson's English contemporary, the writer who would revolutionize the realist novel, Jane Austen. Recognizing that Bradstreet and Austen are better writers than Rowson is discriminating properly\u2014on artistic, rather than identitarian, grounds.On the other hand, it would be a mistake to write off Charlotte Temple because its moral\u2014counseling girls away from rakes and eroticism and toward marriage\u2014is out of date. Is not, for instance, the point of James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room to renovate for gay desire exactly this celebration of love and fidelity, exactly this disparagement of loveless sex and sensuality? Turning to popular culture, we find much the same sermon from some prominent pulpits. For example: those disappointed by the ending of Gilmore Girls missed the signals the series was sending all along; there is a reason Paris was the comic relief and not the heroine, a reason why Hillary Clinton was never mentioned on the show as anything other than a punchline, a reason why the earthy Luke and Jess form the show's romantic horizon as against the Euro-identified aristo rakes Christopher and Logan, a reason why the series ends with the promise of progeny and of Rory's abandonment, like her mother's before her, of her worldly ambitions and of her settling down with Jess. This recommendation against individualism and for sentimental community is the aboriginal form of middle-class feminism and will be with us as long as we have the middle class. We now allow for more forms of sexual desire and more sexual acts than Rowson would countenance (though she does advocate mercy toward sexually active girls), but is her morality, her culture, really so different from ours?"}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5808276-alyssa", "userReview": "Well, I'm back to reading books for a college class. And this is the first thing I had to read this term? Ugh. Sometimes the life of an English major isn't quite so glamorous.I will say that while I didn't love this book (written in the late 1700s), I didn't hate it either. Once you get past the old writing style and accept that the author will direct certain passages directly to her reader, it has a pretty good story line. Of course, you also have to bear in mind that the story is built around the ideals of the 1700s where girls of certain classes were expected to have their parents' permission to marry and eloping leads to the ruin of girls.Charlotte is a good girl. She's being educated by a well known and trustworthy lady. However, the French teacher, Mademoiselle La Rue, is not a good girl and really shouldn't be friends with Charlotte. La Rue encourages Charlotte to do things that are inappropriate for a girl of her station, which leads to Charlotte meeting a soldier by the name of Montraville. Between La Rue and Montraville, they convince Charlotte to elope with him to New York, where his company is ordered to be.She hates betraying her family, and eventually, Montraville forgets about her for a girl of significant wealthy. Poor Charlotte is left pregnant and rather delusional. Her reputation is completely ruined and she quickly spirals.It's kind of a sad story about a sweet girl who was lead astray by people who should have been protecting her. In the end, I felt bad for Charlotte, hated La Rue, and actually kind of pitied Montraville. While this story isn't very relevant for today's society, I can see how it was so popular in the time it was written.But, I did get a little weary of the author talking to her reader about things other than Charlotte's story. I also thought certain points were a little preachy, but then I'm a 21st century girl reading a story about an 18th century girl.

I'm not sure why, but the style reminded me of Jane Austen's juvenilia, which could be a good or a bad thing, depending. A novel of sensibility, with an abundance of fainting, a very foreign (to our eyes) framework of feminine virtue, and comically blatant didactic asides. Charlotte is a super sweet lil' gal who loves mommy and daddy & wants to be virtuous, but also (!) is horny & wants to follow a rakish man to America so she can get her rocks off. Fairly typical fallen woman narrative ensues, with a few fun hijinks thrown in.The rest of my class thought it insufferable; I found it so heavy-handed as to be really entertaining. Did I have a particular emotional investment in Charlotte's outcome? Nah. But it's a really short read, it's interesting historically, and the characters are so ridiculous that you just have to enjoy your time with them.

The only image she had of the world was that of her little community & girls boarding school.

Why oh why didn't you listen to your parents?Lol. So, my opinion on this piece? I adored the omniscient narrator. I loved the way she would degress from the story, jump around between the perspectives and comment on the characters' behavior throughout. Sometimes it was so hilarious. She would address the readers directly and it was so fun at times.When looking at this book from today's perspective (and a feminist one), I found it quite interesting how the narrator, our moral compass and teacher, judges them. Charlotte is blamed for giving into passion and love and lust perhaps as well, whilst her father Mr Temple is complemented on acting on love and therefore going against his parents double standards?? But yeah, Charlotte was just naive and stupid. Not once did she use her brains. Quite disappointing for a female lead. The same is true for her mother... She isn't even strong enough to go look for her daughter in the States. Weak women, of course. Perfect for the time.But hey we also have some more active women in there. Mademoiselle La Rue for instance, a woman of loose morals and the female villain cause she is so improper, the narrator can hardly bear it. Once in the book, it is mentioned that females are supposed to be meek, good natured and should they be deceived and acted upon cruelly, good and honour bound women break while those of loose morals seek revenge. Ha. Alright then. Concerning filial duty, I cannot but laugh and find that hilarious. I mean, can we just say that women and men have brains they can make use of and hence not be deceived by villains? I don't think adhering to rules blindly (as the narrator suggests it) is the way to go.Anyways, from a historical perspective, it's quite interesting how gender roles are portrayed, how women are viewed, what men are supposed to achieve etc."}, {"userName": "Vel Veeter", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69444656-vel-veeter", "userReview": "Early yet, but this time American. In this early novel, we have a young English woman who falls in love with a real cad. Something there is that loves a cad in literature. So Charlote Temple falls for this British officer who whisks her off to America to live. Then the war happens and he must leave her in a house on her own with only one servant. He also decides to leave her, pregnant and alone for another woman. Now alone for real, she has a series of mishaps and misfortunes that cause to put her trust in further men and have that trust abused. It\u2019s a pretty timeless tale.The issue with this book is that while it\u2019s not super boring, like the above one, it\u2019s a skeleton of a novel hung on a wire frame with almost no depth at all. It\u2019s 100 pages long with 35 chapters. It takes 40% of the book to even have Charlotte Temple born, grown up, and married, so that the bulk of the plot happens in the leftover parts. Also, there\u2019s a really issue with this book being the kind of book where the author has no clear way to tell the story so it\u2019s a tale passed on in three different levels of narrative before it even begins to happen. That can be interesting when the idea is to create distance between the story and the speaker. And as far as early novels go, there\u2019s always a kind of sorting this kind of thing out, but this is an early novel but a super early novel. It\u2019s a 100 years hence Oroonoko, and yet that artificial frame is still being used as a crutch."}, {"userName": "Lina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12178829-lina", "userReview": "Uhm... nope.For it's time, it was revolutionary. Luckily, my foremothers fought so that I would be unable to imagine myself in the shoes of Charlotte - for yes, she's annoying.But also, she was fucking kidnapped and they kept acting as though she ran away. According to the text, Montraville simply threw her into the chaise and then she fainted (about the only thing she has any talent in - that girl can faint in a mosh pit). I'm supposing that the delicate sensibilities of the male sex required Susanna Rowson to spare them the reality of the text, so that they may not follow Charlotte's continuous abuse of fainting couches (though those same delicate sensibilities that nature inherently placed into the male bosom might explain why male readers were so able to connect with the protagonist). Still, as a modern reader, it is annoying.And then...\"the seeds of filial affection\"Are we sure this wasn't supposed to be porn?(I really want to know more about Susanna Rowson's life now, though. The introduction was the best part of the book. Who cares about little Miss Faint-a-lot? Gimme textbook writing teacher actress musician author badass already!)"}, {"userName": "CharlieDickens", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66098991-charliedickens", "userReview": "Oozing sentimentality and melodramatic occurrences, Charlotte Temple is a fine example of early American literature. Morals, virtue, the role of woman in society, the new American Republic - so many interesting pieces on the chessboard here. Judging it solely as a literary piece (in the most literal of terms), and from the point of view of my own worldview with all of its preconceived notions, Rowson deserves two stars. The incessant moralizing from the author, to the 21st century reader at least, could deem it necessary to reduce the rating further.In saying this, for the entertainment value - incessant fainting, damsel in distress, mankind and its vices, bastard child and death - Rowson deserves a four. In finality, the historical significance of this book is indeed priceless. The insight into late 18th century United States is fascinating. Would recommend Charlotte Temple for any true lover of books who wants to get a feel for a certain timeframe in the span of American literature rather than for those who chase the thrill of a literary masterpiece upon commencement of every novel. So, buckle up and enjoy the ride. Feel the highs and lows of the only character that is in any way more than one dimensional (Montraville) and prepare to tut tut at silly girls and their vices. Especially those Frenchies!"}, {"userName": "Courtney(classicswithcourtney)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40347381-courtney-classicswithcourtney", "userReview": "I forgot to put this on Goodreads! Anyway I had to read this for my early American literature course. I read it on audiobook (yes if you read my reviews there had been a pattern lately) and like I always say I feel like I loose something from just listening so I will need to reread this in the future.This book is one of the first popular books in American Literature. It falls under the lost genre of seduction tales, which were popular at the time for teaching young girls about chastity and all those good lessons. Like another reviewer said, this book is bad. But this book is so bad that it\u2019s good. It\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s melodramatic, it\u2019s very strange, and it\u2019s fun to discuss with a class. My class also talked about if the author is sarcastic in some sections and how much ambivalence the text allows. I liked this novel. It was a crazy ride and I enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Rebekah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6341901-rebekah", "userReview": "3.7 starsIt was really cool to learn that this was the first bestseller in the United States until Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1854, written by a woman no less! The book itself is alright. It is very melodramatic: full of swooning and tragedy. The author breaks the fourth wall several times to caution the readers against the dangers of immoral behavior. On its own, the book isn't really anything special, and can be annoying at times for modern readers. However, it's interesting to look at within its historical context, and Rowson seems like she was a very interesting person, and progressive for her era. It's worth a read if you'd like to know what fascinated people at that time in America."}, {"userName": "Ellie Kidger", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66224453-ellie-kidger", "userReview": "A short and sweet conduct novel, Charlotte Temple presents a sympathetic protagonist tricked and ruined by various villains. The pacing is nice, but some chapters feel mixed up in places, which is a shame for such a well-rounded text. However, it's very much a product of its time, with the characters being very typical archetypes for the period, and with none of them receiving much development.Another issue is the author's reliance on reminding the reader to be virtuous and pure, which feels a bit forced, and stops the plot from being as effective as it could have been."}, {"userName": "Katie Spica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64344713-katie-spica", "userReview": "3.5/5I enjoyed this in some ways. In others, I did not.Charlotte Temple is not really the most sympathetic character, though she definitely does not deserve what is dealt unto her.Also, I'm not 100% sure what I am supposed to glean from this. We all die, so be kind and maybe things will turn out alright, but probably not?The only other main theme you could get from this is perhaps that \"men ain't shit\" in which case, I would have to wholeheartedly agree.In conclusion, I had to read this for class and it was like a more mediocre-version of a Jane Austen novel, so I liked it."}], "description": "This book was converted from its physical edition to the digital format by a community of volunteers.
