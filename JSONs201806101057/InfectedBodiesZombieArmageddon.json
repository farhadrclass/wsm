This is yet another angle on the zombie outbreak based around the Breakspear housing estate, this time focused on the \"posh\" apartment block; The Mill.Again, lots of character based action and how different people react to the Armageddon zombie style; some thrive and some do not!The unique twist that is the \"possible\" evolution of the zombie, or at least another strain, is again bubbled to the surface with the strange, yet beautiful Alex and her minions - Dennis (?Wheatly), Vincent (?Price) and Christopher (?Lee); did IW just make a massive nod the horror greats?As the two groups make their way towards each other for a munch and kill showdown the undead are merely the side show.The ending is abrupt but IW explains that this is that all three books can be read as stand alone novels, but entice you to read book no.4 which brings all the groups together!"}, {"userName": "Wanda Hartzenberg", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5663614-wanda-hartzenberg", "userReview": "Although not as gook two, this is still not bad book.

This time around the action is centred on an apartment building with a gym and a bar underneath and \u2018luxury\u2019 flats above. We are introduced to new types of creature as well as the usual chaos and carnage!Having read the previous two books in this series, I was eager to get my hands on this one. Wow! Was it ever a good\u2019un! It had a much more claustrophobic feel as it was based primarily in the flats. We are introduced to a new sort of \u2018Queen Zombie\u2019 who can infiltrate minds and uses her feminine wiles to trap her victims. Making a welcome return are the child zombies who live in the wall cavities and can scuttle up the walls and along the ceilings like spiders! These were briefly touched on in the first book. All these plus the usual odious characters make for a rip roaring stonker. As well as rooting for the few good guys, I was screaming at the bad guys to hurry up and get offed already. There was slightly more gore this time around but it wasn\u2019t in your face and not until about a third of the way through. The horror built up slowly with a couple of early pointers. I have to say I love Ian\u2019s work and this is no disappointment. Get it of you have read the others, hell just get it and enjoy the ride!!"}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7148021-cathy", "userReview": "Before starting Ian Woodhead's Zombie Armageddon series, I always held Brian Keene's zombie books on a pedestal. \"No one does zombies like Keene\" was one of my favourite sayings. Before starting on Woodhead's Book 3, I had just finished reading Brian Keene's Entombed which had completely disappointed me and on reading the first few pages of Infected Bodies, I was thinking \"Brian who?\" Yep, Ian Woodhead knows zombies and he certainly knows how to keep things terrifying. Like the first couple of books in the series, we are introduced to characters who are instantly likeable or the complete opposite. While I found myself pushing for the good guys, I also wanted to get full value out of the evil characters.Ian's writing ,as always, kept me engrossed. My only complaint was that at times I found the jumping back and forth into different scenes made reading a little disjointed but I overcame this as I got further into the book and more familiar with the various characters.Looking forward to getting into No. 4."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2074065-lisa", "userReview": "Although this is the third book in its series, it is the first story I\u2019ve read by Ian Woodhead. With that said, this book works well on its own, with a decently rounded story arc, good characters and great prose. The narration slides from gruesome to tongue-in-cheek witty, to dark and sexy with ease.I felt that the zombies were well done. The children were very creepy, as were the scenes with the human \u201cpets\u201d. The ending felt a lot like slamming full-speed into a brick wall, although the Afterward helped me to be more forgiving of it. If you like zombie survival horror, you should check out this series."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19184609-angie", "userReview": "Another good book in the zombie Armageddon series. This one was set in a old mill that has been converted into apartments. No council estate in this one. And it had the addition of lots of freaky zombie kids that scurry around the walls and ceilings like spiders. Very creepy!It was well written and it had a whole new lot of people to get eaten and turn into zombies. Good fun, there was even another of the thinking zombies, this'd time it was a freak of a woman. Don't know how the next one will be like, but if its anything like the first three I'm so looking forward to it."}, {"userName": "Leslie Wiederspan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18142405-leslie-wiederspan", "userReview": "The first 3 books... Meh. Good ideas, but poorly executed. So many characters to keep straight, only to have some die after you meet them. You don't find out where this all takes place until much later. So, in the meantime, there are tons of phrases that make absolutely no sense, unless you are from Britain. There are tons of editing mistakes as well. The worst is in the third book, Infected Bodies. words misspelled, quotation marks missing, wrong name or gender used, etc. It's just not the best zombie series I've read, but its not the worst either."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6016599-mary", "userReview": "Another really fun zombie book in the series! I enjoyed reading this one, too, and it kept me really into it for the most part.Still could use a little more editing though, as the run-ons were a little distracting to me.
