Essentially, I judged the book by the cover (the crisp, white snow appealed to me on a hot summer day). Nora Peterson and Jenna Montgomery were two moms who had to deal with the consequences and rewards of organ donation, respectively. Nora lost someone she loved, which led to Jenna\u2019s daughter being able to finally live. The story switched point-of-view from Nora to Jenna and vice versa as the chapters advanced. As dizzying as this might sound, the stories were still relatively easy to follow. My main concern was for the plot to progress more quickly, and that Nora and Jenna would reach their respective happy endings already. While the plot was stretched to the point of tearing, I did enjoy the tiny twist in the beginning. Sure, I expected there to be a twist since the buildup was so meticulous, but it was a good shock regardless. I charged forward, forcing myself to continue reading as I refuse to abandon any books. I could not relate to Nora\u2019s pain, and Snelling never opened up Nora\u2019s emotions enough so that I could even sympathize with her situation over losing a loved one. Instead, I thought her moping and dragging herself around the house (figuratively and literally) prevented any emotion from rising from the pages and into my heart. I wanted to slap her and push her to get some help. Jenna\u2019s story was just as long (the time was parallel, thank goodness), but Heather, Jenna\u2019s daughter who received a heart transplant, seemed almost metafictional as her sense of time was identical to my own. She thought everything was taking forever, and in both of our realities, it was. Heather was my favorite character because she was funny and endearing, and she never pitied her own circumstances. When the novel finally ended, I wondered if the two mothers should have met, but I think had they met, Nora would never be able to get over the death of her family member and Jenna would feel so much guilt. Perhaps the ending was happy after all. On the other hand, my sentiments after reading this novel were not so positive.Quick note: For those who don't like reading books that delve heavily into religion and faith, this is certainly not your cup of tea."}, {"userName": "Cindy Scinto", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10245244-cindy-scinto", "userReview": "As I read through this story, I understood the chapters switching back and forth between two different families. But the end left an unknown with the introduction of a new element. As a two time organ recipient, this ending left me bewildered at the outcome.A few organ transplant medical facts were not accurate, but I do have to live through the daily routines and procedures.The character, Nora, was a bit two dimensional and her routine mundane and repetitive even for someone in mourning.The other family's fate was too predictable and characters were well behaved leaving them a bit vanilla. I never felt an urgency in the story, or a place where I gasped at the next page's revelation.

The plot wasn't terribly original, but could have been decent if the characters weren't so one-dimensional and their actions so predictable. I found myself almost skimming as I read, looking for something interesting. Another issue I had is that the publisher should have marketed this book as a \"Christian\" book because it was all about church and God.

When tragedy strikes the Peterson\u2019s home, the family is left to make a hard decision about organ donation. The story centers much around this decision being made in the core of intense grief, a decision that can very well save others lives.Nora\u2019s story is one of battling grief and loss, as well as struggling with the depression that can follow such tragic events. As she questions everything, her family and her best friend try hard to wrap her in love. How does one go on after something like this happens? How does one get up in the morning? Breath? Forgive? Heal?Jenna\u2019s story follows the miracle side of her daughters new heart. Sure there are opportunities for heart rejection, but now that this big weight is lifted off their lives and the impending thoughts of \u201ctheir last Christmas together\u201d seems to disappear and as each day shows improvement and healing\u2026 it makes room for something else in Jenna\u2019s life. Something there was no room for in the fear of losing her daughter\u2026.There is hope. The two families never meet and I think that is a brilliant choice by author Lauraine Snelling. It would have been easy to pull them together in the end and let them see what they have done for each other\u2026 both healing in their own sense of the word. The fact that this is not the case, adds a sense of imbalance as you wonder whether their paths will cross and the result is a good read, without the all too neat ribbon and bow packaging in the end.I have to admit, I do not read many Christmas related stories due to the overall neatness that seems to be within the pages of such reads. The overall sugary perfect effect leaves me with nothing to ponder on. This was not the case in One Perfect Day. This book left me not only with thoughts on families coping with tragedies the best they know how, but also on the importance of organ donation.This book is a recommended read this winter as you curl up in a comfy chair and a hot cup of cocoa. A small, quick read that packs a lot of punch within its pages.Enjoy!Lauraine Snelling is a Christian Fiction author who with this book, I have now read for the first time.

Grief, anxiety, guilt, doubt and depression are painted in blacks and grays on a wide canvas. Admittedly, love, devotion, friendship, loyalty, compassion and faith are also represented but struggle to gain much notice until the very end and even then there is a lingering aftertaste of melancholy about this book.Snelling is true to her established habit of being meticulously detailed in all her descriptions. She presents dialogue and actions with thought-stream addenda (in italics). She has the skill to insert her readers into every situation to become acquainted with the narrating characters--in this case Nora and Jenna. The events in each of these characters' lives are juxtaposed synchronously in alternating chapters. I was rather disappointed that the two story lines did not consummate sufficiently at the end. (Due to \"legal complications\"? This being fiction, surely they could have been sidestepped.) If the two families had been able to meet it would have brought this two dimensional tale to a more satisfying third dimensional conclusion. But, overall, this work offers fetching insight into the process of grieving, and of healing, and the vital importance of caring friends, clergy and health care providers during personal crisis."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19249563-christine", "userReview": "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

Yes, as a heart recipient, I become more attached to stories involving heart transplant but this one, by the author\u2019s detailed descriptions, especially of the many emotions involved on either side, kept pulling me back to a true to life story vs. the fictional novel it really is. That takes a gifted writer who has done their research beyond just the surface medical facts we so often find in such novels. Its much harder to understand and then portray the true human experience behind those surface facts and in One Perfect Day, Lauraine Snelling captures those feelings well in telling her story of these two families.The overall format is one of alternating chapters, each in turn showing the impact of loss and joy as lived by each mother. One lives with the fear that in turning off the ventilator, a situation faced by too many families of tragic accidents, she has \u201ckilled my son\u201d which I have heard in those same exact words in conversation with many donor families. Another common feeling, that a parent is not meant to outlive their children, touches another common life experience.On the recipient side, a young girl, fighting for life with a failing heart, receives her Christmas gift of a life saving heart transplant just in time. The emotions on that side offer a counter balance to the reciprocal story, making for deeper understanding on behalf of the reader of how the two sides play out so differently, but so interdependently. I found myself in tears as the urgent call comes and police support plays out in getting the young patient emergency transport to the hospital, so beautifully told in this story teller\u2019s gifted writing.A good family read, there is a thread of spiritual faith throughout, one that shows all sides of the human emotions that play in such circumstances \u2013 praying for miracles, anger at seemingly unanswered prayers, frustration and hope, sorrow and joy, all so humanly told, but ending up leaving us a sense of God\u2019s support in life. The two stories come together in a rather abrupt but emotional two page Epilogue ending that touches the heart in its reading, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say so as to not spoil your own discovery in reading this wonderful book.see this and more than a hundred other organ donation/transplant related books - many with my personal reviews - at http://www.trioweb.org/resources/book..."}, {"userName": "Janice", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47946016-janice", "userReview": "This book shows two families.

After all the countless times her husband, Gordon, has been traveling for business, they were all going to be home together to celebrate those time honored traditions she had hoped would continue on as her twin teenagers Charlie and Christi grew and had families of their own. Knowing that Gordon would be flying home late from Germany she had hoped he would at least call to let her know he was on his way. When she tried calling his phone all she got was voice mail. The only thing she could do was simply pray that everything would be fine despite the worry settling in her stomach. Her children were expected home soon and then they would begin the Christmas celebration none of them would ever forget. Everything would be just perfect. .For Jenna Montgomery, this would undoubtedly be her daughter, Heather's last Christmas. Growing weaker by the day due to a defect in her heart, she wasn't sure just where she was on the transplant list. For them, they refused to speak of things in their finality. Last time decorating the tree, last time making Christmas cookies or opening presents. At least for Jenna should could hope that it would be a good Christmas for Heather. But when she announced she was more tired than she expected and running a slight fever, Jenna knew from her experience as an ER nurse that these were not the signs of something good, but her worst fears being confirmed. She was losing Heather and they wouldn't even make it to see Christmas this year. Sometimes life hands up things we hoped would never fall on our plates. We always hope that the bad things in life will escape us and happen to someone else. But when that doesn't happen, it is hard for us to remember how to breathe again. To remember despite all the doubts, that God is still in control even if it seems like this went by His attention unnoticed. If God can do anything, why doesn't He answer our prayers they way we want? For both the Peterson's and the Montgomery family, both of their prayers will be answered just not in the fashioned either had hoped. How each family deals with those answers takes the readers on a chilling look at what grief looks like during one of the worst times in a families life and how they will rise to find a way to move ahead and see the good God can bring from it. I received One Perfect Day by Lauraine Snelling compliments of Faith Words, a division of Hachette Book Groups for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained in this review are strictly my own. This is a difficult novel to read because it deals with death and the implications that affect the family in such a surreal way, you can easily relate to what it must be like dealing with the situation. While grief affects us all differently, there is no time table for when life returns to normal. For some, they find solace in getting back into their routines again; for others simply trying to find a way to get through the day is a challenge in itself. I believe Lauraine did an exceptional job at taking one of the hardest subjects to face in life and show the beauty that can come from it even though it never fades. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars and it even includes a reader discussion guide that is perfect for book clubs or for small study groups dealing with loss."}, {"userName": "Connie Rehman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44819169-connie-rehman", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading this book. The subject is difficult to read about, but I thought the author richly conveyed the depths of despair that a family goes through upon suddenly losing a loved one. She also conveyed the fear and dread of the eventual outcome of losing a loved one because they were so far down on the waiting list for a much needed transplant. She used every other chapter to convey what was happening simultaneously between the two families. The connection is made between the two families at the end of the book in a letter.

I will cry at the drop of a hat during a movie, but it takes something truly special for a book to make me cry. Even the touching and heart-wrenching story line of \"Fault In Our Stars\" didn't make me cry. This book made me cry. It was beautifully written and I felt so deeply connected to Nora. Maybe the fact that when I was reading this book I was leaving my family in my hometown to drive 3.5 hours away to where I currently live for college had something to do with it. Something about this book pulled me in almost instantly. It is such an 'easy' read. Not that the material is a light subject matter, but that you can spend an hour or two wrapped in this book and have no idea where all of your time is going. With that being said, the book lost it's magic pull on me about 3/4 of the way through the novel. I felt that things were starting to become boring as nothing new was really happening. From my raving review that I started with, you are probably wondering why I only gave this book 3 stars. There are a few reasons.1) The ending was absolutely horrible. I don't even know if I could call it an ending. We are left with Nora alone in the house and Christi off running around finally admitting that she might need to talk to someone. We get no closure on Heather and this new romance between Jenna and Randy. I also think that the letter Heather wrote to Nora's family was kind of a joke. It didn't evoke any emotion. It seemed very plainly written and it didn't do justice to the sacrifice that the family had to make.2) I'm not sure that I like the romance between Jenna and Randy. It is just plain weird. I think that a relationship with a person's brother-in-law is off limits. From the way Randy describes how long he was waiting for Jenna, it sounds like he may have loved her even when she was married to her brother. I was hoping a love would blossom between Jenna and the Pastor that she met in Omaha, but I was disappointed. I think that Snelling could have presented a love story for Jenna without it having to be her brother-in-law. That is something that I don't this is socially acceptable to many people and should have been avoided.3) There was a moment of 'climax' when Heather's body may have begun rejecting the heart, but it never turned into anything. It was actually very anticlimactic and quite a let down. If Snelling wanted to introduce another upset in the story line, she should have played it out quite a bit more. It seemed like a desperate attempt to bring a little bit of excitement back into the boring end of the novel. It should have been left out completely and more focus should have been put on Heather living her new life.At the beginning of the book, I most certainly would have thought about adding this book to my personal collection. However, upon finishing, I no longer feel a desire to do so. If I ever feel the need to read the book again, which I don't think I will, then I will just go find it in the library."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10549695-margaret", "userReview": "This is the story of two mothers, one who has lost a child and her faith; one whose daughter has been given a new chance at life and who relies on prayer to restore health to her child.It is Christmas and Nora is planning for the perfect Christmas because she knows that once her 17 year old twins go off to college the following year, life for all of the family will change. Little did she know that the change would come before Christmas Day would arrive. Dealing with the tragic loss of one of her children, she loses all interest in life, her family, her friends, her health, and most of all she has lost her faith in God.Jenna Montgomery is also planning for the perfect Christmas because she knows that her twenty year old daughter could very well be celebrating the holiday one last time. A severe heart defect has plagued her daughter for most of her life and Jenna recognizes the symptoms easily. She has seen them many times as a mother and as a nurse. But, one telephone call from the family doctor has given Jenna hope.The story of both families is told in alternating chapters. For me, I felt Nora's pain more than I felt Jenna's joy. Nora's anger and resentment for the loss of her son seemed to outshine Jenna's joy and hope, partly because everything just seemed to fall in place for Jenna and her daughter with the arrival of Jenna's brother-in-law. That part of the story seemed to take over, focusing on the relationship between the two of them, rather than on Jenna's daughter--it seemed that Jenna became the main character in that story line.While I cringed at Nora's outrage and her treatment of friends and family, especially of her surviving child, I could understand it. It took several months for Nora to begin to function as a wife, a mother, a friend. I imagine that that would be the case for any parent dealing with the death of a child. Jenna? I just didn't feel much of what she herself should have, in my opinion, have been feeling at the thought that her daughter could resume a healthy, active life. She had stars in her eyes for her own future and that bothered me.And the end? I felt as though I hit a brick wall in the last chapter. I was waiting for the final chapters on both of the women and suddenly the book ended. It was as if the author had tired of writing and just wanted to finish the story at all costs.

She writes Christian fiction and until now I had never read any of her other novels. You can be sure I will be now. I love her style of writing, the story just seems to flow so well. I also love how her writing took me on an emotional journey.This novel is about two families who are impacted in different ways by one very tragic event-one is impacted in a good way, the other bad. The story is weaved around the two mothers in the story, Nora and Jenna. Nora wants nothing more than the perfect Christmas this year. Her twins are still home but they're going to be off to school the next year and she just knows that everything will change after that. She just didn't plan on it changing long before then. Jenna is a nurse with a daughter who has a bad heart-she has been on a heart transplant list for a long time and she is getting continually worse. While Nora is planning for a perfect Christmas, Jenna is wondering if this will be her last with her daughter Heather. Then, a miracle. A heart is available for Heather but as Jenna finds out sometimes a miracle isn't as easy to accept as you would think it would be.This novel affected me so much. I cried and I laughed. There are parts that tear at your heart and others that leave you so hopeful and full of thanks for what some people sacrifice for others in terms of organ donation. It's a difficult situation all around. The family that loses their loved one is devastated and suffering and on the other hand the family that gets the life saving organ is overjoyed and thankful but often feel grief for the family that made the sacrifice.I would recommend this novel especially for anyone who enjoys Christian fiction but even just for anyone who loves an emotional, heart tugging story. You can visit Lauraine Snelling's website here. Many thanks to Miriam at Hachette Books for sending me this wonderful novel.

Both families appear well-adjusted and epitomize the midwest all-American ideal with no dysfunction beyond the \"normal\" communication barriers all people face.

This contemporary novel takes place in Minnesota, but the story could take place in anywhere at any time.Beyond the highly religious overtones throughout the story, although inherent in Snelling's writing, the story is endearing and hopeful while instilling ideas of miracles and recovery. Easy to read, this novel reflects the pain and horror of losing a dear one, especially a child or other close relative. Creatively, Snelling draws on the pain we the readers feel when we witness a loss so grave. At times, tears flow while reading this novel. An underlying message throughout the novel is that no matter how good you think you are, you cannot escape the shear dread of losing a person so close to you. In perfect time for the holidays, One Perfect Day stands out as a Christian fiction miracle.Review by Carolyn Espe"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50448-becky", "userReview": "Two families. One will receive a Christmas miracle; the other will experience a Christmas tragedy. Nora Peterson has two seniors getting ready to graduate from high school--twins, one boy, one girl. Jenna Montgomery has a daughter, Heather, who is dying and needs a heart transplant. (She's just twenty and has been sick most of her life.) One child will live, one will die. Both families want this Christmas to be perfect. Nora because she somewhat naively believes this will her family's last Christmas together since they will be off for college the next year. Jenna because she knows that unless a transplant comes through this will be--no question about it--the very last Christmas with her daughter. Each day Heather struggles just to breathe.One Perfect Day chronicles the lives of two families--though the two never meet--as they celebrate and mourn. It's a story of hope and despair, love and loss, and redemption.I don't know about other readers--so I could be alone here--but I never felt a connection with the Peterson family. Nora and Gordon. Christi and Charlie. It didn't matter if it was before, during or after...I just never felt this family was real or genuine. I felt Nora to be a bit plastic, a bit going through the motions, even before the tragedy strikes. Gordon, again, felt disconnected from his family. Like he wasn't really present in his home, in his relationships. I generally felt that the family was broken on the inside before they became broken on the outside.The Montgomery family, on the other hand, was vital from the very beginning. I felt that Jenna and Heather and Uncle Randy were alive, authentic, genuine, sincere. Their family, their story resonated. I cared for them from the start.\u00a9 Becky Laney of Becky's Book Reviews"}], "description": "This is the story of two mothers, strangers to one another.   The first has two children--twins, a boy and girl, who are seniors in high school. She wants their last Christmas as a family living in the same home to be perfect, but her husband is delayed returning from a business trip abroad. And then there's an accident--a fatal one involving a drunk driver.   Meanwhile, the other mother has a daughter who needs a new heart, and so the loss of one woman becomes the miracle the other has desperately prayed for. While one mother grieves, and pulls away from her family, the other finds that even miracles aren't always easy to receive.", "title": "One Perfect Day", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3046475-one-perfect-day", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1267733985l/3046475.jpg", "reviews": 160, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8565.Lauraine_Snelling", "name": "Lauraine Snelling"}], "type": ["Christian Fiction", "Holiday", "Fiction", "Christian"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3046475-one-perfect-day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/568947.Ruby", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/568952.An_Untamed_Land", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/568941.Pearl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867104-daughter-of-twin-oaks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/568938.A_Promise_for_Ellie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
