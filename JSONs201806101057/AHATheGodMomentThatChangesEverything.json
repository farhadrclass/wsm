It belongs on the shelf of anyone who is involved in pastoral counseling on either a personal or professional level. The process of Awakening, Honesty, Action, rooted in the biblical parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15) provides powerful handles for anyone needing to make positive change in their lives. Kyle writes with warmth and compassion and a great sense of Gen X humor (don't be surprised if there's a profound insight into Scripture in the same paragraph as a reference to Saved By the Bell). Lots of us have had \"Sudden Awakenings\" (and if you never have, you probably will) that are the result of either difficult circumstances, deserved consequences, or both. What we do with them makes all the differences. If we try to take action without honesty, we fail. And if we have the courage to be brutally honest with ourselves without taking immediate action, we will just lose hope and believe we are beyond redemption. AHA walks you through how to do all three. The last chapter of the book is especially relevant for those who feel like they haven't messed up. By turning his attention to the older brother in the parable, Kyle helps us deal with our response to the prodigals in our lives."}, {"userName": "Hines", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52070077-hines", "userReview": "This was a thought provoking book.

I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been a Christian for decades. But when Kyle Idleman began to probe my heart with the details of the Parable of the Prodigal Son, I began to change my mind. In Kyle\u2019s mind, the return of a prodigal to the father is not a one-time occurrence, but a recurring event that needs to take place in our lives.In his model, based on the tale of the prodigal son, he suggests we need a good Awakening to the condition of our spiritual lives. Then we need to face the facts about ourselves with raw Honesty. And finally, we need this newfound awareness of our condition to lead us to Action. In steps that are incredibly simple, readers learn to identify areas of their lives ripe for change BEFORE we hit rock bottom. I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and laced with stories, many of which were laugh-out-loud funny. (My favorite was the one he told about his ears. I was laughing so hard I was crying.) I actually think this is the model of what every good Christian book should be\u2014easy to read, enjoyable, and packs a punch.Until we learn to love people the way Jesus loved people, we still have prodigal hearts. I learned to look at things differently and see areas of my life where I\u2019ve been prodigal and I need to return to the Father for help.I\u2019m sure you will enjoy and feel challenged by AHA.

If you had, you would most certain have experienced something that this book talks about, the AHA moment.This book is really meant for \u201cborn christian\u201d or those who have slipped from their christian lives. Kyle Idleman has written this book to persuade christians to turn back, before it\u2019s too late. The main bible passage used in this book is Luke 15:11-32, the Parable of the Prodigal Son.The book is spilt into 3 parts, first the awakening, the realisation of your wrong. Next, the honesty to agree, admit and confess your wrongdoing, and lastly, to act on this information that you now have.Idleman first talks about the awakening process or moment that one experiences when one realises the consequences of the wrong doing one had done. This section really calls the readers to examine and think through about their own lives, will they not turn back? Have they not seen what their lives had now become? Do they want to continue?Next, Idleman moves on to tackle some of the common \u201cdefence mechanism\u201d that one may utilise to delay or excuse themselves from taking action after they had the AHA moment. The few defence mechanism seems more to be taken from Freud\u2019s idea of defence mechanism, but is supported by bible verses in their respective chapters. Lastly, Idleman talks about the need to take action, it is not sufficient just to have this AHA moment or agree and admitting what you have done wrong, action is required to repent from this wrong. Idle man strongly urges the readers not to stop in this process, and to take action, immediately! However, the weakness of this book is how it is lacking on the God at work in man\u2019s heart. The book does show very strongly how one should and must turn back to God. Yet it is silent on how God must first work in our hearts to do that.\u2028Similarly, it does not tells the reader who to do if you are repenting or have repented. Yes, there is a need to repent, but after I\u2019ve done it, what should I do? Maybe the reader should move on to his other book, Not a Fan? But I think that would not be a good follow up. Maybe an additional chapter on basic discipleship would be extremely helpful to such new believers.This book would therefore be most suitable for nominal christians, or christians who are estranged from their christian roots. Read, realise and act, before it\u2019s too late.Rating: 4 / 5"}, {"userName": "A.C.

According to pastor and bestselling author Kyle Idleman, we can experience this same kind of \"aha!\" in our spiritual lives. With everyday examples and trademark testimonies, Idleman draws on Scripture to reveal how three key elements can draw us closer to God and change our lives for good.Awakening to the reality of our true spiritual condition, we see ourselves and our need for a Savior with renewed honesty. This realization leads to action, obeying God's commands and following the example set by Christ. As we see in the transformation of the prodigal son, the result is a life-changing, destiny-altering collision\u2014an AHA moment that leads us home to our loving Father.\u201dAHA! At first I thought what an odd name for a book. But after reading it, I thought what an appropriate name for this book. This book is filled with just that\u2026 the AHA moment. Based on the parable of the prodigal son, this book looks at the AHA moments of not only the prodigal, but the brother as well. Mr. Idleman then takes us through those moments in our lives when we \u201cA\u201d Awaken, get \u201cH\u201d Honest and take \u201cA\u201d Action. Perhaps our own life journey has veered off course a bit and you are wandering in The Distant Country. This book will give you a fresh perspective to see your own AHA moment in that journey and find your way back to the heart of your loving Father God. Just as the prodigals\u2019 father, He is waiting for you just to turn and He too will be there to celebrate you.In my opinion, this is not a book that is meant to be read once and relegated to the book shelf. This is a book that should be read\u2026 pondered\u2026 and then read and studied. I highly recommend it\u2026 you will not be disappointed.Visit the author\u2019s website: http://kyleidleman.com/*Disclaimer: I did not receive this book from any publishing company.

Describing the experience of being in the distant country, (this Distant Country can be defined as any area of our lives that we have walked away from God) and then coming to his senses.What drives many travelers to the Distant country is that they are running from a god that doesn\u2019t exist. Kyle goes on to discuss that for one reason or another, their perception of God doesn\u2019t match up with reality. They are rejecting a god they created and not the true God who created them.The prodigal son and his perception of what it would be like without his dad but only with his money was not correct. The son still chose to leave and do it his way. Sooner or later living in the distant country the alarm will begin to sound saying stop, turn around, change, get up and to of here. Too often we do like the prodigal did, we ignore it. The prodigal son in Luke 15 didn\u2019t hear the alarm until the pig pen.- Didn\u2019t hear while he made his request to his father asking for his share of the inheritance.- Didn\u2019t hear as his wallet became thinner and thinner while in the Distant country.- Didn\u2019t hear it while a famine swept through the land.- Didn\u2019t hear it while he took the job of a pig sitter.He continued to hit snooze. God will allow us to experience a sampling of what we can expect if we don\u2019t wake up.Grab this book and read the painful but extremely encouraging and hopeful adventure as Kyle lays it out in everyday language and examples with scripture to prove it.In closing, I enjoy the most where Kyle points out: \u201cWe expect God to be an angry father who demands justice, but through Jesus, He gives us love and grace when we don\u2019t deserve it. Ultimately, the story in Luke 15 isn\u2019t about two sons who disobey. It is about a Father who loves His children unconditionally.\u201dHow would your life be different if you woke up when God sounds the first alarm?"}, {"userName": "Caleb Coy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44467177-caleb-coy", "userReview": "ue to my previous reading, I approahced Kyle Idleman\u2019s AHA with a little skepticism. However, his was not a formula meant to be followed, but rather an observation of patterns that were meaningful. According to Idle, three elements are necessary for radical change in our lives:AwakeningHonestyActionUsing the Prodigal Son as his main reference, Idleman outlines how radical changes in our lives are possible when we realize, accept, and act on what needs to change. In Idleman\u2019s vocabulary, aha is a word, meaning \u201ca sudden recognition that leads to an honest moment that brings lasting change.\u201d Perhaps the most helpful aspect of his book is taken from his interactions as a teacher and listener. He gives numerous examples of people today who have shared their AHA moments, as well as from scripture.Sprinkled throughout are short anecdotes and examples of moments that may catch your eye, relating you to a situation you may be in\u2014cooking the books for a boss, plagiarizing a paper, losing your temper, showing disrespect to a spouse, viewing pornography, dating someone who discourages your faith.One flaw of the book is that although it speaks of the importance of our actions, it does not include much about the work of God\u2019s grace in our hearts.Another weakness may be that his Bible-derived formula does not work in every situation. Sometimes, change happens at a slow rate, over time. Nonetheless, AHA can serve as an insightful call for Christians to wake up to the change that needs to take place in their lives, a good book worth reading for a small group or for an individual."}, {"userName": "Beyond the Pages", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4609870-beyond-the-pages", "userReview": "AHA by Kyle Idleman is quite a remarkable book. It is a beautiful, simple, Scripture-rich work that discusses those special aha moments that exist in each of our lives. Written with a clear and highly conversational tone, Mr. Idleman did a superb job of identifying what it takes to get to and to appreciate the aha. He generally spoke through the perspective of the prodigal son, offering glimpses of where the aha existed within his life, but he did not shy away from providing other biblical examples of the epiphanous aha moment.Mr. Idleman's efforts to communicate the prodigal's lessons and show how those lessons translate to us today were spot on, in my estimation. He spoke of the value of having friends and supports who are courageous enough to help one see the aha. He also spoke on the significance of silence, solitude and surrender. He spoke of grace and suffering, as well as love and revelation. He spoke of how to take an action step forward. It all came together magnificently.I loved the constant encouragement written on the pages of this book. I loved the life story examples and the Bible references sprinkled throughout. I thought the message was timely and just right for spiritual growth.The more I read of this book, the more I wanted to read. I certainly want a hard copy of it for my personal library.

That's no reflection on the quality of the content, I just couldn't get to the book for a while. Which is going to make reviewing this a little more challenging than I'm used to. It doesn't usually take me over 2 months to finish this kind of book, so I'm having trouble remembering my reactions to the first half.Overall, AHA describes that process God takes us through to get us back to where He wants for us to be. It involves awakening to whatever issue has driven a wedge between us and God (and sometimes others too), a decision to change, and then acting on that. Idleman uses the parable of the prodigal son and real life situations to illustrate each step of the process. I picked this book up because I heard it was kind of a sequel to Gods at War which I found an excellent read. This book turned out to be a good one for a spiritual health checkup, but I didn't find it quite as powerful as Gods at War (though that may also be because of the glitches mentioned above). Idleman's writing is definitely easy to read and equally easy to grasp what he's trying to convey. Several teen students have checked out the student version of this from the library where I work and have liked that edition too. So it was good. Idleman makes some excellent points, and it does prove to be a catalyst for introspection and evaluation.

Or at least Idleman asserts. There are plenty of reviewers that have tackled this very question. Additionally, I'm not reviewing the book, but rather the audiobook. When reviewing an audiobook, the purpose of the review is to ascertain if the audio is one worth listening to. So, on my end, I will assume that you will have decided on the content material, but now you are at a point where you need to decide on traditional reading format or auditory listening format.Heyborne's narration is clear and easy to understand. He reads at a medium pace and pauses slightly in-between sentences to allow readers to keep up. A softer voice, Heyborne's is not one I would mind listening to in the background or while on a drive. Overall, the audiobook edition is a quality edition to consider, breaking out of the mold of subpar quality and providing a voice that can match the author's intent. So, if you're on the fence on reading versus listening, this title is a good title to give audiobooks a go.Disclosure: I was contracted to write an honest review in exchange for a reviewer copy of the product.

Months before the book was available to the public, Idleman released the first chapter as a free download, I devoured the pages and was desperate to read the rest, they were incredible.Unfortunately, I had no idea that the first chapter summarizes rather perfectly the book in it's entirety.Unlike the books of his writing past, there are not thrilling new thoughts on every page, even for a younger christian this book would not expound on the prodigal son much more than one would already be aware of.The format of the writing style even seems different than his precious attempts, and I found myself bored at times.However, being the least of his trilogy of works, it is a decent book on the prodigal son. But nothing deeper here.
