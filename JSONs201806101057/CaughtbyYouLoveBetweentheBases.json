This is Mike and Donna\u2019s book. We see the potential sparks between these two in All of Me the previous book. So it was fun seeing more to their relationship. It starts off with seeing their chemistry and Mike is pretty determined in winning Donna over. But she is keeping a secret from him. Donna is attempting to gain her son back, who was taken from her when he was born. But she has always wanted her son and is trying to change so that she can be a good mother for her son. The last thing she needs is to enter into a sexual affair with the well known catcher of the CatFish team. Her ex and his wife are trying to take her son fully away from her and she is planning on doing whatever it takes to gain back her son. But plans can go awry when she ends up taking Mike\u2019s marriage proposal. Not the most romantic\u2026but practical and if it can work towards getting her son back\u2026.she will do it. But then the worst happens and Donna may lose her son if she doesn\u2019t find another way to convince the judge of the truth.Caught By You was such a wonderful romance and I had a blast with Mike and Donna. This isn\u2019t the most convential romance and I really liked the whole marriage twist. Even though their intentions is to be practical, we also see how much these two care for each other. They haven\u2019t admitted how deep those feelings go\u2026but if they are willing to enter a marriage together, I respect it and I even liked the way the story develops into twist and heartbreaking turns. There is quite a high emotional element that brought tears to my eyes. There is a portion to this story that just about broke my heart but it also creates true depth of character and motivation to do what it takes. These two are simply wonderful together and it was a fun ride seeing Mike and Donna. Caught By You is a charming and engaging story that will make you laugh\u2026.shed some tears and make you smile in the end. A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY!!"}, {"userName": "Wendy Keel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1100558-wendy-keel", "userReview": "*I received this book in exchange for an HONEST review from Edelweiss.*This is book two in Jennifer Bernard's Love Between the Bases series. The first book All of Me, introduces you to the town, the characters, and to life with the Kilby Catfish. With this one we get a closer, more in depth look at Mike and Donna and their romance. I will say that while you can read this one without having read book one, I think you feel closer to all the characters if you start with book one, All of Me. Now for Caught By You we have Donna, a woman who is struggling with who she is and who she needs to be. Then you have Mike a baseball player who knows what or rather who he wants and while he's sworn off of Love he can't seem to help how he feels about Donna. I have to say I read this one in one night, I did NOT want to put it down. I do plan to do a reread once the book is out, as I've been honored to read it early. Fans of Baseball romance will love this whole series and with each book we get a better look at all the players on the Kilby Catfish, the more I read the more I want them all to have their own story! You will quickly fall in love with Mike and cheer him and Donna on. I loved the way the characters interacted and played with each other. I loved the setting, a small town, being from one all my life I can relate. *Honestly their town is bigger than my own!* So I felt right at home. Caught By You offers readers heat, romance, fun, and several sigh worthy moments. There are times you'll be touched by events, times you'll want to laugh out loud, and times you'll just sigh, but through it all you'll be smiling and eager to turn the page. I highly recommend this one to all fans of Susan Mallery, Jill Shalvis,Sheryl Woods, Robyn Carr,........ You'll be sure to laugh and sigh over Caught By You and be just as eager as me to get your hands on book three......Another winner from Jennifer Bernard! Highly Recommended!"}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3085379-danielle", "userReview": "This is the second book in the Love Between the Bases series and I absolutely loved it. Bernard filled the pages with humor and heartache. One thing I loved about this book was the humor. It seems like for most of the book I couldn't stop laughing at Donna and Mikes interactions. Although these two didn't start out in a relationship you could see they were perfectly matched and understood one another. This book also was very emotional which I thought balanced out the humor well. You get to see a single mother fighting for custody of her 4 year and the death of Mikes brother. If I wasn't laughing in this book I was tearing up. Of course in every book you have characters you love and then the ones you can't stand but I love how Bernard made each of them important so that story made sense. I wish this book had more pranks from the guys but Donna made up with it from her hilarious allergies to corn tortillas that made her get turned on, flowers that made her sneeze, chocolate and making Mike watch frozen over and over. In many sports romance books sometimes authors skip the playing time of the sport the hero plays but not Bernard. In this book the hero actually plays baseball! Yippee! I am really looking forward to reading more of this series. Although this is only the second book I see many more books in the future and more catfish players falling in love. We got a lot more Trevor in this book so I am hoping his book will be next without Bonita being his heroine. If you love baseball and hot players as much as I do this is the book for you!"}, {"userName": "Ellen Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23972290-ellen-anderson", "userReview": "What a wonderful story!!! Mike Solo is the catcher for the Kilby Catfish and Donna MacIntyre, a woman who has always been considered a party girl, come together in this book for a couple of reasons, besides mutual attraction. I don't want to say more and give away any spoilers. I will say that Jennifer Bernard brought out a topic that unfortunately still remains a problem in society today. Hopefully one day we will all be able to accept each other for who we are and no other reason. This story was told with a lot of humor and tears. I very much enjoyed it!

But an incident occurred the previous summer, which stopped Mike and Donna from taking their relationship further.Fast forward to the new baseball season, Mike is back as the catcher for Kilby Catfish. He once again takes his vow of celibacy for the season, but he might change his mind when he sees Donna. She's different than the last time. New clothes, new job. It throws him off guard. Then, he finds out she has a son. Without giving too much away since this book hasn't been released yet, I really enjoyed Mike and Donna.

These Kilby Catfish players have a way of catching your eye and grabbing your heart and Mike Solo definitely does that. He certainly caught Donna McIntyre's eye but he's a complication she can't afford right now. In the fight of her life to get her son back, every step she takes has to be precise and planned. No way does Mike fit into her plan. Too bad he's not willing to accept that and calls for her inner bad girl to come out and play every chance he gets. The cost is too high though.

One great thing about her books, and this one especially is that there\u2019s always a story where it is everyday life and love, but in this case it shows how the everyday decisions we might make, or those we might make thoughtlessly, can have a real impact on the lives of others. Another big issue is using others as either an excuse or a ladder. Jennifer doesn\u2019t use these themes pedantically, rather as I read, I just began thinking about what the actions and dialog in the book really meant. In between my life lessons I got to read about an incredibly hot relationship.In between, Jenn takes om some really tough and tragic issues \u2013 serious weepers. And, she does it well. The plotting is clever; justifying events with commensurate causes.So, I really loved Mike\u2019s and Donna\u2019s story \u2013 two people in crises who manage to work through their issues. They work through the issues through communicating with others and each other! What a surprise!!An interesting thing in the series is the development of the personality and situations around the team\u2019s owner, Crush Taylor. He is a shaky bedrock but he\u2019s there for his players: a fallible fixture.Mike Solo is an awesome character: a modern day Jamie Fraser. Mike does the right thing, not the easy thing. He is the loyal type, the family guy, the guy who takes responsibility for his actions and the consequences. Mike loves his brother, but has a tough time with his parents who don\u2019t accept his parents who reject the brother because he is gay. Through MIke\u2019s loyalty and steadfastness, and maybe a few moves in and out of the bedroom, Donna gains the strength she needs.I really enjoyed this entry in the BETWEEN THE BASES series. And it comes out at midnight!"}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963725-terri", "userReview": "Review also found at http://kristineandterri.blogspot.ca/2...3.5 starsI received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher HarperCollins via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. The expected publication date is December 29th, 2015. Bernard is not a new author to me. I read one of her stories in another series quite some time ago and enjoyed it. I thought it was time to read another one of her stories to see if I still felt the same. This one focused around baseball players instead of firefighters. This story is the second in the series however can be read as a stand alone. I will warn that there are quite a few references to the first story so you may want to read in order. That being said, it did not make this one hard to understand, more so made me curious about what happened in the first story. What the Jeter? This story was full of funny moments. Not the least of which was the use of what the Jeter. This sounded like something my friends and I would do and had me in stiches. I also liked that Donna was spunky and a jokester. The way she tried to curb her need to joke and have fun but simply couldn't stem that side of her personality. Mike himself wasn't so bad. All hot and dreamy and of course as is the case most of the time, the kind of guy every girl dreams off physically and emotionally. As is also standard in these stories is the hot and heavy scenes between the two. I almost started counting the number of closets the two got in to as it seemed to be a habit of theirs!  Althogether this was a good read. It delivered on the romance and steam all in one. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre. Random thought: I noticed in this story that the characters had nicknames for each other. He called her Red and she called him Solo. I kept waiting for Cup to be introduced. Anyone have the song in their head now?

Readers were introduced to both Mike Solo and Donna MacIntyre in the first book and I was glad to see the best friends of the previous book's main characters finally getting their shot at happily-ever-after. My heart went out to both of them, especially since all Donna wanted was to be the best kind of mother to her soon, and Mike simply wanted his brother to be happy and healthy and accepted by everyone else. I shed a tear for these two at a couple of points in the story, but it's not an entirely sad read, especially with the banter Mike and Donna engage in regularly.

I would have loved the book and rated it higher if it had been missing some of the drama. There's just a lot a lot going on in this plot line and with all of the backstory and branches, it felt like a bit too much. Obviously there was need for conflict, but I'm not sure it needed all of the things that were put in. Overall, a fairly quick read that I mostly enjoyed.

The hero is Mike Solo, the catcher for the Kilby Catfish, a triple A baseball team. The heroine is Donna MacIntyre who is battling her ex-boyfriend, Harvey, and his fianc\u00e9, Bonita, for custody for her son. We met Mike and Donna in Ms. Bernard\u2019s first book, All of Me where these two also met and flirted, at the Roadhouse bar in Kilby, Texas.Donna will do anything to gain full custody of her son, Zach including changing jobs, the way she dresses and acts. Due to complications from her pregnancy, Zach was placed with Harvey\u2019s parents and Donna had visitation rights. Enter Bonita who decided she wanted Zach to be with her and Harvey. Bonita uses the Wade influence to stack the trial against Donna.Enter Mike Solo who only has eyes for Donna. Mike takes a vow of celibacy each season which interferes with his pursuit of Donna. After hearing Donna\u2019s story, he decides to be the hero and help her to gain custody. It didn\u2019t hurt that he became involved after a picture of him kissing Donna was taken by Bonita after stalking them to get evidence of Donna not being competent. Mike decided that they needed to get engaged in order to help her case.Donna already had a crush on Mike, so this engagement could make her vulnerable. Mike swore he would never fall in love after an ill-fated relationship with his childhood sweetheart. This engagement actually becomes more than just doing the right thing. Mike has discovered a passion that focuses all of his emotions into play and a woman he would go to bat for again and again. I loved the way Ms. Bernard brought humor and sexy into this story. She also allowed for the growth of the relationship between these two characters as well as learning how to express their emotions and feelings for each other. I also appreciated Mike\u2019s attempt to help Donna out of this difficult situation. He was instrumental in getting a new trial for Donna, bringing in character witness as well as all of the people who love and support Donna in her fight for Zach.

Why? In book one there was some serious spark between Mike and Donna, and I was excited to learn that book 2 of the Love Between the Bases series was going to be their story!In the first book we didn\u2019t get to know much about Mike and Donna, but they did exchange plenty of playful banter. I could just feel that the chemistry between these two would be intense if they ever got together. Mike Solo is the Kilby Catfish catcher who adheres to a self-imposed vow of celibacy during the baseball season. Can he resist the temptation of the sassy redhead that is Donna MacIntyre? I love that Jennifer Bernard teases us a little in chapter 1. The tension is deliciously sweet and leaves you immediately wanting to read more.Mike and Donna both have things going on in their lives that are tough road bumps to overcome; however these two will make you root for them from the start. Primarily, Mike really wants to help Donna in her fight for custody of her son, so he comes up with a pretty wild idea. Who doesn\u2019t love a hero with such good intentions? When you find out what he\u2019s done in his past, you\u2019ll be smitten with Mike even more!I just adore how Jennifer Bernard weaves a story. I liked Caleb and Sadie from the first book, and we get nice updates on them, but I think I loved Mike and Donna\u2019s story a little more! Plus, I was so curious to see how things would go with Mike\u2019s vow of celibacy possibly getting in the way. He takes the vow pretty seriously, and there are unexpected twists! Filled with on-field action, heart, steam, and even surprising, funny scenes, Caught by You will make you laugh and cry in a very good way."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10367112-michelle", "userReview": "Calling romance fans...

He is engaged to one of the Wades, the local power family who run the town. Donna is fun-loving, tough, and independent. She is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone for her son. So, of course, that included her relationship with Mike. I guess it just felt like she was too much a victim. It was hard to imagine that they even had a chance of finding love.
