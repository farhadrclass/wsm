I go through the alphabet thinking of novelists I have read. Men first, then women and then, if it is a really bad night, children's authors. Most letters i have no problem with but 'Q', now that is always a struggle. So I hit upon a cunning plan. Going to the Cinema bookshop, an enormous, cavernous place with endless bookcases and shelves stretching over two floors I decided to find a couple of Q's. Paul Quarrington, of whom I had never heard, was one and this was the book i bought. A lovely first edition from 1987, although yet again the GR librarians declare its ISBN as being from a 1988 edition. WRONG !! But the mechanism for changing and challenging seems so unwieldy that i can't be arsed.Now you know why I picked up the book you may be interested as to what it was like. Excellent. That is what it is. It is funny and poignant and enraging and bizarre and unsettling and, most especially, Quarrington respects his readers. By that i mean he does not spoon feed his story all the time, he demands that we listen and concentrate and think. He doesn't signal every joke with huge unsubtle arrowing but will sometimes leave one ticking away in the narrative and it is only two or three pages later that the pay-off will explode in the paragraph and the cleverness of development becomes clear.The story is related by an old man living in residential care. He was a top ice hockey player and he tells, through flashback and encounters in his mind with long dead friends, his adventures and misadventures. We see everything through his eyes and as the story develops he becomes, quite clearly, an unreliable narrator. Not so much because he is untruthful but because he is blind to aspects of life which did not fit in with his plan or understanding. Gradually, more and more of the hinterland of the story is explored or, if you will, the pencil sketches he has drawn of others' lives are gradually given shade and depth and perspective and this comes through encounters with his 'fallen comrades' arriving like Banquo's ghost to chaallenge the equilibrium of his old age. Quarrington has a lovely ability to describe the natural world Sometimes the canal would be whitecapped and rough, and I wouldn't think the wind was up and blowing over a storm, I'd think the water was angry. Or sometimes it would be gentle, with little pieces of sunlight bouncing on it and i knew that the canal was happy and that if i went swimming the water would play on my bodyor warfare  It was like God slapped the world with the flat of His hand> The ridge started screaming The sun and wind are staging a major coup, trying to replace the stubborn winter with fragile springHe is great with one-linersthe reason he isn't dead yet is that even the Grim reaper has some pride Blue Hermann got some of his best diseases in TorontoThey were Church people and their basic idea was - you are a piece of dung but God is willing to helpThe man can't carry a tune in a suitcaseI particularly liked Quarrington's take on one of my favourite slang expressions. In England, if something is excellent, someone might say 'That is the dog's bollocks', Quarrington has his hero sayingIts the puppy's buttFor some reason this, as they say, really tickled my fancy.Anyway the book is a moving exploration of friendship and how this can blind us to truth, of ambition and how this can allow us to betray friendship and of how destructive our words can be. How their knock on effect can resound a long while after they have stopped being shouted or spoken or even whispered. Quarrington does all this without letting up on the humour. Gallows humour I suppose it could be called but it creates an atmosphere in the narrative which unnerves. At the heart of the novel is the relationship of Leary, our narrator, and his two best friends, both now long dead. Gradually, piece by piece and detail by detail the true history of events unfolds. From early on in the novel Quarrington unsettles his reader. You know there is something lurking in the back story and as it dawns on you, you realize you knew it deep down all the time. His talent is that he makes us, his readers, discover this inevitable truth at the same time as Leary faces up to it. Its as if we are walking the journey with him. His unreliability as a narrator thus becomes the great strength of the novel. Leary is not a liar but a coward. He has fought against facing life because in facing it there would be, and indeed are, too many questions crying out for answers. The ghosts which rock his security are not wraiths from beyond the grave but his long buried conscience.This book is, to coin a phrase, 'the puppy's butt'."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1424859-bonnie", "userReview": "I am revising my review slightly, because when I last wrote, I was feeling \"under the weather\".

Notwithstanding that I haven't yet read the other 2008 Canada Reads candidates, I'm quite prepared to say King Leary should be \"la premier etoile\"!Percival \"King\" Leary is an old man (read \"one foot poised to kick it\") and former hockey legend. As I was reading I did wonder for a while whether he really was a legend \"in the books\" or whether the highlight reels existed only in his own mind because I suspect that almost every Canadian male is (or coulda been) a hockey legend. But it appears he really was \"King of the Ice\". We find out that he has been trotted out and honoured at the Gardens more than once and he is in the Hall of Fame.Now, however, he is confined to a nursing home reliving his glory days in his own mind and by spouting off to whomever will listen. One day though he is contacted by an ad agency who wants to feature King Leary in a ginger ale commercial and so we are off to Toronto with the King and his wacky entourage (his nurse, his ancient reporter roommate, his \"loser\" son and a couple of ghosts from the past) to relive those glory days.King Leary's adventure is both incredibly funny and incredibly sad. Lewd and bawdy, thoughtful and heartwarming. The King had his moments of glory, scoring winning goals, perfecting his signature move, moments in the sun. But of course there were costs and insults.As Canadians we know the history of our national sport, the drinking, carousing, corruption, the evolution of the game itself, the road trips, the trades, loyalties and loneliness, shame and glory. So all of Leary's memories ring very true.It is a hockey story but it is much more than that. It is also a story of redemption.Reserved for the Canada Day release challenge unless I can't help myself from foisting it on someone else as a \"must read\".I think it makes for a great Canada Reads book. I found myself reading into it all sorts of things that I have no idea whether the author intended (Clay Bors Clinton as our neighbour to the south for example). Right or wrong, thought provoking."}, {"userName": "Cort", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/345103-cort", "userReview": "This book was chosen as the 2008 \"Canada Reads\" selection. Each year, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation invites four or five noteworthy figures from Canadian arts and letters to nominate a favorite book, the only rule being that the volume must reflect Canadian culture and values. The merits of each book are debated, often quite vigorously, in a series of radio programs, until one is selected that year's Canada Reads winner. The goal is to have every citizen of the nation read the book, in hopes that it will generate discussion and debate, increasing the sense of community in the nation. Can you imagine, millions of people earnestly talking about a book?I know, we already have this. But I ain't interested in reading what Oprah tells me to read. And sure, sure, the selection process might sound like The Final Four for nerds, but it beats \"American Idol\".And yes, what I am saying is that things are better in Canada, and that Americans are a bunch of lazy, intellectually atrophied cementheads. Want more evidence? I give you \"The Family Guy\".Anyway, the book. It's a remarkable effort, in turns hilarious and heartbreaking. Percival \"King\" Leary is an octogenarian ex-hockey star, nearing death and haunted, albeit gently, by the ghosts of his past. There are plenty of \"King Lear\" references, but the story also owes much to Thomas Berger's \"Little Big Man\" and the best of Mark Harris's baseball novels. That's high praise, indeed, but completely deserved. It's fun to pick at all the NHL references -- King Leary is based in part on Clarence \"King\" Clancy, Manny Oz is clearly references the tragic Busher Jackson, and Clay Clinton seems to be an amalgam of Conn Smythe and Harold Ballard -- but the power of the book is its messages: those who set their hearts on worldly things end up broken- hearted; no guilt is more searing that the guilt of having betrayed a loved one; forgiveness transcends time; and love is a powerful thing, indeed.Plus, the word \"gormless\" is used about 57 times. How can you dislike a book that makes such liberal use of such a great word?"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2673816-jen", "userReview": "Full of blarney, spit and spunk, and often drunk on ginger ale, Percival Leary was the king of the ice in his heyday, captain of the Ottawa Patriots, trained by monks and fearless in the rink.

Yes it has wit and humour, but it is mostly the meditation of an elderly man on his life; the good, the bad, his adventures and friends, all set against the quintessential Canadian backdrop of hockey.Percival \"King\" Leary is a great character and is drawn vividly by Quarrington. His unique voice never wavers throughout the book. King reminisces about his life and his hockey career, and begins to see things more clearly, leading to some peace and reconciliation as he knows his life is coming to an end. A strong theme in the book is alcoholism, which affects many of King's family and friends. How King comes to term with the effect alcohol has had on his life is a central part of the story. The book reminds me of the 1951 film Scrooge (based on Dickens of course), wherein Scrooge is visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. So is King visited by the ghosts of his friends Clay and Manny, and his son Clarence, who help him understand that things were not always as they appreared, and allow him to make some healing choices. Some of the best scenes in the book involve the four monks, who taught King and Manny about life and hockey when they attended the Bowmanville Reformatory. The monks are unique characters that come and go from the narrative at key points. They add a touch of humour and spirituality to the story.This is a well rounded book. Although it has some elements of magical realism, overall it feels like a true and essentially Canadian story-hockey and friendship-with a little ginger ale thrown in for good measure.Canada Reads winner 2008"}, {"userName": "Arlene Richards", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2084068-arlene-richards", "userReview": "A story about hockey, booze, and sex - an old man being recognized for his greatness as a hockey player and the same old man trying to right his past wrong doings."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23873887-linda", "userReview": "I now understand my mother's love of Ginger Ale."}, {"userName": "Marni", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13517228-marni", "userReview": "A story about an old-time hockey player written as if he's telling it.

King Leary is a fiction novel placed in Toronto, and a fictional town named South Grouse. The Canadian author Paul Quarrington got the idea of the main character and dedicated the novel on a page before it starts to a former NHL player in the early 1900\u2019s named Francis Michael Clancy (Quarrington). There are many similarities between the main Character Percival \u201cKing\u201d Leary and Francis \u201cKing\u201d Clancy. Percival is Irish as is Clancy and the author borrowed the nickname \u201cKing\u201d from Clancy. They also share the same birth place of Ottawa.The novel is first person set in the early 1900\u2019s. The reader is informed through the eyes of Percival Leary. This creates bias as other characters and the plot are seen and interpreted through his eyes. His best friend Manfred Ozikean is portrayed as a sorry no good drunk for the first part of the book. This is due to the first person narration and the bias that is caused by the narration style. The genre of this book is humour and this humour perfectly targets the authors audience of a hockey fan. The author creates humour through Percival Leary, in both the way he talks about hockey and in the way he talks with his Irish tongue. For someone like me who is both Irish and a huge hockey fan, he perfectly hit the right humour spots. I found myself constantly laughing at all of the good hockey humour throughout the book. The author created names for the teams such as the Toronto Maple \u201cLeaves\u201d instead of \u201cLeafs\u201d. Also, the words he used for dekeing, such as the St Louis Whirligig were a perfect way to include comedy into this novel. The Irish comedy for some will be a bonus as \u201cKing\u201d Leary would describe people as \u201cMooks\u201d and other names. The comedy could not have been done any better by Quarrington. Flashbacks were a large part of the novel and they were used extremely well by the author. Quarrington uses flashback stories to help develop characters, plot, and themes. The development of characters through these flashbacks is very important to the story and to a major theme in the book of appearance vs reality. It is perceived by the reader that \u201cKing\u201d Leary is the king of the ice. Repetition, which is another rhetorical device is used to help drive the point home that Percival Leary is the \u201cKing\u201d. However, as the novel progresses and there are more and more flashbacks, the reader learns that \u201cKing\u201d Leary is not the true king of the ice. The flashbacks develop the characters of Percival Leary and Manfred Ozikean in such a way that you see Manfred is the true king of the ice and not Percival. That is where the illusion vs reality lies. It is believed that Leary is the king of the ice when in fact he is not.Another major theme in this novel that is well portrayed by Quarrington is selfishness. Percival Leary was a very selfish man. He recounts on that through the flashbacks. He did not help his friend Manfred to stop drinking, and he even traded him away just so he could be \u201cKing\u201d of the ice. Percival near the end of the novel sees what he has done in the past. He does what he can to get Manfred into the Canadian Hall of Fame and he tells his son to stop drinking. He does this because he regrets not telling Manfred that. He has a change of heart and shows selflessness. Many other professional hockey players like Percival go through similar emotional struggles. Percival is in a constant struggle with his own thoughts and emotions. Jordin Tootoo a former pro hockey player went through similar struggles. The stories are different however one of the things that Jordin battled is substance abuse, which is also a large part of the novel King Leary. Jordin has been able to overcome it with help and says that it was one of the best decisions of his life. Percival had the ability to help his friend but did not. He tries to make up for what he did and to act selfless instead of selfish. The novel King Leary by Quarrington is a fantastic book and every Canadian should read it. Quarrington uses the genre of comedy perfectly and he brilliantly uses rhetorical devices to help enhance and develop characters, plot and theme. There are not enough good things that I could say about this novel. King Leary is a must read and is a true work of art. Work Cited:Quarrington, Paul. King Leary. Canada: Anchor Canada, 2007.

This lively tale is the first-person narration of Percival \"King\" Leary, former hockey legend and now \"ag\u00e8d and infirm\" resident of a seniors' home, soon to be the star of a ginger ale commercial. Along the way he tells his life story, with his memories of the past intruding upon the present. Hilarity ensues.I knew I would get along splendidly with this book for two reasons: one of Leary's teams is called the Toronto Maple Leaves, and when I opened the book to slip in the library due date receipt, the page I landed upon began with a loud burp, rendered most elegantly by Quarrington's onomatopoeia. I am secretly five years old in the humour department, so onomatopoeic burps and statements like this caused me to make very undignified faces on the bus as I tried not to laugh out loud:\"...ginger ale is the boy for me. It's sweet and bubbly and makes your toenails curl. If you down a whole can, you can belch in a truly horrifying way, like a dragon about to eat a maiden.\" (p. 3)Leary's narrative keeps the reader moving along and chuckling throughout, perhaps laughing out loud if an observation or just plain bizarre scene catches you off-guard. It also kind of reminded me of the narrator of Barney's Version, by Mordecai Richler, except the chronology is easier to follow and there are no footnotes. But if you liked that book you might enjoy this one, especially if you're a hockey fan as well, as I'm sure there are other references I missed in the text. But even if you're not a hockey fan, the cast of characters is quite lively, and the narrator charming in a older-fella-who-can-say-what-he-wants kind of way.

Let's say it's impressionistic rather than realistic.Told in the first person by \"King\" Leary, a former hockey player and current nursing home resident, it is both the story of his early life--encompassing childhood, a stay at a Catholic reform school for boys, and hockey fame; and his current life--in which he comes to terms with (and indeed seems to consider for the first time ever) his relationships, notably with boyhood friend and fellow hockey player, the late Manfred Armstrong Ozikean. I'm not sure how many of them are caused by hockey head injuries (a subject I really shouldn't be joking about in this day and age), but King Leary is full of hallucinatory (or not?) scenes of hockey-induced bloodletting, hockey-playing monks (including a blind monk hockey goalie), and, well, all kinds of other crazy scenes and observations. It's a fun if potentially confusing read. Ultimately, though, it is a story of one man's attempt, at the end of his life, to make amends for past wrongs.

The book uses flashbacks to sketch out his life (and the various colourful characters that inhabited it), while a story in the present-day revolves around his trip to Toronto to film a ginger ale commercial.What really struck me about the book is that it manages to be humourous and a little fanciful, and, at the same time, be rather sad and tragic. It's hard to explain without giving away the plot of the book, but suffice to say, the characters are pretty rich and interesting, while Quarrington's narrative is compelling and provides a few laugh-out-loud moments.Definitely recommended."}, {"userName": "Gloria", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9861665-gloria", "userReview": "Who knew Canada Dry ginger ale could make you drunk?

Nobody was impressed. Neither was I. Reading it was like being at a party where everyone there is drunk except you. It did provoke some discussion about hockey and its history. But I don't recommend it unless you are a hockey trivia fan.Lesson learned: you can't always expect reality radio to come up with the best (?)"}, {"userName": "Chris Cowie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28213048-chris-cowie", "userReview": "I read this book not long after it was written in the late 80s. At the time I didn't really like it all that much. After Quarrington's untimely death I decided to read his other books and loved them, particularly Whale Music. Boy, what a difference some time makes! I loved this book! In fact, I'd have to say it's the best hockey fiction I've read - better than The Good Body by Bill Gaston and way better than the over rated The Antagonist by Lynn Coady."}, {"userName": "Grumpylibrarian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/674012-grumpylibrarian", "userReview": "I read this because it won Canada Reads on CBC which, I should know by now, is a dubious honour. Canada Reads is a radio debate over several Canadian works of fiction, all of which are ok, but none of which ever appear to stand out in my mind. King Leary, obviously a play on Shakespeare, is a bland history of an aged former NHL star. I wouldn't say to avoid it, but there are certainly plenty of other, better Canadian novels to read in lieu of this."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/708948-jeff", "userReview": "I really enjoyed Quarrington's invented turn-of-the-century slang throughout King Leary. Little Leary's vocabulary is a mixture of 1920s excess, hockey goon, and egomaniac. Which is interesting for a character who seems to have no care what others think of him in his old age but for his title of King. While Quarrington's writing is unique, and the dialogue hilarious, the story is told in a bit of a heavy handed manner, where the last few chapters of the book seemed unnecessary."}], "description": "Percival Leary was once the King of the Ice, one of hockey's greatest heroes.\u00a0\u00a0In the South Grouse Nursing Home, where he shares a room with Edmund \"Blue\" Hermann, the antagonistic and alcoholic newspaper reporter who once chronicled his career, learly looks back on his tumultuous life and times:\u00a0\u00a0his days at the boys' reformatory when he burned down a house; the four mad monks who first taught him how to play hockey; and the time he executed the perfect \"St. Louis Whirlygig\" to score the winning goal in the 1919 Stanley Cup finals.\u00a0\u00a0 Now all but forgotten, Leary is only a legend in his own mind until a high-powered advertising agency decides to feature him in a series of ginger ale commercials.\u00a0\u00a0With his male nurse, his son, and the irrepressible Blue, Leary sets off for Toronto on one last madcap adventure as he revisits scenes of his glorious life as the King of the Ice.From the Trade Paperback edition.", "title": "King Leary", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1411797.King_Leary", "average": 3.5, "cover": "", "reviews": 72, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/159637.Paul_Quarrington", "name": "Paul Quarrington"}], "type": ["Cultural", "Fiction", "Sports and Games", "Sports"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1411797.King_Leary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/978418.King_Leary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2322130.King_Leary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1411796.King_Leary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/646887.Whale_Music", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1160586.Galveston", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1411801.The_Ravine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1411786.Home_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2168390.The_Spirit_Cabinet"]}
