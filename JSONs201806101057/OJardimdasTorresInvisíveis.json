Only by reading does a clearer image, deeper understanding and the realization of human universal truths emerge. \"A Fort of Nine Towers: An Afghan Family Story\" by Qais Akbar Omar is one of the most powerful books I've read in years. Definitely my top book for 2013 and one that I will recommend to everyone. Omar's memoir of his family's passage through decades of civil war and unimaginable horrors was one of the most hopeful and life affirming books I have ever read. Yes, horrible tragedy occurs, but through it all the love and resilience of this family (or Afghan people) triumphs. I read this on my Nook but will buy the book and reread it so I can be reminded that behind the headlines live people that want all the same things we do...as this beautifully written book helps us understand."}, {"userName": "Simra S", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27535878-simra-s", "userReview": "\"I have long carried this load of griefs in the cage of my heart. Now I have given them to you. I hope you are strong enough to hold them.\"I give this book all the stars that are shining bright in the sky tonight.I am spellbound. I am stunned. I have no words to describe the grief this book holds. I bought this book because I am a huge Khaled Hosseini fan, and he loved it. I knew I had to buy this book, and within 48 hours I finished it and I am writing this review with tears still running down my cheeks. This is the writer, Qais Akbar Omar's real life story, his sufferings and the devastating war experience in Afghanistan. This is the first book on a true life memoir of growing up in the raging war zone of Afghanistan. A few times, I found myself smiling and crying at the same time because despite all the pain, the writer has managed to pen down his horrifying experiences in a way that is funny and sad at the same time. A Fort of Nine Towers is a lyrical, powerful and a harrowing memoir of one family and how the war shattered their lives.When the civil war started getting out of hands, an eleven year old Qais and his family set out to their aunt's house to escape the war, but a whole lot of life changing experiences were in the way, Qais and his family live like Kuchis (nomads), they live inside the head of a huge Buddha statue, he was bitten by a dog (one more human like dog bites him later), he meets a deaf woman who becomes his teacher and teaches him everything about weaving carpets. His grandfather's wise words, his friendship with Wakeel, the love and admiration he has for them is heart warming.Every word, every sentence of this book left me speechless. I can not for the life of me comprehend the mental and physical traumas they have endured. I could feel their pain, I cried when someone died. This is just one family's experience, it pains me to think about all the other families who have gone through similar pain and faced similar situations. I felt like I knew the characters personally, I could feel their grief. A must read book for everyone who loves to read, and for everyone who does not read. I want every single person on this earth to read this book to know what war could do to you, to know how much destruction a war could cause, to know how someone sleeps after being bombed several times a day, to know how to go on about life after coming face to face with death at least three times, to know how to not lose hope even though death was dancing around their heads every time of every day, to know how to live a righteous life after having been through years of transgression. I could go on about this book, but I will end it here, go buy this book and I promise you, you will be overwhelmed with countless emotions."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1029825-julie", "userReview": "\"I have long carried this load of griefs in the cage of my heart.

This chronicle is raw, powerful, emotional, detailed and beautifully told.I've read a LOT of fiction set in Afghanistan over the years, so it has been quite an eye-opening experience for me to read this memoir and understand just how much of that fiction is strongly grounded in the reality of ordinary Afghani people, regardless of ethnicity or social/economic advantage.

Bez obzira na va\u0161 omiljeni \u017eanr; bez obzira da li ina\u010de preferirate trilere, ljubavne, \u0161pijunske ili koje god romane, ovo je posebna i \"jaka\" knjiga koja se mo\u017ee preporu\u010diti svima.I koju \u0107e svi, sigurna sam, sa u\u017eitkom \u010ditati od prve do posljednje stranice jer je \"Utvrda s devet kula\" jedna od (rijetkih) knjiga koje nas oboga\u0107uju na razne na\u010dine.Tako npr. kroz ovu knjigu u\u010dimo o, ne tako davnoj, povijesti Afganistana; ona nas navodi na razmi\u0161ljanje o va\u017enosti nekih stvari koje, naj\u010de\u0161\u0107e, uzimamo \"zdravo za gotovo\", a koje mogu preko no\u0107i nestati i/ili se promijeniti; \u010ditaju\u0107i je , tako\u0111er, uvi\u0111amo i koliko su zapravo va\u017ene spone me\u0111u ljudima koji nas okru\u017euju, prvenstveno obiteljske, a ponekad i one me\u0111u ljudima koji su, do odre\u0111enog trenutka, bili potpuni stranci.\u0160to se ti\u010de radnje, prvo moram istaknuti da je ovo istinita pri\u010da tj. autobiografija \u0161to, naravno, knjizi daje posebnu te\u017einu i vrijednost. Quias Akbar Omar, autor, u prvom nam licu prepri\u010dava svoje odrastanje u Afganistanu pogo\u0111enim gra\u0111anskim ratom u posljednjim godinama 20.st. Ono \u0161to je meni bilo jako va\u017eno i zbog \u010dega mi je, na neki na\u010din, bilo malo lak\u0161e \u010ditati ovu knjigu \u010dak i u dijelovima koji opisuju neke jako mu\u010dne i surove doga\u0111aje, je sam po\u010detak knjige u kojem nam autor, ukratko daje uvid u sada\u0161njost; u svoj \u017eivot i u \u017eivot njegovih roditelja kao i bra\u0107e i sestara po \u010demu shva\u0107amo da su oni pre\u017eivjeli te ratne doga\u0111aje o kojima \u0107emo \u010ditati. Nakon \u0161to su Sovjeti napustili Afganistan, sedmogodi\u0161nji Qais u\u017eiva u sretnom djetinjstvu u obitelji poduzetnika i intelektualaca, vi\u0161eg srednjeg sloja u Kabulu u trenutku kada zapo\u010dinje preko deset godina novih, ratnih strahota. Prvo dolaze \"sveti ratnici\"- mud\u017eahedini kojima se narod isprva veseli, no oni se ubrzo dijele u frakcije koje se bore za prevlast nad dijelovima Kabula; kasnije dolaze talibani.. Grad postaje nesiguran te se njegova, mnogobrojna obitelj seli u sigurniji dio grada, na imanje o\u010devog prijatelja u \"Utvrdu s devet kula\"po kojem je knjiga i dobila naziv. Nakon nekog vremena ratne strahote ponovno dolaze do njih te po\u010dinje putovanje malog Quiasa, i njegove naju\u017ee obitelji, po cijelom Afganistanu, a sve kako bi prona\u0161li barem malo mira u tim te\u0161kim, ratnim godinama. Na svom putovanju susre\u0107u razne ljude, od neznanaca koji im nesebi\u010dno pru\u017eaju pomo\u0107, preko nomada sa kojima, tako\u0111er, provode jedan dio vremena putuju\u0107i sa njihovom karavanom pa sve do osebujnih pojedinaca od kojih Quias slu\u0161a neobi\u010dne pri\u010de, pa \u010dak u\u010di i neke vje\u0161tine koje \u0107e njemu i obitelji pomo\u0107i u pre\u017eivljavanju.  U ovom romanu izmjenjuje se ono najgore i ono najbolje od \u010dovje\u010danstva. Iako ova afganistanska obitelj pro\u017eivljava najte\u017ee dane u svojim \u017eivotima, roman obiluje elokventnim i britkim razgovorima, mudrim mislima i narodnim predajama (posebno su lijepi razgovori Quaisa i njegovog djeda) pa \u010dak i humorom koji je, \u010desto, neophodan da bi se pro\u017eivjele situacije u kojima su ljudi nemo\u0107ni jer su doga\u0111anja oko njih potpuno izvan njihove kontrole.  Uprkos u\u017easnoj tragediji koja je zadesila Afganistan, u knjizi prevladava trijumf pozitive i ljubavi i to je ono \u0161to mi se najvi\u0161e svi\u0111a kod pisanja Quais Akbar Omara. U osvrtima na ovu knjige \u010desto se spominje Khaled Hosseini koji je bio i mentor autoru, a i sama radnja, smje\u0161tena u Afganistan, podsje\u0107a na Hosseinijeve knjige. Ali, za razliku od Hosseinijevih knjiga, koje su, apsolutno izvrsne, i kod kojih su (barem u mom slu\u010daju) suze neizbje\u017ene, uz ovu knjigu nisam plakala iako su i ovdje opisane mnoge te\u0161ke situacije.. Kao \u0161to sam prije navela, ton knjige je pozitivan pa to uvelike utje\u010de na do\u017eivljaj tijekom \u010ditanja, a bitna je razlika i to \u0161to su doga\u0111aji opisani u ovoj knjizi istiniti.  Nakon svih u\u017easa koje je pro\u017eivio Quais Akbar Omar danas je uspje\u0161an, poslovni \u010dovjek koji se bavi tepisima, koji su obiteljski posao i kojima je, tako\u0111er, protkana i ova pri\u010da. On nije izmi\u0161ljao junake svoje pri\u010de; junaci su on i njegova obitelj, prvenstveno njegov djed, majka i otac iako, kao \u0161to je i sam napisao u pogovoru, ovo je pri\u010da samo jedne afganistanske obitelji od mnogih koje je zadesila sli\u010dna (a \u010desto i te\u017ea) sudbina tijekom ratnih godina. Pa je stoga ova divna knjiga posve\u0107ena Afganistanu i njegovom narodu, svim tim \"neopjevanim\" herojima kao i afganistanskoj kulturi uz nadu da \u0107e, njezinim \u010ditanjem, ljudi malo bolje shvatiti tu napa\u0107enu zemlju o kojoj, na\u017ealost, ve\u0107ina nas, ima potpuno krivu predod\u017ebu.  Bilo je ovo jedno divno \u010ditala\u010dko iskustvo i, kao \u0161to sam napisala na po\u010detku, mislim da bi \"Utvrdu s devet kula\" trebali ba\u0161 svi pro\u010ditati."}, {"userName": "Helena (Renchi King)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17067875-helena-renchi-king", "userReview": "Od dizajna naslovnice do zadnje stranice-savr\u0161eno!Ovo je autobiografska knjiga Qais Akbar Omara,malog dje\u010daka iz Afganistana.Sad mi je jasna uzre\u010dica koja ka\u017ee da \"\u017eivot pi\u0161e najbolje romane\".Od bezbri\u017enog djetinjstva u velikoj,imu\u0107noj obitelji prodava\u010da sagova,do potpunog siroma\u0161tva i talibanske diktature,put je kojim je ovaj mladi \u010dovjek pro\u0161ao.Qais je bio znati\u017eeljan dje\u010dak, okru\u017een ljubavlju velike obitelji,bezbri\u017ean i zaokupljen igrom pu\u0161tanja zmajeva sa svojim ro\u0111akom ,na mnogobrojnim kabulskim krovovima.Ljubav i radost djetinjstva zamijenila su mnogobrojna neshva\u0107ena ratovanja Mud\u017eahedina,Rusa i Talibana.U\u017easno iskustvo za dje\u010daka koji ,odrastaju\u0107i u ratnim previranjima ,poku\u0161ava na\u0107i smisao svih tih strahota ,te spasiti sebe i obitelj.Vrlo gorke \u017eivotne lekcije,upornost i djedova mudrost koja mu je uvijek bila nevidljiva ruka vodilja,oblikovale su uspje\u0161nog poslovnog \u010dovjeka, koji nam prepri\u010dava ovu zanimljivu i istinitu pri\u010du.Kako i sam ka\u017ee,to je pri\u010da gotovo svakog Afganistanca,pri\u010da koju svijet treba upoznati.Zadivljuju\u0107a,mudra,puna ljubavi i po\u0161tovanja prema bli\u017enjima,pri\u010da zbog koje bi se mi zapadnjaci mogli i posramiti.Deset zvjezdica od mene!"}, {"userName": "Vivone Os", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17738522-vivone-os", "userReview": "KUMSKI BOOK CLUB READING CHALLENGE 2017 - 7(a book that is set in the Middle East)Kad sam po\u010dela \u010ditati ovu knjigu iskreno nije mi se svidjela. \u010cinila se kao i svaka druga knjiga koja opisuje \u017eivot u Afganistanu, a ja valjda nisam bila raspolo\u017eena za te teme.

Certainly, the United States is not perfect. We have our own sources of strife and political upheaval, but we can all pray to our respective deities that the horrors of Afghanistan have not yet found its way to our city streets on the scale that Afghanis face on a daily basis. When a trip to the store for milk means possibly never seeing one's family ever again, checking one's Facebook or Twitter status or catching the new Brad Pitt movie becomes increasingly insignificant.Sadly, for many Americans, Afghanistan burst onto the radar in a big way on Sept. 11, 2001. We all suddenly learned a lot more about Afghanistan that day, but it was unfortunately behind a filtered lens of retribution and anger. Many of us forgot (or chose to ignore) the fact that our war was not necessarily with the Afghani people but rather the backwards-thinking cave-dwelling militant fundamentalists led and financed by Osama bin Laden. Even the majority of Afghani citizens detested bin Laden and the group known as the Taliban.Qais Akbar Omar's beautifully written memoir \"A Fort of Nine Towers\" joins a steadily-growing oeuvre of literature about Afghanistan targeted toward American readers. Like Khaled Hosseini's novel \"The Kite Runner\", Qaisr's memoir is a personal account of his experience growing up in the tumultuous country of Afghanistan, and specifically the city of Kabul, made all the more powerful by the fact that it is non-fiction.Growing up, young Qais (it rhymes with \"rice\") saw the aftermath of the Russian invasion and the rise of the Mujahadin, a group of rebels who may have started with good intentions but quickly devolved into the killings and bombings for which it became notorious. Qais and his many siblings were forced to watch as family members and friends slowly left the country or were killed by sporadic bombings and gunfire. Qais's father, a well-to-do carpet seller, was forced out of business when his factory and shop were destroyed by a fire caused by a stray missile. The Omar family soon found themselves nomads, wandering the desert and going from city to city to find food and shelter.In later years, Qais watched as the fundamentalist group known as the Taliban (hated by most Afghanis as uneducated country folk) came to power and created strict laws that may have reduced crime but also increased misery. Imagine the Westboro Baptist Church taking over the U.S. government and instituting strict laws (everything from banning any non-Christian books or movies from libraries and schools, making homosexuality punishable by death, and forbidding women to leave the house), and you pretty much get the idea of what life was like in Afghanistan.The most striking thing about Qais's account is the love and familial bonds that kept the family going. Indeed, the charity and open arms that the Omar family encountered from distant relatives and even total strangers is what keeps the reader turning the pages and keeps the bleakness and utter despair of the family's situation from becoming too daunting."}, {"userName": "Mikey B.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b", "userReview": "This is a book of epic proportions.

In their travels they are met at times with overwhelming kindness from strangers who provide the author and his family (his parents with their five children \u2013 three girls and two boys) with shelter and nourishment.As conditions between the warring factions change they are forced to flee time and again to find some form of safety. For a time they reside in the Bamyan Buddha statues.Page 169 (my book)I had always expected I would see our Buddha again. But the storm of ignorance that has been raging in Afghanistan for so many decades smashed him to bits before I could return. I once lived inside his head. Now he lives in mine.And in this splintered country there is extreme brutality. There is no such place as a safety zone. The Taliban provide some measure of stability (no bombs are exploding), but women can only leave the home covered in a burqa and with a male escort. However everyone is afraid to leave the house for fear of transgressing a Taliban edict. The author, as a teenager, is savagely imprisoned for over a week due to his hair style. After the invasion in October 2001 Kabul residents are ecstatic, once again, to be able to listen to music which was forbidden by the Taliban. The author does not detail the years after 2001. This book is about the prior years. It is written with wonderful eloquence of the conversations and encounters in this most devastated on nations.

This is Qais detailing his life in Afghanistan from about 1992 until just recently. He is 10 at the beginning and his family lives in Kabul in his Grandfather's house/ compound. No further synopsis, just a reaction.Finally, I have some idea about the real crux of Afghanistan's instability and decades of war. Civil War prime actually, with more than just a couple of opponents is only one set of factors. And not based in just religious differences at all, but also in tribal, economic, cultural, mores and manners clash. Sounding like a beautiful physical environment in different climates, and filled with families of close attachment and dedication to blood connection- STILL, there is such uncertainty underpinning all. The journey that this family takes to stay together, stay alive, and try to leave Afghanistan itself- well, it is beyond my describing ability. Three steps backward for even one forward. Readers need strong stomach to get through times when Qais and his father get caught in different factions' nets. While trying to retrieve from their own former home yet. It's a memoir that purely glows with sharp eyes and poetic imagination within the most difficult of harrowing and impossible to foresee outcomes. This book was not recommended to me but found without any previewing or trailer read on the \"New\" shelf and taken without any idea that it would be this illuminating. This is a must read to Middle Eastern (Palestine, Syria, Libya absolutely) base conflict understanding, as well as Afghan War perception. It's not just from the outside in or ideologue movement, or faith based difference; it's far more complex.

His writing style is simple and beautiful, poetic at times. The tale that he tells of his familiy's survival adventures are amazing, horrifying, inspiring and unforgettable. His father and mother are nothing short of heroic. I always thought of Afghanistan as a violent, war torn country, but it is easy to forget that the majority of the people there, just like anywhere, just want to make a living, raise their families and live in peace.

Grade: B+Sitting in the comforts of our rooms, we feel that life is so tough. But there is an entire world out which lives on an entirely different plane \u2013 a world where people live in limitations, in a seemingly endless scarcity of resources. When such tales of despair come across, it surprises as well as pains the heart making it yearn for the one on the other side. But these tales also bring with them hope \u2013 a hope of human perseverance\u2019s victory against all odds, over all atrocities; a hope of someday seeing a better world. It is this hope that drives us as inhabitants of this planet to strive on. A Fort of Nine Towers is one such tale of hope.Since this is a non-fiction (almost) book, there is no question about the plot. But the writing is not amateurish, which is a very good thing. It so happens that in novels such as this, the narration becomes a rant or a description of pangs. The absence of this characteristic is the best thing about A Fort of Nine Towers.(extract) \u2018\u201cI\u2019m not a coward, but I am afraid of being killed by a coward\u201d\u2019It is such sentiments which are common probably to every single entity in a war-struck nation. Such emotions range across the populace but only after being ravaged by a war for so long. It is the kind of emotion that stems from the mental strength of people who feel that their religion, their beliefs are manipulated by some fanatics to satisfy their own ends \u2013 the mental strength derived from exploitation, the strength derived from the verity of one\u2019s beliefs.(ezxtract)\u2018\u201cIn a war, every man is needed, so he was sent here. But wicked people like him bring shame to us Hazaras and to the Mujahideen.\u201d\u2019It only seems fair for every coin to have two sides. The antagonism of the situation is only because of the method used, but the cause, in itself, probably stems from a genuine cause. However, for a victim to have acknowledged this other shows not only strength of character but the ability to have made peace with the events transpiring in one\u2019s life, that takes maturity of a different level altogether.(extract)\u2018Uncertainty hangs thick like the dust in the air.\u2019This was probably the strongest line in the entire novel \u2013 metaphor used to perfection.The only problem I found was with the character sketch. No doubt, that this is a non-fiction book piece; definitely the characters cannot be larger than life. Yet they can be created to reside in memories. This required some extra effort from the author, even more so because the narrative is non-fictional and from a first person perspective. The characters in this novel are sketched in what could probably be known as a weaker manner. Another issue would be that of connectivity to the reader. A major chunk of the details mentioned in the novel are of the nature that the reader might skim through them.The novel is not short \u2013 it\u2019s a 300-odd page novel. What such detailing or lengthening can do is make the reader lose interest at certain junctures while reading. Had it been a little more concise, it would have been much more impactful.(extract)\u2018Every Friday, the Muslim holy day when schools and businesses closed, we carried\u2026\u2019The more appropriate sentence would be when schools and businesses are closed or remain closed.To sum up, I\u2019d say Qais Akbar Omar, through A Fort of Nine Towers, sends one message \u2013 even in the darkest of times, life continues to teach one thing or the other. It is these experiences that build one\u2019s character.

Quais describes many of the atrocities he witnessed, yet he holds on to his love for his homeland and his family. Kites, rug weaving, and family love contrast with the brutal savagery of the fighting and Taliban rules. Quais' family is constantly trying to find safe places to live until they can return to what's left of their home. Going to school was often not an option but the family's love of books and learning never wavered. His descriptions of the words and actions of his mother, father and grandfather were often breathtakingly beautiful. His descriptions of the countryside were full of sensual details. The scenes where Quais is learning to knot a rug are simply gorgeous. There is humor interspersed like his escapade with the dog and the pomegranates.This book is a special inside look at Afghanistan written by an Afghan who experienced more than most of us could ever imagine. It is not told with bitterness or even a speck of self- pity but rather with an underlying optimism that as a family they could survive whatever hardships came their way. They always remembered what was: \" In the time before the fighting, before the rockets, before the warlords and their false promises, before the sudden disappearance of so many people we knew to graves of foreign lands, before the Taliban and their madness, before the smell of death hung daily in the air and the ground was soaked in blood, we lived well.\"The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was that I thought there were a few parts that needed to be pared down. The narrative was occasionally bogged down by the details/tangents.So Quais Akbar Omar looks back on his childhood as he writes his family's story. At the end, he tells us: \"I have long carried this load of griefs in the cage of my heart. Now I have given them to you.

This novel is truly eye opening, life changing, and searing to the heart, but is told with no embellishment, no tools to create unnecessary drama, the stark and honest tone of Qais's story is rending to the heart and spirit. At many points, the reader has to wonder how Qais survived all he did, and how he came out of it with such a strong connection to his homeland, his family, and his own sense of right and wrong. This story is one that will show you a glimpse of life in a country, Afghanistan, that many have misconceptions about, and reminds us all that people are people no matter where they are born, what they believe, and underneath it all, most just want to be free to live a life of peace and freedom from violence and war. An exceptional story by an exceptional writer, who just happens to be an exceptional human being. **WARNING, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS**Qais Akbar Omar begins his true-life tale as a child in a very large and tight-knit family living in a large compound in the city of Kabul, Afghanistan at the time the Russian forces are finally leaving the country in 1989. Afghanistan, after years of Socialist influence, is in political turmoil, but Qais and his family are optimistic that the change will bring with it positive changes in his country. Qais lives in his Grandfather's home, a compound of rooms that house his large extended family, many uncles and their wives and children. He looks up to his father, a well respected former boxer and a physics teacher, who also sells and trades precious antique hand-knotted rugs. He is very close to his Grandfather, and looks up to him with great respect, as does the community he lives in. His Grandfather is well respected, and often advises people on business matters as well as works to ensure that the community provides support for members in need. It is clear that Qais has a good life, his family is well established and relatively wealthy, but they are richer for their close relationships between siblings and cousins. Their days consist of learning, sharing meals, flying kites, and enjoying the beautiful gardens of the city of Kabul.The first signs of change occur when the shouts of the Mujahedin, or Holy Warriors, can be heard in the streets in 1991. From this point on, nothing and no one is safe. Snipers hide in the nearby hills, rockets pound the beautiful city of Kabul and the city once known for it's gardens and tree lined streets becomes the center of civil war that rages for years to come. Qais Akbar Omar relates his tale of escaping the city and leaving behind his beloved home, while his entire family tries to find a way to safety. Food is scarce, danger is everywhere, and it seems that no matter how hard Qais's father tries to find a way out of the country, their attempts to flee are thwarted at every turn. With no money and no connections, the family moves from place to place with only the guidance of the BBC World News radio reports. Many times I felt dread as Qais tells his story, the violence he is exposed to is frightening, and one wonders how anyone survived the civil war that lasted so long between warring factions of the Mujahedin. Family losses are heavy, and weigh heavily on young Qais's developing sense of self.When the Mujehedin is ousted by the Taliban, things go from bad to worse. Now the dangers are not bombs and sniper bullets, but a twisted take on the Islamic religion that means no one is safe from judgement, and following ever tightening rules becomes almost an impossibility. This unique inside view of how the Taliban seemed to come out of no-where and gain a strangle hold on the entire country is frightening. Qais describes something that only an insider, a survivor, could share. The wild swings of fortune, and more often, misfortune are visceral and pulsating with dread. If you have ever wondered what it was like to live under Taliban rule, you must read this book. If you have ever wondered what living in a war-zone, where infighting between different factions of a Holy War literally decimate a population and a country, you must read this book. If you have wondered about the people of Afghanistan, the people just trying to live day to day, then this book will give you a glimpse that is fascinating. Most of all, this book is an amazing personal memoir of survival, and a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the connections of family and culture.Bottom Line: I highly recommend A Fort of Nine Towers by Qais Akbar Omar, it is so many wonderful things all in one gripping and riveting novel. It will change your view of a people, a country, and the amazing strength of one boy growing up in the most unsettled of times for this one country, Afghanistan, in all of it's history.

What makes this story different is that it is true. Qais Akbar Omar describes his life in Afghanistan from age 10 through age 19. It is an amazing story told beautifully through the eyes of a child and emerging young adult. Beginning with his life in Kabul before the political unrest, we see a loving, prosperous, joyous family. Then he describes the night when everything he has known changes. His family flees their home for survival. Qais lives through some horrific events - imprisonment, torture, bombings, attempted rape, sniper attacks, the death of people he loves - yet, he maintains a beautiful spirit of human kindness and decency. And, when we see his world as he did at 12 years old, it fills you with empathy and a better understanding of what this nation has endured for decades. What I loved about this book - the pacing and the descriptions of the interactions between Qais and the people he loves and the people he befriended. Qais has a very special relationship with his Grandfather. For anyone who has loved and been loved by an older relative this will certainly resonate with them. His Grandfather tells stories and gives him advice throughout the book. I loved his story about the 3 stages of marriage. \"The first stage is that you talk, and your wife listens. The second stage is, she talks and you listen. And the third stage is, both of you talk, and your neighbors listen,\" he said with a grin growing wide at the corners of his mouth until it became a big and loud laugh. \"The first stage is the best,\" he said.Qais makes friends during his family's nomadic journey from Kabul. He befriends a shepherd, Omar Khan, who turns out to be a distant cousin. The letter Omar subsequently writes to Qais gave me a knot in my throat. He also makes friends with neighbors in another village and learns to weave carpets from a beautiful young woman who cannot hear or speak. He visits a monk while they live in a cave behind a carved Buddha one winter. And, he talks to a prostitute to learn the reason for her lifestyle - such a touching moment when she asks him why he would want to learn her history. \"No, I don't know you, but I'm a human like you, and we should share the sorrows and the joys together.\" I loved that at the end of the book, Qais lets the reader know if he has encountered any of these significant people in his life again. There is a joyful moment when he finds someone who once saved his life. There was one part of Qais' life story that I was so horrified and heartbroken reading that I had to put the book down for a while. I have never read about such unimaginable cruelty. In that respect, it was very much like \"The Kiterunner.\" That Qais survives and continues to care about others and do the right things in life is a story I find inspirational. 5* and highly recommend."}, {"userName": "PDXReader", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2140505-pdxreader", "userReview": "A Fort of Nine Towers is the first-person account of Omar's childhood and teen years in war-torn Afghanistan. He grew up during an especially turbulent time in the country's history, witnessing the departure of the occupying Russian troops, the ensuing civil war that inflicted incredible hardship on the population as the mujahedeen sought to fill the vacuum, the subsequent takeover by the Taliban, and finally their ouster by the foreign coalition formed after 9/11. This is not the best written book I've ever read, but I found that it hardly mattered. The author relays both the good and the bad things he experienced with such clarity and depth that both his joy and his pain are palpable. I was particularly impressed with the love he and his family bore for each other throughout all their trials, never letting each other down. I found it a very moving story. It's also an open-ended one. As each occupying force left Afghanistan Omar began to hope that things would improve. And it sounds like things have gotten better since the Taliban left, but that there's still a long way to go, and one can sense Omar's disappointment that the coalition has not done a better job helping the country get back on its feet. His honesty was refreshing.At times Omar describes his life in idyllic terms, particularly his early childhood and throughout the middle section of the book where he and his family live a nomadic lifestyle. However, there are large chunks of his account that are almost unbelievably horrific. If you're the sensitive type, you should probably give this one a miss; it'll give you nightmares.I really felt I learned something from the author's account, and I think anyone with an interest in what's been going on in Afghanistan over the past 30 years would do well to pick up a copy."}, {"userName": "DubaiReader", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2368681-dubaireader", "userReview": "A powerful read.This book certainly packed a punch!An autobiographical story of a young boy's life in Afghanistan, from the final days of Communism, through civil war and the Mujahideen war lords, to the rise of the Taliban. His is a wealthy, well educated family, who must leave behind their home and wealth to escape the rocket attacks between neighbouring factions of the Mujahideen.They pile sixteen family members into the car and drive the five miles to a friend's house, known as the Fort of Nine Towers. This becomes their new home and the starting point for the many adventures they experience in their ultimate quest to escape from Afghanistan into a new life.This is a very close knit family and the love really shines through, in spite of the extreme situations they find themselves in. They are surrounded by a lot of cruelty and sadistic behaviour from the ruling powers, which at times can be harrowing to read about, let alone imagine living through.The Taliban the author describes are illiterate, unwashed and violent.Although I have read several books about Afghanistan at this time, most concentrate on the restrictions placed on women, so this was particularly interesting, coming from a male author and covering the problems from a male perspective.We discussed Fort of Nine Towers at our multicultural book group and it was an excellent discussion. One point that was raised however, that did make me think, was the question as to whether all this really happened to one man or if he may have included a few experiences from other friends or relatives. I'm on the fence with this question, but I can see why one might wonder....In spite of this, a truly powerful read, absolutely fascinating, this gripped me right to the end.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6037805-jan", "userReview": "A Fort Of Nine Towers is the memoir of Qais Akbar Omar's life between the ages of eleven and adulthood, a period in Afghan history of great turmoil. This book is actually two separate stories: the first a warm and often poetic tale of Qais' life within his large extended family and the second a brutal narration of the savage and senseless happenings when he falls into the power of first, the Mujahedin and their civil wars, and then the Taliban. The entwining of these two threads is what I feel makes this book so extraordinary. Beauty is integral to this book; the poetry of the language, the reverence for the country's history, the words of Islam, the gentleness of the people... I could go on forever. Some of the people that populate this book are unforgettable- I was especially taken with his mute teacher and his wise grandfather. His family's travels to escape the violence are riveting- imagine living in the eye of the giant Bamyan Buddah! The section where he and his family are rescued and stay in the garden in Tashkurghan and later his travels with his nomadic Kuchi relatives were cathartic- in the midst of much danger there is such kindness.

It excels on different levels. Qais' memoir is, first and foremost, a memoir of a man living though one of the biggest, hardest to comprehend conflicts of our age. He gives the reader a poignant and personal view of events that pulls away the clouded view all the political posturing of reporting that modern reporting gives to readers in the Western world. This book gives us that, but in addition, if gives us the story of a family and city as utterly perplexed as Western readers about that conflict. In that sense this book is also a memoir of a people. For the writer to capture that during a memoir is not easy, usually they get lost in one level or the other. Qais does this with a masterful touch. Then, even more beautifully, he also gives us a memoir of a developing psyche. The hardest of all things to capture/portray is the ephemeral nature of the inner world, let alone the development of it. This is the true jewel of the book. His use of conversations with his grandfather and cousin, along with other members of the family, is his primary tool to do this. As a writer, Qais doesn't chase his goal with relentlessness that gets tiresome to read, but rather with a gentle coaxing that allows him convey so much more.
