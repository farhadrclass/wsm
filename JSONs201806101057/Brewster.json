Men aren\u2019t supposed to read novels, but it\u2019s been documented that doing so won\u2019t actually kill us. So sensitive souls take note, this review contains some violence and adult language.First a question: did you ever read Catcher in the Rye? If so, did you wish you could seriously bust up Holden Caulfield with a baseball bat? What a dumb-assed prick! Recommendation: Brewster is the antidote to that other book. This too is a coming of age story, but minus the character that just pisses you off. This is the one your English teacher should\u2019ve assigned, if it had been written then. Most of us had some issues coming up in high school. It\u2019s a tough time of life and easy to identify with. Brewster has characters you can connect with, ones you care about and want good things to happen to. This story has an edge too and you know early on that things probably aren\u2019t going to end well. This is not a fairy tale. It has the feel of reality.Slouka\u2019s writing will make you work a little bit. He likes a turn of phrase so his prose will make you think and consider, but it won\u2019t get in the way of the story. Reading this book is more like running some light hills than shuffling around the corner to buy beer. When you run you sweat and it feels good. So guys, this is a book you can safely read with the cover showing on your morning commute. Maybe some other guy will see it and you can proudly tell him what you\u2019re reading. If you\u2019re not a guy, but you know one and wish he\u2019d read more than just the sports pages this is an easy call. If he reads Junger and Krakauer this is a really easy call. Just don\u2019t expect him to run off and join a book group.

The narrator is Jon Mosher, the son of Jewish survivors of a Nazi concentration camp. After a tragic death of his older brother when he was 4, his parents simply shut down\u2026never recovered. He mostly drifts through school until eventually forming an intense bond with Ray Cappicciano, a student on the fringes of high school with a bad boy persona. Ray\u2019s personal life is a gut-wrenching tale with a ruthless, alcoholic ex-cop for a dad. His reputation as a brawler conceals injuries that he receives from this venomous and brutal father.The two main characters in this story broke my heart. I felt like I was holding my breath at times - my escalating sense of foreboding was so powerful. The writing is remarkable - cryptic at times and beautiful in its austerity. Slouka created an intoxicating sense of place. The setting is the late 60\u2019s, a time period that I remember well. All the references to Vietnam, the music (Woodstock) and the current events brought back memories of those turbulent (but often exciting) years for me.This is one of my favorite novels for 2014. I haven\u2019t read anything by Mark Slouka but I surely will check out his other books.

There were sentences that went something like: Parents don\u2019t always love their kids\u2014there are no guarantees. That's heartbreak waiting to happen, particularly if those children are despised. This is a boys on the cusp of adulthood story. No cheap shots or extra drama here, excellent writing, 60s-70s nostalgia, and families that define tragic, dysfunctional childhoods with the consequences. It read like a memoir, so well done, and yet I began to grow restless about two thirds of the way in. I don\u2019t believe the author\u2019s talent is lacking, more that I am losing interest in this type of story at this point in my reading life, or at least one that is so gritty and true to life. I feel the need to offer a warning for those that share some of the lines I don\u2019t like to cross. While not gratuitous, there is child and animal abuse. While they are unavoidable facts of life on this planet I prefer to avoid them in my reading material. There is also love woven throughout. An unflinching look into what can shape a life and the relationships that can help sustain it until it can stand or fall on its own terms."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "If this novel does not win at least one major literary award, then the entire notion of writing prizes is meaningless."}, {"userName": "Snotchocheez", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez", "userReview": "4.5 starsBrewster, New York, circa 1970: a dead-end town a mere reefer-whiff away from Woodstock and the \"Summer of Love\" (yet worlds apart from the goings-on there) provides the backdrop for this rather stunning not-quite-YA-coming-of-age novel Brewster by Mark Slouka. It focuses on the unlikely friendship between Jon Mosher, a rather bright, earnest kid living with a family long trapped in stasis mode (thanks to the tragic death of his older brother) who resorts to running with the high school track team to escape the demons in his mind; and Ray Cappicciano, a kid from the \"wrong side of the tracks\", who is always getting into fights and straddling the line between Brewster High School and Juvie. This sounds on the surface like Mr. Slouka's travelling down a well-beaten \"self-discovery\" path, but his electric prose elevates this into something incredible, and haunting, and (perversely) beautiful. From the pitch-perfect dialog to the angst of adolescence during the Vietnam War years, Slouka captures the essence of life in Brewster with woozy precision and resonance.

Perhaps you remember what it was like to be a child without adults hovering above you, waving a complex daily agenda of sports and extracurricular activities that included themselves. In your youth, back in those days, maybe you were relatively free, because your parents were living their own tragic lives and you felt like an outsider. It's a little weird to remember how much we did on our own - riding our bikes everywhere, building forts, making friends and enemies, fighting our own fights, playing with literal fire, navigating the world without thinking there were adults who could help us. It was a simpler time, the 1960s and 70s, but I sometimes forget the cruelty of it, the nasty edge where an adolescent was expected to act like an adult but had no actual power to wield when things went wrong.Like when your father beats the shit out of you and the police laugh it off.Like when your mother despises you because you're alive and your brother, her favorite, is dead.Like when the school you attend does nothing in the face of the bruises and cuts that grace your body.This is the world of Brewster, New York, in 1968. Slouka's protagonist, Jon Mosher, narrates the story of his childhood and his friendship with Ray Cappiciano, a young man who lives under the thumb of one of those hideous fathers who seem only the creation of fiction, but who, unfortunately, are all too real. It's the story of what happens to both boys.Mark Slouka's writing has moments of grand beauty. The prose, for the most part, is graceful and straightforward. Occasionally, I got tired of the melodramatic, atmospheric tone of the narrative, but it never got so bad that I didn't want to finish. Every so often there was a line so good that I pencilled it. One example is a description of Jon Mosher's running coach: \"Etienne (Ed) Falvo was not a simple guy. First generation out of the Bronx, second out of Aosta, Italy, he was badgering, impatient, generous--hard to resist and hard to take. Everything about him seemed too much--too much curiosity, too much enthusiasm, too much energy--until you realized that you were looking at something like a happy man, a man condemned to love this world the way a father might love his convict son. Helplessly. Knowing better.\" Now that's a good description!Despite the unevenness of the story, I liked it better than a 3. Maybe a 4 with a little bit of a minus for the draggy bits."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Late 60's, in a small town called Brewster in New York, three boys and a young girl come of age. Charles Manson was in the news, being drafted for the Vietnam War was a real threat and Woodstock was happening a short distance away, these were circumstances happening outside their homes, but the real threat and the hurt would come from the place they should have been the safest, their own homes.I was very young during this time period but I remember my best friend's brother being drafted, seeing him in his uniform, leaving for boot camp, wondering if he would have any life left when he returned.. Jon and Ray are such wonderful characters, dealing with the hurts in their families in the only way they knew how. Good boys, troubled boys, boys the reader becomes emotionally involved with, want to save. Heartbreaking and powerful, such a wonderful and poignant book, nostalgic, the tone of the time, perfect. Jon, runs track and that becomes his outlet. Ray, and his family secrets, things he must not tell and a little brother that he loves and to whom he feels responsible. First love and friendship in all its glory and hardship. All seniors wondering how their lives will play out, how the world would change, where they would find themselves in the future. As they enter the seventies, things will change, the pace of the books speeds up and a horrifying and heartbreaking incident will leave them all reeling, and all their lives will never be the same. As Jon track coach tells him, \"You'll be okay, \"You can't see it now, but life goes on.\" That's the thing - it goes on with or without you.\"Maybe it's the weather, or that it is getting dark so early and is a bit depressing, but I think this is only the second book that I finished with a lump in my throat and a tissue in my hand., Friendship, pain and memories, the resilience of the human experience."}, {"userName": "switterbug (Betsey)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey", "userReview": "BREWSTER reads like a melancholy ballad sung by Leonard Cohen, Dylan, or Bruce Springsteen. It's like driving down a remote, one-lane dark road surrounding a black reservoir, the starless sky doomy and vast. You are headed toward a forgotten city. Now and then a beacon in the distance blinks like a metronomic eye. Brewster is a static town in upstate New York, where it always feels like winter, \"weeks-old crusts of ice covering the sidewalks and the yards, a gray, windy sky, smoke torn sideways from the brick chimneys.\"It was the end of the sixties, and studious, unpopular Jon Mosher, the narrator, connects with rogue, slanty, Ray Cappicciano, and Frank \"Jesus\" Krapinski. They were 16 and wanted to get out of Brewster, dreamed of a better life. Jon, whose Jewish parents fled Germany to America, and opened a shoe store in Brewster, survived in a gloomy atmosphere, because his parents never recovered from Jon's brother's premature and tragic death years ago, for which Jon feels responsible.Ray's father is a racist, truculent ex-cop who drinks all day. Ray was the more mysterious, taciturn, and enigmatic of the three friends. His mother left before he could remember her, and his stepmother left when his baby brother, Gene (barely a toddler now) was born. Ray is devoted to Gene. Frank teaches Sunday school and believes in Jesus as the savior. All carried their parents' burdens, and all vowed to leave Brewster for greener pastures after graduation.Jon finds a sense of purpose on the track team, and Frank begins to question his faith when his family demonstrates hypocrisy, shunning his sister when she becomes pregnant. Ray hooks up with smart, beautiful Karen Dorsey, and they become a fearsome foursome. Oftentimes, Ray would disappear for days and come back banged up and bruised, from fights he said he competed in in Danbury. As more disappearances occurred, the tale hints at more ominous consequences.This is a coming of age story, sans sentimentality. It is a tale of loss and the long shadows cast from tragedy and adversity. The tone of the novel is both reflective and melancholy, and the sense of suffocation and imprisonment, and thwarted hopes, swirls like the icy wind of Brewster's winters. There's a feeling of paralysis, and yet, woven within Jon's voice is the promise of a thaw, of a hibernating redemption within an unquiet stillness. This hope buoys the narrative from a relentless pessimism, and also mitigates the pressure cooker of looming menace. I couldn't be sure how it would evolve, the youthful dreams suspended and the freighted sorrow of their lives more dire as the novel progresses.\"There was no going back, though thinking about it, I'm not sure there was much to go back to anyway. Truth is, there's nothing more stupid than fighting something there isn't--a lack of love, a lack of respect. It's like fighting an empty room...You punch the air, you yell, you weep, but there's nobody there--just this feeling that there's something holding you back, that there's a place outside that room that could answer everything, that could tell you, finally, who you are. And you're not allowed to go there.\"Slouka's prose is assured, meditative, and beautiful. I was a fan after I read THE VISIBLE WORLD, which shared some themes of displacement, the legacy of war, and urgent love. This novel is a sterling tour de force, which left me both shattered and hopeful. If you like literature with depth, emotion, atmosphere, and authenticity, you will be touched by the pathos and humanity of BREWSTER."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie", "userReview": "This fictional alternately beautiful and brutal coming of age tale narrated by Jon Mosher looking back on his high school days (1968) in Brewster , New York, contains its own soundtrack.

As a coming-of-age story, it falls into that time-honored genre that includes books such as This Boy\u2019s Life by Tobias Wolff, Indian Horse by Richard Wagamese, Stand by Me by Stephen King\u2026and you can almost hear Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Born To Run playing in the background.It\u2019s hard to bring something new to the time-honored coming-of-age story, particularly one that\u2019s set in the late 1960s, where everything has become almost a tired plot clich\u00e9: Vietnam, the assassinations, Woodstock, Boomer nostalgia. But Mark Slouka has done it here. This book broke me and put me together again, touched my heart and made me ache for the characters and for humanity. That\u2019s a tall order for a book.What\u2019s it about? It takes place in Brewster \u2013 a real blue-collar city that\u2019s about an hour away from the glamour and glitz of New York City. Jon Mosher, our narrator, is shunned by his devastated mother after his older brother falls victim to a hapless accident in childhood (shades of Ordinary People.) His best friend, Ray, is a good-hearted bad boy who is raised single-handedly by a violently abusive and alcoholic ex-cop father. Both boys see a gleam of light at the end of the tunnel: Jon, through his talent as a track star and Ray through the transcendent love of a classmate, Karen.This is a book about outsiders, and Jon quotes Gandhi: \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.\u201d Or are the odds so stacked against you that you can\u2019t win, no matter what? Where do you go when you\u2019re seventeen, when there\u2019s nowhere to go, and when you\u2019re running the only race you\u2019re meant to run\u2026with a goal so elusive it\u2019s hard to ever imagine getting there? The eventual answer has a lot to do with loyalty and finding of self, and when it comes, it packs a wallop that will take the breath out of you. It\u2019s filled with psychological acuity and gritty realism that makes the characters leap off the page.And it\u2019s beautifully written. AN example: \u201cIt was a beautiful September, stunned and perfect, lie the world had been hit on the head: chill mornings, a warm mist over the cold grass, now and then a leaf dropping down like it was being lowered on a string, sparkling in the sun, then going out.\u201d Brewster\u2014a book that\u2019s not afraid to tackle broken lives and broken dreams and the overwhelming urge to survive when life won\u2019t let you \u2013 is, as the book jacket suggests, an \u201cunforgettable coming-of-age story.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/639730-dan", "userReview": "[Reminded me of Where All Light Tends to Go, especially at the end.

In the case of Mark Slouka's wonderful new novel, Brewster, you may have seen similar stories, but even though you may know where the plot will go or how the characters develop, you'll still find yourself completely invested, which is a testament to the power of Slouka's writing.It's 1968, and the world is on the verge of major change. In the small dead-end town of Brewster, New York, high school student Jon Mosher is ready for the change to come. Raised by parents distant since the death of his older brother when Jon was four years old, he's biding his time until he can leave all of this behind. And when he is convinced by one of his teachers to start running track, he is finally fueled by a motivation other than the urge to flee.When Jon meets Ray Cappicciano, a rebellious student who also seems as if he is on the outside looking in, the two form a close-knit bond, a brotherhood. Ray, the son of an alcoholic ex-cop father with a violent streak, is a fighter, but he is also surprisingly sensitive, taking care of his young half-brother, Gene, and keeping him out of their father's line of fire. Jon and Ray dream of leaving Brewster, and when Jon, and then Ray, fall for beautiful, intelligent Karen, the trio, along with their friend, Frank, start planning their escape.\"We were like that CSNY song, which didn't make sense but kind of did: '...one person...two alone...three together...four...'\u2014and for a while we were\u2014'each other.' If confusion had its cost\u2014if it was confusion\u2014we didn't know that then.\"Obstacles start to stand in the way of their leaving, however. Jon's track career becomes more and more successful, and he pushes himself as hard as he can to help his team win. But he continues to struggle with his relationship with his mother, whom he believes blames him for his brother's death, and for surviving. And Ray's father starts to veer more off course with every day, threatening their plans\u2014and their safety.Brewster is a book about the loyalty and unshakable bonds of friendship and love, about how sometimes simply having someone believe in you is all you need. It's also a book about how our friends can become our family, and fill the gaps we have in our relationships with those to whom we're related by virtue of blood. As I mentioned at the start of the review, there's not much in this story you haven't seen before, but the sense of nostalgia, of the memories provoked by friendships that develop in high school and childhood, works to the book's definite advantage.Mark Slouka is a fantastic storyteller. He pulls you into the plot, into the characters' lives and what transpires with them, quickly yet without a modicum of flash, and before you know it you're hooked. Between this and Ron Carlson's Return to Oakpine, which I read prior to this book, I've had the chance to read two terrific books about the strength and the pull of friendship, no matter how far you are from each other, or how many years pass."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188447-jessica", "userReview": "It\u2019s really hard, I think, to write a book where it feels like almost nothing significant is happening and yet the reader does not want to stop turning to pages. Mark Slouka\u2019s pulled that off with Brewster, a slow burning book about sixteen-year-old Jon Mosher growing up in late 60s upstate New York. Jon\u2019s parents never got over the death of his brother twelve years earlier, which leaves him feeling very isolated and disconnected. He is recruited for the track team and becomes determined to prove himself. He is also befriended by Ray, whose main motivation in life is to get out of Brewster and away from his violent, alcoholic father.This book is about a lot of ideas: loyalty, the bonds of friendship, the turbulence of the late 60s, feeling trapped in a place that doesn\u2019t want you. On the surface, Jon and Ray don\u2019t seem like natural friends but they forge a connection because each is burdened with difficult family lives \u2013 Jon reflects that he can\u2019t remember a time when his mother loved him because she\u2019s too busy grieving for her first son; Ray gets into street fights to account for the bruises his father leaves behind. As Jon becomes a stronger piece of his track team, he and Ray share the dream of running away from Brewster with their third friend Frank and Ray\u2019s girlfriend Karen.This book devastated me, and that\u2019s mostly due to the fact that I just wasn\u2019t expecting it to be as powerful as it was. There are times when his narration is full of dread, a foreboding use of foreshadowing and I found myself worried that it might be too heavy-handed, especially because a lot of what was happening on the page itself seemed to be almost mundane. It\u2019s just two teenagers trying to get by as they\u2019re counting down the days. But don\u2019t let Slouka fool you \u2013 he\u2019s gradually driving you into some very powerful territory. This book didn\u2019t just make me cry the way that a love story with an unhappy ending makes me cry. This book left me emotionally raw, wishing that it wasn\u2019t inappropriate to call up my therapist at 11 at night to discuss the feelings that a book had stirred up inside of me. This is a book that sneaks up on you, then grabs you by the ribs and refuses to let go. I haven\u2019t even figured out how to write about it without sounding like a blubbering idiot, so it\u2019s entirely possible that I\u2019ll scrap this and write a new review in a few days once I can wrap my brain around things again."}, {"userName": "Andy Miller", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2448436-andy-miller", "userReview": "I'm in a minority, most reviews from the New York Times to the vast majority of Goodreads reviewers loved this coming of age novel set in 1968 upstate New York. I found that his writing style of choppy paragraphs, short chapters and cliche flashbacks to the sixties resulted in an unrealistic and not very compelling plot about superficial charactersThe novel is narrated by Jon, a high school student who lives with his two parents who escaped from the Holocaust and lost their other son to a freakish childhood accident causing Jon to grow up in an emotionally empty home. Jon's narrative focuses on 3 friends, Ray, a stereotypical high school \"outlaw\" who comes from an abusive home(this could be considered a spoiler alert as the physical abuse is not confirmed until late in the novel as part of the climax but the earlier descriptions of injuries were so obvious, and so unrealistic, that I found no literary tension at all. There were two other friends, Frank a track athlete who comes from a fundamentalist family and Karen, who Jon loves but becomes Ray's girlfriend in a Beauty and Beast relationshipThere is a subplot, Jon is convinced by a teacher to try out for track and Jon becomes a track star and inspired by his studies enough to eventually get admitted into Columbia. But this believable and attractive storyline culminating with a relay race for the state championship is too much of an afterthought for the novel which spends more time focusing on stereotypical events, blacks are bussed into high school, the daughter of the fundamentalist family gets pregnant and the catholic church tells the family to abandon her, a neighbor girl argues with her dad about Martin Luther King and decides to quit college and go to a commune, after she seduces Jon at a neighboring \"hippie\" cottage.Again, my view is a decided minority, but I was disappointed and would not recommend it"}, {"userName": "Rene Kirkpatrick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2230979-rene-kirkpatrick", "userReview": "Oh, my god. Okay, this was absolutely brilliant but a book you should read in the daylight. And in the summer. Reading Brewster in January, in the cold, dark days of winter really put me in Brewster, walking and running (and fighting) right along with Jon, Ray, and Karen. Every cut on my body stung with cold, every deep breath in made me wheeze. Huh. Good writer.Brewster is the story of 4 friends told by Jon, a boy who's been living with his dead brother hung around his neck for the last 15 years. He's smart, likes poetry, and loves his friends. Ray is his best friend, a boy who is always in a fight, constantly bruised and broken, an outsider outside of this little group of friends. The book is Jon's answer to the question of Why couldn't he see what he could have done? Was there ever anything he could have done?Kids never appear to see what's below the skin of relationships; it's hard to push for different answers when someone won't tell. What do you do? You love them, let them keep their secrets, let them stay with you when they have to, fight for the things you know you can win or help with. kids, young adults, teens, they don't have any power, the adults can't do anything \"to help\" without making huge problems for everyone. So what do you do? Wait until something breaks that can never be replaced and be there to paste together what you can.Ah, I know I'm going to be living with this book for a while. Beautifully written, amazing dialogue, no smooth edges, hard to read (I almost had to read the ending to see if I could handle it), too realistic at times- anyone who's ever worked in schools or with kids knows what can happen.It was good.

The narrator\u2019s voice created true intimacy with the reader, drawing me into the circle of these young friends so that I could touch their pain, hope, grief, confusion, love. Never did this author need to tell the reader what to think or feel, rather he allowed us to accompany the characters and trusted the story to the reader. This is a coming of age story set in a working class town in the late 1960s, when private pain was hidden, domestic tragedies went unacknowledged and youth were expected to fight adult battles for them. I am so glad to have discovered this gifted writer."}, {"userName": "Sonia Reppe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/455200-sonia-reppe", "userReview": "The scenes are short and the 1st-person voice is kind-of streamy and hard to understand sometimes.  He was right, life wasn't simple. Parts of it were--a frog scratching its head like a dog, the clean, heavy weight of a bolt in your hand, certain songs--and you'd try to hold on to these but you couldn't hold on for long. Things would get complicated, and the more you thought about them, the more complicated they got.It's hard to explain about her. It's like trying to describe the smell of fresh-cut grass on those evenings in June when everything stands out from everything else, when the shadows moving up the trees are as sharp as the leaves that made them. You can compare it to something else, you can break it down into parts and hope they add up, but really it's about how it makes you feel.Some of the descriptions were good, but mostly the scenes were flimsy and the pace drove me crazy. The issue of child abuse was depressing."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "This quote from \"Brewster\" is certainly apropos: \"Life isn't simple. Literature shouldn't be either.\" This novel has many layers, akin to that of an onion. Devouring this impacting book isn't advised as many deep-seeded elements and truths would be passed over, and the ultimate magnitude of this literary work would be greatly diminished. The very unfolding of this novel - jagged starts and stops, whirlwinds of action and moments of seemingly nothingness, no chapter numerations, pivoting time structure - mirrors the teenage years, appropriately. It is told primarily in respect, memories from the narrator's teenage years regarding his hodge-podge crew of friends and the chaotic unsettling troubled times of the late sixties. And fair warning, some of the language is rough and tumble. However, it didn't detract from the story, and it wasn't anything I couldn't easily bypass. Overall...excellent book, highly recommended for those who enjoy reading with depth."}, {"userName": "Washington Post", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22033614-washington-post", "userReview": "\"Brewster\" is a masterpiece of winter sorrow, a tale of loss delivered in the carefully restrained voice of a man beyond tears.

Although the brooding teenagers in these pages listen to Jefferson Airplane and grouse about the Vietnam War, \u201cBrewster\u201d is about as psychedelic as a bruise. Instead, this is a masterpiece of winter sorrow, a tale of loss delivered in the carefully restrained voice of a man beyond tears.Slouka, who lives in Brewster, N.Y., the town of the book\u2019s title, is a contributing editor to Harper\u2019s magazine, where he\u2019s published essays that remind us how vital and incisive that form can still be. Fans of his short fiction and his previous two novels will find here the same quiet wisdom and muted prose that practically mock the pyrotechnics of our hottest novelists.\u201cBrewster\u201d is a story about a friendship so potent that it\u2019s taken years for the narrator to understand what happened and what it meant. \u201cI can talk about it now,\u201d Jon Mosher says at the opening. He\u2019s looking back at high school in the blue-collar New York town, which made him feel \u201clike somebody twice as strong as you had their hand around your throat.\u201d During those angst-ridden years, Jon says, \u201cMy biggest fear was that I\u2019d . . . suffocate inside my own skin.\u201dThat sense of entrapment will resonate with anyone who\u2019s survived adolescence, but Jon\u2019s family has suffered a singular tragedy that casts a shadow on their home: When Jon was 4, his older brother electrocuted himself while playing with a lamp. His parents, who assumed they\u2019d left such horrors behind when they escaped the Nazis, never recovered. \u201cThey just broke,\u201d Jon says. \u201cPeople break, just like anything else. They\u2019d lost everything once, now they\u2019d lost it again.\u201d He grew up without much memory of his dead brother \u2014 no one ever speaks of him \u2014 but his mother still moves around in a catatonic state, shrieking into action only when Jon dares to disturb one of his brother\u2019s carefully preserved trinkets. Theirs is not so much a home as a kind of living crypt, which Jon can\u2019t wait to escape but is too dutiful to abandon. \u201cSometimes it felt like there\u2019d been some kind of mistake,\u201d he says, \u201clike I was the one who\u2019d died and nobody wanted to admit it. Mostly I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dSlouka portrays that fetid house in all its enervating effects, but he\u2019s just as powerful when framing the unlikely friendship that redefines Jon\u2019s life. Ray Cappicciano is the school\u2019s bad boy \u2014 tall, unwashed, often suspended. Some of the teachers hate him. Some fear him. He gets in fights, sometimes for money. \u201cWith his long coat and his dancing brawler\u2019s walk and his black hair which he was always raking back with his fingers, he drew people like something dangerous, unstable,\u201d Jon says. Behind that swagger, though, Slouka unveils the grubby truth of a poor teenager in a dead-end town: The son of an alcoholic ex-cop with a history of domestic abuse, Ray can barely stay in school while trying to defend himself and protect his baby brother.By his demeanor, his grades, his schedule, his family, Ray seems to have nothing in common with studious Jon, but this is one of those rare high school friendships that are felt with an intensity all out of proportion to the logic of circumstances. \u201cIn Brewster there was no other side of the tracks,\u201d Jon notes, but \u201cif there was, Ray would have lived there.\u201d And if, for a moment, we can put aside our reductionist insistence on sexualizing all relationships, this is a story of love. Snared in families damaged in very different ways, these two young men see something pure and admirable in each other: a determination to run a race neither of them can win.Slouka puts flesh on that metaphor through much of the novel by describing Jon\u2019s involvement with the track team. When the coach insists he join the team, Jon overcomes his nerdy reluctance and begins training with the other guys, even though the only thing more painful than the side stitches is the humiliation. Soon, he\u2019s improving, learning the rhythm of the road and breaking through limits he thought far beyond him. That sounds, I know, like the starting gun of a race toward a sentimental finish, but Slouka never jogs around that well-worn plot; these pages never shift into a scene of slow-motion victory with Mom and Dad \u2014 finally \u2014 cheering in the stands. Instead, Slouka concentrates on the way running allows Jon to focus his mind on the elemental properties of physical pain and measurable time; to rise above, for a while at least, the subterranean anguish that would swallow him at home.Slouka has developed an elliptical storytelling technique that might tempt you to imagine that, despite the elegance of these sentences, nothing much is happening in his novel \u2014 just sullen teens getting in scrapes and counting down the days. But that would be a misimpression that too many distracted parents and unsympathetic teachers make about such kids. Beneath the shrugs and oblique responses, their lives are riven by impossible choices, spiritual crises and \u2014 it eventually becomes clear \u2014 acts of unspeakable cruelty. Slouka\u2019s real triumph here is capturing the amber of grief, the way love and time have crystallized these memories into something just as gorgeous as it is devastating."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15367664-laura", "userReview": "Ok, I don't know who picks the Booker list but both Mark Slouka and Anthony Marra (A Constellation of Vital Phenomena) got robbed this year! Brewster is one of those books you finish reading and slump back dejectedly in your chair and let the air whoosh out in a big sad sigh because its so beautiful and its over and there's nothing left to read.This is the only book by Mark Slouka I've read so far, and for me, it was as if one crossed the darkside of Gillian Flynn with the poet prose of David Wroblewski, threw in a dollop of Cormac McCarthy's austerity and then added a one-two punch of Steinbeck and Shakespeare. I believe this story is destined to be a classic. Essentially its a story of a tight-knit group of friends as they wrap up their last months of being young adults, yet its not a coming of age story or a young adult piece of fiction. This is a story of how life happens and in an instant changes the trajectory you were on and affects the rest of your life in such a way you are no more able to part with it than you would an eye or a leg or a lung. Set in 1968 and fostered by all the life-changing events of the sixties, the story revolves around it's narrator, Jon Mosher who at sixteen is finding himself and trying to find a way out of a house ruled by tragedy - the death of his older brother when Jon was too young to even remember. A loner, Jon finds a rare and consuming friendship with the rebellious Ray Cappicciano, a lovable, troubled tough guy who has more than his own share of hardships living at home with a drunken father. Two other characters attach to this small nucleus, Karen and Frank, but the story really revolves around Jon and Ray and gradually lets the reader in on the power of their friendship. The writing is remarkable, gorgeous in its simplicity and page-turning in the author's ability to create tension in everyday life. This goes on the list of books I'll be buying for all my friends on birthdays or Christmas.

Set in the late 1960s in the USA, it\u2019s a story of growing up in a small town. It\u2019s about boys becoming men, it\u2019s about finding your identity and it\u2019s about the pain we live through. This is a hard review to write because this book is so good. It moved me. It kind of haunts me. It has a power all of its own.Jon is the protagonist and he tells the story. I guess he\u2019s looking back and recounting this time in his life. A time when his life felt anything but liberated. It\u2019s a story of a friendship between two boys both with family troubles. Ray sees a quality in Jon which he recognises and though they never talk about it, they become friends. They walk the streets in winter. They sit by the lake in summer. Jon is recruited to join the track team. He runs. It lets him conquer pain. It gives him a purpose. Ray sits in the bleachers and watches. But periodically Ray disappears for days at a time. He comes back bruised with stories of illicit boxing matches and girls he fought tough guys over. And Jon expects nothing less of Ray. He\u2019s the hard man. He\u2019s dangerous and everyone at school knows it.Jon tells the story retrospectively jumping around sometimes as he remembers different moments of those few years. I guess it doesn\u2019t sound like much happens here. But it does as much as it can in a small town and in a country which is at war with Vietnam and it the midst of the summer of love.I happen to read a review of Brewster in the Sunday Times Culture magazine and it stood out. I love coming-of-age stories and this one sounded right up me street. I wrote the name of the author and the title down. Then maybe two weeks later, I popped into the public library to collect something I\u2019d reserved and I spotted it on the way out. It seemed serendipitous. I must have been meant to read this book.It\u2019s the sort of book you could read more than once. I need to get my own copy now because I know I\u2019ll want to read it in years to come. It\u2019s brutally emotive. There\u2019s no doubt about it, this book will be a modern classic. Brewster is an outstanding piece of literature and above all, a moving story of the pain of growing up.
