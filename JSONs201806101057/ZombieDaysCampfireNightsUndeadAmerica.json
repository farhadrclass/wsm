Having to put her parents down is only the beginning to a very long list of difficult choices she must make. The CDC attempted and failed to keep the outbreak of the virus under control, and it quickly becomes a bloody, murderous plague that sweeps the country.After six months, the power comes back on in the middle of the night. Jenna and Michael turn on the television to find a sickly looking Chase Franklin claiming New Orleans is a safe zone. \"All roads lead to New Orleans.\" Whether they want to end up there or not.Zombie Days, Campfire Nights is narrated in the first person, with multiple narrators. The dialog is easy to follow, and the characters are truly endearing.The characters may be young adults, but the content of Zombie Days, Campfire Nights is definitely for a mature audience. Each character was unique, and frankly they were developed to perfection. It was easy to relate to nearly all the characters. Nearly...but not all. What stood out to me the most in Zombie Days, Campfire Nights wasn't the budding young love, or persevering survivors. It was the visceral hate I felt for the antagonists. Don't get me wrong, they too were well written and technically I can't complain about them. However, the author wrote some horrible people that brought a scowl to my face on multiple occasions.The amount of violence to the female characters at the hands of men was nearly too much to handle. Even worse was the love for these abusers that Lola felt, believing she deserved the abuse. As a woman, it raised bile in my throat to see a woman exhibiting this behavior.The zombies aren't mindless shamblers. They're fast and brutal. And judging by the fact they can find their way home and open their front doors, they're smart; which makes for a very dangerous situation. Zombie Days, Campfire Nights is full of action and builds a readers anticipation as it reaches the major climax. This is definitely a book I will add to my list of sequels to watch for. The ending is exciting and I can't wait to see what happens next."}, {"userName": "Gordon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744257-gordon", "userReview": "There\u2019s relentless action, with nary a dull moment from the first page. Of course, in a story like this, certain characters exist for your scorn: the literal low-hanging fruit for undead dining, and Rhyne provides plenty of such satisfying moments in a healthy balance with unpredictable fates. While the book is exciting throughout, it begins to distinguish itself about halfway through, when \u201call roads lead to New Orleans.\u201d Here, the narratives converge, revealing grander designs, more sinister motives, and some impressive world-building. It\u2019s very well-paced and -structured. In fairness, I\u2019m not a big zombie fan (or of much speculative fiction in general), so I\u2019m a tough sell. My main criticism\u2014though par for the genre\u2014the writing itself didn\u2019t do much for me: very straightforward without the nuance and subtext I prefer, and which I\u2019ve enjoyed in the author\u2019s short stories. Of course, there\u2019s not much time for reflection in Undead America, chased as you are from one camp to the next, but I wish the reader were made to participate more viscerally instead of the narrators simply explaining how they\u2019re feeling all the time. That will appeal to some, however, and it definitely makes for a smooth, fast read that's otherwise fairly polished. Its prose stylings and the characters\u2019 behavior I\u2019d say imbue it with a Young Adult aesthetic, but with adult language. And vomit. So much vomit. If you\u2019re into the genre, give it a shot. Or a swing."}, {"userName": "Emily (On Emily's Bookshelf)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12815429-emily-on-emily-s-bookshelf", "userReview": "Bear with me - this review is half just a lot of gushing about the author's blog. ;)Rating : 5/5 StarsSource : Meee. c:First sentence of synopsis : Millions died when the zombie plague swept the country. For the survivors, the journey has just begun.My review : A good year or two ago, while doing one of my 3AM insomnia google searches, I came across a blog(blog link is http://www.leahrhyne.com) , and I immediately fell in love with the blog authors writing, it quickly became my favorite blog EVER and I started stalking it(even though I never left a comment c:) - I remember reading the posts about when Leah Rhyne was writing Zombie Days, when she sold it, etc.So I went into this book really nervous - it was a book i've always held on a high pedestal, I had some of the highest expectations i've really EVER set for a book.And it lived up to my expectations!I loved Leah Rhyne's writing style, the characters and plot were amazing, and all in all this was an amazing book, I stayed up way later than I should have reading it because I couldn't stop turning pages, needing to know what happens next, and I can't wait for the sequel!I definitely recommend this, it was an amazing Zombie book, although it was so much more than that - it definitely deserved the spot it's surely getting on one of my top ten books of 2013."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9602883-andrea", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this first book and can't wait for the rest. The characters are realistic and deep, the story is fast-paced, and the fact that there are historical allusions makes it that much better! I'm a slow reader, and I couldn't put the book down. I've always loved zombie/monster movies and books that do a good job of focusing on the flaws of humanity, and I think Leah does a better job than some of the more well-known zombie stories in this book. Can't wait for the next book!"}, {"userName": "Melanie Page", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1519649-melanie-page", "userReview": "Review coming very shortly!"}, {"userName": "Charleston Library", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9195324-charleston-library", "userReview": "I loved this book!!!!!!!!!

It took a different spin on the zombie apocalypse than I\u2019ve seen, and one I actually could buy. I\u2019ve read some books that had me rolling my eyes on most of the pages, but I didn\u2019t feel that way this time. There were some parts that were a bit of a stretch\u2014but that happens in all zombie novels, and will probably be the same in mine. But it was enjoyable. It held my attention and had me wanting to read more. I do plan to read the follow up books and would recommend this one to anyone who enjoys zombies. I liked that it focused on survival and relationships, because that\u2019s what I enjoy reading and writing myself. Since the book switches perspectives between three different characters, I\u2019m going to split the rest of my review into three sections. Jenna:I believe this book is supposed to be New Adult, and overall it didn\u2019t feel YA to me. The language and situations were older, and there were some gross parts that had even me cringing. So, as a whole it didn\u2019t feel young. But I had an issue with Jenna\u2019s maturity. She\u2019s a teenager at the beginning of the book, so it\u2019s understandable for her to start off reading like a kid. But as the story progressed, I wanted to see more growth in Jenna, and I didn\u2019t really get it. Even after months of fighting and struggling to survive, she still felt very young to me. I thought her actions developed, but her character didn\u2019t. If that makes sense. I could never get past thinking of her as a child. In most books where a young person is thrown into a stressful or mature situation, you begin to forget how young they truly are. The characters voice just never matured enough for me to feel that with Jenna.She and her \u201cbest friend\u201d Michael escape the initial wave, and spend the next several months traveling together. Of course, their relationship quickly develops into something more than just friends. There was supposed to be a very strong emotional connection between them, but again, I didn\u2019t feel it. Their relationship felt like best friends to me. There was no desire, only necessity. I get that this is a story more about survival, but I wanted to be able to root for them more. I just couldn\u2019t.Sam:Michael\u2019s brother, who was away at college and presumed dead by Jenna and Michael, pops up now and then. I honestly don\u2019t know what to say about him. He went through some interesting things, but made what I consider to be weak and even stupid choices. I honestly felt during most of the book that he was there as a place holder. I believe he will play a big part in the story down the road, but as far as book one goes, he could have disappeared and it would have affect the story very little. On top of that, I found myself angry at him sometimes. I wanted to reach into the book and shake him. Tell him to grow a pair even. It was frustrating to read his story at times and I didn\u2019t get much of a feel for his personality at all.Lola:Lola\u2019s group was by far the most interesting to read about. Lola herself was a well-developed character. I love characters who are complicated and come with lots of baggage, and Lola\u2019s group had just that. Lola\u2019s brother BJ saves her before the zombies come, and he has big plans for how to profit from the destruction of the world. Their relationship is so codependent you can\u2019t help but be entertained and annoyed by it. Lola is probably one of the weakest characters I\u2019ve ever read, but she\u2019s written in a way that it doesn\u2019t matter. You still want to find out what happens to her. BJ is an abusive, power-hungry asshole who either loves or hates his sister. It\u2019s hard to really tell. Enter Chase. He\u2019s an alcoholic, womanizer, asshole who\u2019s just as power-hungry as BJ, and he takes advantage of Lola\u2019s stupidity. But he has some kind of weird attachment to BJ that I never could wrap my head around. I didn\u2019t get his thing with Jenna, though. That seemed far-fetched, but when I look at his obsession with BJ, maybe not so much. It\u2019s hard to say. This guy was an enigma, and I found myself wishing I could have had a little peak into his head so I could figure out what the hell he was actually thinking. One minute I was sure he was out to get BJ, the next I thought he might actually be in love with the guy. It was bizarre, but had me curious.The book, of course, ends with a cliffhanger. I\u2019m curious to find out what happens in the next book and hope to get a chance to sit down and read it in the next few weeks. Then I\u2019ll post a review for that. Overall, Leah Rhyne did a great job and I would highly recommend her books to others."}, {"userName": "Jeremy Dyson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11296958-jeremy-dyson", "userReview": "Zombie Days Campfire Nights is the entertaining opener for a series, built on strong characters and interesting plot twists. The story follows a group of friends that become separated during a zombie apocalypse. The chapters hop between several narrators, which the uses very well to capture different voices of the characters. While Jenna is the main protagonist of the story, each of the characters has their own struggles and needs that drive the plot forward.While Jenna is the main protagonist and the focal point of the story, I felt myself really drawn into Sam's Journey with the leathernecks. It is among the darkest elements of the book and really provides a contrast to the other chapters. This story seemed like it could have been a whole separate novel, and if it was I would have read it, too.The story builds to an exciting ending, resolving the major conflicts in the novel, but leaving some strings to be tied together in the rest of the series. I look forward to finding out what is next for Jenna and her zombie smashing baseball bat."}, {"userName": "Brian McMickle", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63927418-brian-mcmickle", "userReview": "Warning, reading this book while camping may increase paranoia. I stumbled across this book after finding Leah's name on a Charleston's best of author list and decided give the book a whirl. What I found was an intriguing cast of very realistic characters. I found myself getting mad at them from time to time if anyone did something stupid, which in a Zombie Apocalypse, there are bound to be plenty of stupid mistakes made. In any case, the story really pulled me in and the writer has a very enjoyable style all her own. This one is certainly worth picking up."}, {"userName": "Lisa Lunney", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4505590-lisa-lunney", "userReview": "http://littlemisstrainwreck.com/2013/...Great read.
