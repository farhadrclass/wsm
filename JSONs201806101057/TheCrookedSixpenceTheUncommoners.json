Having seen it as a Waterstones' children book of the month, I thought I would give it a try, but I never expected this!First of all, this is not a story of kids at school a la Harry Potter. Imagine instead something not unlike Diagon Alley and London Below, but incredibly bigger and with more depth. Then add every day items, such as combs, toilet brushes, bells, that have some very unusual properties and uses: a candle that makes you invisible; a suitcase that let's you travel great distances in a blink. Yes, exactly... :0). The whole concept of uncommon objects and uncommon people is absolutely brilliant. Jennifer Bell has created an incredibly fascinating and complex world deep underneath the capital, partly inspired by nursery rhymes and Cockney lore. The result is something that feels old, full of history, and yet new too.The story follows Ivy Sparrows, 11, and her elder brother Seb, who are staying with their beloved grandmother, who is rushed to hospital after a fall. Events soon spiral out of control, with kidnappings, death threats, creepy figures with rotted hands, monsters (grim-wolves to goulds) and a race against the clock to uncover an old mystery. The siblings have a typical love-hate relationships but ultimately will do anything to help each other. It is Ivy however who steals the show with her intelligence, courage and pragmatism. The rest of the cast is as good, with friends and enemies, which are not always clearly delineated. Scratch is one of the best, in my opinion, with his back to front speech - loved him.So, amazing world building, great characters, fast-paced action, thrilling adventure and very scary moments. What is there not to like? And this is a trilogy, which in this case is a good thing since I love Lundinor and badly want to go back there :0)"}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009204-cindy", "userReview": "Middle grade, or children's, fantasy is one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, it is a genre that runs hot and cold. There are really bad books out there that belittle readers, follow a format/template, or just are not that great. For every bad book out there, there is that one gem that is amazing. I read numerous children's fantasy books a year looking for that one gem. Sometimes I find them, sometimes I don't. This year, I found one early on \u2013 The Crooked Sixpence by Jennifer Bell. Jennifer Bell worked in a children's bookstore. She spent years listening to children (and adults) about what they liked and didn't like about books. After a while, she decided to write her own novel and thus The Crooked Sixpence was born. The Crooked Sixpence is a debut novel that doesn't feel like a writer's first novel at all. It is magical, has amazing world building, and characters that you just immediately want to follow through their adventures. Within the first few chapters, I had a very \"Harry Potter\" feeling about the book. No, it wasn't because it was a knockoff of Harry Potter, but I felt that magical feeling that I had (and still have) when reading Harry Potter. One of the things that Jennifer Bell has said she tried to do is take elements that were a favorite of readers and put them into her novel. She achieved that with The Crooked Sixpence. Readers will be able to notice the influence that other children's novels had on this book, but there is a certain unique feel to the book. For example, there is a very magical world that is hidden from non-magic people. The magical world relies upon objects that are typically thought of as normal, but some of them are special and have magical powers. A milk jug, for example, could be normal or if it is special in the magical world it is used as a lamp. Other examples include the magic folk have unique terms and sayings, the 'weird' clothing, and special shops and districts where the magic folk go to shop for their goods. Crooked Sixpence is filled with action and adventure, but it doesn't overshadow the world building or even the plot. There is a very real and dangerous threat that is present, but it isn't too scary or too dark for younger readers. Older readers will even find the threat dangerous to the magical world. I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. I expected to like it, I didn't know I would walk out with a book that I loved. It is one of those books I can certainly see myself reading over and over again with each reread I am sure I will grow to love it even more. Jennifer Bell certainly came onto the children's literature scene with a bang and I look forward to seeing what she brings in the future. It is still relatively early, but I can see this being one of the top books for 2017. If you liked Harry Potter and are looking for a new novel that has the magic and charm of Harry Potter, The Crooked Sixpence is the place to look. It properly captures the magic without making it feel like a failed knockoff. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Marie the Librarian", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23386706-marie-the-librarian", "userReview": "4,5 stars!

The cover blurb calls it \u201cpart Tim Burton, part J.K. Rowling,\u201d and I have to say, I agree 100% with that. From the first page, I was swept along with Ivy into Lundinor, a secret city. In Lundinor, Ivy encounters common objects, such as suitcases or belts, that have uncommon abilities. You travel to another place in a suitcase and belts carry you in the air. It\u2019s like magic to eleven year old Ivy, but she doesn\u2019t have long to wonder about everything. She has to rescue big brother Seb, who was arrested when they arrived in Lundinor. And that\u2019s just the beginning -- soon Ivy and Seb are in the thick of solving a decades old mystery in the uncommon city. I\u2019m explaining it badly, but I quite enjoyed the author\u2019s concept of common objects being uncommon and having special abilities. The explanation for uncommon objects caught me off guard, but as the book went on and I learned more about Lundinor and its citizens, it fit better. I liked the colorful cast of characters in THE CROOKED SIXPENCE. From Ivy to Granma Sylvie, Ethel, and Violet, everyone was quirky and interesting. I particularly liked that Ivy respected older characters. Granma Sylvie\u2019s amnesia and the Twelfth Night mystery in Lundinor went together very well, and I enjoyed the adventure of learning the truth right along with Ivy. I also have to say, I\u2019ve never read such creepy versions of selkies, and the villains in the book were quite villainous! Along with the descriptive writing, the illustrations really helped bring THE CROOKED SIXPENCE to life for me. Very rarely do I take much notice of illustrations, but here, I spent time looking at each one, enjoying the little details and the general style. For the first time ever, I want to look for more of an illustrator\u2019s work. I\u2019m looking forward to the next volume in The Uncommoners series, so that I can return to Lundinor with Ivy and Seb! ==Disclosure:Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher for review consideration; this did not influence my review in any way.See more of my reviews:"}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24192636-kara", "userReview": "Can we stop comparing every middle grade book to Harry Potter? Can we stop comparing every young adult book to Twilight or The Hunger Games? Cuz that would be great. The Goodreads book page for The Crooked Sixpence is littered with negative reviews and one star ratings comparing this book to Harry Potter. I suspect most of them are sock puppets, but even so, why do people do this? Because a book shares a few tropes, reviews accuse the author of plagiarism, when really, the book is nothing like Harry Potter. Reviewers that do this are dishonest to their readers, and frankly, they should be ashamed.But back to THIS book because it should be about that. The Crooked Sixpence is a wonderful tale with vivid characters and inventive world-building that I really enjoyed. Ivy and Seb discover a secret underground world that has been hidden from them for years since their grandmother got in a car accident and lost her memory.In the present, Granma Silvie has another accident, this one at home, and she is rushed to the hospital. She\u2019s okay, but her home is ransacked, and Ivy and Seb have to flee for their lives. They travel through a suitcase and arrive in this peculiar world. They find out that their parents have been kidnapped, and the only way to free them is to find this uncommon object (called The Great Uncommon Good) that the kidnappers are searching for.This wasn\u2019t a completely perfect book for me, because I wasn\u2019t as invested in it as I wanted to be, but it was still a fantastic story and an escape into a world that I wouldn\u2019t mind visiting myself someday. I think it was missing some emotion, but that\u2019s a hard thing to inject into a story as a first-time author, and it can come with more experience.The Crooked Sixpence doesn\u2019t bring anything new to middle grade, as it\u2019s about kids saving the world, but it\u2019s a unique adventure with some interesting mythology, and I can\u2019t wait to see what the author has in store for the next book."}, {"userName": "Alisha Marie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1585205-alisha-marie", "userReview": "I really wanted to like The Crooked Sixpence. I mean, it has a blurb from the author of The School for Good and Evil, which is a book I really enjoyed (despite not being a huge fan of middle grade novels) AND it's being compared to JK Rowling. I thought I would enjoy this one. Unfortunately for me, this didn't really happen.The Good: I thought Ivy was feisty and I really like that in a heroine. The world building in The Crooked Sixpence was extremely elaborate and very few aspects were brushed off. You really do get to know the world of Ludinor.The Not-so-good: The pacing in The Crooked Sixpence is all over the place. There are a few parts in this book that were engaging and off-putting (in a good way), but there were way more parts where the pacing lags. I spent most of this book wishing that the pace would pick back up so that I wouldn't be so bored. I never felt like that happened. I never really clicked with what was happening. Another thing that bothered me was Ivy. While I liked her feisty nature, she never really screamed 11 year old to me. She was written in a way where she seemed much older. Not in a precocious way, but rather in a way where you start to think \"This isn't just your smart/mature for her age 11 year old. This is someone who's not really 11.\"Overall, I wasn't a big fan of The Crooked Sixpence. I was bored throughout and thought that the book lagged quite a bit."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26486882-nicole", "userReview": "Very good, hit all the right spots & did fill the Hogwarts hole for a read. Ivy, 11 & her brother Seb, 14 are in hospital after their granma has a fall. The parents are on their way from jobs in London so the children go home... only to find the smell of wet dog in the house & 2 men arriving carrying what can only be described as toilet brushes?! Yes, of course I was hooked. I had no idea what was going to happen next everything was crazy and new. Travelling through bags Ivy & Seb find themselves thrown in with a petty thief called Valiant Kaye in an underground London type trading place of uncommon things. I would think it aimed at 9-12yrs as no rude words are in it, it's the Mum part of me thinking if my 8yr old is ready for it just yet, there is kidnapping and mild threat of violence if you count scratches on faces, the sonic punch drumsticks are cool, although the ghouls and other beings are mean the most horrid thing for me was a pulled off fingernail - yuck! I think this is something special for readers. I will be looking out for book 2 for surely they need to return, the uncommon adventure has just begun!

That cover is stunning, and the book was amazing inside too. I didn't fully love it, so I'm giving it three stars, but there were parts that I loved a lot. I found the story to be so good and interesting and I wanted to know more so badly. I will be reading the next books in this series for sure. So excited.I found the writing in this to be great. I enjoyed it at all times. And the characters were awesome. I liked Ivy and her brother Seb a whole bunch. There were things I didn't like about how some of the characters were written, felt a bit silly at times, but mostly I liked them all, and enjoyed getting to know them. So interesting.This book tells the story of eleven year old Ivy. And her fourteen year old brother Seb. And eee, I liked both characters so much. Ivy was adorable. And I loved that this book was from her point of view. I loved that she's smart and kind and just awesome. But I didn't like how she treated one character. Hmph. But besides that, she was awesome. And Seb was a pretty good character too. I'm curious about him. I adored their relationship with each other. Such awesome siblings. They are staying with their grandmother, who just had an accident, and is now going to the hospital. Which starts the whole story. There is so much happening, and bad people are coming after Ivy and Seb, and it's so exciting too. I enjoyed figuring out what all the bad people wanted.Not going to say too much about the plot, but it's so interesting. Ivy is trying to figure out what happened around forty years ago, when her grandma had a bad accident and lost all her memory of her life before. Because Ivy have just learned what her life was like before the accident, but not why she got hurt. And it was so interesting to try to figure it all out. So much happens in this book. For the most part I loved all of it. There were a lot of exciting moments. And the ending was pretty good too. I liked the mystery of it all.The plot in this book is set under London, sort of. There is a whole different world under there. Not magic. But like it, even so. There are uncommon objects, which can do amazing things. Not going to describe it, but it was awesome to read about. I liked learning what each item could do. It was exciting. And I really enjoyed the talking bells. They were adorable. Especially Scratch. Liked that tiny bell a bunch. There are also ghosts. Which was interesting. And some other creatures as well. I liked reading about all of them.The reason for why I'm giving this book three stars is because I had a few issues with some things. I felt like the book was a bit too much like Harry Potter at times, though I did enjoy that, it as just a little bit too much, with the villains and such. But still good. I had some issues with the new boy they meet, Valian. I liked him right away. And wanted to know more of him. But they treat him pretty badly, and I felt like his character could have been done better. Hope that is fixed in book two. I need more of this curious boy.I just adored some of the characters in this book. Ivy was so sweet. And I liked Seb too. And Valian was my favorite. I just wish I knew more about him; that he had been written a little bit better. But still. I can't help it. I ship him and Ivy, lol. But guessing that won't ever happen, as she's eleven, and he is fifteen. Aw. But still, I hope. There are also lots of other people in this one. Like their grandmother. I liked her. But she wasn't written fully well enough for me. Still, I liked her a lot. And Ethel too. Liked a lot of the others too.I'm really glad that I read this book. I hadn't heard of it before the publisher sent it to me, ack. So glad that I got it in the mail. Because then I got to read this gorgeous book. I'm really curious about the next books too. Hoping book two will be better at the things I disliked in this one. Fingers crossed. Either way, I'm so excited. Huge thank you to the publisher for sending me this ARC to review while I was in Chicago. The Crooked Sixpence is full of adventure and has such a stunning story. I enjoyed it a lot.

It's also easy to notice the similarities it shares to the Harry Potter series, invisibility item, a manor that will reveal itself only to a member of the family and maps that show you the location of people to name a few. Yet, there are differences as well. There's no Hogwarts School of Magic, and really no wands or magic per se. There is a world of Uncommon objects that have certain abilities, like a button that can heal you, and bells that can speak and give directions. I also like the premise that uncommon objects hold a piece of a person's soul and certain Uncommon people, Whisperers can sense these uncommon objects. There's also a bit of a mystery to solve linked to Ivy and Seb's Granma's car accident and their families past in Lundinor. Of all the characters, Scratch, the bicycle bell with his back-to-fronted speaking problem was one of my favorites, he adds much of the humor. I also really want to learn more about Valian, and about his scouting abilities and what other uncommon objects are out there in Lundinor. There's even some delightfully creepy characters amongst the Dirge, and action that kept the story moving along nicely. An excellent introduction to this new series."}, {"userName": "Eva Lucia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36321494-eva-lucia", "userReview": "Also posted on Eva Lucias blogTak til H\u00f8st & S\u00f8n for anmeldereksemplaret!Den b\u00f8jede m\u00f8nt (De Ualmindelige #1) af Jennifer Bell er en bog, som blev ved med at dukke op alle steder.

Men f\u00f8rst finder de to s\u00f8skende, Ivy og Seb, deres bedstemors hus i en m\u00e6rkelig tilstand, hvor alt er blevet rodet igennem og de finder desuden en besked skrevet af en flyvende fjer.De finder snart ud af, at bedstemoren har noget med den magiske verden at g\u00f8re, men det bliver en lang s\u00f8gen p\u00e5 at finde ud af, hvordan det hele h\u00e6nger sammen. Her er man som l\u00e6ser s\u00e5 heldig at f\u00f8lge med som fluen p\u00e5 v\u00e6ggen og det er sp\u00e6ndende, s\u00e5 man bladrer sider hurtigt.Det er en roman, som blander realisme og magi. Der er magiske toiletb\u00f8rster, som bruges som v\u00e5ben og b\u00f8jede m\u00f8nter (og listen forts\u00e6tter!) Sproget er humoristisk og taler til mange m\u00e5lgrupper, b\u00e5de b\u00f8rn og voksne. Beskrivelserne er spot on, s\u00e5 alt f\u00f8les levende, hvilket det sjovt nok er (= mange magiske og sk\u00f8re ting). Intet er som det ser ud og Ivy og Seb bliver ofte n\u00f8dt til at t\u00e6nke ud af boksen. Det er underholdende, men man m\u00e5 ogs\u00e5 holde tungen lige i munden.Jeg vil anbefale denne roman til folk, som er vild med Harry Potter. Det skal lige siges, at Den b\u00f8jede m\u00f8nt og Harry Potter IKKE kan sammenlignes, men jeg synes, at Den b\u00f8jede m\u00f8nt giver en feel good-f\u00f8lelse a la Harry Potter. Der er magi, sk\u00f8nne karakterer og det er et univers, som hurtigt giver mening, fordi den blander hverdagselementer og magi. Det fungerer rigtig godt.

This hasn't affected Ivy and her brother Seb's life much, although they are familiar with the story, and with the only photograph her grandma Sylvie has from before. When Sylvie falls and has to go to the hospital, odd things start to happen. Creepy people show up at the hospital, and Ivy and Seb end up getting sucked through a suitcase into an alternate London, Lundinor, where there are markets that sell \"uncommon\" objects; things that have bits of people's spirits in them. Ivy can tell just by touching an object if it has this quality, and she starts to find out secrets about her grandmother's past. There is a sinister organization called the Dirge, who were looking for the Uncommon Goods. It turns out that Ivy's grandfather was part of it. The immediate threats are contained by the end of the book, Sylvie starts to remember a little about what when on in her previous life, and Ivy and Seb are prepared to find out more and return to Lundinor for more adventures.Strengths: I hadn't wanted to read this book, but once I started, the exquisite world building sucked me right in. The blurb on the cover says \"Part Tim Burton, part J.K.Rowling\", and I have to agree. Bell did an excellent job of distilling facets of Harry Potter that were appealing (saving the world, alternate universe, quirky clothes and delicious food) but putting them into the story in a fresh way. Uncommoners are collectors of things, so their outfits are \"Hobsmatch\", lemon squeezers are lights, and Sylvie's ancestral house can only be located by someone in the family. The threat of the Dirge is serious, but not overly scary. Valian is a good guide, and Ivy and Seb get along. Unlike The Iron Trial series, another attempt at duplicating the intriguing aspects of Harry Potter, this has a fairly pleasant world and MUCH better food. I feel like I'm not doing justice to this one. Weaknesses: The parents were sent off on a trip at the beginning, which I guess was necessary, but I would have liked to see them included in the adventure a little bit. What I really think: I don't buy every fantasy book out there because there are SOOOOO many, but I will be very happy to purchase this one.

The sheer scope of imagination and how inventive every use for otherwise mundane objects was truly delightful, I especially loved the buttons that could heal people, with each hole representing the amount of times it could be used. Also, the talking bells were fabulous. The main character Ivy was also a great protagonist. A firm sense of morality, but also with a streak of pragmatism that is rare to see in a lot of heroes. Even knowing she might end up losing her parents, Ivy went on to choose the lives of hundreds of thousands instead. It was a refreshing change of pace from protags throwing themselves into the hands of the villains over every minor acquaintance. The character that felt the weakest to me was her brother, he just felt a little shallower, which is why the book dropped a star.Other than that!

Protagonist was just so slow (like, slower than Harry), and like I said before there were zero likeable characters besides a bike bell with a speech impediment, and that's barely even in it.Kids' books do not need to be so.. dumb. ~Silly~ is great, but this book was so dumbed down it was almost patronising."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3014918-amanda", "userReview": "I came across the cover illustrator's art on tumblr a couple weeks ago, saw he was illustrating this book, then came across a free advance copy at a work conference, and naturally, had to pick it up.The world Jennifer Bell created is quirky and original and fun. The main character reminds me of a young Hermione Granger, but less smart-alecky. Some parts were a little predictable, other parts had me guessing wrong. It sets up neatly for a series - it's a planned trilogy, and goes along at a nice pace. I also enjoyed a girl protagonist, younger than her two boy sidekicks. :)"}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/663928-leah", "userReview": "I can't do it anymore.

It's a cracking start to what promises to be a brilliant, well-loved series. The protagonist is Ivy Sparrow, a kind girl with a strong sense of her own values. Ivy has unruly brown hair, yellow wellies and a quietly confident, positive, problem-solving attitude. Of course, there are many, many different types of 'strong female character' (a term I am not a particular fan of) and Ivy is definitely one of them. From the moment Ivy and her brother Seb go on the run from strange policemen brandishing toilet brushes, I knew something 'uncommon' was afoot. But my curiosity had already been piqued a few pages before, when a feather quill materialised in the Sparrow's Granma's kitchen, writing a message all on its own: 'We can see you now.' The moment gave me tingles. I think Jennifer Bell has done such a brilliant job of tapping into the imaginative world of the child - that unwavering sense that there is more to the world than we can see. As soon as Uncommon objects were introduced, I had such an uncanny feeling that I'd felt that way about objects myself, as a child - that I'd felt there was more to some of them than met the eye. Children who have also had those thoughts will adore this book, and others will view the world differently after reading it. This is some of the best, most ingenious world-building I've ever read. From Hobsmatch (I'm already planning my outfits - I think I'll be including a tutu, riding boots, elbow patches and a fireman's hat) to Hundred Punch, lemon squeezer lighting and Uncommon flying rugs, this book is exactly the kind of warm, comforting (but exciting) treat I needed. Scratch, the Uncommon bicycle bell, is one of my favourite characters from recent fiction - he's so funny, kind and endearing. The world is rich and exciting, the mystery is cleverly developed and the heroine is brave and loyal and full of positive thinking. As Sebastian, Ivy's brother, says at the end of the book: 'I'll never look at a toilet brush the same way again.' Perfect for fans of Roald Dahl, JK Rowling and Edward Carey, plus fans of gorgeously rich mystery stories like the Sinclair's Mysteries by Katherine Woodfine."}, {"userName": "Rogerio", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34766635-rogerio", "userReview": "In this story a Wizard community lives underneath London. Dead and living mix and the power is mostly derived from common objects with \"uncommon\" use (this is the amusing part). The story doesn't flow very well and the author does not make it \"plausible\" enough. While I would read Harry Potter over and over, this is like a bad copy I felt like stopping midway. \"Muggles\" are called \"muckers\", the secret way to travel between London and \"Lundinor\" is inside a suitcase - however it is not very clear how these two worlds are connected in Uncommoners. The literarly issue with the book is that the author is forced to create a lot of different storylines to try explain what is happening. Once the storyline has done its work of explaining an event, it is then abandoned creating a pacthwork of unresolved plot lines. Just a few examples: the races of the dead, the whisperers workshop, the Dirge themselves, Ivy's family story, the Uncommon Good found, the story of the bell shop, the Quarters, the Trade fair, etc. The author also started up a whole world of characters (e.g. selkies, talking bells, guardians, Dirge, police, Wrench family and other people etc.) which makes the story all over the place. It might take quite a few books and a lot of writing ability to turn it into a sensible series if ever. It is also quite difficult to buy into the heroes's personalities. Their actions and thinking don't seem to act their age."}, {"userName": "Aeicha ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6075458-aeicha", "userReview": "After an accident involving their beloved Grandma, eleven year old Ivy Sparrow and her fourteen year old brother Seb find themselves on an unforgettable adventure in a world like no other. Underneath London there is another world, an uncommon world, called Lundinor, where uncommon objects possess extraordinary powers and the people who trade these objects are called uncommoners. When Ivy and Seb find themselves in Ludinor they discover that their family is a part of a decades long mystery and only they, and their new-maybe-friend, Valian, can solve the mystery and stop a terrible group known as the Dirge.Jennifer Bell\u2019s The Crooked Sixpence (The Uncommoners #1) is a fast-paced, enchanting new middle-grade, bubbling with adventure, imagination, and non-stop excitement! From beginning to end, this book charmed and entertained me completely.What a fun and creative world and story Jennifer Bell as created in The Crooked Sixpence! Young readers will be captivated by Bell\u2019s sparkling and witty storytelling and absolutely fascinated by the world of uncommon objects and even uncommoner people. The complex, innovative world of Ludinor, reminiscent of the world within Harry Potter, is vividly and wonderfully brought to life. I just loved exploring this fantastical and amusing world with Ivy and Seb. From talking bells, to drinks with a hundred flavors, ghosts, wicked yo-yos, and more, this world is overflowing with the unexpected and the downright cool. And I really enjoyed all of the engaging and interesting characters in The Crooked Sixpence, from brave Ivy, to inquisitive Seb, mischievous Valian, adorable Scratch, and some fun baddies.Readers will easily be swept away by Ivy and Seb\u2019s adventures in Ludinor, eagerly and enthusiastically turning The Crooked Sixpence\u2019s pages, and will definitely want to return for more!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20670942-stephanie", "userReview": "While many books are billed as the \"new Harry Potter\" I liked the twists this one gave to the storyline. There's still elements of the chosen one battling darkness - but the parts I liked most were the \"uncommon\" objects and what they could do. Scratch was a particular favorite! Rated down because a main plot point was added quite late in the book, making me feel like I lost something along the way. Still will wait eagerly for the next book in the series!"}, {"userName": "Irina (Beautiful pages)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34163553-irina-beautiful-pages", "userReview": "Really nice and cute book with lots of adventures and things happening.
