Ayer's choice in essays gives the reader a very diverse array of the varying viewpoints and opinions within the general group of logical positivism, and also does a great job at explaining the views of the Vienna Circle and their offspring. The essays contained within this collection are a must-read for anyone interested in 20th century philosophy, analytic philosophy, or logical positivism."}, {"userName": "Joshua Stein", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein", "userReview": "Ayer's collection on Logical Positivism is very good, though it doesn't focus as heavily on the original texts from the Vienna Circle as I would have liked. Still, Ayer is an amazing resource on the subject and the collection that he edited is very well done.The critiques of ethics are especially good, though they tend to Ayer's emotivism as opposed to alternate versions of non-cognitivism. It's still really worth the read, if you have the time and the interest in the subject matter."}, {"userName": "Chant", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20616894-chant", "userReview": "AJ Ayer collects some very interesting and variety of papers from philosophers usually associated with logical positivism/logical atomism. Of course the movement is now a relic of the first half of the 20th century, but it is still is fun and interesting to read some papers from these philosophers. One of my favorite papers from this collection would be Carnap's 'the elimination of metaphysics through logical analysis of language' because he completely shits on the then contemporary \"metaphysicians\" and in particular Heidegger and his usage of vague and groundless assertions. If you can find this book and interested in early analytic philosophy then you should read this book."}], "description": "", "title": "Logical Positivism", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/845291.Logical_Positivism", "average": 3.91, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347512059l/845291.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7863309.A_J_Ayer", "name": "A.J.
