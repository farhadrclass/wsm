A dark, dystopian future where young men are gunned down for doing nothing wrong. Imagine trying to live your life with the constant knowledge that you could be murdered for\u2026 wearing the wrong clothes\u2026 looking \u201cshady\u201d\u2026 or having the wrong colour skin. Imagine living this nightmare and STILL being told that it doesn\u2019t happen anymore. That everyone is equal and, actually, YOU are given an advantage by affirmative action programs. But this isn\u2019t a dark dystopia. It\u2019s the world we live in. Maybe it\u2019s not a world I am forced to deal with. Or you. Or you over there. But it\u2019s the world many black Americans face every day.Dear Martin introduces us to Justyce - a strong and important voice in YA. There are so few YA books with POC narrators and especially lacking are those with non-white teen boys, so this book is particularly needed. Through third person narration alternating with Justyce's letters to Martin Luthor King Jr., we get insight into some of the experiences had by black teenage boys.For those looking for books to complement The Hate U Give, this is a good place to start. While The Hate U Give looks at the shooting of unarmed black men and boys through the eyes of a female witness, Dear Martin instead offers what it is like to be one of those racially-profiled black men. It is not just about shooting, though. This book explores smaller but deeply hurtful acts of racially-charged aggression, such as the anger held by white students over affirmative action programs. Or the demand to \"stop being so sensitive\" in the face of race-related jokes. It is especially interesting when the author also considers the animosity Justyce receives from the black boys in his neighbourhood. He finds himself torn between the need to be true to his roots and his desire to succeed in a world that demands he play the white man's game to get ahead. All that being said, it's not a perfect book. While many complex issues are considered, some aspects are simplistic and lacking in nuance. Justyce is an unquestionably nice, well-mannered boy who wants to follow in the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d footsteps of MLK. While it is important to deconstruct the aggressive thug stereotype associated with young black men, teens this mild-mannered and uncomplicated are hard to believe in. I was a shy bookworm and even I had more bite than Justyce.In contrast, all of the racism is very overt. The cops all stomp around punching black guys in the face and using the n-word, while Justyce's white classmates are so stupidly and openly racist to the point where one of them thinks it's funny to go to a party dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member. Does this level of abhorrent behaviour happen? Absolutely! But the real problem we face today is more insidious, more subtle, hiding behind a \"I just feared for my life, your honour\". In reality, it is much more complex than good vs. bad where the bad wears a white hood and shouts racist insults. That is why young black men are so at risk and their murderers so likely to escape justice - because the most dangerous racists no longer wear the t-shirt.I would have also liked to see more of a challenge to the misogyny. I wouldn't say it's glorified, but it is never addressed when Manny, a black boy, says he dislikes black girls because he\u2019s never met any that aren\u2019t ghetto and full of attitude. Seems like a strange message to send out in a book of this kind.But the good definitely outweighs the bad. Problems aside, this is a short, quick read that packs a huge punch. I feel like I'll be thinking about it for a long time.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Emma Giordano", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30604861-emma-giordano", "userReview": "5/5 Stars! LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH.CW: racism, police brutalityDear Martin had me captivated the entire time, I seriously could not put it down. I finished it in under 3 hours so if you are looking for a short yet intense read, this is the one for you!I feel I avoided Dear Martin for a few months because I assumed the entire novel was written in letters to Dr. King, which is not a format I prefer to read. I was pleasantly surprised to find the letters complimented the chronological storytelling, and was a great addition in my opinion. I feel Justyce\u2019s story would be incomplete without a place to share his unfiltered thoughts with a figure he aims to emulate.Dear Martin does not shy away from much-needed conversations about racism and racial profiling in America, but it also delves into conversations about toxic masculinity and gangs. I feel this novel successfully accomplishes approaching these tough issues by displaying a variety of perspectives. These discussions are raw, uncensored, and full of truth we cannot turn a blind eye to.I also loved that while this book deals with serious topics, the character dynamics do often bring enough humor to the story to balance out the intensity. I thoroughly enjoyed Justyce\u2019s narration \u2013 It was so satisfying to read from the perspective of an intelligent, self/socially aware teen.All together, I loved Dear Martin. I think my only critique is attributed to the fact that I wish it was longer! I would have loved more scenes, more letters to Dr. King, more development from side characters. Otherwise, it was a really fantastic read I would definitely recommend."}, {"userName": "destiny \u2620 howling libraries", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15335689-destiny-howling-libraries", "userReview": "NOTE: As a white woman, I am incapable of fully understanding the issues that plague black individuals today. I recognize my privilege and try to learn something new every single day, and I am so grateful for authors like Nic Stone who can teach me new ways of seeing society. That said, my opinion on this book is honestly so much less important than own-voice reviewers' words. If you or someone you know is an own-voice reviewer of this book and would like your review to be featured in my blog post, please message me here on Goodreads or DM me on twitter because I would love to share your words. First and foremost, let me tell you that this is one of the most \nimportant\n stories that I have ever had the mixed pleasure and heartache of reading. Justyce's story is one of societal racism, police brutality, toxic masculinity, and privilege. His letters to Martin Luther King, Jr. beautifully depict the pain and difficulty that comes with being a black individual in the United States today.It is so incredibly intersectional and finds a way to address so many talking points that many of my peers - of all ages - could benefit from seeing through this book's lens. No matter your political stance, I would highly encourage every single person to pick up a copy of Dear Martin and go into it with your eyes and mind as wide open as possible.\n\n\"How do I work against this, Martin? Getting real with you, I feel a little defeated. Knowing there are people who don't want me to succeed is depressing. Especially coming from two directions.\"\n\nSomething exceptionally interesting to me about Nic Stone's writing in this book is her decision to address not only racism, but also the mindset that some individuals in the black community have regarding themselves and other POC. There is a lot of explanation given for how, in a nutshell, once a group of people have been put down over and over for so long, in such painful ways, and have been shown that no amount of effort they can put forth will be recognized as equal, it can be easy to feel defeated and hopeless - sometimes to the point of giving up.Justyce's reaction to his unlawful arrest, and the ways that his privileged, wealthy white classmates treat him, broke my heart. He becomes so hopeless at times. Despite being incredibly brilliant and hard-working, Jus questions his own worth at points, asking, \"Am I ever going to get anywhere? Is this battle worth fighting?\"\n\n\"Do I just take what they dish out, try to stop being \"so sensitive\"? What do I do when my very identity is being mocked by people who refuse to admit there's a problem?\"\n\nWhat may have been the most painful aspect of reading Dear Martin for me, was watching the way his so-called \"friends\" treated him. The microaggressions escalated steadily to blatant cruelty, and so much of it looked so familiar to things I saw and heard people say firsthand, growing up in the Atlanta metro. I'm so ashamed to say this, but there were even comments that I remembered making similar assumptions to as a young teen, and seeing it on paper like that brutally reminded me of how many people I have hurt with my carelessness in years past.\n\n\"My dudes... they're like family to me. They've got my back as long as I have theirs.\"\n\nOne of many topics Nic Stone handled beautifully was the portrayal of gangs, and the reasoning for why so many teens get sucked into them: at the root of many gangs lies a family, something to hold on to and to protect yourself with. In a society that has ceaselessly attacked the individuals it deems \"other\", is it any surprise that individuals like Justyce's childhood friend would seek solace in gangs?The entire gang discussion in Dear Martin also highlights some serious struggles with toxic masculinity and the way it can effect young people in particular, leading young men to believe that proving their worth means violence, aggression, etc. While it's not a topic that is focused on very clearly in this book, it's worth mentioning.Among other less-discussed topics in the book, there's time taken to dive into sexism (like Justyce's frequent remarks to Manny that he is \"such a girl\", which is later challenged), misogynoir and internalized racism (as Justyce's best friend, Manny, admits that he struggles to find black women attractive, and goes on to categorize them stereotypically and unfairly), and discrimination and how it can impact both sides (Justyce has a crush on his best friend - a Jewish girl named SJ - but refuses to pursue it due to his mother's insistence that no black son of hers should have anything to do with a white girl).There's also a heavy line of discussion about police brutality, which we get to see somewhat from both sides: Justyce wonders if one cop's racism is influenced by having seen his partner shot by a black teen months prior - blame is never 100% placed on either side, and nobody's actions are justified. As a result of police brutality, Justyce's best friend's father joins a protest group (seemingly similar to Black Lives Matter), and is forced to resign from his management position as a result of being seen with \"those people\". I know that BLM and police brutality is a hot topic of controversy here in the states lately, and I thought Nic Stone made her points flawlessly.\n\n\"In that moment, when I thought I was dying, it hit me: despite how good of a dude Martin was, they still killed him, man.\"\n\nThis quote in particular was what finally broke me in Dear Martin. I have grown so weary of individuals claiming that marginalized groups - particularly black individuals - don't protest \"the right way\". If they stand silent, it's wrong. If they kneel, it's wrong. If they wear t-shirts and hold signs, it's wrong. This is so incredibly relevant to the turmoil facing our nation today, and at a certain point, you have to wake up and realize: it isn't about the protests - it never was. It's about the skin color of the protesters.I feel like there's so much more that I could say about Dear Martin. I'm sitting here with tears streaking down my cheeks, and all I want to do is say any combination of the right words to convince you to pick this book up, to lose yourself in this story the way I did. To go into it with open eyes and to learn something from Nic Stone's experiences. If there could ever be a contemporary title that I could convince you to get a copy of, let it be Dear Martin.Content warnings: racism, police brutality, violence, death, misogyny/misogynoir.All quotes are taken from an ARC.

And so smol...it literally arrived in the mail and I nearly lost it in the packaging. But while I do have some quibbles about the size, ultimately I think it's AMAZING that 200 pages can pack this massive punch. This is the kind of #BlackLivesMatter book that's super important for everyone to read. And as the author's note says, it's: \"...an attempt to examine current affairs through the lens of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s teachings.\" Which was SO great to read and learn about.I also really adored Justyce! He's like just doing his best and he's super smart and the world just kicks him down. I also liked how he's on the brink of graduation, because it's really nice reading about teens who know what they're doing (HE'S GOING TO YALE) and are off to like change the world. Like, go Justyce. I really admire this dude.It's of course not an \"easy\" story either. It's going to thump you in the feels. And the court case scene totally blew me away with how unfair and tangled it was...but like the writing. This book is full of intelligence and it's super well written!ALOS IT'S WRITTEN IN 3RD PERSON / PRESENT TENSE WHICH IS MY FAVOURITE. You know how hard it is to find books in this style?!? I'm happpppy.OK so the ONLY quibble I have is that --> being so short, it was hard to SEE everything. I missed out on all the details, the mannerisms, the facial quirks, the smells and sights and tastes. The book is probably 80% straight dialogue? (Often in like a screen-writing format.) So I LIKED that, but (for me personally) I prefer writing that fleshes out the world as well. This also made a lot of the secondary characters are to \"get to know\" because we just see their dialogue and that's it.But hey. I love dialogue also!!Definitely an important narrative that can't be talked about enough. The world needs to change and I'm so glad #ownvoices authors are putting their stories out there to make a difference. It tackles racism and classism head on and it's full of unfairness and character development and letters and hope. <3\"You ever consider that maybe you not supposed to 'fit'?

There\u2019s honestly not much else to say about this book. Despite being incredibly short, I think Dear Martin speaks for itself about racism and hatred and prejudice. It\u2019s hard to write a book that makes a reader feel, but reading this book just made me feel like I was being punched in the gut, over and over. This was just so emotionally real. While the characters may not get many specific traits, they all feel so much like real people. It takes a lot of talent to make characters feel so true in so few pages. Where this book truly exceeds, though, is the thematics. I'd utterly second my friend Destiny's words as to the themes of internalized racism. What I specifically loved about this book, and something I'm not sure you'll get from any other book, is the emphasis on Justyce's feeling like a \npolitical debate rather than a person.\n Holy shit, this is the realest feeling as marginalized person. It's like your personhood is being taken away. You are nothing but the thing that cuts you off, not to your friends, to your enemies, to your teachers. You are there to be a political pawn. You are there to be a counterexample. None of your opinions are your own - they are your group's opinions, because god forbid we think of marginalized people as anything but a monolith. There is so much about this here, done in a way that's sensitive and kind. I think no one put it better than Adriana @PerpetualPages in  their review - this book asks, and better yet, doesn't try to perfectly answer, whether the time for respectability politics is over. I feel like people are going to ignore this because of The Hate U Give, an equally important and fantastic book: and can I just say: you shouldn't. Yes, they're both kind of about #blacklivesmatter, but they deal with different facets of racism and in completely different ways. The Hate U Give deals with cop violence and racial profiling, yes, but I'd argue that its focus lies on how to stand up in a society filled with systematic racism. Meanwhile, Dear Martin focuses on toxic masculinity and the socialization of black boys in our society, the way in which they are taught they are more criminal than everyone else in some indefinable way. Both have slightly different focuses when discussing racism, both are very different books, and \nboth are totally worth reading.\nIt wasn't quite a five star book for me; the beginning felt a little rough, in particular. After a heartbreaking and near-perfect first couple chapters, the middle section is meditative and dialogue-full with a romance that feels somewhat bland. But in the end, it all works to the book's advantage. The second half of this book makes everything worth it. I truly felt so much towards the end. And in fact, the ending of this book is one of the best book endings I have ever read. It is so full of hope - hope for change, hope for continued life, hope for us to continue growing as people and as nations. A lot of the changes we can make in the future need to be guided along by people in positions of privilege. We need to be here. It's our responsibility to support fantastic books like this that speak to the importance of ending racism.

It was refreshing to see a male PoC as the narrator in a YA book, too! And the comparison to The Hate U Give is inevitable, but I don't think it needs to be any sort of contest. Both of these books are amazing. They both focus on police brutality & racism, but this one does take a different approach and weaves in some very important questions of toxic masculinity, sexism, and identity. First of all, I'm obviously white and realllllly can't speak on some of the important discussions covered in this book. (Exhibit A: a white classmate points out that \"we'll never be seen as criminals before we're seen as people\"). I'd say to check out some #ownvoices reviews & posts -- let me know in the comments if you have one I can link to! I'll just say that it was a powerful read for me and I think this is a book that should be available in high school classrooms for sure. My favorite part was probably Justyce's letters to Martin Luther King Jr spread throughout the story because they really strengthened his character's voice. I loved him!! Justyce seemed like a really sweet & realistic teen. I loved how there was such a strong message of hope and humanity in some really heavy areas, too. The story was painful to read and I actually teared up at the complete unfairness (ok that word seems like a massive understatement)... it's all SO well done. It's the kind of book that gets you fired up to see some serious change asap, yet also makes you want to just sit there hugging it for highlighting so many things that desperately needed to be said in media like YA.I did kind of wish that the white cops and idiotic classmates hadn't been such simplified caricatures, though, because that took some potential impact out of the story for me. Their actions were beyond horrible but seemed more like a cartoon version of \"bad\" at times and didn't entirely blend with the complexity of the rest of the story. But that's a very minor detail. What is there is still a very strong plot that I completely recommend to teachers, librarians, and... well, everyone.

Because that\u2019s exactly what I felt when I opened this book and read the first chapter. By the second I was crying, and smiling, laughing, and in so much pain.This book is mostly about Justyce, a seventeen-year-old black boy, trying to understand where he stands in his own life, what is opinion on racial inequalities is, what does it mean for him to be black in this white supremacist world. And it sucks. So much. Because he\u2019s surrounded by these white \u2018I don\u2019t see colour\u2019 dudes who think racial inequalities don\u2019t exist anymore and can\u2019t even realise they benefit of white privileges.Justyce is a complex character, he goes through such an important journey throughout this book : going from this \u2018let\u2019s do anything to be integrated\u2019 kid to this \u2018I\u2019m done being someone I\u2019m not\u2019 one. And it\u2019s so heartbreaking to witness this journey, because Justyce has to face such a harsh reality, it hurts him every single of it.\u2028The moment that really changes everything for him is when he\u2019s handcuffed fore helping his drunk ex-girlfriend to sit in her car \u2026 and a cop assumes he\u2019s carjacking. Because he\u2019s black and wearing a hoodie. How fucked up is that? He\u2019s automatically assumed threatening because of his skin colour, don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re all equals because that\u2019s bullshit and you know it. Justyce knows it, every single people of colour me included know it, so why is it so hard for a huge number \u2014 if not the majority \u2014 of white people to understand there is an actual problem going on and it won\u2019t get better until they start opening their eyes? I\u2019m not sorry for being harsh in my words, because the really is harsher, and I\u2019m not there to make racist people feel comfortable. None of us are.This book has a lot of extremely interesting side characters, and I have to admit my two favourites were SJ and Doc. SJ is this white Jewish girl, she\u2019s so fierce and head-strong, she\u2019s aware of her privileges and uses them to make this fucked up world a better place. Doc is a biracial teacher, and he gives the best advices, you could just write them all on post-its and put them on your walls because trust me you need them. But there is also this one character I didn\u2019t expect to end up liking : Jared. Asshole Jared. Mr-I\u2019m-better-than-you-because-I\u2019m-white Jared. It\u2019s interesting to see how something awful that happens in this book affects him for the better. But people of colour shouldn\u2019t have to suffer for white people to open their eyes and start acting like decent people.\u201cYou can\u2019t change how other people think and act, but you\u2019re in full control of you.

It will not go into extreme length about, for instance, affirmative action, but it will talk about it in a way that makes the reader understand easily and then want to talk about it themselves by using their own examples.Martin Luther King is someone who is mentioned at least once by every teacher you'll encounter, especially your Humanities ones. Not to be confused with Martin Luther, who is a very different historical figure.

Thank you very much.\nActual rating: 3.5 starsWriting this review won\u2019t be easy because of this book destroyed my heart and feelings. Before starting reading Dear Martin, I automatically compared it to The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, another YA contemporary book focused on #BlackLivesMatter movement. For the ones who don\u2019t know what this movement is, it is based on racism towards black people and one of central themes is protesting against police, wherever a black person (especially unarmed teenagers) is killed by the ones who should make justice. The protests are placed mainly in The United States. Before reading both of these two novels, since I\u2019m not American, I didn\u2019t know so much about it. It isn\u2019t okay, it\u2019s important to know and fortunately I learnt everything I know from these two books.Let me tell a thing: I\u2019m glad authors such as Nic Stone and Angie Thomas exist. I\u2019m glad they published these books, both seriously important that I recommend them to EVERYONE (especially to white people!). Putting in the shoes of black people, black boy teenager in this book, made me understand a lot of their condition from when white people tend to judge them just for the colour of their skin. Of course I couldn\u2019t feel it properly, but this novel made me reflex about a lot of things and changed one of the prospective of my life. Those are the books that I love the most: the ones who make me think and, because of that, never really leave me. For the people who are guessing if this book is like The Hate U Give (before reading I was guessing it too), I\u2019d say to read them both because, although both of them are about #BlackLivesMatter, they are quite different.What does Dear Martin talk about? The story follows the life of a black seventeen-year-old boy named Justyce who just ended up arrested while he was helping his ex drunk girlfriend to get home safe, when a policeman saw him and, because of fact he is black, he was automatically considered as a \u2018thug\u2019. After that night, he starts writing letters to Martin Luther King Jr. and asking him for advice such as what happened that night and what happens, daily, at his school.Pretty much everyone knows who Martin Luther King Jr. was and how he fight racism to get black people rights in a non-violent way that inspires the main character. In the course of the all book he asks himself, and others too, What Martin would do? Or Why be good if people see him as a criminal anyway? I have to admit, those arguments were pretty philosophical.\n\n\u201cSo why even try to be \u2018good\u2019?\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t change how other people think and act, but you\u2019re in full control of you. When it comes down to it, the only question that matters is this: If nothing in the world ever changes, what type of man are you gonna be?\u201d\n\nIn the book there are other aspects who are treated like friendship and romance. Unbelievably, I just found out a book where friendship between two boys is written great: Justyce has a best friend, Manny, he is black as well, and I really enjoyed how the writer characterized their friendship.I\u2019d like to talk about my favourite character in the novel, Sarah-Jane. She is white, Justyce\u2019s debate friend. Most of all, she truly supported race equality and always defended black people. For example, when Justyce got an higher score than a white guy to enter to Yale, he complains about how impossible that thing is. These are my favourite quotes of her:\n\n\u201cBottom line, nobody sees us [white people] and automatically assumes we\u2019re up to no good.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll [white people] never be seen as criminals before we\u2019re seen as people.\u201d\n\nWow, see why I love her? More people like her should exist.Why I didn\u2019t give it more stars:There is so much slang in this book and I, since I\u2019m not an English-speaker person, couldn\u2019t understand some parts of it. Do really American people use slang as much as the characters of this book? I don\u2019t think there should be so much in a book.Besides that, I didn\u2019t enjoy how the writing sometimes was. To be more specific, there are parts who seem like a script. I didn\u2019t appreciate that writing choice.Anyway, I hope to read more books by Nic Stone because I think she\u2019ll write other amazing books that will definitely be worthy.

Prima di iniziare a leggere Dear Martin, l\u2019ho automaticamente paragonato a The Hate U Give di Angie Thomas (che \u00e8 uscito in Italia lo scorso mese, mi sembra), un altro Young Adult contemporaneo basato sul movimento #BlackLivesMatter. Per coloro che non conoscessero questo movimento, \u00e8 fondato sul razzismo contro le persone di colore e uno dei temi principali \u00e8 protestare contro la polizia, ogni volta che una persona di colore (specialmente minorenni non armati) viene uccisa da chi dovrebbe fare giustizia. Le proteste sono maggiormente svolte negli Stati Uniti. Prima di leggere entrambi questi due romanzi, dato che non sono americana, non ne sapevo molto. Non va bene. \u00c8 importante conoscere e per fortuna ho imparato tutto ci\u00f2 che so da questi due libri.Lasciatemi dire una cosa: sono contenta che esitano autrici come Nic Stone e Angie Thomas. Sono contenta che abbiano pubblicato questi libri, entrambi davvero importanti, i quali consiglio a TUTTI (specialmente alle persone con la carnagione chiara. I bianchi, per intenderci!). Mettersi nei panni delle persone di colore, in questo libro di un ragazzo di colore, mi ha fatto capire molto della loro condizione a partire da quando i bianchi tendono a giudicarli solo per il colore della loro pelle. Ovviamente non ho posso capire completamente, ma questo romanzo mi ha fatto riflettere su molte cose e cambiato una delle prospettive della mia vita. Questi sono i libri che amo di pi\u00f9: quelli che mi fanno pensare e, per questo motivo, non mi lasciano mai. Per coloro che si stanno domandando se questo libro \u00e8 come The Hate U Give (prima di leggerlo me lo chiedevo anche io), direi di leggerli entrambi perch\u00e9, nonostante entrambi siano sul #BlackLivesMatter, sono abbastanza diversi.Di cosa parla Dear Martin? La storia segue la vita di un ragazzo di colore di diciassette anni chiamato Justyce che finisce in arresto mentre stava aiutando la sua ex ragazza ubriaca a tornare a casa sana e salva, quando un poliziotto lo vede e, a causa del fatto che sia di colore, viene automaticamente considerato come un \u2018teppista\u2019. Dopo quella notte, inizia a scrivere lettere a Martin Luther King Jr. e a chiedergli consigli per esempio su cosa \u00e8 accaduto quella notte e cosa succede, giornalmente, alla sua scuola.Una buona maggioranza di persone sa chi \u00e8 Martin Luther King Jr. e come ha combattuto contro il razzismo per ottenere i diritti per le persone di colore in un modo non violento che inspira il personaggio principale. Nel corso di tutto il libro si domanda, e anche ad altri, Cosa farebbe Martin? O Perch\u00e9 essere buono se le persone lo vedono comunque come un criminale? Deve ammetterlo, questi argomenti sono abbastanza filosofici.\n\n\u201cQuindi perch\u00e9 addirittura provare a essere \u2018buoni\u2019?\u201d \u201cNon puoi cambiare come le altre pensano o come si comportano, ma tu sei totalmente in controllo di te stesso. Quando si ritorna a questo, l\u2019unica domanda che importa \u00e8 questa: se niente nel mondo cambia, quale tipo di uomo hai intenzione di essere?\u201d\n\nNel libro ci sono altri aspetti che sono trattati come l\u2019amicizia e la storia d\u2019amore. Incredibilmente, ho appena scoperto un libro dove l\u2019amicizia tra due ragazzi \u00e8 scritta in modo fantastico: Justyce ha un migliore amico, Manny, anche lui di colore, e mi \u00e8 davvero piaciuto come la scrittrice abbia caratterizzato la loro amicizia .Vorrei parlare del mio personaggio preferito nel romanzo, Sarah-Jane. \u00c8 bianca, un\u2019amica di dibattito di Justyce. Pi\u00f9 di tutto, lei davvero supporta l\u2019eguaglianza tra razze e ha sempre difeso le persone di colore. Per esempio, quando Justyce ha ottenuto un punteggio pi\u00f9 alto di un ragazzo bianco per entrare a Yale, si lamenta (il ragazzo bianco) di quanto possa essere impossibile questa cosa. Ecco le mie citazioni preferite del suo personaggio:\n\n\u201cIl punto \u00e8 che, nessuno vede noi [persone bianche] e automaticamente pensa che non abbiamo buone intenzioni.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNoi [persone binache] non verremo mai viste come criminali prima di essere viste come persone.\u201d\n\nWow, riuscite a capire perch\u00e9 la amo? Pi\u00f9 persone come lei dovrebbero esistere .Perch\u00e9 non gli ho dato pi\u00f9 stelline:C\u2019\u00e8 davvero molto slang in questo libro e io, dato che non sono una persona che \u00e8 nata in un paese dove si parla inglese, non ho potuto capire alcune parti di esso. Davvero gli americani usano cos\u00ec tanto slang come i personaggi di questo libro? Non credo ce ne dovrebbe essere cos\u00ec tanto in un libro.A parte quello, non mi \u00e8 piaciuto come fosse lo stile di scrittura a volte. Per essere pi\u00f9 specifica, ci sono parti che sembrano come un copione . Non ho apprezzato quella scelta di scrittura.Comunque, spero di leggere pi\u00f9 libri scritti da Nic Stone perch\u00e9 credo che scriver\u00e0 altri meravigliosi libri che ne varranno decisamente la pena.

I read it while moving and wow. I simply had to sit down and continue reading no matter what I was doing. There were no if, buts, maybes about it. I had to read this book. It was a book that forced me to recognise both the privilege and prejudice in my own life. I\u2019m white and my family really isn\u2019t well off, but I have been given many opportunities throughout my life that needs to be recognised.Living in Australia it is pretty much common knowledge that our country is racist. It may not be to the extreme of America due to our strict gun laws but there is a lot of hatred towards the indigenous and others who come to this country and aren\u2019t white. Which is ridiculous.Books like Dear Martin are eye-opening for someone like me who lives on the other side of the world. I obviously know the hate crimes that go on throughout America, they usually play on our news too. I also have studied Martin Luther King and Malcolm X in high school, with an amazing teacher, so I am not completely unaware. However, knowing about these events and hearing about the experiences are so very different.I would place Dear Martin as a book that deserves as much praise as The Hate U Give. It is truly spectacular. I\u2019m sure there will be some reviews that talk about how the world isn\u2019t like this and police officers don\u2019t do things that are written in this book but I don\u2019t think people realise that police officers are just people and wow some are really fucked up. I mean, police officers can fuck up real bad. Some are terrible people. They kidnap, rape, be cannibals and are able to get away with it because they\u2019re on the case. Why is it so hard to believe that a police officer could be a racist?I think I really took advantage of the name of that section being called ramble so it\u2019s probably time to move on. But, to summarise, this book is truly eye-opening. It doesn\u2019t beat around the bush and it captures the true feelings of so many individuals.P L O TI didn\u2019t have much of an idea of what the plot would be when I started reading Dear Martin. I didn\u2019t read the blurb. I just saw people talking about it on Twitter and it was the best way to jump into it for me. However, I did think the main characters name was Martin for a solid three chapters that really messed up my brain. I quickly rectified this, obviously.However, the story of Dear Martin follows teenage boy Justyce as he sees the world in a new way after being arrested for trying to help his ex-girlfriend get home safely. His mind is suddenly opened to a world of possibilities as he realises the racism many of his fellow peers have. His story only gets harder as the book continues and I had to stop reading a few times to really absorb what was happening throughout the book.I particularly liked the addition of the story where Justyce writes letters to Martin Luther King. He takes on a mentality of trying to do what Martin would do in his situation. How would he deal with the trials and tribulations of a teen facing racism in a modern day era? I found the letters Justyce wrote to Martin really added another heart-wrenching element to the book. As well as all the amazing characters, even the parents were awesome in this book.At some stages I got a tad lost on what was happening since the writing style was a tad jerky in some ways. It would jump time frames quite quickly and since I was quite busy the day I read Dear Martin I had to go back and re-read sections.Oh also, I should briefly mention the romance, I liked it. Something that\u2019s shocking considering how many books I\u2019ve read recently where the romance has been a drag for me. However, SJ and Justyce really worked well together for me.C H A R A C T E R S#J U S T Y C EJustyce was a character I instantly liked. That is pretty rare for me, especially with a male lead. However, his voice throughout the novel was completely identifiable and continuously interesting. It also didn\u2019t read as a woman attempting to write a male as well.I both enjoyed and hated seeing Justyce grow throughout this novel. I loved it because it 1. Showed the complexity of the authors writing and 2. Really drew you into the novel. I hated it because of why he had to grow. The poor guy couldn\u2019t catch a break no matter what he did. Just when it seemed like life would be a bit easier for him it only amplified his struggles.I was glad throughout this novel Justyce had a good network of both friends and family members that were ready to support him. In many novels, we don\u2019t even get hints of that, but I really feel like it was important to Dear Martin to show unity.O V E R A L LOverall, put Dear Martin on your TBR\u2019s and make sure you read it before the year is up. This book equally deserves the amount of success that The Hate U Give received."}, {"userName": "Malia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia", "userReview": "A really moving, well-written and thought-provoking story, which delves into subjects such as race, violence, culture, identity and relationships.

The book was both disturbing and moving and though I thought Angie Thomas' The Hate U Give was very good, I think I liked this book, dealing with a similar situation, even better.

Ich kann versichern, dass \"Dear Martin\" von Nic Stone zur zweiten Sorte geh\u00f6rt, da es so eine Geschichte ist, die die eigene Sichtweise und den Horizont ver\u00e4ndert und wirklich in einem etwas ausl\u00f6st.Nic Stone hat ein Jugendbuch verfasst, dass neben den \u00fcblichen Problemen eines Teenagers noch so viel mehr behndelt. Dieser Roman behandelt soziale und politische Themen, die das Denken ver\u00e4ndert, sich mit Tabus besch\u00e4ftigt, die sonst nur totgeschwiegen werden und ist mit seinem Rassismus und der Polizeigewalt in Amerika hochaktuell. Auf gerade mal knapp 250 Seiten, verf\u00fcgt dieses Buch so viel Tiefgang und Ehrlichkeit, dass es mich oft ersch\u00fctterte. Gerade weil diese Kontroverse gerade in aller Munde ist, finde ich, dass gerade Jugendliche sich mehr damit auseinander setzen sollten.Denn in der Geschichte, die der Protagonist Justyce erlebt, wird nichts versch\u00f6nigt und das ist auch das Gute daran. \"Dear Martin\" \u00f6ffnet einem die Augen und zeigt, dass das 21. Jahrhundert noch viele Schwachstellen in der Gesellschaft aufweist. Besonders toll fande ich, dass die Autorin mehrere Erz\u00e4hlstile gew\u00e4hlt hat, um dem Leser auf m\u00f6glichst vielf\u00e4ltige Weise die Handlung n\u00e4her zu bringen. Man findet zum Beispiel Briefe und Zeitungsartikel, aber auch Kapitel vor, die aus reinen Dialogen bestehen.Das Schicksal von Justyce hat mir das Herz gebrochen, denn obwohl er nicht der ausgeschm\u00fcckteste Protagonist war, habe ich seinen Schmerz wortw\u00f6rtlich gesp\u00fcrt. Genauso wie er habe ich mir die Frage gestellt, warum manche Menschen diese Themen noch immer einfach so mit der Hand weg wedeln, als w\u00e4ren es l\u00e4stige Fliegen. Wir d\u00fcrfen die Augen nicht verschlie\u00dfen, wir m\u00fcssen den Mund auf machen, denn egal wie man aussieht, welcher ethnischen Herkunft und Religion man angeh\u00f6rt, welches Geschlecht man hat und wenn man liebt, man sollte sich immer f\u00fcr seine Rechte und seine Mitmenschen einsetzen und gegen die Ungerechtigkeit k\u00e4mpfen. Lasst euch eure Freiheit und euer Gl\u00fcck auf keinen Fall von irgendwem wegnehmen!Fazit: JEDER sollte dieses Buch gelesen haben, denn bei mir hat es dazu beigetragen, meinen Horizont zu erweitern und wahrscheinlich wird es noch vielen anderen Menschen die Augen \u00fcber die schreckliche Realit\u00e4t unserer Gesellschaft \u00f6ffnen. Die Themen, die in \"Dear Martin\" beahndelt werden exitieren wirklich, es gibt sie, diese schrecklichen Dinge, die \u00fcberall auf der Welt passieren und sollten weder totgeschwiegen werden, noch sollten wir unsere Augen davor verschlie\u00dfen, nur weil es uns eben nicht betrifft."}, {"userName": "Aila", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25674512-aila", "userReview": "4.5 stars, rounded up because that ending was so full of hope and change that I teared (not for the first time while reading)Quick points before posting review:- From the very first chapter, I knew I would love reading from Justyce's point of view. It's a third person limited POV and we see him taking care of his ex-girlfriend who is drunk, despite breaking up recently. I knew from then Jus- debate team captain, scored almost perfect on the SAT+ACT, Yale-bound, boy after my own heart - was a caring and charming and real character. But when that incident leaves him in handcuffs and an officer falsely charging him of car-jacking, he becomes shaken.Justyce's voice is extremely realistic, as his thoughts explore the intricacies of being black in a mostly-white prep school. He's direct and constantly curious, starting up the project \"Dear Martin\" where he would write letters to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr- \"What Would Martin Do?\" becomes a part of his daily mantra as he is exposed to constant racist behavior against him and his friends. - I love how Stone explored the relationships in this book, not only from the racist remarks from white to black people, but also black to white. Jus's friend Manny is black but has grown up in privilege, surrounded by white guys who carry racist undertones in their conversation. And yet, each of them are up for \"equality\"- the equality that only makes sense with their privileged eyes. They don't \"see race,\" an argument we hear all too often despite how much it doesn't make sense. Jus also juggled a burgeoning relationship with his white debate partner - whom his mom would not have approved of - and a mysterious connection to a black gang in the neighborhood. All the while, he balance the thought of not belonging anywhere he goes, as the people at his preppy school will always have veiled racist remarks while the guys in the streets see him as too smart to hang out with them. Is there really a way of winning?- For a book that barely makes 200 pages, it packs a punch. The ending is conclusive and satisfying and almost bittersweet in a way- but that just goes to show how realistic it is. And despite that, there is a glimpse of hope and change. Readers will see a reflection of Jus's experience with what happens in reality. - One thing I would have wanted is more of an exploration with Jus's relationship with his mom and the black gang that takes matters in their own hand in the latter part of the book. There are some elements to those relationships that I feel like, if he applied to his Dear Martin project, would have come out with more learning experiences. - The dialogue was quick and natural and flowed superbly. Each characterization felt like the author took someone in the real world and inserted their character in the book- they were all so down-to-earth and extremely reflective of the attitudes people have today."}, {"userName": "jv poore", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5157918-jv-poore", "userReview": "Sometimes I stumble onto a story that renders me speechless for days, but then can be summed up in one emphatic word,\"YES!\" Taking this to \"my\" students next week and I cannot wait!"}, {"userName": "Sheena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8022062-sheena", "userReview": "Couldn\u2019t sleep till I finished this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d"}, {"userName": "Madalyn (Novel Ink)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10973677-madalyn-novel-ink", "userReview": "This review originally appeared on Novel Ink.I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.I\u2019ll begin my review of Dear Martin by stating the obvious: this is a vastly important book. It focuses on the experiences of a black teenage boy in America, a demographic that is so often demonized in the media and in society. It\u2019s a raw, honest portrayal of the main character, Justyce, grappling with the fact that he has to deal with everything from microagressions from his white classmates, to overt racial profiling by police officers, every single day. This book is by no means an easy read, but it\u2019s a necessary one.One of my favorite things about Dear Martin is the writing style. The story is told from the POV of an omniscient third-person narrator, with Justyce\u2019s first-person letters to Martin Luther King, Jr. interspersed in between. The whole thing feels conversational and just very\u2026 approachable, if that makes sense? It felt like the way actual teenagers think and speak, which was so refreshing. The writing also makes this short novel impossible to put down. I\u2019ve now read this book twice, and both times I devoured its words in a single sitting. It\u2019s a bit of a quieter, more reflective contemporary, but it draws you in nonetheless. Also, just because it\u2019s conversational does NOT mean this book is simple. It\u2019s full of nuance and explores complex topics like intersectionality, racism, and inequality in a thoughtful way.Another reason this story is so engaging and powerful is that you think you\u2019re getting one story, and then, about halfway through the book, Nic Stone punches you right in your feelings and sends the reader (and Justyce) on a completely different, but related, journey. I won\u2019t say much here because of spoilers, but man, the hits just kept on coming with this story, and unfortunately, that\u2019s all too accurate of a portrayal of the things people of color have to deal with in real life.Also, all of the relationships in Dear Martin are portrayed so thoughtfully. Every friendship, familial relationship, romantic relationship, even student-teacher relationship, felt so spot-on. Though it\u2019s not a main focus of the story, Justyce\u2019s romance with Sarah-Jane is a wonderful addition to this book. And, of course, his friendships, particularly his with Manny, were wonderfully explored.Overall, though I\u2019m finding it hard to review, I adore this book. It made me feel everything\u2013 I cried, I laughed, I got angry. Most of all, though, it made me think. It\u2019s such a thorough, personal examination of racism and inequality and one boy\u2019s journey of grappling with that inequality. Justyce\u2019s letters to MLK, desperately trying to make sense of the injustice he sees happening to himself and his friends, were the perfect lens through which to tell this story. I know Dear Martin has been and will likely continue to be compared to YA books like The Hate U Give and All American Boys, which also address police brutality, this is a unique and necessary story in its own right. I highly encourage everyone to go pick up a copy, if you haven\u2019t already!"}, {"userName": "Sandhya Menon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51141647-sandhya-menon", "userReview": "Beautiful, powerful, and nuanced.

I have read other books (ALL AMERICAN BOYS, THE HATE U GIVE) with similar subject matter that just did it better. Yes, I read this book in a day but that was because it was only 210 pages. I struggle with trusting a YA book that's only 210 pages, cause that's short! Like THE GREAT GATSBY short and surprise, I didn't like THE GREAT GATSBY. I felt like there needed to be more. I read in the acknowledgements that Nic Stone's editor helped her cut the book in half and I wish I could have read the other half.Additionally, the format was distracting and weird. The book began with a third person narrative, which, was odd. Not the narrative but the narrator. It was clearly a female narrator speaking about a male protagonist and it was jarring and not succinct. Then it would switch to the letters Jus was writing to MLK...great, cool, I can deal with those two structures. But THEN for no reason, it would go into script format. What?! Like, why? The worst was when it would go from narrative to script within the chapter but then there was dialog in the letters and those were neither...It had no point or purpose. The constant format switches were distracting from the actual book. I appreciate those stylized choices when they have a purpose or a meaning to the story, but this just felt lazy and was distracting.Finally, the writing itself was poor and boring at many points. It was bland and non-descriptive. There were points I wanted to explore, but were, instead, glazed over. Other points felt very preachy. The characters, especially in the debate scenes, appeared to be merely mouth pieces and not actual people. That was frustrating. A lot of the characters were 2D for me, especially Sarah-Jean and Doc. The only characters that had actual development were Jus and Jared, which was great. Their development was well portrayed but it wasn't enough for me. That was disappointing.Oh! And the book didn't pass the Bechtel test which was highly annoying. Sarah-Jean felt like her own type of manic-pixie girl which pissed me off. Like, does that girl have a flaw? No? Okay, cool. And the other girl, Melo, was represented as a \"messed-up hoe\" so...yay women. I will not deny that the message in this book is powerful and should be expressed and written about. This book has a very LOOKING FOR ALASKA feel in that there is a before and an after structure to it. I'll admit, when the big shock happened, I had to close the book and try not to cry for several minutes. I was stunned. It hit me hard. I appreciate that I got a window into a world that I--as a cis gender, straight, white woman--will never experience. It was not the best portrayal of this message. When compared to some of the other books about this same topic, it falls short. I would recommend other books before this one and yeah, that makes me sad. But it mainly has to do with the formatting and the writing itself. It has nothing to do with the message or the representation of racial issues in our world today.
