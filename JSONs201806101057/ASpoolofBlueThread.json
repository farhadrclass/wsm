It just unwinds and unwinds, there are no highs or lows. When reading A Spool of Blue Thread I kept waiting for the climax, but it never came....it just unwound and unwound. Yes, there were a few minor surprises, but not enough to save this book. This is a great example of a popular author, dynamic publisher's marketing campaign and an attractive cover all working together to create a great deal of noise around a mediocre book."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "\"The trouble with dying,\" she'd told Jeannie once, \"is that you don't get to see how everything turns out. You won't know the ending.\"\nThis book was lovely. That's how I would describe it. I'm not going to sell it as anything it isn't - fans of fast-paced action and fantasy should look elsewhere - because this is a quiet, moving family drama; nothing more or less. And yet, that was more than enough to make this one of my favourite, beautifully-written character studies.Sometimes there are those rare books that capture pieces of real life in such a way that you look at the ordinary as you have never looked at it before. Very few authors can successfully turn the mundane into art. There are those who try to mimic the successful few but they almost always fail. Anne Tyler is apparently one of those authors who can take such a simplistic story of family life and breathe so much humanity into her characters that the everyday becomes compelling.This is a book about the Whitshank family - several generations of it. I lost the exact quote but I recall one point when a character is described as being \"like most people - insufferable but likable\". And that is how most characters are in this book. We are dragged into their lives, forced to care about them, and yet they are complex, annoying, difficult, selfish and lovable. Tyler takes just pages - perhaps even just paragraphs - to weave dialogue into a dynamic we can understand. From the beginning, we recognise Abby for the caring and smothering mother she is and we see Red as the more critical and skeptical of the two. Then as their children are introduced into the story, we see that Denny is intelligent, selfish, rebellious and constantly running from his own life. We see the overbearing and strong Amanda taking charge of most situations, the kindly Stem who always puts others first, and Jeannie - a personality often forgotten in the chaos of family drama.As Abby and Red get older, Abby experiences some mental blackouts and Red's hearing gradually declines, so their sons and daughters must come together and decide how to help their aging parents (who adamantly do not want help). The relationships, the rivalries and the love all intertwine in this story that combines insights into the Whitshank family history and their modern lives.Books such as this one are often called \"slow\", but I didn't find it slow at all. I think if you pick this book up knowing what to expect and are ready to read a story about people and family, then you should be swept along by these fascinating characters. I, for one, read it in a single day.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "Some time back, I learned this: you don\u2019t just open a book by Anne Tyler, you enter it. You get introduced to the characters, take up residence with them in their Baltimore neighborhoods, watch them muddle through their challenges and triumphs, and inevitably, feel as if you\u2019re saying a fond farewell to family members when you close the last page.That\u2019s the beauty of Anne Tyler\u2019s writing. Her characters are quirky, eccentric, and so achingly real that they could step off the page and seamlessly walk right into your home. Virtually every one of her novels offers a heartbreakingly hilarious and often poignant look at f everyday families: marital secrets, sibling jealousies, skeletons in the closet, unexpected loss, and love unearthed in the strangest ways and in the strangest places.A Spool of Blue Thread weaves its way into the tapestry of Anne Tyler\u2019s works and offers its own charms. Like its predecessors, it takes place in Baltimore and focuses on a family \u2013 in this case, the Whitshanks. As the book traverses back and forth through time, we meet Linnie and Junior, their son Red, his wife Abby and their four children\u2026and their children. The lovingly hand-crafted house where they reside becomes its own character, paying witness to four generations until \u201cthe filmy-skinned ghosts frolicked and danced on the porch with nobody left to watch.\u201d These fully-realized characters reveal themselves to us \u2013 the readers \u2013 as the narrative slowly surrenders its secrets. Anne Tyler\u2019s characters are distinctly themselves but they could be anyone: they may say the wrong thing or take the wrong path and their lives are often messy, yet at their core, they are good people who are just trying to forge their way through.And oh, how Ms. Tyler makes her insights seem so effortless. Here\u2019s one character\u2019s reaction to another\u2019s forgiveness: \u201cThe sudden, alerted sweep of her eyes across his face had made him feel the way a parched plant must feel when it\u2019s finally given water.\u201d Or this: \u201cMaybe when he was grown, she remembered thinking during his childhood, he would finally tell her what used to make him so angry. But then when he was grown she had asked him and he had said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, to be honest.\u201d It all rings so true.I\u2019ve said little about the plot and that\u2019s deliberate: it\u2019s up to every reader to discover all the nuances of this family and what drives them forward. Anne Tyler has said this will be her last book and all I can say is, \u201cSay it\u2019s not so.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "The characters in \u201cA Spool of Blue Thread\u201d look like the same Baltimore family members we\u2019ve socialized with for 50 years in Anne Tyler\u2019s fiction. In fact, everything about her new novel \u2014 from its needlepointed title to its arthritic plot \u2014 sounds worn-out.So how can it be so wonderful? The funky meals, the wacky professions, the distracted mothers and the lost children \u2014 they\u2019re all here. But complaining that Tyler\u2019s novels are redundant is like whining that Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets are always 14 lines long. Somehow, what\u2019s familiar seems transcended in these pages, infused with freshness and surprise \u2014 evidence, once again, that Tyler remains among the best chroniclers of family life this country has ever produced.\u201cThere was nothing remarkable about the Whitshanks,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut like most families, they imagined they were special. . . . They made a little too much of the family quirks.\u201d We might, of course, mutter the same comment about Tyler, who\u2019s been making a little too much of the family quirks since 1964. But for generations, readers have caught echoes of their own parents and siblings in her eccentric characters. The tightly wound humor and tragedy of her stories, delivered in prose that never draws attention to its graceful wit, demonstrate that every unremarkable family, wrapped in proud insularity, is special.\u201cA Spool of Blue Thread\u201d introduces us to Red and Abby Whitshank, the parents of three successful, happily married children who have dutifully remained in their parents\u2019 orbit. But it\u2019s Denny, their fourth child, the best-looking one, who absorbs the bulk of their concern. A difficult teen, he found Abby intolerably embarrassing and everyone else boring. He got a girl pregnant, then later announced he was gay \u2014 no, scratch that: not gay. Over the years he\u2019s shocked his parents with his dissipated life and especially with his apparent disregard for them. \u201cWhat other middle-class American teenager lived the way he did,\u201d Red and Abby think, \u201cflitting around the country like a vagrant, completely out of his parents\u2019 control, getting in touch just sporadically and neglecting whenever possible to give them any means of getting in touch with him?\u201d Their \u201cmystery child\u201d is a chef, then a software engineer; he\u2019s married, then he\u2019s separated \u2014 who knows?Tyler\u2019s sentiments are perfectly calibrated to trace the desperation of these parents, pinging between annoyance and concern. For years, Denny has practiced a kind of passive blackmail, withholding himself for so long and so completely that when he graces the family at random moments, they\u2019re deferential and gentle, cowed by his silences. During one pleasant visit, Red makes the mistake of asking, \u201cDo you have a job?\u201d and Denny vanished for three years. Is there a family who doesn\u2019t suffer such a member, a loved one who makes you ashamed of how much you miss him and how little he needs you? Tyler knows exactly how affection weakens even our most determined resentment. She knows what mysteries we are to each other.The plot revolves around another common family crisis: At 72, Abby begins experiencing episodes \u2014 erratic moments of distraction during which she sometimes wanders away from the house. And then Red has a mild heart attack. Their children rally. The youngest son moves into the house with his wife and three boys. But then \u2014 surprise \u2014 Denny arrives and announces that he\u2019ll take care of everything. It\u2019s an offer that sounds entirely sincere and completely unreliable.Suddenly, the Whitshank house \u2014 too empty for so long \u2014 is too full, bursting with children and spouses and grandchildren, a cacophonous orchestra of emotional needs, buried resentments and conflicting best intentions, not to mention disagreements about how dinner should be cooked. (No one sets a better fictional table than Tyler, and there\u2019s a classic meal in this novel.)It\u2019s a large group, but she conducts these characters so nimbly that they never dissolve in the noise. An extended scene on a leisurely Sunday afternoon in the back yard is some of the most lovely and loving writing Tyler has ever done. And when you consider what music she can play with this apparently static, muted material, \u201cThe Spool of Blue Thread\u201d seems like an act of literary enchantment.Yet we also get a clear sense of the strains building even as Abby and Red enjoy hugging their family under one roof again. And that\u2019s not just any roof. Tyler understands the way people can feel rooted to property. The Whitshanks are \u201cone of those enviable families that radiate clannishness and togetherness,\u201d but much of that group identity is invested in their carefully maintained house. Red\u2019s father built it, clung to it and passed it along to Red as a varnished emblem of the family\u2019s social and financial success.Indeed, what gives \u201cA Spool of Blue Thread\u201d such unexpected weight is its delineation of the provenance of this family home. Late in the novel, the narrative suddenly slips back to show Abby and Red before they were married, and then it fades back further still to tell the tragicomic story of Red\u2019s mismatched parents. Among the several delights of this book is how effectively Tyler captures these earlier eras. She conveys their antique ideals about sex and marriage and what it means to be a success at a time when poverty sent people careening out into the world with nothing. The Whitshanks will eventually paper over their petty origins and construct a mythos as pleasant and solid as their home, but in the telescope of Tyler\u2019s narrative, we can see the interplay of accident and willfulness, love and envy that created these complicated people who pretend they have no secrets.From a different author, this domestic muckraking would be disillusioning and satiric, a searing exposure of a happy family\u2019s corrupt origins. But Tyler never mocks her characters. Even when she\u2019s having fun with their weird peculiarities and transparent short-sightedness, she\u2019s usually a benevolent goddess. And yet it\u2019s her surprising brutality that kills off any germs of sentimentality in her work. Her sorrow is never unbearable \u2014 but it\u2019s never absent, either.This review first appeared in The Washington Post:http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta..."}, {"userName": "Abby Huff", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5433997-abby-huff", "userReview": "I will be honest and say I did not finish this book.

I own 6 -not yet read paperback books ( thrift book specials or freebies ), by Ann Tyler, yet \"A Spool of Blue Thread\" is my very first novel I've read by this wonderful woman. I fell in love in Ann Tyler in a more indirect way than most of her fans. Being a late bloomer reader, myself, somehow, I missed her books. ( not intentionally). But...this is the way I first 'melted' for Ann.It was 3 years ago...2013: The San Jose Mercury newspaper ran a HUGE 2 full-length spread interview on Ann Tyler. I learned that Ann had never before - in 50 years allowed herself to be interviewed she explained 'why now' . I was moved!! Her new book, \"The Beginner's Goodbye\", was just being released. From that one 'amazing' article I fell in love with this woman ( author or not), I 'felt' her truth, her exquisite beauty, ( she glows from being real....inside and out), she tapped into my ownwisdom, expanded my perception, and is a woman who listens for understanding....and chooses love. That article was invaluable ...leaving a lasting impression! My review for \"A Spool of Blue Thread\"...... is going to be the shortest review I've written in a long time.

In this novel we are introduced to the Whitshanks, mother Abby and father Red with their four grown children, at least grown at the beginning of the novel. Like most families, they do not always get along, they have secrets from each other and one doesn't quite want to fit into the family mold.Delightful, amusing, poignant and so darn realistic. The novel starts in the present, goes back to the past when the children were younger and then even further back to Red's parents. See there is a house and this house has a special place in all their lives. Built by Red's father for someone else it became his in a questionable way.Funny how many of the stories told within a family and passed down may often not be the whole truth. This novel reveals some of the inconsistencies in this family's stories. And Linnie May, she sure is some piece of work, funny how appearances are so often deceiving. That is the brilliance of Anne Tyler, she knows all these things about people and more importantly she knows how to write about them, making what many of us can identify in our own lives and families, oh so interesting.If this is in fact her last novel, I for one will surely miss her wonderful stories.ARc from publisher."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "Anne Tyler's latest novel is another thoughtful story about marriage and family, and I cherished it.A Spool of Blue Thread is about the Whitshank family of Baltimore. The novel covers several generations and different family perspectives, but the heart of the book was with the mother, Abby Whitshank. Abby loves and frets over her children and grandchildren, and she frequently invites strangers over to dinner if she feels they need someplace to go. But Abby is getting forgetful as she gets older, and sometimes gets lost going on walks. Her husband, Red, is going deaf, and some family members think the parents shouldn't be left alone.I liked how the story unfolded \u2014 it opened in 1994 with a strange phone call from one of the children, and then progresses through the years, skipping ahead when necessary and showing different points of view. Halfway through the book, it jumps back in time and shows Abby as a young woman, on the day she fell in love with Red. We also meet Red's parents, and learn how they get together.This is a lovely, poignant story, and it reminded me why I like Anne Tyler books so much. (My favorites are Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and The Accidental Tourist.) She is skilled at bringing characters to life through the smallest of details, and each person reminds me of someone I know.

It's not that it is badly written, because it isn't, and I had no problem with the delivery...it just didn't grab me...I kept reading on thinking it will pick up soon, something will happen, but it never really did. Or, when it did, it didn't have any of the emotive elements one would expect to be captivated by.For the most part I found it only vaguely interesting, a bit like casual eavesdropping on an ordinary family get together...not uninteresting but not compelling either, as there were no really stand out moments in those lives that made the story riveting or exciting in any way.For me, the only real bit of pick up came at around the last 25% mark, where it started to get a bit more interesting and slightly eventful, which helped my determination to see it through to the end.So although I didn't dislike this book, it didn't do anything for me, and I was left thinking I could have sat on a train for a few hours tuning into the conversations around me for the same effect....or I could have read a different book, and maybe that's the thing, it's possible that it just wasn't for me."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "There is nothing about this book I did not like.Three generations of the Witshank family is introduced by the author in a low-key, no-frills-no-fuzz manner. They were not outstanding; they did not change the world; but they were the epicenter of what it means to be American.The story is not linear, and the surprise, or rather mystery, of the family's origin, is delivered in the last part of the book. The narrative is character-driven. What I take away is that we can all forgive ourselves for being ordinary and yet, and yet, have a story to tell that will not rock this world, but will at least explain what it means to be human in our lifetime and feeling totally okay with it. Each character was important enough to make a difference in how the family dynamic manifest itself in the collective history of time.The author has a convincing, relaxing way of dealing with the plot and characters, engaging the reader word-for-word until the very end.

We all have them don\u2019t we, that dish we turn to when feeling blue or just wanting to revel in hearth and home. For me that dish has always been beefaroni, not the Chef Boyardee shit, but real homemade beefaroni. Follow up a big dish of that, with warm Dutch apple pie and vanilla ice cream, paired with a glass of the good stuff, slippers on my tootsies and a good book and colour me content and life good.Reading A Spool of Blue Thread brought these images to mind readily. It is a story about family, four generations of Whitshank\u2019s and their Baltimore home with its grand and sprawling, full-length front porch. As we enter this story it is a late July evening and Red and Abby who occupy the house on Bouton Road are preparing to turn in for the evening when they receive a phone call from their son Denny. Denny is the best looking of Red and Abby\u2019s four children and the one that has caused Abby the greatest amount of worry. Which was not to say that Denny was bad. He was far more generous, for instance, than the other three put together. (He traded his new bike for a kitten when Jeannie\u2019s beloved cat died.) And he didn\u2019t bully other children, or throw tantrums. But he was so close-mouthed. He had these spells of unexplained obstinacy, where his face would grow set and pinched and no one could get through to him. It seemed to be a kind of inward tantrum; it seemed his anger turned in upon itself and hardened him or froze him. Red threw up his hands when that happened and stomped off, but Abby couldn\u2019t let him be. She just had to jostle him out of it. She wanted her loved ones happy!This was such an absorbing read; one might think I was reading about my own family. Every day life, every day moments, spanning three generations of the Whitshank family. As Zoeytron says in her spot on review, \"It\u2019s a quiet tale, well told.\u201d There is no grand plot, no nail biting suspense, just a heart warming story of one family that could just as easily be your own. I was completely drawn in, compulsively reading, so in tune it seemed with everyone\u2019s thoughts and feelings and oh so reluctant for the book to end.

I almost didn\u2019t read it, not for any particular reason other than it just didn\u2019t sound that interesting to me. But I\u2019d heard alright reviews and after it being longlisted for the Man Booker prize this year I decided to give it a try. And wow, what a fantastic reading experience!I went the audiobook route for this one, and it was definitely worth it. It\u2019s about 13 hours long, but it just breezed by. Kimberly Farr narrates and does a fantastic job at it, probably the best of any audiobook narrator I\u2019ve ever listened to (granted I\u2019m not incredibly well-versed in the audiobook world, but nonetheless she was phenomenal). She takes on each character with such a distinct tone and with great inflection, but it\u2019s not gimmicky or ridiculous voice acting. It still seems really natural while maintaining the distinction among characters.Conceptually, the story is very interesting. It\u2019s sort of told in a backwards manner; starting in 1994 and working it\u2019s way into the 2000\u2019s, but then jumping back in time twice after that. Overall it traces three generations of the Whitshank family and their beautiful, big old house in Baltimore. The house itself is really a character all its own.I was completely hooked within the first chapter, and the second and third chapters broke my heart and put it all back together again. Then the mid-section was a tad bit lackluster, but because Anne Tyler writes the characters in such a dynamic way, their average American lives took on a sort of cinematic drama. It felt like I was watching a play by a 20th century American play right, a sort of Edward Albee/Tennessee Williams vibe.

This is the feeling I get when reading an Anne Tyler novel. Coming home would be the operative phrase.

This just touched my heart in so many ways. \n\"And time... Well you know about time. How slow it is when you're little and how it speeds up faster and faster once you're grown. Well now it's just a blur. I can't keep track of it anymore! But it's like time is sort of balanced. We're young for such a small fraction of our lives, and yet our youth seems to stretch on forever. Then we're old for years and years, but time flies by fastest then. So it all comes out equal in the end don't you see.\"\nA Spool of Blue Thread is a a richly woven tapestry of family life with the focus falling at different times on all the generations: grandparents, parents, children. But somehow the most important character in the book is the house in which they all live. The house that sees youth through to old age, that sees a family's good days and their bad, their highs and their lows, and knows all their hidden secrets... A house bursting at the seems with stories and memories.This is a book that I think we can all identify with in some way. Most of us are lucky enough to have some form of family or support system in our life. And for the majority we have at least one of the following: parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles etc... These people that we spend our entire lives with. They are the the ones that are there for every occasion. They know us intimately and yet sometimes seem to not know or understand us at all. They can frustrate you the most, drive you absolutely scatty, and they are the ones that can hurt you more than anyone else ever could....yet they are the ones that we hold most dear. Without them life would be a pale imitation of itself. That's why we call them our loved ones. This is a book about one such family called the Whitshanks who are each other's loved ones. They're just as normal as any one can be, but just as crazy too! I found the story to be thoroughly engaging. I loved the layout; the way the story of the family moving backwards in time was slowly unfurled to the reader. I loved seeing the relationships of all the different people within the family; the ever changing yet strangely also somehow ever constant family dynamics! I definitely played a bit of 'spot your own family member' among all the characters. Definitely a book that I would recommend if you want to escape from your own life and get lost in someone else's family drama for a change! This was just a lovely and very satisfying read. A story that held my attention from start through to the finish and one that made me weep a little at the end because of the simple beauty of what family truly means. four and a half stars\n\"Abby had a little trick that she used any time Red acted like a cranky old codger. She reminded herself of the day she had fallen in love with him. 'It was a beautiful, breezy, yellow-and-green afternoon' she'd begin, and it would all come back to her - the newness of it, the whole world magically opening before her at the moment when she first realised that this person that she'd barely noticed all these years was, in fact, a treasure. He was perfect, was how she'd put it to herself. And then the clear-eyed, calm-faced boy would shine forth from Red's sags and wrinkles, from his crumpled eyelids and hollowed cheeks and the two deep crevices bracketing his mouth and just his general obtuseness, his stubbornness, his infuriating belief that simple cold logic could solve all of life's problems, and she would feel unspeakably lucky to have ended up with him.\""}, {"userName": "Helle", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6909470-helle", "userReview": "[The one direct reference to it toward the end felt a bit unsatisfactory to me, to everyone in my book club.

In my opinion, there are few authors who can consistently weave compelling, moving stories about both the seemingly mundane and the more dramatic moments families experience.Apparently Tyler has said that \nA Spool of Blue Thread\n, her 20th novel, will be her last. I tried not to let that fact influence my expectations or color my perceptions of the book.Abby Whitshank has known her husband Red for as long as she can remember. They grew up in the same Baltimore suburb, and she can even remember the summer day in 1959 that she fell in love with him. Through the years the couple has lived in the stately old house his father built (a house that at times meant more to him than his entire family), raising four children and having their share of wonderful memories as well as arguments, frustrations, sadness, and struggles.\"The disappointments seemed to escape the family's notice, though. That was another of their quirks: they had a talent for pretending that everything was fine.\"Although their relationship has grown a bit more cantankerous as they have aged, and following Abby's retirement from social work, both she and Red know they would be lost without each other. But after a series of health problems affect the two of them, their younger son Stem (aka Douglas), his wife, and his family move back into the house with Red and Abby, ostensibly to help take care of them, which doesn't sit too well with either of them. It also doesn't please their older son Denny, the one child who has caused the most friction in their lives. Denny, too, moves in to help.\nA Spool of Blue Thread\n is the story of the joys, angst, and frustrations that are a part of family dynamics. It's a look at the secrets we keep, the lies we tell, what we say and what we don't, and how there are always people in your family you don't always understand. It's also a bit of a multi-generational love story, as the book not only looks at Abby and Red's relationship both at the start and in the present, but also looks at the relationship of Red's parents, Junior and Linnie Mae.I have always loved Tyler's writing, and her use of language and storytelling is in fine form once again. Her characters are quirky and a little eccentric, but they have a lot of heart, and you really get drawn into their lives. I enjoyed this book a great deal, although it took a while for me to warm up to the section about Junior and Linnie Mae, because I felt that Junior was a fairly unlikeable character, although Tyler gradually unveiled his depth.I wouldn't necessarily count this among Tyler's best, but it's another example of why she is one of the most enduring and celebrated writers of our time. I hope that she changes her mind and shares her talents with the world again, but if not, we have 20 wonderful novels to enjoy again and again. And for that I am truly grateful.

He started a construction company in the 1930s, built his dream home with a wide front porch, but never quite fit in with his affluent neighbors who had more privileged backgrounds. The Baltimore home almost becomes another character in the story.His son, Red Whitshank, married Abby and raised four children.

I found myself as keen to get back to reading it as I ever am with a fast paced action thriller! I must also add that I was delighted right at the end to find out what the title meant.

This is my first experience reading Anne Tyler--which somehow seems unbelievable (though I remember enjoying the film of Accidental Tourist)--and I enjoyed it a lot.Every family is it's own self, has its own identity, and that is certainly true of the Whitshanks. They seem almost a mirror--how do they compare to other families? Are they \"every\" family, as they initially appear and describe themselves? Or are they a more eccentric brand of normal like you and I (if you don't object to the comparison)--only perhaps more so? And once we learn more about the earlier generation!--Well claims to \"every\" family seem more feeble.But that seems part of the point for me. Many families have odd ball members, lone wolves like Denny. The question is--how was he formed. Many have artsy, interfering mothers like Abby or single-minded fathers like Red. But the level of secrets between and among generations are what make the dynamics of this family and story so interesting for me. And Tyler writes it so well. She kept my attention.Tyler creates moments from life so spectacularly spot-on. There is an old saying that nothing brings out family issues like weddings and funerals. The way she deals with these is very well done--particularly the funeral. I recognized some of those moments from my own experience. Of course I'm left with questions at the end--not a bad thing in any novel. It indicates the author caught me in her net. Would Denny have been different if he knew less, I wonder? And who was the true Linnie?Oh well I'll never know but I can muse. I'm very glad I made the acquaintance of the Whitshank family and Anne Tyler.

An online group discussion of it next month prompted my doing so now, and I'm glad I did. As if in a pleasurable breeze, the pages flew by, especially during Part One, which is actually the majority of the book. At points I felt like I was reading about my own family, even to the extent that we've recently gone through and are going through some of the same events. I found Abby and Red's daughters not as delineated as their sons, but the two young women do marry men with the same first name, so perhaps that's intentional.Nearing the end of the aforementioned Part One, Rohinton Mistry's Family Matters popped into my head. I wondered if an Indian reader might find some of the same things in this American novel that I did while reading his so-called 'domestic drama' also set in a particular evolving city.While Part Two clears up some family mysteries for the reader (I'm not sure these qualify as secrets), I'm also not sure it added any great understanding to the family back in the future. Even without those details, I think we'd arrived at much understanding already, though I especially liked the nuanced portrait of Linnie Mae that is not at all available to the younger generation.As far as the title goes, I spotted a throwaway reference to it near the end of the first part, so for the rest of the book, even into the short Part Three, I kept an eye out for its reappearance. It reappears 'off-camera', which was a little bit of a disappointment, as I would've preferred it to be shown to us in the same manner Abby's painted pottery house is."}, {"userName": "Zia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2118429-zia", "userReview": "I didn't know this at the time of reading, but apparently this is Anne Tyler's last novel.I think she struggled with this book.

You laugh with people not at them. There are all sorts of humor, so I had to clarify.************************************ I loved the humor of the first section, and it is this section that makes up the largest portion of the whole book. I laughed and laughed and laughed. You should read the book, just for this. The book unrolls backwards in time, starting in 2012, when Abby and Red Whitshank are in their 70s with adult kids and grandchildren. As with most of Tyler\u2019s book they live in Baltimore. At the end it flips back again to 2012. Coping with elderly parents, that is the central theme of the book. Also, and as usual, Tyler looks at a dysfunctional family. But aren\u2019t we all dysfunctional families, on and off at least?! If you have elderly parents, you will recognize the \"problems\" that arise, and you will laugh. Illness and memory loss and all the help that elderly parents need! Who should do what? Is there one who never helps, who always manages to abscond? There will always be one who shirks responsibility. I don't believe you can find any family where kids don't at some time bicker about one sibling getting preferential treatment! And\u2026.what do you do with the family home and all the stuff in it? I guarantee you will chuckle. I guarantee you will recall similar situations in your own family. The dialogs will make you laugh!After the first section, the book goes backwards in time; the reader learns of Red and Abby's parents, and also how Abby and Red first met. This part of the story isn't as amusing, and there is no advantage in hopping backward. Dates are made confusing. It is always important to know the date. Is it the Depression? How is the economy? To understand the people's lives you need to know what is happening in their world. A chronological telling would have been clearer. The story could have been tightened.This book is all about character portrayal. At the book's close you will know the parents and grandparents and grandchildren. You will know each one well, and each individual is different. There are many characters and practically all feel true to life. There is the black sheep of the family, the softy, the efficient breadwinner too. They are not stereotyped; in all families sibling simply are different!The audiobook is narrated by Kimberly Farr. She does a fabulous job. She uses different intonations for different characters. I did have trouble when the story switched to Abby and Red's parents. I kept thinking of Abby and Red, forgetting that the story had switched to their parents. I could not hear the difference. Kind of confusing, at least for me.I recommend grabbing this book and reading it, particularly if you have elderly parents. I promise - you will understand and you will laugh. I like it when authors make us laugh at ourselves and our struggles to get through the difficult times in our lives."}, {"userName": "\u00b7Karen\u00b7", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen", "userReview": "This exceeded my expectations, but probably only because those expectations were fairly subterranean. My sole previous brush with Tyler was Back When We Were Grownups in an edition with that generic back-of-a-woman's-head cover picture that suggests to me that even the publishers didn't know how to give it spice, certainly nothing remains of it except a chaotic family picnic. Bland fodder. White bread sandwich with slick lettuce and tomato. This was richer, but it's still terribly cosy. A bit like your kindly maiden aunt taking you out for tea at Jenner's. It gave me a break from myself (and I needed it) in Baltimore with the Whitshank family, a convenient wee outing and greatly appreciated, thank you kindly. No doubt about it that it's all very competently written. A straightforward family story, with a few quirky muddles. And a couple of dogs. A beach holiday on an uncrowded stretch of the Delaware coast. An old couple, growing older. Someone dies. Things shift and settle again. Apparently this is what Tyler does.

I'll be honest, I was quite disappointed with this book. In fact, I was very close to DNF-ing it which is a major thing for me (someone who rarely DNFs books). After my book group discussion last night, I can definitely understand the appeal to most people, and Anne Tyler is an incredibly popular writer... but I'm not sure her style is really for me.This book is essentially a family saga, that jumps between three generations of the Whitshank family and those various timelines. The first half of the book deals merely with the most recent generation, and the further into the novel we go, more is revealed about the family's past. Essentially, even the most seemingly normal, mundane families have their dark secrets.I think what made me struggle with this book a little was the fact it was almost entirely dialogue. I don't mind dialogue, but I also like description, and I felt the book was severely lacking in this. It didn't help also that a great deal of the conversations that took place were quite generic. I felt like I was watching a soap opera at times, but without the intense melodrama that comes with it. What I ended up liking a lot more were the earliest narratives (chronology-wise), that focused on how the family came to live in their big beautiful house, and how the most recent children's grandparents came together. That section was the most intriguing, and the darkest I felt. I just found the rest of it felt a little tedious to me.Anne Tyler is clearly excellent at capturing the feeling of a family, and showing the subtle complexities of interpersonal relationships within families. However, I like my books with a little more darkness and a little more plot, and I just didn't think this delivered on that front. Not the book's fault, but just not my preference."}, {"userName": "Charles Finch", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8152701-charles-finch", "userReview": "My USA today review.*****By my count I've now reviewed around 50 books for USA TODAY. I've never given any of them four stars until today: to A Spool of Blue Thread, the masterful 20th novel by Anne Tyler.What makes it so good? Its subject is her most recognizable and essential one, family, its setting again Baltimore, its story told in her customarily sweet, wistful, comic voice. In other words, A Spool of Blue Thread has all the ingredients that come together to powerful effect in the author's best books, like Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, but they're also the ones that can make her lesser work feel insubstantial, slight in scope, a little wan.What distinguishes this iteration, and places it firmly within that first class, is its risky narrative layout. For a little more than half its length, the book tells the present-day story of the Whitshanks \u2013 a classic Tyler tribe, \"one of those enviable families that radiate clannishness.\" There are the aging parents, Red and Abby, the three loving children, and also of course the prodigal, Denny, who has the charisma of any ungraspable child. His return home seems initially to be the book's big story.But then, suddenly, it flies backward from the modern day. First it returns to Red and Abby in their youth, as they meet; then, going still farther back, it depicts the early Baltimore years of Red's father, a suburban Gatsby, and his obsessive construction of the beautiful house to which Denny, who never knew him, will ultimately come back.This structure gives A Spool of Blue Thread an infusion of intensity and energy, just when it threatens to flag. It turns out that historical fiction, which shows rather than describes the passage of time, is uniquely suited to render all that Tyler cares about \u2013 the meaning of family and memory, the desire for the preservation of what we love and the poignant consciousness that such preservation is impossible, the symbolism that exists as surely in daily life as it does in literature.Take the Whitshank house, for instance, which in the hands of a less subtle writer might be a clunky device. Because we see it across different eras, watching how each generation treats its lovely specificities, its chamfered edges, its double pocket doors, the house comes to feel at once real and metaphorical \u2013 as houses do in life, as families do in life.It's difficult to assess Tyler's place in American literary culture. On the one hand, it feels fair to compare her to domestic writers like Laurie Colwin and Adam Gopnik \u2013 beloved, limited. On the other hand, she's often too dark and querying for that comparison to work, more akin to the enigmatic Alice Munro, or, if you prefer, a direct influence on Jonathan Franzen, who also analyzes the painful recursions of family life.The problem is that when a writer writes the same book more than once, even if there's some slight new pressure of emphasis, it's easy to reduce their achievement to a few themes. But A Spool of Blue Thread is a flight forward \u2013 a liberation, in the way it chooses to escape the Whitshank family in order to describe them.Tyler, who's 73, has nothing left to prove. But she may still have new things to say."}], "description": "A freshly observed, joyful and wrenching, funny and true new novel from Anne Tyler\"It was a beautiful, breezy, yellow-and-green afternoon.\" This is how Abby Whitshank always begins the story of how she fell in love with Red that day in July 1959. The Whitshanks are one of those families that radiate togetherness: an indefinable, enviable kind of specialness. But they are also like all families, in that the stories they tell themselves reveal only part of the picture. Abby and Red and their four grown children have accumulated not only tender moments, laughter, and celebrations, but also jealousies, disappointments, and carefully guarded secrets. from Red's father and mother, newly-arrived in Baltimore in the 1920s, to Abby and Red's grandchildren carrying the family legacy boisterously into the twenty-first century, here are four generations of Whitshanks, their lives unfolding in and around the sprawling, lovingly worn Baltimore house that has always been their anchor.Brimming with all the insight, humour, and generosity of spirit that are the hallmarks of Anne Tyler's work, A Spool of Blue Thread tells a poignant yet unsentimental story in praise of family in all its emotional complexity.
