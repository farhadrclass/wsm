A mighty faith-elevating warrior and an advocate for families faced with disability challenges. Families with precious, beautiful children such as her own little boy - Christian. The Buchanans have been through hell and back solidifying their courage, rebuilding their lives, and strengthening their faith through their son's physical birth malformations/defect challenges. \"Sometimes God allows what He hates, to accomplish what He loves.\"Defect, is a word I loathe. To me, it creates a perception of \"less-than\" - something abnormal and to be pitied. Christian is in no way a \"less-than\" child or to be pitied, as evidenced by Lacey's YouTube videos, Facebook page, and this inspirational biography/memoir. \"Christian is fearfully and wonderfully made. I, in my sin and craziness, am fearfully and wonderfully made. And this perspective helps me during encounters with others. No matter how people act they also are fearfully and wonderfully made.\"This book touched my heart and lifted my soul in numerous ways. And that is exactly what Lacey Buchanan hoped for when writing it. \"God pours us broken into this His refining fire to mold us, and I was more than ready for Him to douse the flames.\"However, it is also a bittersweet, heart wrenching book, in that, the Buchanans have been tested by many fires: daunting medical decisions; struggles to find competent doctors willing to 'listen' and treat with compassion; insurance rejections and appeals; public negativity and cyber bullying (it is unreal how insensitive some people can be). \"When people have nothing better to do with their time, they troll the internet. they look for ways to be divisive because they're unhappy with something in their own lives that they don't understand how to deal with.\"And of course, Lacey and her family have the same struggles as any young family, but with added stressors: juggling work and school schedules; long commutes; bills-bills-bills and more bills; medical transportation needs; loads of medical equipment to pack and tote . . . The list is really endless when caring for a disabled/other-abled child. The book itself is simplistically and conversationally written and should appeal to a broad audience, whatever one's reading comprehension level. And precious are the many photos. How could anyone not love this family? However, the book isn't without a few snafus. Line editing was sub-par. The non-linear, back and forth way in which the story is told, oftentimes back-and-forth within chapters and without delineation, gave me momentary confusion, where I'd have to go back a few pages to properly pick-up the thread. Lastly, the writing is a bit grammatically challenged. Which would be okay, Lacey not being a wordsmith, if not for the fact it was co-authored by presumably a professional writer???? \"What is life but God's daring invitation to a remarkable journey?\"All in all, snafus included, Through the Eyes of Hope: Love More, Worry Less, and See God in the Midst of Your Adversity a noteworthy, recommendable book. I pray it helps others in their times of challenging, worrisome circumstances, and life-changing detours. It did for me.

Her son Christian was born with Tessier's Cleft palate, one of only a several in the world. This means that his palate was not formed and his face did not look \"normal\". He was also born with no eyes, so he is blind. Christian would have to endure several surgeries though out his young life, the first at 4 days old. Lacey tells of her and her family's struggle in those first days, when Christian was in the NICU and it seemed that her world was crashing. She talks about her faith and specific verses that would come just when she needed hope and inspiration. Throughout the book, Lacey gives God the glory but also some of the blame. She went through the \"why me, why my son\" and lets the reader see her doubts and her confidence in God. As I was reading this book, I remembered when I first saw Lacey and Christian here: https://youtu.be/oWCbkyR0cy0 This link showed up in my Facebook feed, shared by a friend. I watched this video and had tears flowing down my face. I sought her our on Facebook and \"friended\" her. To my surprise, she accepted my request and I have followed her and her family for several years. She does not sugar-coat her story. In her book, she tells it like it is. Ups, downs, hurts, and successes are all shared with the reader. I really liked the way her book is written, like she is having a conversation with just the person reading her story. I highly recommend this book for those who need inspiration and especially for those who have struggled with the same issues of not being heard. What people need to remember is that children are just children, whether they have special needs or not. We love our children BECAUSE they are our children, even before they draw their first breath of air.

The way Lacey Buchanan told her story in Through Eyes of Hope is captivating and heart-wrenching. She shares her story with honesty through sharing all the details of how each challenge she faced effected her. Her overall, the story is an encouragement that even during our difficult times in life God can and will bring something beautiful out of it. Her experiences challenged me to look at the various things I face in life through eyes of hope. Instead of dwelling upon all the things that are not working to look to all the ways God is working in those situations. Lacey's story of hope is a great read that connected me to her experience causing my heart to ache with hers at different moments. Lacey grew through her experiences. I grew through reading her story. I highly recommend reading Lacey's story, Through Eyes of Hope.

They refused to give up hope, and at times even had to challenge the medical community to get the very best health care they could for him. At times, tears flowed down my face as I read about the things this young family went through. As many of us probably do when we read stories like this, I wondered if I would cope as well as they have, and then find the strength to rise to the challenge. I honestly felt exhausted reading about Lacey\u2019s schedule when she got home from the hospital. May The Lord bless them and always make His face shine upon them. I don\u2019t see how anyone could read a book like this and not come to realize beyond a shadow of a doubt that God works in the lives of His children.

Her story became nationally known after a 7 minute you tube clip backed with Christian Music and flash cards of her story (anticipation, excitement, finding out of the disability, grief, confusion, and sadness when some suggested they would have been better off if they had aborted) went Viral. Watch it..it might make you cry. This book will of course appeal to strong pro-life conservative Christians. I admired how involved Lacey was with the details of Christian's medical and surgical care. At times she was not afraid to challenge insurance companies to get the best care and also challenge surgeons--and she was often right--helping her son to avoid unneeded surgery.4 stars.

At first she would try to hide him when she was in public and she questioned God about why He allowed her to have such a handicapped child. But she came to understand that God uses tragic circumstances for His glory and that her little boy's story needs to be told. She is open about the rocky time their marriage went through as they both dealt with this challenge in their own ways. It is a beautiful and heart-touching story. As far as the writing itself, I felt that she jumped around a lot and it wasn't really written in a chronological order so I felt that things were repeated and felt a bit confused about where and when certain things were happening.

It is written by the author (with the help of Bethany Jett) (and read by the author which can be it is really good or a nightmare but I enjoyed hearing the accent) It does skip around but a bit (not Chronological which might have been better for me because we talk about Chandler being born, but yet he is mentioned in early chapters.)

I love seeing pictures of sweet Christian and Chandler in my news feed on Facebook. This non-fiction read wasn\u2019t quite what I was expecting, it had more of the medical side of it all than I was expecting, for one.

The circumstances that she and her family have been dealt with go way beyond a physical deformity that their son was born with. This is really a story of a mother's love. I am a mother of two and yet I was in awe of the lengths Lacey went: her ability to listen to her mother's intuition and her bold presence throughout Christian's life. I found myself asking, \"Would I have done that? Would I have known to get that second opinion? Am I being the voice for my own children that I need to be?\" At the end of the book, she asks what did reading their story do for you? For me, it made me pay attention a little bit more, listen to that motherly instinct a little stronger and to not let mileage or money get in the way of what you know is right for your family. Living in the same small town as the Buchanan's, it is so easy to say \"Well, our town doesn't offer that so my children can't participate.\" But that should not be an excuse.
