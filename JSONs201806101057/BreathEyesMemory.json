The characters are weighed down with such misery and heartache as they shoulder the burden of nearly unbearable memories. These memories are carried within the women of this story and are passed through the generations where they persist and wreak havoc on the psyches of both mothers and daughters. Sophie has been raised in Haiti by her Tante Atie for the first twelve years of her life. Sophie\u2019s mother, carrying a shame she could not bear, fled to New York to escape a past that haunts her. Sophie has led a reasonably happy life for a child living in a poor country rife with political unrest and violence. \"We come from a place, where in one instant, you can lose your father and all your other dreams.\" When her mother finally sends for Sophie, Sophie does not want to leave but has no choice. She does not know this mother and she will be leaving behind the one she has always thought of as her \u201cmother.\u201d Not only that, she is also faced with the challenges of immigrating to a foreign country. \"My mother said it was important that I learn English quickly. Otherwise, the American students would make fun of me or, even worse, beat me.\" Sophie will need to adapt quickly, and learn about her mother and her mother\u2019s demons that torment her dreams each night. But when pain begets further pain in a relentless cycle, Sophie will need to return to her roots to discover the truth and begin the slow process of healing.What I loved most about Breath, Eyes, Memory were some of the lyrical descriptions of Haiti and its people. Danticat does this so well. The bonds between women \u2013 sisters, mothers, daughters, grandmothers \u2013 are also explored and are fascinating, complex and often heartbreaking. Certain traditions that are passed on are simply shocking and perplexing. What I found to be lacking in this novel, however, was a feeling of connection to any of these women. The dialogue felt abrupt and distant. The closeness I expected to feel with these women was just not there; although I did feel compassion for them in general. There were some big jumps in time that may have caused the character development to suffer. The sense of a cohesive plot was missing at times as well. In some ways, aside from the very heavy and unsettling topics within these pages, I got the sense this was more like a YA novel. Not that I\u2019d recommend this to a young adult because I personally would not. Perhaps it was the relatively young age of the author at the time this was written that came through to me. Nevertheless, she is still to be applauded for taking on these tough themes and I do think she has much to offer. I enjoyed The Farming of Bones more than this and would recommend that if you have not yet read anything by Edwidge Danticat. This one gets 2.5 stars rounded up."}, {"userName": "Rowena", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena", "userReview": "\u201cThe tale is not a tale unless I tell. Let the words bring wings to our feet.\u201d - Edwidge Danticat, \u201cBreath, Eyes, Memory.\u201dMy first read for Black History Month, \u201cBreath, Eyes, Memory\u201d is Edwidge Danticat\u2019s first novel and I loved it. This writer introduced me to Haitian literature over a decade ago and I feel strong feelings of kinship with her.This was a beautiful and moving story about a young Haitian girl named Sophia, whose mother leaves her with an aunt in Haiti as a baby and moves to New York to escape bad memories and get a better life for herself. When Sophia is finally reunited with her mother at the age of 12, she is a girl wise beyond her years, trying to navigate herself in an unfamiliar environment, using a strange language, with a mother she doesn\u2019t really know: \u201cNight had just fallen. Lights glowed everywhere. A long string of cars sped along the highway, each like a single diamond on a very long bracelet.\u201dI was struck by that description. How would the busy streets of NYC look to a young girl freshly arrived from the Third World?I\u2019ve heard far too many stories of families separated by immigration. We hear about families reuniting but rarely do we hear about the difficulties they face trying to re-adapt to each other and make up for lost time. Danticat brings these issues to the forefront.Despite depicting some of Haiti\u2019s violent history, it was a hopeful book, one infused with Haitian thought and mentality, mostly through stories, songs and the grandmother\u2019s wisdom, the grandmother, who like mine, has been preparing for her own funeral for years. The part about the grandmother definitely touched me; it hit very close to home.The descriptions of Haiti were evocative; it felt like Danticat was drawing from her own memories there:\u201cThe mid-morning sky looked like an old quilt, with long bands of red and indigo stretching their way past drifting clouds. Like everything else, eventually even the rainbows disappeared.\u201dI know this book will speak a lot to a lot of immigrants, especially those who question where home is. Being stuck between two worlds as well as experiencing the generation gap is a double whammy for many immigrant kids. Old practices continue to take place in their new home; however, with a new westernized mentality it can all be hard to take. The unbelievable stress a young immigrant faces having to live up to high expectations, after all their family sacrificed so much for them to have a better life is something that is a real issue:\u201cIf you make something of yourself in life, we will all succeed. You can raise our heads.\u201dReading this made me dwell on how much the world is changing. My first language is different from my mother\u2019s and my grandparents\u2019, I can\u2019t even communicate with some of my relatives because we don\u2019t have a language in common. My relatives are spread out all across the globe. Changes beget changes and questions about identity and the value of tradition abound."}, {"userName": "Taryn Pierson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn-pierson", "userReview": "Immediately prioritized this book by a Haitian-American writer after reading about the \"shithole countries\" comment, and I'm so glad I did. There's so much going on artistically, it leaves you in awe even as it breaks your heart.Sophie grows up in Haiti with her aunt until age 12, when she is sent to New York City to live with her mother. It would be hard enough to live between two places, never having a true sense of home, but Sophie\u2019s life is further shadowed by the painful knowledge of why her mother couldn\u2019t raise her (which I won\u2019t spoil here). Danticat explores how the legacy of violence and hurt are inherited by each new generation, and the herculean effort of will required to break those patterns.Even though thematically this is a tough book to read, the prose is spare and the pages fly. I never could decide if I wanted to speed up so the pain would be over, or if I wanted to slow down and let myself feel the impact. This is the kind of book you could read over and over and still not catch everything Danticat is doing, but I don\u2019t think my heart could handle multiple close readings.At the back of my paperback copy, the publisher includes a note from Danticat addressed to her character, Sophie, in which she says she feels compelled to explain that not all children growing up in Haiti suffer exactly like Sophie does. Apparently some readers of the book have not understood that one character\u2019s experiences from one fictional work cannot be generalized over the actual human population of an entire country. It created uncomfortable resonance when, after reading her eloquent response to the \u201cshithole\u201d comment, it occurred to me that Danticat is still, all these years later, having to explain herself to an audience of ignorants.More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"}, {"userName": "Zanna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna", "userReview": "I think this story is about how women are traumatised by each other under patriarchy; how trauma makes us pass on trauma and abuse even especially to those we love. I found the story achingly sad, since the only way to break the cycle, to refuse to pass on the pain, is to free yourself somewhat from the one who hurt you, to break your connection with them on some level, even if you continue to love and care for them.Apart from this deep insight into the violence wreaked upon girls and woman and the chain of suffering and re-victimisation that comes out of it, and the limited possibilities for healing, I enjoyed this book for its sonorous poetry. The part when our protagonist, Sophie, returns from New York City to stay with her Tante Atie and grandmother is strikingly beautiful. The poet who is the author\u2019s proxy here is the driver of the bus in which Sophie travels with her baby daughter. He flirts with her, and flirting is a very dangerous art to practice because it may be violence, even if the intent is not selfish, and not to harm. It may be safer never to flirt, and similarly it may be safer to reject all sexual contact and retreat to a monastery (and there may be an awesome beautiful life there too) but maybe we can also tread the difficult path and find liberatory ways of engaging in such dangerous acts\u2026Here I think the driver\u2019s flirting is relatively safe, because Sophie with her daughter Brigitte, and her wedding ring, feels neither vulnerable (problematically, she has a protected status conferred a legal proven attachment to some man) nor desireable at the point when the driver praises her as if he were making her into a religion. We do not find out how Sophie feels about the driver\u2019s attentions, except insofar as she continues to respond conversationally to him. Our attention is drawn to how her beauty grants her the privilege of the best seat on the bus. The world is neither as kind nor as equal as we would wish. Comfort and tenderness are paid for in treacherous currencies. Sophie is journeying away from people whose love for her expresses itself in demands, towards the refuge of Tante Atie, who refused her poem, her love-offering, out of selflessness. Peace and refuge and consolation and healing are found in love that asks nothing in return. The driver\u2019s reverence, with its language of consuming and possessing, perhaps marks a transition between those who love her greedily, and those who love and accept and shelter her without conditions:Great god in Guinea, you are beautiful\u2026 I would crawl inside your dress and live there. I can feed on your beauty like a leech feeds on blood. I would live and die for you. More than the sky loves its stars. More than the night loves its moon. More than the sea loves its mermaids.(Is the sea terrible or is it, for mermaids at least, refuge?) Despite the potentially frightening hunger of his words, his devotion is poured out on the dry ground of Sophie\u2019s merely polite reponse like a libation. She has the power (with the help of her women-relatives and friends) to temporarily retreat from those fearful promises. Maybe it is a choice between passion and peace. When and where and how will we be able to offer each other both?"}, {"userName": "Sammy", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103544-sammy", "userReview": "*sigh* Okay, what did I think of the book, what did I think? Well, by my grade I'm sure you can tell I wasn't too fond of the book and didn't like it all that much. I wish I could leave it at that, but I'm a person who's solidly against criticisms without any sort of reason to back it up with. So... let's explain why I didn't really like it...First of all, the story itself really didn't interest me at all. Sure there were moments that I couldn't put it down, but most of the time I was bored by it. Maybe because I didn't share any ties or connections to it. In many stories, to feel any sort of attraction or pull to it, you sort of have to have some sort of thing to relate to it with. This book I didn't really have that. I think other people could just as easily relate to and enjoy this story much more than I could.I think I also didn't like the story because it didn't seem that developed. It still seemed to be in a younger stage of writing, and possibly that's Edwidge Danticat's style, but I think it would have enriched and helped the story so much more if she had added more detail to it. It was very simple in many ways. And I don't want to think that she's trying to reflect the simplicity of the Haitian people or something, because Haiti and this time they're all living in is not simple at all. It's rich in color and thick with strife. And New York is a hustle and bustle of different people and business, while love is a full and strong emotion. None of that was explored, and I know the book could have been so much more had it been.Once again I had a time issue on my hands. In such a short book I can understand why Sophie suddenly jumped in age, but it was difficult and a bit confusing to follow. Especially because it seemed so much happened in between the two different ages and it felt like I was expected to know what happened. I don't mind it when we have time switches on our hands... it's just I like it when it's a smooth switch, or it's explained in a smooth way, or just... it's not as choppy as it was in this story.This book could very well be a wonderful book for someone else to read... but for me... well, it just wasn't my style."}, {"userName": "Dominic", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2551271-dominic", "userReview": "This is a quiet but beautiful book. While it may not shimmer with literary acrobatics, its prose is clear as water, and the narrative structure literally tugs the reader through it. Had I the time, I could have read this in one sitting. It's that effortless. And yes, Danticat was only 24 when she wrote it!At times I wanted Danticat to take me deeper into the complex lives of this multi-generational circle of women and the unspoken pasts that haunt them. Many of the 35 chapters are brief and/or fragmentary. The plot drives on when I wanted it to linger. Yet by the final third of the novel, I appreciated her sparse, crisp style. This is not a book heavy on style; much of it is dialog, for instance. Instead this novel is a celebration of storytelling and the bonds--both fractured and sound--between mothers and daughters. Breath, Eyes, Memory delves into issues of regret and anger and forgiveness and letting go the ghosts of our pasts and healing from hurt. And her characters are so brilliantly drawn, the message so profound. Stick with it to the end, and you'll be rewarded.I couldn't help but think of other great novels while reading this one: Kingston's The Woman Warrior, Hosseini's The Kite Runner, and Amy Tan's The Bonesetter's Daughter. Breath, Eyes, Memory certainly belongs in this esteemed group of novels. I also highly recommend her second work, Krik?

But does Danticat ever write happy stories? (Because 'Krik? Krak!' had some sad elements in most of the short stories lol). I don't even know how to review this... Breath, Eyes, Memory is a sad book that is written in such a calm manner - Danticat style! Its deep with so many issues that span across 3 generations of women. Grandma If\u00e9 (Manman) and her daughters -Tante Atie, Martine (who moved to NY) and her granddaughter Sophie (the main character of this book) seem to be victims of terrible circumstances, constantly living in a nightmare. I have questions though: was Tante Atie a lesbian? Her relationship and attachment with Louise made me think so... Also, was Martine suffering from psychosis?Reading this book teaches you to empathize with others. So many people in this world are going through shit. Some women can't sleep at night because of sexual abuse; Some (women) hate themselves and their bodies because of sexual abuse; Some peoples' marriages are suffering because of sexual abuse from the past; Cultural/Family practices that police girls' sexuality have severe, adverse effects on women. There are so many layers to this tale and Danticat's passionate writing definitely makes you empathize.

This book is about the relationship between a mother and a daughter who had not seen each other for a long period of time. This book relates to me in so many ways. When Manman sees her daughter for the very first time she took her as like she was a fragile glass. As for Sophie, she didn't see her mother that way, she thought she wasn't her mother, due to her abandoning. However, after many years of getting to know each other they shared one body. They had about the same feelings, nightmares and childhood. But when Sophie's mother dies she realizes that everything her mother ever did was just for her. Now Sophie has to raise up her child in a way she doesn't have to feel the pain that Sophie and her mother had gone through.I recommend this book to anyone because it really shows a relationship of a daughter and a mother.

Growing up, the sisters' purity was carefully guarded by the humiliating practice of testing. Yet Martine was raped at age sixteen, while Atie, betrayed by her fianc\u00c3\u00a9, never married. Neither achieved the womanhood for which she was groomed, suggesting at first that this is the source of their unhappiness. But the ultimate force of their stories reveals a troubling commonality between 'pure' and fallen women. The sisters' twin tragedies evidence the toll of a lifetime ofdoubling, of living in an environment which keeps the woman uncomfortable in her body.The cult of female purity centers on an obsession with the woman's body, as it is elevated to the status of sacred object. It is no longer the woman's own, but instead a symbolic vessel of honor, whose utility and purpose are decided by others. In this context, the woman is alienated from her body, trapped by the weight of her woman's flesh. Martine's rape gives way to madness, nightmares, hallucinations and voices, as violence done to her body is perpetuated by her body's continual violence against her soul. The details of Martine's suicide suggest an attempt to destroy the rapist's body, which has become indistinguishable from her own. Thus, while Martine's experience represents a more dramatic version of the imprisonment that her female contemporaries feel, it is a difference only of scale. Atie's turn to alcohol represents a similar escape, an attempt to negate the physicality of her failed womanhood and the broader physical trap of being stuck in Dame Marie. The residual effects of the virginity cult are visible in Sophie's inability to have sex without doubling, and her own difficulty with her body in the novel's final sections. It is Sophie's conscious attempts to address this split, to reconcile her body and soul via therapy, narrative and love, which evince a power to move beyond the tragedy of her mother's and aunt's experience."}, {"userName": "Bajen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10257989-bajen", "userReview": "Women go through painful stuff in so many places around the world.

First things first, I found this book to be brilliant.I honestly don't know that much about Haiti as a country or a culture. I of course know about the earthquake that struck the country in 2010. It was all over the U.S. press and friends of mine had fundraisers and donations drives. I also had friends in the State department who chose to volunteer to go to Haiti to do what they could. One of my friends still won't talk about being down there in the aftermath and said that he would never forget what a luxury it is to have hot water. It's sad to see that after the initial few months of assistance by our country and others, Haiti is still stuck trying to rebuild (seehttp://time.com/3662225/haiti-earthqu...). Reading this book let me glimpse upon the inner workings of a family that had only women left to usher in the new generation. The character of Sophie will break your heart again and again throughout this book.Told in the first person in four parts, we follow Sophie from the age of 12 until she I think based on the timeline of the story is 20 possibly 21.When the book begins Sophie is a 12 year old girl happily living with her Aunt (Tante Atie) in Haiti. She knows that her real mother lives in New York, but sees New York and her mother as a far off place she will never see again. That all changes when her mother sends for her. Part two picks up when Sophie is 18 about to go to college, part three shows her with her newborn daughter in Haiti, and part four shows her back in the United States. The flow of the book was perfect after the first couple of chapters. I thought that the book really started to get going after Sophie's mother sends for her. The description of Haiti, the smells, colors, and food made me feel as I was right there. I initially called this a memoir since the way that Edwidge Danticat writes it feels as if she is relaying something truly personal that may have happened to her and is using Sophie as her stand-in so to speak.Reading about the inner workings of those that live in Haiti and worked the sugar cane crops was fascinating. Also reading about how the relationship between mothers and daughters was more important than a relationship that a woman had with any man that came after.Some of the plot points were shocking (warning there is discussion of rape and self-harm in this book) and often saddening. Reading how Sophie felt apart and different from others in the U.S., how many Haitians used bleach to lighten their skin, frank discussions about rape, murder, and death made this whole book an engrossing read.I think of this book as the Haitian version of the Joy Luck Club since we ultimately do focus on Sophie and the relationship that she has with her two mothers (her aunt and her real mother).I have a favorite passage in the book which I loved, but I can't share it because it would spoil the ending to those of you that may want to read it. I loved everything about the words that were written, the poetry of them, the sense of loss and longing that I got as I read. This is definitely going to be another go to the bookstore and buy permanently book. I did go to her author page on Amazon,(see Edwidge Danticat's Amazon Author Page) and was floored to see how many books she has written. I am definitely going to have to go and read some of her other works since I loved this book so much."}, {"userName": "Ifeyinwa", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5587447-ifeyinwa", "userReview": "Thanks to Isabelle for making me bump this book up my TBR list.

As much as I enjoyed Danticat's delicate writing, there were parts of the novel that felt stagnant (when Sophie returns to Haiti with her daughter) or gaps in time that left me dissatisfied. Regardless, I really appreciated reading a novel that explores generational bonds between women, trauma, mental health and how the burden of purity (placed on women) can be oppressive."}, {"userName": "La Tonya  Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32053623-la-tonya-jordan", "userReview": "It was a chilling story of love, sexuality, and freedom. Can you truly find freedom after a rape attack when everthing in your culture puts your virginity above everything? Hating yourself, hating your child, and finally taking your life seems to be taking matters to the extreme for Marteve. Sophie trying to free herself from the pain of being tested for her virginity and trying to please her husband. She was separated from her aunt to something that was suppose to be better without understanding why. Tante Atie had no life when Sophie left. She had no reason to exist.

Author Edwidge Danticat introduces readers to the Caco women, who embodied strength and resiliency, but who also harbored a dark past. Set in Haiti as well as within the Haitian community in New York, this novel also addresses controversial cultural practices, and how they impact the lives of women.  This was such a great book, that I was upset with myself that I waited so long to read it. From the first page to the very last word, I was completely enthralled by the novel, and am looking forward to reading other works by Danticat."}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80407-casey", "userReview": "This is a great, if disturbing, book. It's funny how an outsider's view of culture changes her own understanding of right and wrong. Let me clarify: because I was reading about Haitians in Haiti and then in New York (a group of people I'm not familiar with), I was less critical of certain characters' actions. I became, simply, an observer. Silly me. Because of this oversight, it didn't even occur to me that Sophie's mother was sexually abusing her. Maybe this is the point--in a certain context, something horrible can appear so normal, even routine."}, {"userName": "Saleh MoonWalker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66648866-saleh-moonwalker", "userReview": "Onvan : Breath, Eyes, Memory - Nevisande : Edwidge Danticat - ISBN : 037570504X - ISBN13 : 9780375705045 - Dar 234 Safhe - Saal e Chap : 1994"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7438991-michelle", "userReview": "Beautifully writtenThis had me sobbing in the end...at work.

It is tightly constructed although with a very linear plot. The story is of a Haitian girl who, as an 18 year old, comes to join her mother in America. The book spans 15 years and switches back and forth between the family in Brooklyn and family back in Haiti. Insights into Haitian customs and the way of life permeate the entire book.The mother in the book, we find out early on, was raped by a stranger and gave birth to Sophie. The mother has nightmares about the rape for the rest of her life. There is some uncomfortable subject matter, a customary gynecological purity test performed by mothers on their teenage daughters that figures prominently. Some of these fears are passed to Sophie as she herself progresses through motherhood. There is a sad scene at the end of the book that is not totally unexpected. Overall, I think the plot is interesting enough, consistent and vivid. In closing, the author did a decent job with female character development and conveyed a lot of Haitian customs that were interesting and gave the book its authenticity."}, {"userName": "Laura Hoffman Brauman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2597121-laura-hoffman-brauman", "userReview": "Danticat is an exquisite writer. This novel looks at the relationships between mothers and daughters, between love and grief, between shame and tenderness. After being raised for many years by her aunt in Haiti, Sophie, now 12, is sent to join her mother in New York. Sophie finds out that she was the result of her mother's rape as a 16 year old girl in Haiti and the effects of that rape have ramifications that have cascaded through the years. Not easy subject matter, but Danticat handles it deftly."}, {"userName": "Carolyn Gerk", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2105161-carolyn-gerk", "userReview": "Breath, Eyes, Memory is a story of some very emotional topics told with a startling lack of connection and feeling. Main character Sophie, at the novel's start, a young girl in Haiti is abruptly shipped off to America to be with her awkward and equally numb mother. Sophie adjusts amazingly quickly, and we are transported to the future, to meet eighteen year old Sophie. Sophie endures some unpleasant experiences at the hand of her tortured mother ( I can only relay that her mother is tortured because she matter of factly refers to her nightmares, her anxiety and her own teetering on the brink of insanity as she is plagued by memories of the rape that lead to Sophie's birth). Her mother finds it necessary to 'test' Sophie to ensure her virginity. I don't claim to lessen the impact of what is suggested here, but it is depicted in such a way that the seriousness is subdued. Sophie suddenly jumps to the conclusion that she must essentially mutilate herself to simulate the loss of her virginity, seeing this as the only way to stop the tests and to be with the man she loves (again, this love is depicted in SUCH a detached way).Later, Sophie returns to Haiti for an inexplicable visit. She apparently is, herself, tortured by the tests her mother performed on her. She is bulimic (if this is something that was acknowledged before she blatantly states it, I missed that) and attends a sex phobia support group (that seems less than helpful). Sophie is certain she will lose her husband if she cannot have sex with him (an act she has done only once, conveniently resulting in a daughter.). Her husband tells her he will not pressure her, but then says things like, 'if our skin touches, I will not be able to resist you.'. In part four, we spend more time with Sophie and her mother, who have reconciled. Her mother is again at the mercy of her own demons, all the while trying to reestablish a relationship with her daughter, who, despite her own feelings, is desperate to avoid her past conflicts. Primarily, this novel is about mental anguish (also featuring some focus on Sophie's aunt and grandmother), female purity and a damaging lack of communication. I found it to be clumsy and poorly paced, at times I could power through pages and pages of dialogue that seemed to have no connection to anything else. I found a lot of what I read to be unnecessary, and in such a short book, that's fairly discouraging. The largest issue is that I could connect with none of the characters. Sophie and her mother, the main focus of the novel and those with the most tortured pasts relive those moments with such disconnect and numbness that it left me feeling equally as detached from their struggles. I didn't get what was meant to be so great about this one. There were some poignant uses of language and the depictions of Haiti were at times charming (and at times startling). There is a blend of mythology and history that has promise, but when combined with such inappealing characters and delivery, it falls entirely flat, for me."}, {"userName": " Imani \u2665 \u262e", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3199356-imani", "userReview": "There is quite a bit of unpacking to do for this one. Danticat is such an amazing writer, in ways I was not expecting. Her prose is simple, almost incomparable to books of similar nature or topic that mostly end up convoluted. I do remember Danticat from The Royal Diary series where she had a fictitious account of a Taino princess. I mention that because while this was definitely mature subject matter, there was almost something childlike simple about the writing. I could have picked up the book at the same age I did the aforementioned and have slipped into this beautiful, heartbreaking writing. I am glad I did not because that would be a bit too much for a 14 year old but I digress.More or less, I think that this book really did provide a window into the grief women can carry despite everything. The women in this story attempted many things to forget their pain and grief - from immigration to another country, to taking their bodies into their own hands. Grief, as the characters realize, follow them everywhere. And there's no pithy lesson in here about learning to overcome the past, or looking forward to the future. Along with all the grief the women in Sophie's life experience, she also encounters some of her own. It's an amazing story, full of emotional depth that I didn't really understand was there until I finished the book. As for recommended, I do not advise this book be read by children (not that they wouldn't be able to handle it necessarily but because they may not pick up on some of the nuance, which was essential for this one). But I think that it is an important book and one that should be read by anyone that is interested in the culture of Haiti, something which I am grateful to have found more about via this book. I also recommend it for Alice Walker fans."}, {"userName": "Shaima", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49644355-shaima", "userReview": "I. The book that I have read is called Breath Eyes Memory written by Edwidge Danticat \tII. This book takes place in Haiti and New York City\tIII. The Major characters are Sophie, Sophie's mother and grandma and her aunt as well.The problem was that Sophie's mother was raped when she was young and she got pregnant with a child she did not want, so Sophie did not see her mother until she was twelve years old and her grandmother was raising her while her mother lived in New York. II. Resolution: The problem was kind of solved by reuniting Sophie with the mother she never saw but always heard about, another problem Sophie faced was that she had to move to New York City, this was a problem because she had to acclaim to a different culture.\tI. This book entertained me because it was very strange and I enjoyed learning something new I also enjoyed the culture the book introduced. \tII. The book met my expectation and it is really fun to read. \tIII. The choice I wish the author made was if we found out who the father was because it was spice things up and it would be a cool twist to the book. I. Overall I would recommend this book to be read by others because it is really interesting full of surprises but I do not recommend it for children under 14. \tII. The Ideal person you would read about is Sophie mostly because the book is based on her life and hardships she has to face thought her life time. III. After reading this book, I will read more cultural books because I did not expect this book to be this good but it changed my point of view in being open to every book because every book has a different and interesting moral"}], "description": "At an astonishingly young age, Edwidge Danticat has become one of our most celebrated new novelists, a writer who evokes the wonder, terror, and heartache of her native Haiti--and the enduring strength of Haiti's women--with a vibrant imagery and narrative grace that bear witness to her people's suffering and courage.\u00a0\u00a0At the age of twelve, Sophie Caco is sent from her impoverished village of Croix-des-Rosets to New York, to be reunited with a mother she barely remembers.
