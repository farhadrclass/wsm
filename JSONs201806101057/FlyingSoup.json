After all free is my favorite price :-) As with most amazon free books that are not archives, I had to add this one to goodreads. Going into this fairly blind was a little scary. What was I was committing to? The book ended up being really good. I really want to give this book 4 stars. I think this book was better than perhaps some other books I rated 4 stars. What really held it back for me was the spoken language in it. The author really wants to make sure that you know you are dealing with some college boys and will go to great exaggerated lengths to remind the reader of that. Can be painful \"bro.\"There also a protagonist who takes on the role of the heavy handed, outspoken, fall over right mega-church preacher. Extremest would be putting it lightly. To be honest, it certainly covers the stereotypes that go along with the presented personality. I thought it played well into the category, but may have pushed it a little too far beyond reasonable belief when asking followers to commit certain deeds through a public media. I don't know.. maybe not. This is a SOLID read and can be found on Amazon for free right now. Pick it up and read it. And please take my three star review with a grain of salt... Its probably better than that and I can be pretty harsh, and this site really needs a ten point scale. (edit)Who cares, it was a page turner, back to 4 stars... and did I mention it was free?"}, {"userName": "Judie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10820707-judie", "userReview": "FLYING SOUP begins with a truck driver deliberately trying to wipe out a bicyclist. Once he realized Christian had survived flying over the hood, the driver left, after running over the $5000 bike. Christian lives with two schoolmates, Mohamed, who is a Conservative black Christian and Buster, who is a gay white liberal. Christian\u2019s friends commiserate with him and when Christian says he wouldn\u2019t be able to identify the truck driver or vehicle, say it\u2019s too bad he wasn\u2019t wearing a PRD (personal recording device) so he would have the license plate number as well as the details of the incident.\tThey complain how too many drivers deliberately try to cause cyclists to have accidents or near misses and how drivers, who may be very nice people, change aggressively when they are behind the wheel and can act anonymously to people they would never see again. The friends get the idea that if bicycle riders and car drivers had PRDs, they could get videos of these events and post them on-line in an attempt for drivers to become more courteous. \tTurns out that Buster has invented such a device for bicyclists. It has four cameras, two facing forward from the helmet and the bike and two facing the rear. He installs them on Christian\u2019s helmet and bike and soon they get a video of two youths throwing a can of tomato soup at him. They decide that they can make money by setting up a website (SoupCan.com) posting the video, selling the PRD set, and charging a small users fee to people who are similarly incensed by rude drivers and want to share their experiences. \tFrom the video, Buster was able to identify the car. Christian went to the house to let the boy\u2019s parents know what happened so they could take action. He gave them the can and a copy of the video and let them know he had no interest in reporting it to the police. It turns out that Hoffman Philpot, the father of one of the boy, is a prominent minister of a megachurch. \tBob Patterson, Philpot\u2019s superior of announced, he was going to run for the Presidency of the US because the country is turning away from God. He explains that Article III of the Bill of Rights prohibits Congress from establishing a religion or prohibiting its exercise. But, he continued, Article XII allows the States or the people from doing so. From there on, much of the story discusses hypocrisy among fundamentalist preachers and other members of their groups.\tThe other main plot is the growth of SoupCan.com. \tMany of the observations in this satirical novel are often heard in today\u2019s society: \t\t\u201cWhy does he have to be a lunatic just because he\u2019s got an unassailable faith in God and a vision for America?\u201d \t\t \u201cNo, I don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s a ignorant, racist, homophobe who wants to make our country into a fascist theocracy.\u201d \u201cThe philosophy of a fascist government and the philosophy of a theocracy are almost mutually exclusive.\u201d \u201cWhen you hate everybody who\u2019s not just like you, it doesn\u2019t matter why you do it, you do it just the same.\u201d\t\t\u201cI you place your faith in another man and rescind your critical thought processes where a human is concerned, you\u2019re making a big mistake.\u201d\t\t\u201cJustice isn\u2019t about truth, or right or wrong. Justice is about money. How much money you\u2019re willing to spend determines how much justice you can buy.\u201d\t\u201cPeople build their opinions based on their belief system, not on the evidence.\u201d\tAs is true in many satires, the characters tend to be exaggerated stereotypes. I almost made a mistake by giving up on FLYING SOUP after the first few chapters. There was too much profanity and, too a lesser degree at that point, too much technical internet website information. (None geek readers can skip most of that without losing any of the storyline or plot.) But I won the book in a Goodreads contest and felt obligated to try to finish it and write a review. In addition, the author\u2019s cover letter began \u201cDear Whatever-Your-Name-Is\u201d which was crossed out and my name was handwritten over it. And, the biographical information, summary, and recommendations on the back cover set the mood for humor and satire.\t I have downloaded another of Bobby Adair\u2019s books. I received a copy of this book as a Goodreads First Reads winner."}, {"userName": "Molly Anna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17319337-molly-anna", "userReview": "The premise of this satirical novel involves hidden cameras, turn of the millennium technology and stock markets, narrow-minded Christian fundamentalist pastors running for high-level political positions, and people acting like moronic idiots. The amusement relies heavily on many types of irony and ridiculous, seemingly over-the-top, \u201cshock-value\u201d characters. There were many times I found myself chuckling, but with this brand of humor, the true comedic satisfaction is in the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of the novel. As I mentioned, the characters can initially come across as grossly exaggerated, but I\u2019m a firm believer in Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s conviction that \u201clife is infinitely stranger than anything the mind could invent\u201d and this can certainly be applied here. All you have to do is flip on your TV to a televangelist program (preferably a Sunday edition), peruse the internet for far right-wing fundamentalist sites, or drive to your local Mega-Church and you will quickly learn that Adair\u2019s religious zealots are not as far-fetched as you first believed. The presumably twenty/early thirty-somethings are also not exempt from this rule. Sometimes their language sounds a bit dated (I had to keep reminding myself that the novel is set in the early 2000s) and some dialogues occasionally came across as \u201cforced,\u201d but overall, \u201cthe sodomite, the terrorist, and the peeper\u201d ended up being realistic, likeable characters. As for the writing style and pace, it is an easy, quick read with a calculated plot that at many times sucks you into the unfolding events. I liked the book more than I anticipated, and I would most likely recommend it to all my \u201cspiritual, but not religious,\u201d middle-of-the-political-road, good-humored friends and acquaintances."}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1634894-heidi", "userReview": "Christian Trist is a young guy who is working in the tech world. He loves to ride his bike, and he has no idea that one person\u2019s rude action toward him during a bike ride will affect his future. An anonymous passenger in a car throws and a can of soup at him while he is riding. His friend has attached a camera he developed to his bike so the whole thing is caught on video. From here his techy friends and Christian decide to put together a website designed to expose the anonymous jerks in people\u2019s lives. Their goal is to make lots of money, and maybe change society a little. They never realized what a website could do to their lives, and the other individual\u2019s lives who are involved with the incident.I didn\u2019t know what to expect from this book when I first picked it out. But I knew that I really liked the name. When I started reading the book I could really relate to the three techies in this book. While my friends aren\u2019t techies they are artists who sit around dreaming up new things, and ways to make it succeed. And even though parts of the book seem like it is attacking religion, and religious people. I didn\u2019t take it that way. I felt like the author was trying to use a humorous approach to point out some hypocrisy that is in organized religion. While the pastor in the book loses his way religiously, I felt like his best friend the Deacon was not the stereotype of a religious fanatic. I also liked that Christian really is a good person, who is smart and honest. He knows when to walk away so that he can really enjoy his life. Overall, this is a fun book to read, and don\u2019t take some of what is said too seriously. It is well written, and the characters are easy to relate to."}, {"userName": "Glori", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16069850-glori", "userReview": "Flying Soup has a fairly simple story line; three young men working in the tech world suddenly become multi-millionaires from a viral video shot of a reverend's son throwing a soup can at the book's main character Christian Trist. However, this book holds a deep message that reveals the hypocrisy and corruption in men of faith who begin to seek more than just God's guidance and pursue a life of power and greed. Honestly, I found this book to be more terrifying than funny because of how Adair depicts the darker side of faith in God, and how faith mixed with one's own personal agenda can be as deadly and evil as Satan himself. I won't lie, reading this book was not as easy as I expected because I felt as if the beginning dragged on too much. I didn't really like the long and boring dialogue in the first half, but once the story started to pick up, it became more bearable. Overall, I think that this story has a great meaning and true but terrifying message, and it's definitely a great reminder that church and state should never mix!!"}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18979687-paula", "userReview": "I received this book from the Goodreads First reads giveaway program.Flying Soup by Bobby Adair is about three buddies Christian Mohamed and Buster.

Imagine, if you will, three tech geeks that decide to set up a movie clip website to shame people that have annoyed them (and others). What would happen if the very first clip they post goes viral... and just happens to identify the culprit as the son of a conservative televangelist (with political leanings)? Basically, the story covers a lot of ground, some serious some not. The writing flows well, the characters are as developed as (I think) they have to be. There are some voyerism issues and a lot of basic crudeness that I suspect will turn some people off, but in a way I felt they added to the story. The really disturbing thing is that it all rings so very true. The world in the internet age really has gone this mad."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Van Wie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20370082-jennifer-van-wie", "userReview": "Excellent Book!Bobby Adair\u2019s writing style is witty and fluid. His plot is intricate and interesting as he weaves the story around Christian, Mohammed and Buster, three lifelong friends that discover a device to exact karma back on people that prey on others. This is a must read because his dialogue is funny and profound simultaneously. The characters are fully fleshed out three dimensional characters with real strengths and flaws that are intertwined with hypocritical religious and political elements. I find this book poignantly up to date to what is going on in the world around us. A true satirical blend of technology, religion and politics combined with the dreams of three men just trying to get ahead. Bravo Mr. Adair. A splendid book well worth the read!"}, {"userName": "Lo", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8303716-lo", "userReview": "Thank God for a stand-alone, satirical novel that I immensely enjoyed.

It has no pretensions other than to entertain, and that it does as events are set in motion. A guy starts out riding his bicycle and is nearly ran over. This leads to a chain of events that quickly escalate out of any of the characters' control. The intention to expose jerky behavior takes a political turn as well as launches a new wildly successful dot.com and well...things just get out of hand. Besides really over the top character names (and name calling), the story moves well with some unexpected twists and turns.
