The continuity and fluidity of this series\u2019 storyline makes the combining of reviews that much easier. Even if a listener had not heard the installments practically back-to-back, as I did, Angela Scott (the author) makes it extremely easy to jump back into the story as if it never ceased. This also makes it hard for me to recall precisely which installment certain events occurred in, which is not necessarily a negative thing. The continuous nature of the writing is one of the series\u2019 greatest appeals. There were miniscule bits and pieces of the storyline that bothered me from time to time, the main one being the steady weakening of the way the main character was written and my declining opinion of her that went along with it, but it was never enough to murk my overall opinion of her or of the story, in general. There were times towards the end of the second installment and especially in the third when I questioned the way she and Trace were written, but in reality, I was just being nitpicky and impatient. Having finished the series, I can clearly see that now. Which leaves my largest standing complaint as being the extremely graphic, vivid, and revolting descriptions. Before you yell at me, I know this is a zombie series. I\u2019m sure those kinds of descriptions are par for the course among zombie literature and there would probably be a lot more fans upset if that type of thing was excluded or watered down. Heck, the graphic nature of this series may pale in comparison to that of its contemporaries. I don\u2019t read enough zombie stories to know. I\u2019m just saying that, for me, it was a bit much. I quickly learned that I couldn\u2019t listen to this while eating or trying to fall asleep at night. Not big sacrifices. But there were a couple of times when I actually had to stop listening for a period because the descriptions were so stomach-turning. I don\u2019t consider myself overly squeamish either. Mind you, this type of thing may appeal to some listeners, but consider this a warning if you are not one of them. I would find it completely unnecessary and any other type of story, but in a zombie series, I\u2019m guessing mine was probably the intended reaction. And it isn\u2019t like the guts and gore didn\u2019t serve a purpose because that would have really disappointed me. It all added to the story\u2019s atmosphere. This story was woven together exceptionally well with relatable characters, plenty of heart warming moments, and some laughs thrown in as well. Speaking of heartwarming, let\u2019s talk about that epilogue. It positively made my heart swell and also made me ache for a spinoff series set several years in the future. The epilogue set the stage perfectly for that type of thing, should Angela Scott ever feel so inclined. I would definitely, definitely have to get my hands on that. I\u2019m salivating just thinking about it! I felt this series was extremely well-balanced, well-developed, and well-written. The Zombie West series tops my burgeoning list of favorite zombie stories, for sure.Narration review: Rebecca Roberts has become a premier narrator, in my mind, primarily because of her wide tonal range. Her ability to give each of the characters their own distinct voices, impacted my listening experience in the most positive of ways. It can be frustrating for audiobook listeners when character voices are not given enough distinction and individuality, especially because we don\u2019t have the visual cues that traditional book readers do to tell who is speaking. I understand that some narrators may not have the physical voice range of others, to no fault of their own, so it is always exciting to discover a narrator with Rebecca\u2019s vocal abilities. She showed wonderful discernment while narrating, particularly with the decision to transform her voice when switching in and out of character. She made the multiple point-of-view switches much more bearable than I normally would have considered them. And, most importantly, her voice had an overall pleasant quality (read: not annoying) that I found quite enjoyable. As an audiobook reviewer, I\u2019ve learned that the value of such a thing should never be overlooked! In addition to being a top tier narrator, I\u2019ve also found Ms. Roberts to be an extremely delightful conversationalist in our brief, but charming communications. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to her for her kindness and for introducing me to this wonderful series! \u2663\ufe0e\u279c This audiobook was graciously gifted to me by its narrator, Rebecca Roberts, in exchange for a review containing my honest thoughts and opinions.

Not a damn thing.~~~~~~The Zombie West Series caught me so off guard, that I fell in love with it and Angela Scott\u2019s writing. It is a unique and novel approach to Zombies, that will have you walking the plains, hand and hand with Red and her motley crew, desperately trying to survive.Imagine walking, walking, walking, no destination just walking. Nowhere is safe. Now imagine doing it while nine months pregnant.The characters were an unlikely bunch. In another time, they never would have met, let alone been friends and family. Alone, with everyone you ever knew dead or lost to you, you would be forced to trust. There is safety in numbers.The characters lived life fully, their emotions strong and their needs directed their actions. They never knew when their life would end, or maybe begin \u2013 in another form.Red is special and wanted. Some wanted her for good, others would stop at nothing to capture her, thinking she was their salvation.Angela\u2019s descriptions of the Zombies were amazing. They are called the Undead for a reason. I could see them shuffling along, being drawn from place to place by the smell of humans. Decomposing with every step they take.The fights are graphic and gruesome. Guts spilling out, a knife through the chin, brains blown away and an arrow through the eye are only a few of the groups attempts to kill the Zombies.Could you imagine needing clothes so badly, that you would strip them from the Undead? How long do you think it would take to get used to the smell, so you don\u2019t want to vomit with every breath you take.As the group pulled the Zombie from the river I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes. Hilarious description \u2013 a rope around neck its neck and the horses pulling and pulling\u2026..I loved that Angela could add humor to so much gruesomeness. After all, no matter how desperate the times are, a smile or a laugh can give you hope.The Zombie West Trilogy is a fantastic story of life and death, love and betrayal and trust and loyalty, after the world has gone to hell. The characters will have you laughing and crying as you walk through the Dead Plains with them. Every time you think of Zombies, you will want to pull out the Zombie West Trilogy and read it again. If you like Zombies, this is a Must Read!~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201cThere would be a burial, and grieving, and somehow\u2026.they\u2019d find a way to go on.\u201d\u201cThis was the best welcome back from the dead \u2013 woke up and puked.\u201d\u201c\u2026sometimes it is not meant for us to understand.

I love to read, and figured this would be a fun way I could take part in my community and get out of the house.It really is fun, and I have loved the discussions so far, but the first book we picked was a mine field of intellectualism, at the complete wrong time to read considering all the other things going on in life now.So, screw you Hemingway.We chose The Moveable Feast as our first book, and given the timing right before NaNoWriMo, and the 20,000 + words I should be turning into a novel (for ~5 plus years), it was a feat of sheer human strength that I managed to finish it by the deadline (yesterday).After some moving discussion, and my head almost exploding at the fact that Hemingway was really writing a memoir about not being able to write about life in Paris while writing about writing in Paris.Philosocat says: \u201cWhoa, Meta.\u201dYeah, you read that right. Hemingway wrote a memoir about his time in Paris (later compiled first by Mary Hemingway, then his grandson) and published posthumously. The two versions are quite different, and I by far prefer the newest one. I think it is truer to the autographs, and more in the style of Hemingway. It reads less like a memoir and more like \u201cOh GAWD, I\u2019m supposed to write a memoir about life in Paris, but I can\u2019t even write something worth keeping? I\u2019ll just go to this coffee-house, eat a baguette and write about trying to write a memoir of Paris now that I\u2019m back in Paris and see where that goes.\u201dIt goes like this:Mind Blown.Time for the apocalypse.Enter zombie relief in the form of the wondrous Angel Scott\u2019s Dead Plains.You might think talking about Hemingway and zombies in the same post/review will be tricky to navigate, but it turns out, Scott started writing the series as an exercise in creativity and to get out of her \u2018normal\u2019 genre. The blog article on Evolved Publishing\u2019s site is quite useful, especially for someone considering (finally) finishing that novel in November.I\u2019ve always been the type of person to find where writers get their inspiration interesting, and often useful in helping me write my own works. Blogger and historian MJ Wright is also a constant source of useful tips. Tips I plan to make use of this November, unless I end up with a fancy new job (that is a possibility).My brain has recently been wracked with all the uncertainty of finishing up at the Global Market, looking for work over the winter, starting studio piano and voice classes, and writing, marketing finishing up grant reports and applying for new ones. Hemingway was the constant nagging voice in the back of my head telling me to get out my pen. I may say screw you now, but he\u2019d understand, I don\u2019t really mean it. Scott, and her wild west zombies were my relief, and gave me some perspective. I.E. the apocalypse will not happen if I don\u2019t get that novel finished this November, except maybe in my head.I own all three of the books in the series (as e-books) and would highly recommend them to anyone who loves zombies, the wild west, or has just had their mind blown, and needs to seek escape from reality and play in an aftermath of zombies while their poor brain restores itself.I am NOT a zombie fan, in fact, I am one of those terrible people who hate zombies, have very high standards, and am so BORED with Walking Dead I probably won\u2019t finish watching the series until its (finally) over.I had fears about reading this series, fears that it would not meet my expectations, and I\u2019d have to write a less than stellar review. Perhaps it was the timing, or the fact that my brain had already gone nuclear and joined the world of zombies, but I really do believe I would have loved this book, and this series even if my mental state had been 100%.The ReviewWhile I didn\u2019t read this series in order, I would recommend that anyone else start from the beginning. I was under \u2018tight\u2019 (self-imposed) deadlines, and plan to go back and read the other two books in the series and this one again at the end.Still, the book was enjoyable, and while it\u2019s inspired me to read the whole series, it\u2019s not necessary to do that and enjoy the book. I\u2019m just of the opinion that more zombies are better, at least in this case.If you\u2019re a zombie lover, and want to know if this will stand up to your high-flouting needs, be assured that these zombies are believable. I can\u2019t speak to the other two books, but there are some great uses of every day items to ward off the undead, and some pretty interesting plot devices to deal with the combination of a \u2018wild-west\u2019 and a zombie apocalypse.The characters are endearing, and part of the reason I want to read the first two books is to get to know Red, Trace and the rest of the characters. I was particularly drawn to Trace, and really appreciated the fact that this book was not just a slaughter-house page after page. When I was young, I was obsessed with the mid-west and toured some great spots like Wild Bill Hickock\u2019s grave, The Pony Express somewhere and Deadwood. This book took me back to that time, and then gave me a whole cast of great characters to ride along with.There\u2019s really character development, plot lines, awesome description and a lot of fun to be had in 250 pages. The book is listed as being for young adults, but as a middle-aged, Hemingway blew my mind apart writer, I think this book is suitable for adults too. The birth of a child into a life filled with danger both of the western and zombie persuasion is well thought out, and incredibly well written. There\u2019s a reason this series has won awards. It\u2019s really quite the story, even if zombies or western\u2019s aren\u2019t your favorite genre. Somehow, the two combined make for what I think could be a pretty awesome action flick."}, {"userName": "Misty Baker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4056115-misty-baker", "userReview": "***As Posted on KindleObsessed Blog***Well ladies and gents, this is it. The last book in the Zombie West series, and I have to admit\u2026I\u2019m a tad concerned. Am I concerned that people won\u2019t enjoy it? No. Not in the slightest. Am I concerned that Angela has lost her ability to smoothly smash together to very different worlds? (Westerns and zombie fiction?) Nope. I\u2019m concerned that Ms. Scott is trying to give George R. R. Martin a run for his money...when it comes to axing people. (*insert dramatic music*)Yes, I AM aware that this is a zombie book, that people WILL inevitably die. (Hell, I watch the Walking Dead each week with the EXPECTATION that someone is going to kick it.) But I was shocked, SHOCKED I tell you by the extent of primary character deaths in this book! (Hence the Martin reference. That fool takes no prisoners.) Just when you think things are starting to go well for this tiny cast of characters BAM! Someone is lying out of their ass, getting turned into dynamite hash (wow, that was slightly insensitive) or being drained of all their blood by a mute medicine woman. (And that\u2019s just in the first half.)I may or may not have teared up a time or two (I admit to nothing!) but even that was quickly vanquished with gruesome (read: totally awesome) passages such as this:\u201cA legless zombie slid to the ground, raised himself on his bowed arms, and roared through his dangling jaw. Spittle clung to his chin as he pulled himself forward like a broken spider. His innards spilled on the ground, connecting him to the dirt like an umbilical cord, while his vacant eyes stayed transfixed on Trace. The determined zombie dragged himself along the aisle between the rows of rising undead.\u201dPretty gnarly right? Big ups to Ms. Scott for incorporating the words: spider, umbilical cord, and dangling jaw into 3 sentences. (That should totally warrant some sort of \u201cYou make sick sound uber-rad!\u201d prize.) But wait\u2026that\u2019s not all! Just when you think this 364 page jaunt through oogy oggy land can\u2019t get any worse, you read this:\u201cShe refused to believe that she\u2019d gained anything of real value by eating her placenta.\u201dIt\u2019s ok\u2026feel free to take a moment. I totally threw up in my mouth too. (Point. Angela.)But what about the STORY Misty???Ok, gore festivities aside, the plot (aka struggle for survival) found between the pages of \u201cDead Plains\u201d was (in my opinion) the BEST of the three. While yes, it did seemed to take a tad longer to get to the point\u2026the trials and tribulations faced along the way seemed more impactful than they had in the past. Red had to learn the difference between educated and blind trust. Trace was challenged more emotionally than he had been in the past. Wen was a little more front and center with HIS struggles. Rivers, crazy blonde machete girl, even Lasso (or Maverick depending on whose dog you think it actually is) had moments of true growth and heartache. (I\u2019m not joking..the dog is what prompted the crying.) So, even though the flow of the story slowed a bit (which was bound to happen since Red is pregnant in this story) the well-developed character drama helped even the lag out. (Aka: I didn\u2019t fall asleep while reading. That\u2019s always a good sign.)I wish I could tell you more but to be honest\u2026I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll throw more spoilers out than I intend to, so I\u2019ll leave you with this.\u201cDead Plains\u201d is a solid end to a solid zombie series. If blood and gut is your thing\u2026give these little gems a try. Oh, and make sure to read the epilogue at the end of this book. It\u2019s totally worth it.Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: You don\u2019t have to be faster than everyone, just SOMEONE."}, {"userName": "Nancy (The Avid Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7149266-nancy-the-avid-reader", "userReview": "I received a free copy of the book from the author for my honest opinion.In Dead Plains Red is pregnant with Trace's baby. Red, Trace, Wen, Caroline, Lily (Wen and Caroline's baby), Fisher, Rivers, Kitchi, Aponi and Davis, Red's brother are all out walking the Plains trying their best to just stay one step ahead of the zombies and any human that may want to take Red and use her as an experiment like John did in Survivor Roundup. Red is unlike other humans. She has a secret that everyone wants to know and wishes they had. They think that she is the answer to their zombie problems.The group is running out of supplies and is in dire need for more. So when they come upon a town Davis volunteers to go into the town for the supplies they need. Davis is gone for a while or is gone longer than Red thinks he should have been and she is worried about him. Kitchi being the great person he is says he will go and find Davis and bring him back. Kitchi maybe only a child to a white man but to the Indians and his people Kitchi is a man. He knows how to fight and he can take care of himself and others as well. There have been times on their journey that if it had not been for Kitchi some in the group probably would have died.Later Davis comes back with a team of horses and more supplies but no Kitchi. They all ask him about Kitchi. You know like where is he? What has happened to him? Davis tells them he never saw Kitchi going or coming. Trace has come to care a great deal about Kitchi. He loves him like a son. Davis wants to move the group along and get them back on their way. But Trace and Red will not leave Kitchi behind.Trace goes into the town to find Kitchi. When he gets there he finds out that Kitchi has been arrested and put in jail for stealing. Trace tries to get Kitchi back by making a deal with the sheriff. The deal that the sheriff makes with Trace is for him to whip Kitchi. Trace does not want to do this. He doesn't want to hurt the boy but he doesn't see any other way to get him out alive. So he whips Kitchi and then the sheriff lets him take Kitchi with him. Kitchi doesn't blame or hold it against Trace for what he did. He knows that he did the best that he could do and that it was the only choice he had if they both wanted to get out of there alive.All Red, Trace, Wen, Caroline and everyone else in their new little family want is just to find a safe place that they can call home, a place hidden away from other people so that there would be no one to recognize Red. But someone knows who Red is and what she is and they are out for blood. This person doesn't care about Red or her family all this person cares about his himself. I know you probably want to know who this person is. Am I right? Well guess what I really don't want to spoil the book for you so I am not going to tell you who this person is. You are going to have to pick up your copy to find out. But hey trust me you will definitely not be disappointed with Dead Plains. It is one of the best zombie books ever written.

Ever since the undead plague broke out, she's been on the run, fending for her life. For a time, it seemed as if everything was hunky-dory. She thought she had a chance in truly surviving on her own. Until the moment came, and she crossed paths with Trace Monroe.At first, he was a huge thorn in her side. He was someone who thought to bring her in, and cash in the reward on her head. But he soon learned that she was someone who was truly unique. Red can move amongst the undead, carefully picking her way through them, and eliminating them at every turn. Without meaning to, she turned the tide, and fell head-over-heels for Trace. Since then, they've been living from day-to-day, riding across the plains in search of a home of their own.Picking up stragglers along the way that would become a part of their growing family, Red has had to come to terms with who and what she is. In the harsh world surrounding her, she isn't sure if bringing the baby she now carries into the world is a good thing. Despite this fact, she's determined to make the most of the current situation. The undead might be taken care of as they go along their way, but many more come along in the blink of an eye. She knows the horde will never stop, and is determined in taking care of it in every way possible.As the eve of her child's birth grows ever closer, Red soon realizes that her world continues changing with every step she takes. Everywhere she looks, there are wolves in sheep's clothing. Not to mention that her beloved family dwindles by the day. Never-the=less, she's determined to make something of the little she and her family has left. Her family needs a place of its own. Something they can hold on to. She and Trace know it's out there somewhere. They just need to find it, even if it means they must keep hacking away at the oncoming undead in order to find it.Another great addition to the Zombie West series, Dead Plains will not disappoint. It picks up where there second book left off, and dives straight in to the dilemma Red and her family find themselves in. The dead are everywhere. They won't stop coming, and she now has a baby on the way. Granted, it's a baby that she didn't want, at first, but one that's grown on her, none-the-less.Angela continues to bring these beloved characters forth in a way that will tug on your heartstrings, making you root for them as they do their best to survive. I'm not sure if this truly the last book in the series, (I hope not!), but it definitely keeps you glued to every page. The author has taken the idea of zombies and introduced them to the Wild West in such a way that you actually wonder if such a thing could have happened back in the day. It's that good a series!

You're expectations are high, and the author has a lot to live up to in your fine-tuned reading eyes. Admittedly I expected a lot from Angela Scott as I started reading Dead Plains. I had been blown out of the water by Wanted: Dead or Undead, blasted out of the compound by Survivor Roundup. Dead Plains, had a few minor flaws that created baby hiccups as I read the story. Essentially the pace of the story suffered as the author tried to wrap every story line up into neat little packages. I felt that there were a couple of times that the story slowed to a drudging pace, almost as slow as the characters trek across the plains must have been. Is this a reason to avoid the book? Absolutely not! In fact, you will definitely want to read the conclusion of this intense story that has captured my heart with the cast of characters an intriguing plot. Scott has a lot to tell within this story, the finale for The Zombie West Series. Story lines and characters need to have closure. Creating the closure involves plot twists and turns and some new characters that must be introduced. Sadly, this is one of the issues I had with this edition of the series. I questioned if a set of characters that were created, needed to be a part of the story as long as they were. While they had a vital role to play for the story to roll forward, they arrived and then had no real interaction with the overall story until they were on their way to their original destination. So, you see that for an author, there are some predicaments when finishing a story. These characters however, do open some doors, in my personal opinion for some short stories that take you into their world.The plot of the final story includes many trials and tribulations, and the characters have to make some very hard decisions that change the dynamic of the plot and story flow. There will be some major earthquakes for the reader as you realize that in the end there will be beloved characters that will betray, be gone, and believe in different things that you originally thought. As an author, Scott stays true to her characters and the plot line that began with Wanted: Dead or Undead. I cried periodically during this book. Got angry, got scared, and got perplexed, just like the characters. Personally I was very saddened to read the epilogue and know that the story was at an end.

But the idea of ever finding one slipped further away with the impending arrival of the new baby.\u201d (Dead Plains, Angela Scott)The zombies made it all but impossible to settle down in one place for more then a day or so because they would sniff them out and sooner or later they would descend on the living with the desire to feed.\u2666 \u201cDon\u2019t do anything dangerous.\u201d She (Willa) smiled. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed simply being alive is dangerous.

Wanted: Dead or Undead and Survivor Roundup are the first and second books respectively in The Zombie West Series. Having read book three, Dead Plains, I now need to go back and read the first two books to find out more of the story that was hinted at in Dead Plains but not fully explained. The wonderful thing about Dead Plains was that even though I had not read the first two books I was able to plunge head first into the story and not feel frustrated or lost. That is a true sign of a great writer, being able to write a book in a series, which can be picked up and read even if the previous books have not yet been read.

That being explained up front, this series is totally awesome. Red, a strong, independent girl-woman who loses her family to the plague which turns people to zombies after a single bite. Resources are scarce, and scavenging for meager supplies (bullets and clothing) and food, make people distrustful of new-comers. A very pregnant Red, and her \u2018family\u2019 of survivors look for a place to put down roots. I like the twists in the plot, as well as the author's world building. There is a sadness to the greediness of people who need to take care of their own communities, shunning outsiders as another mouth to feed, and cutting into their supplies. There is no such thing as charity anymore, only barter. Another element to the story is Red\u2019s uniqueness, which makes her a target of people that see her as a possible way to end the madness, and find a cure. This sets up some philosophical questions: a) Is it right to kill the living and healthy, in an effort to cure the dead/zombies? b) Is it right to capture, contain, and experiment on one person for the possible (note: possible) chance of a cure? There are some who believe Red holds the secret of the cure in her blood, and they will stop at nothing to capture her for their experiments. Angela Scott has a great writing style, so I found the story engaging, completely overlooking by bias against zombies and the dreaded western. The books get progressively better - and this is the best (and last) book of the western zombie trilogy. An excellent wrap up to a great series. Many twists and turns I didn't see coming.

There was some heartache. Some Romance. More characters were added (I love the crazy chick!), but it is bittersweet couples with loss. There was some zombie slashing. I felt like it was a bit repetitive in some aspects, but makes up for it with some random twists you do not see coming. The journey is harder since Red is pregnant and wobbling around the west. She has more unfortunate thoughts and feelings she has to work through. Trace is still a little bit of a goof and has to navigate his own rough patches as well. Poor guy. I really felt for him in this book. The characters are pretty beaten by the third book, but cannot give up on their dream for a semi- normal life. This book broke my heart a little bit, but I loved the ending. The Epilogue was a great ending to tie up the books. I cannot wait to read Angela's other books. Everything just flows so well, and I can't help but like her characters. Like, I said, this book was a bit slower with less action. I think book one is still my favorite, but I really enjoyed the series. An interesting take on what would happen with zombies in the West. All in all, Dead Plains was a heartbreaking and raw read that put my emotions through the ringer, but made it all worth it in the end."}, {"userName": "Kysha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9725930-kysha", "userReview": "I was given Wanted Dead or Undead and as soon as I finished it I had to buy Survivor Roundup. Then I had to wait.I loved all 3 books equally. There is a very good flow between them. Nothing is left out or skipped from book to book.I love Red and her feistyness. Trace is such typical guy. The kids are all great. I don't care too much for Davis though. The whole time I kept wondering what he was going to do and why. He just seemed so shifty, and he proved me right. I was so upset by the way he tricked everyone and played with their emotions and lives. I feel that he got what was coming to him after Red and Aponi left him.The scene of the birth was both intriguing and terrifying. I was so scared that something horrible was going to happen. After the birth we get to see a sharp change in both Red and Trace. I liked that Angela Scott made both parents feel so lost and yet determined. At no point did the pregnancy and birth seem easy or unreal, to me at least.Adding and subtracting characters can be tricky in a series, but Angela Scott handled it well. With the dangers encountered everyday for the group it makes sense that they would lose people. Adding people added danger and kept the story moving. I was upset by the deaths, but enjoyed the new girl. She is so much like Red.Once everyone was back together it was nice to see them enjoy something for a while, even though it was just a water fall and then a journey. I was so glad they found a homestead in the end. You must read the epilogue, it will make you smile."}, {"userName": "H.J.

This time Red is heavily pregnant and they are searching for a place to call home. But there is nowhere safe, nothing is permanent and death is everywhere.I have followed Red through her journeys, from the first time she met Trace, their growing relationship and dysfunctional family that they seem to collect everywhere they go. As with the other books, Angela Scott paints a very vivid picture. The constant presence of zombies, forever in the background and of course occasionally right in the middle of the fray. The tension builds up nicely though I was more than half way through when they were thrown into some real action. At times the pace was a little slow but, wow can the author bring you to your knees. She isn\u2019t afraid to hurt the characters, pulling at the heart strings. I don\u2019t want to give things away but what he wanted to do to Jack or was it Ace when he first saw him and let\u2019s not get started on Davis. The last quarter never stopped, it kept you wanted to read on, needing to know what was going to happen. Her writing as always is good, and I can\u2019t fault the editing. I really did enjoy this series, if a little slow in places, but maybe I like a good beheading more than most."}, {"userName": "Meganm922", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327196-meganm922", "userReview": "Review originally published at Love Literature Art and Reason book review blog.Dead Plains was awesome. It was bleak, horrifying, gory, full of drama, and a little bit of romance, too. As far as zombie horror goes, Angela Scott really knows what she\u2019s doing. Her series has the romance and humanity that I prefer in most of my novels, while other zombie novels skip right over that, but her novels do not lag with drama like other zombie stories, The Walking Dead television show being the best example. I was shocked by some of the events in the book, but I feel like I can\u2019t really give any details away without ruining some of the events of books one and two. Red and Trace\u2019s story got even more interesting as Dead Plains went on.I highly recommend the series. The Zombie West series is a horrifying, witty, adventurous, and dramatic story of survival in the Wild West plagued by the zombie apocalypse."}, {"userName": "Laura Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7491783-laura-thomas", "userReview": "The end is here. I\u2019m not talking about the apocalypse. I\u2019m talking about this fantastic series.There\u2019s not much I can tell you without spoiling it. You\u2019ll be weaving through the undead as the author wraps up individual stories.Get ready for it. You\u2019ll not get everything you hoped for. After seeing and sharing so much together, the group will have some casualties and not just life and death ones.That\u2019s where the author shines. Having characters act as they do makes this final book so emotional. There\u2019s no nice, neat conclusion. Some scenes are hard to take. I actually cried a couple of times, that\u2019s how difficult some scenes were. But, there are also some scenes that put a smile back on my face.As with the first two books, the author wrings it out of you, giving and taking right to the end.Even her ending is emotional and I was sad to read the last words. I didn\u2019t want to let go.I received this book for my honest and unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Carlie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12016624-carlie", "userReview": "This final book was a chore to read. The first two I breezed through in a day, this one I wanted to throw against a wall several times. Trace\u2019s character shifts into a lunatic stage totally opposite what I had come to admire. And then, as I am trying not to hate him so much, Red takes a shift and it is like wtf? When a story starts to bug me I have a tendency to want to pick it apart and this story had a lot of loose ends that were not tied up. One in particular was the turning of the heroine to a zombie and back again. After all she is the star and can do what no other can, right? That along with the fake killing of her child had me rolling my eyes. I put this book down several times before trudging on to finish it, not caring about them but wanting to know what happens to the others and it was a happy ever after but it only focused on Red and Trace with a brief comment thrown in about the others.I am glad this is the last in the series, I won\u2019t read another."}, {"userName": "Tamara! aka Amy G.

Heartbreak, betrayal, love, fear, anguish, meeting new friends and saying goodbye to old ones, all against a backdrop of undead attacks and worse, attacks from the living. Angela Scott does a nice job of showing peoples facets when faced with extreme situations. Just what would be your breaking point? Me, I'm just happy to live in an age of indoor plumbing. I enjoyed reading this series very much, even if it did give me a few shivers and made me jump at something that went 'bump' in the night. Turns out that was just my pets all deciding to join me in my read-a-thon at the same time. They have good timing like that hehe. Refreshing reading, this series. I'm looking forward to more.

It's been quite an adventure alongside Red, Trace, and the rest of the gang.
