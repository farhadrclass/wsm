Jamie is an avid reviewer on Goodreads and Instagram and we both read super fast and have very similar taste in books, though we don\u2019t always agree \ud83d\ude1cBoardwalk Summer is the first of our many planned buddy reads where I\u2019ll be sharing my thoughts as usual but you\u2019ll get the added bonus of hearing what Jamie thought as well. Hope you guys enjoy this and say hi to Jamie on Instagram if you don\u2019t already know her!Do you ever start a book and know pretty quickly that it\u2019ll be one that you\u2019ll love? Maybe it\u2019s the authors writing style or maybe it\u2019s the subject matter or you connect immediately with a character, or maybe it\u2019s a little bit of everything. When this does happen it\u2019s kind of magical and I had the good fortune to have that experience when I read just two chapters of this beauty!This flips between Violet in 1940 and Mari in 2007 and goes back and forth every chapter. I was quickly invested in Violet\u2019s story, not only because her personal plot line was fascinating but also because nothing draws me in faster from a historical perspective than old school Hollywood glamour, I swear I swoon. Mari was the type of character that I easily liked, she\u2019s a strong single mother who\u2019s proud of her family heritage with a side of spicy spitfire and a loving but tough mama bear as well. I did guess a few things very early on but then Jaeger totally caught me off guard with a surprising plot turn that I totally never saw coming but loved all the same.This was very well written and well researched, Jaeger brought the city of Santa Cruz to life both in the past and the recent present, it sounds like such a charming town and one I\u2019m longing to visit now. She also has a social conscience that is evident and I appreciated the issues she explored. The history, culture and idyllic sounding boardwalk itself all blended together to create the type of setting that truly transports the reader. There was way more of a mysterious aspect to the story than I had anticipated and there was also some sweet romance too. Both lead characters were strong, fearless women and were well developed, I really cared about both of them in the end and was sad to turn the final page.Boardwalk Summer in three words: Mesmerizing, Fascinating and Gorgeous."}, {"userName": "Elise Hooper", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17564400-elise-hooper", "userReview": "Meredith Jaeger creates a compelling story that channels both the glamour and big dreams of old Hollywood with the charm and thrills of Santa Cruz\u2019s boardwalk as two daring women risk everything to find love.

Kudos to Meredith Jaegar for writing such a captivating, intriguing, riveting, mesmerizing, and romantic story. The author is an amazing storyteller and her detailed vivid descriptions of two timelines in history is memorable. There are layers in this story, and like a puzzle, when you put the pieces together, you get a stunning , surprising, and heartwarming conclusion. The genres for this novel are Fiction, Women\u2019s Fiction, Historical Fiction, Romance and Suspense and some mystery. There are two timelines, one in 1940 and one in 2007. Both take place in Santa Cruz and other places.In 1940, the dream of the young ladies is to win a beauty contest and be Miss California. Hopefully this will take the winner to Hollywood. Violet Harcourt is crowned the winner, and her friend is runner-up. The problem is Violet has entered the competition as a single lady but really is a married woman. Her husband Charles is very angry that she has done this, and Violet returns the crown, and resigns. No one realizes what Violet\u2019s marriage is like. Violet does get to escape to Hollywood to find that all is not as it seems. Charles is furious finds and takes Violet home. Violet can\u2019t see her friends from the Boardwalk.In the summer of 2007, single Mom Marisol Cruz lives in a charming seaside cottage with her young daughter and parents. They inherited this cottage from Marisol\u2019s grandfather who was a great entertainer on the boardwalk years ago. Marisol works in a diner part-time. Marisol is fascinated by the town\u2019s history and the quaint gazebo where her grandparents had once danced. She sells raffle tickets, and helps during the celebration. The town is informed that the gazebo is going to be taken down, and condos will be built. This angers Marisol and the other residents.While Marisol is going through papers, she discovers that her grandfather was once friends with Violet Harcourt. Marisol looks up the history and discovers the Violet Harcourt had committed suicide as a young woman. She also finds that a key in her grandfather\u2019s belongs. Now she is intrigued.What can this all mean? Will Marisol find a way to stop the town from building the condominium?I appreciate that the author discusses important topics such as spousal abuse, unequal and threatening treatment of all minorities, the importance of family, friends, support, love and hope. There are some Kleenex moments, and I keep thinking about how amazing this story is. I highly recommend this story for readers that enjoy different genres, some suspense, intrigue, and romance. Happy Reading!"}, {"userName": "Jamie Rosenblit", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2364302-jamie-rosenblit", "userReview": "4.5 Magical Flying Unicorn Stars!I am so glad this is what my friend Amy (novelgossip) and I chose for our first buddy read together as #ninjatwins!

In Boardwalk Summer, the two timelines focus first on Violet Harcourt, a beautiful women stuck in an abusive marriage in 1940 and Mari Cruz, a single mother trying to fight for the right to preserve historical aspects of her Santa Cruz community in 2007. The way these stories coincide and connect will both surprise you and make you want to know more.

Told from dual narratives- Violet in 1940 and Mari in 2006- Jaeger reveals a story of strength and determination. Marisol is a single mom from a family of Mexican descent. Violet married into a wealthy gilded cage. Taking place in beautiful Santa Cruz, how one beauty pageant winner with stars in her eyes is connected to a family focused, caring historian is an amazing story that will keep you attached to this book until the very last page. Boardwalk Summer is the perfect summer read and looks to be one of my favorites of the year.

I enjoyed both stories and loved the way that the author ended the novel.Marisol is a single mother living with her parents in Santa Cruz. As she is trying to find more about the history of her town for the historical society, she finds a picture of a woman who was trying to become an actress in 1940 but jumped to her death. There is a mystery behind Violet's death and when Marisol finds out that her beloved grandfather was somehow connected, she works to find out the real story about Violet, a Miss California, married to a controlling man who tried to escape her life in Hollywood but ended up as a suicide in Santa Cruz. This is a wonderful beach read. It has a little mystery, a bit of romance and two women who are trying to make life better for themselves and in Marisol's story, trying to make life better for her community.

I did not realize until after I finished the book that its author also wrote \u201cThe Dressmaker\u2019s Dowry\u201d which I really enjoyed. The story alternates between Violet Harcourt in the 1940s and Marisol (Mari) Cruz in 2007. Violet Harcourt was a beautiful California girl who dreamed of making it big in Hollywood. Although married at the time to an abusive, controlling husband, she entered a local beauty pageant in her hometown of Santa Cruz and won. This was her ticket to Hollywood. Violet found that the glittering world of Hollywood didn\u2019t meet her expectations. So she made a shocking choice that left people to wonder why this beauty queen died so young.Then in 2007 single mother Mari, while researching the history of Santa Cruz, also her hometown, comes across the story of Violet\u2019s death. She discovers that her grandfather Ricardo Cruz, once a famous Boardwalk performer, had a connection to Violet. So, of course, she had to find out what their connection was.Everyone is keeping secrets \u2013 Violet, Mari, Mari\u2019s grandfather. Why? Who were they protecting? And who will be harmed when the secrets are revealed? This story of tragedy and courage kept me captivated. The characters were endearing \u2013 well, most of them. While there are moments of heartbreak, there are also moments of joy. Betrayal overcome by the bond of friendship. Cowardice excelled by love. It is a beautiful story that will linger with you like water lapping at your toes as the tide comes in.I received an advance e-galley from Edelweiss and HarperCollins, the opinions are my own."}, {"userName": "r3ad3rsan0nym0us", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28374194-r3ad3rsan0nym0us", "userReview": "I received a free copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own. Sometimes I'm afraid to pick up a book by an author after reading their first book and enjoying it. The Dressmaker's Dowry was a great historical fiction read told in alternating POVs from in past and present. Boardwalk Summer follows a similar style, but of course I wondered how the life of Violet Hastings (1940), a beautiful young woman with aspirations to make it big in Hollywood despite being married to a very controlling and manipulative husband., would intersect with the life of single mom Marisol Cruz (2007), living with her 4 year old daughter with her parents after her dreams of being a historian seemingly have faded into the background as she's a full-time mother.
