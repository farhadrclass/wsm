The immature lick it clean and throw the rest away; adults scrape off the top and eat it dry.\u201d Janis Thomas, an American author has crafted an incredibly delicious tale about a mid-aged woman who's life turns upside down when her husband of eighteen years, in her new book,  Sweet Nothings. Yeah that woman's life terribly goes wrong after her husband leaves her, but she makes it up by changing herself and the approach of facing her problem- now, that's what we call bravery!I'd love to thank the author, Janis Thomas, for giving me this opportunity to read and review her novel. Ruby is a 43-year old woman with two kids- a 16-year old daughter and a 14-year old son, and also she runs a bakery of her own. One fine morning, Ruby's husband, Walter, leaves her for another 40-year old woman from his office, named Cheryl. Feeling devastated, Ruby, moves on with her life and to support her two children, she takes up a job as a baking instructor, and also gets a complete makeover. Eventually she develops a crush on her family mortgage broker named Jacob Salt, who according to her was the Baked Alaska in her already des-serted life. But Ruby never had a crush on anybody else even when she met her husband, or never had any idea how to flirt with another man apart from her husband, or neither had the slightest idea of how to \"kiss\" someone else abruptly and impulsively. With all these overwhelming feelings, Ruby is once again discovering her new-found freedom and her blissful period of \"being single again\". PS: The author have forgotten to make a note to her readers that this book is way too sweet, I mean literally, that you need to keep your \"blood sugar\" in check, before reading this book! Well, this book is that kind which you are going to cherish over a hot mug of coffee with a plate of deep, dark chocolate brownie on a very gloomy day. And with all those Ruby's stressipies, you're bound to become a 'sweet-tooth', and the book is so delicious that it is hard to forget the taste for a very long time. From the very first chapter, I kind of got addicted to Ruby and her quirkiness and on her use of Depends when she is shit-scared and her stressipies whenever she is stressed or feeling over-joy or excited or whatever, and also her style of baking. I even liked her bff, Izzy, who is a fantastic combination of funny and scary both at the same time. Ruby's daughter, Colleen is going through her sweet-sixteen and fortunately, she is the perfect daughter with all those girly manners and her obsession of catching the 7-hours beauty sleep every day. Ruby's son, Kevin is a surfer and is full of wisdom. According to Ruby, I think, Jacob Salt is some-kind of Greek God, that once looking at Jacob, Ruby couldn't stop drooling. And her bakery shop and her baking beautiful recipes add the cherry on the top for a perfect fairytale ending, although, spoiler alert, the end got bit rough and messy! Hats off to the author, Janis Thomas, has taken us behind the glittery and fancy world of the popular reality TV series, Cake Off! so vividly and at some times, I found myself standing right in the middle of the chaos of the perfect glittery TV show. The author's style of writing this novel is really great, I mean, I can feel Ruby's emotions to smell her delicious cakes to hear my heart-beat faster when Ruby steals a glance on her hot student. Cake-lovers, beware, you might just hear your stomachs growling with too much cake!!"}, {"userName": "Julie Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15137376-julie-valerie", "userReview": "I adore Janis Thomas\u2019s style of writing. Her writing is so comfortable it\u2019s easy to get lost in the pages of her books and I intend to follow this writer throughout her writing career. SWEET NOTHINGS is Janis\u2019s second book. I loved her d\u00e9but novel, SOMETHING NEW, which I thought was written specifically for me \u2013 tells the story of a woman who starts blogging and blogs through the questions in her life. Wonderful book.In SWEET NOTHINGS, Ruby McMillian, our main character (oh my gosh, she\u2019s great) is trying to conquer the baking of a white-chocolate souffle with raspberry Grand Marnier sauce on the opening pages of the book, but her souffle falls flat upon news of her husband\u2019s infidelity and his resulting departure from their marriage of 18 years. Ruby\u2019s response to his \u201cannouncement\u201d which is more of a proclamation is hysterical and so authentic, readers will immediately relate to Ruby and align their loyalties with her throughout the book. Ruby has two teenage children: Kevin, a mellow surfer, and Colleen, a dramatic 16-year-old. She also owns the Muffin Top bakery which serves as both a place of respite and anxiety at different times and for different reasons.With an especially charming narrative in which Ruby assigns desserts to the personality types of people in her life (Walter is shortbread, Kevin a white-chocolate-macadamia-nut cookie, Colleen a seven-layer-dream bar), readers will enjoy passages of Ruby losing herself in her baking. Here\u2019s an excerpt from 105:\u201c\u2026I love this moment in the process of cake creation, the point at which the object I am trying to simulate comes into focus out of sugar and chocolate. The rest of the world falls away. There are no errant husbands or threats of foreclosure, no children in their precarious teens, no gossiping housewives, no bad economy or terrorist plots. Only me, my hands, my tools, and the cake.\u201dWhile Ruby copes with life and sees everything through the lens of her baking, central to the storyline is the departure of her husband, Walter, with a woman named Cheryl from accounting. Every time Cheryl appears in story, her name is italicized because Ruby struggles a great deal with Walter\u2019s choice in women. Cheryl isn\u2019t a twenty-something bombshell, the stereotypical woman you\u2019d expect your husband to runaway with. Worse. She\u2019s just like Ruby in age, physique and station in life with one exception: Cheryl takes care of herself whereas Ruby has let herself go. Ouch. This almost implies that Walter was not running to a younger, prettier woman, but running from the woman at his side who has let herself go. Cheryl fulfills Walter not because she provides youth and perky boobs but because she provides something far more threatening: Walter believes Cheryl is his soul mate. Early in the book, from page 62 comes the following insights:\u201c\u2026I have always thought that one plus one makes two, whereas Walter believes that the \u201cright one\u201d plus the \u201cright one\u201d equals one squared. One to the infinite power of love. He actually said that to me on our wedding day, and I laughed at him as though it were the funniest joke in th world. And I remember the hurt in his eyes, which I pretended not to see as I flagged down one of the servers for another glass of champagne\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026His leaving, I understand now, was inevitable. Because he believes in soul mates, and I don\u2019t. He believes in true love and I believe in recipes. And now he has found his soul mate, his true love. Cheryl. And I am left in ruins\u2026\u201dLeft in ruins is right. Ruby\u2019s business, her mortgage, her children\u2019s wellbeing, her reputation in the community, everything is shaken. Readers will love the cast of characters that surround Ruby on her road to rebuilding her life: Izzy, Jacob Salt, her children, her mother. And readers will love the journey that takes Ruby out of her comfort zone and into circumstances that are frightening to Ruby but captivating to readers. I won\u2019t mention them here for fear of placing spoilers into this book review. To find out what happens to Ruby, you\u2019ll have to read Sweet Nothings by Janis Thomas.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.\u2018So, too, have I gathered the ingredients of my life and carefully flavored them, patiently beat my whites, and lovingly folded together all the elements of my existence. Put my proverbial batter into the appropriately prepared ramekin and gently placed my world into the oven. And yet I must have done something wrong, made some false move or ignored an important step in the recipe, because my life has suddenly collapsed around me into a charred, inedible ruin.\u2019Ruby McMillan\u2019s husband announces one day that he\u2019s leaving her for another woman. Their marriage had been slowly dissolving for the past years so it\u2019s not as devastating emotionally, but she\u2019s left scrambling for a hold on life while managing her failing bakery and trying to figure out how to inform her children that their father has left them. Things start looking up when Ruby moves her husbands stuff out of the house, gets a makeover and decides to take a chance on the unexpected by signing up to teach a cake class. She also meets Jacob Salt, a man that makes her feel something she hasn\u2019t in years.This was such a fun and light-hearted read despite the serious nature of the topic. It could have easily been a sob story about trust being shattered and hearts being broken but I found myself laughing out loud at times and reading with a smile on my face. It was so refreshing to read a book about a heroine that is faced with a devastating loss but is able to overcome it all while still maintaining her sense of humor. Ruby\u2019s character was fantastically written and was quite the inspiration.Obviously, my favorite aspect of this book is the foodie bits. I\u2019ll read the occasional chick lit of course but foodie books? Anytime. Ruby is a baker and ends up being a teacher of a cooking class so we\u2019re given all kinds of fabulous baking details that made me want to hop up and bake some muffins (because I couldn\u2019t bake half of the amazing things Ruby could so I had to settle for muffins.) Not only were the details absorbing but she was constantly coming up with new recipes as a sort of coping mechanism. Every time she\u2019d get overwhelmed or stressed about something, her creative subconscious would come up with something amazing sounding to try.\u2018Homemade marshmallow cream and roasted almonds sandwiched between bite-size graham-cracker squares, enrobed with Callebaut milk choolate.\u2019Mmmm..I pretty much loved everything about this book and I read it during a time where I needed to be reminded that despite hardships in life it\u2019s possible to remain strong and power through. It was the perfect book for my current mood and Ruby delivered the emotional boost I needed. This is my first book read by this author but I\u2019ll definitely be picking up her other works. Highly suggested for those looking for a fun and entertaining (and inspirational) chick-lit type read."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110328-melissa", "userReview": "Such a delightful story!

Ruby is stunned, humiliated and outraged. Not only does Walter abruptly tell her he's unhappy when she thought they were doing fine (though to be honest, she admits she never really thinks about it much), but he doesn't even tell his two children, sixteen year old Colleen and fourteen year old Kevin, leaving Ruby to handle the whole thing. But the worst thing about it, as far as Ruby can tell at this early stage, is that he's not even leaving her for a much younger, prettier woman with perky boobs. No, Walter is leaving her for Cheryl, a work colleague who's also in her forties. Yet, worse is to come. Ruby can handle the fact that all the women she knows in the small town community of Pelican Point, California, are now snubbing her - because while Walter dumped her on Facebook, everyone else is reading his messages of finding new love on board Cheryl's yacht - and the financial woes of her cake shop are nothing new. But when she meets her new mortgage broker, handsome divorc\u00e9 Jacob Salt, she learns that Walter hadn't paid the mortgage on the house, that he's planning to declare bankruptcy, and that the house is scheduled for foreclose, making her and her children homeless.Ruby has a couple of options remaining: she can fall apart and let life unfold as it will, or she can put up a fight and climb her way out of this mess. She has an inheritance tucked away that she had planned on surprising Walter with one day, with a trip to some exotic locale, but now she dips into it to save her house and give herself a few months' breathing room. Her business partner and best friend, Izzy, has a couple of money making ideas that could save the bakery, including taking on a cooking class for the local community college and even going on the TV show Cake-Off! where top cake decorators have eight hours to assemble and decorate huge fancy cakes. Ruby at first baulks at both ideas, due to the simple fact that she is rendered useless by a spotlight - useless and incontinent. But they start small and the cooking class goes well.And Jacob Salt, who seemed to stiff and formal at first but who gradually unwinds as Ruby gets to know him better, seems to have her corner, ensuring that she is the one who will make the big fancy cake for his company's 50th anniversary celebration. More than that, Jacob does things to Ruby that she's never experienced before. She's always been calmly rational, pragmatic, practical, the kind of woman who wanted a simple, safe life, no fireworks, had never felt regret at not getting into the kind of passionate, explosive and ultimately doomed relationships that her friends had. Her time apart from Walter and her growing feelings for Jacob give her the time and clues she needs to really examine the life she's led, the decisions she's made, and in the end give her both the strength and the self-awareness to make one very important decision.Sweet Nothings was a real pleasure to read. It's chick-lit, but not as humorous as the British kind; it was also a surprise for having some steamy kisses and a sex-scene, which you don't normally get in chick-lit. But this is the story of Ruby's belated coming-of-age, a heady, messy time of figuring herself out, keeping her family (her and her kids) together and saving her business without compromising her sense of integrity. A detailed sex scene gives you that deeper window into a character's psyche, which makes Ruby someone you really get to know and understand, sympathise with and care for, much more so than I would normally feel about a chick-lit heroine.I loved the focus on food. Each chapter bears a food-related title, connected to what's going to happen next, and Ruby has this rather fun habit of thinking of people in terms of dessert. Walter \"always seemed like shortbread to me. A simple cookie. A reliable cookie. Ordinary yet hardy. Made from three universally loved ingredients. The kind of cookie you can bring to any occasion and everyone will eat one and like it, although they probably won't remark upon it later, because it's not a triple fudge brownie. I realize this comparison might sound unflattering, but honestly, I love shortbread.\" [p.13] And really, her descriptions - the way she breaks the food down to its base elements, the way she connects the different layers or parts or texture of a food to a person's character - it really is quite ingenious and hugely entertaining. I've always loved making cakes. And biscuits and slices. I still have just as many flops as I have successes, but I love the process of making something, and the satisfying feeling of producing something. It's a feeling that's sorely lacking in our world and society these days, with our stationary desk jobs and our paper-pushing, sign-here, file-this jobs. No wonder we get so depressed, by and large. And angry. But make something, from scratch, now there's a good feeling. I loved the descriptions of Ruby's food, her food experiments (which she calls \"stressipes\" as she comes up with unusual ingredient combinations when under stress, many of which don't work out), and her cake decorating. And having the story end with a Cake-Off! episode, that was a brilliant ending. Cake-Off!, which airs on the Food Network in the book, is modelled on \nThe Ultimate Cake Off\n, a TV show that airs on TLC (a channel I always thought stood for \"tender loving care\" - especially as they show those kinds of heartfelt, weepy reality TV show - but which actually stands for \"The Learning Channel\", of all things!). I have actually watched a few episodes of this show - in general I absolutely hate the prevalence of food/cooking competition \"reality\" TV shows that are pretty much the only food-related programming on these days - you don't learn a thing about how to cook, the only thing you learn, consciously or sub-consciously, is that cooking is really stressful and people are just going to criticise you no matter what you make or how much effort you put into it. The Ultimate Cake Off is much as it's described in the book: teams of people who in real life run small businesses of cake decorating etc., have 9 hours to assemble and decorate massive cakes for special occasions. The time limit, the judges and the cameras clamouring for drama and disaster make for one very stressful competition, but what makes me watch it is my fascination for seeing what they create, and my interest in how they make it. Not that you learn all that much, but still.Thomas doesn't take any short-cuts with her story of Ruby: Ruby is a very real woman who feels very human and who you really come to care about. The way events play out had good flow, and only a few minor things felt a bit contrived, or a bit too silly. I have trouble understanding why people would shun a woman whose husband had left her - that I don't get, and I don't know how realistic it is. I also struggle with the concept of calling someone who makes cakes for a living, a \"baker\". To me, a baker is someone who makes bread. They get up every day at 4 and bake loaves of bread and other yummy things, then crawl back into bed for some sleep until they have to get up and do it all over again. And a bakery is a shop that sells, primarily, bread. If a shop doesn't sell bread, it's a cake shop, or a cafe, or a patisserie (to use the \"correct\" French word). I've seen professional cake makers called Confectionary Chef or pastry chef or even just cake decorator. I'm not saying it's incorrect to call someone who makes cakes a baker, it just doesn't sound correct to me because of how I learned the word \"baker\". Just one of those things.This is a simple story about a simple woman trying to sort her life out, rediscover herself and her own long-dormant passions, and follow her slowly-waking heart; but like all such stories, it is deceptively simple because it's such a human story, familiar not for the situation as such but because it's about love, life, the home, family and making things work, the struggle to overcome obstacles and difficulties, and all these themes are ones we live with every day. Accompanying Ruby on her own personal journey through all this was both touching and entertaining, and a fair reminder that it's never too late for love, or for following your dreams - and excelling at them.My thanks to the publisher for a copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5401033-marlene", "userReview": "What do you do when your husband of 18 years tells you that he\u2019s leaving you for another woman?

But, when the going gets tough, Ruby McMillan gets baking!Ruby is the owner of the Muffin Top bakery. It\u2019s a small, cozy bakery located in Downtown Pelican Point. Ever since Ruby was little, she knew she wanted to open up her own bakery. Even at a young age she had everything picked out for her future bakery \u2026 right down to the plum colored napkins. The only thing she didn\u2019t anticipate was for her sales to start flagging. But Ruby can\u2019t focus on that now. She\u2019s still trying to figure out how she\u2019s going to raise her two children alone, pay her mortgage and keep her bakery from going under. Not to mention she has become a pariah of sorts in her community.

Thankfully Ruby has the bakery to keep her mind off of the drama that has suddenly consumed her life. She agrees to teach a baking class to increase her diminishing funds, while also hesitantly allowing her daughter to give her a confidence boosting make-over.

More like sweet everythings! When I read the summary for Sweet Nothings and saw that it was about a baker whose husband leaves her, I was excited. Baking in a book? Yes please!Ruby McMillian thought she was living the perfect, quaint life. She has a stable husband, two kids, and a bakery where she gets to do what she loves all day long. Sure, there's no real passion with her husband, but who needs that? Well, apparently he does. One morning, Ruby's husband tells her he's leaving her because he's found his \"soul mate,\" Cheryl who works in the same office as him. Leaving Ruby with no money in their joint account, a mortgage that he hasn't paid, and two confused kids, her husband sets off on his \"adventure of a lifetime\" with his new soul mate. After a brief breakdown, Ruby manages to pick herself back up and try to solve her problems. But with everything she's left with, the bakery is in jeopardy. Soon Ruby finds herself taking on the job as a baking instructor, letting her daughter give her a complete makeover, and flirting with the gorgeous mortgage broker Jacob Salt. Ruby finds herself discovering a life she never thought could happen. Like I said, this book was just so sweet. I loved Ruby, especially considering she had to deal with a lot of crap thrown her way in a small amount of time. Sometimes, characters can appear whiney about their lives and do nothing but complain. Thankfully, Ruby let's herself have the acceptable breakdown, but then she picks herself up and truly tries to make things work. And I love how her husband leaving her makes her realize things about her life she hadn't really notice before until he was gone. Not to mention her sarcastic attitude makes this a very entertaining read. I also really liked how Jacob Salt was introduced into the picture. Ruby didn't immediately go out and find herself a new man. In fact, she did everything in her power to try to ignore the attraction she felt for Jacob when they met because she felt like it was too soon after being dumped by the man she was married to for 18 years. So while the romance was definitely there, it was tastefully interjected into the story. Not only were Ruby and Jacob perfect, but the other characters all had their special little place in the story. Ruby's kids were great and each added a little more to the story, whether it was her son's typical teenager comments or her daughter's fashion advice, they were integral in Ruby's story. Also, Ruby's coworkers were so quirky and were all absolutely perfect for the bakery. All of the characters were unique in their own way, which gave the story a whole lot more to like aside from the main character. In the end, I really enjoyed Sweet Nothings. I loved how Ruby assigned a dessert to match the personality of everyone she met, and how she would come up with \"stressipes\" whenever she was in a particularly stressful situation. Mmmm all I wanted to do is find myself a big chocolate chip cookies to munch on while I was reading this one.

You can find it, and many more reviews at the blog.3.75 starsSweet Nothings is a hilarious and poignant look inside the life of a woman whose husband of almost two decades leaves her unexpectedly, sending her entire world into a tailspin. Ruby is nothing if not reliable and practical. She\u2019s passionate about her job as a baker, but the passion stops there. She\u2019s a great mother and she thought she was a good wife, but when her husband leaves her for another woman, she realizes she was never truly happy with her life.I really liked Ruby. She\u2019s got a strong voice, and her thoughts are very candid which I loved (for the most part). I felt like I really got inside her head and got to know her - what drives her, what\u2019s important to her, what she wants in life for herself and her family. Her life was sort of like a comedy of errors; things would be going along great and then BAM disaster strikes and she\u2019s left to pick up the pieces. She\u2019s strong and resilient, and I admired her as a woman, a mother, a friend, and a businessperson.Sweet Nothings starts out strong - I was completely engrossed from the first page - and it carries on strong until about the middle when it starts to lag a bit. It feels strange saying this since I\u2019m a total romance junkie, but it was the romance in the story that fell flat for me. I didn\u2019t like how aware Ruby was of Jacob every second he was around, and she talked incessantly about her vagina\u2019s reaction to him, which I really could have done without. It was funny at first but got to be tiresome pretty quickly. I was actually ready to set the book aside and not finish it because I couldn\u2019t imagine how it could possibly carry on for another 100+ pages, but I fought through, and I\u2019m glad I did. It returned to the style I loved in the beginning of the book, and finished strong.Ruby\u2019s not the only great character in this book. I really liked her children -they\u2019re believable, and I loved the relationship Ruby has with them. It\u2019s not perfect and it\u2019s definitely not all smooth sailing, but it\u2019s realistic, and I enjoyed that. I liked Ruby\u2019s best friend and business partner, Izzy, and I liked a few of the other minor characters, Shane in particular. The love interest, Jacob, is a real conundrum - in some ways he\u2019s good for Ruby, and in other ways I wondered what she saw in him. I found it hard to get invested in their relationship, even though they have moments I really enjoyed.Overall, it was a joy watching Ruby grow throughout Sweet Nothings. She learns so much about herself and life in general, proving that you\u2019re never too old to grow and change, even when things seem insurmountable or when it feels like you\u2019re too old to lead a different life from the one you\u2019ve always led. Funny, touching, and genuine, Sweet Nothings is a must-read for fans of women\u2019s fiction."}, {"userName": "Miriam Downey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5196292-miriam-downey", "userReview": "Read my full review here: http://mimi-cyberlibrarian.blogspot.c... The title says it all--\"Sweet Nothings.\" It is a trifle, a cupcake of a novel. It can be read in a couple of sittings, much like a cookie can be eaten in a couple of bites. But like a cookie, or a cake, you just gotta have a book like Sweet Nothings occasionally. Janis Thomas, the author, calls her books \"Chick lit grows up\" by which she means matrimonial suburbia, where the mundane aspects of life take over.Sweet Nothings is a book about resilience. Ruby is the owner of a sweets bakery called Muffin Tops. In the opening chapters of the book her husband leaves her and their two children for another woman--not a sweet young thing, but a woman of his own age. This is almost a bigger insult than if he had left Ruby for a 20-something hottie. Ruby pulls herself together in short order with panache and great humor. She has a very rye way of looking at the world, but she is nothing but honest with herself, her children, and her world. She figures out a way to make her bakery profitable so that she can support her family. Ruby is a very likeable character, and her journey to a new life is inspiring. The closing lines of the book share her journey: \"It's never too late to dream. It's never too late to believe.\"The beauty of Sweet Nothings is that the serious topic of a woman left in the lurch could have been told with pain and suffering, but instead it is told with humor.There's a lot of baking in this book which adds to its enjoyment. Although there is very little remarkable about Sweet Nothings, it was a perfect book to read the week before our huge family descended on us for Christmas. Thank goodness for that, because there was no way that I could have read a heavy book as I was doing my own cooking and baking before the holidays. It actually may be the reason that I baked more than I usually do. Ruby's efforts inspired me. My children and grandchildren should thank her.Ruby reminded me a little of Diane Mott Davidson's character Goldy, and although there is no mystery involved in Sweet Nothings, the feistiness and humor are similar. I also remembered a friend whose husband left her for another middle-aged woman. She came to work one day with a picture of her ex with the new woman, who looked older and chubbier than my friend. The first thing out of my mouth was \"He left you for her!\" My friend told me that was the best thing that anyone said about the divorce. Ruby had some of those same emotions. All jilted women should be so strong.Janis Thomas' website: http://www.janisthomas.com"}, {"userName": "Margo Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1848451-margo-kelly", "userReview": "If you like chick-lit, then this book is for you! My friends tell me all the time that they love to read light, fun, happy books, because life has enough troubling things in it and they don't want to read unhappy things. So ... I thought I'd step out of my preferred horror genre and try a chick-lit book. Well ... I think I should stick with horror ... and YA (I do love most YA books!).Why? Because while my friends might like to read about happy topics for an escape, I actually like to read things that are worse than my own life to make me appreciate how good I have it. (TMI?)The worse thing that happens in SWEET NOTHINGS is a cake gets ruined. ;) It is a cute book, and the beginning is wonderful. I'm trying to award stars based on an objective point-of-view instead of my \"Give me a break, it's only a cake!\" attitude. Here are the reasons I gave it less than five stars:1. The writing is great, but the author overuses italics (personal pet peeve).2. The word VAGINA is used a lot. I'm not opposed to the word. I just got tired of reading about the main character's vagina. 3. The kids were dumbed-down. Since I read a lot of YA, I expect teenage characters to be pretty sharp. And the fact that they didn't see their dad's post on Facebook in the beginning before their mom told them about it surprised me. On the flip side of that, however, I was surprised that the teenage daughter knew how to not only cut her mother's hair on the spur of the moment, but also she layered it. Hmm. What teenage girl knows how to layer someone's hair? Basically, I had trouble believing the teenagers motivations, actions, and dialogue. I know they were only supporting characters, but these details distanced me from the story.With that said, I still think if you're a chick-lit fan, you'll love this book."}, {"userName": "Viviane Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682057-viviane-crystal", "userReview": "This is a fun story in spite of some of the quandaries that Ruby McMillan finds herself in, life-changing shockers that she is totally unprepared to handle. But Ruby is a feisty lady; so when her husband decides to leave for his \u201csoul mate\u201d from work, Ruby does her mourning with her two children. But she never wallows in the sadness, even though it\u2019s most definitely there! The next shocker is about the possibility of losing her home and her gourmet bakery due to lack of financial resources, again caused by her husband who has cut off all her money and won\u2019t pay a dime to support her or her children. Creep for sure! Ruby has good friends and is actually making a new friend in a mortgage broker, Jacob. This is greatly helped by the total makeover she gets first from her daughter which turns her from a frumpy Mom to a hot chick who catches many male looks for her great beauty which has so long been hidden. What\u2019s really been hidden is the sense of self-worth beyond just knowing she\u2019s a great baker! All it takes is a bit of encouragement, daring and allowing the naturally bright and beautiful woman to emerge! The journey is wonderful!Now her life is about to travel down many unforeseen roads to become a \u201cCake Lady\u201d teacher and perhaps even consider getting a TV show to teach and show her magnificent baking skills. Her husband? By the time he\u2019s gotten over his mid-life crisis or whatever it is, where will Ruby and Walter be? Quite a surprise, actually!Janis Thomas writes with a light style that is so pleasant to read and makes one flip the pages, with interest never once waning. There\u2019s a reading guide in the back of the book with very thoughtful, provocative questions for book clubs or just one\u2019s own private consideration.

OK, what's the saying for let the reader beware?This is not a clean romance. It's not a smutty, trashy romance novel, but it does contain one sex scene, which my innocent mind would not allow me to read, and a few cuss words here and there.This book reminded me of a cheesy Christmas movie. I guess that's appropriate with most of my reading having taken place during the Christmas season. This is not a Christmas story. I'm not saying that. It's like a cheesy Christmas romance movie where you roll your eyes and know what's going to happen next but you simply cannot look away until it's over.Ruby's husband, Walter, runs away from their life, their marriage, their house with a co-worker he deems his soul mate named Colleen. This leaves Ruby in quite the mess as she has to deal with her two teenage kids, the mortgage on the house which she finds has not been paid in some time, the fact that Walter has stripped their bank account bare, and her not so successful cake shop named The Muffin Top (you can probably guess now why the title is Sweet Nothings). The story revolves around Ruby putting her life back together and finding out who she is and what she wants out of a romance. I did say there is a sex scene so a guy shows up, obviously, but I'm not going to spoil anything else in case you do want to read this for yourself.I won this book in a giveaway at booktrib.com.

She has her initial meltdown, of course, but then she starts getting on with her life. Walter has left their finances in a shambles and Ruby has to scramble to hold everything together as he sails off into the sunset with his new lover. I had a blast reading this book. Even as I knew I should be feeling bad for Ruby, I would have to laugh as her neighbors kept her apprised of Walter's latest exploits via his Facebook poetry. Oh, it was bad. I wanted to slap his face just for the poetry! She tries her best, finds her new groove as a single woman, and has some encounters with some seriously steamy men. What's not to love? While I felt that Ruby moved on awfully fast, the author explains that by saying that Rational Ruby rationally chose Walter as her husband; she was never head-over-heels for him. It was still a little hard to buy. That aside, I enjoyed watching Ruby expand her limits and learn to believe in love.The one thing I felt was really missing from the book was a recipe section. Ruby is a fabulous baker and it's just not fair to describe all her mouth-watering creations without giving me a chance to try them for myself!If you're looking for a bit of escapism, Ruby and her kids and friends definitely fit the bill.

In the meantime, Ruby must raise her two teenagers and try and keep her bakery from going under.I loved Ruby, I loved her kids. The bakery and its staff and customers were some of the funniest laugh out loud moments.This is another one that I plucked from the languishing TBR stack. From the outside looking in, this has all the makings of a fluffy chick-lit novel. And, those fluffy aspects are certainly present, but also a surprising level of depth. Faced with a new reality at the age of 44, Ruby moves forward, one cake, cupcake and muffin at a time. The exploration of her branching out and beginning to live is what was surprising. As she comes to discover who she is, she also discovers a life worth living.There is moderate profanity and one moderately explicit non-marital sex scene.

I also enjoyed how she coped with the hand she was dealt \u2013 it was real and heart wrenching at times, but Ms. Thomas worked magic adding just the right amount of funny at the right times.
