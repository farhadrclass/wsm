I was excited to find this novel after having seen on Netflix the old Peter O'Toole \"Masada\" television drama [1981] which I had missed when shown on television originally. Both the original novel and its adaptation covered the siege of Masada and its shattering climax through the eyes of both the Roman and Jewish commanders, the titular \"antagonists.\" After a long introduction to the setting and characters, the story moves quickly and inexorably to the siege from both Roman and Jewish sides and its immediate aftermath. Not much is known factually, so most of the novel is fictionalized. The author even admitted as much.In spite of any differences in physical appearance of Flavius Silva, the Roman general and governor of Judaea between novel and teleplay, I couldn't visualize anyone but O'Toole as that figure. Eleazar ben Yair was presented as the stalwart military leader of the rebellious Jews, originally a fisherman, defending his people against Roman conquest, and trying to keep in balance the different Jewish sects with him but I felt the author was more sympathetic to Silva, whom he presented as a lonely middle-aged widower, only desirous of putting down this rebellion at Emperor Vespasian's orders, then dreaming of retiring to his villa near Rome, living in peace with his Jewish mistress. Even after 40-some years, this novel is still worthwhile reading."}, {"userName": "Kevin Turman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7224037-kevin-turman", "userReview": "Originally released as The Antagonists, Ernest K. Gann's fictional account of the battle for Masada. He creates an antagonist and protagonist who become more of the same person as the story progresses. Gann's speculation that General Lucius Flavius Silva's fall from grace was fueled by his sympathy for the Sicarii is intriguing. Silva's name and likeness were stricken from Roman history during the Damnatio memoriae or \"condemnation of memory\" Gann's follow up to Masada is The Triumph which brings General Silva back to Rome as a hero but he turns from Rome and Rome turns from him. I would suggest reading Masada and The Triumph together as two books of a single work. I would say that these two works are, to me, the greatest stories that I have had the pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3734253-rachel", "userReview": "I did NOT like this book at first. The author seemed heavy handed while establishing characters but then the plot took off and it got better. However I think most of what I liked was the story (which really wasn't the author's doing... the story was written 2000 years ago) as opposed to the writing. A better author could have written a much better book, but this one was okay. My problem with historical fiction is I always want to know where the research ends and the fiction begins. Maybe I'll read something more scholarly on the seige of Masada."}, {"userName": "Charles", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336573-charles", "userReview": "Definitely reads like true history.

I remember it as the mini-series with Peter O\u2019Toole when I was a kid. I didn\u2019t watch it because it seemed scary and serious. In other words, too adult! I didn\u2019t know it was also a novel until I happened to look for it a couple of years ago.Masada is a historical novel that is about the Roman siege of Masada, an isolated fortress in the middle of the desert in 73 AD. It was the site of the last stand of 900 Jews who, after the fall of Jerusalem, resisted the Romans for three years. When defeat was inevitable, they chose to kill themselves rather than submit to Roman slavery.I don\u2019t feel like this is so much a book about Masada as a book about its characters. In fact, the novel\u2019s original title was The Antagonists. Even then, however, the Roman general Flavius Silva dominates the character of Eleazar ben Yair, the leader of the Jewish rebels. He is just so much more compelling. He has a world weary sense of humor and a deep humanity. He is a Roman to the core though and I respected that. He never felt any sympathy for the Jewish cause, just a healthy respect for ben Yair and a sense of the absurdity of life and war. This is a realistic depiction of a Roman in those times. Silva is also a sad and lonely man and I felt a great deal of compassion for the character.I also never get over how organized, efficient and disciplined the Roman legions were. Even today, it\u2019s impressive to read about."}, {"userName": "Erik Graff", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff", "userReview": "I read this up at the Michigan cottage during the fall when one had to heat the living room with the wood-burning stove. I believe it may have been left up there by Dad's former wife, Lin. In any case, it is a fair reconstruction of the taking of the final Jewish stronghold during what they came to call the first Roman War--the one Josephus reported and participated in, albeit in Galilee. The characterizations are a bit too modern perhaps, but the material facts are held to well enough. The sympathies of the author are not entirely confined to the doomed Jewish defenders. In 1981 the book was made into a miniseries and reissued as Masada."}, {"userName": "John Reas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3772559-john-reas", "userReview": "Excellent and well written, this historical piece of fiction captures one of the momentous events that took place during rebellion in Judea during the reign of the emperor Vespasian, and how a people valiantly refused capitulation to their Roman conquerors."}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/819711-arlene", "userReview": "Several years ago we had the chance to visit Israel and of course one of our tours was to Masada.

Eleazar ben Yair & General Flavius Silva, the antagonists in that brief conflict when the Romans were pursuing the last remnants of resisting Jews, shared the common nobility of men who face impossible odds. Eleazar confronted the overwhelmingly superior military force of Rome; Silva, a sensitive, intelligent man, faced the subtler threat of spiritual & physical impotence. Then there is Sheva, a Jewish beauty determined to save her people Jael-fashion; the influential Roman Falco with his two pretty boys; noble Masadians & grousing Romans. It all ends with a Roman desert victory entailing their psychic defeat. Within its traditional frame, some convincing commotion & the publisher anticipates a strong commercial success.--Kirkus", "title": "Masada", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/990085.Masada", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1268528779l/990085.jpg", "reviews": 35, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19587.Ernest_K_Gann", "name": "Ernest K.
