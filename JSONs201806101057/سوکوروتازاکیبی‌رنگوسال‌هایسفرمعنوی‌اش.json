I didn\u2019t particularly want to answer the phone as it was likely to be a telemarketer, but it could be someone phoning about possible work.\u201cSo how is it so far?\u201d asked a woman\u2019s voice on the other end.Our phone line is terrible, but I still did not recognize the voice.\u201cExcuse me? I think you may have the wrong number.\u201d\u201cNo, I have the correct number. How are you finding Murakami\u2019s new novel?\u201d the woman asked.I was slightly taken aback. How could this caller know that I started Murakami\u2019s new novel that morning, the first morning of my newly found unemployment?\u201cAre you from Kinokuniya?\u201d I asked. I had purchased the book in the city on Saturday. Maybe they could identify me from my loyalty card and were doing some marketing research.\u201cIn a way, yes.\u201d She replied. \u201cMy name is Moriko. It means child of the forest. So what are your initial thoughts on the novel?\u201d\u201cWell I haven\u2019t much time to get into the novel yet. But from what I have read it seems to be a very standard Murakami novel with similar themes as his other works. His main character is an everyday man, who is single an unmarried and who has a troubled past that he would like to put behind him. He also designs train stations. That\u2019s kinda weird and cool.\u201d\u201cVery good, very good. I shall call tomorrow.\u201d And she abruptly hung up.The next day the phone call came at around the same time. I had just finished up sweeping leaves in the garden and had sat down to prepare for the lesson I was giving that night. I had resigned from my full-time day job, but I was still teaching Chemistry at the local university three nights a week.\u201cHello Brendon. Would you like to share more of your thoughts on Murakami\u2019s new novel?\u201d\u201cHello Moriko,\u201d I said enthusiastically. \u201cHow are you this afternoon?\u201d\u201cI am well thank you Brendon. But I would like to hear your thoughts on the new Murakami novel,\u201d she said curtly.I was taken aback for a moment, but thought nothing more of it.\u201cI have progressed a little. The main character has found a friend that cooks him meals and they listen to music together. And he has talked about how he is estranged from his family and especially his father who recently died. He then goes on to explain how his father named him\u2026 But I have just gotten up to one of those flashback chapters that Murakami loves so much\u2026 You know, they\u2019ll be during a war or something and they\u2019ll involve a well. They are just so distracting that I need to psych myself up to get through with that distraction.\u201dI kept getting distracted throughout this time by a scratching noise at the door.\u201cThat will be your cat Galileo wanting to come in, \u201coffered Moriko.\u201cBut I don\u2019t own a cat.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019d know if I owned a cat or not. Especially if it was named after one of the greatest scientists who ever lived.\u201d\u201cOh, I am getting you confused with the other Brendon that I am in conversation with about the book. Many apologies. I will call again tomorrow.\u201dAnd she promptly hung up.The next day I was teaching, filing in for a colleague who had gone to a conference, and was not home. But I could not shake the image of my telephone ringing endlessly in my empty house.\u201cI now understand why he considers himself colourless,\u201d I stated over the phone the following day. Moriko had called at the same time as before, 3:00 pm, and I had found myself unconsciously doing small jobs waiting for the call.\u201cI see,\u201d offered Moriko. \u201cAnd would you identify with Mr. Tazaki?\u201d\u201cSomewhat, but not hugely. We all pin our identities with those around us. I have loving people in my life at the moment, however apart from my partner I do not find myself defined by them. I guess love for my partner is the only time I have built part of my identity into a relationship. I know that things don\u2019t generally last forever, and the things that do change.\u201d \u201cThank you for your time Brendon. We will talk again tomorrow.\u201dI managed to get a quick \u201cGoodbye\u201d in before the phone hung up.\u201cHow did you find the ending Brendon?\u201d Moriko asked on the Friday afternoon.\u201cWell, I did like how the novel left off. Incomplete. Hang on, how did you know I was finished?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just call it women\u2019s intuition,\u201d replied Moriko. \u201cRight,\u201d I said skeptically. \u201cBut I enjoyed how Tsukuru found out about his past and some of the mystery was solved. He had presumed the worst all along, but the people that he reconnected with knew the truth and even suspected it. He had once again presumed the worst and had little self-worth. I am glad he had an epiphany about his priorities at the end. Even if it doesn't turn out I believe he would be much happier and would be able to deal with rejection in a much healthier way.\u201d\u201cThank you for your thoughts Brendon. I am glad you enjoyed Mr. Murakami\u2019s latest book.\u201d\u201cThank you for listening to my thoughts Moriko.\u201d\u201cYou are very welcome Brendon.\u201dAnd she hung up.I stood for a while next to the phone pondering these strange conversations I had over the previous week with Moriko and had a strange feeling that this was not the last I would hear from her.After all a new Murakami work called 'The Strange Library' was set to come out in a few more months."}, {"userName": "Xandra", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6600821-xandra", "userReview": "I wish I could tell you this book is about gregarious men, women who are more than their boobs and their stupid advice, disdain for train stations, vivacious characters, solvable mysteries. Hell, I wish I could tell you it\u2019s about unicorns, shoguns and samurai clans, aliens, post-apocalyptic Japan, killer penguins or the Russian tundra. Anything other than the old Murakami tropes again. Surprising no one, the book deals with lost friendship and the exasperating whining that derives from that. To be more specific, the story follows a typical Murakami-esque dude whose group of friends suddenly gives him the cold shoulder and, sixteen years later, he\u2019s finally determined by his girlfriend to visit them one by one and clear things up. A more puerile premise has never been thought of.I\u2019ve clearly reached a point where the more Murakami I read, the more it becomes apparent that he\u2019s a one trick pony. You might rightly assert that most authors are, but he takes it to another level. It\u2019s more than his voice and his writing style; it\u2019s, well\u2026 everything. He recreates the same main character \u2013 the insular, self-deprecating man, who women always find special and jump at the opportunity to dictate the course of his life - each time more or less successfully, with the same relationship dynamics between him and the women in his life and the same themes ranging from the more general theme of alienation to something more specific like a passion for train stations or people watching. It\u2019s become so repetitive that the plot development is often not a surprise anymore and you know when certain elements are cue for a flashback, an observation regarding a woman\u2019s looks, an erection, not an erection, bad sex or weird shit. Sadly, the repetition isn\u2019t limited to the reiteration of themes in different books; it\u2019s noticeable within the same work too. This book, for instance, would have made a decent short story if it weren\u2019t for about 150 pages of sheer redundancy. Cut down one or two friends, go easier on the relationship drama, stop describing every step of the way, give the guy a pair of balls for fuck\u2019s sake and you\u2019d actually have a chance to not bore your audience. One reviewer describes the book as full of oneiric, poetic and metaphoric elements. Is Tsukuru\u2019s story oneiric? If you\u2019re referring to his many erotic dreams about threesomes, then hell yeah. Poetic and metaphoric? Sure. Then again, with Murakami\u2019s reputation of being cryptic, he could say virtually anything and someone would consider it \u201cpoetic and metaphoric\u201d. Just ask most literary critics. They see poetry and metaphors in everything. Then there\u2019s the obligatory magical stuff. Not too much of it here, the book is pretty logical and straightforward. Still, he can\u2019t help but include a ludicrous story about a man who claims he has one month to live because an \u201cordinary person\u201d told him so and who could avoid death only by meeting someone who\u2019s willing to die in his stead (no signed papers needed, he informs) and, as a compensation for his imminent death, he\u2019s invested with the gift of seeing people\u2019s colors, which are like halos around their head. Pretty cringe worthy, huh? Which is not to say I\u2019m not tempted to paint those pages on my ceiling so I can start the rest of my days with a big laugh. I bet it never gets old.And let\u2019s not forget the \u201cOh joy! Here he starts with the parallel realities again!\u201d moment. When crazy shit happens, Tsukuru predictably jumps to the logical conclusion that time bifurcated and created another reality. Not even once does he think: \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m a bit bonkers. Going on and on (and on and on\u2026) about how my high school group kicked me out of their midst, how we were brought together by some sort of divine intervention, how I\u2019ve become suicidal and suffered for almost two freaking decades. Guess it\u2019s time for some therapy.\u201d Funny as it is, how many times can Murakami pull the alternate reality card before it becomes irksome? Give me a break with this magic-for-the-sake-of-it crap already!In the second half, the redundancy becomes more and more evident and makes way for some very amateurish writing. It\u2019s insulting to the readers to have the main character offer to talk to one of his old friends about his girlfriend and have him repeat what we already know thanks to not sleeping when the first hundred pages happened. And don\u2019t you think it qualifies as oversharing to mention to a woman you haven't seen in sixteen years and who\u2019s the constant object of your erotic dreams that you weren\u2019t able to \u201cpenetrate\u201d your girlfriend the last time you saw her? Sincerity, you say? Well, I guess. Big-tits Eri, eager to fulfill the trope, is happy to offer ludicrous relationship advice and put up with Tsukuru\u2019s whining. \u201cI have no personality, no defined color. I have nothing to offer to others. This has always been my problem. I feel like an empty vessel.\u201d Well, boo hoo. It\u2019s the fiftieth time you lament about this. Also, news flash: you have a personality and it\u2019s a very annoying one. I feel I\u2019m a bit unfair with this book because there was a good part of the first hundred pages that I enjoyed despite the simplistic writing and the formulaic plot. I didn\u2019t get much out of it though. For a guy who prides himself in being mysterious, Murakami unforgivably lacks subtlety and his books feel like copies of one another. I could advise you to forget about Tsukuru Tazaki and choose Hard-Boiled Wonderland... instead, but, if my history of reading Murakami is any indication, I\u2019m a bad reader of his work and my often incongruous opinion counts for nothing."}, {"userName": "Koen Van den Eeckhout", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout", "userReview": "To me, Murakami's books are like ice cream. Many people will claim that it's just more of the same, and in a way they are right. But I am not complaining, because it's just more of the same delicious, luscious thing. Also, while a too large bowl of ice cream can cause stomach troubles (maybe like The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles), this time Murakami limits himself to a nice amount of 360 pages.I will not go into much detail on the plot. At the age of 20, Tsukuru Tazaki is kicked out of his brotherhood of five friends, three boys and two girls. Each of them has a colorful name: Red, Blue, White and Black, except for Tsukuru. It's representative for the way he thinks about himself: colorless, with nothing valuable to offer the rest of the group - or even the world. Little does he know that that's not the way the others think about him. So, which point of view is the right one?The major part of the book is a quest to find out why he was so harshly removed from his circle of friends. A quest set to the tones of 'Le mal du pays', a melancholic melody from Liszt's 'Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage' (a hint towards the title of the book). All of this gives the book an atmosphere very similar to Norwegian Wood.I had a hard time deciding whether to give this book four or five stars. On the positive side: I love the melancholic atmosphere, the story is not too intangible, it has the perfect length, the characters are believable, I - almost - couldn't put it down. On the negative side: some readers (maybe those not very familiar with Murakami) will remain dissatisfied. There are several loose ends and some unexplained situations. In other words, it's more of the same old thing.I love it."}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "Source of the original image here.No bingo this time.I've had an awfully hard time trying to write a review for this one. When I try to write an honest review, non-professional that I am, I try to write something that's 1) more substantive than what the back blurb would say, and 2) something which would help myself or any other reader distinguish this from anything else the author has written. I don't always meet both of these qualifications, but here I'm just at a total loss. The basic tropes of Murakami are the same as before - but then again, many fiction writers have favorite or recurring images in their works - to take an almost random sample, Borges has his labyrinths, Twain has steamboats, Tolstoy has French, Vollmann has his whores and WW2 references. To continue this extended example, Murakami has his trains, weird sex, and urban ennui. But now we're at the point where I'm having a hard time telling this book apart from the rest of his work. Murakami even stays with the same emotional motifs - the difficulty of growing up, the hard truths about how people change as time passes. There's a touch of magical realism here, but not as much as 1Q84 or the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. There's also a possibility of whether all these books about ennui have their own 'meta-narrative' - as if writing on ennui necessarily leads to repetition because it's a stunting process in our own emotional growth. It's almost as if boredom and fear of the unknown are easily translated concepts, and thus a more understood part of Murakami's own appeal. Colorless Tsukuru is not a bad book, but one which fades into the rest of Murakami's work. If these toils and troubles ache out for you still strongly, then this book is another worthy place for them. If not, then go elsewhere."}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2158493-sophie", "userReview": "(Note: there's a big spoiler in this review, but I'm going to mark it so you should be able to skip it.)I wanted to like this book. I ordered it after reading the description in the German preview, and I could hardly wait. The plot sounded intriguing, and this was going to be the first \"real\" novel I was going to read in Japanese, and it was by an author whose works I mostly enjoyed until then. This was going to be so good!And it was, in the beginning. Tazaki Tsukuru used to be part of a group of very close friends in high school, and even after that, but then suddenly they all avoid him and tell him to never contact him again. The reason? \"You should know why.\" After that experience, he's plunged into a deep depression and almost killed himself. Still, he somehow made it through that time and more or less has put it past him, or so he thinks, until 16 years later he starts dating a woman who tells him he should try to find out what exactly happened back then in order to sort himself out. The beginning starts out really strong, and I have to say I could relate to both the depression and the experience very well. And throughout the novel, whenever women aren't involved, it's a good book - Murakami isn't a bad writer, and he's insightful (although a lot of the conclusions Tsukuru finally comes to could also be found in a Paulo Coelho book and no that is not a compliment) and smart. Which makes his treatment of women all the more infuriating. I actually don't feel like reiterating all the sickening old-man's fantasies right here, or the constant breast-fixation which ruined an otherwise really good scene for me. (And even when he remembers that scene later, it's always \"her breasts, her breasts, her breasts\". I am sorry, that is disgusting. And if all men do that, it's disgusting.) What I take the most issue with is the reason his friends cut off all contact with him. Now follows the spoiler.SPOILER STARTI hate false rape accusations as a plot point. Our culture being as it is, women have a hard enough time being taken seriously when they say they have been raped even without that kind of plot point being perpetuated again and again. No matter how good the book - and I have yet to read one with a false rape accusation that wasn't bad - it's harmful, especially because it suggests it's something that happens a lot more often than it does, considering how often it's used in movies and books and whatnot. And in this case it's even worse because it wouldn't even have been necessary, in my opinion, at least considering how the plot develops and the final conclusion Tsukuru comes to concerning Shiro. And then there's the giant plot hole of doom: how useless must the Japanese police be if, after Shio's murder, Tsukuru doesn't become their main suspect? I mean, I've read enough mysteries and watched enough procedurals to know you look for someone with a motive. And you look at the suspect's past. \"Oh, so she was part of a group of five close friends? What happened to that circle of friends? Why are they not close anymore?\" Seriously, that pissed me off so much because it's sloppy. I don't care about not finding out who really raped Shiro, I don't care about finding out who killed her, I don't even care about what happened to Haida [even though the fact that Tsukuru's Kinda Sorta Gay Episode never really gets resolved], but that requires a ridiculous suspension of disbelief that I am apparently not capable of (and I read BL novels for a - well, not for a living, but I read a lot of them and I am good as suspending my disbelief, is what I'm saying).END SPOILERS.All in all the bad parts of this book stand out all the more because of the good parts, you could say. I am incapable of giving it just one star, but at the same time I am incapable of giving it more than two. While it is a book I ended up thinking a lot about, I really didn't like it and it's very unlikely I'll ever pick up another book by Murakami because his misogynism is not something I want to engage with again."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "[Professor Googlewiki:\"Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage (Years of Pilgrimage) (S.160, S.161, S.163) is a set of three suites for solo piano by Franz Liszt. Much of it derives from his earlier work, Album d'un voyageur, his first major published piano cycle, which was composed between 1835 and 1838 and published in 1842.Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage is widely considered a masterwork and summation of Liszt's musical style. The third volume is notable as an example of his later style. Composed well after the first two volumes, it displays less showy virtuosity and more harmonic experimentation.The title Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage refers to Goethe's famous novel of self-realization, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship. Liszt clearly places the work in line with the Romantic literature of his time, prefacing most pieces with a literary passage from writers such as Schiller, Byron or Senancour, and, in an introduction to the entire work, writing:'Having recently travelled to many new countries, through different settings and places consecrated by history and poetry; having felt that the phenomena of nature and their attendant sights did not pass before my eyes as pointless images but stirred deep emotions in my soul, and that between us a vague but immediate relationship had established itself, an undefined but real rapport, an inexplicable but undeniable communication, I have tried to portray in music a few of my strongest sensations and most lively impressions.'\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann%C3%A...Liszt's caption for \"Les cloches de Gen\u00e8ve: Nocturne (The Bells of Geneva: Nocturne)\" is from Byron's \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\": \u201cI live not in myself, but I become Portion of that around me.\u201d (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "This is easily one of the saddest books I have ever read. I found it extremely difficult to read in places. I know what it is to lose friends, to have people randomly walk out of your life as if you never existed: it\u2019s not a nice feeling after years of friendship.For Tsukuru its four friends and they all exit at once. He gets a phone call from one of them informing him that the group have unanimously decided that he is no longer part of it. The shock is something that he carries with him for his entire life. He loved his four friends and their departure has left him with an undying fear, a fear of ever getting close to anyone ever again. \u201cIt\u2019s as if he was sleepwalking through life, as if he had already died but not yet noticed it.\"\"Before him lay a huge, dark abyss that ran straight through to the earth\u2019s core. All he could see was a thick cloud of nothingness swirling around him; all he could hear was a profound silence squeezing his eardrums.\u201d He had no idea why it happened and it has haunted him ever since. It made him question his own identity and his purpose in life, ultimately turning him into a cynic. He never expected to find joy again or any sense of happiness. He trudges through life, colourless and utterly dead inside. On the surface he is successful but inside he is a wreck, existing though not living. After sixteen years he decides to face his past and re-connect with those that abandoned him so mercilessly. He goes back to find the reason that almost destroyed him. Murakami captures the intensity of emotions to such powerful effect through exploring such a history. Few writers can get such feeling into their writing. We are all waiting for something or longing for something. I wonder how many people are truly happy in life? Not many. When we find our shot at happiness we fly straight towards it and do everything we can to ensure that it never leaves us. And if it does leave us, well, the aftermath is worse than death. When Tsukuru\u2019s friends abandon him, he no longer is the same person. It\u2019s as simple as that. He must find himself once more to carry on living. \n\u201cThe human heart is like a night bird. Silently waiting for something, and when the time comes, it flies straight toward it.\u201d\nColorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage is an absolutely fantastic novel, and, as with Norwegian Wood, reading it may hurt.

Murakami is a genius at writing with emotions swirling beneath the text. He gets the importance of the notes AND the silence of prose; of the unsaid, dreamy place that is both recognized and strange.This isn't his most exciting work, but it is clearly not a throw-away either. It brings all the usual suspects to the Murakami table. Murakami writes best when he makes the reader feel like they are just near the surface of wakefulness. He bends the reader into a zone where it feels like a strange contractive tendency of the surface between sleep and wakefulness between musical, lucid dreams and surreal, philosophical nightmares.It feels like you are balancing blind on the edge of a train platform; you feel the sound of the train and feel the compression of his words, but don't know if the Murakami train is going to hit you from the left or the right."}, {"userName": "K.D.

I am torn between 2 and 3 stars but since there are no talking cats, flying leeches or Colonel Sanders in this book, I am giving this a 3. I liked this book. I mean, I loved \"Wind-Up Bird\" but it was one of my first Murakami books, I was a lot younger then and I still did not know that Murakami recycles the same ingredients when he cooks.This book is almost like a rehash of \"Norwegian Wood.\" Tsukuru Tazaki in this book is 36 and Toru Watanabe in Norwegian is 37 and they look back to the events that happen in their past particularly during their adolescent period. Both gentlemen had friends during that time and what happened with them affected their mental framework that they now have to sort things out and they probably just need to go to the shrink, lie down on the couch and pour out what's in the minds. It would save them a lot as Tazari would not need to Finland to hunt Kuro who says that she now prefers to be called Eri and I hate people doing that. If you are Kuro to me when we were younger, you will always be Kuro even if you are old as the name brings back our memories and they better be happy because if not, then I will probably not talk or even see you anymore.What I am trying to say is that the characters in this book are self-absorbed. Tsukuru says that he is colorless because his name has not word that denotes color in Japanese (ehem, my surname is Oliveros and I know that olive is a color) and he has nothing to give and he has nowhere to go. Then later in the story, when, after 16 years, his friends tell him that he is the most handsome and in fact probably 3 (2 girls and 1 gay) of the four had hots on him. He is also the son of a wealthy businessman who owns a condo unit in Tokyo and he has nothing to give? Oh come on, in the Philippines, we call this person maarte or emotero. The saving grace of this book though, it is ability to make you look back at your past especially those that influence your personality: those events that made you who you are now. Last month, my first girlfriend died of heart attack. She was still single at 51. I was told that she did not have a boyfriend other than me and in fact we did not have a formal breakup. We were in that island (my hometown) in the Pacific and we were in third year high school (15/16 years old) when we fell in love with each other and our relationship stayed up to the following year. However, her family had no money to send her to college. So, when I left to go to the city, I did not say goodbye thinking that we would still be communicating. But things just got to busy for me in college: no time to write letters because I had to help running the boarding house of my grandmother when I was not in school or sleeping or studying my lessons. No money even for stamps as my parents had tuition and food money but not for anything else including sometimes, decent clothes. So, our relationship just fizzled like that and no time or effort to have a closure. We just did not chase each other. I was busy and fell in love with a couple of other girls before marrying my wife ten years after the last time I left the island.What I am trying to say here is that I felt pain when I heard the news that morning. The pain of losing a part of me. I loved her when I was 15 till 16 years old but still she was part of who I am now. As the book says something like: \"You can forget about the past but you cannot erase the history of it.\" (I tried looking for the exact words as I forgot to dogear the page haha).Not the best Murakami. I'd still go for \"Kafka on the Shore\" or \"After Dark\" or \"Wind Up Bird.\" Those all got 4 stars from me. But this brought back Murakami for me.

That's because this novel combines an intriguing and puzzling plot with a beautiful and simple way of looking at life. I was fascinated with the protagonist's way of thinking and dealing reasonably with life, and furthermore it was a pleasure to once again read a story set in Japan because it inevitably intertwines with Japanese culture. Regrettably, this book didn't come with a lot of magical realism which is, however, a common trait of Murakami's. I didn't miss any, though, because the story worked so well on its own, and I think that if you kind of like Murakami but don't agree with magical realism, this would be just the book for you. A story about loss, a story about identity and a story about finding the answers to your questions and fill out the holes inside of you. This was magnificent, and needless to say I flew through it in less than a day."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9968594-maria", "userReview": "\u201cYou can hide memories, but you can't erase the history that produced them.\u201d This is barely my second Murakami reading. Having \"Kafka on the Shore\" in my mind, read just a couple of months ago, I thought I would also find that bizarre, transcendental and almost phantasmagorical similar experience. \"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\" is written under a complete different ambiance, yet it possesses certain Murakami essentials I begin to recognize in his style and probably every other Murakami fan is already completely familiar with: The jazz, the symbolic dreams, the sexual fantasies, those metaphysical experiences, a voyage to the subconscious mind of the character. Tsukuru Tasaki (whose name means \"To build\") belongs to a symbiotic group of five friends. Each one of their names represent a color as well as each one possess a certain quality or talent except Tsukuru, at least that's how he constantly feels. After a sudden and unexpected event, Tsukuru is simply cut down from this quintessential group. Deeply affected by this and without receiving or asking for an explanation he decides to leave to Tokyo, where he becomes an engineer and works for a company that builds train stations. Tsukuru does not only leaves Nagoya to try to overcome this dark episode of his life, he also becomes unavailable to make new friends out of fear of experiencing rejection again in his life. \"Because I have no sense of self. I have no personality, no brilliant color. I have nothing to offer. That's always been my problem. I feel like an empty vessel. I have a shape, I guess, as a container, but there's nothing inside....\"Have you ever had that feeling, of not belonging? No matter how hard you try, you're just not made to fit like the rest of your group. Are YOU just as colorless as the main character of this story? If you have ever had those feelings then you'll probably understand Tsukuru emotional struggle. This story appears as a simple one but is not at all, the brilliance of this books relies not in a complex plot or an elaborated use of language, but more in giving the reader the ability to experience the solitude, the loneliness of the character. For me, \"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\" more than a reading was like enjoying a soft melody, not over-thinking or analyzing it, just relaxing and letting myself experience Tsukuru's mixture of feelings and thoughts. The book is exactly like the piano musical piece that Murakami offers us in this occasion: \"Years of Pilgrimage\", the narrative follows a very relaxing and smooth flow of lyricism that simply captivates you.\"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\" is not only about loneliness, a depressive story behind this young man, is also about friendship. In the middle of such emptiness, Tsukuru finds Sara, that unique friend we are fortunate to find in our lives that help us confront our fears, our pains and become a wonderful guide, someone who holds our hand through a long journey to rediscover ourselves and give us a second chance to perhaps love once again. \"It was a wonderful thing to be able to truly want someone like this-- the feeling was so real, so overpowering. He hadn't felt this way in ages. Maybe he never had before. Not that everything about it was wonderful: his chest ached, he found it hard to breathe, and a fear, a dark oscillation, had hold of him. But now even that kind of ache had become an important part of the affection he felt. He didn't want to let that feeling slip from his grasp. Once lost, he might never happen across that warmth again. If he had to lose it, he would rather lose himself.\" Do you have someone in your life, from your past, you need to confront, to forgive and maybe let go a heavy burden you've been carrying all along during your entire life? I do. Maybe I don't know what color would I represent in this world of Murakami, but what I do know, is that life consists of a continuous search of dreams, experiences, and those daily details that make our ephemeral life full of brilliant colors.\"Don't let the bad elves get you!\"To listen \"Le mal du pays\" by Lazar Berman --> http://youtu.be/FDWUvc5wv7U"}, {"userName": "Praveen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6203616-praveen", "userReview": "[non realised astral projections.

So I will leave the preamble to Robert J. Wiersema\u2019s thoughts in The National Post, which sadly echoed my sentiments exactly. \"Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and his Years of Pilgrimage is a stirring novel of loss and conciliation, of unanswerable mysteries, fragile hope. There are passages of considerable beauty and insight, and moments of magic and a sense of the sublime which we have come to expect from Murakami. At its most basic level, it will satisfy most Murakami readers.Unfortunately, it likely won\u2019t do much more than satisfy; it\u2019s a problematic novel, on a number of levels.Crucially, it seems uncertain and tentative. Where Murakami is typically at ease in describing such things as talking cats and sheep-men, here he seems to falter with the very basics of human interaction. The dialogue is stilted and stagy (beyond even what can be explained away through the process of being translated from the Japanese), and the narrative shudders unevenly.While its important that Tsukuru\u2019s character be something of an empty vessel (his nickname comes from the fact that his four high school friends all had names which referred to colours and he did not; his colourlessness was an in-joke that became a character trait), Murakami takes it too far, and Tsukuru vacillates between extreme emotionalism and a complete lack of affect that is disconcerting and unconvincing.Even the construction of the novel feels uncertain: There is so much recapping and summarizing (including in the final chapter), one might be forgiven for thinking that the novel was originally published in instalments, necessitating that sort of summary.Make no mistake: Even a flawed Murakami novel is worth reading, and better than most of the other options on the shelf. One wishes, though, that it were better. Coming as it does in the wake of 1Q84, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and his Years of Pilgrimage was always going to be a smaller Murakami novel. Unfortunately, it turns out it\u2019s a minor novel, as well.\"The reviewer put his fingers on all the elements that were missing for me in this novel that I was very much looking forward to reading, like the rest of the planet. The main character's complete lack of affect was its main undoing for me. I could not bring myself to care enough for his plight, when the entire novel's emotional foundation depends on the reader's empathy. The explanations behind some of the puzzles at the heart of the story seemed random and forced, without any real basis or meaning. The entire novel felt like a long, erratic walk going nowhere, along which Murakami's usual suspects (a piece of classical music, a recurring dream, an unexplained obsession, etc) did not gather the momentum that they usually do. The lingering taste being one of blandness and aimlessness. Some scenes towards the end were vivid and memorable but all in all I kept thinking about how much I missed the sanguinity, rawness and audacity of \"1Q84\"."}, {"userName": "Lea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea", "userReview": "My first Murakami, and probably my last. After all the raves for Murakami, I expected this to blow me away. Even as I found my enthusiasm waning, I still thought there would come a point where the author would pull all the pieces together and I would have this sudden a-ha moment -- I was really looking forward to that. Even when I reached the point of literally forcing myself to continue -- come on, you can do it, only three more chapters! -- I STILL thought there would be SOMETHING to make the whole endeavor worthwhile . . .Nope.I'm actually left wondering if Murakami is more akin to \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", where everyone says how deep and amazing he is in order to hide the fact that they really don't get what all the fuss is about either.There was absolutely nothing I liked about this book -- the plot was dry, so so dry, and the characters not even remotely likable. What I assume is some kind of symbolism -- the swimming, the piano piece, the never ending discussions about railway stations -- just never add up to anything.Except boredom. And let me tell you, I am NEVER bored. I'm one of those people who doesn't even understand the concept of boredom -- much to the dismay of my children -- yet this book completely broke me.

I was at first enchanted by 1Q84\u2019s mystery, unique, easy-to-read style and peculiar dialogue. I was less impressed by my second dip into the Murakami pool in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, though I realize a lot of people love that novel. So, this was it, Murakami\u2019s last chance. Would he wow me with Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage, or leave me out in the cold.Dear reader, the star-rating is at the top, so you already know what I thought of this steaming mess. My problems with The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle are present here again in Colorless. Murakami\u2019s simplistic language just seems uninspired, and the occasional odd word choice just seems like poor translation rather than a cool stylistic trick. Also, while I was swept away by the ethereal feel of 1Q84 (really, I\u2019d read nothing like it before), it just seems that Murakami likes all of his writing to be filled with oppressive vagueness. In Colorless, Murakami populates the story with dialogue that feel flippant, passages that are extraneous under the guise of profundity, and some of the worst literary device use the world has ever seen.But you don\u2019t believe me? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you covered.\u201dThe original purpose, like I said, was to help out at an after school program. This was where we all met and we all felt strongly about it\u2014it remained an important collective goal. But as time passed, simply becoming a community ourselves became a goal too.\u201d\u201cYou mean maintaining the group itself, and keeping it going, became one of your aims?\u201d\u201cI guess so.\u201dSara narrowed her eyes in a tight line. \u201cJust like the universe.\u201dMe once I realized that 362 pages of this type of mess were to follow.JUST LIKE THE UNIVERSE? That has to be the weakest attempt at a serious thought I\u2019ve read in a long time. I can\u2019t think of anything that would fit so well with just about ANY OTHER CONCEPT as the universe. It is, as they say, universal. But you don\u2019t believe me? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve written my own version of the passage.\u201dI had a particularly malodorous bowel movement the other day. Once I had finished with my regular habits, I flushed the offensive matter down the drain. But as time passed, the scent continued to linger.\u201d\u201cYou mean maintaining the smell, became the aim of the feces?\u201d \u201cI guess so.\u201dSara narrowed her eyes in a tight line. \u201cJust like the universe.\u201dAh, perhaps you are thinking to yourself, Low blow, Matthew. Toilet humor to try and get your point across? Have some decency. But that\u2019s another of my axes to grind with Murakami, he writes passages that are just straight up gross. I mean, do you really want to read a book that uses \u201ccopious semen\u201d multiple times in a single chapter? Do you enjoy the rape-y ghost erotica that Murakami writes? I for one, have expended my tolerance for the subject in Murakami\u2019s hands after initially processing 1Q84\u2019s sexual deviance as a novel type of story. Instead, this is seemingly Murakami\u2019s modus operandi. I can\u2019t say that any other book has had the ability to travel back in time and make me question what I ever had enjoyed in the author\u2019s work to begin with. In that respect, I suppose he has impressed me. Was he always painting this ill-defined subject? Am I able to appreciate 1Q84\u2019s nebulous ending now that I know that this is just what Murakami seems to do with all of his stories? The answer is mixed. A bit of a yes and a no. My enjoyment of 1Q84 when I first read it is not robbed by Colorless\u2019s mediocrity, it just spoils my view of his writing.Oh yeah! How about that story? Tsukuru Tazaki\u2019s four friends abandoned him without an explanation 16 years ago. Since then, he\u2019s been down in the dumps and has never quite recovered from this desertion, but boy, does Tsukuru ever like the subway! So, he meets a new woman who suggests that Tsukuru has some unresolved feelings about his past, and he needs to reconcile them in order to move forward with their relationship.So, a slightly compelling premise: why did his friends cut ties with him? SPOILERS: it doesn\u2019t matter, because they all decide in the end that they couldn\u2019t have believed what he was accused of if they\u2019d really thought about it, so, SORRY FOR BEING DICKS, TSUKURU, PEACE OUT. It is a pain to get through, and I felt the character underwent no development, the words he and others spoke were empty, and that Murakami, I can only assume, plotting to rob my weekend of a good readI\u2019m sure a lot of readers out there are going to tell me I missed the point, or I don\u2019t understand the culture, or that my review has been unnecessarily angry. You know, that\u2019s a fair point. Maybe I did miss the point, or there\u2019s some deeper meaning here that flies over my head because of a lack of cultural understanding. But, here\u2019s the thing: there\u2019s so many great books out there and I foolishly took my weekend to read this novel. I have a stack of 20+ novels that I\u2019ve been waiting to get into, and instead I spent my time reading this book. This book that offered me no reward for my time spent, and instead penalized me for picking it up. True, I could have just abandoned the book at its outset, but that\u2019s just not my style. A single positive thing I have to say about the book: the cover and binding on this North American hardcover edition is quite beautiful. A stylized subway map of Japan overlaid with stripes of colour, wrapped in a semi-translucent dust-jacket. The feel of the hardcover binding is obviously high quality and has a fantastically smooth feeling in your hands. So, props to Bond Street Books for nailing this design: it really makes for a pretty book.But, truly, you\u2019d be remiss to think that this book\u2019s cover makes up for the suffering I experience between its pages.

You have to relinquish your expectations based on what you may love in Murikami\u2019s other writing, his wild rides of personal discovery with comic overlays of head-scratching mystery and magic realism. No cats or Colonel Sanders. Instead, we get a story of a man frozen in his development due to an abandonment by a special circle of friends from school. The persistent dwelling by Tazaki on his loss and his steps in his 30\u2019s to unscrew its inscrutability of this emotional impasse has an overall flavor of reflective minimalism. Voila, a Japanese novel.We start with Tazaki in the throes of contemplating suicide, with all color in his life drained away.  The reason why death had such a hold on Tsukuru Tazaki was clear. One day his four closest friends, te friends he\u2019d known for a long time, annlounced that tey did not want to see him, ever again. It was a sudden, decisive declaration, not a word, for this harsh pronouncement. And Tsukuru didn\u2019t dare ask.He recounts what was so wonderful about his circle with four friends in high school in Nagoya, all involved with him in volunteer projects in the community. Each seems so special, so colorful in their personalities and capabilities, which strangely enough aligns with the fact that each has a color in their names. Tazaki has no such attribute of name or personality, but he feels wanted and believes he complements somehow the perfection of this group. He chooses to go away to Tokyo for college where he will study engineering and fulfill his ambition to build train stations and come home for holidays and summers to thrive in his group. But the sudden message to break off all contact throws him for a loop. He enters a path of solitude and dogged persistence over the next decade, avoiding returns to Nagoya as much as possible. Only when his relationships with women fail to come to fruitition does he get the gumption to demand answers. No relationship can ever achieve the spiritual love he felt for the two boys and girls of the circle he had.A big challenge for the reader is why Tazaki didn\u2019t push hard for answers early on. Can anyone be that meek? The only analogy I can think of is some of my own reactions to the sundering of divorce. My mind sought reasons tings fell apart, and the answers were elusive. Was there something illusory in the bonds from the beginning or did one of us change so much that their meanings changed too much? Or were the bonds good and true, but blundering mistakes stretched them too far to recover? The kind that makes you want to rewrite history and erase those mistakes? Tazaki searches his soul for what might be missing in himself that makes him unloveable. At times his actions in his dreams about his friends makes him wonder if he did something awful that he has somehow forgotten. At times the dark erotic content of his dreams make us wonder if Tazaki has a screw loose somewhere and really did commit some egregious act. These uncertainties kept me quite engaged in the story. Why is Tazaki\u2019s later effort to unravel the mystery likened to a pilgrimage? Accompanying us on the journey is a piece of Listz music, Le mal du pays, that one of the women in the circle used to play, a tune that translates roughly as \u201chomesickness\u201d. It makes for a wonderful overlay to the story. The satisfaction I got from this novel resembles somewhat the pleasures of reading David Mitchell\u2019s relatively conventional coming-of-age story \u201cBlack Swan Green.\u201d It also resonates with the unreliable memories of past transgressions in Julian Barnes \u201cA Sense of an Ending\u201d and to some extent the long impact of calumny in Ian McEwan\u2019s \u201cAtonement.\u201d The book impels me to try to find my color now before it\u2019s too late."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL":

They were inseparable, four fingers and a thumb. But without explanation, Tsukuru is cut loose.And so, colorless, Tsukuru Tazaki watches train stations. (I thought maybe Murakami was channeling Bohumil Hrabal, but he's not.) Then he builds train stations. Yet his life is a void. So Murakami, this time without the magic realism, tells us why Tsukuru was rejected and we watch to see if color will come back into his life.That the plot is stupid doesn't matter much, if you like Murakami. And I do. He even picked the perfect music for sitting in a train station and watching the people come and go, until the night comes; or for taking a first vacation, to Finland in the Summer, when night never comes.

The ethereal quality of the piece haunts and informs the story.There are doppelg\u00e4ngers everywhere, symbols (or maybe not). Be prepared for sixth fingers and dreams, dreams, dreams.

I'm talking about that reflective period, when you realize you won't get in trouble for having wine with lunch but before you get a tattoo and buy a motorcycle. That kaleidoscope time. If you stopped right now what would be etched on that walk, and what colors would you see? For me it was Loss. I can count them if I try.

Like Tsukuru I\u2019m twenty years old right now and if I\u2019m going to be honest to myself and to you dear reader, it would be a lie if I said I\u2019ve never thought about dying. To explain it, there is a word used often but seldom understood: Depression. Not only a word, more than an emotional state, beyond Kubler-Ross\u2019 stage of grief, it is a living form of intense sorrow that consumes those under its grasps. It eats away the will; it corrodes the strength, and renders those infected unable to make sense of even the most rudimentary functions. Life trickles away slowly, little by little, like, ironically, a stream of blood gushing out of the body until the heart has nothing more to pump and life is gone. Haruki Murakami\u2019s Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage revolves around the story of man broken to pieces when his four closest friends abandon him mysteriously. Anybody who\u2019s lost anybody is naturally bound to feel some sense of loss but due to Tsukuru\u2019s circumstances, being that he was an introvert he didn\u2019t easily make friends and that the five of them formed a group so close and complete, their sudden disappearance in his life opened a chasm of sorrow so dark and deep that he never really got out of it. He hit the chasm\u2019s rock bottom, and he experienced a metamorphosis that changed him to his very core. But though he changed, he never really got over that pain. It stirred away in his heart hidden, but it was never gone. And for twenty years he didn\u2019t know why they abandoned him until circumstances dictated and he was forced into a pilgrimage that took him to far away places like Finland to search for answers. He needed it, Tsukuru suffered from disconnect and isolation, in part due to his timid character, but chiefly because he could never let people into his life again lest they hurt him like his old friends did. This intense solitude developed into a raging depression that shrouded his life. You see, depression, once it has taken hold, you are never really free from its grasps. It may be gone for a time, but the sorrow is embedded in your make up and all you can do is accept it as part of who you are. You may be happy for a time, but the sorrow is always more emphasized and even just a bit of it becomes a misery too unbearable. All you want is for the pain to go away, even if it means life has to go away with it.\u201cOne heart is not connected to another through harmony alone. They are, instead, linked deeply through their wounds. Pain linked to pain, fragility to fragility. There is no silence without a cry of grief, no forgiveness without bloodshed, no acceptance without a passage through acute loss. That is what lies at the root of true harmony.\u201d Connection, acceptance that is all we long for, to share little pieces of our hearts to those around us, and touch theirs in turn. Tsukuru found stability in his otherwise unstable life through people like Haida and Sara. No matter how much he says he prefers loneliness, he is truly happy only when he is with people that he can connect with and accept him for who he truly is. There is a reason why sharing our burdens to others gives a sense of relief. Sorrow is meant to be shared, and pain is meant to be understood. When Tsukuru\u2019s outlet disappeared, he had no one to turn to and bottled everything inside him, that\u2019s why he cracked. We are but fragile containers; too much pressure and we break, we need to pour out to other containers around us to keep ourselves intact. See this is a novel about connections. Making them, losing them, searching for new ones, and finally reflecting whether the connection with life is worth it. The novel culminates with the possibility of life or death for Tsukuru. We are left to decide his faith, mirroring our choice to decide our own. There is no shame in death, in Murakami\u2019s words it is akin to watching the last train disappear little by little until the light of consciousness is gone. But then sometimes, like Tsukuru, we are so fascinated by the trains coming and going that we disregard the people who come and go with them. It is vital to keep in mind that death, like trains, is only a vehicle, something meant to bring people from one place to another, nothing more. Often we are too taken with minor details that we fail to see what\u2019s truly important. The life we lead, the choices we make, the people we connect with, the memories we create, all define who we are. But our final train ride out of life is all the same, we may take different routes, but we all get to the same place. There is nothing personal about death. Oblivion is all the same. Death doesn\u2019t define us. Sitting on a bench in a train station platform watching trains go by is one of the most thoughtful and beautiful allegories for death and depression I\u2019ve ever come across. And it is indeed difficult to look away and find motivation in something else when you\u2019ve been staring at trains for so long. But you can never look away unless you decide that there is something better to look forward to - hope. Hope that someone will sit beside you and take your breath away. Hope that you have a connection. Hope that things will get better. Hope that you will be happy. Hope that the future holds so much more. As said in Tsukuru\u2019s parting words \u201c\u2026hope will never simply vanish.\u201d Murakami\u2019s ability to masterfully string up a novel on a topic so delicate attests to his quiet greatness. His melodic tone is perfectly balanced throughout, never alienating nor dramatizing. And though it takes a while to build up, it never lets down. Certain elements in the novel may have been left hanging but ultimately the fundamental issues are resolved. All things considered, this is a touching and enriching journey to take, one that I\u2019d look forward to taking again in the future.If you\u2019re sitting on a bench in a train station platform watching the trains go by, get up and go. There are people to connect with, choices to make, and memories to create, I hope."}, {"userName": "Michelle Sung", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22336230-michelle-sung", "userReview": "Murakami's latest, \"Colorless Tasaki Tsukuru and His Years of Pilgrimage\" has been compared to his earlier work, \"Norwegian Wood\" by the press, and yes it is similar in that it touches upon similar themes such as the loss of innocence. But i'd say it is about the loss of self-identity in a broader sense, the arbritrariness of human relationships (and our stubborn pursuit for meaning in denial of that arbitrariness), and also the ennui that creeps in during one's 30s and 40s (i.e.,you're not yet too old to give up on living, yet it seems your life path and the options that come along with it have been narrowed so much that there isn't much excitement to look forward to.)While Murakami's works are either a hit or miss for me, i do admire the writer's story-telling skills. I think it says something about a writer who can make you believe in and want to keep on reading about characters jumping out of a whiskey label into real life form and killing people, sly street cats giving you words of wisdom, or two moons appearing in the sky as if it is the most natural thing in the world. This was certainly the case for \"Colorless...\" and i couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. (In the end, i finished the book in one sitting.)The issues i have with this novel from a literary point of view however, are so fundamental, i am not sure that despite the gripping storyline i see it as a well written novel overall. First and foremost, Murakami almost always seems to lose steam in his longer novels and leave a lot of loose ends. Not that i am expecting everything to neatly fall into place by the end as in a detective story, but i couldn't help think that the principle of \"Chekhov's gun\" (\"if a gun appears on stage, it better be fired by the end of the play\") could have been put to good use here for an overall greater delivery of message, image and/or plot. Another thing is that he has become awfully repetitive in his works. Is this the price of being a prolific writer? Should this be simply seen as his signature style? Or is this just his way of establishing logical consistency in the (seemingly illogical, fantasy) world his characters live in? The messages he is trying to deliver may be slightly different from one work to another, but the overarching theme of loneliness and isolation in a post-modern world is virtually the same. As are the details in the characters, the ways the scenes play out, or how he casually name-drops classical and jazz music. From one novel to the next, the tools employed are eerily similar to one another and quite frankly, after 7-8 Murakami books, have become a bit predictable and boring.The last issue i have is that the symbolism and analogy used in this particular novel are too much \"in your face.\" In a way, i suspect this is probably one of the biggest pulls that make Murakami a popular novelist - his works are not too light and has some serious philosophical undertones to them, but are still \"curated\" by the author enough throughout that even someone who isn't familiar with analyzing and dissecting literature would not feel too lost. The main them and messages are highlighted, underlined, and repeated using various techniques and lest you still don't get it, is sometimes even said out loud by some of his characters. In \"Colorless...\", his way of playing curator has been pushed a bit further, and definitely wayyy more than what you would see in his short stories. (Which is one of the reasons i find Murakami's short stories to be much more interesting and better written - there is simply more room for interpretation when the message isn't being screamed out loud all the time.)The symbolisms of \"having color or being colorless\" (as in, a color word included in either one's name or having an aura of color - of distinct personality), of trains and stations (as a metaphor for purpose in life or attachment to life's goals or life itself), of spare fingers (or anything \"spare\" for that matter - what i guess would be a metaphor for existential anxiety), and even the main protagonist's name (Tsukuru, meaning \"to make/ to build\" in Japanese kanji) are really shoved into your face that if you are used to a more subtle type of literature, it might even feel like an insult to your intelligence. However, all this also means it would be a great work to get started with if you're not comfortable with having to pick up on the little cues in novels yourself or are at a loss as to how to analyze novels, or if it is your first Murakami book and you don't want to feel too overwhelmed.For those who have been a consistent reader of Murakami (and for those who read \"Norwegian Wood\" in their early 20s), it would also feel like you've come full circle - the earlier sentiments explored in \"Norwegian Wood\" are still there, just updated and aged (as the characters have) with the patina of the writer himself and the characters (who aren't the exact same people but still have enough similarities to be reminded of their counterparts in \"Norwegian..\").*read the version translated into korean.

las novelas del autor japon\u00e9s. La historia atrapa desde la primera p\u00e1gina, como es habitual en la obra de Murakami, pero se echa en falta esa atm\u00f3sfera hipn\u00f3tica y misteriosa tan caracter\u00edstica, donde se sirve de cierto realismo m\u00e1gico y universos paralelos para explicarnos lo incierto del alma humana. Esta vez, Murakami opta por una historia m\u00e1s realista, sin apenas fantas\u00eda, salvo algunos sue\u00f1os un tanto irreales del protagonista.La trama, narrada en tercera persona, tiene como protagonista a Tsukuru Tazaki, un hombre anodino que en su juventud fue repudiado por sus cuatro mejores amigos, con los cuales formaba una pandilla inseparable. Esta s\u00fabita ruptura acab\u00f3 con la armon\u00eda de su universo, y le hizo pensar seriamente en suicidarse. En el presente, Tsukuru se dedica a dise\u00f1ar estaciones de tren, y es incapaz de forjar relaciones duraderas. Y es que lo que le sucedi\u00f3 en aquellos a\u00f1os todav\u00eda sigue siendo una herida abierta en su interior. Parece que ha llegado la hora de poner orden en su vida y arreglar los asuntos de su pasado.En \u2018Los a\u00f1os de peregrinaci\u00f3n del chico sin color\u2019 nos encontramos con aspectos habituales en Murakami, como son la m\u00fasica, la comida, la soledad y esa mezcla entre lo on\u00edrico y lo real. Es una novela que se lee con fruici\u00f3n y placer, pero creo que se trata de una obra menor dentro de la bibliograf\u00eda de Murakami, casi como un par\u00e9ntesis o un respiro para una obra m\u00e1s grande."}, {"userName": "switterbug (Betsey)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey", "userReview": "Murakami is an artist of seduction when it comes to themes of alienation and dislocation. He takes you into a surreal world, where dreams and reality overlap, classical and jazz music is imbued, and the lonely hero has a soulful journey enriched by his subconscious provocations. His latest novel is tightly focused, more tautly controlled than any of his others that I have read. It concerns railroad station engineer and loner Tsukuru Tazaki, a thirty-six-year-old at a liminal stage between letting go and going forward. He resides in Tokyo and left his hometown of Nagoya when he went to college.Sixteen years ago, our hero\u2019s tightly knit group of four best friends (two other males, two females) ousted him for no discernible reason during his college sophomore summer break (age twenty). The novel opens with Tsukuru\u2019s melancholy and suicidal thoughts, and leads us to the present, where he approaches life with detachment. Now, at thirty-six, he can\u2019t seem to fully expose himself to the vulnerability of love and fulfillment unless he resolves the burning issue of why he was banned all those years ago. This book is his pilgrimage toward wholeness.Tsukuru has always considered himself an empty vessel\u2014\u201ccolorless Tskuru Tazaki\u201d\u2014his name has no color, while the other four friends\u2019 names did. His name signifies \u201cto build,\u201d an apt one for him, who builds for a living. Yet, he feels like a failure, unable to connect meaningfully with other people. (Even his memories of his father are inadequate). He insists that he was inferior to his colorful, vivid group of teenage friends. To himself, he is hollow, a cipher. Now, Tsukuru is on the verge of a serious romance with a somewhat mysterious woman named Sara, which could be sabotaged by his mental state. Sara, knowingly, prompts and inspires him to resolve his past.There are powerful epiphanies, which engage the theme, (such as on page 322), which I think some readers will be compelled to include in their review. However, Tsukuru\u2019s journey is a paced process, and it is imperative that the reader engage with the hero\u2019s odyssey step by step, and (in my opinion) not reveal these later insights that bubble up toward the conclusion. However, it doesn\u2019t hurt to know that the musical theme of the book is Listz\u2019s Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage (Years of Pilgrimage), le mal du pays (Suite 1: Switzerland), especially as played by Lazar Berman. (All three suites are inevitably \u201cheard\u201d in the novel). I have now listened to it several times (on YouTube). It is a perfect metaphor for this book\u2014elegant, melancholy, reflective, subtly captivating.\u201cLe mal du pays\u2026usually it is translated as \u2018homesickness\u2026\u2019it\u2019s more like \u2018a groundless sadness called forth in a person\u2019s heart by a pastoral landscape.\u2019 It\u2019s a hard expression to translate accurately.\u201dThe above is a splendid description for Tsukuru's state of mind, the homesickness a figurative symbol for the four friends from Nagoya, the Liszt piece a consummate harmony for the novel. I suggest listening to it while in the midst of reading this book. It led me to deep-seated places, and palpably brought forth both sorrow and bittersweet buoyancy. I immersed myself into Tsukuru's provocative dreams, and his haunted soul. The universal theme of closure is enhanced by Murakami's hypnagogic imagination. The past, present, and future does a temporal twirl. A wonderfully balanced book!

I hated 1Q84. Hated it. (I won't go into more detail here, I took up enough words on it in my review...) Fortunately, when I voiced this opinion (a little nervously - it\u2019s a very popular book) not only did some people actually agree with me, but I was also overwhelmingly reassured that 1Q84 is not definitive of Murakami\u2019s writing. Determined to give him another chance, I was tentatively hopeful in starting this most recent book.The risk paid off \u2013 Colorless Tsukuru is gorgeous. Here, Murakami\u2019s ponderous repetitions are not frustrating but fluid and captivating, the dream imagery woven throughout adds an otherworldliness to the contemporary urban setting and Tsukuru\u2019s emotional pilgrimage takes on a meditative quality for the reader. Most importantly, there is sex without overwhelming sexism.Reading Colourless Tsukuru is more about the journey than the outcome, and the catalytic events mentioned in all the blurbs and media are less plot, more a series of elements that tie the story together with some degree of forward momentum. Playing in between layers of metaphor and philosophy is the song which gives the book its name, Franz Liszt\u2019s Le mal du pays, from the Years of Pilgrimage suites, which is tied intrinsically into the emotions and fates of the characters. Listening to the music brings Murakami\u2019s words to life, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the story came from the song, rather than the song being brought into the story.I\u2019m always more inclined to suggest reading a hardcopy book than anything digital, but this is one instance where I have to insist: go down to an independent bookstore and pick up the hardback version. A little part of this is the sheet of stickers included with the book, designed based on elements in the story, and though this can be viewed cynically as a mere marketing gimmick, it\u2019s a rather lovely one. The stickers can essentially build illustrations on the cover or throughout the book \u2013 I think there\u2019s a competition involved in this somewhere, but I simply loved the idea of making the book my own. However, the main reason I would insist on forgoing the e-reader here is that this book is an experience that extends beyond reading the words on the page. That experience encompasses the act of opening the book, turning the pages, and, in finally closing it at the end, getting come small amount of closure as Tsukuru waits forever for the impact of a choice that may change his life.Full review herereceived from the publisher through NZ Booklovers"}, {"userName": "Sara Alaee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2016", "userURL":

three boys, two girls. Until one day he wasn't, told he had done something so terrible he was cut out off the group, they would no longer acknowledge him nor have anything to do with him. But why? What had he done? Almost driven to suicide but never really asking what had happened, it will not be until many years later that he will get some of these answers.I had a weird relationship with this book, when I was reading it I was really into it but when I put it down it didn't cry out, pick me up, find out what happened. Anyway it took me over a month to finish this book, but I am glad I did. Japanese books take patience, their emotions are minimalist at best and their reveals are slow. Colorless, as yes the name means quite a bit in this book, may have turned out to be the luckiest, even though he stayed somewhat stunted emotionally. I liked the openness of the ending, it was fitting, letting the reader decide what they think will, happen. A mind boggling, psychologically creative novel, one I can't seem to quit thinking about."}], "description": "\u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0631\u06af \u0633\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u200c\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u062d\u0648\u0633\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0631 \u0633\u0648\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0632\u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0641\u06a9\u0646\u062f. \u06cc\u06a9 \u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0647\u0631 \u06f4 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0635\u0645\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0627\u0634 \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u063a\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u0648\u0642\u062a \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06af\u0634\u062a\u060c \u0628\u0647 \u0633\u0648\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u0646\u062f \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u0646\u062f. \u062d\u062a\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648 \u062d\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0632\u0646\u0646\u062f. \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0637\u0639 \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u06af\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f. \u0631\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0630\u0627\u06a9\u0631\u0647 \u0648 \u0645\u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0647 \u0646\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0646\u062f. \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0632\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u06af\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u0636\u06cc\u062d \u0646\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646\u062f. \u062d\u062a\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9 \u06a9\u0644\u0645\u0647.", "title": "\u0633\u0648\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0632\u0627\u06a9\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u200c\u0631\u0646\u06af \u0648 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0641\u0631 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u200c\u0627\u0634", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27881003", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1448259972l/27881003.jpg", "reviews": 9061, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3354.Haruki_Murakami", "name": "Haruki Murakami"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9834681._", "name": "\u0645\u0648\u0646\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u06cc\u0646\u06cc"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Asian Literature", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27881003", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288239-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19084385-de-kleurloze-tsukuru-tazaki-en-zijn-pelgrimsjaren", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17622839", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19549052-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23346487-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20582450-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23490582", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18272065-los-a-os-de-peregrinaci-n-del-chico-sin-color", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24637567", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11275.The_Wind_Up_Bird_Chronicle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357575-1q84", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10374.Hard_Boiled_Wonderland_and_the_End_of_the_World"]}
