Granted, we may be a ways off from a future quite so bleak, but as popular entertainments grow ever more cruel, as society falls ever closer to collapse, and as corpses find ever more ways to rise and walk again (bio weapons, solar flares, Joan Rivers, etc), a world in which the poor are forced to fight the dead for the amusement of the rich eventually becomes inevitable!The relationships between the characters are often quite interesting and unexpected, and the bits of backstory peppered throughout provide merciful breaks from the brutal main plot, while at the same time tying it all together. Sure, there's the occasional lapse into wooden description/dialogue, and there are moments where readers might wish for a little more show and a little less tell, but Zombies and Shit delivers on most everything it promises overall.Highly recommended for fans of zombies, shit, Mr. T, Battle Royale, and something called 'the hunger pangs.'"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "[The inclusion of Mr. T as a zombie-killing machine, the T-2000, made me forget all of my gripes with the book every time he made an appearance.

In fact, this book is probably not for 99% of the reading population out there. But for those of you who love fast-paced action, horror, complete saturation of bizarro writing, and laughing-til-you're crying black humor, this is the novel for you. Basically, this is the literary equivalent of watching a Troma Movie - either you love it or you hate it. I loved it... more than most of what I've read this year. I didn't have the highest of expectations as I delved into the first chapter - the characters seemed flat, typical. But by the third or fourth chapter, I was hooked, and the characters were anything but typical. Every one of them had a fascinating background story that interrelated into the others with shocks, twists, and amazement. This book is recommended to anyone with a dark sense of humor or is looking for something unlike anything they've ever read before. Side note: T-2000 is the Best. Character. Ever.Five out of Five stars"}, {"userName": "Ms. Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3291712-ms-nikki", "userReview": "This is only my second foray into the mind of Carlton Mellick lll and it won't be my last. The development of the characters was an amazing treat. Some, of course, were more interesting than others. Oro, the genius, didn't really add anything significant to the story and I felt like speeding through his part. Scavy (my favorite character), Popcorn, Rainbow, and a few others carried the plot from the first page to the last. There was a guest star, Mr. T 2000, who was upper-cutting enemies Mortal Kombat (Jax?) style. Go-Go was a very extreme character who some might not want to read about as she gets down and dirty with the dead. Scavy was one lucky mo-fo and Heinz was relentless in his Aryan agenda even with death looming over him. The character Nemy, maybe because she was actually Nemesis, seemed like a knock-off character of one of my favorite movies, Resident Evil.The writing was above par except for a few mistakes I found. On one page Scavy had a mohawk that was burned off and a few pages later his adversary was grabbing him by said mohawk. The pacing was steady, however, my interest waned at the midway point, but picked back up again. This may have been due to the fact that I didn't feel like the story was progressing. Things were happening, yes. But not to the point where is was a race, which is what I thought would be everyone's motivation: to win and get out fast.I really wish this read would have had more zombie action mixed in with the kill-your-competitors theme as a reader can only takes so much character-overload without some mindlessness to break up the back-stories.Having said all that, Carlton's Zombies and Shit was an unrestrained, excessively extreme, don't-read-this-section-because-you-can't-unread-it bizarro gore-fest.A good story? Yes. Recommended?

Like vampires before them, they are marching into that stale oblivion that we know as the mainstream. It\u2019s a shame really, especially if you were already a fan when the zombie boom hit. Thanks to that boom there are no shortage of books, movies, TV shows, and pop references to the shambling dead. This is both a good and bad thing. Back when zombies were rare, we appreciated them more. Now you have to slog through a lot of plain stuff that just uses on the zombie formulas that are now classic. All so you can find a zombie story of ANY kind that does something truly different and interesting.I say all this because Carlton Mellick\u2019s Zombies and Shit is one of the zombie stories you SHOULD pay attention to. It\u2019s got a strong plot, unique characters, and a setting that provides a nice twist to the zombie apocalypse. It\u2019s set long after the zombie outbreak, and humanity has survived by relocating to an overcrowded island where there is a strict caste system. The people in the Copper Quadrant are surrounded by poverty, disease, and crime. The people in the Platinum Quadrant are ridiculously wealthy and get their kicks watching a reality show Zombie Survival. On this show, twenty citizens from Copper are drugged, kidnapped, and abandoned on the zombie-infested mainland to see who can be the last man standing.The contestants include punks, prostitutes, cyborg mercenaries, a Nazi from the Fifth Reich, a genetically engineered predator, and the T-2000 (with some average joes mixed in for a good body count). Only one of them will be allowed to escape the city and win the contest, so they not only have to beware the zombies, but also each other. Each character has a back story that lets you see who these people are, sometimes right before they\u2019re killed and eaten by zombies. This provides a lot of action and some cool fight scenes, whether it\u2019s between contestants or against zombies. But Zombies and Shit doesn\u2019t just have demented characters competing against one another in a brutal landscape, it\u2019s also got plenty of the undead. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for, right? Well I\u2019m happy to say that Mellick delivers. The zombies here are drippy-fleshed ghouls who cry out for \u201cBraaains!\u201d They puke radioactive slime that will infect you. They prefer to consume brains and nerve tissue before eating regular flesh. They\u2019re similar to the zombies of \u201cReturn of the Living Dead,\u201d but with little extras like plants taking root in the decayed crevices of their bodies, or car parts melded awkwardly to their flesh.Each one-on-one encounter with the zombies is memorable because Mellick makes the dead just as freakish as the living. His talent lies in making ideas that normally wouldn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t work into things that are brilliant and cool. The T-2000 is a prime example of this. I won\u2019t spoil who/what he is, but it\u2019s a ridiculous idea that wouldn\u2019t work for anyone else but CM3. And it turned out to be my favorite part of the book. It\u2019ll be your favorite, too. I guarantee it."}, {"userName": "Shana Festa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185553-shana-festa", "userReview": "When the zombie outbreak caused the collapse of society fifty years ago, Neo New York was formed, along with the four quadrants; Platinum, Gold, Silver & Copper. Copper, home to the dredged of society became easy pickings for the contestant pool of a sick and twisted TV game show. A group of people wake up in the \"Red Zone\" after having been drugged and abducted. Now contestants in the game, they are told by a recorded voice they have three days to navigate to a helicopter that will transport only one person off the mainland and the winner will be granted access to live in the coveted platinum quadrant.Each contestant is provided a bag with food, water, and a weapon. But the weapons are assigned specifically tailored to each contestants fighting prowess. From the irony of a small dagger to rocket launchers, contestants attempt to fight their way to the finish line.Some volunteered themselves, some volunteered someone else and found themselves in the game, and the rest were victims of unfortunate circumstance.A hippie wife and her author husband, an R&D nerd, a scorned game employee, merc punks with gadgets, Mr T (?!), a sexual deviant, a white supremacist, a gang leader and select members of his crew, a lizard mutant girl, a devout Christian, an ego maniacal self-proclaimed genius, an underage prostitute, and a few more are pitted against each other in addition to the most vicious pack of undead I've ever seen. Not to mention the wildly creative cyber zombie dogs, zombie pigs and elephants, smart zombie cars.It's been a while since I've seen zombies begging for brains reminiscent of the 1985 campy Return of the Living Dead. Braaaaaains! Man oh man, did I laugh when one of the zombies began whining for brains in Spanish. Cerebros!Carlton Mellick has a knack for creatively describing zombies. Readers are given living corpses, radioactive corpses, corpses with items melded into their skin after fifty years of no stimulation. Oh, and did I mention Mr. T?!\"When Charlie looks, he sees a naked man staggering through the weed-coated parking lot. His skin has melted off of his body, his face nothing but a skull buried in fluffy pink meat, his intestines wrapped around his neck like a scarf.\"There was only one scene in the book that was too much for me. Reading about the sex/poop activity. I'll leave that to your imaginations. And as you read this and assume you've figured it out, I assure you, you haven't even scratched the surface. I may have vomited in my mouth a bit...just saying.I bow to Mellick's masterful creation. Zombies and Shit fed my need for a down and dirty gore-fest. Chapter after chapter I fell deeper in blood-lust and salivated for more disgusting content. I think I have whiplash from trying to follow all the action. If you think you're reading about a main character...you're wrong, because no one is safe from a disturbingly gruesome death.Zombies and Shit is a jaw dropping experience in which the action never ceases. At 300+ pages! I couldn't stop reading. I kept reading in the car, sitting in the doctors office waiting room, at the grocery store...there was no way I was allowing real life to come between me and my love affair with this book.Five stars on fire isn't enough for this book...I rate this an infinite amount of stars. If I were to be completely blunt, this may very well be the best piece of zombie fiction I have ever read. Not since Iain McKinnon's Demise of the Dead have I had to stop mid-read and shout from the rooftops (or more specifically...shout a tweet) my love for a book.

This is indeed a novel, with prose and shit.The action is set in a decaying city abandoned to the zombie hordes that swept across the country from a U.S. military project run amok. Americans have fortified themselves safely in Neo New York, but society is divided into zones based on socioeconomic status. The punks, prostitutes and criminals are cannon fodder for Zombie Apocalypse, a game show in which 20 combatants are gassed, transported to the city, assigned weapons specific to their talents and given directions to an evacuation site. The first combatant to reach the chopper gets out alive.Contestants include: Charlie, a struggling writer, and Rainbow Cat, his duplicitous wife. Street punks Scavy and Brick and punkettes Popcorn and Gogo. Mercenaries Xiu and her partners Zippo and Vine. Laurence, a hulk with an affinity for '80s TV shows. And a Junko, an Asian model who once hosted Zombie Apocalypse until she crossed the show's producer Wayne \"Wiz\" Rizla and trained herself in survival techniques in lieu of being condemned to die on the show. Gratuitous amounts of sex and violence and shit ensue.Zombies and Shit is slapdash, derivative, loaded with every vice you can imagine and a few I couldn't. It's got a couple of formatting flubs and as many grammatical errors -- not enough to spoil the product, but enough to note this $7.49 e-book was not edited professionally. That actually works in the favor of the book, which is in the spirit of something Melnick wrote in his Trapper Keeper in English class and illustrated while in the back of the school bus. I was about a quarter of the way through when I realized that Melnick's inspiration was not Return of the Living Dead or Battle Royale. That would be aiming too high. Melnick instead turned to Troma Films, VHS kings of the '80s with low budget splatter classics like The Toxic Avenger and Class of Nuke 'Em High, most of which had a certain retro wit and even innocence hidden behind the exploding heads and toxic puke.This is not a book for everybody. This is not The Walking Dead. Melnick steps over the line of good taste a couple of times, but cranked out an e-book with boundless energy and craziness I appreciated. Spanish speaking zombies? Check. An infected character who reanimated as a good zombie? Check. Undead cars? Check. Mr. T? Check. Yes, one of the characters is not who he seems to be and pities the fool who doesn't remember his name!I'm not a fan of joke based books, but Melnick didn't write down to the supposed intelligence of his reader here. He never gets satisfied with himself and manages to avoid the smarminess of a jokester laughing at his own supposed wit. Much of the writing is deplorable, as much of the writing and a good deal of the acting in Toxic Avenger was deplorable. Amid all this dreck, Melnick sneaks in the qualities of friendship, loyalty and love. He stays ahead of the reader, willing to kill any character in the gnarliest manner possible. And he cranks up the post-apocalyptic action and zombie carnage to 9. I'd be curious to see what he can do with an editor and decent cover designer."}, {"userName": "Tabitha Rowland", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5969583-tabitha-rowland", "userReview": "**4.5 Stars**I love zombies. I love dystopian worlds, plagued with oppression, hardships, and people trying to survive. I love survival horror. And I love weird.So it\u2019s not surprising that I really enjoyed this book. The rich are bored. They are protected, well taken care of, and do not have to fear the hordes of zombies out in the Red Zone. So how do you amuse them? Take people from the Copper district (the slums, basically) and put them onto a T.V. show. Film them trying to survive, and to be the last to make it to the helicopter.Problem is, the show is getting repetitive, and contestants are dying off too quickly. Sometimes, the helicopter doesn\u2019t get a chance to pick up a winner.But this season is going to change. It HAS to, if they want to keep the ratings up and the upper class happy. So when these select twenty survivors wake up and realize they have been chosen for the show, they get to work on trying to survive. Put in genetically modified people, a nazi, punks, mercenaries, and those desperate to get out of the Copper district, this book is as fun as it is unpredictable. I liked this style of \u201cweird\u201d. I was able to understand the characters, their weird personality quirks, and the unique spin on the zombie virus.So why 4.5 instead of a full 5? Because although it was a great book, and incredibly entertaining, it\u2019s not the best of the zombie books I have read and do not want to lump it with the ones that touched me the most.Hmm, maybe 4.75?Oh well, just know that I recommend this for those that like odd zombie stories and have a fun and open personality!"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4882131-chris", "userReview": "For a little while now I had been sitting on the fence if I liked CM3's work, the first book I had read of his was really good, then it was a slow downhill ride through the next couple. Being a HUGE fan of anything dealing with death games, the description caught my attention, and I figured I would have a go at it.The first thing I noticed was that this was the first full length novel I had seen from him, damn near three hundred pages of small type set, not the BS that was Menstruating Mall (hyper large type set, the book is a short story).The back of the book blurb is \"Battle Royale meets Return of the Living Dead\", well that really is the most appropriate way to describe it...It was fantastic! Really, I enjoyed this so very much, it was just what the doctor ordered!Trashy, violent, chock full of uncomfortable sex, surprise cameo (what's up with bizarro having this? What is the reaction from the people in the book? (has Shatner read Shatnerquake?))I was pleasantly surprised by the way the charas were tied to, and balanced with each other. This showed allot of depth, consideration, and maturity in the writing, okay maybe lots of immaturity.. But still this was so different from some of the stuff I had read from him before.The zombies were a true treat, the damn near indestructible type in homage to RotLD, with a loving touch of detail that tied them into their reality. The charas were the type you wanted to see in this kind of story, completely over the top. After all, if you are going to be present for one of these games, it better be the best one ever played!I would like to continue to gush over this book, but I guess all I have to say is that if the blurb is in anyway interesting to you, go ahead and read this, you will not be disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1951295-craig", "userReview": "This is the first book I had read by author Carlton Mellick III (CM3) and I had been put off by the title before but am I glad that I have read it now and will be looking for more books by this author.[return][return]The book is similar in story to Battle Royale - but more futuristic and with a lot more zombies. But the author doesn't stop there - he works hard to make sure that the whole story is entertaining and that even the zombies within his book are unique.

For a while there, I thought the ending would be tragic, but it turned out to be epically awesome.My favourite character turned out to be Scavy, followed quite closely by T-2000.

But I'm sick of the same zombie story over and over and over and over and over again.Well, to you who thinks much like I do, I present you with Zombies and Shit. It's the story of a misfit group of people in a dystopian future thrown into a game of survival in the middle of a post Z-Day zombie wasteland America. There's a lot that either hasn't been seen before (zombie cars, yes, cars) and things that aren't seen often (indestructible Return of the Living Dead style zombies). You name the far fetched idea, it's probably in here. Existing fans of CM3 won't be surprised by the sheer storytelling mastery he uses here to throw together cybernetics, sex with zombies, iconic 80's action stars, genetic mutations and so so much more.I am a long time Mellick fan. I'd say everything he writes is entertaining (if not for everyone), but this is a love letter to zombie movies the same way Apeshit was his love letter to slasher movies.

I\u2019ve read a couple of Brian Keene\u2019s, I\u2019ve read some shorts. In the introduction of Zombies and Stuff CM3 talks about being hesitant to write about zombies, really they are getting over done. But I for one am glad that he decided to write this book, it freakin rocked! Set in a post apocalyptic future devastated by a zombie plague we are introduced to twenty individuals as they awaken to find themselves as participants on the game show Zombie Survival. Much like the Manga Battle Royale it\u2019s a fight to the death as there can be only one winner of the show. Some characters prefer to work together, some choose to destroy any they see along the way to victory. But they all have to deal with an endless horde of zombies, and the best of all it\u2019s the Return of the Living Dead style zombies. Nobody uses those zombies, but here there are plenty of them hungry for brains.CM3 gives us a back-story on each of the contestants and what brought them to Zombie Survival.

But I'm sure the others aren't anything like this. First off, it's about a reality show that's set up to be a sort of \"Battle Royale\" set in a zombie apocalypse. Then there's the social class differences in the post-apocalyptic culture. Then there's the zombie apocalypse back story. Then there's the zombie fetish porn. It's incredibly brutal. I was really disgusted at several points during the book. But it's just so insane, from the ridiculously outlandish concept, Mellick carves a really distinct, unique zombie story. Highly engaging. It won't disappoint zombie fans or bizarro fans, or the gore addicts who just love some really crazy, crazy junk. It's also great for Battle Royale fans too.

I would agree that this is a fair assessment of this book in several ways. It also includes what I assume are aspects of The Hunger Games and possibly the Terminator movies.The book starts much in the manner of Battle Royale with people being gassed and waking up to be informed that they must now survive one another and the survivor will be returned home. The survivor will also move onto a better standard of living. To make it more difficult, the survivors must also fend off nearly indestructable zombies (much like those in ROTLD).The next Battle Royale similarity comes in the equipping of the contestants. They are each given a back pack containing a weapon and other provisions to aid them in the contest.Unlike Battle Royale, the competition is being televised and robot cameras hover around to film the contestants.Many plot twists are added as the story progresses. Some are interesting. Some are ridiculous. I suppose this is all because it is what is considered \"bizarro\" fiction. With this being my first bizarro reading, I can only assume that bizarro means that the stories should become complete ludicrous from time to time. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's my take on it thus far. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.Anyway, the zombies are much like ROTLD zombies. They move quickly and speak. They mostly request the brains of the humans in whatever language they speak, but do say some other things from time to time. The zombies mostly want brains, but eat other parts as well. These are your really good teeth zombies who are somehow able to bite through human skulls. Oh well. Biting through skulls is more believable than some of the other things heaped at readers in zombie films and literature.The zombies infect not only through bites, but by puking up some type of green vomit. I guess this makes them a combo of ROTLD zombies and 28 Days Lated infected in this manner.I must say, I liked this at first and then started to dislike it a few chapters into it. Later, I began to enjoy it again. Well, I might say less enjoy than want to see how everything tied together.The story amused me at times. It entertained me at times as well. Unfortunately, I find it hard to follow in some places and was annoyed by some attempts by the author to be offensive.In some ways, I felt this might be what it would be like if Chuck Palahniuk wrote a zombie novel. I got the idea that the author was going out of his way to be disgusting at times. If that's his thing, that's his thing. All in all, this didn't leave me dying to read more of Mellick's work. I am not totally against giving him or bizarro fiction another chance. It just isn't anywhere near the top of my reading lists. Zombie completists and fans of the strange should check this out.

I was reeled in by the zombies - I'm a big, big fan - and the fact that I'm kind of circlejerking about Mellick lately, but it turned out to satisfy me in a lot of other ways. I got my fix of zombie gore, obviously, but there was a whole lot fucking more lurking between the covers of this goddamn masterpiece.let's start with backstory. fucking backstory. every single character had a beautifully crafted, well thought out backstory, even insignificant motherfuckers or people that I hated. that's something that's rare even in \"normal\" books. and then world building - dear lord, the world that Mellick strung together holds it own against even the most popular of dystopias, the most overhyped of books. everything had a reason, a good one and,perhaps most importantly for the zombie genre: a unique one. I can't say enough about how fucking perfect this book was.if you're not squeamish (although admittedly, this isn't even that gross; there's some mild scat and some semi-graphic zombie/human sex, but it's nowhere near as bad as apeshit, in my opinion,) this is something that you not only should read, it's something that you damn near have to.if I ever rule the world, this shit will be fucking required reading. five stars does not feel like enough."}, {"userName": "Gunne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1925634-gunne", "userReview": "Battle Royale with zombies, as adequately described by Mellick himself. This is by far the longest novel he's written, if I'm not wrong, and I like it very much because it gave me time to get to know the characters. I have to say I felt more attached to them compared to most of the characters he's written, aside from just rooting for them. However, I think there's a lot more potential for Mellick to make his characters really loveable. I like them enough, but when bad things happen, it's \"aw shucks\" for 3 seconds and let's move on with the plot! I'm not asking for crazy emotional scenes, and I do understand the lack of focus on secondary characters that exist only as zombie fodder, but there were a few moments I wish were a little more drawn out.Now, don't get me wrong, Mellick is great with plots, like I've mentioned a thousand times before, but it's time he challenged himself to writing something kick-ass, original, and *impactfully heartfelt* at the same time. Maybe it's a lot to demand, but if anyone's capable enough, it's Mellick. It gets a little frustrating to see the arcs not fully realised, even though it's just an inch short! That said, this book was reaaaally action-packed, a blast to read, quite the page turner, and I enjoyed it as much as Crab Town. Mellick has a talent for explaining away far-fetched concepts, making them believable. There were a few times when characters said something, and I was like, \"But I thought you said...\" and then the question gets throughly blown away because he gives a good, sound explanation in the next paragraph. These plot devices are weirdly logical in their frames of insanity!"}, {"userName": "Sandpiper", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4388439-sandpiper", "userReview": "Have you ever had a kid tell you something and he gets really excited and starts making up stuff along the way? That's what reading this book was like. \"And then this happened and then this, and oh yeah! this too, and...\" *sigh*I was excited to read this, but that excitement quickly turned to disappointment the more I read. I wasn't expecting a literary masterpiece, but I was expecting something half-way readable. I've read a few books with damned-awful writing, but the story saved it. But the writing and execution for this book was just so bad that nothing could save this book for me. Nothing. Not even the awesome story idea.The Good:- The premise. Zombies + Survival-type Reality TV. Sounds good, right? Not so much with this book.The Bad & The Ugly:- The. Writing. Is. Very. Choppy. and in many places the clumsy are the sentences, I mean the sentences are clumsy.- All telling, no showing, which leads to long, boring (...zZZZZzz...) uh, where was I? Oh yeah, long boring info dumps, which could've been tolerable if the writing wasn't extremely bland.Excerpt:\"He became friends with Scavy the day Scavy and his crew tried to mug him.

La societ\u00e0 adesso \u00e8 divisa in quattro quadranti e quelli in fondo alla gerarchia sono selezionabili per partecipare a un terribile reality tv show in cui non solo i concorrenti devono sopravvivere agli zombie, ma devono anche uccidersi a vicenda perch\u00e9 solo uno pu\u00f2 uscirne vincitore.Non mi piacciono gli zombie, ma non sono nuovo alla Bizarro Fiction e adoro gli scenari alla Battle Royale/The Hunger Games. In teoria Zombies and Shit sarebbe dovuto essere il mio libro preferito di Mellick, in pratica non lo trovo pi\u00f9 divertente. Ci pu\u00f2 stare che abbia perso il gusto per lo scanzonato delirio che \u00e8 un po' il suo marchio di fabbrica, ma ci sta anche che a una certa mi sia stufato dei continui infodump mascherati da flashback, della sciatteria mascherata da stile lineare, dei colpi di scena beceri palesemente inventati sul momento e degli zombie che partono all'attacco urlando \u00abBraaains!\u00bb solo quando bisogna muovere la storia in avanti.Quello che Mellick non ha capito \u00e8 che la forza di Battle Royale \u00e8 in personaggi umani costretti a uccidersi per sopravvivere, mentre il poco di umano che hanno i suoi personaggi \u00e8 fin troppo caricaturale e grossolano per farti venire voglia di tifare per qualcuno. La fantasia non gli manca, ma per me Zombies and Shit \u00e8, come da titolo, un po' una merda."}, {"userName": "Tabitha", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4446517-tabitha", "userReview": "Heads up to those with a delicate stomach! \u2013 This zombie book steps over the edge of graphic and a few times into the realms of disgusting!This is one of the strangest books I have yet to read, with that said I got a huge flipping kick out of it! If you think you can handle some really crazy stuff and you are jonsezing for some zombie action \u2013 you should definitely give this book a try. It is a quick action packed read.One of the things I loved about this book was the photo roster at the beginning of the book (and throughout the book). It shows you thumbnail black and white sketches of all 20 zombie survivalists. As you progress through the book it shows you the photo roster again a handful of times with the people that have had their goose cooked blacked out. An important thing to note is this book swaps points of view almost every chapter to a different character. One moment you think you know what is going to happen but the fact of the matter is \u2013 you really just can\u2019t \u2013 not with this author Mellick.Some of this had me laughing out loud, while a few short bits had me biting back the bile rising in my throat. I think it gives you a real glimpse into what could potentially happen if the zombie crud were to really hit the fan. It\u2019s sick, twisted, with dark humor and a few unexpected heartwarming moments. This goes way beyond gritty. I highly recommend it to the veteran zombie fan who is in need of something new!"}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3983118-frank", "userReview": "ZOMBIES AND SHIT by Carlton Mellick is one of the most unique zombie stories you could ever hope to read. It's surprising too because at first glance this story would seem to harness every cliche the zombie genre can throw at it. Yet powered by Mellick one of a kind writing voice it is nothing but original and new.ZOMBIE AND SHIT features an ensemble cast. There are punks, nazis, nerds, hippies, robots and Mr. T (no kidding.) The zombie say \"Brains!\" and it doesn't come accross as corny. Like every great zombie book, the story is about the living and not the dead.The story does have the feel of The Running Man. It is centered around a reality game show. This is all action. The amount of characters does not muddle the story. Mellick is masterful at managing the characters and keeping the flow of the story fast paced without confusing things.ZOMBIES AND SHIT easily ranks in my top 5 zombie books of all time. This is the first Carlton Mellick story I've read. He reputation precedes him and he did live up to all the hype. I can't wait to get into more Mellick and I recommend this as a great starting place for anyone wanting to check him out."}, {"userName": "Pedro Proen\u00e7a", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23340044-pedro-proen-a", "userReview": "The best CMCIII book I've read (so far), \"Zombies and Shit\" is the ultimate zombie novel.Set in a post zombie apocalypse world, the story narrates the struggle of 20 people taken from the Copper quadrant (the poorest one in Neo New York) to participate in a \"Battle Royale\"-type reality show, where they have to fight each other, as well as hordes of zombies, to win a upgrade in life: Moving to the Silver Quadrant, and gaining passport to visit the Gold and Platinum quadrants.This novel is Bizarro at it's best: Strange sex scenes, ultraviolence, futuristic concepts introduced in conveniently righ times. But it's also one of the most emotionally-infused zombie stories I've ever read. You end up rooting for multiple characters, despite knowing that for one to win, the others have to lose. It's really emotional, you feel sad when a beloved character dies, even if the description of his or hers death is \"Bizarro-like\".

I can definitely feel that exuberance coming off every page of 'Zombies and Shit'. Mellick writes with the intensity of a manic six-grader gleefully plotting out his detailed zombie apocalypse fantasy (i'm with him, by the way - Return of the Living Dead-style zombies are WAY underrepresented in the zombie canon). Just when you think the book has hit a ceiling in how big, how ridiculous, how utterly weird it can be, it one-ups itself with flamethrower Nazis, zombie cunnilingus, or robot-zombie-Mr. T. Despite all of the book's flaws (mediocre writing quality, a deus ex machina ending and an overreliance on the trope of cutting a character's death scene with flashbacks into their backstory), the whole experience is much more enjoyable and readable then the sum of it's parts. Somehow, it just works. Anybody looking to get into the whole 'bizarro' genre (and really, what are you waiting for) could do far, far worse then to start here."}, {"userName": "Da$h", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9488672-da-h", "userReview": "I.Take Battle Royale, add few pinches of Return of the Living Dead, Dragon Ball Z, A-Team, Mad Max, Terminator, some Scat + CP Porn and to conclude, don't forget to trow in a few crazy Japanese video games.II.Put everything into a blender to a half prefilled with liquid PCP and mix until all ingredients blended into one homogeneous mass.III.When done, add on top a layer of pulverized crack cocaine and a layer of A-grade meth crystals for a nice shiny look.Congratulations! \"Zombies and Shit\" is done and ready for consumption.Zombies and Shit by Carlton Mellick III was my first excursion into the Bizarro genre and i don't think that i'll be coming back for more.Call me crazy, but for some reason i like it when books make at least some sense and when the writing style doesn't constantly reminds you on your 10 y.o. nephew on a sugar trip.If you like crazy and entertaining stories, I would suggest trying Christopher Moore's books instead.P.S.Brian Keene tricked me into reading this book."}, {"userName": "Melissa Bennett", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3860127-melissa-bennett", "userReview": "I wasn't real impressed by this story. This is my 2nd bizarro book and at the same time my 2nd Carlton Mellick book. I enjoyed the first book I read of his called The Cannibals of Candyland. This one, not so much. It was like a cross between Hunger Games and Running Man with zombies in it. Sounds cool but there was not a lot of originality to it. I really didn't care for a whole lot of the characters either. I mostly liked reading about the Merc Punks, Laurence and Scavy. The others were just okay. I don't mind reading stuff that is gross, dark or horrid to an extent. I have a high tolerance for most part. This book went a little over the tolerance level for me though. I do not care to read about pedophilia or incest. That is probably were I draw the line and wished it was kept out of this book. With that and the mediocre story line, and not too enjoyable characters I would have to say the book is just okay.

Their goal: be the first to make it through the zombie-plagued city to the pick-up zone alive. But because there's only one seat available on the helicopter, the contestants not only have to fight off the hordes of the living dead, they must also fight each other. Zombies and Shit is Mellick's craziest book to date. A campy, trashy, punk rock gore fest that is as funny as it is brutal, as sad as it is strange.
