Well, he also wrote other, exceptionally good books.The walking Stick is one of my all time favourites. It's a slim volume so I have to be careful not to give too much of the plot away. The story revolves around a young woman who uses a walking stick. As the story unfolds we discover that her withered leg is due to having been ill as a child with polio and she now hates confined spaces because she spent so much time in an iron lung. This in itself might make us pity her, but when we witness her having breakfast at home with her two stuffy parents and discover that they are both doctors...suddenly we realise that she's an embarassment to them; and that her disability is as crippling to them as to her.Into her restricted, solitary life, appears a young man. He flirts, she falls in love, something she never thought possible. After all, who would find a cripple attractive?Written in 1967 the book is set against the fast paced life of the swinging sixities with all of its seedy undercurrants. The reader is immediately transported to the hub of 60s life and shown the stark contrast beween the parents' properness and the laid back beetnik culture; a freer way of living that beguiles an unhappy young woman into falling in love with a man who may not be all he claims to be."}, {"userName": "LemonLinda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1541888-lemonlinda", "userReview": "Winston Graham writes this mystery/thriller almost as a social commentary on English society. It is written in the 1960s and the main character is handicapped as a polio survivor. She is one of three daughters in a somewhat unemotional family of all doctors, but she rejected the preferred family career path and works instead at a Christie's type auction house. So she has daily access to priceless antiques, beautiful jewels, etc. Enter a young man that she meets at a party at her sister's house who immediately is attracted to her and no matter many times she ignores him or rejects him, he continues his pursuit. And so the question arises as to why he will not take no for an answer. His determination for a relationship is seemingly beyond the norm and why would that be? Is it simply because it was love at first sight, is he one of those who has a fetish for a handicap or is it because of her connection to the auction house. It turns out that he comes from quite a different economic and social background and has a connection to a shady element. So questions arise. Will he win her favor? If so, where will that lead them? And how will she extricate herself from their influence? This is a great mystery where things don't necessarily turn out as expected. It is a quick and easy read, but one that makes you think over and beyond."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "Sometimes I woke in the middle of the night and said, you fool, you twisted little beast; and the man beside me was asleep, a heavy young man, solid limbed, white limbed, gentle handed, kind mouthed; so I said, well, the it is, you traded love for integrity....And what is integrity? Can you feel it, can you taste it, as you can feel and taste love?To whom anyway did I fundamentally owe any loyalty except to Leigh? And I would turn over and try to hold his hand, as if that were the only thing in a world that didn't seem to have a lot of certainty any more."}, {"userName": "David Linzee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49718184-david-linzee", "userReview": "This is one of those rare suspense novels that manages to be compelling reading without a murder...without any physical violence at all. (There's plenty of emotional violence.) It's a tale of psychological suspense that brings to mind Henry James, especially \"Washington Square\" in the richness and ambiguity of the characters and their motives. It has also, by now, acquired interest as a portrait of London just before it began to swing. If you only know Graham from the Poldark novels or their TV adaptations, this can serve as an introduction to his fine suspense novels."}, {"userName": "Naomi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1148175-naomi", "userReview": "Deborah Dainton has built a very quiet life for herself being a trusted and highly skilled employee of an auction house.

I was partly attracted to the title as I'm a disabled woman who grew up in the 1960s. Like some of the other reviewers, I felt frustrated that Deborah was so gullible. However, I also recognised that disability was viewed in a very different way compared to today. Although she is beautiful and intelligent, her confidence is very superficial because of her withered leg and Leigh gets behind her defences as she falls in love with him. What I found interesting was that although early on I guessed what was going to happen, the story was still gripping. I wasn't quite so convinced by her behaviour at the height of the drama!! (I shan't give any more away). A thoroughly good read."}, {"userName": "Helena", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34195481-helena", "userReview": "Una sorpresa que encont\u00e9 en una librer\u00eda de usados tirada, literalmente, en el piso que no dejo que la suelte en todos estos d\u00edas.
