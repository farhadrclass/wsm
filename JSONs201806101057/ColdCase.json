Luckily, Cold Case (not to be confused with my favorite TV show on CBS of the same title) was an exception. Emotional, intense, suspenseful and riveting, this story begins as a murder mystery and soon turns out to involve government corruption, nuclear secrets, family drama and good old fashioned detective work."}, {"userName": "Hector Bustos", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59926035-hector-bustos", "userReview": "Imagine a 13-year-old boy finding a dead man's body in his family's restaurant. The genre of this book is mystery. I especially liked this book because of how it leaves the reader with suspense at the end of every chapter.  13- year-old Austin \"Oz\" Keiller spends his Saturday mornings clean the house because of his older brother, Dave. On Saturday he notices that his older brother, Dave is not home he figures he is at his family's restaurant in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Oz leaves the house arrives at Chez Isabelle (The Name of the family's restaurant). Immediately he notices something is wrong. The door at Chez Isabelle is open and there is blood on the kitchen counter. Oz then checks the walk-in refrigerator and finds the dead body of a man named Aaron Sneider. The Police arrives at the scene and take Oz and Dave to the police. Where Oz finds out that his father was accused of selling nuclear secrets to rogue governments. Oz is furious that his family did not tell him about this before. After that Dave is taken into custody and charged with murder. It is now up to Oz to clear his brother's name and crack the case. The 1st person point of view affects the story because if the story was not in 1st person the reader would not be able to relate to the emotions that Oz was felling. One major event that changed the story was that when Oz walked into the walk in refrigerator and found Aaron Sneider's dead body. The narrator (Oz) is a reliable source because he witnessed all these events happen and experienced all of them. A major symbol in the book is Aaron Sneider's dead body because when they police find the body, Dave is taken into custody and charged with murder and it is now up to Oz to clear his brother's name. The Character motivation is his father because Oz is determined to clear his brother's name and find out who his father really was. I was surprised when Oz found Aaron's dead body in the fridge. I was angry about how Oz had found a note in Aaron Sneider's T-Shirt pocket when he and Dave were at the police station and said nothing. The note said, \" D. Keiller Fri night-midnight. Use back door.\" I liked the way the author describes how Oz was feeling at the police station where he finds out who his father was. My Favorite part in the book was when Oz finds out that his father was a scientist selling nuclear secrets to rogue governments. Cold Case was a good title for this book because it re-opens his father's case and Oz tries to solve it before it is too late.  I would rate this book 4 stars out of 5 because it kind didn't make sense that Oz's mother was away on a trip and Oz's and Dave were by themselves with the police and the case and everything and the police never even asked where the parents were. I would recommend this book to my mom because she likes reading Mystery/Suspense books. So, I think this is a good book for her. What would you do if you found a dead body in your fridge? Would you keep it a secret or spill the beans right away? The choice is yours."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/837162-angie", "userReview": "I love a good murder mystery, so when I was offered this one for review (THANK YOU) I of course said sure.Things I Liked:1)The relationships around Oz (the main character)--he and his brother Dave, he and his best friend Rusty, he and fellow restaurant employee Razor. They all rang true in terms of how they communicated and got along.2)The history of Los Alamos and descriptions of Santa Fe.3)The descriptions of how a kitchen runs. Not that I cook but still ... it made sense and seemed like it really was a young teen explaining it all.4)Totally doable for a middle grade murder mystery. Enough detail that the kids will be intrigued but not so much that we have to worry about freaking them out. Who knows which houses allow CSI and which don't.Things I Think Will Get Even Better with More Middle Grade Mystery Novels:1)I don't think (wouldn't know for sure, would I?) bad guys explain everything. Mentally going through in my head ... and I just really don't think they do. Will consider more specific examples but the way the final ending plays out was just a little bit contrived.2)The mother is pretty absent and I'm not sure why. Doesn't have to be that way ... even to get Oz over to Rusty's house more often.3)Perhaps narrowing down the suspect pool just a bit. There are a couple characters in the story who's only real job seems to be red herring. A little misdirection is fun. Too much and it starts to wear on the credibility of the story.All in all ... a solid entry. If I could give three point five or even three point seven five I would. Will definitely watch for more from this author. Not a huge fan of the cover (running seemed to be more important to him) but I can see the vibe they were going for. With booktalking I can think of at least a couple fifth graders who will enjoy this one, and definitely sixth or seventh graders. Another reviewer here on Goodreads mentioned they enjoyed this one more than Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer and I would agree. Was thinking the same thing before I even saw that comment."}, {"userName": "Zaziz3", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35486803-zaziz3", "userReview": "Thirteen-year-old Oz Keillor wants nothing more but to work at his family's restaurant and become a successful chef someday, but things take an unexpected turn when Oz finds a dead journalist in the kitchen of their restaurant early one Saturday morning, and soon discovers that his brother might have murdered the journalist over an old family vendetta involving his now dead father and some pretty nasty secrets. Shocked at his very own family for keeping such secrets and lying all these years, Oz soon turns to his rebellious friend, Rosy, who can hopefully help him clear the smoke, sort through the lies and figure out who exactly killed this journalist in an attempt to clear his brother's name. Then, as Oz and Rosy soon discover, they must question the trust of their closest friends to clear up the red herrings preventing them from solving the mystery. They learn that even their so-called friends might not be so friendly any longer; Cold Case is about determination, trust and betrayal."}, {"userName": "Phoebe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2807810-phoebe", "userReview": "Oz and his friend Rusty find themselves in a strange new world when Oz discovers a body in his family's restaurant, and Dave, Oz's brother, is arrested for murder. Oz's mother is in France, and the list of adults Oz can turn to is short. He and Rusty embark upon their own investigation since the police seem to think it's an open and shut case. What connection did the murdered man have with Dave, and with Oz's dad, once a scientist at Los Alamos, uncovered as a spy, and dead before Oz was born?

Not the kind of place you'd find a dead body. But 13-year-old Austin \"Oz\" Keiller finds just that. A dead body in his family's restaurant, Chez Isabelle, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. ***SPOILER ALERT*** He finds a clue that could put his brother, Dave, at #1 on the suspect list: A note saying to meet After going to the police station for an interview, he learns that Dave and mother have kept a terrible secret from him: The fact that his late father was accused of selling rogue governments nuclear secrets about Los Alamos, a secret nuclear base. Also, another clue might show that Dave is the killer: The victim, Aaron Sneider, was writing a book called \"Traitor\" about Oz's dad. Later on, after visiting his brother's lawyer, Archie, (Full name: Archibald McCallister.) he meets up with a friend of Dave's, Razor, and after that, Oz meets up with his best friend, and forensics junkie, Rusty, who, the day before, her parents dragged her to Los Alamos for no-nuke protests. The two friends decide to go to Sneider's room, at the Silver Dollar Motel, to poke around for clues. The only thing they find is an envelope with a picture in it, showing 3 men, Oz's father, and 2 others. However, Oz makes a mistake: The pair brought flashlights, and Oz forgot his at the room. After that, they meet up again, and discuss clues, but this happened after Dave got arrested for killing Aaron Sneider. The big clue that got him arrested was the fact that his personal knife had Dave's fingerprints only on it. To me, this means, if there was another killer, he would've worn gloves to not have his fingerprints on it. While they talked, Oz phoned Jake Whitetower, and tells him his \"name,\" which is Mac Macintosh. During the talk on the phone, to Rusty's dismay, Oz promised an interview.  When Oz arrived at school afterward, everyone was whispering about the Chez Isabelle murder, which made Oz a little paranoid. Oz gets to the library--he's not a regular there, so the librarian gave him a funny look. He made his way to a computer area in the back of the library. Rusty, of course, is there. She has a picture, the one from Sneider's room, opened on the screen, and Oz thinks she's showing it to everyone--but Rusty says they're the only ones there. Rusty apparently made an account on a blog named \"High Altitude\" and posted a comment saying that \"High Altitude\" was looking for the other 2 men in the photo. She tells a comment to Oz--someone commented on it saying that they were alien abductees. After a while, someone comments saying that David Keiller died, but he doesn't know the guy in the middle. He also tells them of \"A.J. Powell,\" who worked with David, had left the lab back in the 1990s. The person who made the comment thinks he's in Santa Fe. Rusty searched public records--and found 4 A.J. Powells. After a while, they possibly find the correct A.J. Powell. When they open the gate, someone yells \"ATAQUE,\" which in Spanish means \"ATTACK.\" A German Shepherd raced after Rusty and Oz. Rusty froze on the spot, looking like she was letting the dog try to kill her. After a while, the same person that said \"ATAQUE\" yells \"BASTA,\" which calms the dog down. The only kind of injury-related pain was inflicted on Rusty, when she had fell on the ground, her arm had a few scratches. The person--the correct A.J. Powell-- tells them the dog's name is Rio. Oz asks if Rusty was okay, who nods. They give him the picture. Of course, he asks where they got it. Oz lies and says they cleaned out some boxes and found it. (Just saying, this is one long book.) After a while, they left, but weren't any closer to figuring out if Dad was innocent or not. From what I've seen on TV shows, the primary sentence (Time in jail.) if your convicted of murder is 95% of the time life without parole. If David was convicted, he could get that much time in jail. On Tuesday, after Oz sleeps at Rusty's house, her dad drives Oz to Water Street, 2 blocks from the plaza. He is still wondering where one of David's friends, I think, Carlos, is. He sees Archie and walks over time him. Archie owns a 1971 vintage Mercedez-Benz 280SL Convertible. Oz and Razor were texting each other in the process. Archie takes Oz to the Santa Fe Correctional Facility. After talking with David, who was being held there, Detective Suarez says 2 people murdered Aaron Sneider--1 kept him pinned down and the other...well, jabbed a knife into him a bunch of times. After he's dead, one hid Aaron's body crudely in the walk-in freezer, the other threw Dave's knife away. After this, he met Harrison Smith. The two talked about--you might not have guessed it, but did--the murder. After the talk, Harrison drops Oz off at Chez Isabelle. At first, he wanted to get there like Sonic the Hedgehog, but now, he sorta didn't. Dave wanted Oz to open the restaurant and keep business running smoothly. Razor comes, and talks with Oz. During the talk, Oz phones Rusty. After they talk, Oz and Razor set up the restaurant. At school on Wednesday, Rusty considers the possibility that the killer, or killers, injured himself on the knife, during the stabbing. After having a Mexican meal afterward, they find out, in the middle of the picture, is the late Victor Martinez. They meet up at his wife's home. Apparently she was acting very rudely, or was ticked off, because they acted a bit rude to Rusty and Oz. They find out later Victor died in a car accident. Also, before they left the wife's home, Archie visits her. When Oz gets home, his door is opened, picked open. Inside, the place is like a tornado just spawned inside his home and was ripped to basic shreds. Afterward, a car literally crashes into the house, injuring Oz, but not badly. Afterward, he goes to Rusty's. Oz explains what happened, while Rusty is trying to treat his wounds. After a talk, he talks to Harrison on the phone. They decide to meet each other on Thursday, at 7:00. Rusty pleads to go, but Oz refuses. After being ticked off about it, Oz leaves on her bike. During the talk with Harrison, Harrison reveals the police are at A.J. Powell's. He barricaded his house and rigged it to blow--and he's holding a young girl hostage. Oz says he has Rusty. All of this. This all...I'm not going to tell you yet. They go to Powell's house. Harrison enters it, and later, 2 gunshots are heard. Oz rushes inside--Powell is dead, a gun near him. Suicide, right? NOT. Harrison killed Powell and faked his suicide. There's now no witnesses but Rio. Afterward, Harrison reveals the biggest shock in the book--***SPOILER ALERT. BIG ONE.***--Harrison killed Sneider. Harrison threatens Oz that if he runs away, he'll kill Oz. However, Oz comes up with a plan--he screams \"ATAQUE\" 2 times, and Rio pounced on Harrison. Rusty wasn't there. Harrison lied all along. The young girl being a hostage? All fiction. Harrison used Rusty as a bait to get Oz to go there. Within minutes, cops swarmed the house's area. Oz escapes the scene, however, he didn't know one thing: Witnesses getting awake from a crime scene itself is a broken law. After Suarez calls him and talks to him about it, he goes to Chez Isabelle. ***NOTE: DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANNA BE SPOILED.*** Oz goes to Chez Isabelle to look for Rusty. Razor's car was parked there. After a short part, it escalates into something else: a murder(?) Razor orders Oz on the ground and ties his hands with plastic wrap. Then Razor reveals the truth after Oz agrees to comply with him: Razor murdered Sneider. He had acted with Harrison too, but Razor was the only one at the murder. He told Oz why he pinned the murder on Dave: Dave never stopped reminding Razor how much he was better than him, and that \"pinning this on Dave was the only good thing that came out of it. Oz realizes that Razor is going to kill him. Then, the biggest surprise occurs: Soon after Razor pushed Oz to the walk-in freezer, (Where Aaron Sneider's corpse was.) Rusty opens a door and, when she realizes what happens, run off. Later, cops burst straight through the door. Razor was on the ground in an instant and handcuffed. Later, Oz goes to talk with Rusty. Rusty tells Oz what occurred: Because she was angry, she decided to hitch a ride to Los Alamos with her parents. She went to the library there, too. After a short part of it, Rusty explains she went to Chez Isabelle because Oz was always there. After the conversation ends, Dave is released. Oz thought Dad was innocent. Dave thought he was guilty. After a talk, the book ends. Personally, I thought this was a 5 star book. I'd reccomend this to anyone who likes crime books and crime novels."}, {"userName": "Devin Logan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23083864-devin-logan", "userReview": "Imagine be a 13-yr. old boy, with a life that seems to be normal for what you know. Until you go to the family restaurant early one Saturday morning and are horrified by the sight that you see. The back door light is busted out, the back door is unlocked with no signs of forced entry, and there is such an errie feeling in your body. Then, when you turn on the lights you see something you couldn't have imagined would be there in a million years. Blood! That is what happened to Oz Keiler. He went to go prepare the family rstaurant, Chez Isabelle, for another day of buisness. But when he went to go prep clean he found in the freezer a dead man. Thinking that someone else did the murder, all the clues at the time pointed to his big brother, Dave, the head chef, doing the murder. But determined and relentless, Oz would do anything to find the true murderer.So Oz and his friend, Rusty go all around the Santa Fe area looking for clues and leads that would help them in the murder. Unlike anyone else, Oz and Rusty don't just leave the investigation in the Police's hands, they take it into their own. The two talk to various people trying to find clues and information until one story pops up, Oz's dad. Oz's father's story would lead them to many clues and files about the murder case . They would run into various people and Los ALamos Nuclear PLant files and records. But unlike some, Oz is very curious. He never knew his dad, so he was detrmined to find out if his dad had anything to do with the case.A 13-yr. old boy full of curiosity and smarts goes to every limit and barrier he can to get to the botttom of this murder case. But young Oz would soon find out a lesson about the people in Santa Fe. He would learn that soon enough that \" curiosity kills the cat.\"No one would expect the twist the book would take and the journey it would lead the reader on. But this book can truly teach people to always, always know someone to the fullest before you trust them. Although some would take advantage of young, naive, Oz he would truly outwit them.The author created an amazing book about a curious boy who never gives up on finding the truth! He faces lots of obstacles and plenty of danger but prevails through it all to get to the truth. I believe the book had a greater effect because she put a young, persistent, and unwilling to give up boy as the main charcter. With the young boy as the main charcter you can relate better being in your teen years knowing how much knowledge means to you and how much you want it, so I could see the book from a first-person perspective almost. This is a great book for anyone who enjoys people digging up someone's ghostly past and revealing the whole truth! The author wrote an amazing book in the post Nuclear bomb testing era in the New Mexico area and has a young boy take an amazing adventure to dig up the truth to the ghostly files of Los Alamos and bring out the truth that every reader was so desperate to know about!In my opinion, I give this book a 7/10 !"}, {"userName": "Molly Jo", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1664364-molly-jo", "userReview": "This book totally took me back to when I was 12 and reading my first mystery novel! Actually, I may have been younger. It was Megan's Island by Willo David Roberts. Ah, the memories. Moving on.Poor Oz! He goes into the family restaurant to get things ready for the night and finds a dead body and a LOT of blood in the freezer. Not exactly conducive to a nice evening. Things rapidly spiral out of control when it looks like Oz's brother had the perfect motive and opportunity. The police also enlighten Oz to the fact that his father was accused of stealing government secrets from the lab he worked at. The rest of his family tried to keep from Oz. When Oz's brother is arrested, it's up to Oz to figure out exactly what's going on and how it's connected to his father's past. He looks up former co-workers and their families to try and pry out more information, hoping to clear his brother's name.Your heart has to go out to Oz. He has more information about the murder than he should, but is scared to death to go to the police. To Oz, the police look like the bad guys and he has no idea who to trust. He does have his best friend, Rusty, though, who I absolutely adore. She's a budding CSI who carries around a crime scene kit at all times. She's a smart little thing. Smart ass, too. It's up to Rusty to help Oz keep things in perspective at times, even though he's not completely inclined to listen to her advice. Typical boy.There wasn't anything that seemed grossly far-fetched in the book. Any investigation the kids did was within their abilities, and the consequences were realistic. Julia Platt Leonard did a wonderful job expressing Oz's fear about what was going to happen to his family and the business.The emotions are true and raw. I even got pretty caught up in the tension of the conclusion. I would definitely recommend this one to any young teens or pre-teens.

Oz who is the boy gets his brother taken away by the police because they think that he committed the crime. Oz goes to his mom's lawyer to find out what is going on. Oz does the investigation by himself and finds out that someone who worked with his dad (the dad was pronounced a traitor after some files got out of the nuclear plant that he worked in, but it was a lie the man who did the murder leaked the files)and the prep cook at the restaurant killed the newspaper writer because the cook was tired of being lower than Oz's brother and the other guy was scared that the newspaper writer would find out too much so they killed the man and tried to frame Oz's brother. At the end they both go to jail and the restaurant opens again. One quote is \"He'd just told us he didn't have a phone, hadn't he\"? This shows that people will lie when they are stressful situations. This ties to the quote when people lie they get into more stressful situations than before because the man who said this quote dies at the end of the book. Another quote is \"And for the first time in my life, I was completely alone\". This shows that Oz was never alone in his life until this murder and it ties to the theme people can never be alone or they will not live life the way it is meant to be lived because if they don't have anyone to talk to then they will have no meaning in life just like Oz in this part of the book."}, {"userName": "Tammy Dahle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2612859-tammy-dahle", "userReview": "My thoughts: Finding a dead body in a walk in freezer is not a good way to start the day.

I like that Rusty is a female and that she is more of the CSI brains of the operation. I find it odd that the parents are always absent in these kinds of novels though...really? You are off in France and can't get back more quickly?"}, {"userName": "Riley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4601954-riley", "userReview": "This book is about a boy named Oz Keiller. One day he walks into his restaurant to find a dead body in the freezer. The police start looking into the murder, and find Oz's brother Dave, to be a prime suspect. Oz learns that the victim was a reporter who wrote an article accusing his dad stealing nuclear secrets.Oz then works with his friend Rusty to try to prove Dave innocent. In the process of doing this Oz almost gets killed, and learns a lot about his father. The ending is very surprising, because it ends up being one of Oz's coworkers and a politician. Both try to harm and kill Oz, but end up getting arrested."}, {"userName": "Brian M.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46537976-brian-m", "userReview": "In the novel, Cold Case by Julia Platt Leonard, a family who runs a local restaurant in Santa Fe called Chez Isabelle is in jeopardy of losing it all after 13 year old Oz Keiller finds a dead body in the back of the restaurant. The police arrive and Oz is stuck in a slippery situation. Dave, Oz\u2019s older brother is the prime suspect in the murder investigation. Then, Oz sets out on a quest to find the real murderer. This novel was a thrilling chase when in reality, the truth was right in front of their eyes. This book was a thrilling page turner.

It is about 13 year old Oz who needs to clear a case about his brother who is charged with murder. Oz also must find out more about his dads death also. The murderer will stop at nothing to make sure he is not suspected. Will Oz succeed? Read and find out. I rate this book a 4.5 out of 5 stars. It is a very descriptive book. It gets very good near the end and picks up the pace. It needs a little more action in the beginning but it is a great book. If you want to find out more open up Cold Case."}, {"userName": "Steven M", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46539914-steven-m", "userReview": "This is a great mystery book that I would recommend to anyone who love reading mysteries, suspense, or adventure books. This book is about a boy named Oz Keillor who finds a body in the walk-in freezer at his family\u2019s restaurant. What I liked about this book is that the murderer was someone unexpected. All the characters developed a lot as well. However, there are just too many suspects. Too many characters were made just to be a suspect. In addition, the character made to be a suspect don\u2019t make the story as interesting anymore.

Mysteries are pretty scare for young adults, and this is a pretty decent one. And a murder mystery, at that.
