Her stories are so heartwarming and this one was no different. There were some parts of the story that I did find odd like why Jo Marie was so intrigued by Mark with no real reason. It was also unrealistic the way Ellie and her husband quickly resolved their issues. However, overall I really enjoyed this story. I am just not sure all of this could happen In real life but that's why it's fiction right? :)"}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23016460-amber", "userReview": "Jo Marie and the rest of the Rose Harbor Inn gang are back in a new adventure.

As Jo Marie prepares Rose Harbor Inn for her weekend guests, she finds herself once again intrigued by her cranky handyman, Mark Taylor. A gifted carpenter, Mark is going to build Jo Marie a gazebo, but she doesn\u2019t know anything about his past and can\u2019t help wondering, can\u2019t help asking.Maggie and Roy Porter have been treated to a weekend getaway by his parents, but Jo Marie notices the tension between them immediately. She hopes the Inn will work its healing magic on them, but she has no idea of the magnitude of what has passed between them. Perhaps Roy\u2019s old love letter can heal such deep wounds, but there is yet another shock in store for this couple.Ellie Reynolds has come to Cedar Cove, against her mother\u2019s wishes, to meet a man she knows only from online and telephone contact. She\u2019s half in love with Tom already, but her mother is mistrustful of any man after Ellie\u2019s father abandoned them. But Tom seems to be everything Ellie has ever wanted. They click from their first contact. But can the budding romance survive the surprise that Tom has in store for Ellie? Jo Marie is still negotiating her own grief for the loss of her husband, Paul, and when cleaning, tidying, prying into Mark\u2019s life and baking fails to provide sufficient distraction, Rover, her rescue dog, reminds her of Paul\u2019s last letter. Macomber\u2019s format for the full-length books of this series seems to be the stories of two sets of guests at Rose Harbor Inn with snippets of Joe Marie\u2019s life interspersed, and the mention of the next book\u2019s guests in the final chapter. She gives the reader believable characters with realistic and often topical dilemmas, and while the queen of feelgood specialises in happy endings, the road is not always a smooth one.

The characters in this story almost became unlikeable and I typically am more tolerant about characters in Debbie Macomber's books. I gave it an additional star because she didn't spend a lot of time retelling the story in a story which pleased me, I just wish the plot lines were more resolved and that there weren't so many secrets and childish arguing and must every person in love be so completely unsure of themselves? The immaturity of these characters kind of gave me a headache. I'm typically a BIG fan but I should have waited to read this book until next year -- closer to the time the next book comes out.

All the letters have a profound effect--through what was said, and what was never read. Innkeeper Jo Marie Rose has had a year to settle into proprietorship of the Rose Harbor Inn. The little town of Cedar Cove, Washington has proved to be a welcoming source of renewal, giving her a new purpose in life after the death of her husband, Paul. Letting go of the dreams of her married life and future with Paul is very difficult, and at times, it seems as if old memories are reluctant to move aside for hopes for the future. One constant throughout the last year, besides the devotion of her dog, Rover, has been the tumultuous friendship she has shared with carpenter and handyman, Mark Taylor. Mysterious, moody, and maddening, Mark nonetheless has connected to Jo Marie and offered her his own version of support. Dealing with her guests, seeing to their needs, and quietly building her business is helping Jo Marie to heal, just as she hopes visitors will find their own healing during their stay at the inn. Young Ellie Reynolds has come to Cedar Cove to meet a man she has become acquainted with online. At first, he seems all that she imagined and more, but he has a surprising personal agenda that will change Ellie's life in ways she never expected. A married couple, the Porters, are on a second-chance second honeymoon of sorts, but mistakes made by both husband and wife may be more than they can overcome. Love letters, as well as hopes and dreams, will be lost and found. Hearts will be broken, and then mended. What will the future hold for all? Come to Cedar Cove and enjoy a pleasant stay at the Rose Harbor Inn. Jo Marie and Rover are waiting to greet you.Review Copy Gratis Amazon Vine"}, {"userName": "Vicky", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11335829-vicky", "userReview": "Debbie Macomber is usually my choice for a feel good sweet story. Love Letters, the third Rose Harbor Novel, just wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. The issues weren't as believable and the problems the characters had to overcome were difficult. Maggie and Roy Porter come to the inn, to rekindle their marriage. He has been having an online/work romance with an old girlfriend. Even though they haven't had sex, his threatened wife goes to a bar, gets drunk and has sex with a stranger, resulting in a pregnancy. Really? Ellie Reynolds meets a guy online and comes to Cedar Cove to meet him in person. It turns out that his stepfather is her long lost birth father. Really? I was a little disappointed with the story line focusing on Mark and Jo Marie. Why couldn't their relationship have remained friendly and evolved more slowly? Why is Jo Marie being so noisy all of a sudden? I won this novel in a Goodreads giveaway from Ballantine Books/Random House in exchange for an honest review.

Thank you!Love Letters is the third book in the Rose Harbor series. I did not read the two books before this one and was still able to easily follow along with the story. It centres around Jo Marie, the owner of the Inn, and the guests that stay there.There are basically three stories that unfold within the pages of this book...First there is Jo Marie who owns the Inn and is still coming to terms with the loss of her husband two years earlier. Along with taking care of her guests she has an overwhelming curiosity about Mark her neighbour, friend and handyman. She wants to know why he is so secretive and what he is hiding. Their friendship is somewhat strained and often difficult. Although she finds him quite infuriating at times she wants to know more about him and figure out why he is so mysterious.The first guest to arrive at Rose Harbor is Ellie who is taking a chance on love with meeting the man that she has been communicating with on line and by phone but with whom she has never met. She is dealing with an overprotective mother who disapproves of the meeting and going against her wishes for the first time in her life. What starts out as an initial meeting of two people who are attracted to each other turns into so much more when things become complicated and she has to deal with lies and deceit while listening to her heart, head and her mother's voice.The next couple to arrive are Maggie and Roy who are using the weekend getaway to try to rekindle their marriage after both of them made enormous mistakes. As they try to forgive the past and move on they discover something so big that it seems impossible for them ever to recover. I have to admit that this story was my least favourite of the three only because the issues were so big that I found it a little unrealistic that it could all be solved in one weekend.The story weaves between these three stories as each character struggles with the cards that have been dealt to them. I found myself equally invested in all of the stories and hoping for a good outcome for them all. There is a tremendous amount of hurt, anger and sadness but at the centre of it all it was filled with love and hope.This was a perfect summer read. I do have to warn you that one story is left unresolved and wide open for another addition to the series. When I finished the book I was wishing that I had the next instalment at hand so that I could know how it will play out. Although it left me extremely frustrated it also left me eagerly anticipating the next book. I am going to go back and read the first two books while I wait for the next one to come out. I really like the fact that the books are about the different guests that stay at the Inn. It keeps the stories fresh and unique and a pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27020862-jennifer-lynn", "userReview": "There are many books that have multiple stories going on within them that make up the complete book, but this one had three going on that were so disconnected with the only link being the innkeeper and them staying there, that I wish she had just separated this into different books. Also, since the stories were so separated it makes it hard to rate the book as a whole. The only couple I had interest in was the innkeeper and her handyman. That story was the only one where I felt connected to the characters and wanted to see where they ended up. The other story of Ellie meeting the man she met on Facebook for the first time was really interesting in the beginning, especially since we really got to know the character`s history of being raised by just her overprotective mom in a strict household. Unfortunately when the surprise twist occurs and we find out why things happened, I felt the author didn't explore the anger at the grandparents and just brushed over the injustice of everything. Then the final couple, a married one where the husband emotional cheated so the wife has a one night stand? That whole thing was a mess and had no reality checks at all. That one story is enough for me to dismiss the whole book. The author obviously is bias in the writing style as the wife is written as the wronged one the whole story and almost no blame is thrown her way except by the husband but the author tries to make the husband the ogre there also. I hate when books are written where the guy is always blamed"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21166955-andrea", "userReview": "2.5 starsI think one of the main reasons my rating is so low is because I listened to the audio CD and the reader's voice consistently fluctuated between monotone and Siri. She also tried to do voices, but the voices were awful. Half the time the same character had a \"different voice\" from chapter to chapter and the intonation, inflection, and emphasis on some characters were just unbearable. Elle for example sounded like a spoiled brat and half-wit. Instead of adding depth to the characters, it was just annoying and obnoxious. By the end I just wanted to slap half of the characters. Although the writing is not stellar and I'm not expecting Shakespeare, I really think the reader ruined this story.Concerning the plot line, it was mostly improbable and unrealistic. First the wife gets all bent out of shape that her husband had an emotional affair, but then does something way worse and it's like the author found the husband's dead worse than the wife's. I understand the seriousness and damage of an emotional affair, but it just seemed a little weak to be the reason for one of the main plot lines of the book. And Jo Marie, don't get me started.... again, the plot of her being bizarrely obsessed with finding out about Mark really wasn't as exciting as it was made out to be. It just became annoying after a while; and mainly unexplained for the most part.

These novels capture the essence of small town Pacific Northwest life perfectly and always introduce me to captivating characters. This installment is no different as Jo Marie is still navigating the troubled waters of widowhood and becoming increasingly closer to handyman, Mark Taylor. I loved getting to see more into Mark's life in this one, but I can't wait for the big reveal on his past.As with the previous novels, the plot lines also focus on Jo Marie's guests. This time we have Ellie Reynolds and Maggie and Roy Proctor. Ellie is a twenty three year old woman who is taking a chance on love while the Proctors are trying to save their marriage after dishonesty and affairs have threatened to rip them apart.Ellie's story was interesting as it had some unexpected twists and turns. I can't reveal those without providing spoilers, but I was more invested in her story than the Proctors'. I loved Ellie's gumption and courage. It is never easy to forge your own path - especially when a parent is trying to steer you in a different direction.The Proctors had glimmers of a strong and loving relationship, but as more and more deceit and hurt came to light, a wedge was driven between the couple. I found myself both frustrated with Maggie and saddened by her situation. I never liked Roy. He blamed his wife for a situation that he was a catalyst for and it took awhile before he finally owned up to his part in the whole ordeal. I think they both made so many mistakes, but stubbornness and pride wouldn't allow them to apologize and move forward. I was thankful that I couldn't truly understand their marriage and choices. Readers of the Cedar Cove series will also be pleased that old favorites make appearances from time to time in Jo Marie's life. I haven't read the original series, but hope to make time for it one day. I have several of the first books in the Cedar Cove series patiently waiting their turns on my Kindle.If you're a fan of a cleaner, mature sort of chicklit, you must give this series a try. The setting and characters always make reading a Rose Harbor Inn novel a treat.One Last Gripe: My biggest complaint was the storyline between Maggie and Roy.Favorite Thing About This Book: Spending time in my beloved Pacific NorthwestFirst Sentence: If someone had told me, as little as two years ago, that I'd own and operate a bed-and-breakfast in this tiny burg of a town called Cedar Cove, I would have laughed my head off.Favorite Character: Jo MarieLeast Favorite Character: Roy"}, {"userName": "Warren-Newport Public Library", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3657546-warren-newport-public-library", "userReview": "Looking for a sweet story?

Certes, sont histoire est attendrissante mais elle est insupportable \u00e0 toujours se m\u00ealer de la vie des autres et \u00e0 vouloir tout savoir, m\u00eame ce qui ne la regarde pas !Les personnages secondaires ne sont pas nombreux. L\u2019histoire se concentre vraiment sur Jo Marie, ses clients et son \u00ab homme \u00e0 tout faire \u00bb, Mark Taylor, qui est sans doute le personnage le plus myst\u00e9rieux et le plus intriguant du roman. En d\u00e9finitive, Une Lettre en \u00e9t\u00e9 est une lecture agr\u00e9able mais sans plus. Je ne regrette pas de l\u2019avoir lu, il remplit \u00e0 merveille sa fonction de lecture estivale mais ne me laissera pas un souvenir imp\u00e9rissable.

Needless to say, they both got more than they bargained for in this trip to Cedar Cove. Betrayal, abandonment and forgiveness are the main themes of the story. I really like how Debbie Macomber weaves these stories together without losing the thread. I liked Ellie\u2019s story better than Roy & Maggie\u2019s. Truth is they were both well developed and unexpected, but Ellie's was more complex. Just when I thought she's just this sweet girl looking for prince charming... Bam! Someone else enters the picture. And then there\u2019s a couple trying to work out their issues and when they finally kinda do... Bam! They\u2019re caught up completely by surprise by a new person in their lives. I do think that Roy & Maggie worked things out too quickly in that scene. These things always seem a bit forced. But hey, they did spend most of the book trying to save the marriage. And, of course, there\u2019s also a healthy dose of Mr. mystery in person. One of the things I really like about this series is Jo Marie\u2019s & Mark\u2019s friendly relationship slowly building up to so much more. Rover makes it a lovely triangle. That blew him a kiss scene was so cute I couldn\u2019t keep a smile off my face when he finally mentioned it in the end. I\u2019m all for the getting to know each other before making a significant move kind of romance, but I think it\u2019s time this moves forward, is it not? Cause that cliffhanger? No can do. Need next book! Also, how great are those introductory letters to us readers, right?"}], "description": "Summer is a busy season at the inn, so proprietor Jo Marie Rose and handyman Mark Taylor have spent a lot of time together keeping the property running. Despite some folks\u2019 good-natured claims to the contrary, Jo Marie insists that Mark is only a friend. However, she seems to be thinking about this particular friend a great deal lately. Jo Marie knows surprisingly little about Mark\u2019s life, due in no small part to his refusal to discuss it. She\u2019s determined to learn more about his past, but first she must face her own\u2014and welcome three visitors who, like her, are setting out on new paths. \u00a0 Twenty-three-year-old Ellie Reynolds is taking a leap of faith. She\u2019s come to Cedar Cove to meet Tom, a man she\u2019s been corresponding with for months, and with whom she might even be falling in love. Ellie\u2019s overprotective mother disapproves of her trip, but Ellie is determined to spread her wings. \u00a0 Maggie and Roy Porter are next to arrive at the inn. They are taking their first vacation alone since their children were born. In the wake of past mistakes, they hope to rekindle the spark in their marriage\u2014and to win back each other\u2019s trust. But Maggie must make one last confession that could forever tear them apart. \u00a0 For each of these characters, it will ultimately be a moment when someone wore their heart on their sleeve\u2014and took pen to paper\u2014that makes all the difference. Debbie Macomber\u2019s moving novel reveals the courage it takes to be vulnerable, accepting, and open to love.BONUS: This edition includes an excerpt from Debbie Macomber's Silver Linings.", "title": "Love Letters\n      \n          (Rose Harbor #3)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20262703.Love_Letters__Rose_Harbor___3_", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1396061708l/20262703.jpg", "reviews": 839, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11349.Debbie_Macomber", "name": "Debbie Macomber"}], "type": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20262703-love-letters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20812089-love-letters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19480612-love-letters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25430600-love-letters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19481078-love-letters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35213766-la-m-lodie-de-l-t", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25707545-une-lettre-en-t", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233044.The_Shop_on_Blossom_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/143761.A_Good_Yarn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/366346.204_Rosewood_Lane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13414594-the-inn-at-rose-harbor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2449962.Twenty_Wishes"]}
