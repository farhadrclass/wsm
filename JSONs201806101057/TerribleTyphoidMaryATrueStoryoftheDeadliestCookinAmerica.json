In 1906, several members of the Warren family, her latest employer, grew ill with what was later diagnosed as typhoid fever. Convinced that tainted drinking water was to blame, the family packed up and fled the rented seaside house for their city home. The owner of the Oyster Bay house, fearing that he would have trouble reletting the place with the stigma of typhoid fever hanging overhead, contacted the local health department. Enter George Soper, a sanitary engineer, who managed to trace the contamination back to some homemade peach ice cream which had been prepared by Mary Mallon.Though it took many months, Soper tracked Mary down after two women died of the fever in a Park Avenue townhouse. The confrontation did not go well. Mary, mistrustful of science, and fearful for her livelihood, was uncooperative when Soper demanded blood, urine, and stool samples. But eventually, the combative cook ended up being taken into custody. She spent decades hidden away on a small island in the East River, still unconvinced that she, a healthy person, had somehow made others ill.This is an interesting tale of medical detection which reads almost like a novel. The book is aimed at younger readers, which, to me anyway, means that the author cuts right to the heart of the matter, and there is less repetition than in adult history books. It would be a great read for a book club, opening all sorts of discussions about public safety versus one individual's civil rights."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7542614-jennifer", "userReview": "This is the best book about Typhoid Mary that I have read.

Soper] felt certain that he had gathered enough epidemiological evidence to prove that Mary was spreading the killer disease.At this point, however, the evidence that Mary Mallon caused typhoid wherever she worked was circumstantial. The fact that she happened to work at places where typhoid fever broke out did not prove that she caused the outbreaks. The outbreaks may have been a coincidence. The fact that Mary escaped the illness wasn\u2019t proof either. Nor was the fact that she left her employment soon after typhoid broke out.But these facts--and her behavior--convinced Soper that Mary Mallon was \u2018a menace to the public health.\u2019 The circumstantial nature of the evidence did not deter him.\u2018As a matter of fact, I did not need the specimens [of her urine, feces, and blood] in order to prove that Mary was a focus of typhoid germs,\u2019 he said. \u2018My epidemiological evidence had proved that\u2019Soper was wrong. He did need the specimens. As scientists and statisticians know, correlation does not imply causation. So far, he had only established a pattern that put Mary at the scene of the outbreaks. He needed the specimens to prove that Mary had caused the outbreaks.\u201dImagine feeling perfectly healthy and having some stranger come up to you, tell you that you are a public health menace to society, and demand that you immediately provide him specimens of your urine, feces, and blood.Having been hired in 1906 by the owner of a seaside rental home to resolve the issue of a typhoid outbreak at the dwelling, sanitary engineer George Soper, who was neither medical doctor, health professional, nor scientist, tracked down, spied on, and confronted Mary Mallon, who had recently been a cook at that seaside rental property. Soper insisted that Mary provide him specimens. When he did not receive the response he desired, Soper persuaded the New York City Board of Health to arrest and forcibly obtain those specimens from Mary Mallon. In TERRIBLE TYPHOID MARY, author Susan Campbell Bartoletti takes readers on a roller coaster ride. We initially empathize as we read how \u201cTyphoid Mary\u201d was treated. Mary was a thirty-something Irish immigrant with no family or friends to come to her rescue. She\u2019d been working nonstop since arriving in America as a young teenager. After George Soper contacted them, the NYC Board of Health had a doctor and a bunch of policemen tackle Mary, shove her in a horse-drawn ambulance, and lock her up in a quarantine hospital. (The author shares a lively, detailed, first-hand account of the fight to take Mary into custody.) Since she was given no due process as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, it is easy to view Mary\u2019s treatment as a governmental kidnapping. The Board of Health had no idea what to do with her, so they just locked her up:\u201cMary had committed no crime, yet here she was, kidnapped, surrounded by sick people, cut off from the outside world, and forced to submit to medical tests. She had no idea how long the hospital intended to hold her.\u201dWe eventually have to reexamine our initial judgments when increasing evidence suggests that Mary Mallon was, in fact, responsible for infecting large numbers of people. The Board of Health determined through lab tests that Mary was a healthy carrier of typhoid. When, after several years, she finally obtained her freedom through a contractual agreement with the Department of Health, she seems to have subsequently infected a lot more people before she was once again locked away.Public health versus individual rights: That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been debating here in California as this new immunization law was working its way through the system. In telling the story of Susan Campbell Bartoletti has done a great job of framing TERRIBLE TYPHOID MARY within a similar public policy versus individual rights debate. It provides readers a great American history tale and leaves them with plenty to think about.Richie Partington, MLISRichie's Picks http://richiespicks.pbworks.comBudNotBuddy@aol.comhttps://www.facebook.com/richie.parti...Moderator http://groups.yahoo.com/group/middle_..."}, {"userName": "Abby Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson", "userReview": "Oh, man, what a great narrative nonfiction title! The book reads like fiction, presenting the true story of Mary Mallon (\"Typhoid Mary\") with finely crafted writing that kept me interested (even though I read another book about Mary Mallon earlier this year). I especially appreciated how Bartoletti includes stats and examples relevant to today's world to put Mary Mallon's story in perspective. Also, I think she presents a balanced view of both Mallon and the health workers who sought to keep her locked up for what they ostensibly thought was the greater good.

Typhoid is an infectious disease and more common today in developing countries. It is a type of bacteria that is transmitted through fecal matter and sometimes urine. If a person does not wash their hands with hot, soapy water it can be transmitted through food, as in the case of this cook. I learned that she was quarantined for many years of her life. She was not able to move about freely. She was sequestered on Northerly Island in New York. What struck me was the unfairness of her treatment as compared to the other carriers of this disease who were the majority men. They were able to live seemingly \"normal\" lives. With the invention of antibiotics in the 1940's typhoid is not a big issue today. I learned a lot about how this disease was the impetus for the building of sanitation sewers and a system for safe removal of garbage. You can learn a lot about the time period from this book.

Some things I learned:1. Mary Mallon (\"Typhoid Mary\") was not some sloppy cook who didn't wash her hands. She was actually very clean and well-kept. It's just that at the time, without antibacterial soap or anything, it would be virtually impossible for her to wash her hands well enough to kill all the typhoid germs that got on them. She would have had to not only be very thorough, but use water that was hot enough to give her actual burns.2. Mary was not the only known \"healthy carrier\" of typhoid at the time. In fact, many other carriers - including a confectioner - infected more people than she did. Virtually none of these were locked up like she was, and not one was so sensationalized.3. A total of three people are known to have died from typhoid probably given to them by Mary. I'd imagined it to be more.Also, I think that when I learned about her in history class as a kid, I assumed that a cook who made food for, and infected, many people must work in a restaurant. Actually, Mary was a cook hired in various households and, at one point, a maternity hospital *wince*. Never a restaurant.Another fascinating character who emerges here: Dr. S. Josephine Baker. Unlike George Soper, the epidemiologist who first discovered Mary, Baker does not seem to have been hungry for fame and recognition. She does, however, seem to have been awesome. A female doctor at a time when that was unusual, she was well-respected and did great work toward helping the poor of New York with hygiene, especially as regarded their children. She reduced infant mortality as the first director of New York's Bureau of Child Hygiene. Before that, she personally went into the homes of the poor, delivered babies, and taught their parents safe and healthful ways to care for them.Also, one time, after a drunken man threw scalding water on his pregnant wife, Dr. Baker punched him in the face so hard she knocked him down a flight of stairs. She then stepped over him on her way out.(Not maybe the BEST way to solve a problem, but, you know, isn't that what we'd all WANT to do?)"}, {"userName": "Ariel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22465719-ariel", "userReview": "Holy cow was this book easy to read and follow along. Even though I've listened to at least two different podcasts on the topic of Typhoid Mary (shout out to Stuff You Should Know and Stuff you missed in History Class), this book was incredibly knowledgable on the topic as well as a great start and insight to the ethics of holding a patient prisoner as well as the start of declassifying medical information before HIPAA became the norm and the law. This is a great, easy read but man, does it leave you freaked out. How does one know if they're a carrier?! I suddenly became paranoid at my past medical history and that maybe I was a secretly carrier. But thank heavens that this is the 21st century and if I'm a carrier for anything, it's for the amount of cheese dust on my fingers from Cheetos. This did raise the interesting question to me if there still are carriers today. We do have the science of modern medicine to be thanked for quite a few horrific diseases no longer being as common or outright extinct (but thanks to the damn anti-vaxxers, maybe not anymore), are there still carriers among us? And if so, what are they carrying?

When Ms. Bartoletti writes on issues of historical or cultural significance, teachers want their kids to read it, for few are more precise with facts and can better turn a distant historical event into a relevant lesson for today, engendering emotional understanding for people who lived many years ago and the tragic mistakes they made. Such is the case with Mary Mallon in this book, victim of a perfect storm of cultural biases and mitigating factors that stole her liberty for no real fault of her own in an age when bureaucracy held ultimate power to wreck the lives of innocents if they considered it the right move to make. Was \"Typhoid Mary\" a pawn in a cruel game played by public health officials prejudiced against her divergences from the cultural norm for women, or were their concerns legitimate that she was dangerous to society and must be contained? Buckle up for a tumultuous ride; Terrible Typhoid Mary: A True Story of the Deadliest Cook in America sorts through these issues and more to arrive at some surprising conclusions regarding the handling of the affair. You'll never view Mary's strange case\u2014or the everyday spread of germs around and on you\u2014the same way again.  The wealthy Warren family was pleased with the cook they hired to manage the kitchen of their Oyster Bay, Long Island mansion in 1906. Mary Mallon ran a tight ship, keeping her kitchen meticulously clean and crisply delegating responsibility to the domestic staff. Her job included preparing food for the family and all the servants, so she was rarely afforded time to sit and rest, but relaxing was foreign to her nature anyway. An unmarried Irish Catholic who immigrated from the Emerald Isle as a teen, Mary parlayed her culinary efficiency into gainful employment in America, earning a nice salary for a young woman on her own. The Warrens liked the dishes she whipped up, in particular her specialty: homemade ice cream with fresh peach slices stirred in, a mixture of sweet and tangy no one could create quite like Mary. Her arrangement with the Warrens appeared to be a promising career track.  But then nine-year-old Margaret Warren took sick, a slight fatigue and fever at first that degenerated into violent, life-threatening illness, and the girl was rushed to the hospital. The other Warrens and their servants began falling ill as well, though not Mary, who helped care for Margaret as her symptoms worsened. Doctors identified the contagious malady as typhoid fever, an infection that slew one out of five sufferers at the time, but they diagnosed it soon enough to spare the Warren family and their servants. Fearing contaminated water or typhoid germs in the house itself, the Warrens deserted Oyster Bay, and Mary was on her own to find new employment. Mrs. Thompson, whose husband owned the Oyster Bay manor and let it out to well-off families like the Warrens, was concerned about the incident. Investigators couldn't trace the typhoid outbreak to bad water, milk, or other perishable products, and close inspection of the house turned up nothing alarming. If the mini epidemic couldn't be dealt with to assure prospective tenants they weren't at risk of contracting typhoid, no one would rent the Thompsons' lovely shoreline property. Mrs. Thompson hired George Soper, sanitary engineer and private health detective of modest renown, to solve the mystery. With all the gusto and ambition that drove him when he eventually came face to face with Mary, Soper took up the trail and started asking questions.  George Soper was no doctor, but he knew his business, and began systematically ruling out causes of the typhoid outbreak just as public health officials had done. He, too, was headed for a dead end, until he found out there had recently been someone new in the Warren household at the time of the infections: the cook. Immediately Soper hypothesized that Mary, described as healthy and immaculately clean, might be a \"healthy carrier\" of typhoid bacteria, a former sufferer of the disease whose body hadn't fully eradicated its germs. If Mary were a healthy carrier, her gallbladder could still teem with bacteria that would get into the food she prepared and make anyone sick who consumed it. The discovery of a healthy carrier would be a godsend for Soper's career, vaulting him into the conversation with the great medical pioneers of his day and bringing him fortune. Piecing together Mary's employment history, he found a trend of typhoid outbreaks at most places she worked, reinforcing his theory. But the sanitary engineer had a major hurdle to clear: where was Mary now? Soper had no solid leads on where she'd gone after parting ways with the Warrens. He had to find her forthwith, however: if his idea was correct that Mary was a carrier, anyone she prepared food for would be in jeopardy. Life or death could depend on Soper's detective skills. By the time he located the cook, now working at a Park Avenue house, the family's twenty-five-year-old daughter was dying of typhoid. Soper confronted Mary in her kitchen with his theories regarding her unusual status as a healthy carrier, wondering how the spunky thirty-something immigrant would respond, and Mary showed she was more wild Irish rose than shrinking violet. Incensed that Soper would question her sanitary habits (he suggested she didn't wash her hands after using the bathroom) and her health (Mary didn't understand how a healthy person could spread deadly bacteria), Mary grabbed a sharp carving fork and attacked Soper, expelling him from her kitchen. The nerve of that man, demanding specimens of her blood and excretory waste for study! If Soper was to confirm Mary as the cause of the typhoid cases that seemed to surface wherever she worked, he'd have to come up with a Plan B.  George Soper later wrote that he only wished to help Mary devise a strategy for preventing the spread of her germs, and was disappointed that she showed no concern for the harm she inflicted on others. He followed Mary to the apartment of decommissioned police officer August Breihof, a close friend she regularly visited, and Soper became pals with him behind her back. But cornering her in the apartment yielded no better result than the kitchen confrontation, so Soper enlisted the help of Dr. Josephine Baker to reason with Ms. Mallon, again to no effect. When Soper, Baker, and three policemen showed up to force Mary to comply with their request for physical samples, she took off running and hid, but was discovered on the premises and taken into custody. The Irish spitfire who wouldn't demurely accept Soper's ridicule of her professionalism was out of options. Thorough analysis of Mary's specimens proved George Soper correct: she was a healthy carrier of typhoid, the reason for the Warren outbreak and every other occurrence of typhoid at the houses that employed her. A big question could no longer be delayed: what was the New York City Board of Health to do about this woman? Removing her gallbladder was one recourse, though surgery in the first decade of the 1900s was a dubious proposition, and would by no means guarantee the end of the threat posed by Mary. She could be released if they trained her in special cleansing measures and she promised never again to take a job as cook, but what would she do for a living? Mary didn't trust the health board or their scientists, fearing they were railroading her not because she presented any actual peril to people she came in contact with, but because they wanted a patient to experiment on. She wasn't about to consent to that. Refusing to cooperate with Soper and his colleagues in every way she could, Mary gave the Board of Health no other option: she would be remanded into custody at Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island, where she would be free to walk the grounds and live in a small shack by herself where she couldn't infect the population of New York. Besides a fox terrier that lived with her, she would be utterly alone.  Important as decisions pertaining to Mary's freedom were, the average American knew only limited specifics of her case until June 1909, when William Randolph Hearst's New York American newspaper blew her anonymity to bits by publishing every detail of the case on its front pages. Paranoid and fearful before, Mary's anxiety was at an all-time high as the last vestiges of her privacy were snatched away. For a woman forced to live in exile and dependence on others for her every need after a life of diligent work and proud independence, this was as low as it could get. Yet it was the New York American headlines that began turning the tide of public opinion in Mary's favor. Attorney George O'Neill followed up on her personal information and offered the quarantined woman representation in court, a basic right she had been denied by the unilateral authority of the New York Board of Health. Dressed to the nines and exuding quiet dignity, Mary showed up in court to hear O'Neill deliver an impassioned defense of her civil rights to the judge. Mary was a healthy woman, yet the government had ignored her rights and subjected her to indefinite incarceration without due process. If this were permitted to continue, the precedent set would imperil the American justice system. Were civil rights mere suggestions the courts could waive if they wanted to, or an ironclad contract they were obligated to honor? Not only that, but other healthy carriers identified in New York and elsewhere had been allowed to resume normal lives without government inhibition. Why was Mary any different? A double standard was being employed, and it had to stop. Many Americans agreed with George O'Neill's eloquent arguments, raising the hue and cry for Mary's liberation, but the judge saw it differently. The New York City Board of Health had the right to protect its citizens from a typhoid pandemic, he decreed, and Mary was to remain on North Brother Island. After all the positive press and hype for Mary's day in court, O'Neill's representation amounted to little.  It did not, however, amount to nothing. Under increasing public pressure to do right by the nation's most famed typhoid carrier, new health commissioner Ernest J. Lederle offered Mary a deal: if she promised not to cook, and to abide by precautions taught her by the health department to prevent disseminating germs, she would be released. She also had to check in with the health department on a monthly basis to be reevaluated. Mary sullenly agreed to the conditional release, for she had been detained on the island three years, and freedom was immeasurably preferable to incarceration. Without an occupation and no training in another field of employment, though, Mary's prospects were bleak, and there wasn't much improvement over the next several years. The public forgot about her; George Soper and the New York Board of Health eventually did, too, and when she stopped reporting for her monthly reevaluations in 1914, few took notice. This would mark the start of her second wave of typhoid epidemics. In early 1915, typhoid engulfed Manhattan's Sloane Hospital for Women, infecting twenty-five people. The hospital kept strictly sanitary conditions that should have limited a typhoid outbreak; it was a mystery, and for health mysteries in New York City, George Soper was now more than ever the man to call. It didn't take long to trace the rash of typhoid occurrences to the arrival of the new cook, who vanished before authorities could apprehend her. But police caught up with her in less than a month, and Mary Mallon was remanded for a lifetime stay on North Brother Island. What else could be done if she couldn't be trusted not to prepare food for unsuspecting victims? Mary's youthful feistiness had dimmed, but her spirit wasn't broken by being sentenced to lifelong isolation. She made friends at Riverside Hospital, including Dr. Alexandra Plavska, who trained Mary in laboratory work and hired her as an assistant. Mary approached her new field of employment with the same enthusiasm she brought to the kitchen, earning her decent salary and providing outlet for her self-discipline and desire to contribute to society. In a day and age when the average American woman's life expectancy was fifty years, Mary lived a healthy life into her sixties, before suffering a stroke and becoming bedridden in her twilight years. She died at sixty-nine in 1938, having led something of a full life despite her permanent quarantine, holding on to as much privacy as possible by revealing little about herself publicly, speaking only with trusted friends who never broke confidence. Thus ended the life of a person the public couldn't decide between labeling as a hero or villain, an innocent martyr or loathsome scourge to society. How you think of Mary Mallon is up to you. Terrible Typhoid Mary encourages hot debate not just about civil liberties, but fundamentals of right and wrong. What is the proper course of action if a majority of society agrees someone is a public menace, for whatever reason? Is it okay to lock them up even if they appear to present no danger, and insist they wouldn't hurt a soul? Does might make right, majority consensus overruling all else? What happens, then, when government starts arresting people for having opinions contrary to those of the bureaucracy, declaring them \"dangerous\" individuals? Is the passage of laws an absolute that suddenly makes a behavior morally wrong even if it was considered not objectionable\u2014or at least not worthy of legal repercussions\u2014a short time ago? What about the people affected by these changes to the moral code, people whose lifestyle may be infringed upon as Mary Mallon's lifestyle as a professional cook was by accusations that her food preparation harmed others? What standard should be employed in order for someone to be declared objectively dangerous to innocent citizens so the government has a responsibility to stop them? It's a massive quagmire, brimming with implications for any organized society. Mary Mallon couldn't be blamed for the fact that her body harbored typhoid bacteria; it wasn't her choice, yet the Board of Health and the judge who upheld their decision kept her marooned on an island for decades. What would you do if authorities decided something about you that you can't change is reprehensible, and you must be punished for it? Would you have turned into a despicable person overnight? Of course not, but you'd be treated as though you had. The personal nature of the accusations is what goaded Mary, as we read from her initial encounter with George Soper. \"Soper's words may have sounded preposterous to her. How could a healthy person make someone sick? Soper's accusation must have struck at the very core of her self-worth. Mary took great pride in her work. She kept a clean kitchen. She herself was clean. Mary's reaction surprised Soper. Instead of sharing his concern, she grew angry. She told him that she had never had typhoid. She had never been sick, but had nursed those around her who were sick, helping them through the terrible disease.\" If one takes pride in being a nurturer, cooling the brow of feverish sufferers and talking them gently through their travails, no accusation could hurt more than that you're the cause of the trouble, that you are harmful to the people you care for. This must have contributed heavily to Mary's refusal to believe the typhoid outbreaks that followed her were her fault. Who wants to believe their life's work is, at best, undoing damage they created themselves?  But the persecution of Mary can also undoubtedly be attributed in part to her nonconformity to contemporary standards of how women should act, Terrible Typhoid Mary notes. \"In 1907 society had strict ideas about womanhood and marriage, too, based on something called 'the middle-class ideal.' This ideal said that a proper woman should be married and have children. That she should be a good mother and the foundation of the home. That she should not work outside the home. That she should attend to the needs of her husband and children. That the welfare of society\u2014and even the fate of a nation\u2014depended on her.\" Mary's brash demeanor and unapologetic independence caused Soper to suspicion her immediately, as in any era the quirks of those who don't behave like everyone else often bring retribution down on their heads. Disturbing the universe is risky business, and refusing to conform to mainstream standards is the surest way to cause noticeable disturbance. Soper assumed Mary would be grateful for his intervention, that she'd want to work with him to defuse the bacterial time bomb in her gallbladder, but the cook wasn't interested. This, too, raises a question: when society says something's wrong with us and they can fix it, how are we to respond if we don't believe we have a problem? Others may see us as in need of alteration, but what if we're happy with ourselves the way we are? What if society joins forces to make us undergo the change, or be branded for life as a pariah? These considerations are part of Mary Mallon's story, and are given thoughtful treatment in this book. As Susan Campbell Bartoletti concludes, \"This I know for sure: Life is, as Mary says, uncertain. As a society and as individuals, we must protect healthy people from disease. We must also treat those suffering from disease in an intelligent, humane, and compassionate way. We need to be rational and keep our fears in check.\" Only if we make that our priority can we end the cycle of Typhoid Marys chewed up and spit out by societies that fear and hate them for reasons beyond their control, for aspects of themselves they have limited power over. After we've tamed our impulse to punish those different from us, we can approach our issues in mutual understanding, and that is where the battle is won.  \"There's a danger in writing a person's life from a historical vantage point, for hindsight can be smug.\" Susan Campbell Bartoletti leaves us this warning about judging people of the past, a vital reminder for those who pay attention to history. Too often we live as prisoners of today, seeing modern society as superior to everything that came before, regarding ourselves as better and more open-minded than our predecessors. That isn't true, of course; we're no better or worse than people of another era. We're just as given to shortsightedness, prejudice, and not living up to our potential as individuals and a society, and it's counterproductive to pretend otherwise. We can, however, humbly learn lessons from the past and apply them to our lives, and there's virtually no limit to what we can learn from Mary Mallon. Empathize with others, and don't casually throw away human life. Be tolerant, merciful, and guard the rights of those bullied by society.

In telling the story of Mary Mallong, Bartoletti examines cultural attitudes of the era, medical knowledge and attitudes, journalism practices, and human and civil rights violations. Bartoletti also manages to stay quite balanced in telling both story of Mallon and the stories of the physicians and others in the medical community. The vocabulary and language seem to be written at a lower level than some of Bartoletti's previous books, making this a good selection for middle school readers. Excellent end notes, a bibliography, and a timeline are great additions. Bartoletti's afterward, in which she explains some of her hypotheses, is also a strong component."}, {"userName": "Senator", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4019544-senator", "userReview": "A great resource on the dynamic life of Mary Mallon -- known more wildly as Typhoid Mary.

It takes a very fair view of all parties involved, neither demonizing Mary nor those health professionals who forcefully detained her. Much of this book does focus on Mary's unwilling detainment - something most people aren't aware of at all.

It also gives some background on the people who cause Mary to be incarcerated for most of her life.

This well-researched narrative provides an objective yet sympathetic portrayal of not only Mary but also of the other main players in the drama that become Mary\u2019s life. Scientific beliefs of the time about germs are explored, as well as the issue of human and civil rights. An absorbing read, this text of less than 200 words both informed and intrigued me.One admirable aspect of Terrible Typhoid Mary is the balance that Bartolli achieves in her depiction of Mary. On one hand, here is a cook who prides herself on the quality of her food along with the cleanliness of both the preparation and clean-up of meals. On the other hand, here is a carrier of typhoid who refuses to allow doctors to take samples of her urine, feces, and blood. Not only that, but Mary becomes brutish and violent when anyone tries to approach her with suggestions about how she might take proper precautions to avoid being a carrier. How does one reconcile these two sides of Mary? Bartolli shares how Mary\u2019s past might have led her to show extreme caution, as well notes that many people (even today) remain skeptical of the medical and scientific community.Besides Mary, another significant character is George Soper. A sanitary engineer at the time, he was often hired to improve living conditions and public health and to try to prevent the outbreak of epidemics. On the one hand, here is a conscientious man dedicated to finding the truth. Just as important, he is also passionate about protecting society. On the other hand, here is a man who believes that in find a healthy carrier of typhoid, he just might be on the verge of a medical breakthrough that could make him famous. How does on reconcile those two sides of Soper? Bartolli shares letters from the sanitary engineer that show him as originally sympathetic of Mary as well as that over time reveal his growing confusion over how anyone presented with facts could choose to ignore them.Another admirable aspect of Terrible Typhoid Mary is how well-grounded it is in an accurate setting. A complaint that I sometimes have about historical accounts, especially those which are portrayed on the screen, is how they ignore beliefs of the time to make a point. In contrast, Bartolli takes time to explain the varying viewpoints about the germ theory that had existed before the 1900\u2019s, some of which may have influenced how ones reacted to Mary. She also makes clear how risky and uncertain treatments for typhoid were back in Mary\u2019s day, and so why Mary may have been reluctant to listen to doctors. In addition, Bartolli takes time to explain the legal powers in place in the early 1900\u2019s, ones which allowed the medical community to imprison Mary on a secluded island, but which would not have allowed such a practice today. While Bartolli does point the questions which arose about the ethical treatment of Mary, she never imposes our modern-day values on any of the characters.That Terrible Typhoid Mary is accurate in setting will come as no surprise to anyone who looks at the book\u2019s back page. Over twenty-five pages are dedicated to crediting sources and providing additional reading lists. Moreover, not only is a source provided for pretty much every page and every chapter but Bartolli also elaborates on the text. As for the additional reading lists, there are ones about Mary, George Soper, typhoid and other diseases, public health law, and even about tabloid journalism. Wow!Bartolli has won honors and awards for her various nonfiction books. If Terrible Typhoid Mary is an example of the quality of her work, I can understand the accolades. For anyone interested in reading the story behind the tabloid scandal of Mary\u2019s life, Bartolli has offered an excellent option."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55783-christina", "userReview": "I was really fascinated by this book, although I almost didn't want to read it after I read the author's note at the beginning: \"Dear Reader, if you are squeamish\" and don't like to read about germs, or you're the type of person who uses antibacterial spray every five minutes, or doesn't touch doorknobs, etc, then \"you should stop now and find some other book to read.\" !! I loved that, because it's a fair warning, and because I'm sure it will serve to draw in some reluctant kid readers who might not have otherwise thought this looked like a good book. But a gross book about germs? They'll love it! Haha! Previously I knew a little bit about Mary Mallon, but mostly just the legends that have sprung up about her. So this was a fascinating book to read, meticulously researched, that gives the truth about her, or as much as can be known. The author freely states \"we don't know\" or \"it is thought that\" whenever she comes to a gap in the historical record, which is good, so that readers know as much as she knows and what there still is unknown about this historical figure. I probably don't need to explain that she was the early twentieth century Irish cook who unwittingly was a \"healthy carrier\" of typhoid and most likely passed on the disease to many of her employers and their families and servants. I loved how this book reads, just like a novel, with a conversational style and melodramatic descriptive chapter titles such as \"In Which There's Some Name-Calling,\" or, \"In Which It Takes a Squad of Sanitary Police,\" etc, just like a 19th century dime novel. Poor Mary really was given the bad end of the deal once the NY Board of Health found out about her; the author does a good job of explaining why they did what they did (dragging her off the street, keeping her locked up in solitary, etc) in light of the cultural practices of the time, and how the civil rights we enjoy today were not always respected, and so forth. You also do get some details about germs and how to study them, the history of early epidemiology and entymology and sanitation, and so on. A major character is the sanitation engineer who was the \"germ detective\" trying to figure out where all of these typhoid cases originated. There is a great list of sources, citations for all of the quotations, a bibliography and notes from the author. The one thing I wish had been done differently is having all of the photographs in a \"album\" at the back of the book. I'd rather be able to see a photograph of a person as I'm reading about them in a chapter, rather than flipping to the back to hunt for them, and I think modern nonfiction for kids tends to be more appealing if done that way. But perhaps this was a decision made to keep the book looking more like a novel, with uninterrupted text. I don't know. In any case, it's still a darn good read and well worth picking up. Just make sure you aren't eating lunch while you read it..."}, {"userName": "Bruce Gargoyle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22648121-bruce-gargoyle", "userReview": "I received a digital copy of this title from the publisher via Netgalley.Ten Second Synopsis:An in-depth look at the event leading up to the arrest and imprisonment of Mary Mallon, a healthy carrier of typhoid responsible for unwittingly infecting people at the houses she worked for as a cook.As narrative nonfiction books for youngsters go, this is a surprisingly engaging tale that attempts to look behind the scandalous headlines and get to the crux of Mary Mallon and her role in inadvertently spreading disease through her role as a cook for well-off households. The early chapters read a bit like a detective story as health officials attempt to find the cause of an outbreak of typhoid within a prominent family. I was drawn in from the start and the first half of the book had me guessing and deducing along with George Soper, a sanitation engineer with big dreams of unmasking the first \u201chealthy carrier\u2019 of typhoid in America.I appreciated the way in which the author looked at the \u201cchase\u201d from Mary\u2019s point of view. It was very easy to sympathise with her when, out of the blue from her perspective, a strange man turns up at her door telling her she is spreading a deadly disease and demanding she provide samples of bodily fluids. It was not hard to picture Mary\u2019s aggressive response to such an approach.The second half of the book, which concentrates on Mary\u2019s imprisonment on a hospital island for years at a time, moves at a much slower pace than the first half and takes a more in-depth look at the legal rights of Mary and the government orders that kept her from release. The competing forces of individual rights and protection of the public are discussed at length as the author points out other cases (the \u201cTyphoid Tom, Dick and Harries\u201d as I thought of them) of people who were known to be healthy carriers responsible for infecting others, but who weren\u2019t imprisoned.The author has created a very readable biography in which the characters spring off the page and the inconsistencies in the treatment of Mary in comparison to others in her situation allow the reader to get an insight into why Mary might have behaved in the way she did. Based on this experience, I would be very interested in reading more nonfiction by Bartoletti in the future, and I would recommend this to scientifically-minded youngsters and as a great conversation starter for classes learning about public health or individual rights."}], "description": "What happens when a person's reputation has been forever damaged?
