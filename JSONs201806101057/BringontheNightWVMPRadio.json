But what to do when a book is almost one giant spoiler? This was one of hardest reviews I\u2019ve written. I loved the book and want to tell you why\u2026but how to tell you that without ruining anything. Hmmmm......So here\u2019s my attempt at a non spoilery \u2013 yet interesting book review. Bring on the Night is about Faith.Ciara\u2019s lack of it.Shane\u2019s complete, blind belief in it.How many pieces of your soul will you sell to protect those you love?And oh yeah \u2013 there are zombies!Bring on the Night reminded me of a three act play. Act 1: The set up to the story. Things are better than they have ever been.Act 2: Then they are not.Act 3: The aftermath.Ciara\u2019s finally finishing up her college degree and has just completed her training with \u201cThe Control\u201d \u2013 a secret government agency whose mission is \u201cto balance the safety and well-being of humans AND vampires.\u201d Yeah right. They aren\u2019t named The Control for nothing\u2026.they blackmailed her into service and they are exerting an ever increasing amount of control over Ciara & Shane\u2019s lives.Despite the Control looming over them, Ciara and Shane have never been happier \u2013 they\u2019re living together, she\u2019s helping to plan best friend Lori and David\u2019s wedding. That is until dead bodies start popping up. They have reason to suspect it may be one their own. Jim, one of the vampires that works as a DJ at the WVMP radio station has been acting more and more reckless.But what they uncover is something much more sinister. A plague is spreading, the dead are rising and the events that unfold change their lives forever. The tone is very different for Bring on the Night than in the previous two books in the series. It\u2019s more introspective. I loved it. I really like when people get pushed to their breaking points and see how they handle it. Everything changes and no one will be the same. Relationships are different, the dynamics have shifted.That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t plenty of Jeri\u2019s trademark witty dialogue, musical influences and vampy goodness at every turn. While it is a darker book it\u2019s still action packed!OK - that\u2019s it for non-spoiler intel! So instead, I\u2019m going to wrap up my review by giving you my top 5 reasons that you should go buy this book (and the first two \u2013 Wicked Game & Bad to the Bone if you haven\u2019t read those yet).Number 5 \u2013 The Control. Government secrecy, manipulation and intrigue at its finest. I love me some secret government conspiracies!Number 4 \u2013 Zombies! Seriously\u2026.who doesn\u2019t love zombies??Number 3 \u2013 More vampires! The other vampire DJ\u2019s are starting to play a much larger role in the series, which I think is a good thing. Lots more Regina \u2013 there can never be enough Regina in my opinion!! And even more of elusive vampire Monroe.Number 2 \u2013 Sexy, sexy Shane. I have a somewhat unhealthy (or so my husband tells me) obsession with this particular vampire. And oh \u2013yea ..that David guy is still there for those of you who are David fans\u2026\u2026lol.The Number 1 reason you should go buy this book??\u2013 Here\u2019s the deal. Jeri has this planned as a five book series. She is signed through book 4 (which is tentatively titled \"Let it Bleed\" \u2013 due out 7/2011 \u2013 AWESOME title!). I NEED book 5 (tentatively titled \"Lust for Life\")! So we need lots of people to buy Bring on the Night and show their love. Consider it a personal favor. You\u2019ll have my undying gratitude \u2013 my undying devotion and \u2026.ok sorry that\u2019s all I got but it would make me very very happy!Loved: I love these characters so much and I was thrilled to see them all back. The series is really taking a big leap forward with this book and I like it.Nitpick: The solution to the plague storyline felt overly complicated to me. There were a lot of loose ends to wrap up (which she did) but there were several explanations when one would have been fine. I wasn\u2019t feeling the David & Lori relationship. David didn\u2019t seem to show much feeling towards Lori and she was off making wedding plans most of the time.****If you have read the book and would like to discuss the \"big events\" that occur I have set up a special spoiler section on my blog to discuss everything that happened - http://www.fwiwreviews.net/2010/08/en... ****"}, {"userName": "Eperdu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7673170-eperdu", "userReview": "The first thing that put me off the series was the passing of time between book 2 and 3. As another reader said, they thought they'd missed a book since so much time had passed. I quite agree.The continued unresolved sexual tension between David and Ciara is tiresome. I think it's been drawn out too long. I felt that Ciara's time at Control was too short and I would have liked to have seen more of her training. To jump into the world 2.5 years after book 2 and right into her training and then right back out of training within a chapter is disorienting.Again, with the passing of time it was a way for the author to write what she thought should happen with the characters and make it seem realistic/plausible. It seems that it was expected that weddings, school, training, etc should happen and they really didn't add anything to the story at all. It was all this hype to push the story forward in time and it was a waste.I believe this book was longer than the first two in words but it had no more actual content.That said, the mysterious and fatal virus was an interesting take. It worked in the story but it was a stretch at times. The new characters we met were stereotypical and too obvious for my tastes.This book was my least favorite of the series (so far). I still like the author and hope that future books have the kinks worked out. I just felt this book was a bit of a flop."}, {"userName": "Krys", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2798856-krys", "userReview": "I love the WVMP books by Jeri Smith-Ready. They make me happy. Last night I picked up Bring on the Night... and I just finished it. They're fun, they're quick. They are a hell of a read.I think I liked this one the best so far. Smith-Ready always manages to tell very inventive stories, but in this one she has surpassed herself. In the town of Sherwood, Ohio there is a fatal outbreak of a very extreme bout of chicken pox. At the same time Ciara and company encounter the walking dead, zombies!....zommmmmm.....biessssssss....!!!The story gets really tasty from there. Lots of character developments that made me squeal aloud, lots of surprises. It won't mean much if you haven't read Wicked Game or Bad to the Bone but it made me very happy....and playlists!! I love it when authors include playlists to their books. Jeri Smith-Ready and Rachel Caine do this with their books. Music nerd that I am, I always compile them from what I have in my I-tunes. Interesting to note, I was reading a very good sex scene in this book when Marilyn Manson's cover of Sweet Dreams came on in the playlist.Kinda Hot. Not gonna lie. I was into it.(Why yes, I do blog with this mouth. Frequently.)Suffice it to say I liked this book. A lot. I want the next one. Badly. A year off? Bugger. A whole year will reduce me to a shuddering pile of want. It's a pity really.5 of 5 stars.

Hands-down. In this world American vampires are under jurisdiction of the \u2018International Agency for the Control and Management of Undead Corporeal Entities\u2019, otherwise known as \u2018Control\u2019. Vampires need to be monitored by the Government because being undead has a few draw-backs. Mainly, vampires get mentally \u2018stuck\u2019 in the era in which they were turned, and they need the Control to help assimilate them into modern society and maintain a connection to this era. Another side-effect of vampirism is psychological ticks and oddities \u2013 most vamps develop OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) in various forms, partly because of the strain it takes them to live in current times and the mental/sensory overload of being a vamp.Ciara Griffin is the main protagonist of WVMP. She grew up as a con-artist and stumbled across the great vampire conspiracy when she applied for a job at vampire radio, WVMP. The radio station is a Control company designed to shelter vampire DJ\u2019s while also keeping them connected to the modern world \u2013 the DJ\u2019s are able to play music from their decade, but interact with modernity.Over two books Ciara has befriended these vampires, and fallen in love with 90\u2019s DJ vampire, Shane. Ciara has also gotten mixed up with Control and become an agent for them.This book follows on from the events of \u2018Bad to the Bone\u2019. In \u2018Bring on the Night\u2019 Ciara is finishing her Control training, completing her university degree and getting serious with Shane. Very early on in the novel Shane proposes to Ciara, and despite all human/vampire odds, Ciara agrees. Her fellow Control agents aren\u2019t all as thrilled with the engagement, however; \u201cCiara, listen.\u201d David\u2019s voice dipped. \u201cBe Shane\u2019s girlfriend, live with him as long as you can stand it, but don\u2019t take this step. If you could look ten or twenty years down the road, you\u2019d see all the things he can\u2019t give you.\u201dBut Ciara and Shane\u2019s happiness is put on hold in wake of a chicken pox pandemic spreading through Sherwood. Ciara never had chicken pox as a child, and she is exposed to at least 2 other diseased people. The chicken pox plague breaks out at the same time that cadavers (i.e.: Zombies!) are spotted around town. It all coalesces to be a big ol\u2019 bag of \u2018holy hell\u2019 for the WVMP crew and Control.You know those war movies where the troops proceed in orderly fashion, taking on the enemy as a single-minded unit? And then you know those other war movies where the battlefield is complete fucking chaos? This was the latter. This was the undead \u2018Braveheart.\u2019\u2018Bring on the Night\u2019 is perhaps the most important novel in the WVMP series thus far... because Ciara turns into a vampire. This is HUGE! With other Urban Fantasy series, readers have a fair idea of where vampire/non-vampire characters stand. Sookie Stackhouse fans know that Sookie isn\u2019t going to be bitten any time soon because Ms. Harris has said as much, and it goes against her beliefs. Likewise, nobody was particularly surprised when Cat was turned fully vamp in Jeaniene Frost\u2019s \u2018Night Huntress\u2019 series. But in WVMP Ciara being turned was totally up in the air. It could have gone either way, total 50/50. And I, for one, was shocked by Smith-Ready\u2019s choice to turn Ciara. I think Smith-Ready also set the first half of the book up as a red herring of sorts, because with Shane\u2019s proposal came Ciara\u2019s worries about their human/vampire differences. I thought that was a hint at the rest of the series... and then Smith-Ready goes and turns everything on its head by vamping Ciara.OH. MY. GOD.I loved Ciara\u2019s transition to vampire. It\u2019s quite realistically handled, even the mundane side of things (waiting for your fangs to pop, for example). But more than that, Ciara\u2019s turning is an emotional exploration. Smith-Ready really delves into Ciara\u2019s grieving. And Ciara doesn\u2019t just mourn the obvious things like sunshine \u2013 she laments losing her favourite foods, and her lost independence now that she is reliant on blood donors for her survival. Jeri Smith-Ready beautifully and sadly explores Ciara\u2019s loss of life, and she does so with a totally new perspective. Ciara sees her need of willing blood donors as a sign of dependency, and a loss of independency \u2013 she likens drinking from blood donors to begging for scraps of food. I never thought of it that way, but I could understand Ciara\u2019s sadness and fear completely.But for all the negatives, Ciara\u2019s vampirism allows her and Shane to have forever. This novel, more than the first two, delves into Shane and Ciara\u2019s relationship. There\u2019s a lot of delicious hot n\u2019 heavy between them in \u2018Bring on the Night\u2019, and it is wonderful! Shane has always been a very romantic, intense guy. But in this third book he exceeds his previous romantic endeavours and becomes a hot combination of Alpha/Beta hero gorgeousness; Shane raised his trembling hands like he wanted to seize me. But instead he rested them gently, one on each of my cheeks. \u201cCiara.\u201d He bent low and brushed my lips with nothing but his breath. \u201cI\u2019d have kicked God\u2019s own ass to get you back with me.\u201dShane and Ciara are one of my favourite UF pairings... and I love them even more after \u2018Bring on the Night\u2019. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but the ending will have you tearing up and going \u201cawwww!\u201d.This third book also has some kick-ass action and horror cool. One of my favourite scenes in the novel involved \u201cincompetent zombie cheerleaders\u201d. And that says it all, I think.\u2018Bring on the Night\u2019 is one of the best Urban Fantasy novels I have ever read, and it is a compliment to one of the most original UF series out there. Jeri Smith-Ready outdoes herself; she completely changes the trajectory of the series, overhauls her main protagonist and brings some seriously mushy romance to an otherwise zombie-butt-kicking novel. Amazing! I can\u2019t wait for fourth book \u2018Let it Bleed\u2019 coming August 2011."}, {"userName": "Larissa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2945573-larissa", "userReview": "Previously Published by me on The Book Lovers Inc blog: Book Lovers IncWarning: Contains spoilers if you haven\u2019t read the previous books in the series. OMG I so love this series and Jeri has done it again, in spades! Bring On the Night is the third installment is the fabulous WVMP Radio series and it is the best one yet. Bring On The Night starts about 2 years after the events in Bad To The Bone and things had never been better for our lovely Ciara Griffin and of course, that\u2019s when everything goes downhill. A plague is spreading and the body count just gets higher, Zombies are showing up and Ciara\u2019s life might end at any moment and there\u2019s really nothing she can do about it. I found myself gasping throughout this book, Jeri took Ciara\u2019s story to a new level and I was completely shocked by it. However she has told me herself that she had it all planned since the beginning, so i can just say WOW! I did NOT see that coming and I can\u2019t wait for more. I love this series and the uniqueness that the author has brought to the Vampire table. Jeri\u2019s vamps are so interesting because of their weakness. After being turned they tend to suffer from Temporal Adhesion, which is to say that psychologically they have trouble dealing with the changes the world has gone through and they tend to be stuck in the year/decade when they were turned. The WVMP Radio Vamps are lucky because they DJ in radio shows that feature the music from the period when they died, that way they can have that connection with their past and are able to deal with the present much better. How cool is that? I love it and the fact that music is such a great part of the series too. Ciara is not your garden variety heroine. She was raised by con artists and until the events in the first book of the series she lived on the road. She has grown and changed so much throughout these novels and in bring On The Night she is back better than ever. Let\u2019s not forget that our boy Shane is back, just as swoon worthy as usual. His and Ciara\u2019s relationship really suffer and evolves in this book and it made for an amazing read. Bring On The Night is an amazing addition to one of my favorite series ever and it definitely makes my Top Reads of 2010 list! If you haven\u2019t read this series you cannot seriously call yourself an Urban Fantasy fan! Go out and get this series right now! If you have read the series and haven't read this book yet, Oh My, get ready for a wild and wonderful ride!"}, {"userName": "Mello \u2763 Illium \u272eHarry\u272e \u2600Myrnin\u2600 Torin Ichimaru", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6981505-mello-illium-harry-myrnin-torin-ichimaru", "userReview": "[Ciara was going to change into a vampire (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Darcy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2225246-darcy", "userReview": "It seems like Ciara's life is never normal or boring, especially since she started working at the radio station. I mean come on how many people lived as grifter's when they were kids, have a vampire for a boyfriend, and even has a vampire dog. She also has to start working for an organization she really doesn't want to, to repay a debt for her boyfriend.With all of this craziness going on it is a wonder that she even has any normal aspects to her life at all. But she does somehow manage to do normal or as normal as she can quite well. So it is no surprise at all that all hell breaks loose and her normal flies right out the window. So much happens in this book it is sometimes hard to keep up. So without spoiling things here is what you have to look forward to in this book. More about the secret Control agency, zombies, weird diseases, Ciara and Shane having to face up to just what they mean to each other and just how far they are willing to go to be with each other, discord within the DJ ranks, and many, many people having to face and reevaluate their beliefs as they are shaken to the core.With all that has happened in this book it will be interesting to see where things go from here."}, {"userName": "Cathy ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526945-cathy", "userReview": "I'm a little too tired to grasp it all, but a summary would be that it's a very poignant and thoughtful kick-ass adventure. The Big Bad was a little lame because I didn't feel emotionally invested, but it totally wasn't the point. The book was about love and trust, faith and self-confidence, loss and love again. Many different kinds of love are portrayed. Faith is examined, reexamined, turned upside down and made to dance a little jig. The author took the story in directions I never expected, and I'm not surprised to that degree very often. Plus katanas, vampires, zombies, chicken pox, a lot of music, hot sex, and the bestest vamp dog ever. Like I said, a thoughtful, touching, violent, lovely, crazy, surprising WVMP adventure.

Braiiiiins..."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "Bring On the Night by Jeri Smith-Ready is the third installment in the WVMP series featuring Ciara Griffin, a former con artist, who works as a marketing director for WVMP, while at the same time, continuing to try to actually graduate from college after 9 years of going thru the motions. Now, Ciara only has to take one more class before she can actually graduate. If only things were that easy in this series.It has been nearly 3 years since the events of Bad to the Bone where Ciara agreed to become an agent with Control or the International Agency for Control and Management of Undead Corporeal Entities (UCE\u2019s) as a condition of allowing Shane McAllister to continue to see his family without being transferred to Alaska. She gets through her training class, and ends up graduating as an Agent. She, in turn, gets a very unusual assignment; working with a group of humans and vampires who have magic in them. Of course, with Ciara, it\u2019s all about her unholy blood due to her non faith.The main difference in this installment is the course of the story itself. Ms. Ready-Smith takes her story and character in the same direction of author Jeaniene Frost and her Night Huntress series. The main character, Ciara, changes in a big way, which obviously not only gives the story a different direction to take, but falls into the annoying category of changing a character for the sake of gaining more of an audience, or just for the sake of it. Sorry, but, I truly wish authors would keep their characters who they are, and not what they believe readers want them to be. Thankfully, characters like Sookie Stackhouse won\u2019t ever become a vampire because the author doesn\u2019t believe it will do the story justice. Will Ciara\u2019s character and personality change as well? One can only hope that she doesn\u2019t suddenly gain unbelievably corny powers over other vampires and humans as well. I don\u2019t want to read the next book and find that Ciara suddenly has clairvoyant or precognitive abilities all of a sudden.The first two novels in the WVMP series have surrounded the DJ\u2019s themselves. The DJ Vampires are Shane, Regina, Jim, Monroe, Noah, and Spencer, along with Jeremy, who is the only human, but wants desperately to become a vampire. The fact that they are vampires, who play the music of the generation for when they were changed, made it just that much more fun to read about. I\u2019ve always loved that about this series. I liked the fact that none of the vamps play, or have the same tastes. I like the different chapters being formulated around actual music and bands for which I\u2019ve followed for many years.One of the more interesting facts about the vampires is the side-effect of being a vampire. It includes psychological ticks and oddities \u2013 OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) in various forms like when Ciara knocks over pencils and Regina is forced to stop and pick them up.Ciara main squeeze has continued to be 90\u2019s DJ and vampire Shane McAllister. Things go way deeper with their relationship in this book, and Shane is forced to look at his beliefs about GOD and the next world. Ciara and Shane\u2019s happiness is put on hold in wake of a chicken pox pandemic spreading through Sherwood. Ciara never had chicken pox as a child, and she is exposed to it. This leads to a wild story where zombies are called forth by a vampire necromancer, and the DJ\u2019s themselves, find themselves on the front lines of a major battle to save their city.It\u2019s awfully hard not to spoil things when reviewing this book, so, I\u2019ll just stop here and say that yes, Ciara and Shane\u2019s romance goes into orbit, and it\u2019s hot and steamy which will please the PNR lovers. It\u2019s also about faith and belief. Something you really don\u2019t find in these kinds of books. Shane, as you know, as always felt that he was damned to hell for being a vampire. Now with the direction that this story has taken, he will have to rethink that faith yet again if he expects to have a HEA with Ciara.I enjoyed the additional story lines for Regina and the rest of the DJ\u2019s, especially a steamy scene between Regina and Ciara. I didn\u2019t enjoy the creepiness that is Jim\u2019s attempts at lurking Ciara into his web of bizarreness, or the fact that he might be insane. Of course, there is a small cliff hanger of sorts when Ciara\u2019s boss informs her that they found something in her blood that she needs to know, then promptly walks off the stage without telling her anything more. Let it bleed will be the 4th installment in the WVMP series and it is expected to release August 2011/\u2022Lust for Life \u2014 Fall 2012 (final novel in series)"}, {"userName": "Teresa Mary Rose", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6054096-teresa-mary-rose", "userReview": "More Reviews Here: Readers Live A Thousand LivesBring On The Night was another great installment in the WVMP Radio series. These books continue to be addictive in the best way possible. The characters continue to be wonderfully developed and the plot will not let you down. It is very different from the last two in the series and Jeri adds another paranormal twist into the mix here. So, please do yourself a favor and read this book.One of my favorite aspects of Bring On The Night is that three years have passed since the last book. A lot has happened in those three years and I loved getting a look into these characters futures. Most series take place over a relatively short amount of time, so some aspects have to be assumed (like you have to assume the relationship is going to last.) However, you didn\u2019t have to do that here, you were able to see that Ciara and Shane made it three years, so if the book ends with them together it isn\u2019t a stretch of the imagination to think that they are in for the long haul. Hopefully that convoluted thought made sense.I also truly enjoyed that Jeri expanded the paranormal aspect outside of simply vampires. Now we get zombies as well and personally I think zombies are awesome. They have become my newest obsession, so that was a pleasant surprise for me. I always love books that acknowledge the fact that if vampires exist, well then isn\u2019t it possible that everything else does as well. I must say, that out of all the paranormal creatures she could have chosen, zombies is probably one of the best. They are not as overdone as witches, werewolves, and angels; so it gave the series a refreshing twist.This book truly surprised me by being nothing what I expected it to be, and I loved that. I love pleasant surprises (bad ones are no fun.) Since I jumped right into Bring On The Night after Bad to the Bone, I did not read the blub for it. Therefore, going into the book I expected a lot of the book to deal with Ciara and her training at Control. I thought that the mystery would take place during her training and that it would deal with sabotaging other agents or something like that. So naturally I was surprised when all of Ciara\u2019s training takes place within one chapter at the very beginning of the book. Instead of what I expected, I got something that was so much better. I got a mystery with lots of twists and turns and a book that nearly broke my heart but at the same time made me laugh.Ciara has grown a lot since the last book. She has managed to stay in a long term relationship with Shane, despite her commitment issues. She has come a long way since her con-artitst days. She is still a super strong character and I truly appreciate her wit. However, this book lets us see Ciara break a little bit and that was something different. She is less sure of herself and gets lost for a little bit. It made Ciara seem more realistic to me, because everybody can break at some point.Shane continues to be one of my favorite characters in the history of the world. Jeri did a fabulous job with him and she managed to pull together a bunch of great characteristics. However, he is not too perfect and that makes him believable. He makes mistakes and at one point I was a tad disappointed in him. However, those little speeches he makes are just made of swoon and those clearly make up for every time I start to get upset with him (which, let\u2019s be honest, is not often.) Along with more yummy Shane, we see a lot more of the other vampires in this one. I enjoyed getting to know them all better and seeing what their life is like. In particular, I really began to appreciate Spencer\u2019s character in this one. As one final character note, Dexter the lovable vampire dog is still great.All in all, the WVMP Radio series continues to be highly addictive.

A steady job at WVMP, the Lifeblood of Rock 'n' Roll. A loving relationship with the idiosyncratic but eternally hot DJ Shane McAllister. A vampire dog who never needs shots or a pooper-scooper. And after nine years, it looks as if she might actually finish her bachelor's degreeBut fate has other plans for Ciara. First she must fulfill her Faustian bargain with the Control, the paranormal paramilitary agency that does its best to keep vampires in line. Turns out the Control wants her for something other than her (nonexistent) ability to kick undead ass. Her anti-holy blood, perhaps? Ciara's suspicions are confirmed when she's assigned to a special-ops division known as the Immanence Corps, run by the Control's oldest vampire and filled with humans who claim to have special powers. To a confirmed skeptic like Ciara, it sounds like a freak fest. But when a mysterious fatal virus spreads through Sherwood--and corpses begin to rise from their graves--Ciara will not only get a crash course in zombie-killing, but will be forced to put her faith, and her life itself, in the hands of magic.Why did I pick this?It should be obvious. If it isn't, I'll explain....this series rocked my face off. I read all of them one right after the other. I couldn't stop. I just had to know what happens.What did I think?Out of all of the books in this series, this one was my favorite. There was so much going on. I loved every word and I devoured it.Shane and Ciara seriously get better with every book. I absolutely adore their characters. They are so perfect for each other and it was so much fun reading Ciara almost just play it off. The emotions that were rolling off these pages was really intense at times. This book had me laughing, crying, and wanting to toss my book in frustration at times. But this book was nothing but badass. Oh how I simply cannot get enough of Franklin in this book. The interactions that he has with Ciara are my most treasured. They always make me laugh. Franklin adds that certain something that is part of the glue that holds this book together. I loved reading more about him and seeing a glimpse of his personality and personal life. He has to be one of my favorite characters ever. He holds a special place in my heart. Especially after this book. This book had my heart racing and my mind reeling the entire time. Non. Stop. Action. Oh! And ZOMBIES! Once I read there were zombies, it kicked this book from badass to EPIC. This series is totally going into my favorite series category. It's just so different than anything I've read before. I've said this before and I'll probably say it a lot more, but when you start reading for a blog, you read ALOT. Sometimes the stories start to sound the same. Now, that's not saying the authors are stealing ideas, it's just they have the same concept. This series broke the mold and it blew my mind.I encourage you to read this series. Seriously. Do it. You won't regret it.Favorite Quote:\"I was just playing.\" The gob of drool on my chin made me a liar. \"When's he coming back?\"\"I know cheerleaders are an auto-uncool in your grunge-boy book,\" I told Shane,\" and you never would've looked at me twice. At football games you would've been too busy getting stoned under the bleachers with your ironic friends, making fun of everyone in school spirit.\" ...\"I would've looked at you,\" Shane said finally. \"A lot more than once.\""}, {"userName": "Meaghan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3282080-meaghan", "userReview": "This book is the third installment in the WVMP series and in my opinion it is the best one. That summary up there is good, but it does not even come close to summing up everything that happens in this book. There is also one EVENT (I put in all caps because it is a big deal) that I am not even going to attempt to talk about because I would not want this surprise ruined for me, so I am not going to do that to you. Let me just say, it is big and you will definitely know it when it happens.I will not talk about aforementioned event, but I will talk about other things in the book that I liked. I did like that this book fast forwards to two and a half years after the last book, because Ciara has established a routine in her life and her con-artist past has not made her run yet. She is doing the one thing that that scares every ex con artist, establishing roots. She and Shane are still living together and his post-it notes have not managed to drive her insane, but the time has come for her to start training to be a member of Control. Ciara manages to get a reduced training time and only has to be there for a month, but she is miserable for every second of it. Once she finally does get to go home, she is met with strange behavior in her home town. People keep dying from some mysterious mutation of chicken pox and some of those deaths hit a little close to home. I was actually surprised by some of the deaths in this book, which makes me sad because I, of course, don\u2019t like seeing people die. I do however, like the fact that Jeri does not let everyone have happy endings. I know that sounds sick, but things in life are not always happy and it makes the story more real for me when there are low points.There are issues that have been building since book one and they are starting to cause major problems. While they do play some part in this story I have a feeling they will continue to gain speed and snowball in future books. Jim has definitely been one of those issues. His anger and bullying habits have been there from the beginning, but I think his age is starting to show and he is turning into something different than he once was. I have a feeling this is going to blow up big time in the next book, but I guess time will tell on that one.I have also loved watching Shane and Ciara grow together. Shane helps Ciara get over her trust issues and Ciara is working on teaching Shane things from this century. They compliment each other very well and are learning how to be in a relationship together. However, their relationship is put to the test in this book because \u201cthe event\u201d has them both questioning what they believe in and how they are going to get through it as a couple. I am not going to say more then that, so you will have to read and see what I mean.I don\u2019t really think I can talk about this much more, because I want to talk about what happens and that will just ruin it. So just know that after chapter 16, Ciara\u2019s world gets rocked! I was almost flipping pages too fast to see what was going to happen. So, here is my advise:1. Go read the first two books, Wicked Game and Bad to the Bone2. Then go read Bring on the NightYou will be so happy you did it. Jeri has put a new spin on the whole vampire myth, that is refreshing and addictive. Plus, you will not have to read all these reviews and go \u201cwhat is the event\u201d because you will know and be happy"}, {"userName": "Vi (the Vi3tBabe)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4487246-vi-the-vi3tbabe", "userReview": "As I\u2019m working my way through this series, I have to say that I\u2019m really liking it a lot more. I found myself more interested and engrossed with Bring on the Night as I kept reading it. Maybe it was because the characters were more established or that the plot is pretty unique and entertaining, but this one definitely held my attention a lot longer than the first two did. I think it was because this book takes place a few years after the last one left off, a lot of things have changed and I think it was the confusion of not knowing and the shock of learning what has happened since then that got me engrossed in this one. Jeri continues to amaze me with her ability to create a fun and riveting story with equally intriguing characters. One thing I\u2019m learning is that I can never know what to really expect from each book in this series. After reading the synopsis, I usually have a good picture in my head of how things will turn out, but Jeri flips it in a whole other direction and I really love how she surprises me.Ciara is one character I am really growing to love. I always liked her from the beginning, but her life was still very much superficial in the previous books. Here, you see a whole other side to her, for obvious reasons you\u2019ll see once you read the book, and I loved learning more about her character and seeing how she handles her situation with Shane and the growing threats that surround her life. She faces some pretty tough decisions in this book and a lot of things change, but I think Jeri handled it in a great way. I\u2019m also really starting to like Shane more. You can see how much he really cares for Ciara and the lengths he\u2019ll go to in order to make her happy and keep her safe, and vice versa.As always, my favorite part of the story would have to be the slew of vampire DJs. They are all so lively and different, and they each get a good amount of time \u201cin the spotlight\u201d, which is great because I love it when an author can write a story with an ensemble cast, and do it well. I don\u2019t know about you, but I think my favorite secondary character is Regina. She\u2019s one of those caring, understanding characters who tries to hide it with a tough exterior and I liked that about her. She definitely steps it up for Ciara in this one and I liked how their relationship progresses. I also liked Jeri\u2019s take on zombies, what brings them back to life, how they survive, etc. It was different, in a good way, and watching the whole \u201cvampires vs. zombies\u201d thing play out was pretty cool.Overall, I definitely found myself becoming more of a fan of this series after reading this book. I don\u2019t know if I just wasn\u2019t paying enough attention in the previous books, but this one felt like a turning point for me, and things just clicked better and I got invested in the story and the characters a lot more than I did before. I really want to see how it all ends and exactly what kind of antics and craziness Ciara and the gang get into next. Bring on the Night is filled with hilarious dialogue, quite a few insane twists, and enough sexual tension to rile you all up. I really enjoyed this one and am so glad I\u2019m sticking through this series."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2293281-brooke", "userReview": "Ciara Griffin is an ex-con artist, but now she is spending her time differently. Trying to finish up her bachelors degree, enjoying living with her vampire/DJ boyfriend Shane McAllister and their vampire dog Dexter, and training for the paranormal paramilitary agency, the Control. Life is busy for Ciara and it is about to get crazy on top of that. A strange and fatal virus starts spreading all over her city of Sherwood leaving no human safe, and someone is causing corpses to rise from their graves leaving no one, not even vampires safe.This is probably one of the hardest book reviews I have had to write in a really long time. I have literally sat here staring at my monitor for an hour and just thinking about what I just read. The problem is, the teeniest of details could totally spoil the whole book for readers. My goal here is to tell you how wonderful this book is without spoiling you, and convincing you to run out and buy it right now! How about I just tell you, RUN OUT AND BUY THIS NOW! Did it work? Hm, fine, here is my review.Bring on the Night is the third installment in the WVMP Vampires series. The absolutely best part about these books are the characters. Jeri Smith-Ready writes them in a realistic way making their personalities shine through, and as a reader you get to know all their quirks and what makes them special. They feel like friends and you end up caring about what happens to each one of them. In Bring on the Night readers get to see a deeper side of the DJs and gain a better understanding of what they go through daily.One of the most important parts, for me, was that the characters have to dive in and face their fears. The fear of losing someone, whether it be to death or from growing apart. The fear of their faith or lack of faith shaping their lives and making them into people they don't really want to be. And the fear of not living up to the expectations put in place for them by their elders. In Bring on the Night we really get into Ciara's head and see what she is feeling about her lack of faith, her relationship with Shane, and what scares her most.The plot has many twists and turns but these unfolding events never seem forced, but like the natural progression the characters and the story should take. I really respect this part of the books, because I never feel like the author is a dummy (or thinks I, as a reader, am the dummy) and didn't think fully about what she was writing or find other ways to move the plot forward.Overall this series is still one of my favorites. I love that each chapter is a song title, and it's relevant to what is going on in that chapter. I can't wait to see what unfolds for Ciara in the future, because things are sure to get more hectic for her after events in Bring on the Night. :)If you're looking for spoilers, Jeri Smith-Ready is going to have a discussion, probably on her Facebook, that will have spoilers. For now, they are supposed to stay under wraps! I will let everyone know when the spoiler discussion is up, no worries."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2938528-kim", "userReview": "The third book in the amazing WVMP series brought so many new aspects to the table, I couldn't put it down! Our favourite Vampire DJs are back and dealing with more trouble than they've faced before. I loved every moment. There's a bit of a time jump between books 2 and 3, and I'll admit I thought I'd missed something at first. I was almost certain there was more to the story than what was in front of me - but that was probably because I wanted to see every detail of Ciara and Shane's life, I didn't want to skip anything. Even with the timeline hiccup, I loved where we jumped into the story. Ciara is in the middle of training for her time with The Control, learning the best way to attack and move around rogue vampires. There's action and sarcastic comments right from the start. I love getting straight into a story with action - can't mess up with a few heart pumping scenes. In the previous books we found out that Ciara has special properties within her blood - a gift, a power or just religious scepticism; either way, her blood has vampire healing potential. But it turns out she's not the only one with special gifts. It makes sense that if one person shows up with a power, there might be others out there who also have a little magic...or a lot. Trouble brews for Ciara and the vampire gang when they discover one of these extra powers is necromancy and suddenly protecting the world from vampires doesn't seem so important, not when the necromancers are raising the dead. You would not believe how thrilled I was at a zombie invasion - and I'm not a big zombie fan. I love when authors don't stick to the basics in their series - I've never come across vampires and zombies in the same book. It was fun and exciting and the mystery of who was raising the zombies and how they could be stopped made it so hard to put the book down. Part of me didn\u2019t expect to learn so much about the vampires so soon. Maybe it\u2019s just me \u2013 because I read the series so close together, I still sort of think of the vampires as these mysterious beings, but it shouldn\u2019t have surprised me so much to learn more about them in the third book of a 4 book series. That being said, I loved it! We got to see more of the vampire OCD-ness \u2013 how it begins, the reaction to it, its continued effect on the other vamps. We come across sunlight, more holy relics and even learn about the difference between willing donors and ordinary humans! There\u2019s so much to the WVMP vampires and while \u2018Bring on the Night\u2019 is not the first book to feature newly turned vampires, we definitely learn more this time around. And of course, our favourite DJ vampires are tied up in all the vampire/human/zombie drama - or adding to the drama. Their tight little group is falling apart at times, mostly through Jim, but he's not the only vampire with issues. It's hard not to get frustrated with a couple of DJs, but you have to love most of them in the end. I can't wait to see what happens next. 5/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Roberta R.

Interesting, mostly tridimensional characters. Lots of adrenaline, even in the not-action-driven moments.Cons: More graphic sex scenes in this one (if you aren't into the stuff) - even an almost-threesome with two girls involved. Gorier than the previous chapters. Radio station and music play a big role in the series, but they're less prominent almost nonexistent in this installment.Will appeal to: Those who like this series...duh. I wanted to address another point, but it would be too spoilery...This is darn tough. Because really, writing a review for Bring On The Night means providing a big, huge, ginormous spoiler. Just one thing, but it's the very core of the book. On the other hand, without the spoiler, there would be no review at all. Or maybe...well, since Karen from \"For What It's Worth\", for example, was able to do it, I hope I can figure out a way to do the same thing myself. I'll address the big spoiler in question with *****. Let's see if it works...The novel opens two years after the events that took place in Bad to the Bone. And for the first time, Ciara's narrative mode is the past tense. Only in the last chapter she switches to present tense (this is purposely stressed by the author with the sentence \"Ah, back in the Now, where I belong.\"), and my best guess is that Smith-Ready thought it fit to have Ciara recounting the ***** event as a thing from the past, since at the end of the book she has finally come to terms with it.We left Ciara blackmailed by the Control (see book 1 and 2) into giving them a year's worth of service - and samples of her own blood - in exchange for Shane's well-being. As the book opens, she's completing Indoc(trination) and is going to find out what her final destination is, as far as Control corps are concerned. In the meantime, her relationship with Shane has taken off, and I mean seriously. The station is in the background - big sigh - but anyway, it sounds like everything's going fine there. Though I'm beginning to question the apparent ongoing success of WVMP, what with it being a vintage station in a world where everything grows old so quickly. (Especially since there seemed to be some small problems back in book 2). Maybe the vamps' strong allure makes up for it? Anyway, this almost idyllic setup comes tumbling down when a supposed chicken pox epidemic begins to spread around and people start to die. This will have a mighty impact on the WVMP happily dysfunctional family, and will change forever the lives - or unlives - of some of its members.

(And that is possibly the worst opening sentence I've ever written for a review.) Fortunately, she is a much better writer than I am. If you haven't read any of this series yet, make your way over to Wicked Game and start there. You'll want to follow these characters from their literary genesis.The problem with reviewing Bring on the Night is trying to write a meaningful review while avoiding spoilers about some pretty big plot points. Rest easy; I won't give away anything juicy here.For the first couple of chapters, I struggled with this book, the way I often do with new entries in series. I have a horrible memory and it takes some time for me to remember who all the people are and what has happened to them up to this point. Fortunately, Smith-Ready has cooked up a memorable cast of characters, on down to the supporting cast, and it didn't take long for me to get drawn back into their world, even if I couldn't remember the detailed plot points of the previous two books.Once I was hooked back in, Bring on the Night grabbed me and wouldn't let go. This is easily the best of the series so far. We're introduced to some undead of an entirely different stripe, which is cool, but more important than our new baddies is the fact that our familiar characters gain a new depth here. We've had two previous volumes to get to know them; now we're getting an even more satisfying, emotional look at them, and it pays off big time.Smith-Ready takes some chances here and doesn't fall victim to the \"everything is the same in the end\" trap of series fiction. Because of that, the vampire DJs at WVMP seem like real people, and our main character Ciara comes alive in entirely new ways. Her character development is fantastic here.As always, Smith-Ready gifts us with a playlist to accompany the story. Do yourself a favor and listen while you're immersed in the book. Follow the characters as they  Tweet if you're so inclined. You can dismiss these things as accessories, but I see them as a brilliant way of fleshing out a fictional world. That kind of immersion is only going to make this ride even more fun.

Honestly, I\u2019m not sure why there is such a big gap between books 2 and 3. Several times during the first few chapters I checked to make sure I hadn\u2019t missed an entire book (I hadn\u2019t) or maybe a bridging novella somewhere (nope). There easily could have been another book, or two, before this one, but it feels almost like when a TV show gets cancelled and the writers throw all the major plot developments that they\u2019d been saving into the last few episodes. That\u2019s not the case with BRING ON THE NIGHT since there are already two more books planned for this series, but it feels like it.So here we are, 2 1/2 years down the road, Ciara is finishing up her mandatory orientation/boot camp for the Control, Shane has been rebuilding his relationship with his human family, and he and Ciara are living together in domestic bliss with their vamp dog Dexter. Life couldn\u2019t be better until the dead start rising, and the living start succumbing to lethal virus of mysterious origins. BRING ON THE NIGHT is a game changer for the series in a lot of ways (several I which I can\u2019t even begin to talk about with out spoiling the entire book). Characters evolve and reveal themselves in surprising yet satisfying ways, decisions are made that will irrevocably change the lives of everyone at WVMP Radio, lives are lost, new love is found, and nothing will ever be the same. As vague as I\u2019m forced to be in this review, I can say that BRING ON THE NIGHT is the best in the series to date, and I really love how Jeri fearlessly made some tough, bold changes this time out that have paid off in the most exciting installment yet. I still question the big time gap between books, and the \u201cbad guy\u201d was little more than a convenient prop for a different plot element, but for me, a new and much needed energy has been injected into this series. Book 4, tentatively titled LET IT BLEED, will be released Summer 2011, and after BRING ON THE NIGHT it\u2019s anyone's guess what will happen next.Sexual Content: References to homosexuality.

This is a great series and Bring on the Night did not disappoint. As a matter of fact, I think it' my favorite of the three books in the series so far. If you haven't read this series before, the (very) basic premise is that the radio DJs at this station are all vampires. Each is from a different era, and in this world vampires are \"stuck\" in the era they died in, they have a lot of trouble with change (and OCD). Ciara is an employee of the radio station, and dates one of the DJs, sexy Shane (he's stuck in the 80s). Needless to say, each book has a great soundtrack!There is a lot going on in this book but Ms. Smith-Ready makes it flow smoothly:~Ciara's started her service with the Control, and she's been assigned to the super-secret division, which she's not happy about.~There is a mysterious illness spreading around the town that is killing residents, including some who are very close to Ciara.~There are zombies - I'm not gonna lie, there is one particular scene were the zombies cracked me up, I could just imagine the looks on the faces of the characters in the book while they watched what was going on!~One of the vampire DJs goes missing.~Shane and Ciara's relationship takes some pretty major turns, and they are both forced into serious soul searching.You know how sometimes you read a book and you really like it but there are parts you kinda skim *cough~lessers~cough*? I didn't do that here at all. Ms. Smith-Ready weaves such a good story I had no need nor want to skim. Now, honestly, I kind of guessed some of the plot, but I didn't know how Ms. Smith-Ready was going to take me there; the journey was completely enjoyable. (I can't go into specifics without giving away spoilers, but her attention to the nuances of the vampire OCD habits is always fascinating.) I read this book everywhere: at work, at home, the grocery store, waiting at the shuttle stop near my job... I had four pages until the end of the book when I got off the shuttle and had to wait about three hours until I could pick the book backup again and finish.

Needless to say, it is impossible to be specific about anything that happened in this book without there being spoilers. In the interest of NOT being that person that messes up your reading experience, then, I will instead focus on how BRING ON THE NIGHT is yet another example of Jeri Smith-Ready\u2019s world-building and characterization talent.You would think that two people as in love as Ciara and Shane are with each other would get boring after a while, but this standout couple proves us wrong again and again. What makes Ciara and Shane consistently interesting is their deeply rooted differences\u2014specifically, their faith, or the lack thereof. Shane\u2019s struggle with the morality of vampirism as a result of his Catholic upbringing brings to mind other vampires\u2019 famous moral conflicts (Edward Cullen, anyone?). It results in us occasionally wanting to just swat him upside the head and tell him to lighten up, you\u2019re killing the mood\u2014but damn, this boy is just completely and utterly adorable, the perfect guy to counterbalance Ciara\u2019s recklessness and skepticism. And did I mention that he\u2019s a talented musician as well?The central plot pertaining to the zombies feels a little far-fetched at times, but mostly because they all play second fiddle to The Thing That Happens that I can\u2019t tell you about. Still, it doesn\u2019t take too much for us to adjust our knowledge of Ciara\u2019s world to accommodate zombies and whatever else Jeri might want to throw at us next. That\u2019s the beauty of her books: from the beginning, she weaves a world so complete that it begins to take on a life of its own, allowing us readers to stretch it as needed for us to believe in it. The strongest structures aren\u2019t necessarily the most rigid: they\u2019re the ones with just enough give and flexibility to absorb any shocks and new material.BRING ON THE NIGHT marks a big change for Ciara, Shane, and all the other characters whom we\u2019ve come to love.

Much to her chagrin, she is stationed with the Immanence Corps, a group filled of vampires and humans with special abilities. However, before she can get officially \"signed\" in, a insanely virus starts sweeping her campus. At first the doctors think its chicken pox, but when it starts killing people within hours of the onset of symptoms they quickly realize this virus is something more. Long story short, Ciara is one of the few at a major risk. Some major events happen that start a tailspin that will leave everyone forever change.I'm having a hard time talking about this book without spoiling anything, it just really was that eventful. The book at its core is really mostly about belief and faith. As we know from the previous books, Shane has it and Ciara has the absolute opposite. It is her utter lack of faith that allows her blood to heal vampires from holy wounds. Due to the events in this book, her lack of faith is challenged, and for the first time in her life she finds herself wanting to believe in something.The characters in this series will just grip you and make you care so much for them. Each one's personality is completely unique and I found myself loving each and every one of them despite their quirks. In this book, we get a closer look at the DJs and who they really are. I also loved the progression in Shane and Ciara's relationship. It took leaps forward, and well, backwards as well. Everything between them feels so real, and I really enjoyed seeing them together. The road between them will still be long and I'm sure filled with potholes, but I think it will be a journey worth spending.I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

Ciara is just a few credits away from graduating which also means she';ll soon begin working for Control, the agency that tries to keep vampires under control and a secret from the human population. She's still seeing her vampire DJ boyfriend, Shane, and they are happy together. Her best friend Lori is engaged. So of course the crap hits the fan. There's a mysterious plague killing people in a matter of hours, zombies are being forced to rise, and several major, life altering events happen in Ciara's life.We spend a lot of time with the radio station vampires and see some of them in a new light, which I enjoyed and there's lots of Lori time too. I liked seeing Ciara's interactions with her human best friend and the vampires in her life. Ciara is not the same person she was when the series started - she no longer cons people for a living, she has people she cares about, and has made a home and a life for herself. She's having some trouble adjusting to these changes in her life and then life throws more changes at her. She and Shane have issues to work out, including their differing religious beliefs, and what they want out of their relationship.There are several recurring themes in the book - belief, trust, redemption, hope, community, and faith. Ciara deals with all of these in the course of the book and her decisions reflect her growth and her personality. Smith-Ready wraps all this philosophy in a story full of surprises, action, romance and humor. It was an easy, engaging twisty, read that kept me turning the pages to see what happened next. I'm glad I have the next book so I don't have to wait to find out how the series ends!"}, {"userName": "Kimberly Callegan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4994465-kimberly-callegan", "userReview": "Co-reviewed with blogging partner Britney Wyatt.Slap our ass and call us pizzazz!!

If I have my facts right, this will not be the last in the series, there is currently a novella online on Jeri's blog, along with the last full book coming out sometime next year.BOTN was another fantastic book in the series, but it was darker and sadder than the first two. I know many, many people who ranked BOTN as their favorite in the series, and I really liked it, too. But it did have a bit of shift in the tone and added a few more paranormal elements. I think this was great for the series, and it was definitely the most emotional of the books, and will most likely make the end of the series even better. But it was SAD (and not for the reasons you think, so don't think I'm getting spoilery here)!! Again, not a bad thing at all, and I know it had to do more with what I was in the mood for in my reading. It kinda reminds me of what I was feeling while reading Blood Promise in the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead. It was an excellently written book and had necessary story elements that made the ending of the series SPECTACULAR, and for that reason I loved it, but it wasn't my favorite in the series.I will stop rambling now! And like I said, most people love this book above all the others, but for me, Bad to the Bone is still my favorite!"}, {"userName": "Bron", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4621158-bron", "userReview": "Bring on the Night is about Ciara, a once upon a time con artist who is dating a vampire. In this world of vampires, there is an agency called \"Control\" that watches over the vampires and makes sure they assimilate correctly into society. Apparently this is necessary as the vampires tend to get stuck in the decade they were turned in. They then have difficulties accepting new styles and coping with modern electronic equipment. It almost sounds like they are any normal human, wanting the sounds and styles from when we are in our teens and twenties for the rest of our lives. Also the inability of older people to handle electronic equipment is just the same!!Ciara's town is threatened with a deadly mutant strain of chicken pox, and she realises that she is in danger as she has no immunity to chicken pox. The story is about Ciara's decision on facing the disease, and how it affects her life forever. As a result of this decision, Shane also becomes part of Control, and the pair are sent out with the rest of their vampire buddies to fight a plague of zombies.I found this in the library, and even though it was the third in a series, decided to get it out and read it. The book wasn't too hard to figure out what was going on, however I did find it lacking in action, and am undecided on whether to read the rest of the series or not."}, {"userName": "marlene", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1846361-marlene", "userReview": "this book picks up years after the last. i was a little skeptical about the time jump but it ende dup being a good thing. we see that ciara and shane are still happy and in love. wiriting any sort of review for this one without including major spoilers is near impossible. i am going to try my best to work around it and be vague.secondary characters that we have seen before really get to shine in this installment. regina, monroe, and the others get to come more into themselves. we see different facets of the characters as they react to the major changes that happen throughout. this was areally pleasant treat. some of the folks who you read about in passing were quickly moved up to starring roles without getting to lost in the plot lines.all of the talk seems to center around ciara and shane. sure, there are some seriously major changes that take place in this book for both of them, but i don't think that all of these avenues will lead to distruction for them either on a singular or together level. i actually think that these changes could be a positive move for both of them. i think overall this was my fave of the series so far. i am looking foward to where the series will end."}, {"userName": "Jacque", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4259122-jacque", "userReview": "Bring On The Night is the third book in the WVMP Radio Series.

It is THAT good. In fact, I would read the final book next if I didn't have other Book Nerd commitments.There is a lapse in time of about two and a half years between books two and three. Ciara is almost finished with her college classes and has started her training to become a Control agent. Shortly after her return to the station, there is an outbreak of chicken pox. This is not your ordinary chicken pox, but a deadly mutation. Several Sherwood residents die, so they quarantine the city.

They need to take emergency action.There is so much more that I want to say, but I don't want to give away any spoilers.

Even though its about vampires, the characters all seem so real. Ciara battle with her changes and didn't just accept them and bounce back like lots of other paranormal heroines.

The further into the book, the deeper their love grew and this line really summed it up for me:He was my Orpheus, leading me out of the Underworld again and again. No matter how far I stepped into the land of the dead, he always found me. - Ciara, about Shane.Another favourite line: \"Ciara.\" He bent low and brushed my lips with nothing but his breath. \"I'd have kicked God's own ass to get you back with me.\" - and if you known anything about Shane, that is a MASSIVE statement!Loved, loved, LOVED this book!!!"}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10365880-caitlin", "userReview": "I felt like this book didn't know where it was going, or what it was trying to be.

I guess I am getting tired of them as this one just didn\u2019t grab me. Ciara is still a loveable klutz who seems to like being flotsam in the stream of life.
