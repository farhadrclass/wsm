Thin, with permed hair, gripping plastic bags with the handles twisted around each other. She'd honed in; there was no hiding his face, and when she spoke he understood her Mandarin. She was lost. Could he help? She needed to make a phone call, find a bus. Her face was scared and anxious. Two teenage boys, pale and gangly, had watched and mimicked her accent, and Daniel had said, in English, \"I can't speak Chinese.\" Afterwards, he tried to forget the woman, because when he did think of her, he felt a deep, cavernous loneliness.\nApologies for the long opening quote, but I felt this one small scene beautifully captured the feel of The Leavers. It is a sad book about immigration and identity, made even more poignant by the lack of emotional manipulation. It doesn't feel driven by an agenda; it just feels like a story about some people. And, because of that, it feels true.It is a quiet tale, driven by its characters and subtle exploration of race and belonging. There are two stories being told-- that of Deming Guo, whose mother disappears one day and leaves him to be adopted by white, upper middle class Americans, and that of his mother, Polly Guo, who comes to America from Fuzhou to find a better life for herself and her then unborn son.At its heart, The Leavers is a story of constantly feeling out of place. Even when Deming Guo becomes Daniel Wilkinson and attends the schools his adoptive family choose for him, he is still not quite American enough for the world he keeps trying to adapt to. His parents, Peter and Kay, are well-meaning but participate in and encourage racial microaggressions, believing their disdain for poor Mexican workers to be harmless banter; believing their American \"Chinese\" food to be an adequate way to bring Deming/Daniel closer to his birth culture.But when Deming later finds himself in Fuzhou, he realizes that his home isn't there either. Looking Chinese but talking American means he doesn't really fit in anywhere.And Polly, too, feels out of place. Her options as a single pregnant woman in China are poor, but New York is a terrifying and often unfriendly city. She watches her son become better and better at speaking English, and feels herself left behind, struggling to communicate with him as he becomes ever more part of a world she will never belong to.Then, beneath the issues of immigration, race and identity, there is simply the story of a mother and her son, the love between them, and the effects of them being ripped apart. As a daughter, the worst thing that could have possibly happened to me at Deming's age was to lose my mother. I would have lost my anchor, my constant, my entire world. Now, as a mother, there is nothing worse I can imagine than losing my child. To have someone else raise him and, perhaps, most torturously, offer him better than I could... it brings me an almost physical pain to just imagine it. This book tapped into that.The Leavers somehow both sheds a light on the reality of the immigrant experience for many, AND manages to be a universal, painfully-human story. It is at once eye-opening and relatable, and it affected me deeply.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Wow!!... This book is a kindle special for $1.99 today. If you haven\u2019t read it yet - have a kindle - grab it for this price!!! It\u2019s a GREAT BOOK! I thought I was the fool for waiting so long to read it. It was only after I touched the hardback in my indi Book store -- silky smooth to touch... gorgeous vibrant orange color...stamped as an \"Literary Award Winner\"....did I ask myself, \"what the hell is wrong with you?\" Why was I hesitating reading this book? I knew about it - read a few things about this story - Great Reviews-- but I THOUGHT I HAD READ ENOUGH DEBUT NOVELS ABOUT IMMIGRANTS- legal 'or' illegal!!! WHAT ELSE WAS I POSSIBLY GOING TO LEARN? WHAT COULD I *REALLY* TAKE AWAKE FROM THIS BOOK THAT I HAVEN'T FROM EVERY OTHER WITH SIMILAR THEMES OF HARDSHIPS - DEBT- MEAGER EXISTENCE- STRUGGLES.....unraveling of The American Dream??? Would I end up just feeling sad - and that life is frickin unfair? -- and VERY HARD for some people??? Or maybe -- ( oh God, just maybe one of these books WILL be THE BOOK THAT MAKES THE POWERFUL GLOBAL SHIFTING DIFFERENCE?)...... Well, I DID SHIFT!!! I AM DIFFERENT than when I started this novel. I hope my local book club picks 'Lisa Ko's, \"The Leavers\", for one of our monthly picks. This novel calls for some serious- worthy discussions!!!! First off -- the storytelling is powerful and consistently compelling. Mother and son are both living between two worlds --- there is hardship and triumph- heartbreak and love. There are sooo many things I want to talk about in this novel - I honestly don't know where to begin - EVERY CHARACTER is so vivid - real - so fully developed-- we could talk about each 'one' of them -in length from many perspectives. Pelican, for example, is a fascinating woman -restless spirit-independent thinker -liked to curse -could hold a firece grudge. Leon reminded me of a man that tried so hard to please everyone -Deming was my hero in ways. No kid was 'left' more. He grows up as Daniel with new parents Peter and Kate.... ( who have their own issues about parenting). All the supporting characters.....Michael - Roland - Angel - Vivian - etc. add to this story and are also in your thoughts. It's impossible to say all I want to say in this review-- so I'm going to add a 'few' things that have changed me PERSONALLY FOREVER..... Rather than tell about the details of this story....( I'm guessing you can find that in other reviews).....I going to share a few GUT WRENCHING images that I've taken away:  NOBODY comes to America hoping to pick gao gao out of strangers toes and scraping calluses the size of a nose off of the heel of a woman's heel..... ONLY TO GET A SHIT TIP!!!!! NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO WORK A 6 HOUR SHIFT IN A FACTORY WITHOUT A BREAK!!! I WILL NEVER *EVER* SEE A NAIL SALON THE SAME WAY AGAIN AFTER READING THIS BOOK!  WORKING IN A SLAUGHTERHOUSE has got to be one of the worse jobs on the planet -- on so many levels: physically, spiritually, emotionally, and mentally. Deming, born in Manhattan, New York, was sent to Minjjang, China, to live with his grandfather for the first six years of his life. Why did Peilan, his undocumented mother stay in America? Why not go back to China with her son where she could have family support raising her son without the separation? I HOPE A MOVIE IS MADE FROM THIS BOOK!!!!! I can see it!!! Exquisitely written ......deeply human meditation on despair, loss, love, immigration, identity, diversity, hope, human longings, consequences, .......multilayered and deeply felt!!!!Thank You Netgalley, Algonquin Books, and Lisa Ko"}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "The Leavers by Lisa Ko is utterly exquisite. This book about two different people's struggle between doing what is right, what people want and expect them to do, and what they want to do, is tremendously moving and powerful. As the title suggests, it's both a story of those who leave and the effect on those who are left.Deming Guo is 11 years old. He's being raised by his mother, Polly, an undocumented Chinese immigrant, and they live in a crowded Bronx apartment with Polly's boyfriend, his sister, and his nephew, who is Deming's surrogate brother. Polly wants more than her exhausting job at a nail salon\u2014she wants the opportunity to make more money and not kill herself in the process. Deming wants his mother to be around more yet he wants her to have the money to give him what he wants.One day, Polly leaves for her job, and never returns. At first, no one is exactly sure where she went. Did she go to Florida to pursue a better job opportunity, and she'll send for Deming when she gets on her feet? But if that's the case, why hasn't she gotten in touch with anyone? Deming doesn't understand why his mother has left him, and bargains with himself constantly that if he does better in school, is nicer to his peers, Polly will return. But she doesn't.When the burden of caring for Deming becomes too much to bear for those left behind, he becomes the foster child of an older couple, Peter and Kay, both college professors, and they convince him that to better adjust and assimilate with his peers in upstate New York, he should change his name to Daniel. Daniel has a great deal of trouble adjusting, however, something that causes Peter and Kay a great deal of difficulty, since they aren't sure if they're even suited to be parents anyway. But still, they adopt Daniel, and pressure him to buckle down academically.The Leavers follows Daniel as he grows into a rudderless young man, torn between wanting to pursue his own dreams and wanting to please his parents, or he's afraid they'll leave him as his mother did. It also traces Daniel's struggles to understand what happened to his mother and deciding if he should try and follow some leads that might have presented themselves to him. The book also follows Polly from her childhood in China to the day she disappeared, and outlines the difficult choices she is forced to make.Ko's storytelling is truly breathtaking, as she has created two characters who capture your heart and will stay in your memory. Neither character is 100 percent admirable, and at times their actions are frustrating, but you understand their struggles and feel for them. And while some of the other characters may make decisions that anger or frustrate, you see that they're also very complex, no matter how much time they're in the book.I absolutely loved this book, and read the entire thing in one sitting while on a plane. I was moved, I was blown away, I wanted to shake the characters and make them act or say the thing that might move things forward, and ultimately, I was sad when I was done. I cannot wait to see what's next for Lisa Ko, because this was one hell of a book.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "Imagine you're a 17 year old girl named Peilan who becomes Polly, and you've come come to the US from China seeking a better life . And oh by the way you're pregnant and here illegally, owing a loan shark $50,000. You have to work long hours in awful working conditions to scrape enough for the payments. You have to bring your infant son to work with you because there is no one to care for him. There are some things that happen in this story that were hard to relate to but then this immigrant experience is so far removed from what I know. This story was an eye opener for sure. Imagine you are a young man named Daniel who was born in Chinatown in Manhattan, sent when he was one year old to live with his grandfather in a village in China and then sent back to his mother at six. That was when he was Deming before his mother disappears when he is eleven. It's been ten years since Peilan has disappeared and Deming is a college student struggling with being abandoned even though adopted. He struggles with his identity, with a gambling addiction, what to do with his life . He remembers when he was with his mother and doesn't understand why she left. At least he has his music. While I'm not a fan of hard rock, it is comforting to know that Deming's music is something he can hold on to . \" He would learn how to create music, matching tones to shades to feelings and translating them back to melody. ...He'd craft songs that conveyed exactly what he wanted to say....the rest of the world heard only sound, and that would leave him with lingering sadness...\".The story is told from their two points points of view, a third person narrative from Deming's perspective and then a first person narrative by his mother. The common thread is their love for each other and their memories of each other. This is a sad story in many ways depicting the separation of a mother and child. It isn't until later in the story that we learn what happened to Peilan. I not going to say much more about the plot. Suffice it to say, this is a moving view of immigrants, a timely one. Lisa Ko does a good job of helping us imagine these lives. A striking debut, recognized by Barbara Kingsolver as the winner of the 2016 PEN/Bellwether Prize for fiction as a novel that addresses social injustice.

That morning, he went to school and she went to work. The difference? He came home. \"The Leavers\" is a coming of age story about a Chinese American boy named Deming Guo (n/k/a Daniel Wilkinson). Deming had to grow up faster, and learn to shut off his feelings and thoughts in a way that no child ever should. He and his mother Peilan (Polly) were always very close. They were, like two birds of a feather, two peas in a pod, best friends. They lived in an apartment with Polly's boyfriend Leon, his sister Vivian and her son, Michael and they became an instant family. The day his mother failed to come home, everything changed. His life was taken away and all of a sudden, he was sent to live with Peter and Kay Wilkinson and he became Daniel Wilkinson. Peter and Kay tried to \"Americanize\" him. Thereafter, Daniel struggled to find himself and be accepted by his \"parents.\"Polly Guo's history was a difficult one. Moving to New York, alone and pregnant, working menial jobs, while speaking very little English? Its hard to imagine.. yet it happens everyday. Her struggles were real. And she faced them alone. This is a story about family, the family you are born with v. the family that you're given. You know the saying, you give what you give and you get what you get. Every. Single. Character. in this book can identify with that. It's also a story about choices. The choices we make v. the choices that are made for us.  It's a story about letting go when doing so seems like an impossible feat. And last but not least, its a story about our hopes and our fears as well as loss and love and how we handle both. To summed it up, it's a story that touched me in a myriad of ways. And I am better for it. Lisa Ko has written an exquisite novel. And a debut at that! Her words envelop you. They evoke emotions that are so rarely felt.  The characters are rich, well thought out, descriptive, beautiful. That's not to say that they are all perfect however, some are quite flawed. And well, Human. I listened to the audiobook (the narrator was phenomenal) and I will be buying the hardcover simply because I must have a copy of it for my bookshelf. I can't possibly recommend this novel highly enough. It might just be my favorite book of the year so far.

Even though the blurb and reviews don\u2019t come out and say exactly what happened, a couple of buzz words kept loudly buzzing around in my head. Unfortunately, they landed on the exact right spot. Bingo! I figured out what had happened almost as soon as the story started. It spoiled the mystery, that\u2019s for sure.But luckily this story isn\u2019t primarily a mystery. It\u2019s a well-written and interesting coming-of-age story about a Chinese-American kid, Deming (aka Daniel). It\u2019s also a story about his mom, who disappears when Deming is eleven. I love it when a book lets me peek into lives that are so different from mine. Oh god, that sounds so sweet and touristy. Sure, I appreciate, like a detached but curious student of anthropology, a fine peeky-peek into their every-day lives. But way more important is the shiver I feel when I sternly glare at some atrocities, some rugged truths, they faced. I\u2019ll stay vague here, on purpose, so don't ask. I\u2019m dying to talk about this book\u2014so please read it soon! The story makes you think about a lot of things\u2014what home means, what belonging to a tribe means, how it feels to try to become part of another tribe, how it feels to be separated from those you love. Deming had such a rough deal. I can imagine how sad and hard it was for him to be constantly wondering where his mother had gone, and why. Did she abandon him because she didn\u2019t love him? Did she get killed? The uncertainty was there, torturing him, for a long time. Daniel faces some heavy stuff\u2014the loss of a mother, the oddness and awkwardness of being adopted, and guilt over not getting his act together. And of course confusion over who he was, where he was going, what he wanted to do. Throughout most of the story, he\u2019s sad, lonely, and insecure. He feels alienated. Could anyone blame him, though, since his mom disappeared out of thin air and he was suddenly thrown into a whole different culture? One drawback\u2014I didn\u2019t relate to or particularly like Deming or his mother. They both seemed stoical, which made me feel stoical and detached in return. Still, there were well-drawn and complex characters. I don\u2019t have to love the characters to love the book. Deming\u2019s life was pretty quiet, but his mother\u2019s life, now that\u2019s a different story. Her life had been riveting and I was completely drawn in. I had pretty strong emotions about her, and they weren\u2019t all positive. I\u2019m not proud to say it but I was constantly judging how good a mother she had been. At the same time, I felt so deeply for all she had to endure, and I felt really sick about the brutal unfairness she faced. As the story progressed, I started to understand her choices and cut her some slack. Her powerful story isn\u2019t told until the last part of the book, though, so I had to spend most of my time hanging out with Deming. Structurally, it makes perfect sense to have the mom\u2019s story at the end. I just wish I had cared more about Deming.The language is straightforward. Maybe a bit too much description, but it\u2019s done well so I didn\u2019t get bored. There are super nice metaphors throughout, though there was one time the author went overboard. She uses multiple metaphors to describe a view of the city. I had to construe too many disparate images in my mind. Seriously, she compared things to masking tape, a greeting card, and a band of mismatched toys all in one paragraph. My mind was jumping all over the place! Using just one metaphor would have been a lot stronger. The paragraph seemed sophomoric, like an exercise you\u2019d have in a creative writing class. Maybe the author was over-enjoying her skill of being able to describe things in a super interesting way. Kill your darlings, I want to whisper to the author, it will be okay. Luckily I only experienced (or tuned in on?) the metaphor madness that one time.I loved that the story mostly took place in New York City (which might be my favorite story locale ever), and I was fascinated when the story moved to China.I recently read and enjoyed the short-story collection, The Refugees. Although the stories have a different feel and focus, that book is similar to this one in that it\u2019s about Asians coming to America. Both books are excellent.I purposely tried here to be plenty vague about the plot; I don\u2019t want to spoil it for you. But I will say that this is a really good book that you\u2019ll want to get your hands on. It\u2019s hard to believe this is a debut, but it\u2019s not hard to believe it has already won an award.Thanks to NetGalley for the advance copy.P.S. Does the title bother anyone else? Who has ever heard of leavers? I know it\u2019s a real word, but it sort of sounds made up.

Timely, heartbreaking, and emotional.Polly immigrates to the US from China and is raising her young son Deming, living with her boyfriend, Leon, his sister, Vivian, and her son, Michael. But, one day, after an argument, Polly leaves for work and disappears. With no blood relatives, Deming finds himself at the mercy of Vivian, who says she can\u2019t afford to keep him. However, he does end up in a good home, with Kay and Peter, an educated couple who try their best to offer him a better life. After his adoption, Kay and Peter change his name to Daniel, completing his transformation into their environment. But, all the while, his mother\u2019s fate haunts him. Had she simply abandoned him or did something terrible happen to her? There are many books about mothers and daughters, a relationship often fraught with various juxtapositions, but a bond between a mother and her son, is something we should explore and cheer on more often. In this case, Deming never knew his father, so his mother was his whole world. He struggles to adapt to his new life, bowing under pressure, developing a gambling problem, but finding relief through music. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rocket science to conclude that Deming/Daniel\u2019s unrest, his inability to settle in and focus is wrapped up in his lack of closure concerning his mother, and his struggle with the two sides of him, with his peace of mind remaining elusive. But, by the second part of the story, I began to understand there was more going on that what appears on the surface, shifting the focus onto the broken immigration system, giving Polly a chance to tell her side of the story. She too, struggles with a duality, trying to meld her past self with the woman and the life she has now. Kay and Peter are do gooders, patting themselves on the back for giving Daniel a new life when a younger child was what they would have preferred. Not only that, they project their ideals and perhaps unrealistic expectations onto Daniel, unable to understand his seeming lack of ambition. While, Kay and Peter aren\u2019t necessarily bad people, they aren\u2019t exactly warm and fuzzy either, and although they do put some effort into making him feel more comfortable in his mostly white surroundings, they are perhaps a little credulous. So, ultimately, there really are no bad guys, per se, except for struggles and consequences faced by immigrants, which of course makes this story especially poignant and relevant in this moment in time. There are some parts in the book that went on too long or went into too much detail, especially since it didn\u2019t exactly add a lot to the relevance of the situation, and bordered on \u2018filler\u2019, but that\u2019s really just a minor blip when compared with what I took away from the story.The novel is partly a mystery, since we have no idea what has become of Polly after her vanishing act, but it is mostly a story about the bond between a mother and son, the cause of the heartbreaking rip in their relationship, the resulting fall out, and the struggle to find one\u2019s true identity. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol", "userReview": "With sincere gratitude I thank Algonquin Books, Annie Mazes of Workman Publishing, the author, Lisa Ko, and Edelweiss for providing an e-galley of Leavers for my enjoyment and review.A special shout-out to Northshire Bookstore and Tracy Davies, Events Manager for bringing Kisa Ko to Booktopia 2017 in Manchester, Vermont. I usually format my reviews with The Hook, The Line, and The Sinker. This is difficult to do with galleys as the publisher asks that passages not be quoted, as the finished work may be different.

One day Peilan (Polly) Guo does not come home from work. Having mentioned a plan to seek employment in Florida, Deming is certain this is where she has gone and will soon be home. But why didn\u2019t she tell him she was leaving? As days turn into years, the course of Deming\u2019s life changes in ways we might not suspect.

One day, Polly does not return home from work and no one can find her. Ten years later, Deming is a college student named Daniel. He is struggling with life and has developed a gambling problem. He is uninterested in college, and his friends are tired of his indecisiveness. He is a disappointment to his adoptive parents who have continued to provide support and encouragement throughout the years.

Although she works for a time in a larger city, she continues to long for more. Polly ends up in New York, owing a vast amount of money to loan sharks in order to pursue her dreams. She has a baby boy, Deming, and eventually has to extend her loan to send him back to her father in China until he is school age.When Deming returns, Polly is still living in straitened circumstances and working long hours to repay her loans. When Deming is 11 years old, their world is turned upside down through a series of life-altering circumstances. Deming finds himself adopted into a white family in a small city outside of New York and his adolescence and young adulthood are stained with the thoughts that his mother left him behind due to something he said or did.Through recordings of his adoptive father that Deming (now known as Daniel) discovers, an interest in playing guitar becomes a passion for Daniel. This led me to my own adventures: onto YouTube to watch a documentary on Jimi Hendrix, which led to watching a compilation of outstanding guitar solos with Prince in various concerts. Daniel not only hears the music but he sees it in colors at the same time and it isn\u2019t long before he starts to compose his own music as well.There is much more to the plot and the story moves through time and a few places in the USA and China.

He was born in New York to an undocumented Chinese immigrant, but was sent to live with family in China when he was only one year old. He was sent back to New York to live with his mother when he turned six. Five years later, his mother disappears without a trace. Peilan/Polly Guo left for work one morning and never returned. At the age of eleven, the people he thought were his family place him in the foster care system. He's adopted by a white family in a suburban community. \nYou could play it one way and play it another, the same note sounding different depending on how you decided to hear it. You could try to do all the right things and still feel wrong inside.\nDeming's feelings towards his adoptive parents are complicated. He desperately wants their approval, but he's never sure what they want from him. They mean well and give him a comfortable life, but they\u2019re out of touch. They insist on complete assimilation, even going as far as changing his name to Daniel. Occasionally they try to incorporate their own conception of Chinese culture into his life, but they don't ask for his input and there's no consideration of how varied cultures can be in such a large country. They aren't sensitive to his unique circumstances and develop a \"colorblind\" approach to parenting him. When he overhears a racist comment, his adoptive mother panics and insists that he misheard. She often seems to view life in China as inferior to life in the United States. She doesn't realize her view of China may be biased, that her life isn't the only type of life worth living, or even that her suburban community insulates her from some of the United States' own problems.\nIt was a funny thing, forgiveness. You could spend years being angry with someone and then realize you no longer felt the same, that your usual mode of thinking had slipped away when you weren\u2019t noticing.\nWith all that he's been through in his twenty-one years, it's no surprise that Deming/Daniel struggles with issues of identity and belonging. He blames himself for his mother\u2019s disappearance. He feels unwanted and undeserving of love.\u00a0A fear of letting people down forces him to keep people at an arm's length. When he's uprooted from Chinatown and placed in the predominately white and middle-class\u00a0Ridgeborough, NY, he has to learn to navigate a completely different culture. He endures a constant onslaught of thoughtless comments and is exhausted by being both invisible and conspicuous at the same time.\u00a0All throughout the book, he's forced to compartmentalize his feelings and be careful about what he reveals to each person in his life. He can't even completely relax with his closest friends: \"Be careful. They're not on your side. It's important to be strong.\" He tries so hard to fit in, to the point of losing himself altogether: \"Daniel was malleable, everyone and no one, a collector of moods, a careful observer of the right thing to say.\u201d The issues that Deming struggles with from having\u00a0few family connections and a complicated parent really resonated with me. One of the most heartbreaking moments was when he felt embarrassment at referring to his mother as \"Mama,\" because \"it felt like he was claiming something that didn\u2019t belong to him.\"\nEveryone had stories they told themselves to get through the days.\nI was really interested in Daniel's perspective on life, but his chapters felt uneven. He had so much going on in his life, and his musical obsession and gambling problem were a little boring for me. Peilan's chapters took the book to the next level.\u00a0Peilan has never been content to stand still and lives for the excitement of new beginnings. She writes about growing up in China, the series of events that brought her to the United States, and the struggles of starting over in a place far away from everything she'd ever known. She immigrated to the United States in hopes of a better life and financial success, but moving up the economic ladder is almost impossible between low-wage jobs, unexpected expenses, and mounting debt. Despite the new location, she finds herself encountering similar roadblocks as she did in China. She manages to build her own little family in the New York, but she feels isolated when her son speaks in rapid English that she can't understand or she hears her boyfriend exchanging family stories with his sister. She also feels suffocated by motherhood and the heavy responsibility of guiding her son in the right direction.\nDaniel preferred disorder to order, liked the trees in the spaces between buildings, leaves touching the low roofs of older homes. The city looked like it was trying to build itself up but would never fully succeed. This was an underdog\u2019s city, ambitious and messily hungry, so haphazard it could collapse one night and be reassembled by the following morning.\nWhen Deming remembers his short relationship with his mother, he remembers being \"enough\" and not having to try so hard to be accepted. Despite spending only five years together, there are many parallels to how Deming and Peilan experience the world. They find comfort in disorder, knowing \"that nothing stayed the same for too long, that each day was a new opportunity for reinvention.\" They both experience synesthesia. They imagine other versions of themselves\u00a0leading different lives. They both feel their pasts and everyone who has touched their lives as a physical weight. Getting to know Deming and Peilan as individuals\u00a0shows how\u00a0family bonds go much deeper than the biological.\n\"We can\u2019t make ourselves miserable because we think it\u2019ll make them happy. That\u2019s a screwed up way to live.\u201d\nThere's also the recurring theme of a parent's expectations conflicting with their child's needs and desires. There are both parents who see their child's successes and deficiencies as a reflection of themselves and those who don't expect anything from their children at all. In addition\u00a0to the forced assimilation, Daniel's parents dissuade him from being a musician. They want him to follow in their footsteps. Both his biological and adoptive mothers had parents who expected little of them because of their gender.\u00a0They were both were determined to shatter those low expectations, but it was still a source of resentment.\u00a0Will Daniel ever grow comfortable in his own skin and learn to live for himself?Over the years, he had thought about what his life would have been like if Mama and Leon hadn\u2019t left, if Vivian hadn\u2019t taken him to the foster care agency. It was like watching water spread across dry pavement, lines going in all directions. \u2026.\u00a0But today he could only see himself where he was right now, the particular set of circumstances that had trickled down to this particular life, that would keep trickling in new directions. ....\u00a0All this time, he\u2019d been waiting for his real life to begin: Once he was accepted by Roland\u2019s friends and the band made it big. Once he found his mother. Then, things would change. But his life had been happening all along.Did Peilan leave Deming by choice or was she taken from him by force? The Leavers is a thought-proving story about belonging, identity, and what it means to be a family. These flawed characters make awful choices and even made me angry sometimes, but I could understand how they evolved into the people they were and how they were able to rationalize their\u00a0choices. The characters fool themselves to protect a life they've grown accustomed to, but they can never completely escape what they're running from, regardless of the distance they put between themselves and their problems.The author Lisa Ko was inspired by a real-life story.

The writing got in its own way too often with too much detail and description. There were two narratives, each fluctuating between past and present that upset my reading groove.

You know those books that technically do everything right, but you still don't love them for some reason? 3 stars feels unfair to the author, who's created a beautiful story that sweeps across multiple generations and locations, but I'm in the habit of using my reviews and ratings to express my personal experience with books. I'm not trying to reach an objective truth, here, just explain why I wasn't able to love this book the way I'd thought I was going to.The Leavers tells the story of Deming Guo, whose mother, Peilan, leaves for work one day in New York City and never comes home. Deming is then adopted by a white family, the Wilkinsons, who live in rural upstate New York. The story then follows Deming, who's been rechristened Daniel, in the decade following his adoption, as he tries to assimilate to his new life while still searching for information about his birth mother. If this book had been told entirely from the point of view of Peilan, I probably would have given it 5 stars. I found her chapters riveting; from her early years growing up in a small Chinese village to working in a factory in Fuzhou to her immigration to America, I thought her story was compelling, and I could not put the book down during these segments. Unfortunately, this was a comparatively rather small part of the novel.I just could not get invested in Deming. While there was a lot that I found intriguing about his character - his insecurity about his cultural identity, never feeling American enough or Chinese enough to fit anywhere, as well as his uncertainty about his future - there was also a lot that just bored me, for lack of a better word. So much of his narrative focuses on his gambling addiction as well as his floundering career as a guitarist, and I just felt detached from a lot of it, like I was viewing the action of this story through a hazy lens and I didn't care enough to examine it more closely. I was often frustrated by Deming, who made a series of poor decisions without much thought for the consequences, and I think this frustration was partially the point, but this character just never managed to grab me in the way I had hoped for. I pitied him in an abstract kind of way, but given that this is a largely character driven novel, there just wasn't enough to sustain my interest. The parts of this novel that deal with the unique struggles of being a Chinese American adoptee - quite literally torn between two worlds - are heart-wrenching and fascinating, but I'm sorry to say that for the most part, this book just left me cold. It's very technically well made, just lacking in emotional resonance for me. Sometimes certain books just don't work for certain readers, and there isn't always a rhyme or reason to it, which I think might be the case here."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357213-sam", "userReview": "He recalled how she and Peter had insisted on English, his new name, the right education. How better and more hinged on their ideas of success, their plans. Mama, Chinese, the Bronx, Deming: they had never been enough. He shivered, and for a brief, horrible moment, he could see himself the way he realized they saw him - as someone who needed to be saved. \nLisa Ko's The Leavers is such a raw, honest read, a novel of alienation and identity, adoption and duality and what it means to be family, that is well-written with frequent notes of humor and fun, all the while treating its characters with respect while showcasing their flaws and mistakes, their struggles and redemption. The prose is intelligent, the narrative flowing, and the main characters very compelling, coalescing into an easy, enjoyable yet enlightening and thought-provoking read. I'd give it 3.5 stars and round up to 4 stars: it's definitely not perfect and sometimes feels like a first novel with some pacing and structural incongruities, but the intelligence and interesting topics, plus the overall quality of the prose won me over and I'll be looking forward to Ko's future novels as well.Our main character is Deming Guo / Daniel Wilkinson, though not far behind in importance is is mother, Peilan / Polly. We see flashes of both parts of Deming/Daniel's personality and past. As Deming, a young boy living in the Bronx with his mother, clearly struggling a bit to make ends meet on an undocumented nail technician's salary, but it's his life and he's grown to love it, with his beloved mother, her fun and caring boyfriend Leon, Leon's sister Vivian and her son Michael. And all of it comes undone the day Polly doesn't return from work, and for Deming, there's no trace of where she went or what happened to her. We're taken through his journey as he becomes Daniel, abandoned by the people who professed to love him and adopted at age eleven by a family with no children of their own, a family who believes they are prepared to love him and imprint their version of the American way upon him. And he's able to acquiesce to these well-meant wishes and desires, and submit to being Daniel Wilkinson for a time. But we all have to grow up sometime, and for Daniel, that means painful and poignant realizations and truths about himself and his adoptive family and his past.\n After ten years he had stopped noticing how different they looked from him, but he hadn't seen them in two months, had been working and riding the subway and walking the streets with all kinds of people, and now they were the ones who seemed different - quieter, diminished, out of touch. This role reversal was unexpectedly fulfilling. \nDeming / Daniel wrestles with who he is and who he should be through his childhood, adolescence, right up into the present of the novel as somewhat flailing, unconnected adult, who feels entirely alienated from the world around him, whether upstate at home with his adoptive parents increasingly disappointed in his choices and his divergence from their upbringing and values, or playing in a band and trying to socialize with his one friend from high school. He's creatively and personally stuck in neutral.\n If only he had the right clothes, knew the right references, he would finally become the person he was meant to be... but no matter how many albums he acquired or playlists he artfully compiled, the real him remained stubbornly out there like a fat cruise ship on the horizon, visible but out of reach, and whenever he got closer it drifted farther away. He was forever waiting to get past the secret entrance, and when the ropes did part he could never fully believe he was in. Another door materialized, another rope to get past, always the promise of something better. \nThese are common sentiments for those approaching and just entering adulthood, in fiction and real life, but they take extra importance for Daniel, whose past as Deming he had seemingly erased to fit into his new life, and only now does the confusion and anger and despair fully set in, as he suspects he can't be or become who he is or should be, not without processing and understanding his mother's disappearance and his abandonment by her and those he called family, and reconciling all parts of his past and personality. And while I didn't always like Daniel/Deming as a character - he could irritate and frustrate me sometimes with his self-pitying behavior - I understood and empathized with him, and wanted to see where he'd end up and if he could escape his pain and confusion and become a full adult person.If it were only from Daniel's perspective, Ko still would have written a great novel, but we also are treated to Polly / Peilan's viewpoint in first person, powerful and emotional and very relevant in today's endless political discussions about undocumented immigrants. Ko waits to provide Polly's perspective as Daniel / Deming starts to retrace her steps and put the pieces together about what happened to her (no spoilers from me), but hearing Deming's past in her voice, understanding her sharp intellect and fierce determination for a better life for her son and herself, getting a clearer glimpse of her own origins in China, and the anguish of how and why she left Deming behind creates a compelling character portrait, one I found I could empathize with as much as I did with Daniel / Deming. In short, The Leavers wears many hats at once: a coming of age story, an immigrant story, a story of reconciling diverging parts of one's past and personality, a family epic. It worked for me because of the observant, insightful description and dialogue and flowing narrative of Lisa Ko, even if there were some structural or plot decisions that I felt could have been stronger or tightened up a bit. Four stars for me, strong recommend for lovers of contemporary fiction, family and immigrant stories, and coming of age / coming into one's own tales."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Anze", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27117957-stephanie-anze", "userReview": "Deming Guo lives with his mom Polly, her boyfriend Leon, and his family in a cramped apartment in New York.

Eventually he is adopted by two white college professors, who change his name to Daniel Wilkinson and move him to the suburbs. No longer sure of his identity, he struggles to find himself.This novel deals with some hefty subject matters: illegal immigration, race, debt, identity and abandonment. Polly, whose name used to be Peilan, arrived in New York from China at 17 years old, was pregnant, alone, illegal and owning thousands of dollars to a loan shark. She struggles to make ends meet, working menial jobs that barely were enough to sustain herself, let alone pay off her debt. This gut wrenching narrative depicts the struggles of living day to day with no real sense of security. Deming is her life but she has to make some complicated decisions regarding his care. When she fails to come home, Deming's life makes a dramatic turn. He goes from being Deming Guo, a Chinese-American boy to Daniel, the adopted son of Kay and Peter Wilkinson. Though their intentions were good, they were off base thinking that Daniel only needed to become \"Americanized\" to resolve his situation. Due to the drastic change, Deming/Daniel struggles and makes mistakes, some pretty big mistakes. He simply does not know who he is, just what others want him to be. Most characters in the novel were flawed in some fundamental way and wether that was due to circumstance, personal choice or a mix of both, it made them real. Raw, poignant, honest and intense this was a great book.The narrative of this novel is somewhat based on the real life story of Xiu Ping Jiang. Originally from China, Xiu immigrated to the US fleeing a difficult past (will not go into details for that would spoil the book but I strongly encourage you to look up her story, its quite powerful). This novel is timely for immigration, particularly illegal immigration, is a hot button issue right now. The truth is that immigration is not a simple matter, its in a vast gray area and therefore not easily solved. If the only thing this book achieves is to encourage conversation and discussion, than that will be quite alot. Its not just about laws, its about people and humanity.

This tells you quite a bit about him and a running theme throughout this story of two people struggling to live the lives they were meant to live. Though on a broader scale, this is a timely and important book concerning the treatment of illegal immigrants in the US. It is also about the issue of robbing an adopted child of his cultural heritage for the misguided reason of helping him fit in better. It is also about people becoming disassociated from themselves from a loss of control over their lives and them struggling to regain their true identity, but at a cost. It is about many other things, as well, too numerous to name, things the reader should discover for himself throughout the book. This story begins with Polly Guo who when living in China became pregnant in her late teens and decided to escape to the US to avoid being forced to marry someone she didn't love and live a life she never wanted. It details her struggles when living as an illegal immigrant in the US while trying to take care of an infant as she worked long hours, and the heartbreaking decisions she was forced to make which ultimately separated her from her son, Deming. Though this book is mainly about her son, Deming Guo, renamed Daniel Wilkinson by his adoptive parents, and how Polly's decisions and misfortunes affected him for life, along with herself. Not wanting to give away spoilers, I won't say more. Just know that this is a rich story with many turns to it, some of them wrong ones, in the lives of the characters. This book would provide a wonderful in depth discussion for any book club interested in coming of age stories and humanitarian issues, as well as being appealing to individual readers looking for a literary story covering the above topics. I only wish the book had been formatted to enhance the content instead of detracting from it. This book was written in a nonlinear fashion, beginning near the middle and then bouncing back and forth in time, landing in random places in the lives of the two main characters from their differing viewpoints. This interrupted the flow of the story and sometimes became confusing, and it inevitably rehashed some scenes, adding little new information to them. Perhaps the book was written this way to build suspense concerning the disappearance of one of the characters and how each of them ended up in the lives they were living, but it felt intrusive to me. I had wished for a more straightforward story I could become totally immersed in, one that didn't give me whiplash from time traveling. But aside from those issues, it was an enriching book written simply and with fresh turns of phase that made me stop and think as the author made use of all her senses to convey life in both New York and China during that time. I didn't always like the flawed main characters for their seeming disregard toward others when seeking to fulfill themselves. But I always cared about them, and I enjoyed much of the lovely writing and the interesting ideas presented by the author through the reflections of her characters. This is a story I'll remember, one that deserved the PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction (2016)."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "One morning Deming (Daniel) Guo's Mother, Peilan (Polly) goes to work at the nail salon where she is employed and does not return.

He is a child, he does not know where his Mother is or why she never came home. His foster parents also have an adjustment to cope with. They have been married and child free for twenty years. Are they making the right decisions? Are they suited to be parents?Daniel grows up with pressure to do well academically and struggles tremendously with this goal. He also wants to pursue music and has a problem with gambling. He is a lost young man, unsure of himself in the world and with questions that have never been answered. But then there is his Mother's story. Polly was an unwed Mother at the age of nineteen. She worked hard to make a life for her and her son. She had to send her son to live with her father until she could afford to raise him. She wanted to be a good Mother but fate was not on her side. She wants to go to Florida in order to have a better life. She works hard at the nail salon and has no idea that one day her life will be changed forever. From the title it is obvious this book is about leaving. What does it mean to leave a place you call home behind? To leave those you love behind? To leave your hopes and dreams behind? What does moving on entail? There are a lot of themes in this book: immigration, family (what makes a family), hope, new beginnings, deep sadness, identity, loss, etc. This is one of those book, that stays with you after you read it. I found that I liked the book more after I sat and thought about it. There were parts I enjoyed more than others. I enjoyed learning Polly's tale more than Daniel, mainly in part because it answered some questions for me. This is a debut book which is quite impressive as it is very polished. The above mentioned themes along with the story-telling are what shine in this book. Where Polly went is not a real mystery or surprise here. I think most readers will have figured out what happened, but the magic of this book is about how it affected a young boy/man's life. How one's path in life can be changed. How does one cope when their life changes instantly? How does one cope when their name is changed? When their idea of family is changed? What happens when you are removed from one culture and placed in another? That is where the magic in this book occurs. I received a copy of this book from Algonquin Books and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Loretta", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3818887-loretta", "userReview": "Hard to summarize, so I'll just say this: I once read an article that stated that research indicated that the reason so many immigrants achieve amazing success in the United States is because there's a certain boldness of character required to move across the world to a foreign culture, and that this boldness serves you well in all circumstances. Polly Guo strikes me as a wonderful epitome of this theory.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Whispering Stories", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20354973-whispering-stories", "userReview": "Book Reviewed by Stacey on www.whisperingstories.comThe leavers by Lisa Ko is ultimately a story of love, loss and finding yourself when you feel that you don\u2019t fit in.At ten-years-old, Deming Guo has already had an eventful life. His mother Peilan (Polly) Guo was an immigrant from China to the USA, arriving whilst pregnant with Deming. Unable to support him he was sent to live with her father back in China until the age of six when his Grandfather died. He then returned to New York to live with his mum, her boyfriend Leon, Leon\u2019s sister Vivian and her son Michael.One afternoon Polly goes out to work and never returns home. Soon afterwards Leon takes off to China, leaving Deming in the care of his sister. When that becomes too much for her, she goes to the authorities where Deming is put into care and eventually adopted by white, rich couple Kay and Peter who are both professors.He is brought up as an American and even his Chinese name is changed from Deming Guo to Daniel Wilkerson. This leaves Deming/Daniel growing up with mixed emotions. He never feels that he fits in anywhere and always feels at a loss. He lost his mum and then he lost his Chinese heritage.Told from alternative viewpoints, from Peilan/Polly and Deming/Daniel, and back and forth in time. We follow Deming/Daniel as he grows up from a young boy into a man surrounded by mystery, and a hole in his heart that occurred the day his mother left. He has always wanted to know what happened to her, but growing up no-one knew. He also lost his Chinese heritage being brought up by white, rich family who wanted him to be just like other young American boys.This is a tale of one young man trying to find himself, not only on the inside but the outside too. Who is Deming/Daniel really?The book is exceptionally thought-provoking and had me interested in the lives of Peilan and Deming. I was intrigued as to where Lisa Ko was going to take her story.The plot is emotional and all the characters had lots of depth to them. I enjoyed spending time and getting to know them all. I was rooting for Deming, this young lad who had been through so much in his life, I\u2019m not surprised he was mixed up.The book is touching and so poignant. It is powerful and original too. All the little details are expertly woven together to make this a wonderful novel. It certainly made me stop and think about life."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "4.5/5 stars. This was a wonderful book, and it\u2019s hard for me to explain why I\u2019m not giving it a full 5 stars - it just didn\u2019t feel quite like a 5-star-read to me.BUT let\u2019s focus on the positive things and why I loved it so much. This is a story about immigration and identity. It\u2019s the story of American-born Deming who lives in NYC with his Chinese mother, but one day his mother goes to work and never comes back. Deming and his acquaintances wait in vain, and Deming is obviously devastated and confused, but after months of waiting he ends up with a foster family 5 hours outside of New York City. I loved how this book plays with the theme of identity, and how much knowing your roots and having them in your life affects the person you\u2019re going to grow up to be. Even though Deming is placed with a foster family, he feels a deep void inside that results in him living a disoriented life. He never feels like he chooses the right path, whatever he does, and he feels like a complete disappointment to everyone. Meanwhile, he\u2019s worried and confused and hurt because of his mother who\u2019s never found her way back to him. But this is, obviously, also a book about illegal immigrants and how they are treated in the States. I have no doubt that things have developed since the time Deming\u2019s mother disappeared, but it\u2019s questionable whether it\u2019s for the better or the worse with the concurrent president and immigrants\u2019 conditions. In other words, \u201cThe Leavers\u201d creates awareness on a topic that is very relevant and important especially today. Really good book! I know I\u2019m going to miss reading about Deming and his mother for a while now..."}, {"userName": "Book of the Month", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46126209-book-of-the-month", "userReview": "The Outsider\u2019s Guide to Not Fitting InBy Judge Elizabeth KieferThere\u2019s no better time to read a powerful book than when the world feels cold and unfriendly. While using fiction as an escape from reality is incredibly rewarding on its own, what\u2019s even better is when a novel\u2019s lessons lift from the pages and inform our lives with renewed compassion.On the surface, The Leavers is a novel about a mother and son who are separated by forces more powerful than their blood bond. Deming is a good kid growing up in the Bronx, the child of an undocumented Chinese immigrant. He is devastated when one day his mother disappears, without explanation or a trace. He will spend the next decade carrying the heartache of this abandonment.But that\u2019s only a piece of Lisa Ko\u2019s provocative story. The Leavers is also about the very concept of \"\"us\" versus \"them\"\" \u2014 about belonging, and who we are when we lose the people who make us, well, ourselves. It\u2019s about immigration and cultural barriers, the promise of the American dream and the less talked about way it can devolve into an American nightmare.Deming is adopted by well-meaning but dense parents, renamed \u201cDaniel Wilkinson\u201d and moved from his neighborhood to a white suburb upstate, where he stands out as a minority and struggles to fit in. He\u2019ll later return to his roots on the Lower East Side of Manhattan (right near Chinatown) as an angry young man seeking to reconnect with his core identity.Which brings us to a third theme of the novel: a complex portrait of a woman thrust into motherhood when she isn\u2019t yet ready. Polly adores her son, yet resents the burden he places on her existence. She cannot imagine living without him\u2014until she has no other choice. So rarely are we allowed to focus on female ambivalence about motherhood. In this incredible novel, we get that\u2014and so very, very much more.I read this book over the course of a single weekend, so don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you: Once you pick it up and get through a chapter, you\u2019re probably in it for the long haul. But I can\u2019t think of a better way to wile away the hours at the moment, so here is my recommendation: Turn off the news. Forget about Twitter for a couple days. Steep yourself in a story that\u2019s different from your own. I promise, you\u2019ll learn something. I certainly did \u2014 and what\u2019s more, is that reading The Leavers reminded me of how much listening to narratives of others, both for pleasure and for understanding, I still need to do.Read more at https://www.bookofthemonth.com/the-le..."}, {"userName": "Furrawn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5437232-furrawn", "userReview": "My friend Adlah told me to read this book.
