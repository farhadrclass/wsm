I have a friend who is mad at me right now for liking stupid stuff, but the thing is that I do like stupid stuff sometimes, and I think it would be really boring to only like smart things. What I don\u2019t like is when smart (or even middle-brained) writers take an important topic and make it petty through guessing about what they don\u2019t know. I can list you any number of these writers who would be fine if they weren't reaching into topics about which they have no personal experience (incidentally, all writers I'm pretty sure my angry friend loves. For example, The Lovely Bones, The Kite Runner, Water for Elephants, Memoirs of a Geisha, etc.). These are the books for which I have no patience, topics that maybe someone with more imagination or self-awareness could have written about compassionately, without exploiting the victimization of the characters. They\u2019re books that hide lazy writing behind a topic you can\u2019t criticize. The Help is one of these.You\u2019ve got this narrative telephone game in this book. The telephone game is pretty fun sometimes, and it is really beautiful in monster stories like Frankenstein and Wuthering Heights because what they are telling me is not intended as trustworthy or earnest. All of the seriousness in monster stories is an impression or an emotion reflected back through the layers of narrative. I don\u2019t feel that way about the topic of The Help, though. In this book, a white woman writes from the point of view of a black woman during the Civil Rights movement, who overhears the conversations of white women. It's an important topic, and I don't want to hear it through untrustworthy narrators.So, I can basically get on board with the dialect of the black maids, but what throws me off as a reader is when the black maid is quoting the white women and they\u2019re all speaking perfect English without a trace of an accent. It becomes particularly weird when one of the black maids starts to comment on the extreme accent of one of the white women, Celia Foote, whose written dialogue continues to be impeccable. Who is this narrator? Why does she choose not to speak proper English if she can speak it? Why does she choose to give proper English to someone else who she has told me doesn't speak it? Also, usually the layers of narration in a telephone-game book are only within the book. In this case, it\u2019s the author\u2019s voice stabbing through the story. I am convinced it is her whose brain hears the white woman speaking TV English, and the black women speaking in dialect. It gives away the game. Even the quotes from the movie have an example of this. A conversation between her and Minnie goes like this:Celia Foote: They don't like me because of what they think I did.Minny Jackson: They don't like you 'cause they think you white trash. Celia speaks in a proper sentence, but Minny misses the \"are\" in the second part of the sentence. Celia says \"because,\" but Minny says \"'cause.\" If the reader were supposed to understand that Celia does not speak in dialect, that would make sense, but since it specifically states that she does, it doesn't make sense.To attempt to be clear, I didn't have a problem that the book was in dialect. I had a problem that the book said, \"This white woman speaks in an extreme dialect,\" and then wrote the woman's dialog not in dialect. Aerin points out in message 111 that I am talking about eye dialect, which is about spelling, not pronunciation, as in the example above. Everyone, in real life, speaks in some form of non-standard English. Though I have seen some really beautiful uses of eye dialect, as Aerin points out, writers typically use it to show subservience of characters or that they are uneducated, which often has racist overtones. If it troubles you that I'm saying this, and you would like to comment on this thread, you may want to read other comments because it is likely someone has already said what you are going to say.I\u2019m not finishing this one, and it\u2019s not because I think people shouldn\u2019t like it, but rather because I\u2019m almost 100 pages in and I can see the end, and it\u2019s failed to engage me. When a few IRL friends have asked what I thought of the book and I said I didn't care for it, they have told me that I am taking it too seriously, that it is just a silly, fluff book, not a serious study of Civil Rights. Again, I don\u2019t have a problem with stupid books, but when it\u2019s a stupid book disguised as an Important Work of Cultural History, all I want to do the whole time is tear its mask off. And a book about Civil Rights is always important cultural history to me. Anyway, the book becomes unpleasant; I become unpleasant; it\u2019s bad news. If you loved this book, though, (or, really, even if you hated it) I would recommend Coming of Age in Mississippi. I think that book is one of the more important records of American history. Plus, it\u2019s beautifully written, inspirational, and shocking. It's been years since I read it, so I might be giving it an undeserved halo, but I can\u2019t say enough good things about it.INDEX OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS REVIEW\"You should finish the book before you talk about it\": comment 150 (second paragraph); comments 198 and 199. \u201cStockett did experience the Civil Rights Era\u201d: comment 154; comment 343.\u201cThe author of The Lovely Bones was raped\u201d: comment 190.\u201cThe author of The Kite Runner is from Afghanistan\u201d: comment 560.\"Memoirs of a Geisha is accurate and not comparable to The Help\": comment 574.\u201cDon\u2019t be so critical!\u201d: comment 475.\u201cHave you written a bestseller?\u201d: comment 515.\u201cFiction doesn\u2019t have to be a history lesson\u201d: comments 157 through 162.\u201cHaving grown up in the South during this era and having had a maid, I could relate to the emotional nuances of this book\u201d: comments 222 and 223.\"Minny and Aibileen are relatable\": comment 626\u201cYou are trying to silence authors\u201d: comment 317 and comments 306 through 316.\u201cWhy do you want to read a Civil Rights book about racism and hatred?

I understand that the author wrote much of this as a result of her experiences growing up in the south in the 1960's, and that it may seem authentic to her, and that she was even trying to be respectful of the people and the time; but, ultimately, I thought that it was written from a very narrow, idealized, almost childish perspective of race relations without a true appreciation of the humanity and soul of the characters. And the ultimate theme & message (i.e. \"why, we're all the same - there's no difference between us after all!\") only reinforced my feeling that this is written from someone who has a very undeveloped or underdeveloped concept of race and race relations in the United States. The author would benefit from exploring authentic African American voices (Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou) and understanding the scope, range and (most important) the foundation of the emotions genuine African American characters express as a result of their journey as a people in the US (hope, frustration, drive, passion, anger, happiness, sadness, depression, joy)."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/406752-joe", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Annalisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa", "userReview": "Here is an illustrative tale of what it was like to be a black maid during the civil rights movement of the 1960s in racially conflicted Mississippi. There is such deep history in the black/white relationship and this story beautifully shows the complex spectrum, not only the hate, abuse, mistrust, but the love, attachment, dependence. Stockett includes this quote by Howell Raines in her personal except at the end of the novel: There is no trickier subject for a writer from the South than that of affection between a black person and a white one in the unequal world of segregation. For the dishonesty upon which a society is founded makes every emotion suspect, makes it impossible to know whether what flowed between two people was honest feeling or pity or pragmatism. An eloquent way to describe Stockett's intentions for this novel. I know most reviews will probably focus on the racial relationships in the book, but to me the most haunting statement was that when you are paying someone to care for you and their livelihood depends on making you happy, you can't expect an honest relationship. I did not expect this book to hit so close to home. After all, I did not grow up in the South and completely missed the racial mind shift in the country. But the book isn't just about racism and civil rights. It's about the employer relationship too. And I did grow up in South America with a maid trying to keep herself out of poverty by making our crazy family happy. As much as we loved her, I can see so many of the pitfalls from these complex relationships in my own history. I know our maid was stuck between pleasing my mother and raising us the way she believed appropriate. I know it was physically hard to work from sunup to late everyday and emotionally hard to never relax because she wasn't the decision maker of our home and at any moment she could be reprimanded for making the wrong decision. She had absolutely no power, and yet she was all powerful to shape and mold us. I needed her, felt bad for how much I imposed upon her, but I never voiced how much I appreciated or loved her. I took her for granted. Even though she was paid to love us, I know she did. We were her children, especially my youngest brothers. And yet when she moved back home, we lost contact. Was it out of laziness of our own narcissistic lives or was the complexity of our relationship so draining she cut the tie? It is my fear that she thinks we did not return her affection and only thought of her as the maid. I often think about her, we all reminisce about her wondering where she is, and more than anything, I just want to know that she is happy and tell her thank you. It is so strange that someone who is such a vital part of your childhood can just vanish out of your life. \"They say its like true love, good help. You only get one in a lifetime.\" I know. Believe me, I know.The story is strong and real and touched something deep inside me. I could so relate to the motherly love from Constantine to Skeeter, see that pain in the triangle between Aibileen and Mae Mobley and Elizabeth, feel the exasperation of Minny toward Celia, and understand the complexity of the good and bad, the love and hate, the fear and security. Stockett captured all these emotions.I also loved the writing style. When style compliments plot, I get giddy. I don't always love grammatically incorrect prose or books about an author trying to be published, but here it works because it's honest. The novel is about a white woman secretly compiling true accounts of black maids--and the novel is in essence a white author trying to understand black maids. The styles parallel each other as do the messages. The point of Skeeter's novel is to make people see that people are just people no matter the color of their skin and Stockett's novel beautifully portrays that with both good and bad on both sides. The fictional novel cover is decorated with the white dove of love and understanding. To get us there, Stockett gives us three ordinary birds, a picture of ordinary life asking to be accepted for its honest simplicity. This book is Stockett's masterpiece, that story in her that was just itching to get out. From the first page, the voice of the characters took vivid form and became real, breathing people. I loved Aibileen, but think I loved Minny's voice more because she is such a strong character. Besides the maids, I loved Hilly as a portrayal of the white Southern belle with the ingrained belief that black people are not as good as whites, verbalized as \"separate but equal\" so it doesn't sound racist. My favorite scene was when Hilly says they have to be careful of racists because they are out there. She's a bit over the top, but if you've been to the South, not that far of a stretch. I just would have liked to find some redeeming qualities in her from Skeeter's perspective. While there are some instances where I felt Stockett was squeezing historical facts into the novel, forming the plot around these events instead of letting them play backdrop, and occasionally I could read the modern woman in this tale pushing her message too hard, Stockett's sincerity to understand and appreciate shines through. She lived this book to some extent and the story is a part of her. Because it's important to her it becomes important to me."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2927182-ellen", "userReview": "The Kindle DX I ordered is galloping to the rescue today... AND, for all the book purists (which would include me), this is a need, rather than a want. Post-several eye surgeries, I'm just plain sick of struggling to read the words on a page.However, despite the visual challenges, I read all 451 pages of The Help yesterday. Clearly, the book held my interest. However, I spent last night pondering why the book wasn't as good as my nonstop reading would indicate.What was wrong? Most of all, I think it was the book's ambivalent tone. In brief, a white woman, Miss Skeeter Phelan--one of Jackson, Mississippi's socially elite--convinces a number of the African-American maids to tell her their story. What goes on in the homes of the upper crust? How do these women really treat their maids? Though the book would be published anonymously and no locations would be given, the stories provide enough detail so that the premise (that the book could be received as being about Anywhere, USA) defies belief. Further, while having the book's source known might subject Skeeter to social ostracism, this is the 1960s in Missa-fuckin-sippi in the middle of the very tense civil rights' battles. For the maids, discovery would mean loss of a job (with no hope of getting another position) and retribution that could include being falsely accused of a crime (and jailed) or even being injured or killed.Despite the underlying tension and references to violent events that do occur, the book teeters. At times, I was furious and in tears over the effing racism and the tragedies described. But Kathryn Stockett keeps pulling back. It's as though she wants it both ways. Let's divulge the incredible cruelty and violence that black people routinely endured, but let's also show the goodness of some white people and soft-pedal the whole thing into a broader theme, i.e., how difficult it is for two women in any unequal power situation to be \"friends.\"Nope. Sorry. You can't have it both ways. Though some of the women are kinder to their maids, they did not fight against the \"separate but equal\" indignities that included building a \"nigra\" toilet in their home or garage so that the maids' \"nasty\" germs would not infect them, the separate entrances, the substandard schools, the \"justice\" system that made a white accusation the same as proof, and on and on and on.I don't want a book to make me cry and then pull back and say, \"It's all right.\" It's not all right. If you're going to write a book about this horrible time in our history - and in a country where racism is still alive and well - then do it all out. What these women endured deserves more. Don't put it out there and then pull back and use a Doris Day lens. It doesn't work."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "\u201cEver morning, until you dead in the ground, you gone have to make this decision.

They read like nonfiction, and nonfiction is only good for me if I\u2019m in need of sleep. B-but\u2026The Help is different. It doesn\u2019t only describe the life of housemaids, in the second half of the 20th century, in Mississippi; it\u2019s overflowing with raw emotion. It doesn\u2019t put every white person in a box and every black person in another\u2026 It underlines the difference of thought between people, but also how similar we actually all are. We all want to live our lives the best way possible and be treated with respect.\u201cYou is kind. You is smart. You is important.\u201dI really felt it, when Aibileen and Minny talked about their work, how they wanted \u2013 needed \u2013 things to change and how hard their lives were. It made me sad, of course, because they just didn\u2019t deserve the animosity that was directed toward them and that\u2019s why I was so eager to turn the pages: I couldn\u2019t wait to see some things change over there.Miss Skeeter is also an important part of this story. She\u2019s not loud, she doesn\u2019t look for trouble, but she does have a weapon no one expects her to use in her advantage: her writing. She faces obstacles, so many of them, but does she ever back down? No, because when she believes in something, no one can kill her spirit.I can\u2019t believe the author never made Skeeter and Celia interact: they would have connected from the start! And was Stuart\u2019s character\u2019s purpose only to make us see how differences in ways of thinking can drift people apart? He is the most frustrating part of the story, really. We hate him, we love him, we like him and then we hate him for the rest of the book.Never fear, the underlying themes of the story are extraordinary and that alone should make everyone want to read this book. Equality. Freedom. Racism. Respect. They\u2019re all so fascinating because they are cleverly developed and included and intertwined in a way that makes this story such a precious and worth perusing one.I would also like to take advantage of this space offered to me and recommend the movie.

It more or less rubbed me the wrong way. It reads like the musings of a white woman attempting to have an uncomfortable conversation, without really wanting to be uncomfortable. It's incredibly hard to write with integrity about race and be completely honest and vulnerable. The author failed to make me believe she was doing anything beyond a show & tell. And if her intent isn't anything greater, then it makes this book all the more pandering to the white imagination of what it must have been like to be \"the help\" during that era. It's passive self-reflection at best and utterly useless.The national fascination with this book makes me sick. It makes me think of my grandmother who was \"the help\" to many white families for well over 50 years. Her stories aren't too different from those told in this book, but they are hers to tell. If she were alive today, I don't believe she would praise Stockett's book. In fact, I think she we would be horrified at the thought that her years of hard work (in some cases, for some very horrible people) would be reduced to some wannabe feel good story of the past."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "enthusiasm!!! this book and i almost never met. and that would have been tragic. the fault is mostly mine - i mean, the book made no secret of its existence - a billion weeks on the best seller list, every third customer asking for it at work, displays and reviews and people on here praising it to the heavens. it practically spread its legs for me, but i just kept walking. i figured it was something for the ladies, like sex and the city, which i don't have to have ever seen an episode of to know that it's not something i would enjoy. i figured that this book was on the ladder one rung above chick lit. so i am to blame for my snobbish dismissiveness, but have you seen this cover?? what is with that sickroom color scheme? and i hate those stupid little birds. what is chip kidd so busy doing that he can't just pop over here and lend a hand?? it is not my fault for thinking it was a crappy book when that cover wanted me to think it is a crappy book.but this book is good. really, really good. again, i thank you, readers' advisory class, for fixing me up with this book. it has been a long time since i have read such a frankly entertaining book. (if a book about the emotionally-charged early days of the civil rights movement can be called entertaining.) this is just an effortlessly told story, split between three different women, whose voices and perspectives never run together - the secondary characters are also completely believable and are all different brands of repellent, with some token sympathetic characters tossed in for the halibut. i don't even know what to say, i just feel all \"aw, shucks, i loved this book\" about it - there were several times i would catch myself grinning at a turn of phrase or a situation, and every time i would start to doubt myself, that maybe i would like sex and the city. or buffy the vampire slayer  or all these things i have formerly judged without having read/seen/eaten. maybe i am like these white women in the book, taking their help for granted and assuming they have nothing to say to each other because of their unwillingness to talk to them and know them as human beings. maybe buffy and i have so much to learn from one another...then i would snap out of it and remember that my gut opinions are 99.99% foolproof. so for you other people, who need to be swayed by hype - i give you hype. this book's hype is merited - it would be a perfect book to read this summer when you are melting from the sun and need a good story.. this is a very tender and loving book, about hope and sisterhood and opportunity, but also about beatings and terror and shame.still hate those birds, though."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "\u201cWe are just two people.

It\u2019s not very often I get to discuss books with people in real life and I wasn\u2019t going to let this opportunity slip by. Audio books are good for me. I was so engrossed in the story and characters that I drove the speed limit on the highway and took the scenic route while running errands.

Twenty-two year-old Eugenia \u201cSkeeter\u201d Phelan has returned home after graduating college to find that Constantine, her family\u2019s maid and the woman who raised her, has mysteriously disappeared. Aibileen is a black maid in her 50\u2019s who works for the Leefolt family and cares deeply for their daughter, Mae Mobley. She is still grieving for her young son, who died in a workplace accident.

I should share my views so others can decide if it's a good book for them.That said... did anyone not love or like this book? I'll have to check out some other people's reviews... And I wonder how many people just watched the movie... Oh well... I'll keep this review short and not in my usual format, as probably everyone I'm friends with on here has already read it! :)The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because I felt like some of the stories needed a better or stronger ending.

Scary thoughts, but in the end, at least the right people got something back they deserved, even if it wasn't as much as it should have been.The characters are very clear and strong. And when there are upwards of 10 to 12 supporting or lead female characters, an author has to spend a tremendous amount of time creating distinct pictures in a readers mind. Stockett did a great job with this task. Each and every one shows you a different personality: leaders and followers, movers and shakers, smart and silly, strong and weak, tolerant and intolerant, thirsty for all the world has to offer and content to stay the same for an entire lifetime.When a writer can shuffle this many people throughout a story, they have invested themselves into the book, the characters, the setting, the theme, the future.I haven't read anything else by this author, but just thinking about this book, and realizing I haven't looked at her other works makes me want to run to her profile now and pick one.

In addition, Skeeter keeps telling us that Hilly and Elizabeth are her friends but that's just it--she tells us. We never see why she would want to be friends with either of them, Hilly especially. Other characters were equally unbelievable. All the maids are good people and so gracious to Miss Skeeter, save one. Reading their interactions with Skeeter, I was reminded of Chris Rock's bit about old black men: \"I know some of you white people know an old black man--'Oh, Willy at the job--he's so nice!' Willy hates your guts.\" Worst of all is the particular characterization of Aibileen. I was going to say that it borders on portraying her as a Magical Black Person because I didn't think she had magical powers, but then I remembered the part about how her fellow church members think her prayers are more powerful than others'. The premise: Before reading, my question was, can Kathryn Stockett write this story? I read the whole book. I read the self-conscious afterword. Can Stockett write this story? Well, of course she can. But should she? I lean toward no. This is not her story to tell. I was reminded of Lo's Diary and how Pia Pera said that she thought of a part in Lolita as an invitation to a a literary tennis match and so she had to write it and no, you didn't. And neither did Kathryn Stockett. She said that she wrote this book because it'd never occurred to her what her maid Demetrie's life was like. So she made up the story. And it was still all about the white lady."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "Kathryn Stockett has created this wonderful story that depicts life in America\u2019s South during the early 1960s. A mix of humour and social justice, the reader is faced with a powerful piece on which to ponder while remaining highly entertained. In Jackson, Mississippi, the years leading up to the Civil Rights Movement presented a time where colour was a strong dividing line between classes. Black women spent much of their time serving as hired help and raising young white children, while their mommas were playing \u2018Society Lady\u2019 as best they could. Eugenia \u201cSkeeter\u201d Phelan may have been part of the clique, born with a silver spoon in her mouth, but she held herself on the periphery, at times looking in. Skeeter was unwed and with few prospects, though her time away at college left her ready to tackle the workforce until an eligible man swept her off her feet. Skeeter returned to Jackson, only to find her family\u2019s help left under mysterious circumstances and no one was willing to discuss it. Skeeter sought a job as a writer, prepared to begin at the bottom rung, but not giving up on sleuthing around to determine what might have been going on in Jackson. Skeeter scored a job writing an informative column in the local newspaper, giving cleaning tips to housewives in need of a little guidance. Who better to offer these tips that the hired help of Jackson?! Skeeter fostered a slow friendship with one, while building up a trust, and has an idea for a book that could offer a unique perspective in Mississippi\u2019s divided society. Skeeter sought to write a tell-all from the perspective of the hired help, in hopes of shining a light on the ongoing domestic slavery taking place within a \u2018freed\u2019 America. With secret meetings taking place after working hours and Skeeter typing away, a mental shift took place and the idea of class became taboo, at least to some. Full of confessions and struggles in Mississippi society, Skeeter\u2019s book may just tear the fabric of what has been a clearly demarcated community since after the Civil War. However, sometimes a book has unforeseen consequences, turning the tables on everyone and forcing tough decisions to be made. Stockett pulls no punches in the presentation, fanning the flames of racial and class divisions, as she depicts a way of thinking that was not only accepted, but completely sanctioned. A must-read for anyone ready to face some of the treatment undertaken in the name of \u2018societal norms\u2019, Stockett tells it like it was\u2026 and perhaps even still is!Race relations in the United States has long been an issue written about, both in literature and pieces of non-fiction. How a country as prosperous as America could still sanction the mistreatment of a large portion of its citizens a century after fighting a war on the issue remains completely baffling. While Stockett focusses her attention on Mississippi, the conscious reader will understand that this sort of treatment was far from isolated to the state. One might venture to say that racism continued on a worldwide scale, creating a stir, while many played the role of ostriches and denied anything was going on. The characters within the book presented a wonderful mix of society dames and household help, each with their own issues that were extremely important. The characters bring stereotypes to life in an effort to fuel a raging fire while offering dichotomous perspectives. The interactions between the various characters worked perfectly, depicting each group as isolated and yet fully integrated. The household help bring the struggle of the double work day (triple, at times) while the society dames grasp to keep Mississippi from turning too quickly towards integration and equality, which they feel will be the end of all normalcy. Using various narrative perspectives, the characters become multi-dimensional. Additionally, peppering the dialogue with colloquial phraseology pulls the story to a new level of reality, one that is lost in strict textbook presentation. Stockett pushes the narrative into those uncomfortable places the reader hopes to keep locked in the pages of history, pushing the story to the forefront and requiring a synthesising of ideas and emotions. This discomfort is the only way the reader will see where things were, likely in a hope not to repeat some of history\u2019s worst moments in America\u2019s development. However, even fifty years after the book\u2019s setting, there remains a pall of colour and class division promulgating on city streets. While racism is not as sanctioned in as many laws, it remains a strong odour and one that cannot simply be washed away by speaking a few words. This book, as entertaining as it is in sections, is far from fictional in its depiction of the world. The sooner the reader comes to see that, the faster change can occur. All lives matter, if we put in the effort and have the presence of mind to listen rather than rule from our own ivory towers.Kudos, Madam Stockett for this wonderful piece. I am happy to have completed a buddy read on this subject and return to read what was a wonderful cinematic presentation.Like/hate the review?

At least that's what I told my friend. I remember thinking something along the lines of, blah, another story about racism in the old southern days? Must be the chick-lit version of To Kill a Mockingbird. Wow. I was so wrong.The Help details the lives of three women living in Jackson, Mississippi, right when the Civil Rights Movement began. There is Skeeter, a twenty-two-year-old aspiring writer who terribly misses her maid, Constantine. Aibileen is an experienced and knowledgeable black maid who is currently taking care of her seventeenth child, Mae Mobley, even though she realizes what's at stake for both of them. And Minny is a fierce, sassy cook who doesn't take nonsense from anyone, even when it risks her employment. This tumultuous trio takes the first step in sparking a movement that will ignite fire to the racism and hypocrisy of their small town.My synopsis of the story probably isn't even a tenth of the merit it deserves. I don't want to spoil too much about the book, but the most amazing thing about The Help is its characters. They are so real, so lifelike, I could feel their thoughts pulsing through my head and their emotions racing through my veins. I was angry alongside them, cheered for them, and cried with them.I think everyone should read this book, especially people who are ignorant about the racism and hypocrisy that still manages to plight everyday society.

It is set in segregated Jackson, Mississippi, in 1962-64, at the dawn of the civil rights movement, but it's local and domestic, rather than looking at the big picture.The first third of the book establishes the main characters and their situation and relationships; the rest of it revolves around a dangerous plan to write about their lives: it ends up reading as if it's a book about how this book was created (though the notes at the end make it clear that it isn't). It is a novel about individuals, and makes no pretence of being a history of the civil rights movement, but given the subject matter, it arouses strong feelings (see below, including comments, for some of the reasons). Passions run high in those with direct experience or detailed knowledge of racial issues in the US. My comments are the reaction of a fairly ignorant outsider.For a deeper, more complex, and educational (for me) way of looking at the legacy of slavery on race relations, see Octavia Butler's Kindred, review here.IT'S ABOUT MOTHERING AND AWAKENING AS MUCH AS RACEAlthough it might appear that the main relationships are between employer and help, mothering and displaced mothering is in many ways a stronger theme. It's also about other relationships, especially between women: bitchy cliques, friendships made and broken, fear versus collusion. Husbands don't generally come out of it well.There is an awkward pact involved for white mothers: letting your children be raised by members of a race you despise versus raising the children of your oppressors. As Skeeter says, \"They raise a white child and then 20 years later the child becomes the employer. It's that irony that we love them and they love us, yet we don't even allow them to use the toilet in the house\". There are opportunities to sway young minds (and Aibileen tries especially hard), whilst thinking, \"Baby Girl, who I know, deep down, I can't keep from turning out like her mama\". The maids' jobs and colour also have a negative effect on their own mothering. Not only do some of the white children feel the help loves them more than their own mothers; in some cases they are right, and that causes other tensions and problems. Yet firing the help is not always an option: \"the help always know\" all the secrets.The three main characters are very strong women, and each gradually finds the strength to follow her conscience, despite the personal risks, to the point where Skeeter realises \"I no longer feel protected because I am white\". They learn, grow, awaken, and take some control over the future. However, if I were an African-American, or raised in the deep south, I'm sure these aspects would seem much less significant in comparison to the race theme.AUTHENTICITY?When I read this, I had no idea how accurate any of it is (I have subsequently learned of many doubts), but in terms of individual relationships, it rings true to this Brit, especially the different voices through which the story is told. It was also interesting that the maids were so used to \"the lines\", that they disliked it when they were crossed, e.g. by an employer who was too friendly: \"She just don't see 'em. The Lines. Not between her and me, not between her and Hilly\". Yet the maids train their own children into subjugation by teaching the rules \"for working for a white lady\". This has strange effects: \"I don't know what to say to her. All I know is, I ain't saying it. And I know she ain't saying what she want a say either and it's a strange thing happening here cause nobody saying nothing and we still managing to have us a conversation\".On the other hand, it seems improbable that all the powerful white women in the town are only in their mid 20s. I presume that was necessary because they needed to be contemporaries of Skeeter, and she needed to be young, but it still made me question the story in broader terms.SYMPATHIESOne expects to have strong sympathies for the maids, but a couple of the white women (including Skeeter) have a hard time (not as hard as the maids, though): material privilege, but they don't fit into either world. That creates a tension in the reader that is quite powerful.The saddest white person is the little girl Aibileen cares for; she is a misfit in her own home, because her mother never bonded with her, \"She like one a them baby chickens that get confused and follow the ducks around instead\". Aibileen tries hard to compensate, particularly by repeating the mantra \"You kind, you smart, you important\". Mind you, she also sows the seeds future disagreement with her parents by telling secret stories about a kind alien visitor called Martian Luther King who thinks all people are the same, and by wrapping identical sweets in different coloured wrappers to make the same point. \"I want to stop that moment from coming - and it comes in ever white child's life - when they start to think that coloured folks ain't as good as whites.\"STEREOTYPESAlthough the book fits with some stereotypes (e.g. the hideous contradiction of raising money for starving Africans whilst campaigning for outside loos in all white homes, lest the owners catch black diseases), it certainly confounds others, both in the minds of some of the characters and, to a lesser extent, to the readers (e.g. many of the maids are more educated than might be expected and Aibileen is an keen and excellent writer). As Skeeter says, \"The dichotomy of love and disdain living side by side is what surprises me\", and that was the core of the book for me.LANGUAGE, DIALECT and DIFFERENT VOICESFrom the very first sentence, you are aware of Aibileen's voice and dialect, \"on a early Sunday\". She is an ageing maid who cares for white children when they are young, then moves on. Her own son died in an industrial accident at 24 and from then \"A bitter seed was planted inside me. And I just didn't feel so accepting any more\". Is this dialect accurate, patronising appropriation, or both?Minny is the other black voice: a maid and church friend of Aibileen's, but with a young family and violent husband. She speaks her mind, so has often been fired.The final voice is Skeeter, the daughter of a plantation owner who has returned from college and is shocked to discover that the beloved maid who raised her has gone, and no one will tell her why.OTHER IRRITATIONS* My knowledge of US history is scanty and I didn't know when it was set until page 22, though even then I was only able to work it out by looking up Stevie Wonder's year of birth.* Despite being initially vague about the date, some subsequent mentions of period detail seem rather forced, e.g. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", Rosa Parks and Bob Dylan. It should have been possible to mention them in a more natural way.* Did anyone say they needed \"space\" and \"time\" away from a relationship in Mississippi in 1963?"}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "The Help is a tale of lines, color, gender and class, in the Jackson, Mississippi of the early 1960s. This is a world in which black women work as domestics in white households and must endure the whims of their employers lest they find themselves jobless, or worse. It is the Jackson, Mississippi where Medgar Evers is murdered, and where spirit and hope are crushed daily. It is the Jackson, Mississippi where Freedom Riders are taken from a bus, a place where segregation and racism are core beliefs and where challenge to the status quo is met with resistance, to the point of violence. It is a time of political turmoil on the national stage, as the civil rights movement is picking up steam. It is also a place where using the wrong bathroom could get a black person beaten to death.  The Help sees this world through three sets of eyes, Aibeleen, a fifty-something black woman who has taken care of many white children and is beginning again with a newborn. Minny, in her thirties, has troubles enough at home, with an abusive, drunken husband and several children of her own, but her inability to control her tongue has led to a series of jobs and a series of firings. Skeeter is a young white woman, newly graduated from college, and eager to pursue a career in writing. Skeeter has grown a conscience and no longer accepts the presumptions of the past. She yearns to know what happened to Constantine, the black woman who was so important to her as a child. Skeeter sees the unfairness of the social structure. She engages Aibeleen, Minny and a host of other black domestic workers to tell their stories for a book, hoping to expose the hypocrisy and cruelty of Jackson\u2019s white society. The story not only places the events in historical context, but offers a taste of what it must have been like for the Aibeleens, Minnys and Skeeters of the time. Stockett has created living, breathing characters, people you can relate to, cheer and cry for. If there is softness here, it is that the devils are painted in glaring red, which may be an accurate portrayal of the time, but makes for a melodramatic feel at times. The heroines are fully realized. We get a sense of how they came to be the way they are. While we are offered some background on the baddies, it is not enough to make them as completely human as the three narrators. The Help is a powerful, moving read, blessed with a colorful, believable cast of characters, a compelling setting and an eternal message of shared humanity, a knockout of a first novel."}, {"userName": "Praveen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19760612-praveen", "userReview": "I done finished this book finally !I ain't never seen a book like this lately.it were not too long before I seen something in me had changed, reading it !

I cannot gush enough about this book.The Help, by Kathryn Stockett, follows the lives of three women living in 1962 Jackson, Mississippi. Two of the women, Aibilene and Minny are black, hired as help to wealthy, or trying to appear wealthy, white families. Eugenia, or \"Skeeter\" as she is called, is a white woman recently graduated from Ole Miss University and trying to become a writer. She is what probably most of us are, kindly ignorant of the world around her. Raised on what her mother embarrassingly still refers to as a \"plantation\" she lived in an environment with all the privilege and prejudice you'd expect from a southern belle. Living at home again, Skeeter doesn't quite fit in anymore among her friends, who are all married with children.When a feminist editor from New York rejects one of Skeeter's submissions, she includes with that rejection the advice for Skeeter to write about what disturbs her. It is while playing bridge with her friends, and she becomes aware of her friend, Miss Hilly's, crusade for every home to have a separate bathroom installed for \"the help\", to contain the germs blacks carry that whites are more susceptible to, that Skeeter realizes she has found her subject matter.Skeeter is the least developed character of the three but she is the means in which this uniquely uplifting story can be told. Without Skeeter, who at 22, finally and lonesomely comes of age, The Help would simply be another shocking look at the racial inequality that existed still so recently in the South. It is Skeeter's character, and her ambition to write a book that matters, that strips Aibilene's and Minny's blatantly mistreated, funny and irresistible characters out of their perfectly pressed maid uniforms and into each of our lives.I don't want to give away too much about Abilene and Minny, who became women I loved. They mattered to me. Aibilene, especially, is so vividly written, that her voice, her mannerisms... her unguarded moments... took solid form in my imagination. More than anything, I wanted her to thrive. To triumph.As rich as this book is in both characterization and plot, its real accomplishment is that it encouraged me to examine my own prejudices. Racism has always been a frustrating topic for me to think about, as has sexism. My mind has a hard time wrapping around the idea that there was a time when educated people - enlightened people - sincerely believed that any race or gender was superior to another. It seems our spirits must have always had the capacity for understanding that this could not be so, but The Help showed me how such beliefs are possible.Stockett, a southern white woman herself, exposes this possibility with an experienced sympathy. Using a variety of characters, she demonstrates how many Southerners in this particular chapter of our nation's history weren't racist because they were mean-spirited or elitists, but because tradition and bogus science had supported their belief. Foolish traditions, yes, but they were able to be easily convinced that a separate toilet was not only desirable but necessary because they lacked scientific understanding about germs and contamination and genetics. They only thing available to counter such painfully offensive actions was personal reflection and, perhaps, their consciences. More so, and what was really eye opening to me, were the attitudes of \"the help\", and how their own actions and attitudes were also heavily influenced by tradition and fear - as much so as their white counterparts. Whites, with control and power, dosed out injustice after injustice that was defended by their fear and blacks adjusted to the degradation based on their own learning and fear. Minny was taught by her mother how to behave as a maid in the home of a white woman - what to say and do and how to say and do it. She also experienced first hand the consequences of breaking with that tradition, being fired and blacklisted and unable to provide for her family. The difference between what excuses the fear as loathsome or imaginable was the availability of recourse. Blacks had none. Or very little.I must believe, as a human being, that there is something inside each of us that witnesses the value of our souls. However, blacks, then, had even less access to understanding and knowledge than their white peers which left them with little other than their own consciences as proof of their worth. How frustrating to be human whose freedom is limited by the understanding of others. It made me wonder which of us are like Miss Skeeter, Miss Hilly, Aibilene or Minny. Are we currently kindly ignorant, arrogantly holding all the answers, quietly giving the best of ourselves with what society allows or protecting our vulnerability with a tough outer shell?Perhaps, we are all of them, at different times of our lives, progressing at our individual rates of enlightenment and courage. As Skeeter explained, \"Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, 'We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought'.\"Amen.Now, go read this book!"}, {"userName": "Maggie Stiefvater", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246837-maggie-stiefvater", "userReview": "So, it looks like THE HELP is turning out to be one of those novels that I love despite flaws.

It was engrossing, very well characterized and often funny. Strangely enough, two of those are also part of what I consider its flaws. The characters are so reliably themselves that they are nearly caricatures in some areas. While it meant I could definitely never mistake one woman\u2019s voice for another, it also gave it a bit of a Hollywood/ sitcom feel; they were types instead of people. And the funny -- well, race relations in \u201860s Mississippi is not exactly all fun and mint juleps, as everyone knows. But this book is upbeat, uplifting, and ultimately made a bit fluffy by all its humor and optimism. Again, I could imagine this as a Hollywood screenplay in a New York minute.

What I care about is, if in ten years, a white lady will call my girls dirty and accuse them of stealing the silver.\"\nI watched the movie based on this book a few years ago so when I saw this book at a neighbour's garage sale I thought it might be worth reading. The Help is fiction that reads like non-fiction--probably because it is in large part based on some of the experiences the author had as a child growing up in Mississippi. She explains this in an additional section at the back of the book. The book tells the story of several black maids or house-helpers working for white families in the early 1960's in Jackson, Mississippi when racial segregation was the norm. The maids are at first reluctant to share their experiences fearing the backlash from their employers. But are persuaded by a young, ambitious white girl nicknamed Skeeter, who happens to be best friends with Hilly--the white girl who treats her own maid in an appalling manner. Losing friends, a boyfriend and falling rapidly out of fashion with the rest of her social circle, Skeeter eventually produces an anonymous book with fictional characters simply entitled Help. But what will happen in their small town if the book is published and people start to recognise themselves?The book is related in the first person by several of the maids and by Skeeter herself. The chapters alternate between the different characters. The perspectives are incredibly realistic and the characters well developed on both sides of the racial divide. There are, of course, characters that don't fit the racial stereotypes or don't behave in the prescribed manner--characters who revert to human kindness and temporarily forget the entrenched segregation. It is difficult to see who is more shocked by this--their peers or the maids themselves.\"She clear her throat again and I'm wondering why she telling me all this. I'm the maid, she ain't gone win no friends talking to me.\"The thing I liked best about this book was the fact that the author made it clear that the maids had both good and bad experiences depending on who they worked for. There were clearly employers who went out of their way to demonstrate care and compassion but others who treated the maids like trash on the street. It is a good reminder for us, as Christians, that cultural division and attitudes are not an excuse for sinful behaviour. We all have a choice. Just because everyone is doing something doesn't make it right--we should listen to our consciences, not over-ride them. The Help is also a reminder that God sees what we are doing in secret even though others may not know about it. The book written by the maids exposed all of the behaviours of the employers that they had no doubt expected to be kept hidden--the good, the bad and the ugly. We need to remember that God sees all of our dealings with others and He will hold us to account.This book is a page turner, the author somehow makes every-day details interesting and I was hooked. I wanted to give it 5 stars and I would have done but for the bad language and fairly regular blasphemy--there are at least fifty swear words in the book. There is limited violence and a scene where a man exposes himself which some readers might find offensive although it wasn't especially graphic. There are also some graphic details of a miscarriage which may upset some people.I recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1712389-joanna", "userReview": "I've completed 69% of this book on Kindle, and must wait a week to read the rest. Roger is taking my Kindle to Ireland, so I'll be reading a different \"real\" book this week.I LOVE this book, with it being one of my favorite book ever. The Help is well written and well researched, giving unique insight into the black maids living and working in the southern US during the early 60's. As a child growing up in Atlanta, Lillie Frazier came to our house three times a week. She loved and nurtured me in a way that noone else ever did. She taught me about the power of faith and the power of prayer. I was her favorite and she was my favorite - and everyone knew it! Lillie attended my graduations from high school and college. She remembered my birthday each year, and was always happy to see me come in the door from school. I baked her a pound cake for Christmas each year, and fussed at my brothers if they treated her with anything less than respect. After Roger and I married, Lillie retired. She phoned me every week or so, giving me support and advice about raising my own children. I visited her twice with the my kids before her death a little over 10 years ago. The character of Aibeleen was cut from the same mold, from the hugs and positive words to the indirect but powerful way that she taught me that the quality of the person is unrelated to the color of his/her skin.What a beautiful, appropriate ending to a terrific book. Definately this book receives my two thumbs up!"}, {"userName": "Tran Thanh Tu", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51182413-tran-thanh-tu", "userReview": "I've gotta say, this is truly one of the best hand-writings I have ever read in my whole life. From my point of view, the story tells us exactly about the life of people living in Mississipi, America in the 19s. With such wonderful eyesight, Kathryn Stockett has created a novel including different characters with their own special personalities which, on a whole, describes a small society of white people living with their maids - the colored ones. I enjoy seeing the characters' unique ways of thinking that builds up the main idea of the story. I truly, honestly adore this book since I watched the movie on TV and it helps me broaden my mind as well as knowledge about different lives and people living and working their arse up for a living. But after all, I think that we are all humans living in the same home called Earth. It is true that we have different skin colors but honestly that is not the factor we should care about. We live and eat the same way so why don't we respect one another equally?Last but not least, I highly recommend this book for someone who is looking for a new kind of perspective in reading, who is willing to listen to people's POVs and understand that not everyone is as they seem."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1795605-suzanne", "userReview": "This first novel by Kathryn Stockett is amazing. This is one of those few books that grabbed my emotions and interest so deeply that I could not stop thinking about the book when I would set it down to attend to other activities (like eating, sleeping & working!). I was engrossed and couldn't wait to read more, while at the same time savoring every chapter as the story developed. Stockett makes the characters come to life with her scene and character descriptions; writing in the 'voices' of black maids and nannies in Jackson, MS in the early 1960s when and where the Civil Rights movement was getting dangerously heated. Her other lead narrator, Skeeter Phelan, is a young white woman of privilege who portrays the unintended ignorance of many white people - especially in the South in those times. As Skeeter becomes more aware of the blatant racism, bigotry and hatred exhibited by people she considered life-long friends, her eyes are slowly opened to the humanity of others. This book is now on my list of all-time favorites and I recommend everyone read it for a deeper, personalized understanding of just how far the country has come since the Civil Rights Law was passed, as well as to enjoy a truly well-written novel."}, {"userName": "Evelyn (devours and digests words)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38658747-evelyn-devours-and-digests-words", "userReview": "This book tackles the issue of racism (among other things) in 1960's Jackson, Mississippi. I cannot stress this enough but  The Help is seriously one of the most important story I've ever read. Since it's about civil rights movement, I first thought it would be boring, depressing and drawn out, but I was wrong. There are so many kinds of moments that made me laugh out loud, tear up, smile, and scowl. I really felt all the emotions here.The story is told in three different perspectives: Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter.Both Aibileen and Minny work as a maid in the white people's households. They tend to all the cleaning and cooking. Sometimes they even help raise the white children like one of their own.The biting irony of it all is that eventhough coloured maids help raise the kids for the white parents, they are not allowed to share the same toilets in the house because of some stupid theories.\n\"All these houses they\u2019re building without maid\u2019s quarters? It\u2019s just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different kinds of diseases than we do.\"\nThey are also banned from eating at the same tables, attending the same schools, funerals & hospitals, and also despite their hard work around the clock, they're still paid way below their minimum wages. It's quite disgusting. Never mind the piss poor pay, what about the abuses they all have to suffer in the households? Some got sexually assaulted, verbally insulted, and physically injured. So yeah, things were clearly out of hands in Jackson, but people either sweep it under the rug or are simply too afraid to speak out. It frustrates me to no end.This is where Miss Skeeter Phelan comes into the picture. Eventhough she's white, she's one of those few who disagrees with the 'rules' and even went as far as trying to change how things work in her town by collecting most of the maids' stories (some harrowing, some touching) and bind them all together to form one book: Help by Anonymous. It's one small chance to raise awareness in their town, but she never stepped down despite knowing the terrible consequences it could cause both her and the other coloured maids.Skeeter may be the most underestimated person among her peers but she still rose up for herself with two of the things she's very good at: Writing and speaking out.She made it through all by herself despite the heartbreaks, alienation and obstacles, and whatever happened she still remains true to her ultimate goal. Because of this she has gained my utmost admiration and respect.Then there is Aibileen whose motherly affections made me feel warm all over. It took like 0.5 seconds to make me root for her. Her story really reached out to me. This woman lost her only son in the hands of the 'system', but still spends decades teaching and ingraining kindness & self-love in white kids.Anytime she gets the chance, she would remind little Mae Mobley this...\nYou kind, you smart, you important.\nWhereas, Minny is a different animal altogether. She can sass you till you drop and boy is she not afraid to strike back twice as hard when someone wronged her. Honestly, she made such a great change when everyone else is too afraid to stand up for themselves. I wouldn't mess with her and her chocolate pies if I were you.So what I'm trying to say is... each of these women are strong in their own individual ways. Their voices is just as equally powerful and sound. This makes it real hard for me to choose my favourite among the MCs. God help me but I just want to reach out into the story, pull everyone together and give them a big fat hug. Something else that brought my attention (and won more of my affecrion for the book) is how Stockett didn't define people by their skin colour. It is true that along the way, I've witnessed cruelty, elitism and injustice on the white people's part. But there is also a shred of kindness & gratitude on some of their behalf. \nAll I\u2019m saying is, kindness don\u2019t have no boundaries.\nI think the strongest message this book has ever delivered is how it tells us that it is not entirely black and white here. Peel off that skin: black or white (hell, maybe even yellow), and you'll still see red flesh, red blood and white bones underneath. \n\"Everbody know colored people and white people ain\u2019t the same. But we still just people!\" \n30th Jan '16.WHAT AN EMOTIONAL TRAINWRECK.This book was quite simply beautiful and eye-opening. I'm so glad I didn't decide to ignore it or I would have missed out on a lot of important stuffs.The hype for this one?

I read this powerful book about 4 years ago. The movie is good but the book is WAY BETTER! Kathryn Stockett is a beautiful and gifted writer.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone. Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken. Minny, Aibileen\u2019s best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody\u2019s business, but she can\u2019t mind her tongue, so she\u2019s lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own. Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed. In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women\u2014mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends\u2014view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don\u2019t.", "title": "The Help", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10966007-the-help", "average": 4.46, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1303597269l/10966007.jpg", "reviews": 79966, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1943477.Kathryn_Stockett", "name": "Kathryn Stockett"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Historical", "Adult", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10966007-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4667024-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6588662-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4670449-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7856358-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8139820-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11974606-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33869531-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7036023-of-love-and-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14595334-cliffsnotes-on-stockett-s-the-help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
