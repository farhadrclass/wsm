Which, in fact, you do! But Mawer isn't after writing a Robert Ludlum thriller. He offers us a subtle, mannered take on a well-worn theme: how war forces the most ordinary amongst us to behave in the most extraordinary ways. With prose that is distant and spare, Mawer sets the tone of isolation experienced by his young protagonist, Marian Sutro, as she is recruited and trained by the little-known British Special Operations Executive (SOE) and dropped by parachute into Southwestern France. Marian is determined to be of use and to succeed, but her motivations aren't clear. From an upper-middle class family, she has been spared the worst of the war's deprivations and has no family members in combat. Only memories of her teenage crush, a older French man who remains in Paris, tie her to her mother's homeland. She is a restless and intelligent, but hardly strikes one as a tough, street smart spy. And as it turns out, the SOE's motives are even more shadowy. Of course, all spies are pawns. What makes Trapeze so unique - with its quiet suspense and undercurrent of dread - is how deeply Marian and the reader are drawn into the conspiracy, how inexorably Marian's nature leads her to play precisely the role that has been designed for her. And like most realistic portrayals of war, there are long stretches of lethargy, of waiting, followed by bursts of adrenalin, terror and split-second decisions that a spy's highly-trained body and mind are designed to handle.The brevity of Marian's training is the only jarring note. Marian spends six weeks on an island off the coast of Scotland and emerges a lethal weapon. She becomes skilled in radio communication, ciphers, firearms, explosives, hand-to-hand combat -- it's a disbelief-suspending transformation from a soft, naive girl into a trained assassin with the survival instincts of a fox and the killer reactions of a tiger. Trapeze is a based on the true story, so perhaps this short training period is accurate. It's hard to imagine, really. But again, Mawer's theme runs through: do any of us really know the depth of our own character - its weakness or its power - until we are faced with desperate times?I made a comment the other day on Twitter that I felt \"character-driven\" to be one of the most useless descriptors of literary fiction. To my surprise, my off-hand remark was retweeted numerous times by writers and book fans. Apparently, my words touched nerve. Had I more than 140 characters to express myself, I would asked: if one says a novel is character-driven, what is the alternative? What well-crafted story isn't character driven? Story IS character, as much as it is plot- it is the behavior, action and reaction of the protagonist and ancillaries within and to their environment. A great story is one that wraps you in the characters' world, whether that world is a disintegrating marriage or an exploding planet of some distant universe. Or the shadowed streets and freezing lofts of Occupied Paris. What leads me to finally reject the notion of \"character-driven\" as reductive is Simon Mawer's restrained Trapeze. The author does a superb job of taking fiction's inextricably-linked elements - setting, plot, character, theme - and distilling them into the essence of a perfect story."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 because I like the way he ended it realistically.

Marian Sutro is beautiful, sassy, romantic and insubordinate to superior officers \u2013 so more like the 21st century heroine of an action film than a convincing portrait of a woman of her times. This though enables the author to crank up the tension in a way that wouldn\u2019t be possible perhaps with a more realistic, cautious, self-effacing and less attractive heroine. Otherwise the research was impressive and gave a good idea of what these brave women went through. That said, the first hundred pages dealing with Marian\u2019s training rather dragged because of his insistence to cram in all this research without really ever successfully dramatizing it. The novel greatly improved when Marian arrives in France and her deadly hide-and-seek game with the Gestapo begins. An entertaining read which gathers tension and pace half way through. Having said that I suspect those great old British films Carve Her Name with Pride and Odette were far more realistic and so moving in depicting what these brave women went through."}, {"userName": "Flo", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16328029-flo", "userReview": "I bought this book because every previous book I read by Simon Mawer was excellent. Sad to say, this book comes no where near his previous standard. The plot is plain silly, the heroine ditto and so is the writing. If you read Sweet Tooth by Ian McEwan you will understand how an intelligent Britain based wartime spy story should be written. This one is about a young half British/French girl who is transferred from her position as an ordinary WAC (the British equivalent is apparently called a FANY) because of her knowledge of French and her acquaintance as a young girl with a youth who has become a famed French physicist and on whom she had an enormous crush. She's dropped into France undercover in order to persuade this physicist to come to England and join the war effort to build an atomic bomb and as well as to replace 2 crystals required by a colleague transmitting out of Paris, the crystals lodged safely in her vagina. She meets him in Paris and says probably 5 times: \"I'm not a child any more.\" Is this an invitation? He's now married with a child. She breaks cover on every other page and although is at the end (SPOILER ALERT) compromised she insists on staying on in France to do what...I can think of nothing else except falling into the hands of the gestapo and revealing all the names of the people she has been in contact with. This cannot be the same writer as the writer of The Glass House. I do not recommend this book to anyone."}, {"userName": "Nicki", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8593868-nicki", "userReview": "I hoped for more from this novel. The protagonist, Marian/Anne-Marie/Alice is a difficult character to warm to and the novel relies heavily on her being an interesting and accessible character because she's our way in. I found Marian spiky, aloof and quite irritating, especially as an agent in training. Apart from anything else, she blabs about her exciting new venture immediately after being explicitly told not to tell anyone. The novel doesn't really take off until Marian, now known as Alice, arrives in France, but even then I found all the stuff with Clement quite tiresome, both the science and the romance. The best bits were when Alice found herself in trouble, but that was only maybe 10% of the book. Stories about SOE agents in France are normally a honeytrap for me, but this one didn't really hit the spot. If you want to read a really good novel about a female SOE agent, read Code Name Verity. You won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802440-cynthia", "userReview": "In war there\u2019s a fine line between being alive and being fully human.I enjoyed this book immensely. \u201cTrapeze\u201d centers around a young English woman, Marian Sutro, who\u2019s recruited to be a spy embedded in France. Marian is the daughter of an English diplomat and a French woman. She grows up in Switzerland where her father is stationed. She\u2019s the adored younger sister of a brilliant scientist brother. She\u2019s also adored by and adoring of her brother\u2019s fellow scientist Clement. Mawer quickly catches the romance of the times as well as the danger and horror. Marian goes on a crash course as one of only two women who are learning skills that will keep them alive in France and that will enable them to help the French continue their resistance. She learns that a momentary loss of awareness could cost her her life as well as the lives of the people she\u2019s trying to help. She lives in fear. Mawer is skilled at setting impactful scenes with few words. Marian\u2019s thoughts and predicament seem very real and Mawer\u2019s attention to details is exquisite. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re walking the dangerous war time Paris streets right next to Marian.Interestingly Mawer briefly ties in Leo Marks\u2019 work as presented in Marks\u2019 fascinating nonfiction work \u201cBetween Silk and Cyanide: a Code Makers War\u201d*.

Interesting story about a young woman from England who goes to France to work with the Resistance during World War II. I enjoyed the story learning about these women that sacrificed their relative comfort and safety in London to go into a vastly different environment in order to help the war efforts. I must say it was a bit tedious. My normal complaint of many male authors applies here. It was far too detail oriented in a story where in my mind it wasn't needed. I am sure there are many others that will disagree finding it fascinating. For me though, it just wasn't needed. Still a good read though."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "This novel was left open ended in the manner of an ongoing thriller series. The next book, Tightrope, is due out in November 2015 published by Other Press. Mawer choses a nineteen-year-old British espionage agent as his central character, based on the background of a real group of women, half-French, who are recruited and trained to infiltrate France during the Second World War on behalf of British Intelligence. Mawer sticks to the personal in this novel, and does not venture out into the war at large: fighting, tactics, or even soldiers. We are invited to imagine the possibility of several countries\u2019 scientists all striving to be the first to realize a nuclear option. The Americans were working on their own bomb, and the Germans were doing what they could. Occupied France had some scientists with knowledge, if not capability, and the British science regime was looking to bring in those Frenchmen to aid their efforts while keeping those secrets from the Germans.We get a detailed look at the women\u2019s recruitment, training in Scotland, and deployment in France. They were so young: perhaps that made them braver. Some were better at the spycraft than others and they quickly learned to pick those they admired when possible on assignments. Others of their team they learned to be wary of, but when wariness wasn\u2019t enough, they had to treat their teammates like the explosive charges they were, at any moment threatening to blow their cover.The Second World War is a convenient catalyst to writers and filmmakers because it throws human desire and capability into extremis. Mawer attempts to show the ordinary daily life of a spy: lots of waiting punctuated by shattering terror. Mawer\u2019s research on the work of preparation and infiltration was capable enough, but I wasn\u2019t completely convinced by his female lead. I understand the excitement generated by imagining real young women being dropped by parachute into France in the dead of night, but somehow that excitement did not communicate itself to me, perhaps because the ground is thoroughly churned and picked over for nuggets. Although Mawer did a marvelous job with his female-centered World War II novel The Glass Room, this novel left me wondering why he chose to use a female central character. Marian\u2019s name changes throughout the novel, to Anne-Marie, to Alice, to Laurence. Her skills and motivations change also, becoming more practiced, seasoned, and hardened with each iteration of her identity. But because the novel is so intensely personal, we might expect to share more of her secret internal thoughts--about her lovers, about her colleagues--rather than just the face she shows to the world. Mawer does this is some extent, but I just wasn\u2019t convinced. I couldn\u2019t have done that job, which is why I may have needed more clarity. Perhaps there are people out there who do not have agonized internal conversations about who their duplicitous lives as spies are helping. Maybe it was just like Mawer says: a young woman accepts a commission to risk her life undercover overseas without even knowing which division of British Intelligence she worked for. Maybe that\u2019s why they needed them young. However interesting it is to imagine such a wildly impetuous jump into the deep end--meeting a former boyfriend and nuclear scientist in Paris, and trying to get him to fly to Britain without much convincing dialogue--I find it infinitely more gratifying to read about, work with, and follow someone with a little more maturity and doubt.But I have read so much about the Second World War that it takes some really spectacular writing and imagining to bring me anything new. I was the one who thought All the Light We Cannot See was a Young Adult title. So don\u2019t listen to me. If espionage is your thing, this may be just the ticket. But read it now, so you can move on to Tightrope when it comes out in November."}, {"userName": "Anastasia Fitzgerald-Beaumont", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3044221-anastasia-fitzgerald-beaumont", "userReview": "The Girl Who Fell from the Sky \u2013 published in the US as Trapeze - is a thriller, a spy story, a coming of age narrative, a tale of sexual awakening, of self-discovery, of the terrors of working under an assumed name in a land occupied by a malign presence. The life that it has is all that it has, and it\u2019s yours and yours and yours! Is it mine? The honest answer is that I\u2019m not at all sure. It\u2019s the first novel I\u2019ve read by Simon Mawer, though his much lauded The Glass Room is in my collection and begging my attention. The Girl in question is Marian Sutro, plucked from obscurity to become an agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), a British wartime organisation set up, amongst other things, to aid local resistance movements in Europe against the Nazi occupiers. Marian\u2019s appeal, like so many of the real women who worked for SOE, is that she is fluent in French. But as there are secrets within secrets and agencies within agencies, her additional appeal is that she happens to be on past familiar terms with a French nuclear scientist by the name of Cl\u00e9ment Pelletier. Living in Paris, he is wanted by those stumbling towards the creation of an atomic bomb. After training in all sorts of secret agent techniques, she is dropped from the sky into south-west France, there to work with the resistance. That\u2019s dangerous enough, but her ultimate task is even more perilous \u2013 she has to go to Paris, an anxious city in the grip of hunger and in the grip of fear. The Girl Who Fell from the Sky is a good little book with a good big book struggling to get out and not quite making it. I honestly don\u2019t know why I picked it up now, other than for a spot of undemanding holiday reading. Certainly the subject matter interests me, the stories of the remarkable women of SOE, women like Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom and Anne-Marie Walters, known simply as Colette, to whom the novel is dedicated. But chiefly what I think I was looking for was an understanding of what it was like to live under extreme conditions, an understanding of what Paris was like during the occupation. I was looking for something exceptional. There are exceptional parts which makes the unexceptional all the more striking. Mawer\u2019s descriptive power is excellent at points. The Paris scenes are full of mounting, heart-pounding tension. I give you one passage which I found particularly striking:An old man peers out from behind a heap of used clothes. He\u2019s as wrinkled as a walnut and wears a woollen cap on his head that makes her think of the tumbrels that rolled through the city during the Terror. This is the new terror, with new myths and new nightmares. Indeed there are. This is not a city to stop and stare, for if one does someone else stops and stares right back; if you gaze into the abyss the abyss will gaze back into you. This is not a city for the unprepared or the unwary. The atmosphere of tension and dread is constructed with considerable skill but, alas, only a fairly small part of the book is set in the streets of Paris. Just as much time is spent on Marian\u2019s soulful and, at points, tiresome reunion with Cl\u00e9ment. For a scientist of such importance he is a person in whom the Nazis take surprisingly little interest.Mawer is good on the detail of espionage. I feel sure that he carried out a lot of research on techniques and training. Clearly in this sort of work detail is everything, the narrow margin between life and death. Marian goes to France as Alice, into a darker Wonderland. Amongst other things she is told not to ask for sugar for her coffee because there isn\u2019t any. Such a request would mark her out as a stranger. Surprisingly, though, she is not told to avoid smoking on her own \u2013 something she only discovers when she arrives \u2013, because women did not get a tobacco ration. Mawer would do well himself to pay closer attention to detail. At one point his God-like narrator says the various materials dropped by the RAF to the resistance was like \u201cone of those cargo cults in the Pacific islands.\u201d Yes, sure, but that is not a contemporary perspective. The cults he is referring to are a post-war phenomenon. This comment marks him out as a stranger! I don\u2019t want to give too much away in spoilers but I feel sure that the real SOE must have been much more thorough in their vetting and training. Speaking French like a native simply would not have been enough. Early on I spotted Yvette as an obvious weak link, a girl who volunteers simply because she wants to go home. Marian befriends her but it was to be a particularly dangerous friendship. One would have to be a fool not to know the reason why eyes were turned on Marian on her second visit to Paris. He task was to get Cl\u00e9ment and Cl\u00e9ment alone. All other considerations should have been abandoned. Tragically for her they were not. The Girl Who Fell from the Sky is a rattling good yarn when it isn\u2019t a boring digression into the ins and outs of Marian\u2019s emotional and sex life. There is colour but not enough. There is character but not enough. There is tension, real tension at points, but not enough. Marian\u2019s first encounter with the Germans, for example, which should have been a moment of high anxiety, is curiously flat. I also wonder if Mawer was getting a bit tired towards the end because the scene where his heroine and Cl\u00e9ment part is a commendable exercise in bathos and clich\u00e9! What happens afterwards is sad but for me not unexpected. She should have left when she had the chance. I would have. It was the right thing to do. She should have been ordered out, a danger to herself and everyone she worked with. I\u2019m sounding a bit too negative. I really don\u2019t want to give you the impression that I did not enjoy this book because I did\u2026up to a point. It\u2019s a good read, not a great one. That\u2019s the problem: I was expecting more. The Glass Room I hope will be more."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "Marian Sutro is a young woman from Geneva, with an English father and a French mother.

Readers are immediately drawn into this novel by its main character, Marian Sutro, a young woman wondering what her place is in the fighting of World War II. Marian is the daughter of an English father and a French mother, and is bilingual, making her the perfect addition to the French Section of the Special Operations Executive, or the SOE. The SOE was an actual Operation that sent thirty-nine women into the field between May 1941 and September 1944. Mawer has taken this fact and created an unforgettable heroine and a war story filled with spies and intrigue. Marian is put through rigorous training and is to be dropped into France when she is questioned by two gentlemen who seem to be privy to personal details of her past. Her girlhood crush and a longtime friend of the family, Clement Pelletier is still in Paris, where he is still working as a physicist. As the war escalates it becomes evident that science will somehow play a role in ending the war, and Pelletier is wanted in England by the Allies. Marian\u2019s initial mission of being dropped into Southern France to assist the Resistance now takes on a more dangerous and emotional element.

Tossing and turning in bed after I'd finished the last page. I suppose this is not a book to finish just before bedtime, as it did not sit well. First off, it's a total cliffhanger which if doing a trilogy or a series I enjoy. It usually makes me excited to read the next, but this was more flat than exciting. I was more disappointed. Marian Sutro, a young woman chosen by the SOE (Special Operations Executive) to be trained and sent to France as a spy is an interesting woman. She is not flat by all means. In fact she is rather interesting, and very intricate. She has layers that are not uncovered fully throughout the book but I believe this builds a wonderful character, and allows you to grow with them as they grow. All of the relationships in the book minus the one with Clement were 5-star. Her interactions with Benoit, Yvette and Ned kept the book alive for me. I wanted to know more. Who is Yvette? What are her real qualities? Can Marian love Benoit? Can Benoit love Marian? It was all a bit of a roller coaster, but Marian seemed to mesh well with these characters. It seemed to carry the story in an interesting way, rather than falling short and making me feel full of nothing the way the interactions with Clement were. Clement was my real disappointment. Why did Marian not feel more when revealed that he was married with a child? Why did this not break her down the way it should have? Why did Clement not say more... about Marian, rather than acting like a child about her being sent away to school... it seemed sloppy. As if the author had a grand plan in place for Marian and Clement, but had run away with the wonderful idea of Marian and Benoit. I wanted more angst, but was left feeling bitterly cold. Marian was never depicted as bitterly cold. A bit stoic at times, but when description of Clement came to mind she was bubbly, happy, almost giddy. The marriage of Clement should have been devastating. The advances Clement made should have been more effective, instead of Marian claiming she was no longer a child a hundred times. This is the point of the book I started to get disappointed, and began over-analyzing all the other pieces. The training part of the story was good, but could have been more exciting. I think Simon Mawer is an excellent writer with a gift of description, though does not use it in times that are important. I do not care to know all the details of a Paris street that has no meaning. I want to know more about espionage training, how they could turn such a head-strong, stubborn woman such as Marian into a rather tough, and scary woman with an excellent gift of concealment. In addition, once placed in France, it felt as though Marian didn't do very much. The description of her first parachutage was good, interesting and exciting but is that all she did once placed? Surely, the SOE wasn't sending women and men over to do nothing all day? This is a fundamental flaw of the book, that although could mean nothing should the rest of the book hold-up, did not sit well with me in the end. We spent more time learning how to travel and not look scared than knowing what it was that Marian actually did. Lastly, I was in absolute shock at the end. I supposed it was nice to be thrilled by Marian's actions, but there was no hint, no glimmer of her pretending to go with Clement and then jumping the plane at the last second. There was no inclination that Marian had felt the need to do that. It was shocking, and unsettling to say the least. I was not at all impressed, and then the last few pages where a whirlwind of confusion. Simon Mawer lost his excellent skill of description, and fell short with coded meanings and difficult plot advancement. Overall - I think this was a good book. Well written characters, and interesting plot but I am not sure if I could read a sequel. I might just to see if Simon had redeemed himself, as a lot of series novels are not good in the beginning but good enough to interest you and this is definitely an interesting read. I enjoyed the characters more than anything else in the book and would enjoy to find Simon has developed them more.

Had the author simply stuck to this idea, we may have been given a better result.As it is, we have a slow, turgid novel which barely gets going at all until the last few chapters, wrapped up in a load of completely inappropriate and often embarrassing, florid passages.Firstly, to begin to appreciate much of this extraneous verbiage, the reader needs to be not only fluent in French, but au fait with French slang. If long, and seemingly important passages from another language are going to be used in a book, then they need to be explained. The author surely realizes this, as at one point, he invokes some (again, unnecessary) German language into the narrative, which is neatly translated so that the impact of the words aren't lost on the reader. But using half a dozen different slang words for German soldiers, with little or no explanation, simply ends up confusing the reader, adding yet another diversion away from the main plot.Then there are the strange English words introduced as well. \"Fasty\" is one such word. Was it a typo? Was it meant to be like \"Fastish\", as in \"rapidly\"? Or was it something to do with not eating? Impossible to tell - but yet another unnecessary distraction. Then there is the constant \"poorly written sex pieces\" - most of which is again completely and utterly unnecessary to the plot, and is usually completely embarrassing even when reading it in private. The thought of even going into detail in illustrating some of this stuff is stomach churning in itself \u2013 it\u2019s stuff I\u2019d sooner forget, but I fear that some of it will remain as an unpleasant image in my mind\u2019s eye for far too long.On a broader level, the characters are paper thin, as well as being all quite unsavoury \u2013 it really is difficult to empathise with any of them, particularly our main protagonist. The difficulty is further exacerbated by the fact that the plot goes to great lengths to try and hammer home how our character is trained to behave by her spymasters \u2013 and then she almost immediately goes out and acts in an opposite way, with no reflection at all on her misdoings. Is the author trying to make too clever a point here (another possibly recurring theme throughout this dreadful novel) or is it just sloppy writing?Then there is completely inappropriate use of metaphor and imagery. At one stage he invokes a \u201cturd at the backside of an elegant old lady\u201d. Interesting imagery. To what could he be referring to? Would you believe that he was simply talking about a brown van parked outside the back of a college? And so the complete embarrassment goes on. Even the ending is a straight lift from one of the best known WW2 escape films. Not even a pretence to change much of the detail. Another piece of deep and meaningful imagery? No, by this stage you know it\u2019s just sloppy, lazy writing, confirming finally the growing sense of unease and disbelief that any editor has allowed 90% of this book to be printed.A real shocker."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul", "userReview": "It is the second world war and Marion who is in the services is selected by SOE as she can speak fluent French.

After a couple of other courses, including getting her wings, she is ready for her first assignment in France.She is approached by another secret organisation that want her to meet with an old flame called Clement in Paris. he is working on atomic research, and the British want him to defect. She is parachuted into France, with a man called Benoit and is met by the resistance and is immersed into the local community awaiting the call from London. Shortly after that, she gets the call and she is to delivery some crystals to another agent in Paris.She meets the other agent in Paris, Yvette, who is living in terror as she thinks her cover is blown, and meets with Clement. She is slightly shocked to find that he is married now, but starts trying to persuade him to come to the UK. As the Nazi authorities close in on her, she realises that every wrong step could be fatal.Overall is isn't a bad spy thriller. It is loosely based on a female spy called Anne-Marie, who was active during the Nazi occupation of France. It is a little predictable at times, and the beginning is quite slow paced whilst she undergoes training. The pace really does lift at the end, but it doesn't have the subtlety and darker elements that some one like Le Carre has.

It's not a bad novel, but it doesn't measure up to the depth of The Glass Room. Three and a half years into the Second World War, a young British woman is recommended for special espionage work in France. Her mother is French, and Marian grew up in France and Switzerland, so she's perfect for the assignment. She goes into it knowing the dangers, and, in fact, seems to relish the risks she has to take. Mawer does a good job building suspense, and I have to say that the book is definitely a page turner. But I'm not sure that he does an effective job with the female voice.

The SOE trained these women for espionage and all types of weapon use. Dropped into France, in secret, they became different people, and they performed whatever assignments they were given, often completely on their own, facing untold danger. Many did not survive the effort.The author, Simon Mawer, introduces us to Marian Sutro when she is a young girl of 19. A member of the WAF, she is recruited into this spy machine and parachuted into France with several new identities. She enters the maelstrom of war, young and a bit na\u00efve, however, she is forced to mature quickly. She and other recruits become romantically involved with each other, although it is against regulations, so in addition to this exciting tale of espionage, there are forbidden romantic liaisons and love stories taking place. Romance can fog the mind and compromise their ability to think clearly, but the constant danger makes them behave carelessly and foolishly sometimes. There is always so much at stake; this behavior becomes a release for tension. Marian\u2019s mission is of the highest priority and her life is always in danger. There is no shortage of mystery or intrigue. We witness murder and betrayal, fear and courage, in the face of monumental danger. If caught, awful consequences await them.This historic piece of fiction, about a group of people engaged in the effort to end World War II that I had never heard about before, is really engaging and eye opening. Working alongside freedom fighters who often believed that the women were unworthy of the task, whose beauty was distracting, they must nevertheless prove themselves and do their job in the face of the resistance, rudeness, and mistrust.I particularly liked the descriptive use of language. It made what might have been a mundane spy story, leap off the page. There was little use of crude language, inappropriate sex and whatever other contrivance other writers of late seem to be wont to do; instead, Mawer uses the language effectively to tell the story by creating images that are revealing. For instance, body odor is the scent from an armpit, an image the reader can appreciate.I found the reader of this audio to be excellent. Her vocal expression made the content clear. Her use of voices brought the characters to life and her tone seemed pitch perfect to me."}, {"userName": "Dolf Patijn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3303223-dolf-patijn", "userReview": "This is a riveting Second World War espionage novel with a strong, female protagonist. In WW II it wasn't just men who fought and women doing office jobs and nursing because there were women who played an important role in occupied countries. In the Netherlands there were girls like Hannie Schaft (the girl with the red hair). Theun de Vries wrote a book about this courier for the Dutch resistance. In Germany there was Sophie Scholl, one of the leaders of the White Rose resistance group. In France 15 to 20 % of the resistance fighters were female but only a few were personally honoured like Marinette Menut, Simone Segouin, Bertie Albrecht, Delphine Aigle and Claude Rodier. The year is 1943. The protagonist in \"The Girl Who Fell From The Sky\" is Marian Sutro, a woman with an English father and French mother who lives in England and serves with the WAAF (Women's Auxiliary Air Force) as a plotter in an operations room. Because she speaks French fluently, she is asked to train as an agent and go into France to help the resistance. The books starts with Marian on the plane, ready to be dropped over France, but then moves back in time to when she was approached and did her training. The first part of the book is taken up with her training and gives us time to get to know Marian a bit better and gives an insight in wartime British intelligence. It gets more exciting when she's dropped over France, starts her mission and finds out that her training hasn't completely prepared her for the real-life situation in an occupied country. The tension becomes palpable and it becomes hard to put the book down.This seems like a straightforward, well-crafted spy thriller, but it is also a novel about the choices that people make, taking responsibility, getting to know your own strengths and weaknesses and putting your own interests aside for a greater good, despite the risks.Simon Mawer has a nice style of writing and doesn't overdramatise. The story is well-researched and although he could have elaborated a bit more about life in occupied France and let tension built up for a bit longer, he knows how to evoke an atmosphere of wartime France in a few, well-chosen occurrences and incidents which makes for a believable story and an unputdownable book.NB: Simon Mawer wrote a second book about the same protagonist called Tightrope, which was published in 2015."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/170420-laura", "userReview": "Recently I had a conversation with someone about the Holocaust; we agreed that those with direct experience would be gone in the next 10-15 years, and that the memories of those with direct experience were (now) fading or being lost to old age. So it's not surprising that the children of those people are striving to keep those memories alive and to honor their parents' experience.In this case, the author is writing (loosely) about a friend of her parents, a woman who worked for the Special Operations Executive in France, helping the Resistance. Marian/Anne-Marie/Alice is working in the WAAF when she receives a letter asking her to come to a meeting - that meeting leads to a position in the SEO, training in armed combat, destruction, sabotage, espionage, resisting interrogation and Morse code, and ultimately an assignment in France as a sort of courier for the resistance. In addition to her SEO role, she's also been asked to meet with, and convince, her old crush, Clement Pelletier, now working as a physicist in Paris, working on a new type of bomb (the science of the bomb is explained, as is Shrodinger's cat, but not collapsing the wave function).As with any good spy novel, there's betrayal and tension, but this is slower paced than most in that genre. The psychological side isn't as intense, either. It was also a little odd to not get a better feel for what she did in the south of France - most of the action once she's in France is centered on her time in Paris, which is too bad as I think more about the courier work would have given us more of a flavor of what life was like during that time (something that I think most readers don't have, whereas life in Paris has been covered in other novels and movies).ARC provided by publisher."}, {"userName": "Robin Webster", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7548247-robin-webster", "userReview": "The main character of this novel is 23 year old Marian Sutro: fluent in both French and English. She is sought out by the Special Operations Executive to work undercover in occupied France.

However, her most important mission is to contact an old friend of her brother in Paris who is a nuclear physicist called Clement Pelletier and try to persuade him to return to England. Her relationship with Clement is also complicated by the fact that there was a strong attraction between them when they last had any contact when she was a young impressionable schoolgirl.I have a strong interest in the SOE and consider this to be a very well researched book. The story moves from Marian\u2019s recruitment, through to her training, then to her time in occupied France. I also felt that the author has a real quality to his writing and is able to evoke to the reader the fears and changing values that a previously innocent convent girl would have faced with the threat of death every minute of every day.However, I found the ending to this book far too abrupt and disappointing. I felt there should have been at least one more chapter. For me it felt that the author had had enough of writing the book and decided to end it there.

That's one of the things that war does. And we wonder too, if we were placed under such pressures as having our country occupied by an enemy, would we too do find ourselves doing extraordinary things? Almost immediately after France was occupied by Germany in 1940, General De Gaulle, from his base in London, as head of the Free French movement, called on his compatriots in France to resist the German occupation at all costs so as to keep France free and restore the glory of France. Just a month later, the British Government formed the Special Operations Executive, a largely secretive organisation that was to undertake a variety of tasks including espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in Europe against Germany and its allies, and to use and aid the local resistance movements to achieve these aims. The SOE depended for its success on recruiting agents who could pass as natives of the countries they were placed into. Dual citizenship, years of living in the subject country, fluency in the language, an affinity with the country were all qualities highly sought after. France was not the only country that the SOE operated in, but it is the subject of this novel, the latest by Simon Mawer, whose previous novel, 'The Glass Room' was short listed for the 2009 Man Booker Prize. Young Marian Sutro, with her English diplomat father, and her French mother has lived much of her life in Switzerland and also knows Paris very well. Marian works for the WAAF where her intelligence and steady nerves have her working in the Filter Room, a section of the Defence system where aircraft positions are plotted and recorded. She comes to the attention of a SOE recruiter. After having the dangers outlined to her, which are many, she agrees to join the SOE, and so her big adventure begins. She is sent to Scotland to a training facility where she undergoes a most extensive and intensive training course in all aspects of self-preservation, espionage, surveillance, wireless work and essentially survival.And finally comes her big moment of being parachuted into France to begin her big adventure. To this point the story has trundled along at quite a leisurely unexciting sort of pace - really setting the scene for the second half. We are introduced to her fellow 'students' at the training camp, especially Benoit and Yvette. We are also introduced to her brother Ned who is a physicist and read about a Frenchman, Clement, a slightly older family friend who she had a mad crush on during her teenage years and who is now a nuclear physicist still in occupied Paris. Once Marian, now Alice, and soon to take on a third identity, lands in France, we are immediately plunged into the adrenalin laced, terrifying, stressful, and exhausting life of the partisan/resistance worker. From the countryside of the still unoccupied south west France to German-infested Paris, Marian attempts to do the tasks she has been assigned. Which I won't divulge here! The contrast in the writing style is quite pronounced and the book very quickly becomes a page turner. While very much a tale of good vs evil, it is primarily the story of Marian's growth: from a young, naive, perhaps bit spoilt, bored girl into a highly trained, sophisticated, professional, self aware woman. And never once do you let your guard down.The stories of women resistance workers have been told many times and in many different forms over the decades. But whether they are true as in the life of Nancy Wake or fictional as in Sebastian Faulkes' 'Charlotte Grey' or William Boyd's 'Restless' they still have the ability to make us wonder how we would behave, leave us in awe and above all humble us.
