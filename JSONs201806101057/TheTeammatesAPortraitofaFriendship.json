Halberstam is most remembered for his Pulitzer winning The Best and Brightest but was also an avid sports fan. He listed Bob Knight as one of his closest friends and followed MichaelJordan for a season. Through Knight, Halberstam got a chance to meet his boyhood idol Ted Williams. The Teammates chronicles a sixty year friendship between Williams and his three teammates Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky, and Dominic DiMaggio on and off the playing field. In 2002, Ted Williams was dying. Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky decided to pay one last visit to their teammate before he succumbed to his illness. On the road, Halberstam looks back at the friendship these men formed while still minor leaguers in their teens. All four came from California and joined the Red Sox at relatively the same time in the late 1930s. The other three players complimented Williams on teams that competed for the pennant during the 1940s and maintained lasting friendships ever since. Halberstam touches on their playing days while also providing their routes to the big leagues as well as childhood and adult family life. All four players maintained distinct personalities- Williams the misunderstood, volatile superstar; Doerr the balanced persona who understood Williams better than anyone; DiMaggio the son of immigrants who struggled to emerge from his brother's shadow; and Pesky who had a greater work ethic than any of them and became a baseball lifer. This book was about the lives these men lead away from the field with baseball as a backdrop. Although touching at times, especially as Williams grappled with his final illness, I wanted the book to be more about the players actual time as teammates on the Red Sox than their personal lives off of it. In this age of social media, current players maintain accounts and we can follow their every movement off the field. The current World Series winners has a young core who appears close and could remain friends for the next sixty to seventy years. Halberstam has taken us to a wholesome, bygone era where players such as the Red Sox played on the same team for their whole career; however, fans did not know much about their personal lives. I enjoyed reading about these lives, especially those of the role players who are not as well documented as Williams. The day Williams and Doerr spent fly fishing off the Florida Keys was especially touching. It is quite remarkable that four big league players with distinct personalities remained friends for sixty plus years of their lives. What is more remarkable is that even in his final moments, Williams chose the company of his teammates over that of his family. Even though this is not his best work by far, Halberstam's journalistic skills are evident in this book. An easy read for a gloomy day in baseball's offseason, I rate The Teammates 3.5 cheery stars."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara", "userReview": "This portrait of 4 Boston Red Sox players - Ted Williams, Dominic DiMaggio (Joe's brother), Johnny Pesky ( the right field foul pole at Fenway Park is named for him), and Bobby Doerr. Bobby Doerr comes through as the most steady player, and all around great human being. He was Ted Williams' close friend and perhaps one of the few human beings who could put up with Williams' volatility. Doerr is the only one of the four who is still alive, age 99.Dom DiMaggio was the first major league baseball player to wear glasses! This was in the days before unbreakable lenses. They started him out in the outfield for this reason, but moved him to center field where he proved invaluable. The story of game 7 in the 1946 World Series represented for me the reason why fans continuously debate and relive plays and games. The injuries described were heartbreaking. The Sox were playing the Cardinals and DiMaggio hamstring suddenly gave out as he was running to second base. Pesky was blamed for the loss of this game, a story that the book debunks. This was one of those disasters in Red Sox history that kept them from winning the World Series until 2004. Everyone talks about Buckner's error in Game 6 in 1986 against the Mets, but the 1946 series was an even more \"tragic\".The Ted Williams era lasted from 1939-1960. During those years, Williams missed 5 seasons serving in World War II and the Korean War. Unlike the actor John Wayne who got a deferment because he had children, many baseball players went to war including all four players in this book Williams, Doerr, Pesky and DiMaggio. Williams is still the only player to bat .400 for a full season. He had a horrible childhood, and this most likely explains his difficult personality at times.Johnny Pesky was another unlikely athlete with his slight build. For years into his 80's, he still went to Fenway everyday helping with batting practice. In 1997, Pesky was kicked out of Fenway and told to turn in his uniform by new management. Ted Williams fought for his restoration and finally in 2002 under the new management of John Henry, he was invited back. Management changes and devaluing of players shouldn't have surprised me, but they did.  Details about the changes in treatments for injuries also interested me. I didn't realize how many years pitchers went for as long as 9 innings. Ouch. Players of the era these guys played earned modest salaries. So much has changed in baseball, but clearly the sport owes these four so much.Overall, good portrayals, writing, and history. A must read for Red Sox fans (this clearly influenced my rating:)."}, {"userName": "Pris robichaud", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1860127-pris-robichaud", "userReview": "They Killed My Father, Now They're Coming After Me, 10 May 2007 \"Marty Nolan, the former editorial page editor of the 'Boston Globe', once famously described the pain that came with being a Red Sox fan, \"They killed my father, now they're coming after me\". Johnny Pesky Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky were all members of the famed 1940's Boston Red Sox. Their careers led the Red Sox to a pennant championship and ensured the men a place in sports history. David Halberstam, had followed the members of the 1949 championship Boston Red Sox team for years, especially Williams, Doerr, DiMaggio, and Pesky. He met up with the fellas and learned about their friendship and their trip. He knew he wanted to write about it. David Halberstam gives us an inside look at how these four teammates became friends, and how that friendship thrived for more than 60 years. The book opens with Johnny Pesky, Dom DiMaggio and , Dick Flavin a friend, on a 1300-mile car trip travelling to see the ailing Ted Williams in Florida. It's the last time they will see him. The journey is filled with nostalgia and memories, but seeing Ted is a shock. The most physically dominating of the four friends, Ted now weighs only 130 pounds and is hunched over in a wheelchair. Dom, without even thinking about it, starts to sing opera and old songs like \"Me and My Shadow\" to his friend.They had a short memorable time with Ted,and it was worth it. Every morning until the day Ted Williams died, Dom would call him with an update of the Sox. \"This book is filled with stories of their wonderful days with the Boston Red Sox, memories of plays and players, and the reaction of the remaining three to Ted Williams' death. The Teammates offers us a glimpse into the lives of these Red Sox men. and great insight into the nature of loyalty and friendship. The book tries not to dwell on the imposing power, problems, and slugging achievements of Ted Williams or reveal new sensational material or revelations. Halberstam focuses on the teammates' shared attributes: their desire to compete and succeed in baseball, their willingness to learn how to use physical/mental talents, how to provide for post-depression families yet display genuine appreciation and gratitude for each other's contributions and careers.\" David Johnson For any Red Sox fan, baseball fan and David Halberstam fan this book is a must. A book of love of fellow man and baseball. It is a rare book that fills the reader with hope for the future of baseball.

All of them great players and great men. It is a story about aging, love, friendship, and baseball. One story is about the famous \"Pesky held the ball\" World Series of 1946. I actually went to that game inside my mother's womb. I always look at baseball as a prenatal love for me. In that game, Dom Dimaggio was hurt running the bases. He had to be replaced by Leon Culberson in center field. Culberson was not a good player, only made the team because of the WWII drain on players. With Enos Slaughter on first, Harry \"the Hat\" Walker came to the plate. Culberson should have moved more over to left center. Dom Dimaggio shouted out to him to move over, but got only a short move. The field itself was in poor condition. Slaughter ran on the pitch. Walker hit the ball to left center. With two outs, Slaughter intended to score knowing that Dimaggio was on the bench. Culberson was slow retrieving the ball and made a soft throw to Pesky. No tv replay existed then. Pesky was made the goat and accused of holding the ball. The players claim it was unfair. Pesky himself never tried to change the impression, believing he should never speak ill of a teammate, in this case Culberson. The saddest story is about Ted Williams. Seeing this great athlete age and be used by his own son, John Henry Williams. He used Ted to sell autographed baseballs when Ted was confined to a wheelchair and losing his edge. When Ted died, he was frozen in a cryogenic lab.

It follows the story of a few aged Red Sox players on their way to see their friend and teammate one last time as he lay dying in Florida. It's a touching story about how they stayed in touch for so long and it was sad all at the same time (and in fact really makes you focus on your own mortality, but the majority of the book is spent on each of the individuals and how they grew up and related to each other. I think the ultimate purpose was to endear the players to the reader and make you see what how the bond could have lasted as long as it was, but for some reason I felt like I wanted more of their interaction with each other (though not necessarily less of their own individual lives). I also had pictured Ted Williams as a more soft spoken, kind teacher type (though to be honest I never knew much about the man personally, and I base most of this off his book \"The Art of Hitting .300\"), not the boisterous, right winged, cantankerous man whom is described. It was fun however and very well written, much more so than any sports book I have read."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1136594-robert", "userReview": "This \"book\" contains some interesting anecdotes and provides a warm, sentimental portrayal of the friendships among Ted Williams and three of his teammates from the 1940's. It starts off, however, as a story about a trip to Florida to visit a dying Williams by two of the three. There is very little about the trip or their visit and perhaps there was nothing more to say. Still, it was a bit disappointing.It's also a little pathetic to have a Boston fan, Halberstam, trying to blame the condition of Sportsman's Park (home of the 1946 Cardinals) for the Red Sox' loss to the Cards in the 1946 World Series.Anyway, it seems like Halberstam was looking for a place to sell some of the unused research he had done in writing his book about the 1949 season."}, {"userName": "Brad Lyerla", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla", "userReview": "The TEAMMATES is David Halberstam\u2019s book about the lifelong friendship between Boston Red Sox teammates Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky. It is a quick read and full of information that may not be widely known even among avid baseball fans.First, Ted Williams\u2019 mother was Mexican. How is this not better known? Williams\u2019 family was a burden to him. His father was at best neglectful, and possibly abusive. His mother troubled him for money regularly. His brother grew up to be a felon.Second, Ted Williams had anger issues and a very foul mouth. He was widely disliked among baseball players. He and Bobby Doer were close as players because Doerr had the patience of a saint and was one of the few who could defuse William\u2019s constant contentiousness. Williams respected Doerr and would not swear in front of Doerr, something Williams did for no one else, evidently.Third, for decades Johnny Pesky was blamed for the Sox losing the 1946 World Series to the Cardinals. Pesky is thought to have allowed Enos Slaughter to advance from first base to score the winning run in the bottom of the eighth of game 7 by holding the relay throw from centerfield for too long before throwing home. The TEAMMATES suggests that it was not Pesky\u2019s fault.In the bottom of the eighth, Leon Culberson, who had pinch run for a hobbled DiMaggio in the top of the inning, took over centerfield. Slaughter was on first base when Harry Walker hit a line drive to the wall in center. Culberson was not positioned properly and was slow to retrieve the ball. His relay to Pesky at shortstop was late. Pesky had his back to the runners and was unaware that Slaughter did not slow down rounding third and was headed home. Doerr and others tried to yell to Pesky, but the crowd was too loud. Pesky reacted quickly after he turned and saw Slaughter, but by then it was already too late to prevent the run from scoring. The friends\u2019 account of the play, as reported by Halberstam, exonerates Pesky.Fourth, Dom DiMaggio was universally respected for his great intelligence on and off the baseball field. He was an all-star centerfielder in the American League several times and was said never to have made a mistake while playing for the Red Sox. After his retirement from baseball, he started a company that manufactured materials used in automobile interiors and became wealthy, unlike his more famous brother, Joe. Their father, by the way, was an immigrant from Sicily. He supported his large family by working on a commercial fishing boat that operated out of San Francisco.Fifth, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams did not like each other. But Dom and Ted were good friends and became especially close later in life. Dom called Ted every day in the final months before Williams diedThere is more, of course. Read it and discover what for yourself. Any baseball fan will enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Lance", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8511956-lance", "userReview": "Rating: 5 of 5 stars (outstanding)Review:Inspired by a trip in 2002 by former Red Sox teammates Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky to visit their old teammate and friend Ted Williams, award winning author David Halberstam recounts these three teammates along with fellow Red Sox great Bobby Doerr as they maintained friendships well beyond their baseball playing days. Halberstam displays his talents that won him a Pulitizer Prize as he takes each man\u2019s stories and weaves them together in a collection that is at times inspiring, melancholy, uplifting and even humorous. The reader will learn a lot about each man that wasn\u2019t necessarily written by the sportswriters of the time when they were teammates on the Boston Red Sox. Characteristics like Williams\u2019 distance from his children, Doerr\u2019s devotion to his wife Monica (he is unable to make the trip from Oregon because he is caring for her), Pesky\u2019s willingness to be the \u201cgoat\u201d of the famous 1946 World Series play in which Enos Slaughter raced home from first on a base hit that was scored as a single, and DiMaggio\u2019s emergence as a player that stood on his own merit and not just that of his famous brother. There is plenty of baseball in the book as well. The best of these passages is Pesky\u2019s recollection of the play in which Slaughter scored the winning run of game 6. It is a very interesting take on the play, as it differs significantly than what is typically written. Without giving away Pesky\u2019s story, let\u2019s just say that there were other events that took place or were embellished over time to give the play the romantic feel-good flavor it has today.While all four men have excellent stories and passages, I was moved by Halberstam\u2019s writing about Doerr. Everything about the man, from the wooing and courtship of his wife to his playing career and his life after baseball is captured in a manner that shows the tenderness and lack of selfishness that makes up the character of Bobby Doerr. His story is one that will stick with the reader for a long time after closing the book.Halberstam has written several baseball books that have received well-deserved praise and \u201cThe Teammates\u201d is one of them. This is a must-read for any baseball fan, young or old, who enjoys stories that show the human side of the players. Did I skim?No. Pace of the book: The book is fairly short but reads very quickly as Halberstam gets each man to open up and reveal some very personal stories that they did not share with newspaper writers during their playing days. Do I recommend? Anyone who is inspired by accounts of friendship that has endured over many years, whether baseball fans or not, will be touched by this book. I highly recommend for readers of baseball books, biographies or inspirational stories."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/817015-tom", "userReview": "Remember that scene in the movie \"Twins\" when Danny Devito finds out that he was born out of the excess cells used to create uber-man Arnold Schwarzenegger? \"I'm genetic crap,\" Devito's pint-sized character laments.Teammates: A Portrait of Friendship  is not by any means crap. But, from almost start to finish, I was struck by the distinct impression that the bulk of the story was not, in fact, Halberstam's original research based on his interest in Dom DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky's car-trip to visit a dying Ted Williams. The story, the characters, and most obviously, the random selection of baseball history into which Halberstam goes into elaborate detail all seem very obviously like they were gems of information left over from Halberstam's Summer of 49. The excess research, the stories that didn't quite cut it in Summer of 49, seem to form the bulk of Teammates. Thats not necessarily a bad thing. But, during random and very detailed wanderings through the weeds of 1940s big league rosters, I often asked \"Why is Mr. Halberstam taking me here?\"The answer, I believe, is that he had a TON of great anecdotes and baseball lore that he hadn't been able to squeeze into his previous works. So he used the excuse of the previously mentioned car trip to unload his leftovers upon us.It wasn't an entirely misquided effort.

I'm not a big baseball fan, but I really enjoyed getting to know the characters in this book and seeing the journey of grand sports performance, enduring friendships, and the trials of aging. I really enjoyed the detailed sports description of the big loss in 1946 of the Boston Red Sox against the Cardinals which kept the Red Sox from progressing to the World Series. At first I wasn't sure I would like the book and my immediate impression was that it didn't live up to the praise included on the book's back jacket (which I still think even though it was a very good book). The writing really reeled me in in the description of Ted Williams as a person and the loyal friendships he made in spite of having a volatile personality. I felt it was a sort of life lesson of the inherent value of individuals that makes us all worth loving in spite of our weaknesses and \"baggage\".The dialog between Ted and his friend Dom as Ted is suffering and dying is very dear...

Considered by many to be the best hitter of all time, Williams was widely thought of as a temperamental and unstable personality. However, that does not mean that he did not make friends on the Boston Red Sox. Three of his closest friends were Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky and Bobby Doerr. Hearing of their friend\u2019s imminent demise, DiMaggio and Pesky travel over 1,000 miles by car to visit Williams. The serious illness of Doerr\u2019s wife prevents him from going.  This is a story of the old days of baseball when players stayed together on a team for years and formed bonds that lasted for decades. It is also a look into the lives of these players, specifically the temperamental Williams. He was a perfectionist, yet he loved baseball and lived the science of hitting. Williams was also stormy, dominating conversations and situations, yet his friends could tolerate him, and he respected them.  Due to the trip and Halberstam\u2019s account of the events, the reader is given a glimpse into what could have been a team even better than the Yankees. If their top pitchers had not developed serious arm trouble that could be treated by modern medicines, the best team of the late forties and early fifties would have been the Boston Red Sox.  People that know the history of baseball know that the Boston Red Sox were the last major league team to integrate when they hired Pumpsie Green in 1959. The most fascinating fact in this book is that if the Red Sox had not been such a racist organization, they could have signed Willie Mays. If they had, their outfield in the fifties would have contained Ted Williams and Willie Mays. Furthermore, Mays would have played half of his games in Fenway with the short distance to the left field wall. His offensive statistics could have been incredible with that feature and with Williams with him in the lineup.  This is a baseball book that highlights good aspects of four sports heroes. While they were humans with flaws, they were friends, and nothing changed that until they began to die off. While baseball is now a multi-media production, from this book it is clear that in many ways it was better when these men played it."}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81232236-k", "userReview": "This is a fluffy book, but it kind of gets your attention anyway if you're a deep baseball fan. It is a remarkable story, even if the hook to get you into it is very hokey.The story is that the Boston Red Sox of the early 1940s and then for several years after World War II had four great players at the same time who remained lifelong friends. One of the players was Ted Williams, one of the game's half-dozen greatest hitters, and another was Bobby Doerr another Hall of Fame player. The others were consistent stars -- Dom DiMaggio, a 7-time All Star, and Johnny Pesky, one of the best lead-off men of his era. Together, they carried the Sox through a golden era that included a World Series loss and a couple of down-to-the-wire pennant races.The book mentions some on-field exploits and pivotal games. But it's mostly about how the four men got to the majors and how they behaved off the field and with each other. There's undoubtedly some air-brushing, as Pesky, Doerr and DiMaggio are each portrayed as the absolute nicest person there ever was -- humble, generous, loyal to their wives and friends, perfect teammates, and so on. Williams -- who by all reports was a jerk to everyone -- is given a rougher treatment, but with the commentary that he had a rough upbringing and was a perfectionist, so you just had to take him as he was. I certainly wouldn't have taken him for more than about 10 minutes.I understand that baseball in the 1940s and 1950s was a different era. Players weren't walled off from fans, and they had confidence and pride, but not necessarily outsized egos. And these guys went through World War II, really went through it in a couple of cases in combat. But even so, this is over the top in its praise of these men, a hero worship that you don't see in print from a serious writer these days.Still, for anyone who wants to learn about an era and a great team that didn't quite get to the top, this is the book. It's a gentle romp through the locker room or train ride or long car ride down memory lane."}, {"userName": "Greg Enloe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13173219-greg-enloe", "userReview": "Another good Halberstam read.

A Pulitzer Prize-winner for his ground-breaking reporting on the Vietnam War, Halberstam wrote more than 20 books, almost all of them bestsellers. His work has stood the test of time and has become the standard by which all journalists measure themselves.The Teammates is the profoundly moving story of four great baseball players who have made the passage from sports icons--when they were young and seemingly indestructible--to men dealing with the vulnerabilities of growing older. At the core of the book is the friendship of these four very different men--Boston Red Sox teammates Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Ted Williams--who remained close for more than sixty years.The book starts out in early October 2001, when Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky begin a 1,300-mile trip by car to visit their beloved friend Ted Williams, whom they know is dying. Bobby Doerr, the fourth member of this close group--\"my guys,\" Williams used to call them--is unable to join them.This is a book--filled with historical details and first-hand accounts--about baseball and about something more: the richness of friendship.", "title": "The Teammates: A Portrait of a Friendship", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75410.The_Teammates", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421008812l/75410.jpg", "reviews": 251, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/42850.David_Halberstam", "name": "David Halberstam"}], "type": ["Sports and Games", "Sports", "Nonfiction", "History", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75410.The_Teammates", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9592197-the-teammates", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/586605.The_Teammates", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75406.The_Breaks_of_the_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/414062.The_Best_and_the_Brightest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75411.Summer_of_49", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/448135.The_Coldest_Winter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75408.Playing_for_Keeps"]}
