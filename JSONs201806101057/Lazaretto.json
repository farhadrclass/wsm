Relations between blacks and whites were still fraught with mistrust and anger, anger that sometimes boiled over. Many also thought that orphans were throwaway children. All these things would come to a head at the Lazaretto, the first quarantine hospital built in the United States.Wonderful descriptive prose, vibrant and likable characters, well for the most part, we have to have a few bad guys. . Just loved Linc and Bram, Meda, Sylvia, Carl and Dakota and a few more. Very easy story to get into, the setting and the tone places the reader firmly in this time period. If at times it was a bit dramatic that was okay and while the ending may seem a little too pat for some, I thought is was fitting and well deserved.Loved the historical feeling in this one, the small accurate details, but it very much a character driven story and the characters had amazing depth. Will be seeking out more from this author.ARC from Harper Publishing."}, {"userName": "Nakia", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3307717-nakia", "userReview": "Loved every bit of this book.

It is the place where people's paths cross in a ways that change there lives but it was the first half that held for me the real basis of what the book is about. This is when the author pulled me into the lives of this cast of characters that are so appealing that you just have to know what will happen to them . They are loving and kind women caring for children who are not theirs but loving them as if they were, two orphan boys who love their brother who is not really their brother but loving him as if he were . It also depicts a time in our society after slavery where racial boundaries abound. Two young women meet - one pregnant by her boss and the other learning to deliver babies, delivers her first. Both of their lives impacted from that day forward , as is depicted in alternating narratives . This is a beautifully written story that from the start kept me hoping for the day their paths would cross again. Meda, the young mother, who tries to find solace and meaning in her life after losing her baby opens her heart to two infant white boys at the orphanage, Linc and Bram. Yes , named after Abraham Lincoln , who is assassinated on the day she gave birth. Sylvia, the medical assistant , becoming a nurse but also care taker to a baby girl, brought into her life by her uncle who cannot take care of her . It isn't their paths that cross but the culmination of a reunion of sorts is painfully and beautifully rendered at Lazaretto. Predictable revelations and ending but still worthy of four solid stars .Thanks to Harper Collins and Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50923463-emily", "userReview": "So apparently my love for civil war-era novels is not all-encompassing, because even though this book seemed right up my alley I could not get engaged. The author seemed distracted by her own plot lines, jumping from character to character and glossing over months, sometimes years of developments with a single exposition-heavy paragraph. None of their characters ever seemed developed, and their actions were never justified or explored for this reason (see: Meda's relationship with Ann, a relationship that could be a book in itself but is explained away in a few sentences and barely returned to - seriously, a lesbian romance between a black and white woman in the post-civil war north and you don't want to explore the implications of that even a little??) I saw the ending coming from a mile away, and the \"twist\" was eye roll-worthy.

At the start of the story, a young black woman named Meda is toiling to give birth. The midwife's assistant Sylvia is shocked when the baby's father, takes the baby away and orders her to tell Meda the was stillborn. The secret will haunt Sylvia for the rest of her life. As a means to ease her grief, Meda bonds with two boys, Linc and Bram who reside at a nearby orphanage.Told through these women's points of view, I was treated to a lush story of dark secrets, hardship, and abounding love. The larger than life characters drew me into the story, each adding a different aspect to this multi-layered story. Lovely prose, wonderfully vivid descriptions, and a darn good yarn made me flip the pages at a furious pace. A definite 5 star read!

I didn't love that occasionally she'd do that at a dramatic point when the tension was high and I needed to know what happened next, but that's not the kind of book this is. The plot was saved from potential melodrama by the quiet way she let it play out, stopping here and there to check in on the activity in the kitchen or have two friends tease each other.

There were a LOT of characters in this book. The second half of the book, I had a hard time keeping them all straight. There was a huge gap in time between the two; Bram and Linc were both babies, toddlers, and adolescents in the first half, the second half they are grown men trying to find their way. However, the heart of the story is a doozy, and one that I had never heard of. It explores the love between brothers, between mother and son, romantic loves, and love between friends.

(this is one example of a loose thread that was just left hanging or abruptly moved along from.) the ending was a bit clunky, though i had been wholly sucked in during the first half of the novel. but, there was much i liked in the book, and mckinney-whetstone created some very vivid moments."}, {"userName": "Meagan", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/270740-meagan", "userReview": "Well. Wow. There was a lot about this book I didn't anticipate. The tone can be a bit challenging for a reader like me - there's a lot of hardship and injustice and tragedy. I can't lie. I found that rough going. There were things that kept my optimistic side happy and kept me reading, like Meda's love for Bram and Linc, or the friendship between Sylvia and Nevada, although so many rugs got pulled out from under me that it was hard to trust any of the nice things. But the world and the community felt real, and that's super important to me in historical fiction. Challenging as it was, I also thought it was a really good piece of fiction.That ending though. I'm not going to say anything about it. Just, you know. That ending!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie Stennett", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13985912-stephanie-stennett", "userReview": "This could have been a four star book. Maybe should have been. What it lacked was a good editor. Parts needed tightening. Other parts should have been expanded, or fleshed out. But publishers can't be bothered anymore. Sad. (And don't get me started on the copy editing errors. Appalling!)Sadly I never got really attached to most of the characters, except maybe Sylvia, who chooses medicine over domestic entanglement. Sylvia deserves her own sequel. I'd love to read it. I also think McKinney-Whetstone should write a novel about the yellow fever epidemic in Phil 1790s. If I remember correctly, the black Society of Friends were about the only people who stayed and nursed the sick and dying. That could be a real heart-breaker."}, {"userName": "Andre", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5321728-andre", "userReview": "3.5 for the pacing and prose. Although the cast of characters are plentiful, she manages to craft a good tale with some real life elements. The major drawback in this novel was the suspense and tension she built into the story was telegraphed and easy to discern which distracted from the overall story, because you know the mysteries early on. So instead of staying engaged with that anxious anticipation and being surprised about some detail, you end up reading to see when and how the \"secrets\" will be revealed. That is not necessarily a bad thing, because the goal is to keep the reader involved, and this she accomplishes. Overall an enjoyable read when all the pages are turned."}, {"userName": "Michael Bell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35666554-michael-bell", "userReview": "This is one of my favorite authors. Her sense of time and place is second to none. the death of Abraham Lincoln is a cause for mourning in Philadelphia during the period of this book. A midwife delivers a child that was supposed to be aborted. The young assistant makes a choice that shapes the novel immensely. There is not too much brutality towards Blacks thankfully but an incident does mar a celebration. I thought Vergie was the answer.

Diane McKinney-Whetstone has been blessed with the phenomenal ability to keep her reader interested throughout. I honestly did not want to put the book down. A Philadelphia transplant from Savannah, I am very familiar with the Lazaretto facility in what is now Essington, PA, just outside of Southwest Philly, in Delaware County. The site has since been transformed into a tourist site with a nearby ballroom given the same name. Before there was Ellis Island, there was the Lazaretto, a quarantine station established in 1799 to examine incoming immigrants to the city of Philadelphia. Any sick passengers or crew members would be quarantined there.Diane gives us vibrant chararcters who feel more like family and friends than those from historical fiction. All of the emotions (laughter, shock, curiosity, tears, etc) will come forth while reading this novel. Lazaretto tells the story of love, family, unity, genuine togetherness, social class, and racial identity among the African-American community in South Philadelphia. Lazaretto deals with issues such as passing (both knowing and unknowingly), pathological medical conditions, rape, gambling, colorism, and drug addiction to name a few. The novel speaks to the strength and character of the women, who against the odds, held everything together. Though we like to think of novels as having one or two main characters, Diane gives us many main characters whose lives, stories, and histories are intrinsically intertwined. There are at least eight different, but connected stories throughout the book. However, the story of Linc and Bram will capture your heart. Throughout the novel, there is no greater love than the love between these two brothers. They fight, sacrifice and look out for one another to no end. Theirs is a true bond of unbreakable love, friendship, and brotherhood. The stories of Meda, The Benins, Buddy, Miss Ma, Nevada, Sylvia, Carl, Ann, Dr. Miss and the no count Lazaretto physician all serve as a backdrop to help tell the story of Linc and Bram. Each of the other stories gently touch on a current 21st century issue.The simultaneous death of Abraham Lincoln and the birth of a newborn lays the foundation of what plays out during this story. In this well laid out story of a woman and two babies, we find that love, truth, and understanding prevail. This 336 page novel is well worth the read as it is beautifully written."}, {"userName": "Michelle Leonard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105072-michelle-leonard", "userReview": "I've been a fan of Diane McKinney-Whetstone for years (no relation that I'm aware of).

McKinney presents a tangle of characters and events in tumultuous post-Civil war society. It is an interesting story: a young midwife-in-training delivers her first baby in an unwelcome world. The child is immediately whisked away for better or worse, and the mother, a servant in a wealthy household, is paralyzed by grief. What follows is a drawn-out tale that explores the parallel lives of two children.

The Lazaretto\u2019s black live-in staff forge a strong social community, and when one of them receives permission to get married on the island the mood is one of celebration, particularly since the white staff\u2014save the opium-addicted doctor\u2014are given leave for the weekend. On the eve of the ceremony, a gunshot rings out across the river. A white man has fired at a boat carrying the couple\u2019s friends and family to the island, and the captain is injured. His life lies in the hands of Sylvia, the Lazaretto\u2019s head nurse, who is shocked to realize she knows the patient. Intertwined with the drama unfolding at the Lazaretto are the fates of orphan brothers. When one brother commits a crime to protect the other, he imperils both of their lives\u2014and the consequences ultimately deliver both of them to the Lazaretto.In this masterful work of historical fiction, Diane McKinney-Whetstone seamlessly transports us to Philadelphia in the aftermath of the Civil War and Lincoln\u2019s assassination, beautifully evoking powerful stories of love, friendship and humanity amid the vibrant black community that flourished amid the troubled times.", "title": "Lazaretto", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18090010-lazaretto", "average": 3.72, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442251412l/18090010.jpg", "reviews": 125, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/235942.Diane_McKinney_Whetstone", "name": "Diane McKinney-Whetstone"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18090010-lazaretto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18052887-lazaretto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28172987-lazaretto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/429931.Tumbling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/417814.Tempest_Rising", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/429929.Blues_Dancing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/429927.Leaving_Cecil_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2067981.Trading_Dreams_at_Midnight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
