Savannah makes you feel as if you are there with the family as she details her life journey that started at age 13. As they make the harrowing journey to the Russian border and finally after months of horrid conditions on trains they finally have clean beds when they change trains in Russia. They go to a beautiful lake and run into a Russian couple walking toward them and the girl is beautiful and naked(?)--Savannah's brother is having a heart attack!! The first stop they are able to take warm showers and wash their hair. On this portion of the trip they stay in a Yuk, ride horses across the plains and her brother falls in love!! During this adventure they also spend a long time traveling to destinations that appear very boring (Communism era towns)but give them the feel of what it was like to live under Communism. They met many travelers from other countries and spend time with them going to places they shouldn't--guess what happens when they get caught!! If you have ever thought about going to Tibet or watch the sunrise over Mt Everest in Nepal you really need to read this book. You will find yourself wondering how they ever managed to see so much and do so much and get out alive. By the way--Savannah may have grown her boobs in China but she had her first real crush in this book. The book draws you into every day lives of the people in the countries they travel thru and makes you want to head out on a trip following in their footsteps. Enjoy the second book, I know I did, and I can't wait for the next installment--what happens--how does Savannah complete her education when she was taken out of school at 13. What is her mother, her sister, her brother doing now? We are impatiently waiting, Savannah!!(less)"}, {"userName": "Jessica Lipowski", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31618876-jessica-lipowski", "userReview": "Once again, and to no surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed Savannah\u2019s second memoir. \u201cBackpacks and Bra Straps,\u201d the second book in the Sihpromatum series, shares honest, raw emotion, everything from inner angst to family conflict and breathless moments (literally) to laughing hysterically. Through her beautiful and descriptive words, the author takes you along for the ride. I could easily imagine the sights, sounds and smells along the way. She weaves in travel and historical facts, too.I remember when I finished \u201cI Grew My Boobs in China,\u201d I couldn\u2019t wait for the next book. I desperately wanted to experience more. Now, after finishing \u201cBackpacks and Bra Straps,\u201d I have exactly the same feeling. I want to find out where the family ends up next. Plus, it left me wanting to hit the road. I love watching Savannah grow up and mature as she travels the world. I\u2019m certainly ready for \u201cRusty Tracks and Booby Traps,\u201d the third book in the series (still to be released).Sihpromatum is one series you will definitely not want to miss.

Whereas the first book primarily focused on young Savannah's emotions and experiences, this one gives us a broader range, and written from a more experienced and mature point of view the story flows even better yet is still ripe with Savannah's ever present charm and personality. The humour in this book is honest and revealing and laugh out loud funny at times. I enjoyed listening to her tell, in her own words, about the many experiences she and her family had--including some trying times that made them all weary and exhausted. One thing is for sure, Savannah was made for adventure and her indomitable spirit will keep her on the move and hopefully be bringing us more books in the future. If you have not met Savannah Grace yet, you should do so, and if you have not read her books yet, what are you waiting for? They may just prompt you to live on the edge and seek out your own adventures. This review is based on a complimentary copy from the author in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Grace is only 23 years old and has the class and the style of a seasoned performer in the manner in which she treats a maximally dysfunctional family story into one of the most tender and warm and wise (and hilarious), for the lack a better term, memoirs that absorbs all the angst of family dissolution post divorce, unfathomable adventure on an aimless backpacking trip through Asia and Mongolia that our author turns into a positive experience.The language of the book reveals an informative and fascinating report about her family's wandering habits and in this second volume she continues her march toward adulthood through Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, through Western China and Tibet, and finally, to watch the sun rise over Mount Everest in Nepal. Savannah's initial reluctance to travel and the personal growth she documents distinguishes this raw tale from most travel memoirs. She knows well how to keep the humor rolling without negating the psychological and physiological changes that she undergoes. The mixture f cultural observations and influences with family dysfunction and coping are served up as well (if not better!) than volume 1 with that memorable title I GREW MY BOOBS IN CHINA.What happens during this extended journey into rarely trod adventures in the designated countries offers more insight into what becoming an individual and an adult means on the most basic level. Her version of the odyssey is an honest, rich accounting of encountering unique and endearing personalities, places, realizations, and an exploration of the world and life we all will envy. It is refreshing to discover a new writer who at this young age has gained an emotional maturity and a polished writing style and gratefully proves that the public has won - now that there is volume 2 BACKPACKS AND BRA STRAPS with hopefully promises of more to come. This is a terrific book to enjoy on your own and then share with young people around you to give that ray of light to illuminate the possibilities of turning a potential curse into a blessing."}, {"userName": "Rosie Amber", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12118203-rosie-amber", "userReview": "Backpacks and Bra Straps is the second book following Savannah and her family as they spend a year Backpacking. They are a family group; Mum, older brother Ammon (a seasoned traveller), 18 year old Bree and 15 year old Savannah. They started their journey in China and the first book \"I Grew My Boobs In China\" tells of the way they adapted to the people and the cultures of the countries they began to travel through. Not on any big tourist trails, they have a small daily budget and travel on buses and trains as the locals do.This second book has them crossing in to Russia with a 7 hour delay whilst the train and all its occupants are searched, making their journey from Mongolia a whacking 37hours. You get up close and personal accounts of their travels going to amazing places like Lake Baikal, the deepest, oldest and cleanest lake in the world. Along the way they meet people who so often go out of their way to help them find accommodation, buy tickets and deal with language barriers. It returns your faith in mankind.Their journey doesn't go without challenges and fears, sometimes the journeys were really dangerous as mad drivers raced on roads up and down mountain sides and crossing border controls was often painstakingly slow with the need to work their way around officialdom on a number of occasions.What is great about these books, is meeting the real people and seeing places that few others experience because of the way the have chosen to travel. Living in close proximity does have it's own challenges which they learn to overcome, and the life lessons that Savannah has more than makes up for being taken out of her Canadian school and leaving her friends thousand of mile away.This part of their journey ends with Bree's friend Steph joining them for a two week hike to base camp mount Everest, a most memorable journey and I felt I travelled with them every step of the way, it meant different things to each of them when they conquered the climb and as they left the area in a helicopter for their next adventure Savannah reflects on her new word \"Sihpromatum\" a curse that turns into a blessing which sums up how she feels about much of this experience.I really do recommend these books to anyone with even a slight interest in travel and the rest of the world."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23873887-linda", "userReview": "I suspected that I would enjoy this sequel more than the first and this proved correct.

The book jumps right into the action as the family reaches Russia by train. There\u2019s a bit of flashback information to get you up to speed, and readers who skipped the first book (dealing with China and Mongolia) will find chapter 5\u2019s discussion of where they\u2019ve been interesting. After Russia they stop briefly in Khazahkstan and Kyrgyzstan, then cross back into China and trough it to Tibet and Nepal. The book ends with their trek to the top of Kala Patthar, 263 meters above the Mount Everest base campThe book is full of fascinating cultural observations and travel details (mostly via her brother Ammon\u2019s guidebook lectures). It\u2019s interesting to read how different things are handled in different parts of the world. The long wait times and even longer bus rides show the challenges of this type of travel even as Savannah points out the benefits of seeing things as a native and meeting new people.As the trip wears on tempers wear thin and the last third of the book involves a lot of family drama. It\u2019s interesting, though probably more detailed than I needed.The descriptions remain vivid and really make you want to book your own trip to these places (well, some of these places). The book is quick paced and the writing smooth.I beta read the manuscript and so didn\u2019t see the photos that accompany the text.If you like travelogues and/or biographies, this one is worth the read."}, {"userName": "Amber Leigh", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10013995-amber-leigh", "userReview": "I was so happy when this book was released, I had been waiting quite awhile since the first one. This book was amazing and I couldn't put it down. This book is quite different from the first as you can see how everyone in the group has grown so much in the months they have been traveling. It was one of the most honest travel memoirs I have ever read and I loved it. I read the first book when I was living abroad and it was great to understand those first moments of travel and now I have read the second book after a few more trips and Savannah really puts moments of travel into words just beautifully! The author creates amazing descriptions of situations and places that would be almost impossible to explain and takes the reader on the adventure with the family. There are some moments in the book where I actually laughed and others where I couldn't stop reading until late in the night. During the climb of Mount Everest, I couldn't stop reading, it showed all the internal and external struggles of climbing the famous mountain.It's a beautifully written book that is able to capture all the beautiful, funny and horrible moments of travel. It is also very well written on her experience and how she was growing as a person. I learned a lot about countries I have only dreamed about seeing and it was great to see how much there is to see in those countries that many people don't visit, I think it was wonderful to see some light shed on these countries and open peoples minds to the area.

You def should read them in order although there are lots of references to the first book in this one as well.What really put me off in a big way from this book was the chapter about \"Privacy\". Some of those details were a bit too intimate for me, and since the narrator is 15 years old at the time the events take place I really feel they should not have been included in the book. After reading what I did not wish to read I immediately skipped to the end of the chapter and then seriously considered whether or not I would even finish the book. In the end I did finish the book but found myself skimming more and more. I guess someone told the author that \"intimate details\" sell books or something. I don't know. I guess I am being an old prude but again considering the age of Savannah and her sister Bree I think there were several things that should have been edited out.Beyond that... I liked that there was a map and links to the photos and I was very interested in the adventures and the traveling itself.I'm on the fence as to whether or not I will read book #3 when it comes out though and I won't be recommending this book to anyone."}, {"userName": "amanda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31416927-amanda", "userReview": "Great Memoirs from a Different PerspectiveI read the first book in the series \"I Grew My Boobs in China\" and immediately bought \"Backpacks and Bra Straps\".I've read so many travel memoirs, but what's really unique about about these books is that they're from the perspective of a teenage girl. I did a little bit of traveling myself around the ages of the author in the books, and it's a totally different experience at that age than now as an adult. It's interesting to read about her thoughts and experiences about some of the same places that are written about in other memoirs, but from the mindset of a teenage girl who wasn't given the choice about the trip vs. an adult who (probably) takes the time to save money and plan out the trip of their lifetime. The author really seems to have grown up a lot since the first book. She went from feeling like she was being unfairly dragged around the world to actually appreciating and enjoying the experience.

After reading the first volume, I was thrilled to star this book, and it did not disappoint at all. Savannah Grace does a really nice job of writing about her feelings during the treks, and describing nicely the things she sees during her travels, and her reactions to them. It was also interesting to see the family having fights, and I will be honest, I think that she was justified in her feelings about her pets, and that her mother was unfair to treat her the way she did after Savannah unloaded her feelings about having to give up her pets.I enjoyed the whole book, but I would have to say my favorite was when they are in Nepal, and making their way to Mount Everest. The way that Savannah describes the trip to see the sun rise over Mount Everest was just stunning, and I wish I could have been there with her. I have truly enjoyed this series so far, and I can say in all honesty that I am more than eager to get on to Book 3, and can't wait for it to come out, because I am definitely eager to read more of her adventures, especially in India."}, {"userName": "Ilana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4335525-ilana", "userReview": "After reading the first book, I was very curious about the follow-up.

The writing is even better, with dialogues and many geographical and historical details that might convince you in a couple of pages that it's about time to have your indefinite leave of absence while discovering the world. This volume covers mostly the travel through Russia and some former Russian Republics, a world mostly unknown and out of reach to most European and American audiences.
