Long before, he urged his son Paul never to work in the mines. When death and tragedy occurs, sixteen year old Paul remembers that promise to his father. But how will these two orphans survive? Taking his seven year old sister Jubilee, Paul heads off away from the coal mines to find his mother\u2019s sister Anita and a new life. Sadly, tragedy has not finished with this little family, as Paul when applying for a job is caught up in a robbery. Jubilee who had been told to wait for him on the park bench has no idea what has happened. Who can help her? Enter Ethan Allen, familiar to readers from Spare Change, the first book in the Wyattsville series. Other characters like Olivia Doyle and Detective Jack Mahoney also make a valuable contribution in this book. Of course there are also like Hurt Mc Adams whose life is one of bitterness, anger and hate. How these characters interact makes for a compelling read that had me turning the pages, suffering tears and anger but also smiles along the way. I adored this book. I loved seeing the changes in Ethan Allen and Olivia and seeing the love and trust between Paul and Jubilee. Given complications like memory loss, false information and closed minds, the truth of what happened the day of the robbery takes quite some time to uncover. Meanwhile, there are those who want revenge, or what they see as justice, without knowing all the facts. And what will it mean for Paul and Jubilee?This is Bette Lee Crosby at her best, as she weaves the story thoroughly involving me in all that was happening. I was absorbed from start to finish. 2018 is turning into a good reading year with another five star read."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Sixteen year old Paul Jones and his little sister Jubilee had grown up in a loving home \u2013 their mother Ruth and father Bartholomew doted on them both. But when Ruth died of tuberculosis Bartholomew\u2019s life crumbled; he struggled on but the unwanted life of a miner in West Virginia weighed him down. Making Paul promise he would never follow in his or his grandfather\u2019s footsteps made Bartholomew feel a little easier as he knew Paul would honour his promise \u2013 but the notification one afternoon of the terrible and unexpected death of their father created such a catastrophic change in Paul and Jubilee\u2019s lives that Paul wasn\u2019t sure what to do for the best.The long bus journey to Wyattsville was the beginning of the search for a long lost Aunt \u2013 Paul thought perhaps she could help them. On their arrival Paul saw a shop which had a \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d notice in the window so he told Jubie to wait on the bench seat for him \u2013 he was sure he would have the job, which meant a room to rent and food on the table for them both. The dreadful events of that day changed the course of the two children\u2019s lives \u2013 would Paul and Jubie be safe? And how would Jubilee\u2019s journey end?I loved Jubilee\u2019s Journey, which is the second in the Wyattsville series \u2013 I read the first, Spare Change some time ago and loved it too. The characters are so real, and meeting up with several of the members of Spare Change was like meeting up with friends again. Bette Lee Crosby is an amazing writer and she hasn\u2019t disappointed me yet. I\u2019ll be reading the third in the series, Passing Through Perfect very soon.

The times, the setting, and the characters were all brought to life so well that I was immediately feeling nostalgic for a time before I was even born. There was a fleeting, golden afternoon quality to the words that left me with an appreciation for how life is never all sweet and some times things happen that are out of our control, but we must find a way to live through to the other side.I wasn't sure what to expect and I was a little confused by the early part of the book since it didn't match the blurb, but I soon realized that the author was starting events well before the current time of the story. To be clear, I didn't mind- just confused. What I mean is that the early chapters tell the story of Bartholomew and Ruth, their early lives, becoming a family, and tragedy to the present when Paul and Jubilee, their children, take the fateful journey that sets up the events for the rest of the story. Their story is juxtaposed against another man, Hurt's early story and what put him on an angry, murderous crash course with the two children there in a Wyattsville grocery store. This choice of how to take things back to the earlier years made sense as the story progressed. Paul and Jubilee's story is sad, but they have each other and try to stay hopeful because they have nothing else. Paul is an amazing young man who left school and childhood behind when he was still a young child himself to take care of his sick mother, his sister, and the household while his dad work the mines. Then when both parents were gone, as a teenager and newly evicted from their home, he takes Jubilee and all they have in a backpack to seek out a way to start over. Then, tragedy strikes again and they live under a cloud of injustice as other people work to right the wrong. I was teary-eyed and cheering for this pair of kids, but particularly this amazing young man.I thought this whole story that had a small main cast of people trying to help Jubilee who is first thought to be a lost orphan and not associated with the kid in the hospital who was thought to be part of an armed robbery was captivating. It has a small town, slow paced feel as events march on. The story is part mystery and part fiction following the case of the armed robbery and Jubilee's mysterious past, but also delves into the lives of several key people including Olivia Doyle, her grandson Ethan Allen Doyle, and Detective Jack Mahoney from the previous book.I will add that there are a few times that I felt it lagged a little, but not to the point of boredom. Olivia tends to be a brooder and dithers a little and Detective Gomez was driving me to violence the way he put his career ahead of actually working Paul's case so that went on longer than it should have. Jack Mahoney was the real hero of the story doing the actual police work since Gomez wouldn't. He was up against department jealousies, jurisdictions, biting into his own family time and work, and then even Olivia's shenanigans because she called him in, but barely trusted him with the truth. Olivia got on my nerves how she expected so much from him and used him even calling on his weekends at home, but had her own agenda though I get that it was on Jubilee's behalf.It was interesting to me when it came to the historical aspect of the story. I'm not sure when the story took place. I think it might have been the late 40's early 50's for the parent's story and then the present one was maybe the 60's. There weren't a ton of clues and yet it had the feel of those times. I experienced this story in audio format with the dual narration efforts of Sean Crisden and Amy Melissa Bentley. I've listened to both their work, separately, in the past and loved what they did. However, I didn't think they were a good match for this story. Children's voices, opposite sex, southern drawls were all moderately done well at best. I thought Bentley particularly overdid it with Jubilee and Clara, Olivia's friend, or when there was a highly emotional moment. Criden's characters were many times the same gruff tone if they were male. It wasn't terrible, by any means, but not quite there, either.All in all, it was a lovely, heartwarming story with many facets. I was first introduced to the author's writing through a few highly rated reviews from Kimberly at Caffeinated Book Reviews so when I had the chance to pick up this audio edition of Jubilee's Journey, I jumped on it. I will definitely be going back for more, but particularly Olivia and Ethan Allen's story in the first of this series.My thanks to Tantor Audio for the opportunity to listen to this story in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "\u2615 Kimberly ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082615-kimberly", "userReview": "Told from multiple POV\u2019s we begin our tale with the Jones\u2019, a Virginia mining family. We learn about the parent\u2019s courtship, and the births of Paul and Jubilee. It is a hard life, but we quickly become attached. When tragedy strikes and the children are forced to leave the mining town, young Paul takes his sister to Wyattsville in search of their estranged aunt. Paul spies a \u201cFor Hire\u201d sign in the local market, and asks seven year old Jubilee to wait on a bench directly across the street. He pulls down the sign and enters. At that moment, their lives will be forever altered, as will Olivia and Ethan Allen\u2019s. The tale that unfolds is full of tragedy, warmth, and lessons. Jubilee\u2019s Journey is a beautiful tale of love, innocents, hope and community.Crosby has an unbelievable gift for creating fleshed out, unique and lovable characters. She draws you in exposing their quirks, flaws, gifts and very soul. Olivia referred to as Grandma by Ethan Allen had her life altered when Ethan Allen entered her uncomplicated life. When Jubilee makes an entrance she becomes a fierce mama bear and sets out to help this adorable child. Ethan Allen is rough around the edges, skips school and causes his Grandma grief but underneath it all, he is the sweetest young man and it was wonderful seeing him again. Old characters and friends from the apartment complex make a return and all step up to help. Aunt Anita seemed harsh, but even her tale was fleshed out and had me connecting with her. A young man named Hurt is introduced and I both loathed him and wanted to hold him. Crosby fleshed out even the secondary characters weaving them into the tale and our hearts.Jubilee\u2019s Journey blends several genres together making it a captivating read. It is a tale of growth, hope and inspiration, with a mystery weaved into it as people in Wyattsville move to help this young child and her brother. Set in 1956, Crosby captured the era and transported us back to a simpler time. It reflects on rush to judgment, forgiveness and most of all love. The multiple prospective made the tale engaging. We got inside Olivia\u2019s head and experienced her fears, concerns, hope and love. We also get into Jack Mahoney\u2019s head an officer who goes the extra mile as he works to help Jubilee and her brother. His detective work was fascinating and reminded me of those old dime store PI books. Other character\u2019s share their perspectives, added warmth and furthering the tale. This was such an easy read; I was drawn in from the first page and held captive to the end. It makes you believe in the power of the human spirit and the kindness of strangers.Copy received in exchange for unbiased review and\u200b full review\u200b originally published @ Caffeinated Book Reviewer"}, {"userName": "Maryellen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6023641-maryellen", "userReview": "\" His death came as no surprise to anyone. He was one of the countless men forever lost to the mine. They were men loved and mourned by their families, but to the world they were faceless, nameless people, not worthy of mention in the Charleston Times.\"\nAnd so it begins, \nJUBILEE'S JOURNEY\n. For it was Jubilee Jones's father, Bartholomew Jones, who died that day in the mine leaving seven year old Jubilee and her sixteen year old brother Paul, alone in the world. The life of a coal miner has never been an easy one. Fraught with uncertainty and the seemingly never-ending debt to \"The Company\", Bartholomew Jones did his best to provide for his children. In the end, the coal company would ask the children to leave the \"Company house\", the only home that either of them had ever known. Ever since Jubilee was a baby, Paul has been taking care of her. He made a promise that he'd always take care of his little sister. With no place else to go and only the small backpack containing everything they own in the world, the children board a bus and travel to Wyattsville, VA in search of their only living relative, Aunt Anita. They have never known their Aunt Anita as she and the children's mother had been estranged for years.Almost as soon as these children make it to Wyattsville, Paul and Jubilee become separated. Paul is in the wrong place at the wrong time during an armed robbery. As Jubilee waits hours for Paul to return, she meets twelve year old Ethan Allen, a precocious young man who lives with his Grandma Olivia. With no sign of Paul, Ethan Allen, convinces a scared and alone Jubilee to come to his Grandmother's apartment at the Wyattsville Arms Building. A building where one child is scarcely being tolerated, let alone two.Bette Lee Crosby grabs you from the very first paragraph of this book taking you to the heart of Appalachia's coal mines. And then she takes your heart and wraps it around the tiny little finger of Jubilee Jones. Though this book is the second in The Wyattsville Series, it can also be read as a standalone. Fair warning though, once I read \nJUBILEE'S JOURNEY\n it was quite clear that I wanted to know more about Ethan Allen and his Grandma Olivia, both of whom were introduced in the first book of \"The Wyattsville Series\" called \nSPARE CHANGE\n.\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730\u2730 More if I could award them.A copy of this book was given to me by the author.

Mrs. Crosby swept me away again into the town of Wyattsville, where Olivia and Ethan Allen reside from her wonderful book Spare Change. The journey does not start there however. Jubilee and her brother Paul start their journey in a small coal mining town called Coal Fork, West Va. (there really is such a town, I looked it up). Their beautiful mama Ruthie died of a fever one year and their dad died a few years later in the coal mine from an accident. Seven year old Jubilee and her sixteen year old brother Paul set out to find their mama\u2019s sister or if they cannot, for Paul to earn his way in the world and take care of his young sister. They don\u2019t have their aunt\u2019s address, just Wyattsville, Va on some old letters found in mama\u2019s Bible. The tone of the letters is not friendly and Paul is not encouraged.

It's a story that you are drawn into with the first few pages and keeps you entwined in Jubilee's life. Starting out in a coal mining town gives you insight as to how hard these men worked, how little they had and how they wanted better futures for their children. But, that, at times, is very hard to achieve.Your heart is torn at the loss of a Mother, at the wisdom of a young child taking on the work and stress of an adult. The story line works it's way from W.VA. to the Bay and beyond, all the while, attempting to find a home, someone to love them, care for them. Your heart will ache with all that they go through.

Jubilee and her big brother Paul's story was great all by itself, but then our friends from Spare Change, Ethan Allen, Olivia, Clara and others are in Wyattsville.It's a beautiful story, sad and tragic at times; with a murder, misunderstanding, mystery.

Paul, at sixteen, has seen far too much grief and hardship in his short life. His mother fell ill when he was eight, forcing Paul to take over the care of his sister and the house. When she died a couple of years later, Paul continued to care for Jubilee. Then at sixteen, another devastating blow. Their father is killed in the mines. Paul puts his best foot forward, believing he can still take care of his sister. When the man from the mine informs them that they must leave the house as it is the property of the mine or Paul must work in the mine, a decision must be made. Paul promised his father he would never set foot in the mine, but where are they to go? Paul finds a few letters from his mother's sister, Aunt Anita. He and seven year old Jubilee sett out for Wyattsville. Unfortunately on their first afternoon there, tragedy strikes. Paul is shot, an innocent victim of a robbery. Jubilee is waiting and waiting on the bench, not knowing Paul's fate. Luckily, a plucky boy, Ethan Allen, knows a thing or two about being lost and alone and comes to her aid. Can Ethan Allen and the citizens of Wyattsville help a pair of down on their luck orphans?What I Liked:*Ms. Crosby has gift for sculpting out believable characters with plenty of flaws and likable qualities. She knows how to make them human by exposing their shortcomings and triumphs. Some feel like old friends after awhile. I always enjoy Ms. Crosby's characters, and I highly recommend checking out her books if you are someone who enjoys great character driven stories. *I enjoyed seeing many of my favorite characters from Spare Change again. The lovable, rascal Ethan Allen returns, and this time, he plays the role of a surrogate big brother to the lost Jubilee. I adore Ethan Allen. At eleven he is a typical boy who would rather play than go to school. His grammar often needs correcting, he is quick to scheme, but most of all he is big hearted and willing to help someone who was once like him. Grandma Olivia is back, and she finds herself again taking in a straggler orphan. This time, though, Olivia is fast to act and she quickly opens her heart to another lost child. All of Olivia's wonderful friends from the apartment are there to help her out as well. Detective Jack Mahoney returns, and he his soon drawn into another case that doesn't look right on the outside. His determined digging uncovers the truth and saves two lives. *Aside from the return of some beloved characters, there are some new introductions such as Paul and Jubilee. Paul is the most kindhearted, brave and caring sixteen year old. He continues to do the right thing and move forward despite all the hardship he has faced. Jubilee is a plucky seven year old who needs a little love. I throughly enjoyed getting to know these two lovable orphans along with some of the new secondary characters. *Once again, Ms. Crosby presents a story filled with hardship, sorrow, greed, and then blends it with kindness, love and hope. She shows us the ugly side of humanity and then shoots a ray of sunshine in as we see the kindness of strangers doing the right thing. From the women at the bus station, to the kind waitress at the cafe, as well as Olivia, Ethan Allen and all their friends. Some characters, at first, are bitter, unkind and unlikable, but I was pleasantly surprised to find by the end, I changed my mind about Detective Gomez, Carmella and Aunt Anita. I liked seeing them do the right thing, and I liked seeing that unexpected spark of goodness.*At the heart of the book is an interesting little mystery. The reader is in on the full story from the get go, but it was still enjoyable to watch the main players put together the pieces and uncover the truth behind the robbery and shooting. There are plenty of obstacles to overcome before the real story emerges. I liked that there was a bit of suspense thrown in. *This is a book that can be picked up and read without having read the first book. It is a stand alone story that ties in nicely with Spare Change. It feels more like a companion novel than a sequel. *Finally, I appreciated that everything reaches a heartfelt, satisfactory conclusion. This is a read that will leave you with hope and a smile, perfect for a dreary, stormy winter day or anytime you need a positive, pick me up read. And The Not So Much:*As with Spare Change, this story is told with multiple view points. There are numerous switches as each chapter is from a different perspective. I know many readers are not fond of books with many voices, but this is easy to follow as each character's chapter is clearly labeled and it isn't hard to keep track of who is narrating. *I wasn't a fan of the villain, Hurt, his chapters were jarring and unpleasant. However, I appreciated that I had insight into his motives and behavior. His part ends dramatically, but I kind of felt like there should have been a bit more. After all that, I didn't feel like there was closure. The folks in Wyattsville weren't even aware of his fate. A minor loose end.*I wanted to know a bit more about Aunt Anita. Did she get her life back on track and end up in a better place? Did she end up having a positive relationship with her niece and nephew? What about her ex husband?Even though it was nice being in on the mystery, part of me thinks it might have been better to have been left in the dark, trying to piece everything together along with Detective Mahoney. This is not an issue at all, just a thought. Jubilee's Journey is a heart warming, emotional tale that relates the hardship, sadness and suffering of two orphans who through the kindness of strangers find love, happiness and a home. If are in need of a pleasant, pick me up book with plenty of exceptional characters and a terrific story, grab this one. It is the perfect book for those long, winter days.Favorite Quotations:\"Sisters don't weigh their words with each other; that's just how it is.

You feel when you look at them.I fell in love with Ethan Allen in Spare Change and was thrilled to return to Wyattsville and have his story continue in Jubilee\u2019s Journey.He is doing fine. That is until one day, he stops at a crime scene, doing a lookie-loo to see what was going down. Sent on his way, as he pedals off he spies a little girl sitting all alone on a bench, looking so sad and lost.I just knew Ethan would mull about that girl. So when he\u2019s riding his bike home from school it\u2019s no surprise when he stops to help the girl still sitting there on a bench. He convinces her to come home with him. His grandmother will take care of her.Poor Olivia. Ethan brings home a stray. First thing she does is feed her. Then gently, she pries her story from her.She\u2019s Jubilee, 7 years old, and she came to the city with her brother after their father died. Paul was determined to keep his promise to their father and they get off the bus in Wyattsville searching for their aunt. All they have is her first name.Paul told Jubilee to wait on the bench while he went inside to check out a job. Hours later, he still hadn\u2019t returned and that\u2019s when Ethan came into the picture.I felt such anguish for Jubilee. She depended on her older brother, trusted him to take care of them, and now he was just gone. She\u2019s such a sweetie. So innocent yet so firm in her love for her brother.Paul is such a mature young man, and such a good brother to Jubilee. When he entered that store, he had no idea his path would converge with Hurt McAdams and he would find himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and wouldn\u2019t be leaving the way he went in.Ethan is still Ethan. Always pushing the limit, and working his grandmother, Olivia. She\u2019s wise to his ways but knows sometimes it\u2019s best to let him think he\u2019s got one over on her.Ethan and Jubilee become very close with Ethan filling the role of big brother and protector until her real brother returns.I\u2019m not sure if you could label one genre for this book. Bette blends several into her story. I call it life literature.

I came across it on GR and was intrigued by the synopsis. I had not heard of the author before coming across the book. After listing the book \"to read\" I received a message from the author stating I may want to read Book 1 first, Spare Change. I took her advice and read it. I was not certain if the characters I knew from Spare Change would be a part of Jubilee's Journey, so I was delighted to find them included in a big way. It is for this reason I would recommend reading Spare Change first. It is not necessary but I found knowing Ethan Allen's story enhanced my enjoyment of this book. In this book Jubilee and Paul are children who come to Wyattsville after losing both their parents. Something happens upon their arrival and suddenly they are in trouble. Ethan, a child who not long ago was alone and in a jam, is determined to help Jubilee. I love that the author has children who are strong, resilient and kind. Though bad things have happened to them they are capable of loving, caring and trusting. They believe in each other and refuse to give up. There are a few adults who do bad things but most of the adults are kind and caring. I like how the author keeps things real with characters who make mistakes and may judge badly yet are able to change when they find the truth. It is the kind of story that takes you back in time and makes you long for days gone by. It tells us bad things can happen to good people but if you keep faith and keep going, good things are possible. Good people are out there. It is this message that makes this book uplifting. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8060484-linda", "userReview": "Bette Lee Crosby is not only a wonderful person, she is a wonderful author. Her books will leave a place in your heart long long after you finish reading them.This was the sequel to Spare Change and continues with Ethan Allen and Olivia but is about a little girl called Jubilee(Jubie for short) and her big brother, Paul. After their parents have both passed they leave their home to go in search of an Aunt they never met. Paul is the best big brother in the world to little Jubie and after a bus ride to Wyattsville things take a dramatic turn for the worse. Now I could go on and tell you more about this story but that would only give away the best of the best. I will say that this is such an endearing story, filled with love, tears, happiness, more tears, laughter, a few more tears, searching, wondering if things will be okay thus a few more tears, finding, feeling, caring, sharing, laughter again, realizing you were wrong(someone in the story that is), forgiveness, more laughter and tears and much happiness. It is a refreshingly sweet story that will keep you wanting to read when you should be doing other things but can't because you just have to know what happens next. Jubilee and Paul two sweet kids who both deserve a chance at love, laughter, happiness and a family to call their own. Will they get what they deserve? This is definitely one of the very best books I have read in a very long time. A historical fiction book that will leave you feeling wonderful. One of the very best books.. well since Spare Change.A definite 5 star read..

Casavant-OttoJubilee\u2019s Journey is Book Two in the Wyattsville Series by award winning author Bette Lee Crosby. This story of discovering lost family and finding love reconnects readers with Ethan Allen and the other heart-warming characters of the bestselling novel SPARE CHANGE.I absolutely loved Spare Change and Crosby did not disappoint with the second book in the series. Jubilee\u2019s Journey was well written and the characters were easy to fall in love with. Crosby writes with such eloquence you cannot help but become completely engrossed in each story. Whether you read Jubliee\u2019s Journey on its own or as part of the series, you\u2019ll enjoy every page turn. What I find most intriguing about Crosby\u2019s writing in general is how she draws the reader into the story without all the extra words some authors choose to use. Very seldom does Crosby include the color of the couch, the smell of the apple pie, etc\u2026and yet the reader can vividly picture each character and their surroundings. This is truly a gift and makes each story as individual as the reader. I look forward to the upcoming third book in the series and I am disappointed knowing the third one is slated to be the last.

Spare Change was the first book of Bette Lee\u2019s that I read and it is still my favorite. I have been an avid fan of hers ever since.The southern charm and giving nature of the characters captivate me. It makes me think of Hillary Clinton\u2019s book, It Takes A Village. This book drives home the point that a community can accomplish so much more than a single individual. We can definitely learn some lessons from the loving and giving characters in Bette Lee\u2019s novels.I love her covers and this one speaks to me as strongly as all the others. They are some of the most touching and emotional covers in their simplicity. The cover design for Jubilee\u2019s Journey was done by Kathleen Valentine of valentinedesign.com. Bette Lee will also occasionally incorporate a friend or fan\u2019s name into her novels. Living in coal country is never easy, but for Paul and Jubilee it became impossible.Their mother died and my tears began. Paul did his best to be there for Jubilee \u2013 he never returned to school, so he did all he could think of to make Jubilee\u2019s life better and took care of the house. After his father\u2019s death, they were evicted from the only home they had ever known. How would Paul keep his promise to his mother to take care of Jubilee and his promise to his father to never work in the mine?He knew of an aunt in Wyattsville, Virginia. He only had a name, Anita, but off they went.Hurt McAdams dad had abused him and raised him with fear. As a defense, he took the offensive line and became a bully, then a murderer. He ended up in Wyattsville on his search to find his father and make him pay for his miserable life.Oh no, Paul is in the store looking for work and here comes Hurt. I am very fearful, my heart is heavy with dread. I knew it. Bette!!!! But, what\u2019s this? Who should arrive but Ethan Allen and I breathe a sigh of relief. No way will he allow anything bad to happen to Jubilee.\u201cGrandma Olivia\u2019s nice. She helps kids in trouble.\u201dThat being said, I knew things would be okay. Somehow.Bette Lee Crosby writes stories as if they are biographies. They are full of the cruelties and unfairness of life, but also the beauty and wonder. The worlds and dialogue are so real, I feel as if I am there and I feel frustrated because I do not know what to do to help. She packs so much life and realism into her novels, sometimes a BOX of tissues is not enough. I laugh and cry with the characters. I go through their highs and lows, their ups and downs, all the while trying to figure out how Bette is going to make this end with a happy ever after.The ending left me begging for more. I was sitting on the edge of my seat as if my happiness was on the line.I received this book from the author in return for an honest and unbiased review.

Paul has looked after his sister since she was very little and their mother died of a fever. Their father works down the mine doing a job that he hates and he told Paul never to go down the mine. When the father is killed in a mining accident Paul is given the choice of going down the mine and keeping the company house or leave. Paul chooses to leave. He remembers that their mother had a sister \u2013 their aunt Anita \u2013 who was last heard of in Wyattsville. The two children travel by bus and when they arrive Paul sees a \u2018help wanted\u2019 sign at a general store and goes in to apply. Jubilee sits outside on a nearby bench told by her brother not to move until he gets back, and sit she does; she sits as guns go off in the store, she sits as a man runs out of the store, she sits as police arrive, she sits as ambulances arrive and take an older man and an innocent teenage boy suspected of shooting him to hospital. In fact Jubilee sits there for hours until twelve-year-old Ethan Allen comes along and sees the frightened little girl all alone. He convinces her to go with him to his Grandmother\u2019s apartment and now Olivia has two new children to help, a frightened little girl and her innocent brother.JUBILEE\u2019S JOURNEY held my interest from the very first page. It is a feel good book in the sense that good does overcome evil but for a while there you think that maybe it won\u2019t. The characters are very real, Jubilee is a lovely little girl, Ethan is a cheeky fellow with a heart of gold and a justifiable anger at the injustices going on. Olivia is just lovely and if I were ever in trouble I would want her on my side for sure. There are a few characters from the first book that turn up in this one, and while JUBILEE\u2019S JOURNEY does read as a stand alone you should read Spare Change first to see how Olivia and Ethan face danger themselves.You will laugh and you will cry and you will really like this heartwarming story."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4177345-jim", "userReview": "What I really enjoyed in this, the latest book from Ms. Crosby is that the there is a crime at the center of the story, but the details of what occurred are unknown to the characters in the story. So we have multiple perspectives; including two different children, a grandmother, a detective and a grieving wife. We get to watch as they make decisions, often poor ones, based on what they believe is the truth, or what is the right thing to do. The ramifications of the poor choices, the changing of perspectives as the truth unfolds, and ultimately the righting of wrongs is what makes the story so compelling and uplifting.Ms. Crosby makes each character so real and human that I often find myself laughing at their actions. For instance, Olivia (or \"Grandma\" as all the kids call her) delivers a meatloaf to her neighbor Barbara. \"Barbara protested, saying she'd decided to become a vegetarian. But Olivia insisted almost all vegetarians also ate meatloaf. \"They just don't talk about it,\" she said.\" Her adopted grand son Ethan also has his moments: \"Winning makes a body feel happy; I know 'cause when I play with Grandma I win most every time. But it's not 'cause she lets me; Grandma's just not real good at poker.\" (I suppose I should add that allowing kids to play poker is an indiscretion for which Grandma is constantly being chastised!)However, anyone that has read a Bette Lee Crosby book knows that she also understands sadness and loneliness. Here is what I think is one of the saddest passages in the book, and it comes right after a loving wife leaves from a visit with her husband in the hospital. \"The same sounds of breath and heartbeats could be heard in the boy's room, but nobody cried. Nobody prayed. The policeman standing outside the door yawned and checked his watch.\"Finally, I like that God is never far away: \"God gives you a load to carry, and it's a lot heavier than what you had in mind. When that happens the only thing you can do is pick up the load and get moving. You've got to trust He knows just how much you're capable of carrying.\"The books of Ms. Crosby are crafted with both great writing and story-telling skill, filled with wisdom, compassion and love, and leave you pondering the story long after the last page is turned.

Making due on his promise he made to his mother, Paul takes great care of his sister. His father does not want Paul to become a coal miner like himself, so he makes Paul promise to study hard so he can move away from the dreaded mountain and find respectable work. A few years pass and the foreman is at the door letting the children know their father has had an accident and he is not longer among the living.

While applying for a job in town, a holdup gets Paul into the line of fire and leaves Jubilee alone and confused. Ethan Allen sees Jubilee and he takes her home to his grandma. Jubilee and Paul are the strangers in town, add that to the holdup that just occurred at the area shopping market and you have some great gossip for a small town. But with Jubilee\u2019s sweet nature, Ethan Allen and grandma\u2019s determination, the story is just getting started.When reading one of Bette Lee\u2019s stories, there is this natural flow and comfort. It\u2019s like someone is telling you the story over a cup of coffee and you are sitting back and listening, There are those shocking moments where you want to say, \u201cyou don\u2019t say\u201d and continue on but otherwise you feel secure and content. In Jubilee\u2019s Journey, I didn\u2019t know how much more turmoil the two children could take. When they finally made it to VA, I had mixed feeling on what their aunt would do once she saw them but when Paul left Jubilee sitting on the bench, I was thinking, Paul what are you doing?

Though not completely necessary, this story will be much more enjoyable if you read SPARE CHANGE first, as there is a lot built on the first story in this series. Young Ethan Allen and his \"Grandma\" will befriend Jubilee in this book and the empathy they feel is because of their back story.That being said, this is once again a beautiful story of God's working in the lives of children without families, and the people of Wyattsville who take them into their hearts and homes. Seven year old Jubilee and her teen aged brother, Paul have just become orphans. They have lived in a small mining town in West Virginia, but now that their miner father has died, they must leave the company house. Paul has been caring for Jubilee all her life because of their mother's severe illness and death. Now they are traveling to Wyattsville to look for their illusive Aunt Anita, whom they've never met or talked to in their lives. All they have are some old letters that their mom had saved.On arriving in town, Paul goes to inquire about a job he saw advertised in a store window, but finds himself caught in the misfire of a holdup. Both Paul, and the store owner are injured and in comas. The robber has run away. With no reliable witnesses, there is conflict between the policeman who concludes Paul was a robber, and the policeman who feels Paul was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I could not wait for the end of the day so I could go home and finish reading.\"Spare Change\" was an amazing story of love, loss, heartbreak and the coming together of 2 strangers who become a family. \"Jubilee's Journey\" brings the people I met in \"Spare Change\" back with the addition of Paul and Jubilee. Paul is such an incredible young man, taking care of his little sister Jubilee after the tragic death of their father. They are forced to leave the only home they have ever known. Paul and Jubilee decide to go to Wyattsville to find an Aunt they did not know, hoping she would take them in and provide them with a home. After they arrive in Wyattsville, Paul decides not to seek out their Aunt. Instead, he goes into the grocery store to apply for the job he sees posted in the store window. He is hoping he will be able to support them himself. From there the story brings you more tragedy, but introduces Jubilee into the lives of Olivia and Ethan.
