Time is the murderer that never gets punished.\u201d\nCover of the Centipede Press edition painted by Matt MahurinThe first chapter is titled: The Hundred and Fiftieth Day Before the Execution. These words usher in a black cloud of impending doom. Color fades and is replaced by the shadowy gray scale of the 1940s noir movies. I can feel my nerve endings start to tingle and the piano wire that holds my skeleton together stretches tight. Cornell Woolrich was already manipulating me before I even had a chance to pour a couple of fingers of bourbon or roll a matchstick between my teeth. Scott Henderson has a fight with his wife. Not that the evening was going to be pleasant, because he was going to be asking her for a divorce, but he had bought tickets to a nice musical show and had booked a restaurant that had fond memories for both of them. These were plans made with the best of intentions, but the fickleness of fate was vibrating a few strings that would insure that the evening went nothing like he planned. There were a lot of things he should have done different. \nAlan Curtis, who died tragically young, played Scott Henderson in the movie.The evening with his wife never happens. In fact, after strafing each other with words that leaves hot shrapnel buried deep in his belly, Scott storms out of the apartment and soon finds himself in a bar with a handful of scotch and glass. A woman is there. \u201dThere was something flat about her. The light had gone out; the impact of her personality was soggy, limp. She was just some woman in black, with dark brown hair; something that blocked the background, that was all. Not homely, not pretty, not tall, not small, not chic, not dowdy; not anything at all just plain, just colorless, just a common denominator of all feminine figures everywhere. A cipher. A composite. A Gallup poll.\u201dShe was as memorable as a gray sky except for the hat she was wearing. It was an orange flame of color that draws the eye and somehow elevates her from ordinary to extraordinary. On a whim he asks the woman in the hat to help him use the tickets. An odd thing to do, but then he works for a living and earned dollars always have more value. He can\u2019t just tear up the tickets to the show. No names, no shared histories between them, what is the point after all they will never see each other again. They go to dinner, catch a cab, go to the show, and part from each other at the end of the evening knowing next to nothing about each other. He comes home to a house full of detectives and a dead wife.I can\u2019t think of a better way to put a man in the frame than to strangle his wife with his own necktie. I have around thirty stranglers in my closet. I hadn\u2019t really thought of my ties as weapons, but in a pair of strong hands a tie becomes a very capable murder weapon. None of it really makes sense to the cops, but the evidence is strong against Scott. His story is hackneyed and unbelievable. He can barely remember the woman or really even that much about the evening. As the cops follow up on his movements that night everyone who is interviewed remembers him, but doesn\u2019t remember the woman. The woman has become a phantom. The cops have their case, after all murder investigations are generally just a matter of following the numbers. They have more than enough evidence to put Scott in the electric chair. This is the ultimate nightmare, right? You know you are innocent, but all the evidence points to you. You start to question your own sanity and start to imagine the possibility that the tie was gripped in your hands, and death for those crucial seconds must have filled your eyes. \nElla Raines plays Carol Richman in the 1944 movie.Carol Richman, his girlfriend, otherwise known as his motive for murder, doesn\u2019t believe he killed his wife. His best friend John Lombard is asked to come back from South America to help find something, anything to help stay the execution. You might want to take a moment right now and go through your list of friends and acquaintances and think about who would not only stand by you under circumstances such as this, but who would also actually stretch their neck out to help save you. If your list is short or maybe even nonexistent then your list is a match for mine. As Lombard and Richman track down each of the witnesses and begin to break down their stories the plot starts to feel like script pages from the movie Angel Heart. Witnesses that finally crack are found dead before they can tell their tale to the cops. The clock is ticking and as the days and the hours count down everyone becomes more and more desperate. After all it doesn\u2019t do any good to prove Scott is innocent after the switch has been thrown. \nThe atmosphere of the novel is one of tension from the beginning to the end. The helpless terror felt by all the characters is palpable. The witnesses are squeezed. The searchers are overwhelmed by the urgency of their task. The dialogue is boiled and boiled again until it hits the reader like lead weights. If you feel safe, Woolrich will make you feel unsafe. If you are level headed and see the world with clear eyes this novel will wrap your heart in paranoia and strap dirty shot glasses over your eyes. Many of Woolrich\u2019s novels and short stories were turned into films. The Alfred Hitchcock film Rear Window was probably the most famous and best adaptation of one of his stories. The famed French director Francois Truffaut also used Woolrich creations for two of his movies. The director Robert Siodmak filmed Phantom Lady for release in 1944. That year was a marquee year for film noir. They didn\u2019t call it film noir in 1944, but Hollywood was starting to discover that Americans would pay to see dark, gritty mysteries. Ten key films were released in 1944 and those films ushered in an avalanche of great noir films. Murder, My SweetPhantom LadyLauraChristmas HolidayGaslightMinistry of FearThe LodgerThe Woman in the WIndowExperiment PerilousI read the Centipede Press edition of this book. This edition included an introduction by Barry N. Malzberg. He knew Woolrich for the last year of his life. \u201dAnd there the old man sat, poised, rigid, on a red chair in the red lobby of the Sheraton-Russell Hotel.\u201d Woolrich was beyond lonely, with no significant person in his life after his mother died. He even offered his last editor a deal to move in with him and he would leave his estate to him. The editor decided to pass which I wonder if he realized he was giving up a couple of million dollars. Hollywood had been good to Woolrich\u2019s bank account. Malzberg had his wife meet Woolrich. She makes an assessment of Woolrich which sounds right on the money to me. \u201dHe\u2019s a sad old man.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut he\u2019s a cunning sad old man.\u201d\nCornell WoolrichA biographer considered him the fourth best crime writer of his day behind Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Erle Stanley Gardner. It\u2019s always been hard for me to place numbers next to writer\u2019s names, but I will say that if you like those writers you should be reading Cornell Woolrich as well.

Scott Henderson quarrels with his wife and storms out of the house to go cool his heels. Finding himself with two show tickets and no one to use them, he arrives at an arrangement with a woman he meets in a bar. He takes her to dinner and the show, and then drops her off back where they met. No romance. No names exchanged. On returning home, he finds a fatal flaw in his plan. He now needs his nameless escort for another purpose, as an alibi.Thus begins a race against the clock, ominously portrayed by chapter headings counting down from The Hundred and Fiftieth Day Before the Execution. As the days fly by, Henderson reaches out to what few friends he has left to enlist their aid in finding the invisible companion that nobody remembers seeing. Cornell Woolrich, writing as William Irish, spins a tale with all the psychological intensity of Hitchcock\u2019s best movies. Unfortunately, the reader is asked to believe one whopper too many. The story ultimately collapses beneath the weight of the labyrinthine machinations that the killer carries out to keep the plot going. To Woolrich\u2019s credit, he did manage to keep me from figuring out the killer\u2019s identity until the last minute. Bottom line: Despite its implausibilities, the twists and turns in Phantom Lady will appeal to lovers of noir fiction. 3 starsFYI: On a 5-point scale I assign stars based on my assessment of what the book needs in the way of improvements:*5 Stars \u2013 Nothing at all. If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.*4 Stars \u2013 It could stand for a few tweaks here and there but it\u2019s pretty good as it is.*3 Stars \u2013 A solid C grade. Some serious rewriting would be needed in order for this book to be considered great or memorable.*2 Stars \u2013 This book needs a lot of work. A good start would be to change the plot, the character development, the writing style and the ending. *1 Star - The only thing that would improve this book is a good bonfire."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "In watching the movie last night, I decided that I wasn't in love with the adaptation, and I have to cry foul regarding one huge misstep (in my opinion) that made me want to walk away from the movie, even though the film definitely had some very good moments. Between movie and novel, to me it is definitely a case of book is better. I've written more about this novel (and the film) at my  reading journal if anyone is interested. Warning - there are potential spoilers there so don't be so eager to click if you don't want to know. Cornell Woolrich wastes absolutely no time in throwing out a conundrum and starting this novel on the right foot: the first chapter heading states \"The Hundred and Fiftieth Day Before the Execution,\" and in doing so sets up the first question. Who are we talking about here, and why is he/she on his/her way to the chair? By chapter five and the Ninety-First day before the execution (and we're still not too far into the novel), it becomes very obvious that what we are looking at here is a virtual race against time -- only some few pages earlier, we were still reading about the \"One Hundred and Forty-ninth Day Before the Execution.\" The tension is set -- time moves faster as the story moves forward, although for the players, things are moving excruciatingly slowly. Phantom Lady is an interesting and very good read from start to finish. It's much more than the usual \"wrong man\" scenario -- what really sticks out here are the dangling but slowly-diminishing hopes of not only the main character, but of those battling time in trying to save him, as things just constantly go from bad to worse. It is definitely a book where the reader can't help but to get caught up in the ongoing tension; it is a novel where anguish is split between what's happening on the page and what's happening in the reader's head. And trust me, it doesn't stop until the very end.Phantom Lady is a novel I would certainly recommend. A lot of people have called it Woolrich's best work, but I can't speak to that since I haven't read much of his stuff; all I know is that I really, really enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "FotisK",

Two people having dinner together, seeing a show together. No names, no addresses, no irrelevant personal references and details\u2026\u201d Scott Henderson is a condemned man. Time is of the essence. His wife, a victim of apparent foul play; yet Henderson maintains his innocence. All clues point to him, and now he awaits his death sentence. A woman who he was with could prove an alibi, but where is she? She\u2019s a phantom: no one knows her, no one has seen her. It\u2019s as if she has literally become invisible. Above all things, I think Phantom Lady is an effective mystery in that it excels in holding us in suspense for the majority of the plot. Part of the mystery is uncovering bits and pieces that could possibly give credibility to Henderson\u2019s case, but there is also a bit of a mystery figuring out why everyone involved is so hush-hush about this ill-fated night. As we get further into the case, and as Henderson awaits the days until his execution, Woolrich pushes us closer with hints and clues, careful not to reveal too much. Moreover, there is an unexpected event, a twist that definitely threw me for a loop. Phantom Lady is my first read from Cornell Woolrich, and it won\u2019t be my last. Woolrich has a way of putting the average individual in very dark and seemingly unmanageable situations, and then we see if they can worm their way out. There is an aura of fatalism that seems to grip the narrative as well, something that reminded me a bit of a David Goodis work. If there is one knock on Phantom Lady, it is the meticulously detail by detail explanation in the conclusion (after the final big reveal). We are beat over the head ad nauseum with how it went down. Other than that, I was very impressed with Phantom Lady, and looking forwards to more reads from Woolrich."}, {"userName": "Carla Remy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3318055-carla-remy", "userReview": "My copy of this is in an old book I found called The Best of William Irish - this was a pen name he had in the 40s, maybe because he produced so much (like Richard Bachman?).

Together, Henderson and this mystery woman have a fancy dinner, saw a Broadway show, and shared a cab ride home. That\u2019s the point where Henderson\u2019s life begins to unfurl, as he returns to find his wife strangled to death in their bedroom with his own necktie. The police are eager enough to accept his alibis\u2026 but nobody can place Henderson in town at the time of the murder. Not the bartender, not the waiter, not the doorman, not the cab driver. The discovery of Henderson\u2019s mistress and failing marriage put him as the prime suspect, and without any evidence of his innocence, the panicked man finds himself cast in the ultimate nightmare: an innocent man rotting on death row, counting down the hours until his execution.But Henderson is offered the slimmest ray of hope by one of the detectives on the case, having a hunch of Henderson\u2019s innocence born from years of working similar homicides. Reaching out to the imprisoned man, he prods Henderson to find somebody, anybody, who can continue the investigation and clear his name. There are two people Henderson trusts beyond all others: his friend John Lombard, who begins the tedious task of investigating every possible angle, and Scott\u2019s mistress Carol, who would (and will) walk into hell for him. Such is the life of Scott Henderson, condemned to die for a crime he didn\u2019t commit, a man without hope save for his best friend, one curious detective, and the woman who\u2019d do anything to save him. All that\u2019s left to find is this phantom lady, a wisp in Henderson\u2019s memory: a woman nobody knows and nobody saw, whose only defining feature Henderson can remember is her striking orange hat\u2026In the pantheon of noir authors, Woolrich stands as another underrated master. He didn\u2019t have Raymond Chandler\u2019s razor-edged street-smart prose, or David Goodis\u2019 desperation and crushing existential angst, or the stylish gritty flair of James M. Cain. In fact, while Woolrich\u2019s prose can be quite good, it\u2019s often peppered with leaden phrases and forced exposition; in particular, his dialogue comes across as clunky and unnatural. The last chapter is a pure Golden Age trope, unadulterated exposition where the detective explains how every clue fell into place to reveal the murderer. I found that finale dull and tedious, as it comes after several chapters of Woolrich doing what he excelled at: creating raw, unending tension. He is relentless as he batters his characters\u2014and by proxy, the reader\u2014into submission, with the characters edging close to Henderson\u2019s salvation and falling short time and time again. The chapter headers ram home the race against time, beginning with Chapter 1 (\u201cThe Hundred and Fiftieth Day Before the Execution: Six P.M.\u201d) and continuing all the way to Chapter 22 (\u201cThe Hour of the Execution\u201d).Perhaps his lack of stylistic grace has contributed to Woolrich\u2019s anonymity while Chandler and Goodis live on in the Library of America. It\u2019s not exactly fair, as Phantom Lady ranks up there with some of noir\u2019s best; even taking Woolrich\u2019s technical flaws into account, he more than succeeds at penning a suspense masterpiece\u2014the novel is brutal in all the right ways, a panicked death-spiral of fear and isolation. You suffer along with Henderson, feel the helplessness and terror of an innocent man whose life is ticking down towards an inglorious and unwarranted end. Woolrich was a master of the art of darkness, capturing loneliness and fear like few other authors of his era. Phantom Lady is intense and gripping, and if you\u2019re into this sort of thing, it\u2019s hard to put down without seeing it through all the way to the end. A must for fans of David Goodis, Jim Thompson, Dorothy B. Hughes, Charles Williams, and other purveyors of dark and downward spirals."}, {"userName": "Lee Foust", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13984676-lee-foust", "userReview": "Reading this novel made me think of a thing: what if novelists re-wrote other people's novels the way that directors re-make other auteurs' films?If one did such things, Phantom Lady would be the first novel that I would re-write. The events of the story itself are solid, creepy, interesting. So many passages are beautifully written--these I would leave intact. I loved the typical wacky offbeat noir characters, such as the reefer-mad paranoid/homicidal drummer, the ultra-temperamental Argentine diva with the pet monkey, the Irish tenement moll who shrewdly worked herself into the world of haut couture, the lost rich girl going out of her mind in flea-bag hotels and anonymous park benches in an indifferent and aloof New York City--they can all stay, each drawn as sharply and wittily as they are here, but probably in greatly shortened scenes.The story-telling itself, however, the novel's narrative structure, is entirely annoying and unduly difficult to read for such a tale. The double point of view--switching from one protagonist to another about a third of the way through the story is an off-putting bore. (I set the book down at that point and it languished and gathered much dust on the nightstand as I read any number of other novels, tried twice(!) to jump-start myself into it's story again, failing to keep momentum/interest either time, until finally gathering my fed-up-looking-at-your-cover-and-feeling-incompleteness into a tightly wound ball this afternoon, I unraveled it's energy on the last 100 pages. Phew!)The cliched final chapter in which the detective rehashes the whole story of the story's fateful night and consequential events (for the third time!), whilst filling in every detail and plot hole, seemed ENDLESS!!!! Instead of running over the events and characters of a single evening three times at various speeds, each losing the reader's interest more and more, bit-by-bit, annoyance by annoyance, repetition by repetition, somehow, through the magic of narrative form (and perhaps some heavy cutting--300 pages, really?), someone needs to save this story and these characters from this botched novel. Please. Someone. I'm just not up to it--although I do think that it would be fun to try.Sadly this is my first Woolrich--he's too popular, I'm assuming, not to be better than this so I will try another.

Henderson meets a woman in a bar near his home, a woman so nondescript that later (a little implausibly, although it is meant to be explained by his preoccupation with his situation and his later shock at what happens) he recalls nothing about her appearance - only her hat was noteworthy, a bright orange afair with upright black plume. They have a night out on a platonic basis and the only thing she does to draw attention, apart from wearing the hat, is to stand up at the theatre in the front row and flaunt herself in the spotlight, making it obvious to everyone that she has a copy of the supposedly high fashion and exclusive hat worn by the onstage South American singer. (She did it to force the singer to throw her a nosegay during the performance, when the obviously offended singer had thrown one to every other woman in the first rows and left her out because of her wearing a copy.)Later, she and Henderson part at the bar where they met and Henderson goes home, only to find the police waiting (though it is never explained who discovered the body as we find out much later that the murderer did not notify them) because his wife is dead and he is the prime suspect. Henderson plummets into nightmare as he takes the police to the bar - they have established from his wife's broken watch that he could not have done the murder if his arrival there a few minutes after six p.m. can be corroborated - and the barman denies ever seeing the woman or seeing Henderson with anyone. Then the taxi driver who took them to the restaurrant is tracked down and he also insists Henderson rode alone. The head waiter and table waiter both swear he was unaccompanied, and the box office clerk says that he came to the theatre by himself. Oddly the police do not seem to talk to the singer, but later when she is contacted as part of the private investigation by Henderson's friends, she only remembers the woman, not any man being with her so wouldn't be able to corroborate Henderson's story; however, she does remember another clue, so the police appear negligent in not speaking to her.Soon Henderson is condemned to the electric chair following a trial where his defence is ridiculed because the woman couldn't possibly exist, and he is meant to have strangled her in a fit of rage at her refusal of the divorce then coldbloodedly gone off to the restaurant etc to try to establish an alibi. (I suppose even if the singer's testimony had been used, it could have been said that he had witnessed the woman standing up at the theatre and used her as a spur of the moment alibi when confronted by the police.) But the very implausibility of Henderson's story makes the detective involved in the case start to doubt his guilt.The detective does some digging but can't spend a lot of time on the case (or so he tells Henderson) so he asks him to contact whoever would move heaven and earth to prove his innocence. Henderson has a close friend from years ago who has just gone to South America to work, so the policeman sends a telegram on his behalf and Lombard returns and starts to help investigate, tracking down other people who may be able to corroborate that the woman was with Henderson that night. Lombard is aided by Henderson's girlfriend Carol who takes risks to get into the confidence of a somewhat 'dodgy' drummer in the orchestra. But whenever they get a witness to talk, by the time they can fetch the detective to take their statement officially, said witness has had a fatal accident.Finally, Lombard has the idea of advertising for theatre programmes in exchange for money, because the woman had taken both of theirs and Henderson has the habit of turning down corners. When someone turns up with a programme like that, he gets more than he bargained for, and I found this a surprising twist.The book was a suspenseful page turning read apart from odd little glitches as mentioned above, and some of the glitches are explained in the long explanation at the end by the detective. Two things keep it from being a 5 star rating: firstly, the explanation, although necessary, comes across as rather dragged out after the murder is solved, although I didn't find it as contrived as the one in 'The Bride Wore Black' which spoiled the story much more than this one affected my reading pleasure. Secondly, there is a 'comedy interlude' when Lombard and Carol are going round interviewing the various witnesses, which was probably acceptable for the 1940s date when this was written but comes across as very racially stereotyped - Lombard visits the South American singer and the scene is played for laughs, but not amusingly for a present day reader. Other than that, the book is a good example of a race-against-time story by this writer."}, {"userName": "Tim Orfanos", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52045352-tim-orfanos", "userReview": "\u038a\u03c3\u03c9\u03c2, \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03b8\u03c1\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c2, \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf \u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1. \u0397 \u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c7\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7, \u03b5\u03bd\u03ce \u03b7 \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03ae \u03c1\u03bf\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1. \u0397 \u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 20 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf. \u0388\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5, \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b9\u03c7\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9!"}, {"userName": "Patrick Whitehurst", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7519412-patrick-whitehurst", "userReview": "So, I see.

That's the situation Scott Henderson finds himself in in Cornell Woorich's Phantom Lady.Henderson has dinner reservations at a nice restaurant and theatre tickets for two, but nobody to share them with. He decides to go into a bar for a drink and ask the first woman he sees to spend the evening with him. He finds a willing partner and they spend the evening together without sharing names or anything about themselves. When Henderson returns to his apartment he finds the police there; his wife has been murdered. Henderson takes the police to the bar, the restaurant, and the theatre, but everybody remembers Henderson being alone. Is there a vast conspiracy afoot? Or did Henderson murder his wife and imagine his companion?Woolrich was a master at capturing dread, loneliness, and the most intense desperation. He adds to this in Phantom Lady with a ticking clock: each chapter is titled \"The XXXth Day Before the Execution\". You know Henderson will be convicted of the murder and it's up to the only three people who believe him to prove his innocence. This makes the book a tight, propulsive read.
