While credit for the excellent story telling undoubtedly goes to Susy Flory, Lindy did the soul baring which makes this story so real.Unfortunately, we've become jaded to the miraculous recovery from life-threatening or life-ending accident stories, but we shouldn't. We should especially remember that a circle of family and friends go through a kind of hell right along with the victim. Lindy lets us inside her emotions as she undergoes a trial almost as traumatic as her son's injury.And one the outcome of which--like Ryan's recovery--is still in doubt at the end of the book. C. S. Lewis' masterpiece The Great Divorcefeatures a scene on the foyer of heaven in which a mother shows how she was so in love with her son and so sacrificed herself that she couldn't understand why almost everyone failed to accede to all her righteous demands. That was Lindy all through this story. She practically bankrupts her family and certainly increases everyone else's burden by her monomaniacal drama and demands.The Larry King subplot is extra interesting as he seems to have played that trick on others, coyly acting as if they are almost persuading him to Christianity while in fact not budging. It's too good a ploy to abandon.Still, a very good read."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4162558-patricia", "userReview": "Heaven Hears by Lindy Boone MichaelisLindy Boone Michaelis, by her own admission, had an almost fairy tale life. She lived in California, the daughter of Pat Boone, nothing really bad had ever happened. Until June 2001. It was then that tragedy struck. Her son, Ryan Corbin, fell through a skylight and landed on the cement floor three stories below. What follows is her story of love. Her love for her son and the Lord. Michaelis writes a heart wrenching story that is filled with courage, suffering, despair, hope, and above all faith. Her faith, the faith of her son, parents, sisters, husband, and a world of people she didn\u2019t know.Days after the accident while Ryan was still in Intensive Care in a coma with massive injuries the beginnings of a world-wide prayer vigil began. Larry King, a friend of Pat Boone, offered a few minutes of his program to Pat and Lindy. They would tell a bit of what happened and Ryan\u2019s fight to live and their belief that a miracle would happen. They asked for prayers for Ryan and those caring for him. The healing of Ryan was not instantaneous, he is still recovering today, but that he is alive is a testament to the power of prayer and the love of a mother. Lindy did whatever needed to be done to see her son survive. She had a remarkable support system in place. Her husband understood her need to be with Ryan even when it meant leaving him and their other children and moving miles away so Ryan could get the therapy he needed. Her mother stayed with her most of the time seeing to it that Ryan always had family with him. Her sisters stayed in touch constantly. Her father was with Ryan whenever commitments allowed him. Lindy\u2019s mission to see her son well again was not without its problems. Her other children felt abandoned and let down by her though they understood why she wasn\u2019t there for them like they wanted and needed. He husband at times questioned her single-minded focus on Ryan, and friends didn\u2019t understand. Lindy is honest in her telling of the years and the toll they took on her family. She is rebuilding her relationships with them one day at a time. But she is brutally honest when she says that if she knew what her single-minded devotion to Ryan would do to others in her family she doubts that it would change anything.She knows that because of her parents help she and her husband were able to care for Ryan in ways that other people are not able to care for those they love. Knowing that brain injured people often have little in the way of financial resources the Boone/Michaelis family has started Ryan\u2019s Reach to help.Though Ryan\u2019s recovery is remarkable he has a long way to go. Perhaps more remarkable is the love of his mother and how she clung to her faith in a God and the hope for complete healing. She has no doubt that Heaven Hears prayers and answers them\u2026one day at a time. This book was sent to me by Tyndale House Publishers without charge in exchange for this review."}, {"userName": "Brenda Gail", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4118273-brenda-gail", "userReview": "I just finished reading \"Heaven Hears\" by Lindy Boone Michaelis. This is a true story about a tragic accident that happens to Ryan Boone, Pat Boone's grandson. It is a story that is a wonderful example of how powerful prayers are and how they are heard in heaven.The medical doctors and emergency responders initially didn't give much hope for Ryan surviving his accident, however, they didn't realize that the Boone family, a faithful family, believed in the power of prayer. With several appearances on Larry King and continued requests for prayers from everyone, Ryan and his family experience miracles in his long road to recovery and healing.With prayers, love, and unending perseverance the Boone family and Ryan show how faith flourishes.I really enjoyed reading this story even though reading about Ryan's accident and heartbreaking recovery was difficult to read at times. It left me many times in tears. It also made me realize that because the Boone family had such a strong faith the recovery period was easier for them because they could turn everything over to God.If you are looking for a heartwarming story about the power of prayer and faith, you should put this book on your list to read.I received a copy of \"Heaven Hears\" from Tyndale Publishers for free in return for an honest review. My thoughts are my own.\ufeff"}, {"userName": "Stormie Omartian", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17403064-stormie-omartian", "userReview": "This is a true story of unwavering hope and a mother's love that refused to give up in the aftermath of tragedy.

About 11 years ago, Lindy's eldest son fell through a skylight three stories to a concrete walkway. On the way down, he bounced of the 2nd and 1st floor walls; he landed mostly on one side and suffered a TBI (traumatic brain injury).But before telling that story, she fills the reader in on \"growing up Boone\" - what it was like in their family home as Pat and Shirley Boone raised four daughters to have faith in God and to support one another. That lays the foundation to understanding how Lindy and her whole family responds to Ryan's accident.Lindy shares from her own journal some of her deepest, heartfelt thoughts during the dark early days after Ryan's fall when doctors gave them no hope and throughout his unexpected but mightily prayed-for (and on-going) recovery. We see Daddy Pat's fame and friendship with Larry King give them a national - nay, worldwide - platform to share their faith and request prayers for Ryan. This book will appeal to those in every stage of their faith walk and to those who wonder if (& how) a famous person touting Christianity really lives it out day to day, especially under such extraordinary circumstances. It will appeal to mothers who know they'd give anything for their child to be well, and to those who may have had to support families in crisis. And it will appeal to anyone who enjoys real stories of indomitable spirits. It's a good book to read before anything like this happens in your family or one you're close to - because throughout there is good information about things to consider in that case. As a current cancer patient, I related to some of the medical issues. It's a quick read; some say a single sitting, though I took two evenings. Well written and includes photos of Ryan at various stages in his recovery journey as well as some vintage Boone family pictures.Note: I received a copy of this book free from one of the authors without a request to review, much less offer a positive review."}, {"userName": "Jeanie", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15678788-jeanie", "userReview": "Goodreads, thank you so much for selecting me as a winner of this incredible book - it will be re-read and shared!This is, without a doubt, the most amazing testimony that I have read/heard for a very long time! I heard a bit about Pat Boone from my mother when I was growing up, as she appreciated the faith of he and his wife and how they raised their family. God does amazing things when we pray and believe!! Lindy's faith transformation and Ryan's continual healing are two of the miracles - as well as anybody who has come to faith in Jesus as their Lord and Savior as a result of learning about God's work in Ryan. The continual prayers, care, and faith in God that Shirley demonstrated from the very beginning is humbling - and her unwavering belief in the words the Lord gave her, based on Psalm 118 - \"He will live and not die, and declare the glory of God!\" If you have ever asked \"why, God?\", if you want to see in action the faith transformation in Ryan before his accident, the faith in action of Lindy, Shirley, Pat, and all of the family, this book is for you. The testimony God's faithfulness and healing power is not one to be missed. We all have the choice in the tragedies and trials in our lives, and Lindy's words sum up the conclusion that I have been struggling with in a situation - \"I chose to press in...I'd better abandon myself to the idea that God and I were going to go to the next level of our relationship\". Thank you to every member of the Boone family, especially Lindy and Ryan, for sharing your lives. You are living out Ryan's verse: \"...Christ (the Messiah) will be magnified and get glory and praise in this body of mine and be boldly exalted in my person\" (Philippians 1:20 AMP). God is highly exalted!!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21087038-elizabeth", "userReview": "Heaven Hears is the amazing story of one woman\u2019s courage and faith in God during a tragedy that no mother should have to go through. Lindy and her family were vacationing in Spain when they receive a call that their 24 year old son, Ryan had fallen 40 feet and was barely hanging onto life. Fighting feelings of terror, worry, and dread, the family takes the earliest flight they could to return home to see Ryan. What they see and find out about Ryan\u2019s prognosis is shocking and very grim. The doctors tell the family that Ryan\u2019s injuries would most likely take his life or result in him living in a vegetative state for the remainder of his life. Despite the prognosis, Lindy and her family choose to listen the voice of God that tells them that Ryan would live and would be used to glorify God. And, that is exactly, what happened. Despite the grim prognosis, Ryan survived his fall. He came out of his coma several weeks later. Despite a serious head injury and brain damage, he made slow progress towards healing with the help of doctors, nurses, caregivers, therapists, and the prayers of millions of people. Because Ryan is the grandson of Pat Boone, his family was invited to appear on the Larry King show. When the family shared their story and about Ryan\u2019s prognosis/progress, millions wrote or called in to show their support. However, many more kept Ryan and his family in their prayers. Over the course of 11 years, Ryan has beat the odds and today, he is re-learning to walk. It is amazing how God can use on tragedy to show His glory and to strengthen the faith of those who love Him."}, {"userName": "Denise DiFalco", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1593331-denise-difalco", "userReview": "Ryan Corbin's story retold by his mother, Lindy Boone Michaelis in 'Heaven Hears ~ The True Story of What Happened When Pat Boone Asked The World to Pray For His Grandson's Survival' proves that nothing, absolutely nothing is impossible with God. The evidence of God's power is magnified throughout the chapters of this inspiring testimony. Ryan's desire was to serve the Lord and he spent many hours reading the scriptures in hopes of completing a screenplay which depicts the Life of Christ in Modern Times. His devotion pays off as he completes this project. One sentence in his play stands out because of what lies ahead in his future, '\"I think something is going to happen to me\"' becomes a self premonition or perhaps God was getting him prepared for his future. On June 19, 2001 there is a horrific freak accident. Ryan steps through a skylight and falls three stories onto a cement floor. The impact leaves the doctors wondering if Ryan will even survive. In his comatose state, his family reaches out to everyone to pray. Pat Boone is invited on the Larry King show where he pleads with the TV viewers to pray. Miraculously, Ryan awakens but he has a long tough road ahead. Some doctors claimed he would remain a vegetable. His amazing faithful mother would not succumb to the doctors diagnosis. She knew that her Father in Heaven could do all things. Heaven Hears will renew the reader's faith and comfort mother's to know that their children are in God's hands.

Then this book got weird and boring. First, I don't think it was anyone's business that Ryan's mom had to tell us that he lost his virginity. At times I thought Lindy was way over protective, and at times I didn't feel like she was a very good mom at all. Especially to her two other kids. I do wish the book had come with photos, as I would love to put faces with names. And I cannot believe how Lindy freaked out about her daughter feeding Ryan chocolate pudding, calling it a fatty and filled with calories snack, but was perfectly ok with taking him to McDonald's and feeding him a hamburger,fries and a shake.about 75% through this book I was ready to just do a google search to find out if Ryan ever became normal again or if he stayed the same. I did stick with the book, but still think just reading the cliff notes in the Internet would have been a whole lot better."}, {"userName": "Jennie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34209954-jennie", "userReview": "The undeniable power of prayerHeaven Hears is the amazing true story of how Ryan Corbin, a grandson of Pat Boone, survived a three-story fall through a skylight onto a cement floor.

This wasn't just one prayer by one family. It ended up being thousands of prayers by thousands of families all across this nation. Ryan Boone has been saved for a reason and God must surely have bigger plans for him. I was less enthused by the history of Lindy. I just felt some of her history was unnecessary and poorly written. Her faith was unshakeable and undeniable. I would like to have heard more about Ryan and his story, rather than Lindy's, that's all. I'm not bashing her by any means.
