So, I\u2019ll try to explain my experience in my Italian-English, be quiet.I think the credit for this belongs to the author skill. The story is told with a clear language, but the plot is at the same time excellent.In the suggestive frame of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Norah Cooper looses his beloved husband Joe, a respected policeman in Boston, killed during a robbery in a bank. But another bad news is coming when she knew that she had to leave their cottage in two weeks because Joe secretly sold it.Was he a liar? How could he? Last, but not least, Joe begins to send messages via scrabble, and Norah understands that there something very important other.When you start to read, you can\u2019t stop and this is the first good thing. You discover characters and situations one by one, and you have to upset your attention to not loose any trail. In fact, nothing is left back and the final is worthy.This book is as good as any other mistery thriller, with the only difference that the author isn\u2019t -yet- prominent.People who knows those places can easily recognize landscapes and ferries. We, bleeding hearts, can think about Harrison Ford and Michele Pfeiffer in \u201cWhat lies beneath\u201d.

Il romanzo mi \u00e8 piaciuto per due motivi. Il pi\u00f9 ovvio \u00e8 la sceneggiatura da thriller classico, robusta e priva di punti deboli, condita da sorprese, cattivi-che-sembrano-buoni e viceversa, con l'irruzione del paranormale e un finale appropriato. Il meno scontato \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che sta dietro la trama: la caratterizzazione dei personaggi e soprattutto una storia d'Amore con la A maiuscola, insolita perch\u00e9 ne sono protagonisti una donna e un uomo di mezza et\u00e0, prossimo alla pensione. Non il tempo delle mele, una volta tanto, ma quello dei nipotini. E la malinconia della perdita raccontata con sensibilit\u00e0, partecipazione e le parole dell'autunno della vita. \u00c8 questa, secondo me, la marcia in pi\u00f9 del racconto e la giustificazione del ritmo diseguale, che alterna le pause con le accelerazioni, i \"perch\u00e9\" cercati con il piombo nel cuore a quelli scoperti con inquietudine, ansia e infine terrore.

I have previously read other stories written in Italian by Giulia Beyman and I am positively amazed by her English mystery novel.The main character, Nora, is a well developed and interesting woman who is coping with the loss of her husband - a cop killed during a robbery.It's impossible not to feel with Nora the huge pain she's been through, given also the many surprises her dead husband was holding for her.The paranormal aspect of the story spices up the plot enough to keep me glued to my Kindle and force me to go to bed very late at night!Definitely an author and a series to follow!I received a free, advance copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Sara Lunardi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25549796-sara-lunardi", "userReview": "Not reading this book is a \"crime!\"This book impressed me so much. Not only is a well-written crime book\u2014 it reminds me of Agatha Christie's classic, sophisticated and timeless style\u2014, not only does it contain suspense and action, but it has a heart. The relationships that link the characters are deep and believable, and the problems the characters have to face are common in the everyday life of each one of us. Besides, wisely, the author adds a dash of romance to catch the attention of the female readers too. I fell for the protagonist, Nora, immediately. She suffers a terrible loss at the beginning of the story: her husband, a cop, has been killed during a bank robbery. Nora's life falls to pieces when she discovers that her husband has sold their house without telling her. But this is not the only mystery that crosses her life. Nora, a practical and solid person, finds herself involved in supernatural events. Has she become mad?One plot twist after the other, the reader follows Nora's stubborn search for the truth. Despite her pains and worries, she always does the right thing: she wants justice for her husband and she doesn't give up protecting her beloved ones; her daughter and her grandchildren. She is a fighter, she is smart, but she is also a woman with vulnerability: she missses her husband and she is afraid of losing her house. The reader can't help but follow her story with bated breath. I look forward to reading more. I'm sure the second book of Nora Cooper Mysteries won't disappoint me at all."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9850325-judy", "userReview": "My Review: I loved this book.

Although Guilia is Italian her books are set in the US which is an interesting mix. As someone passionate about all things Italian and who writes crime novels primarly set in the UK but with a strong Italian influence and many Italian characters I was keen to read Guilia's book. The English version is available as an ebook and readily available from Amazon. I found this to be an enjoyable and fast read and Guilia is very good at leaving enough dangling at the end of a chapter to make the reader continue reading. Guilia has a very easy writing style and I can tell that she has been a screenwriter as she writes great dialogue. I really took to her central character Nora who is a very well-rounded character.If you are looking for blood and guts and lots of dead bodies then this is not the book for you, as this is definitely a cozy crime novel. It doesn't have a particularly complicated plot but then neither did many of Agatha Christie's books and they are not short of appeal.I don't want to give away the plot as that spoils the read, but let's say Nora is possessed with certain 'gifts' that most of us don't have.All in all I'd recommend this book. Good to curl up with on a cold winter's evening. It only took me a few hours to read it and I am looking forward to reading the second book in the series 'A Cry in the Shadows.'"}, {"userName": "Martina Munzittu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10848063-martina-munzittu", "userReview": "Nora is grieving for the loss of her husband, who has been killed during a bank robbery. The story starts this way, and as a reader you already feel hooked, you somehow feel her pain, and you start to care about this lovely character, as if she were a close friend. There are many surprises in store for Nora, and our heroine is thrown into a world of mystery, turmoil, where her emotions are shattered in such a way that sometimes she wonders about her mental sanity. I found myself glued to this book until 1 or 2 am, I just didn't want to put it down. It has you guessing, wondering and yet, it's never predictable, and things never turn out as you expect. I could see this novel turned into a film, as it's packed with action, drama, surprises, it would make a great movie. But it's also a fantastic book, something that really gets you involved and makes you forget about your ordinary life. That for me, is what a good book is all about."}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6865631-jenn", "userReview": "Joe and Nora Cooper were going to enjoy their later years in their newly purchased dream home on Martha's Vineyard.

Overall I like this book. It has a slight supernatural element to a mystery story.

I mean how does the grandma have the diary and not tell anyone what it reveals. I like how three different incidents (missing girl, murder of a husband, and an almost secret selling of a cottage)and people involved in those situations are connected.

I diversi punti di vista sulla storia anzi aggiungevano dei dettagli per la risoluzione del mistero che non vedevo l'ora finissero nelle mani della persona che avrebbe \"tirato le fila\" del libro. Ho trovato a volte delle piccole debolezze: nei libri (in particolare nel primo) c'\u00e8 un'attenzione maniacale a cosa indossano le protagoniste femminili, tanto da informarci di ogni loro cambio d'abito; nel terzo volume invece abbiamo un capitolo intero dedicato alla preparazione della parmigiana di melanzane di Nora... Cosa che sinceramente mi interessa, ma non all'interno di un romanzo giallo :-P In genere non apprezzo molto neanche il paranormale inserito nella quotidianit\u00e0, soprattutto quando \u00e8 usato un po' come deus ex machina che risolve una situazione da cui altrimenti l'autore non saprebbe tirarsi fuori. Qui per\u00f2 \u00e8 solo un mezzo che d\u00e0 l'avvio all'indagine da parte di Nora, ed \u00e8 sinceramente utilizzato bene.

Qui l\u2019autrice \u00e8 davvero abile nel creare pi\u00f9 storie iniziali, nel disseminare gli indizi e poi nel far convergere le vicende in uno sbocco comune e inatteso, come un piccolo ragno che riconduce tutti i fili al centro.
