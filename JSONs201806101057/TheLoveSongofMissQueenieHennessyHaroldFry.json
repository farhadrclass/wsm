Rachel Joyce in this novel has answered all of the questions I had about Queenie and I now know that she was worth every mile that Harold walked and then some .Queenie is in a hospice spending her last days writing a letter to a man she worked with at a brewery in an English town . At the same time, that man , Harold Fry is on a walking journey to see her before she dies . We learn so much about Queenie in her letter - about her childhood, her days at the university where she studied the classics , her losses , her time working with Harold and how she spent her days after leaving , living in a beach house and tending her beloved sea garden. There should be nothing light about this story . A dying woman is in hospice writing a letter seeking forgiveness . New patients come and others die . But yet it was delightful to come to know some of Queenie's fellow patients who will make you laugh as well as cry . These characters will steal your heart . The feisty and sometimes potty mouthed Finty , Pearly King , Barbara , Mr . Henderson. Finty was my favorite as she takes to Twitter - #Harold Fry, #Queenie Hennessy, #hospice , #respect .The story at some point becomes about more than Harold's walk and more than Queenie's letter but about this group of patients and these lovely nuns especially Sister Mary Inconnu who types out Queenie's notes and gives her so much more . They drink to Harold with their nutritional drinks and then the reality of it - Barbara wishes for \"one more Christmas \". A particularly moving scene was when Sister Mary Inconnu helps Queenie to feel and smell a peach and taste it when she didn't think she could swallow . Harold's journey on the road and Queenie's journey waiting for Harold becomes theirs as well . \"That's it , then, \" said Finty . \"It's a unanermous vote. From now on , no one dies . We're all waiting for Harold Fry .\"This book is about living and dying with dignity , friendship , love , about regrets and acceptance , and how people have the capacity to make people who don't know them , fall in love with them. I suppose that you could read Queenie's story on its own since it really is not a sequel but has been called a companion piece telling the story of their journeys simultaneously. I would say do yourself a favor and read The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry in order to fully experience just how meaningful the lives of these far from ordinary people were to those around them .I'll be thinking about the ending and that last letter to Harold for a long time . Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Random House and NetGalley.( I really loved this book and while reading it I reread parts The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and after doing so decided that it was a 5 star book instead of 4 as I had originally rated it . I have changed my rating.)"}, {"userName": "Jaline", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline", "userReview": "In \u201cThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\u201d, Harold believes that if he walks from his home on the South coast of England to where Queenie Hennessy is in a hospice on the North coast of England, he will be able to save her. And there is a reason he wants to save her.In \u201cThe Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy\u201d, Queenie is on her own pilgrimage while in the hospice. She is reviewing her life, and particularly the years since she met Harold Fry at work (he says in the stationary cabinet, while she says it was in the canteen). For twenty-four years Queenie has quietly and secretly loved Harold and she is intent on writing out her story in a long letter to him. There are parts of her story she feels compelled to tell Harold about.Queenie is offered assistance in her mission by Sister Mary Inconnue. Queenie can no longer speak as they had to remove part of her throat and tongue in their effort to save her life from cancer. So Queenie writes out her story in shorthand and Sister Mary Inconnue transcribes the pages, faithfully typing them out nearly every day.This story, Queenie\u2019s story, is distressing and uplifting; it is poignant and happy. There is mourning and there is laughter. The Sisters and volunteers in the hospice embrace all the patients as family, enjoying their small victories and sharing their sorrows. Queenie writes about this as well. She wants to write down everything so when Harold reads it, he can experience the context of her journey as well.When news of Harold Fry\u2019s pilgrimage spreads throughout the hospice, so does a new atmosphere of hope. A banner is constructed and a special corner set up for Harold Fry\u2019s postcards and to pin up any news of his pilgrimage. It becomes a great occasion any time a postcard arrives and everyone becomes part of the excitement.In between times, Queenie writes and writes some more. Even when she is fatigued and her hand is sore, she continues to write. Her story unfolds like memories do: sometimes 24 years ago, sometimes 4 years ago, and sometimes even further than 24 years ago. Queenie is writing a very long letter; she is also composing a love song. Queenie also knows that she will not be finished until she has written Harold with all the secrets she has harbored for years. Queenie burns for Harold\u2019s forgiveness for one secret in particular.This book is beautifully written and the story is engaging from the first page. There are some tearful moments while reading Queenie\u2019s journey through her life, yet nothing had prepared me for the end. When it was over tears were raining down my cheeks, wetly blending wonder and sadness together.I cannot recommend this book highly enough, and to receive the full impact of the beautiful story of Harold Fry and Queenie Hennessy, I strongly recommend they be read in order."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I actually enjoyed this even more than The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry. At first I was not so sure because Queenie came across as a very insipid and needy person and I wondered how she was going to sustain a whole book. But then the story moved into the hospice and up popped all these marvellous characters. I ended up enjoying the parts of the story about the hospice much more than the parts relating to her past life and Harold Fry. The author achieved a remarkable balance between happy and sad and it was so good to see Queenie finally realise her life had not been so bad after all. The end ties in very neatly with the ending of its companion volume. Very well done indeed and I will certainly read more books by Rachel Joyce."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "As much as I loved The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, I liked this one even more. Both of these books contain the stories of ordinary lives, made extraordinary because of the actions of the characters to connect with others. Harold's story was his walking 600 miles to see Queenie before she died; Queenie's story was about her wait for him in the hospice, to stay alive until he arrived. Along the way, we get both their histories.Waiting with Queenie are the other dying patients at the hospice and the gentle nuns who care for them. Harold's postcards sent from the road give them all a small measure of hope, that they too can hang on to await his arrival. Where we get Harold's story from his thoughts and encounters along the road, Queenie relates her history in a letter to Harold, since she can no longer speak because of her tumor. We know from the first book that Harold gets to Queenie just before she dies, but there is a surprising twist at the end regarding her letter.This was a wonderful book with a lot of everyday wisdom that slips up on you as you read, like this passage: \"It has been everywhere, my happiness - when my mother sang for me to dance, when my father took my hand to keep me safe - but it was such a small, plain thing that I mistook it for something ordinary and failed to see. We expect our happiness to come with bells and whistles, but it doesn't.\"If you read Harold Fry, you owe it to yourself to finish the journey with Queenie. Oh, and a special note to Rachel Joyce - I want Finty to have her own book."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "Not a \nHarold Fry\n prequel or sequel but a parallel story, told in Queenie\u2019s first-person narration as an extended deathbed letter as she waits for Harold to arrive. The humor-tinged hardship of hospice life alternates with touching vignettes from her past. Better than the original \u2013 more inventive, allusive and intimate.When I saw Joyce speak at the 2014 Hungerford Literary Festival, she mentioned that she wrote Harold Fry and Queenie Hennessy simultaneously, emphasizing the idea that these two characters are journeying side by side. In fact, Joyce revealed that there are plot crossovers between the novels. For instance, towards the end of his walk Harold has to tape his yachting shoes onto his feet; to finish writing her letter, Queenie asks a nun to tape her pencil into her grip.\u201cMy life has been small, it has been nothing to speak of. But the past is still inside me, Harold. I have never let it go.\u201d It is a privilege to hear Queenie\u2019s voice here.See my full review at The Bookbag."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "EXCERPT: Your letter arrived this morning. We were in the dayroom for morning activities. Everyone was asleep.Sister Lucy, who is the youngest nun volunteering in the hospice, asked if anyone would like to help with her new jigsaw. Nobody answered. \u201cScrabble?\u201d she said.Nobody stirred.\u201cHow about Mousetrap?\u201d said Sister Lucy. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely game.\u201dI was in a chair by the window. Outside, the winter evergreens flapped and shivered. One lone seagull balanced in the sky.\u201cHangman?\u201d said Sister Lucy. \u201cAnyone?\u201dA patient nodded, and Sister Lucy fetched paper. By the time she\u2019d got sorted, pens and a glass of water and so on, he was dozing again.Life is different for me at the hospice. The colors, the smells, the way a day passes. But I close my eyes and I pretend that the heat of the radiator is the sun on my hands and the smell of lunch is salt in the air. I hear the patients cough, and it is only the wind in my garden by the sea. I can imagine all sorts of things, Harold, if I put my mind to it.Sister Catherine strode in with the morning delivery. \u201cPost!\u201d she sang. Full volume. \u201cLook what I have here!\u201d\u201cOh, oh, oh,\u201d went everyone, sitting up.Sister Catherine passed several brown envelopes, forwarded, to a Scotsman known as Mr. Henderson. There was a card for the new young woman. (She arrived yesterday. I don\u2019t know her name.) There is a big man they call the Pearly King, and he had another parcel though I have been here a week and I haven\u2019t yet seen him open one. The blind lady, Barbara, received a note from her neighbor\u2014\u00adSister Catherine read it out\u2014\u00adspring is coming, it said. The loud woman called Finty opened a letter informing her that if she scratched off the foil window, she would discover that she\u2019d won an exciting prize.\u201cAnd, Queenie, something for you.\u201d Sister Catherine crossed the room, holding out an envelope. \u201cDon\u2019t look so frightened.\u201dI knew your writing. One glance and my pulse was flapping. Great, I thought. I don\u2019t hear from the man in twenty years, and then he sends a letter and gives me a heart attack.THE BLURB: When Queenie Hennessy discovers that Harold Fry is walking the length of England to save her, and all she has to do is wait, she is shocked. Her note had explained she was dying. How can she wait? A new volunteer at the hospice suggests that Queenie should write again; only this time she must tell Harold everything. In confessing to secrets she has hidden for twenty years, she will find atonement for the past. As the volunteer points out, 'Even though you've done your travelling, you're starting a new journey too.' Queenie thought her first letter would be the end of the story. She was wrong. It was the beginning. MY THOUGHTS: I didn't want this book to end......I quite fell in love with Miss Queenie Hennessey and the other residents of the hospice.This book moved me to tears, made me laugh, made me think about me relationship with my mother, with my grandmothers, with my sons.It made me remember how selfish we are as young adults, so uncertain in ourselves, but so certain that we know so much more than our parents.It brought back memories, both good and painful. This delightful book is a journey in itself.Queenie has had to move into the hospice to die - she is removed from her beloved house by the sea and her sea garden, her garden of tribute to those she has loved, her garden of memories.Faced by her imminent death, she writes to Harold Fry, her unrequited love, and he sets out to walk the length of England to be with her. Scared that she will not live long enough to see him, she takes up the challenge when a new volunteer at the hospice suggests that Queenie should write again; only this time she must tell Harold everything.His unlikely pilgrimage captivates the other hospice residents, with whom Queenie - who has kept herself apart since her arrival - slowly makes friends.I will be seeking out Rachel Joyce's other works. An unreserved recommendation from me.I own my copy of this book. All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own personal opinions.

I liked reading Queenie\u2019s story and about her unrequited love for Harold. I liked the interaction between her and David, Harold\u2019s son, though I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have been as generous as she was. I loved reading about her sea garden. The writing is beautiful, especially the description of the Northumberland Coast \u2018I sat with my suitcase, and while I ate the bread and drank the water I gazed out over the bay. The sun was high and threw stars at the sea. The air shimmered with heat, like a veil of water.\u2019 I was right there with Queenie. This is a book about love and loss, living and dying. I loved this, \u2018If only memory were a library with everything stored where it should be. If only you could walk to the desk and say to the assistant, I\u2019d like to return the painful memories about \u2026 and take out some happier ones, please.\u2019 And also, \u2018sometimes you cannot clear the past completely. You must live alongside your sorrow.\u2019So I enjoyed the writing, except for the intrusive f word that popped up at times. Some of the people in the hospice were certainly characters and the nuns caring for them lovely.

The timing of this novel is parallel to that earlier work and it tells of what is happening while Harold walks, the reason he walks, the present life of Queenie and their interlacing history. It would be easy to say too much of the story, such as it is, and I do not want to do that. Those who have read of Harold know that Queenie is dying, but here we learn of her living and of her life when she knew Harold and after and now in the Hospice. There were moments in this story that just spoke so strongly to me. What might seem like obvious truisms to some, were very meaningful to me.You don't get to a place by constantly moving, even if your journey is only one of sitting still and waiting. Every once in a while you have to stop in your tracks and admire the view, a small cloud and tree outside your window. You have to see what you did not see before. And then you sleep. (loc 1385)As one who has spent more time sitting than moving in recent months, this is so relate-able for me. Joyce has captured this so well. And the following moment of extreme restlessness, whether from physical or emotional discomfort--also is captured so well, so simply.I can't sleep. I lie still and stillness is too much and I have to get up. But when I am up, that is not right either, Nothing is the thing I am hunting for. (loc 3668)Rachel Joyce has given us a wonderful woman in Queenie Hennessy, a woman with heart and soul, a woman full of memory. For that, I thank her.Very highly recommended.A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "There will be people who really like this. Unfortunately, I am not one. I found this novel comparable to one by Nicholas Sparks and, yet, he is extremely popular. I found it to be so-so.

Queenie is in a hospice run by nun dying from a tumor in her throat area. She can no longer talk and writesher story in shorthand that was transcribed by a nun. She wants to give it to Harold when he arrives to explain herself to him. The story meanders between her times with Harold, her \"exile\" and her current circumstances.

If only you could walk to the desk and say to the assistant, I\u2019d like to return the painful memories about \u2026 and take out some happier ones, please\u201dThe Lovesong of Miss Queenie Hennessy is the third novel by actress, radio playwright and author, Rachel Joyce, and is a companion volume to her first novel, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry. Queenie Hennessy is dying. When she hears that Harold Fry is walking from Devon to Berwick-upon-Tweed to save her, that all she has to do is wait, she is transported back twenty years to Kingsbridge, to the brewery, to her relationship with Harold Fry. Her guilt about the events of that time has haunted her ever since, but a volunteer nun at St Bernadine\u2019s Hospice convinces her to write to Harold Fry, to confess the truth, finally, before she dies. As Queenie fills her notebook, the events that led to her departure from Kingsbridge are revealed: some things, readers of Harold Fry will have suspected; others, they will have wondered about; and some will come as a complete surprise. Interspersed with her confessions are descriptions of Queenie\u2019s Sea Garden and bits of everyday life in a hospice, some of which are hilarious (nutritional protein shakes that taste like wet cardboard, diversional therapy ideas, knitted syringe-driver covers), others, like the inevitable deaths, sad. Joyce gives the reader a cast of quirky characters: na\u00efve nuns (and some very wise ones); a cranky Scot; a foul-mouthed woman who loves hats and entering competitions; a one-armed man constantly in receipt of parcels and an inexperienced counselor. She gives Queenie many words of wisdom: \u201cWe write ourselves certain parts and then keep playing them as if we have no choice\u201d; \u201cI found out what was right only by getting it wrong\u201d; \u201cSometimes people judge their happiness by the price they have to pay for it.

You must live alongside your sorrow\u201d are a few examples.Joyce has, of course, ensured that the events of this novel dovetail perfectly with Harold Fry, and while Queenie Hennessy can be read independently of the earlier book, readers will find that the experience is much enhanced by reading Harold Fry first. Once again, the illustrations by Andrew Davidson are truly charming. Fans of Harold Fry will not be disappointed: if anything, Queenie Hennessy surpasses that book with its characters and also some lovely descriptive prose: \u201cI have noticed the rain clouds drawing over the earth like a slate tablecloth and the wind beating at the black sea and tossing the gulls up and down like twists of white paper\u201d and \u201cThe small leaves on the tree outside my window have stretched into green hands\u201d.

In the first book Harold is trekking cross country to visit Queenie Hennesey a former coworker in an English brewery after she sends him a letter from a hospice bidding him farewell. In this one, we get the story from Queenie's side learning how she comes to write both the letter that starts his journey, and a confessional letter about her life to give to him as she awaits his arrival. Both stories are full of life's lessons, happy and sad, these being elderly folks who are looking back on their lives. Queenie's story is probably the more poignant as she's been secretly in love with Harold (a married man) her entire adult life. These two books have made Rachel Joyce a very popular author.

Twenty years while she tended her beloved sea garden and thought daily of Harold and her deep love for him. But Harold was married to Maureen, so Queenie\u2019s love had been one sided; quiet and unattainable.But when Queenie\u2019s body was slowly taken over by cancer and she was no longer able to care for herself, she entered the nearby hospice where she would spend the remainder of her life, cared for by the kind and devoted nuns of St Bernadine\u2019s. Unable to speak, she had her notebook and pencil with her always. As she deteriorated, she decided to write a short letter to Harold to let him know she was dying; but when she received a reply from him stating he was walking to her and she was to wait, she and the rest of the residents were astounded.Sister Mary Inconnue, a French nun, gently suggested to Queenie that she write a letter to Harold; one which he would read when he arrived at the hospice, and one in which Queenie would tell all the secrets that she felt she had withheld from Harold \u2013 confessing was good for the soul Sister Mary told her.

I had won a copy of Joyce's parallel book -- The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry -- through Goodreads before it came out in 2012. I knew nothing about Joyce or her book, but was absolutely delighted by the quirky heart felt story. And I enjoyed Joyce's new book just as much but for different reasons. The stories are very much connected and I have trouble imagining reading Queenie's story without having first read Harold's. But in many ways, the books are oddly different thematically. Queenie's story is told in the form of a long letter to Harold in which she slowly confesses the source of 20 years of feeling guilty for Harold's misfortune. The letter is written while Queenie is in a palliative care hospital dying of cancer as Harold makes his unlikely pilgrimage toward her. Queenie's \"confession\" is very readable, but for me by far the best parts of the books were the one's in which Queenie depicts her life in the hospital. It's an oddly unmelodramatic -- yet sad and empathetic -- view of dying amongst a group of people who all know their deaths are imminent. Joyce also gives Queenie the odd brilliant insight. For example, Queenie describes her parents' relationship as an old coat that her mother keeps meaning to throw out and that her father keeps meaning to mend. Bottom line: if you can, read Joyce's books back to back starting with Harold's story, but don't be too fussed about thematic differences.

With her body riddled with the scourge of cancer and knowing she does not have much more time she writes to an old friend who she has not seen for over 20 years. When she discover's Harold is walking across the country in a bid as he sees it to save her she decides she has to come clean with her past feelings towards him and what she believes is her role in the fate of his son.With the help of kind staff Queenie writes to Harold about the short time she spent with him when she unexpectedly fell in love and despite knowing he was married was happy to admire from the sidelines. The beginning of the end for her and Harold will come with David. In his fathers eyes is a wayward son, who would \u201crather die than be ordinary\u201d. What he does not know is the lopsided attachment between the two as despite him stealing from her, she does nice things for him such as lending him money and books. Despite her efforts, she fails to rescue him from the darkness that overcomes him. The old fashioned names are familiar but unlike The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry this is Queenie's side of the story that is full of unrequited romance, harrowing loss and making things right. In particular the scenes between the verbally aggressive David and the lovelorn Queenie, measured out in ever stronger doses, create a dramatic tension the earlier book lacked. The scenes at the hospice are also deeply moving and poignant.

Queenie's voice is well-pitched and sure; and the banality of her environment throws her rich inner life into sharp relief.

This is just fine as a stand-alone novel. Queenie is dying. She spent much of her life in love with a simple man who could never be hers. When she finds out that Harold is walking over 600 miles to see her in the hospice, she begins her own journey. She starts slowly recounting and writing her life before, during, and after Harold. The terrible thing that happened led both of them, in their own way, to withdraw from the world. In The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, we read about Harold's life before, during, and after Queenie. During his journey, he has time to reflect and come to terms with the terrible thing that happened, his friendship with Queenie, and his marriage. He learns from the myriad of people he encounters on his long walk across England, and many are touched by him in some way.While Queenie is in the hospice, she is surrounded with patients and hospice nuns around her that are as varied and distinct as flowers in a garden. The wonderful moments that were created by the nuns at the hospice were so meaningful to me since I work in hospice.This is a testimony of how we affect each other, how grief moves through us, and how the choices we make determine our present and future.Queenie's story comes slowly to life, winds it's tendrils around your heart, and wraps you close like a warm blanket. You will smile, ache, and hope for her as you immerse yourself in her story.\nThank you Netgalley and Random House Publishing for a free digital copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Noeleen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5333773-noeleen", "userReview": "The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry was my favourite book to read in 2012. My review of Harold Fry here athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Harold Fry made me cry at lot and I don\u2019t cry easily!...I was delighted to receive The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy as a Christmas gift so that I could continue with the story from Queenies perspective. Thanks Marion!Rachel Joyce has stated that Queenies story is not a sequel to Harold Fry, but rather a companion to the first book and that\u2019s exactly what it is, a parallel version of events told from Queenies point of view. In this book, Queenie is in the hospice waiting for Harold\u2019s arrival and the story is told from her side, her reminisces of the past, her feelings for Harold, her experiences with Harold\u2019s son and her attempt to confess secrets she feels need to be revealed. This book was simultaneously both humorous and very sad. The very amusing, witty and entertaining aspects were provided by the other residents and carers in the hospice who were absolutely wonderful characters. It was almost ironic that these characters could have so much fun together while slowly dying in a care facility or taking care of those dying, but their wit, enthusiasm, friendship and support for each other is what got them through their last days. I adored Queenies character, her telling of her experiences out with Harold on their road trips for work, and her sea garden. I could imagine the sea garden so clearly from the descriptions and it sounded just wonderful. I wasn't too enamoured with the story of Queenies experiences with Harold\u2019s son and this is probably the only reason that I refrained from giving this book five stars. In addition, as with Harold Fry, I really loved the little illustrations throughout the book.This was an excellent read, a complimentary addition to Harold and Queenies story and I admit I did shed a tear or two throughout this one too.

As well as telling us more about Queenie's life and what she has been doing since she left Kingsbridge, it also tells her side of Harold Fry's story as he is walking towards her. It is also story about dying and how we do that in our society. Queenie's friends in the Hospice are all wonderful, Finty, Barbara, Mr Henderson and the Pearly King. They may all be at death door but they are still doing their best to enjoy life and make the most of it. I especially liked Finty with her clourful hats and sense of fun.

You must live alongside your sorrow.\u201dI received an ARC copy of The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy from Netgalley without realizing that it was the second in a series and was completely unprepared for what I found in these two novels. If you haven't read The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, you should. In the first novel, Harold receives a letter from an old friend saying that she was dying of cancer and was writing to say goodbye. After conflicting emotions on what to say, Harold decides to walk across England to see her. The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy shows the other side of the story. After Queenie learns of Harold's pilgrimage, she begins to write him a letter revealing her secrets and all of the things that she feels she needs to tell him from their time of knowing each other. \u201cAll these years I thought a piece of my life was missing. But it was there all along. It was there when I sat beside you in your car and you began to drive. It was there when I sang backwards and you laughed or I made a picnic and you ate every crumb. It was there when you told me you liked my brown suit, when you opened the door for me, when you asked once if I would like to take the long road home. It came later in my garden. When I looked at the sun and saw it glow on my hands. When a rosebud appeared where there had not been one before. It was in the people who stopped and talked of this and that over the garden wall. And just when I thought my life was done, it came time and time again at the hospice. It has been everywhere, my happiness \u2013 when my mother sang for me to dance, when my father took my hand to keep me safe \u2013 but it was such a small, plain thing that I mistook it for something ordinary and failed to see. We expect our happiness to come with a sign and bells, but it doesn\u2019t.\u201d This story if filled with love, humor that will have you laughing out loud (literally), and undeniable sadness and beauty. You cannot help but to feel the pain and love of these characters.

Many of the discussions I had in person and online around the companion book The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry centred around the real feelings of Queenie towards Harold, the conclusions tending toward the book\u2019s theme being in part about that mystery and Harold\u2019s realisation that he would never know.So in some respects the appearance of this book blasted apart that theory. Very much a companion book the Love Song of Queenie Hennessey is written from the perspective of Queenie who is \u2018writing\u2019 letters to Harold from her Hospice bed. The narrative jumps between Queenie explaining the past and her experiences at the home. In general the prose is sharp and the book is well written with some genuine humour and heart-break at times.Nonetheless I did not actually appreciate this instalment of the tale. Hearing about Queenie\u2019s genuine love for Harold was mildly sweet, however destroyed the mysteries mentioned above (I don\u2019t know if others felt the same.) Stretching the story out to reveal a relationship between Queenie and Harold\u2019s son David just seemed contrived, especially the clich\u00e9 of Queenie being with David on the night of his death, conveniently structured to give Queenie the guilts without her actually being at all to blame.Overall the story lacked verve and tension \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if anyone would pick this up without having read The Unlikely Pilgrimage, but having nothing to encourage page turning but a scene we already saw, this time from Queenie\u2019s perspective the book dragged.I\u2019m sure extreme fans of the original book will be pretty into this book, for people like myself who enjoyed but was not overjoyed about Harold Fry I would hold it up as an example of a tale better left without a prequel/sequel/companion."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "[Bettie's Books (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Kaora", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora", "userReview": "There are so many things you still don't know.

We are shown the other side of the story and explains some of the events that Harold remembers in his tale. It is a powerful story of love and atonement and quickly had me in tears.The way the sudden removal of a person is a reminder of one's own fragility before we resume the familiar, ordinary things that make us feel untouchable again.Queenie has kept secrets for 20 years, and it was beautiful to watch her confess those and come to terms with things that had plagued her. Things that she had forced herself to pay penance for.

It takes place over the same timeframe as 'Harold' but is told from the point of view of the object of Harold's quest, the titular Queenie Hennessy.If you've read 'Harold' (and I would definitely recommend reading that book first, despite this not technically being a sequel) then you know the ultimate outcome of both books but believe me when I tell you that there are still some huge surprises in this companion novel that will initially make your head spin, followed by a feeling of 'Oh, but of course'.Of all the twists in this book, there was only one that I could honestly say I saw coming a mile away. The only other negative thing I can say about this book is that I didn't like the chapter titles. It's not that the chaper titles were bad chapter titles; it was more that this book is written as a series of letters from Queenie to Harold and I've never heard of anybody giving a personal letter a title before.Neither of these minor nit-picky negatives is enough to warrant docking this wonderful book a star, though. I loved this book just as much as I loved 'Harold'. It made me laugh, it made me cry. It is both deeply tragic and uplifting at the same time.

That story.. a very simple story of an ordinary man who undertakes a journey of 600 walking miles to say goodbye to an old friend spending her remaining days in a hospice\u2026 spoke to my heart in so many ways. When I discovered that Rachel Joyce had written a novel which would be a companion to Harold's story, I was filled with both excitement AND trepidation. I would only be disappointed by this book, right? In fact, I waited a couple of years to read the book, 'The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy' and I am far from being disappointed. Unlikely as it seemed to me when I began the novel, I ended up loving it even more!This book, which was written as occurring simultaneously with Harold's journey to Saint Bernadine's Hospice at Berwick-upon-Tweed, was written from Queenie's point of view; and when Queenie realized that her good-bye letter to Harold had inspired him to walk those hundreds of miles to see her in person, she was alarmed and frightened. Would she live long enough to see him again? Her tumor had, at this point, left her unable to speak. Plus, Queenie's fear had roots in the secrets she had been keeping for more than two decades. She knew in her heart that Harold needed to hear the secrets she had guarded so closely. In fact, she had moved away and left her entire life behind to guard those secrets. That had left her isolated and the only comfort she had found was in a garden she had constructed by the sea. You don't really need to read 'The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry' to understand and appreciate this book but I found that Queenie's story adds so much more depth to the characters; so I would recommend reading Harold's viewpoint first. I don't want to give too much of the story away so as not to spoil either book but I can express how much I loved this story and all of its characters. The hospice in which Queenie was spending her final days is a charming place.. not dreary or hopeless. In fact, the staff and patients seem as if they are a large family. The hospice is full of wonderful characters all simply living their lives one day at a time.. and savoring each day. There is Sister Lucy, a staff member, who is obsessed with jigsaw puzzles. There is always a puzzle under construction almost as if it has been placed there to encourage the patients.. after all, you don't want to give up your life until you have finished your business and have placed everything in order. And then, there is Sister Mary Inconnu. She is encouraging and helping Queenie to put the secrets she wants to tell Harold to paper, one word at a time. There is Mr. Henderson, Barbara, Finty and the Pearly King\u2026 all splendid characters , full of life, meeting each day to work on the puzzle and coaching each other to ingest the horrible protein shakes which are purported to taste like \"wet cardboard\". All of the patients are aware of Harold's journey and in fact, are following him on Twitter, even tweeting their own words of encouragement. Queenie is following Harold's journey as well.. through all of his stumbling and setbacks; and she is feverishly working through Sister Inconnu to tell her story. We learn of Queenie's early life, her parents and how much they cherished her, mistakes that she made and what led her to Kingsbridge where her life intersected with Harold's life. And this is where we discover her secrets\u2026 a secret which will most likely hurt Harold terribly because it pertains to his son, David. We learned about David in Harold's story but a big piece of this puzzle was missing\u2026 Queenie has those pieces. And this is where we learn of Queenie's feelings for Harold and why she suddenly disappeared from his life.. and HER life.. two decades earlier. Queenie had seen Harold not as average or ordinary but as an extraordinarily kind and gentle man\u2026 and she had fallen in love with him.But knowing that he was married, she had kept her feelings hidden and chosen to love him from afar. When finally Harold arrived at St. Bernadine's Hospice, it was clear that Harold in his usual way had not prepared for what he would find. And Queenie\u2026 well, she witnessed Harold's feelings play out across his face \u2026 \"Oh, and I saw it all, Harold. The look of shock. Horror and pity too. And the guilt that the sight of me aroused such feelings. You walked all that way and you believed I'd be pretty? I'm sorry, Harold for the way the truth lies.\" What was so apparent in this story is that Harold used the logic of his mind to see the world and the people in it; but Queenie saw the world with her heart\u2026 at least until that moment that changed everything for Harold. There are so many great themes in this book \u2026. that of guilt and the lies people tell to protect the people they love\u2026 memory and how fluid it can be and how it somehow softens around the edges over time\u2026 the challenges of viewing the world in just black and white, as Queenie said, \"People are rarely the straightforward things we think they are. Even the villains in a story can turn round and surprise us.\"\u2026.. and of course, there is the theme of unrequited love. Queenie's story ends just as you might expect it to end (and I don't believe this is a spoiler as she IS in a hospice); but before the story ends, Rachel Joyce (as she seems to often do) throws in an unexpected twist to the story.. a twist which, I admit, left me feeling stricken at first. Upon thinking about it, I realized that given what we learn of Harold and Queenie, the story probably couldn't have ended any other way. In the end, Queenie revealed herself and her secrets and looking back at her life, she felt a sense of peace and happiness after all. As she so beautifully stated, \"All these years, Harold, I have waited to tell you that I loved you. All these years I thought a piece of my life was missing. But it was there all along\u2026. it has been everywhere, my happiness- when my mother sang for me to dance, when my father took my hand to keep me safe-but it was such a small, plain thing that I mistook it for something ordinary and failed to see. We expect our happiness to come with a sign and bells but it doesn't . I loved you and you didn't know. I loved you and that was enough.\"It has been weeks since I finished reading this novel but sometimes I find myself thinking of Queenie Hennessy and when I do, I picture her sitting with the sun warming her face in the exquisite garden she created by the sea.. and it makes me smile."}], "description": "When Queenie Hennessy discovers that Harold Fry is walking the length of England to save her, and all she has to do is wait, she is shocked.

In confessing to secrets she has hidden for twenty years, she will find atonement for the past.
