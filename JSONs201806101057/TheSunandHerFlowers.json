Listen, as a Punjabi woman of course I gave Rupi a try - that's what we brown girls do, we hold each other up and support each other like crazy because who else will? However, I think we should also be able to speak up when the work just doesn't cut it. Being critical is simply tough love - so don't be so quick to dismiss my negative feeback.First of all, half of this book are one-liners from her first book, and most of her longer pieces felt lazy and ill-thought out. I found myself skipping/ losing interest through most of them. Furthermore, I just can't ignore the more popular pieces she has claimed as her own when any avid reader can tell you they are not. Example 1 : \"you must see no worth in yourselfif you find me worth lessafter you've touched meas if your hands on my bodymagnify youand reduce me to nothing\" - rupi kaursounds awfully familiar to my favorite quote by Kaija Sabbah:\u201cIf you consider a woman less pure after you\u2019ve touched hermaybe you should take a looks at your hands.\u201dExample 2: (This is from her first book) \"She was music, but he had his ears cut off\" - Rupi Kaur\"She was like a piano in a country where everyone has had their hands cut off.\" - Angela CarterExample 3:\"a manwho cries\"- rupi kaur\"i want more men with flowers falling from their skinmore water in their eyesmore tremble in their handsmore women in their heartsthan on their bodiesmore softness in their height more honesty in their voice more wonder more humility in their eyes.\"- Nayyirah WaheedThe pieces speaking about some of the hardest topics seem so surface level, I felt wrong reading it. I would never give this to my daughter. Not to mention the randomly sprinkled poems talking about her being an immigrant, all of them felt so out of place and awkward next to her other pieces. Anyways, I could go on and on about how much her work mirrors the work of lesser-known authors, but I think the smart readers already know this. As a Punjabi woman, I wish we were better represented. I feel let down and embarrassed by this author and would never recommend it to anyone. I can only hope she grows up one day and finally finds her voice."}, {"userName": "Hailey (HaileyinBookland)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21937982-hailey-haileyinbookland", "userReview": "*Thank you so much to Indigo for surprising me with a copy of this!*I never read Milk & Honey. It just seemed like such a fad thing, I had no interest in it. I tend to prefer traditional poetry. It's just my inner English major coming out I suppose! That being said, I enjoyed this more than I had expected. I didn't love the whole thing, but there were some poems that I really loved. The poetic style is quite simplistic and some quotes I felt like were reworded versions of things I've seen before.

Divided into five chapters and illustrated by Kaur,\u00a0the sun and her flowers\u00a0is a\u00a0vibrant and transcendent journey about growth and healing. Ancestry and honoring one\u2019s roots. Expatriation and rising up to find a home within yourself.Kaur's voice is as\u00a0audacious and brave as ever. She\u00a0nails to perfection\u00a0the\u00a0specific intimate details that made her writing so achingly real in milk and honey. We have poems exploring self-love, self-hate, body-image, girls supporting girls, motherly love, feminism, insecurity, sexual assault, and so much more. I read through it in a whirlwind. I barely\u00a0put it down, and it was so short I didn't even have to.The author's smart, poised, and down-to-earth writing oozes inspiration. And I'm beyond eager to share some of my favorite pieces: \n\nI'll never grow tired of reading Kaur's passionate words.

Let me say I had low expectations going into this, but I was so wrong. Backstory: I'm not a fan of milk & honey. It's not a style I enjoy at all, and the entire book just felt too Tumblr and cheesy and simplistic. this blew me away. it's so different, fresh, and jaw-dropping.it\u2019s interesting to see how her writing has grown and evolved. there are very few short poems (unlike m&h), which i was thankful for, because in m&h it seemed like she would just write sentences with skips in it, then label them poetry, and i really hated that style. however, this utilized a lot of longer poems and metaphor and personification of nature, and although it\u2019s still not my favorite style, it\u2019s gotten so much better. This book was just so much more personal. m&h felt like a ton of blanket statements and tumblr posts, but this one had quotes that actually made me sit back and go \u201cwhoa.\u201d\u201ci even tried to bury myself alivebut the dirt recoiledyou have already rotted it saidthere is nothing left for me to do- self-hate\u201dAMAZING.This book adds on an entire section about immigration and refugees, and I thought it was new and powerful as opposed to only talking about feminism, the body, and self-love. also, brown girls NEED to pick up this book. there is so much positivity and messages about acceptance of your skin. i will say, if you decide to pick this up, don't give up hope until you reach part 2. The whole first part seems like it was a step back from milk & honey? milk and honey was so feminist and focused on recovery and self-love and some of the poems in the first part were like \u201cTELL ME I\u2019M PRETTY I NEED VALIDATION\u201d and stuff like that and I was like ??????? It started out really weak but definitely got better.Lastly, another thing I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of is none of her poems use punctuation. She had some longer poems unlike anything she had in m&h, but most of those just employed really long-winded run-on sentences and I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of that style. Because of that, it was hard to tell sometimes when one poem ended and another begun because none were punctuated, some didn\u2019t have titles, some were just one sentence, etc. Regardless, I'm sorta speechless because I expected to hate this and I actually enjoyed it so much. Several of the poems gave me chills. If you gave up hope after milk & honey, definitely think about trying this from a library or something because it is a MAJOR improvement and I think its messages are valuable, and nothing about this feels like a regurgitation of a Tumblr post."}, {"userName": "C.G.

I would have been good had she stopped after 'and the bees growing jealous'. The last chunk of this poem just made me cringe and it also ruined the initial emotion I felt while reading the first half.---Next up buttercup:i envy the windswho still witness youBeen dur, done dat. How is this original? I bet Atticus would love this one. ---Please, Queen Latifah, give me da strength that I need to get carry on. Here we go again:you break women in like shoesYou know what? I've made a grave mistake in reading this. This isn't my preferred cup of tea.---The end is nigh:amanwho cries- a gift I came. I saw. I conquered. ---It's over, finished, done, finito, caput. Welp, that was definitely better than milk and honey. But in all honesty, none of her poems really left an impression on me. There were a few poems that I liked, but I've already forgotten them. Also, I thought this collection was meant to empower women? Majority of her poems came across as emotionally insecure and overly clich\u00e9d. Here is why I have a problem with her work: corresponding imagery is nice to look at once in a while, but I picked this up to be moved by her WORDS. If I wanted a picture book, then I'd go out and buy one. I found the artwork in this unnecessary, and I wasn't impressed with the stick people drawings.Also, I think modern poets tend to forget how impactful the use of punctuation can be for a reader. Create a tonality with your words and format your stanzas with stylistic elements. Unfortunately, this whole book was very dull and very monotone.It is nice to see a young Canadian poet establish herself--don't get me wrong! And my heart goes out to Ms. Kaur after reading about some of the horrific situations she underwent. That being said, I still think her work is overhyped and resembles little fluffs of nothing. If you enjoyed this then no hard feelings. But no more chances and no more modern poetry for me. I mean it. (that's probably a lie)*sings* Edgar Allan Poeeee sum sugaaa on meee.PS.

Her poetry is blooming. Her words hit home as they always do. I mean, there's a reason why there's a surge in poetry books being sold now. She's the reason. I love what she advocates in her poetry collections, what she stands for. How it is told in a format of stages, of growth. Following on from her previous collection (not that it is a sequel, but the format and themes are similar), the sun and her flowers is tackling the root of our own emotions and suffering, to taking it in and accepting the people around us, our ancestors and our heritage, our immigrant parents, to ultimately establishing self-love. Yes, you do come first. You are important. I feel like it's a mantra in her poetry and I love that. It's beyond empowering!As per her usual style, the poems are direct, simple, easy to grasp and full of passion. There are underlying layers and raw thoughts and emotions beneath those words that have me wanting to savour it, reread it. Annotate the whole book and find my own meaning within it.

STARS\n\n\nMe dio mas de lo que esperaba, m\u00e1s positivo, y sensible. No tan crudo como Honey and Milk, pero especial y hermoso. Una de las cosas que me fastidian de la poes\u00eda, es que la mayor\u00eda trate de enamorarse y corazones rotos. Y no quiero decir que en este libro no tengamos poemas sobre el amor y lo dif\u00edcil que es sobrellevar una relaci\u00f3n rom\u00e1ntica, pero con el estilo \u00fanico de Rupi, si me terminaron gustando. \n\n\"i learned everything is temporary. moments. feelings. people. flowers. i learned love is about giving. everything. and letting it hurt. i learned vulnerability is always the right choice because it is easy to be cold in a world that makes it so very difficult to remain soft. i learned.\"\n\nLo que diferencia este libro a los dem\u00e1s de poes\u00eda contempor\u00e1nea es que no se enfrasca en nada, toca temas muy variados.Inclusive tenemos un poema a las cejas, y es tan tierno que me hizo sonre\u00edr. El libro est\u00e1 separado en 5 diferentes temas, mi favorito fue rooting, creo que es el m\u00e1s intenso, toca el tema de los refugiados, la inmigraci\u00f3n con el que me sent\u00ed muy identificada.Los poemas m\u00e1s vehementes fueron todos donde nos habla de su madre, algunos son de esperanza, anhelo, inclusive hay uno sobre como ella dar\u00eda su vida con tal de cambiar lo que su madre tuvo que vivir.El poema m\u00e1s triste fue el de feminicidio de bebes, fue completamente shokeante porque nos gusta pensar que esto no pasa cerca de nosotros, que este tipo de cosas tan horribles pasan en pueblos lejanos, pero cuando dice que esto pasa aqu\u00ed en la ciudad donde vivo, a mujeres con las que me cruzo en la calle, no pude evitar derramar varias l\u00e1grimas.En conclusi\u00f3n: Si eres una mujer de color, seguro encontraras al menos un poema con el que te sentir\u00e1s completamente identificada, y si eres cualquier otra persona te recomiendo much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s que lo leas, ya que te permitir\u00e1 ver lo que una mujer que ha pasado por este tipo de situaciones siente y quiz\u00e1 logres ver la vida y el mundo en general desde otra perspectiva.

As a big fan of poetry I love to find new poets who inspire me and make me question my own view of the World. I enjoy reading poems that are hard hitting and don't shy away from the brutality of the World today. Rupi's poems in this her second book are written with love and from the heart. The offer a glimpse into the life Rupi has lead and the trials and tribulations she has gone through to get where she is today. You get the impression Rupi is still learning how to be a woman and an adult. She's still trying to find her place in the world. I love Rupi's style of poetry. It's simple yet also very beautiful. Rupi illustrates her poems with simplistic drawings that help to get her point across. This latest collection touches on sex, abuse, culture, religion, gender etc. The stand out poem is called Home. This poem is striking and quite frankly amazing. It's worth getting the book just for this poem alone. The use of description within this piece is just outstanding. A truly phenomenal piece of writing. Be warned Home is a brutal poem. It's not a pleasant read but it's a poem I believe every woman should read no matter what their circumstances are. Rupi has the ability to pack a hearty punch even when she is only writing a short poem. She has a clever knack of choosing just the right words to make the biggest impact possible. Reading this book makes you appreciate life. It makes you question the choices you make. It makes you sit up and take notice of subjects you might not normally read about.

A year ago, I read milk and honey and I was quite surprised of how personal, vulgar and relatable it was. But this book? I personally think it is better. \nLOVE. LOST. PAIN. PERSONAL DEMONS. GRIEF. TRAUMA. FEMINISM. SACRIFICE. HAPPINESS. REDEMPTION. RACE. MOVING ON. HAPPINESS.\nShe wrote poems about these issues and she successfully reached my heart and soul with every poem. I admire how straight- forward she is, with every word she uses; it was so moving and gut wrenching. Her writing is commendable because of how true, vulnerable, fragile, frank, and relatable it is. Her poems are direct and blunt. The writing style is simple yet gripping. As per the illustration, some of it were easily understood while the others kept me thinking because of the confusing way it was drawn. I personally think that the author wants the readers to conjure what the drawings mean.I'm excited for her next work, Rupi Kaur is one my favorite poet.

Her poems are relatable and exceptionally written. This collection is divided into five chapters depending on the topic. There's love, relationships, racism, grief, refugees, empowering women etc. and my personal favorite is about self-love. It's straightforward and successfully stirred my emotions. Here are my favorites in this collection:we need more lovenot from menbut ourselvesand each other- medicine-------------------------------------you are a mirrorif you continue to starve yourself of loveyou'll only meet people who'll starve you tooif you soak yourself in lovethe universe will hand you thosewho'll love you too- a simple math-------------------------------------it felt like you threw meso far from myselfi've been trying to find my way back ever since-------------------------------------.....let's find our own sun. grow our own flowers. the universe delivered us with the light and the seeds. we might not hear it at times but the music is always on. it just needs to be turned louder. for as long as there is breath in our lungs--we must keep dancing.

She's almost like a motivator or a therapist I can fit in my pocket and refer to when I need that extra boost or reminder that the sun indeed is still shining. Her poetry is both relateable and gentle and I'd happily recommend this one to everyone in a heartbeat. If you're a fan of Milk and Honey, you'll love The Sun and Her Flowers just as much, if not even more."}, {"userName": "Shannon Deveny", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32941037-shannon-deveny", "userReview": "I don't have the words to describe how impacted I am by \"The sun and her flowers.\" Completely overcome.
