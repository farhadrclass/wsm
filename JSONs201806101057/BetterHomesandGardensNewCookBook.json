It was the first cookbook I bought when I got my first apartment. I was poor and opted for the mass-market paperback version and over the past 30 years it has disintegrated. I recently decided to replace it with a fancy, shiny new spiral bound copy. It looks pretty and it's okay but in my opinion, it's not as good as my old one. Many of my favorite recipes are missing so it sits on the shelf. I take down my battered old faithful, held together with packing tape and a rubber band, and find the recipe I need. A classic!"}, {"userName": "Janine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51260-janine", "userReview": "Best cookbook for beginners.

For the last month I've been using it to hold down the lid of my dog's dry food container so she won't get into it because the latch is broken. I kept wanting this to be a good, useful go-to book like our old Good Housekeeping Illustrated Cookbook that we've had all my life (and that got used so much it's completely falling apart), but everytime I try to use this book I'm disappointed. It's got good ideas, but the recipes are NOT good imo. So finally, I'm tossing it, or more likely donating it to the Friend's of the Library."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/585676-wendy", "userReview": "I've found the majority of recipes in this new edition bland and flavorless, totally unlike my mom's edition from the late 60's. The low-fat, low-salt movement has taken its toll on this classic kitchen staple. For what it's worth, I cook with as little salt as I can get away with, but when you don't put any salt at all into a pie crust - eww.My suggestion is to search Goodwill or second-hand book stores for one of those earlier editions. You can always adjust the ingredients to suit a special diet.Also - whatever happened to the ingredient substitutions list that was in the back cover?"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/195320-jennifer", "userReview": "I don't know if perhaps it's me, but I there are a number of recipes in this book that I have had to tweak to make *ahem* BETTER. I am not a chef, but I do consider myself an amateur foodie of sorts. I had to adjust the muffin recipe (maybe I am just used to the super fabulousness of Gingerbread Muffin Company muffins, but anyways...), I had to work on the pizza dough recipe to get it to rise just so and become the correct consistency of pizza dough and not so crunchy at it kept turning out with their recipe...among other things. All in all, it is a good cook book and it has tons of hints and great recipes. The cinnamon buns are wonderful!"}, {"userName": "DeB MaRtEnS", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb-martens", "userReview": "I was going to purchase this cookbook for my son last year for his birthday, because my copy has our family favourite \"Hot Milk Sponge Cake\" recipe in it, a classic that Better Homes has had in its index since it began. To my surprise, I discovered that the recipe no longer was carried, since 2008! Pity, since it is super easy, can be doubled and is a moist and lovely cake better than any boxed mix.

It's not quite as good as having her in the kitchen with me, but the recipes remind me of childhood: 3-bean salad, cowboy coffee cake, corn chowder, snickerdoodles, spanish rice and all the candy and canning recipes My Mom has a knack for and I usually don't have the guts to try on my own. I love how they keep coming out with new versions of the \"New Cookbook\" and this version is extra special because of the section with \"All-Time Favorites\". It's like looking through some of My Mom's old editions.The thing about the book is that all the things it's really good to know are in there from how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon (3) to what to substitute if your recipe calls for baking powder and you happen to be out. The recipes are tried-and-true \"American Food\" and if you make one for a potluck it will get eaten. Especially \"Black Beans and Corn with Salsa Dressing.\""}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37816-erin", "userReview": "This is my go to book for baking, it has the best recipes for peanut butter cookies, ginger snaps, and fruit crisps. It also is a great cook book to have if you don't want to have 10 cook books (like I do) and it has enough of a variety to be your \"only\" cookbook, as these are tried and true recipes. The one downfall is that it doesn't have many ethnic or alternative (non-meat) recipes, so you'll have to go elsewhere for that."}, {"userName": "Margaret Prezioso-Frye", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20884038-margaret-prezioso-frye", "userReview": "My grandmother had one, my mother had one, my aunts had one (each), I had one - it was a traditional wedding present, my sister has one, sisters-in-law have one, I have one now, my daughter will have one again - she lost mine so that means the owner of the last house she lived in has one...Below it asks what the date is this book was finished being read - are you kidding - not for four generations that I know of yet."}, {"userName": "Lise Audet", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16413155-lise-audet", "userReview": "This cookbook is excellent for a beginner cook. It explains the basics. I also have to admit that I love my 1970 edition better than the newer version. These recipes remind you of good times spent with family and friends. For me they were the beginning of cooking on my own. I now have many cookbooks and have evolved in my culinary skills. Just like fashion in clothes, fashion in food evolves constantly.

The new book didn't have my old favorite recipes and to add insult to injury, the cover's rivets promptly fell out and the whole thing fell apart.

Not even close. There are very few recipes in this book that I have made more than once. For example, don't even bother with the banana muffins. They tasted like a big lump of baking soda. Way too salty and no flavor at all. I won't bother making them again. All in all, I don't recommend this one, particularly to beginner cooks.
