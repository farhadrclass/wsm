It is supposed to be the story of Maggie, a young Irish woman in 1912, about to travel on the ill-fated Titanic; simultaneously, it incorporates the story of Grace, her granddaughter in 1982. As far as I can tell, there is not much point to incorporating Grace into the story; Grace's father dies and she is having trouble moving on, Maggie's story helps her get off her ass, to be a little crass, but I really don't see the point of having Grace in the story besides having the reader catch up with Maggie 70 years later.Obviously, the story is about the Titanic. I've read my fair share of books about the Titanic, most of it from the POV of passengers in first class. This book offers a change in that the POV is from those in third class and a steward serving the third class cabins. The main character, Maggie, is a 17-year old woman leaving her sweetheart behind in Ireland to travel to a new life in America, along with 13 others in her little village. The book mainly describes her experiences and bewilderment on board the Titanic and her amazement even at the little things, since she has been so sheltered her entire life.I enjoyed the description of life in third class, but that was one of the few things I found enjoyable about this book. I got this book for free on Kindle, so I don't know if it is a formatting problem, but a good half of the book was in italics. Usually, the italics don't bother me; they delineate flashbacks. Now, this is a problem because HALF THE BOOK WAS IN ITALICS. Enough with the flashbacks of flashbacks of flashbacks already. The book takes place in 1912 and in 1982. There were flashbacks in 1912. There were flachbacks of 1982. There were multiple points of view, from a random sister of someone who happened to be the mother of someone else on the Titanic to a random aunt traveling along with them.I have no problems with flashbacks. I love getting more insight and details into the main characters' lives and thoughts. My main problem with the flashbacks in this book was that there were too many of them; I was not exaggerating when I say they literally take up half the novel. This would not be a problem if not for the fact that most of them were irrelevant and did not much contribute to the storyline. It's like in the middle of Maggie's tale, sudenly we get a glimpse of the life of a random fellow traveler who didn't really contribute anything and so who the hell cares?Furthermore, the author seriously needs a grammar checker. She also really needs to learn the use of a comma. Useful little thing, that."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4912929-rhonda", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. Anyone who is a history buff and likes Titanic will enjoy reading this book. The way it was written, with a few timelines and points of view was brilliant and refreshing! It really brings home the story of this tragic ship, passengers, crew members and families unlike anything I've read. It's a very good tribute to all those lost on that horrific night, 100 years ago.

They were filled with dreams, hopes and expectations. Sadly, only 3 would survive the sinking of the gigantic ship in the cold, dark Atlantic Ocean. The names of the 14 passengers, their life stories, the name of the Irish village and some other facts are changed in the Girl Who Came Home...but the story is obviously built on the true tale of 14 immigrants whose dreams were cut short by an iceberg.The story jumps back and forth in time from 1912 to 1982. In 1912, Maggie Murphy is 17 years old. Her mother has just died, and her aunt Kathleen travels from America to bring young Maggie home with her. She doesn't want to leave her love, Seamus, but she is drawn to the promise of a life in America and feels a duty to obey her aunt. She hopes Seamus will travel to America later to be with her. She misses him terribly while on board Titanic. The ship is massive and filled with more luxuries than the 14 hopeful Irish villagers have seen in their lives. They laugh, dance and joke about all the rich food...happy and delighted. Then late one night there is a slight bump and the engines go still. The night of horror has begun. In 1982, an 87-year old Maggie tells the story of that night to her great-granddaughter Grace. Grace needs to write a feature story for a Chicago newspaper and her great-grandmother decides it's time to tell someone her story. She has refused to talk about Titanic for decades, still feeling guilt that she survived and so many others died. In the attic there is a small suitcase that she carried with her the night of the sinking. She shares its contents with Grace, and the story about her memories of her life in Ireland, the voyage on Titanic and the aftermath of the sinking.The Girl Who Came Home is a lovely and sad story. It's well-written and emotional. I listened to the audiobook version....and I think hearing it read in a lovely Irish accent added more depth to the story for me. The audiobook is narrated by Connor Kelly-Eiding and Alana Kerr. They both read at a nice, even pace and are easily understandable. I have hearing loss, but was easily able to enjoy this audiobook with no problems. I normally don't like books that jump back and forth in time as it gets tedious and often confused, but Gaynor pulls it off. I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Beautiful, haunting and just lovely -- a great book! I will definitely be reading more by this author. I can't truly imagine what it must have been like for those on board the Titanic. For those in the lifeboats, hearing more than 1000 people screaming and dying in the cold water must have been heartbreaking. And for those in the water, it must have been horrific. Hazel Gaynor does a great job of depicting the joys of the lavish ship, the differences between steerage and the first class accomodations, the huge range of passengers aboard, the absolute horror of the sinking, and the depths of despair and loss felt afterwards. I think the most memorable part for me is towards the end....hundreds of family members waiting at the dock in New York in the pouring rain for hours. The Carpathia was due to dock, and it was carrying survivors.Some are happily reunited and others learn the final sad truth about the death of their loved ones. Very emotional scene. Gaynor is the author of several books including The Cottingley Secret and The Girl from the Savoy."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9420458-jennifer", "userReview": "What can I say about this book? It's not that I *disliked* it. I just felt that there was nothing particularly new or interesting here. I saw the \"big reveal\" from a mile away. This is not a book I would have chosen on my own, but it was the selection for one of my book clubs. I prefer books that either make me think or feel something. If I'm choosing something lighter, I tend to choose either humor or suspense/thriller. This is \"women's fiction\" through and through.

I'm sad to say this doesn't really add anything.This is a fictionalized event of fourteen people from a small Irish parish, most of whom lost their lives. The story is told through the eyes of one survivor, but her story isn't really told and the more modern story of her great-granddaughter, a young woman who makes her own drama and unhappiness, should have simply been left out. Grace, the granddaughter, didn't interest me as a character and every time the book shifted to her story I was irritated.The storytelling is very choppy, jumping from this character to that character and lots and lots and lots of telling instead of showing. Just when the story was getting exciting, it would stop and insert some other part of the story. There was no flow to the story. Since this is the story of a great loss of life, it might have been interesting to actually experience that, show us what that end might have looked like, contrast it with the survivor's story. That might have really improved the book.Also, only one family member who lost a loved one is actually described and that is only up to the time she finds the loss to be a reality. It might have been nice to know what more happened in her life, how this affected her, again, in comparison with the survivor.Speaking of the survivor, her story is never really told. The actual story of how she ends up with whom she ends up with is just glossed over, it all worked out we are told. Again, telling and not showing.If a reader knows absolutely nothing about Titanic, they might enjoy this book. Otherwise, maybe not.Overall, I didn't much care for it."}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "As another anniversary of the Titanic disaster approaches, I listened to this story of Maggie Murphy, a survivor who traveled with 13 others from Ballysheen, Ireland. Her adventures before, during, and after the fateful trip are mingled with a 1980's time frame in Illinois where her great granddaughter, Grace, is writing Maggie's story for the Chicago Tribune. I enjoyed both time frames, but the narrator with an Irish brogue for Maggie's parts was a real delight while Grace's was a little too matter of fact for me.It's hard to come up with something fresh when writing about the Titanic, and I did often picture Leonardo DiCaprio as the ship's steward, what with his mingling with the Irish lasses in steerage and all; but as the story continued and I saw where the author was going, it was hard to break away. Loved all the references to genealogical research.A little chick-lit-ish, but more comforting than annoying.Some might call the ending to Maggie's story sneaky or sly; it did annoy me a tiny bit until I gave it more thought and decided to cut the author some slack.Nicely done audiobook.3.5 stars rounded up."}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1595739-karla", "userReview": "I very much enjoyed this story line and loved that it was based on true facts, not just from the Titanic sinking, but the characters being based on real life characters as well. That being said, I could have, would have, enjoyed this novel much more had I not been frequently distracted by the writing style. There was a bit of redundancy, especially at the beginning and around the 3/4 mark. I prefer that the points be told efficiently the first time as apposed to having to retell the same point in multiple different ways to get the point across. I also am confused as to where Maggie actually lived, because it states that she lived with her Aunt but then it states that that same aunt lived in Chicago and returned to Ireland to bring Maggie to America. The names were also a distraction and since the author used fictitious names, why were Katie, Catherine, and Kathleen, chosen when they are so similar? There were many times when I was not bothered by distractions and at those times the author completely drew me in to the story. A bit more time tweaking on this novel and it could really be something. I have an opinion that it was most likely rushed to meet the deadline of the 100th Anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. Very enjoyable story."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1095633-melanie", "userReview": "I'm fascinated with the story of the Titanic, but not obsessed so I haven't read lots of books on it. This is a fictional account inspired by a real group of 14 Irish emigrants who left Ireland to visit relatives in America.The story focuses on 17-year-old Maggie Murphy. Maggie's parents have both died and her aunt Kathleen has come to Ireland and is taking Maggie back to Chicago with her. While there, others have decided to join them in making the journey. Maggie is sad to be leaving her boyfriend, Seamus, behind. His father is sick so he won't be able to come, but tells her he'll be waiting for her to come home. We also get two more stories: \"Lucky Harry,\" and Grace Butler, Maggie's great-granddaughter. Harry is one of the stewards on the ship who Maggie and her friends get to know and who later helps her get into one of the last lifeboats to leave. Grace's story takes place in Illinois in 1982. Grace's life was going well until her father died. She left college and her boyfriend, Jimmy, to help her mother. Maggie starts to help her get her life back, starting with telling her about her journey on the Titanic, a story she has never told anyone. Learning her great-grandmother's story gives Grace the courage to move on with her life.I loved this book! Most of it is told in flashback so there's a lot of jumping back and forth. I didn't find it to be confusing and actually liked it. Maggie was young and excited to go on the ship, but she was sad to have left Seamus behind. It was interesting to experience the Titanic through her young eyes. Knowing what happened doesn't lessen the impact of the scenes of the tragic night of April 15, 1912. All the talk of the Titanic being unsinkable appeared to have caused confusion and disbelief at what was happening. The author didn't dwell too long on the actual sinking and I liked that. The aftermath is what gets lost sometimes. The journey to the Carpathia in the lifeboats was long and cold. The people waiting to welcome the ship in New York were in shock as they attempted to learn the fate of their loved ones, and even if they didn't see their names on the list of survivors, hoped they would still see them disembark. It's not too surprising that Maggie didn't want to remember and discuss the horror of that night until she was much older.I also enjoyed Harry and Grace's stories. It was interesting to see what happened to Harry. I thought his ending would be a little different. Grace was able to learn what was important to her and to go for it before it was too late. I also loved Maggie's story and hearing the ending to it. She was able to do something at the end that she'd been wanting to do for a long time and was able to make peace with all that happened.I like the section at the end where the author shares the story behind the book and tells the parts of the book based on fact. There is also a short Glossary of Irish Terms and Reading Group Discussion Questions. There is a lot to say about this book so it would be great for a book club! This is a clean read. If you enjoy reading about the Titanic, this is a book for you!I received a copy of this book to review. My opinion is 100% my own.Mel's Shelves"}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane", "userReview": "Where I got the book: freebie on the Kindle.Note (1/25/15): this review is of the original self-published version. The novel was subsequently republished by William Morrow, and it's quite possible a lot of the problems I mentioned were fixed.This is a weak 3-star read, in my opinion. I was tempted to 2-star it, but I'm not going to do that for two reasons: it's a debut novel and therefore by definition not representative of the author's future development, and in some ways I rather enjoyed the story. I saw the twist in the tale coming a mile off, but it might come as a pleasant surprise to a less observant reader.Things I liked: a) the cover. Great cover. b) the fact that it was about steerage passengers instead of banging on about the rich and famous all the time c) to some extent, the 1980s story that's woven in with it. d) The author handles dialogue well when there is dialogue. e) Maggie, the Titanic-era heroine, seems real and ordinary (after my last Titanic read I'm feeling allergic to super-talented heroines). (The 1980s heroine, on the other hand, was a super-talented writer. Sigh. I need to start keeping count of the number of heroines or major supporting characters in debut novels who are super-talented writers, and they write ONE THING and everyone falls on their faces and goes \"we're not worthy, you're such a genius, have an important job in journalism\" and so on.)But I digress. My issue with this book can be summed up thus: the author seemed to take every opportunity to pull the reader out of the story and drop her into the Limbo of Annoyance. My status updates give my blow-by-blow opinions, but if you're a diehard reader (or especially if you're a writer) you'll recognize the symptoms: chunks of exposition, flashbacks, POV-hopping, and worse, easily checkable inaccuracies/anachronisms such as mentioning the Heimlich maneuver in the 1912 story.The text could have done with a proofread - it wasn't too bad, but there were quite a few grocer's apostrophes, especially in family names, and some homonym errors. I'm not going to carp about the that/which issue, because having grown up in England I know that rule isn't generally respected over there, but I want to point it out. All in all, editing at the developmental and final stages could have done a great deal for this novel. The writing got better toward the end (another trend I often note in debut novels, and another reason to edit the heck out of your MS once you've written The End).Finally, I'd like to give the author props for taking on the Titanic. It's not easy writing a story about an event that is well known to so many. I still haven't found the perfect Titanic novel, but writing about the steerage passengers is a good start if you ask me."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8198597-pam", "userReview": "This review contains spoilers in the second paragraph. Fans of romance novels might enjoy this book, but it wasn't what I was expecting and not my taste. As others have already said, nothing new was brought to the Titanic story and much of the plot followed the footsteps of the James Cameron movie. Long descriptive passages were often tedious and there was way too much repetition throughout the book. I found myself skimming entire paragraphs, which I almost never do. The worst part for me was the predictability. SPOILERS: I knew very early in the book that Seamus was James. I knew Grace would get back with Jimmy. I knew the letters would turn up after the article was published. I knew Peggy would somehow survive. I knew the news article was going to be the greatest story ever written. I knew Maggie would die at the end. I even knew why Maggie liked to arrange the cookies on the plate before it was revealed. It made me wonder how Grace could be so dense. The two main characters were too virtuous and perfect to engage me. The poor people had no flaws; the rich people had no virtues. The plot was too neat and pretty and all the loose ends were tied up at the end with pretty strings that were intended to tug at your heart. As far as romance novels go, this one is relatively well-written, but not my cup of tea. Maybe it will make a successful Lifetime movie."}, {"userName": "Lady Reads", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5340948-lady-reads", "userReview": "I must say, before I begin to describe my experience with this story, that I liked it and was charmed by its simplicity. It was innocent and sweeping, an easy warm weather read.This book has its problems. The names of many of the characters are confusing in their similarity and origin, so it can be hard to decipher who the author is talking about. There are grammar/punctuation errors which may cause a reader to review a sentence once or twice to really decipher the meaning.Still, I feel all of those hindrances can be overlooked. This is both Maggie Murphy's story of leaving her Irish lover behind, adapting to being a 'third class' passenger on a luxury liner, and surviving the Titanic's disaster as well as her great grand-daughter's story of spiritual rebirth. A reader gets to see both women come to accept their personal tragedies as a stepping stone to happy, fulfilled lives.My favorite thing about this book was not the rich description of Irish life, the authentic portrayal of class inequality, or the lingering injustice of all those travelers' deaths but that, after so much struggle and heartbreak, a happy ending is given to both the leading female characters and us readers."}, {"userName": "Mauoijenn ~ *Mouthy Jenn* ~", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2569271-mauoijenn-mouthy-jenn", "userReview": "Well this was a let down.

As I was reading, I felt like I was the silly girl running through the halls giggling with them. And when the unthinkable happened, I felt the fear in Maggie, the heartbreak, the loss.

There were conflicting lists of survivors with many passengers in shock or suffering from hypothermia, and unable to communicate. The heartbroken survivors faced life in a new country without their loved ones who had perished in the disaster.The novel was composed of regular chapters, journal entries, letters, and telegrams.

I guess I read her books in reverse order, starting with her most recent, The Cottingley Secret, followed by A Memory of Violets, and finally, The Girl Who Came Home: A Novel of the Titanic. The novel opens as Maggie Murphy of Ballysheen, County Mayo in Ireland is preparing to join her aunt and twelve other friends from this small Irish community to travel on the maiden voyage of the supposedly \u201cunsinkable\u201d Titanic in search of new lives in America. Maggie is grieving over the recent loss of her mother and the impending separation. From her boyfriend Seamus Doyle who is reluctant to leave his ailing father and join his beloved girlfriend on the journey. The reader is transported to this tiny little hamlet, sharing the hopes and dreams of those who are departing along with the fears and grief of those left behind. We follow the travelers on their journey and experience their excitement as they savor the ship and all of its glamor and beauty. The suspense as the reader drinks in every page is palpable, knowing the inevitable outcome, wondering who will live and who won\u2019t. As one experiences the challenges of the fight for survival, the fear and hopelessness permeates through the pages. I couldn\u2019t put it down during the sections devoted to the actual disaster, which comes alive through the perspectives of the characters.Seventy years later, college student Grace Butler is trying to figure out the direction her life will go after the death of her father. She learns that her great grandmother Maggie is a survivor of the Titanic disaster and as Maggie shares more and more of her difficult past, Grace finds renewed purpose in determining her own future. Grace helps her great grandmother put the pieces of her past together and achieve a sense of peace that she lost so many years ago. Both women, separated by three generations are united in their quest to uncover the past and direct their futures. Some surprises for the readers are revealed towards the end of the book, which bring it to a satisfying conclusion I really loved this book, and after reading three books by this author, I really need to visit Ireland and see its beauty for myself. The descriptions are vivid and the scenes fly off the pages. The characters are emotional and sympathetic and realistically portrayed. The reader feels the fear and hopelessness, the panic and struggle of the doomed and those left behind. This was another memorable read by Hazel Gaynor, who has become one of my favorite authors (along with Kristin Hannah). Highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "\u0130nci Puyan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12964769-nci-puyan", "userReview": "http://illekitap.blogspot.com.tr/2018...Veee Arkadya Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, bence \u00e7ok fena vurgun yap\u0131p efsanevi gemi Titanik'in hikayesine dokunu\u015f yapt\u0131.

When the unsinkable ship met its match when it encountered an iceberg despite the many warnings of sightings in the area and yet they failed to reduced their speed and tempted fate. So many mistakes and so many to blame, but what we fail sometimes to remember is that people did survive despite the odds from both first class passengers to steerage and even a handful of dogs, while even more lost their lives from babies to older couples in the prime of life. For those that did survive, they have passed along their stories of what it was like that fateful night, when so many had left their homes in search of a better life in America but never reached it. Those that kept that night long buried in their memory never wanting to talk about it to even their close family and friends. If you think about it now, there are no survivors left from that night. They have all died but their stories live on in the lives of those they did share their secrets with. In the novel, The Girl Who Came Home by Hazel Gaynor, she takes a different spin on all the other novels that have been written choosing instead to focus on handful that survived among a group of fourteen that left Ireland for better opportunities each personal in their own way. It is based on fact but then filled in with some fiction as filler but the story remains the same. People struggled to survive from all social classes and on that night it was literally everyone for themselves. The reader is introduced to Maggie Murphy who is leaving Ireland despite her wishes to find new hope in America with her Aunt Kathleen. Kathleen has agreed to take a group of Irish immigrants to America if they can secure a ticket. She will make sure they all arrive as promised. For Maggie, she is leaving behind more than just her childhood home, she is leaving behind the one man she had hoped to marry, Seamus Doyle. They agree to write one another as much as they can, but Seamus believes that Maggie will return home to him one day when she is older. He vows to wait for her, despite not being able to accompany her on this trip because of his ailing father. He only hopes the pack of letters he has written her, one for every month they have been in love, will help to pass the time for Maggie. Neither of them could ever imagine how this trip would end for either one. The novel toggles between various characters from Maggie's journal she writes in to pass her time on the ship, to their steward Harry Walsh who has fallen for one of Maggie's friends on board, Peggy Madden who wishes to be married to a wealthy man and thus raise herself in the social class but for now has to settle for her lot in life. Grace Butler is Maggie's great granddaughter who also tells her story of what learning about survival means to her moving forward in her own life, leaving behind a man she loved to care for her father. Maggie and Grace soon learn that life is too precious to waste and thus must be embraced every single day. I received The Girl Who Came Home by Hazel Gaynor compliments of William Morrow, a division of Harper Collins Publishers for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed in this review are strictly my own. I've been a huge fan of the Titanic for quite some time and LOVE reading everything from fictional based novels to non fiction about the lives that were forever changed that night. This one tells the survival story of how a third class steerage passenger was able to live to tell her tale and how it changed how she moved forward in the remaining years of her life in America. The novel also uses the authentic Marconi messages from the Titanic and Carpathia to begin each section of the book. There is a section at the end where the author provides the factual information she obtains as the basis for her novel and a reader discussion guide as well. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion."}, {"userName": "MissSusie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2669943-misssusie", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book; the author did a great job of mixing the Titanic story with the present day story.I found it fascinating to read about this group of 14 people from one little town of Ballysheen Ireland it was a fictional town (but there was a real town Addergoole that had 14 people on the Titanic and lost 11 people) which made me want to do even more research on them. Also I loved the pictures of the real cables and telegrams from the titanic and the Carpathia interspersed in the book.Maggie was a great character she was strong willed and a survivor, this book really made you feel how terrifying it was and how lucky it was that anyone at all from 3rd class survived that awful night. I found it interesting that Maggie had never spoken to her family of her time on the Titanic and it made me wonder how many other survivors never spoke of it again. We all know the story of the titanic and I have read many books on the subject myself but when Maggie is talking to Grace and says she never talked about it because even this many years later she can still hear the screams of the people in the water and as the ship went down, how awful to live with that the rest of your life.I also enjoyed the love story of Maggie & Seamus, if you follow my reviews you know I\u2019m not much into romance but this love story was so sweet and the way Maggie told the story just made me want them to make it.Maggie\u2019s granddaughter Grace was so different than Maggie I felt she was weaker because look at what Maggie had been through, when all but herself and one other that were traveling on the titanic were lost to the sea but she went on with her life but Grace loses her father and completely falls apart and gives up everything she loves to take care of her mother but really I felt it was more about Grace herself than taking care of her mother, it was her way to hide.All the characters on the boat were well written and I really felt the author did a great job of putting you in their shoes, even though you as a reader know what will happen it was still edge of your seat hoping your favorite characters make it to the life boats.Make sure you read the acknowledgments and the PS to learn more about the real town and where the author got the ideas for this book I found that interesting.I truly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any historical fiction fans out there.4 StarsI received this book from the LibraryThing Early Reviewers Program for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Margaret Madden", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21224317-margaret-madden", "userReview": "Review from BleachHouseLibrary.Blogspot.ie I received a copy of this book from the publishers for review purposes......It is 102 years since the tragic sinking of Titanic and yet the story is one that never fails to pull at our heartstrings. We have seen the movie, read the books and think there is nothing else we can learn about the event. This book proves us wrong.Based on the true story of a group of people, all from the same small country town in Ireland, who travelled on Titanic in search of a better life. Only two survived. This is the story of the fourteen neighbours, their excitement, their nervousness, their awe of such a fine vessel and their limited interaction with the wealthier passengers on-board. The story is split in two; Maggie Murphy is one of the fourteen who travelled to America in 1912 and the reader learns of her harrowing tale from her journal entries as well as flashbacks. Grace Bulter is Maggie's great-granddaughter and is the one that Maggie chooses to share her memories with.The novel is written with great compassion and was obviously lovingly researched. Hazel Gaynor has looked at the tragedy from a different angle but has retained essential facts surrounding the ship and it's, now famous, passengers. A few details in the book were not ones I had known, little nuggets of information that are peppered throughout the chapters and added to the overall atmosphere. There is a look at what it was like for the family and friends, on land, who were desperately waiting for updates on the event and wondering if their loved ones were among the survivors. Even when disembarking in New York, following their rescue, the divide between classes was still obvious. Even in tragedy, status was everything. The writing is warm and affectionate to its subject as well as having a nice overall pace and chapter length. I would think it ideal for older children as well as adults and would work especially well for reading groups as there is a great section at the end of the book for further discussion. A special mention for the beautiful artwork of the cover too!I live close to the Titanic Museum, in Belfast, and have been itching to visit for the past two years. I think this novel has given me the final push I needed. I intend to visit in the very near future. Thanks to Hazel Gaynor for her research and dedication in the completion of this lovely book.

I particularly liked that it was based on a specific group of real-life travellers all from the same Irish village - this is a common theme in emigration (the English village I study for genealogical purposes had 24 people emigrate together on a ship bound for New South Wales in 1848) and I was pleased that the author had chosen to base her Titanic novel around this. The concept and story of Titanic itself can overwhelm novels, but here the dual storylines of 1912 and 1982 enhanced the more personal feel.There were however some flaws. Some sections felt a bit repetitive - in particular so many bad omens about the voyage being seen by all and sundry, and the ship seemingly never being mentioned without a song and dance about how big and magnificent it was. I think a more subtle approach to these would have worked better. There were also some anachronisms (Grace wouldn\u2019t have had Bryan Adams and Bon Jovi posters on her wall when she headed off to college in 1979).Some further editing would likely improve this book, but overall I definitely enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Nenette", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156661-nenette", "userReview": "There are a number of things that I love about this book:Fictional stories based on facts are nice reads especially when the writer\u2019s creativity is used such that the facts are not addled but rather enhanced by the fictional twists and turns. More than a couple of scenes made me cry. I wouldn\u2019t say the prose came off as heavy, it\u2019s actually the contrary for me, but the book pulled at my heart. A good cry is a good cry, and I loved it!There is a lovely parallelism of stories between Titanic survivor Maggie with that of her great-granddaughter Grace. The lessons and wisdom of old age is seen to be very much at work in the circumstances of the lives of the young.I love the snippets of actual Marconigrams (telegrams sent through the Marconi Company) sent between Titanic and Carpathia, between Carpathia and the White Star Line offices. Titanic, both as a ship and as a symbol, encompasses a wide range of topics: subdivisions in society, human feelings and emotions, history, etc. A lot of stories have been made about the majestic but doomed ship, and I think this is one of the best."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10031062-krista", "userReview": "I loved this historical fiction story centered around a Titanic survivor.
