Bale's two young sons are also present, enjoying the thrill of skating.One of the boys falls but he emits a piercing scream and it transpires that there is a dead body embedded in the ice. Who is it? Has he simply fell in and drowned or is there foul play involved?The death turns out to be murder and in due course Christopher Redmayne's brother, Henry, is arrested and imprisoned for the crime. Christopher does not believe he committed the murder and sets out to prove his innocence with the help of Bale, who initially does not share his friend's convictions as to Henry's innocence.They tramp around 17th century London, which is captured in great detail, and a number of suspects crop up but nothing can be proved against them. Romance is also in the air for Christopher and he is pursued by a couple of prospective paramours.After much excitement, one or two close calls for Christopher and a series of lectures by the Redmayne's father, the Dean of Gloucester, the perpetrator of the crime is eventually uncovered, Henry is freed and the architect is free to sort out his love affairs, which he does successfully."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14631983-caroline", "userReview": "Couldn't put it down. Read the first six chapters last night and finished the book today. I love the main characters of Christopher Redmayne and Jonathan Bale. They're two such different characters, yet they seem to complement each other so well. Redmayne's fairly secular outlook on life seems to temper Jonathan Bale's Puritanical views of \"no more cakes and ale\". Henry Redmayne, Christopher's reprobate older brother, is still causing problems not only for his brother, but also by being a disappointment to their father, the Dean of Gloucester, the Reverand Algernon Redmayne. A thoroughly intriguimg story and one I was sorry to reach the end of. A wonderful historical setting, three years after the Great Fire of London."}, {"userName": "LemontreeLime", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1532930-lemontreelime", "userReview": "Such a good series, I love this wide combination of characters in restoration England."}, {"userName": "Robert Hepple", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29831899-robert-hepple", "userReview": "The Frost Fair, first published in 2002, is a routine murder mystery set in London in 1669 at the time of a historically cold winter that froze the Thames over. It forms part of a series featuring the architect Christopher Redmayne. Whilst the mystery element is routine and lightweight, this is made up for by some excellent character development and character interaction - most enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Jules Jones", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10074986-jules-jones", "userReview": "I bought this because it was by the same author as the Railway Detective series, which I'd found enjoyable at the \"read once\" level. This is the fourth in the Restoration series, a mystery series about architect Christopher Redmayne and constable Jonathan Bale, set in Restoration London in the years following the Great Fire of 1666. I haven't previously read any in this series, but found that this worked well as a standalone, with enough backstory worked in to be able to follow who people were.[return][return]A naked corpse is found frozen into the sheet of ice that has covered the Thames, and the most obvious suspect is Christopher's rake of a brother, who wakes up after a drunken night to find himself arrested and flung into Newgate. Christopher is convinced of his brother's innocence, not just out of filial loyalty but because he is only too aware of his brother's vices -- and violence is not among them. His friend Jonathan, on the other hand, is convinced of Henry's guilt, and not just because the Puritan Jonathan disapproves of Henry's lifestyle. The evidence at the scene is all too damning. But both men feel that justice will not be done unless the matter is properly investigated. And investigate they do, following parallel lines of enquiry and sharing their information. Along the way there's some excellent world-building about the re-building of the world of London after the Great Fire. I don't know the period well enough to say how accurate it is, but Marston has created an enjoyable picture of a culture that is both alien and familiar. [return][return]I think I like this one a little better than I did the Railway Detective series, possibly because rather than in spite of coming in part way through the series -- there's far less overt info-dumping in this one than in the first Railway Detective book I read. I'd be happy to read more of these, although I'm not going to rush out looking for them; in part because a quick look at the blurbs on the author's website suggests there is very little character arc development through the series for the continuing characters and their lives outside the mystery-solving, something I found rather frustrating in the Railway Detective books."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5192248-matt", "userReview": "Continuing the story of Christopher Redmayne (this is actually the book that comes prior to the Parliment House I read earlier this year), this book delves into some family dynamics as we are introduced to his pleasure seeking brother who is accused of murdering a fencing master. London politics are slightly explored with discussions on the right of the King, the role and rights of forgieners, however Marston masterfully slips small details into the story without making them feel preachy or overbearing. Instead he is able to weave comments on politics, social castes, and historical details without drowning the story in details that so often drag and slow a story. The continuing saga of Christohper's love for Susan is interesting as we learn the nuances of love and courtship in the late 1600's.All told I found this book to be an easy read, something that many historical dramas cannot claim, enjoyable and engaging. Edward Marston manages to make a historical dramatic mystery that is a wonder to read, and makes you want to continue to the next book wondering if Christopher will ever manage to prove himself to Susan's family and spend a happy life with her as his wife.I highly recommend this entire series, having read the first two books available in America I can say this is one of the most enjoyable series I have read."}, {"userName": "Karen Brooks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2382210-karen-brooks", "userReview": "The Frost Fair is the fourth book in the Christopher Redmayne series by Edward Marston and, so far, the one I have most enjoyed. Featuring the usual characters: the earnest, reliable and lovable architect, Christopher, the loyal, hard-working and taciturn Puritan constable, Jonathan Bale as well as Christopher's family and his new love interest, the story turns on a body found beneath the frozen Thames during a Frost Fair. The man is identified as an Italian fencing instructor, who has managed to alienate a group of London gentleman, including, it turns out Christopher's brother. When Henry Redmayne's knife is found in the man's back and Henry is arrested and thrown into Newgate charged with his death, Christopher and Jonathan must use all their wiles and connections to uncover the killer.As usual, there are marvellous side-plots and extraneous characters only in this book, I felt they served the primary story in ways perhaps previous ones hadn't, enriching the primary narrative and making it quite riveting.I love the way Marston captures any era he is writing in and this is no exception. Looking forward to the next book."}, {"userName": "Rosie Read", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19860864-rosie-read", "userReview": "An unwanted book passed on to me by my father, 'The Frost Fair' definitely isn't my usual type. While I love a good crime novel this sedate little mystery was a bit different. I throughly enjoyed the setting of the novel, just three years after the Great Fire of London when London was undergoing one of its biggest shifts. The novel is peppered with enough historical detail to keep you firmly planted in the 17th century, however this is almost always superficial with very little depth. I was most disappointed to find that the frost fair, a spontaneous event that took place when the Thames froze over, got little attention. All the characters are easily likeable and Christopher and Jonathan make a good foil for one another. I do wonder what made the author plump for an amateur sleuth in the guise of an architect, but it does work well given the period. The novel was a little slower than I'm used to but it was an enjoyable little mystery nevertheless. While I might not read another of this series I am intrigued to try the Victorian or Home Front series that the author has also penned."}, {"userName": "Sidney", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1842024-sidney", "userReview": "I read about this novel in the Rough Guide to Crime Fiction and was intrigued by its use of a frost fair, events held spontaneously in London over many years when the Thames froze. The frost fair is well realized, but only one chapter is devoted to it as the story's beginning. The mystery takes off from there readily, however. Architect Christopher Redmayne's brother proves to be the acquaintance of the Italian fencing master found frozen in the ice, and the sibling's soon locked up in Newgate prison, leaving Redmayne to find the real culprit. It's a challenging quest that requires the help of Redmayne's constable friend, Jonathan Bale. London society's restrictions hamper the investigation and challenge Redmayne's relationships both professional and romantic, but he doggedly pursues the truth, working his way through suspects, dual identities and political intrigue. I found this to be an engaging adventure with a dash of sword play, some surprises and interesting relationships. I plan to read more in the Redmayne series."}, {"userName": "Wayne Farmer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7418417-wayne-farmer", "userReview": "Another enjoyable read in the Christopher Redmayne series, however for the first time this loses a star. The reason for this is that I found the circumstances all a bit too contrived and over-coincidental - Firstly it is Jonathan Bale's son who finds the corpse and then it is his friend Christopher's brother Henry who is the main suspect in the murder, and this follows on from the previous book where Henry was also in the thick of the murderous plot. While I can allow that Henry's lifestyle is so debauched that he is mixing with the sorts of people that do bad things I felt it really didn't need to be Jonathan's boy that found the corpse-it was one coincidence too far. However, as usual, the stories setting and historical background were fascinating and I loved hearing a little information on the Frost Fair which is something that has always fired my imagination. The mystery itself worked well and just when I thought my suspicions were about to become fact I got proven wrong on the instigator."}, {"userName": "Frostling", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175734-frostling", "userReview": "Murder mystery set in 1669. The brother of architect Christopher Redmayne is accused of having murdered an Italian fencing teacher. Follows a dull investigation (as the same people are visited over and over again) led by Christopher and his friend, Constable Jonathan Bale.This is a book I wished I had not touched. Too many details are told and not shown, robbing the readers of the historical atmosphere of London after the Great Fire. It is also let down considerably by numerous spelling mistakes creeping up everywhere.

The city is less a character than in Shardlake or Stephenson's Baroque Cycle - this focuses on the team of an architect and a Puritan constable. I appreciated the positively portrayed Puritan (probably why it gets three stars), but the entire story felt a bit constrained in its narrow circle of operation. It lacked the depth of other historical novels (like those noted above) and the dialogue was wooden and overdone. The main characters were likable, but the other characters were cardboard."}, {"userName": "Cat.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9225099-cat", "userReview": "This is a volume in Marston's series that follows Henry Redmayne, architect, who is helping to rebuild London just after the Great Fire (in 1666).
