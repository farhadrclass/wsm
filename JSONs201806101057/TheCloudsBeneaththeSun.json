Unfortunately, the melodramatic, soap opera ending dropped that down a star, all the more disappointing to me because I thought the book had great potential.A freshly-minted archaeologist, Natalie Nelson, is on her first dig in 1961 Kenya, digging on the land traditionally owned by the Masai people. The country is on the verge of gaining its independence. Two of the archaeologists do something terribly disrespectful in the eyes of the Masai, only so that they can speed the publication of their discoveries. There is a murder, and Natalie is caught in the middle of it. Battle lines are drawn between those who believe in British law and those who think tribal law should be upheld. Racism and politics are strong on both sides.So far, so good, right? No, afraid not. None of the main characters are very likeable, which I can deal with if the story is good. I'll stick with my opinions of Natalie because she is the protagonist. She is obsessed with her married lover, who dumped her, and for the first half or so, barely a page goes by without mention of Dominic. She has turned her back on her Christian upbringing but then is critical of the Masai when they don't follow Christian doctrines. She apparently doesn't see much wrong with having a married lover, at least not he ran away from her, but is appalled that a Masai woman would agree to be a third wife. The romance in the book seems forced and not very realistic. You have a couple of shots of whiskey with a guy, know him for a few days, and it's love ever after? The only reason Dominic was mentioned less as the book went on is because other love interests and potential love interests took his place. Natalie's thoughts felt like they were written by a man assuming what a woman would feel, not written as a woman really would feel. You are saved from stampeding wildebeests and a crocodile, and all you think of after is how your breasts were fondled during the rescue? Give me a break.What I did love about the book was the African setting and the bits about archeology. Reading about the animals was great, even though a couple of parts were very sad. The author made the settings easy to visualize. I would have liked more historical information about Kenya's independence.A blurb about the book is \u201can irresistible page-turner of forbidden love on the wild plains of East Africa.\u201d Normally, phrases like \u201cforbidden love\u201d make me run in the other direction, and should have this time.A copy of this book was provided to me for review."}, {"userName": "Rachelfm", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1299389-rachelfm", "userReview": "1.

The premise was so good - on the verge of Kenyan independence, the claustrophobic environment of a dig in the middle of Masai burial grounds, an attractive young female doctor in the middle - but it just didn't deliver at all. I'm assuming Mackenzie Ford is a man - well, whatever, he certainly didn't get inside the head or heart of Natalie.

The author had great descriptions of life on an archaeological dig site in the African bush - clearly he was writing from his own experience as an archaelogist. That part was fascinating, and I really felt like I got a good picture of the land and the Maasai culture. Having spent a very little time in Africa, I really enjoyed this aspect. However, the book was ultimately overdone, WAY too long and a bit repetitive. The heroine, Natalie Nelson, was interesting and strong-willed and struggling with an interesting moral dilemma - which I won't give away since it is a big part of the storyline - but pretty one-dimensional. Blah, Blah, Blah about her difficult break-up and family dramas. If I had to read one more instance where the her throat began to sweat due to nervous tension...AAARGH. The romance between Nelson and the one of the men on the dig was entirely predictable, sort of cheesy dashing hero and nervous maiden stuff. HOWEVER, I did enjoy the book and would recommend it, with some reservations."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119675-sara", "userReview": "I thought long and hard before giving this book a 4-star rating. This is another of the books sent to me as a first-reads winner, and I must say I always get something interesting that I might not have picked up on my own. This book is no exception.The story is set in Kenya prior to independence, taking place over a period of months in late 1961 and early 1962. It revolves around Dr. Natalie Nelson and a family that loosely resembles the Leakeys, who made many dramatic paleontological discoveries in the Rift Valley. A dramatic discovery of the first hominid to walk upright starts the story. The men involved in the discovery raid a Maasai graveyard for contemporary bones with which to compare the find. Subsequently, one of the men is found murdered. Dr. Nelson believes she saw the perpetrator on his way to commit the crime. The story proceeds from there, complete with tribal issues, comparisons of African and western justice, Dr. Nelson's, determination to tell her story in court despite pressure from all sides not to do so, and the requisite, if somewhat understated, romance. This is a very complex story, and it took some time to begin keeping all of the characters straight in my mind and begin to understand their issues and motivations. The Deacon family dynamic is at the heart of the story, especially the rivalries between two brothers, Christopher and Jack, both of whom are more than a little interested in Dr. Nelson. As is just about every white man in the story. Dr. Nelson is recovering from the end of an affair and the death of her mother, along with an estrangement from her father. She comes across as a very intelligent and highly principled young woman, though unsure about her future. The complexity weaves its way along, and I confess I was never bored. Mackenzie Ford does a great job of explaining basic principles of paleontology, along with capturing some of the tension in pre-independence Kenya. Most of his characters are compelling and their motivations are clear. However, I think he failed to truly capture Jack Deacon, harping on his desire to marry and have children, when indeed I believe he was a much more complicated man.The ending comes up rather suddenly and unpredictably, despite some very clear seeds for it being sown during the course of the book. Without giving it away, let's just say it isn't a happy ending by any stretch of the imagination. Some of Mr. Ford's writing would benefit from additional editing. One thing that drives me insane is when an author seemingly can't make up his or her mind about which word best suits his descriptions, so he throws in all of them just to be sure the reader \"gets\" it. There were two instances of this on the first page, which almost made me put the book down. \"Natalie was weary--no, she was drained, exhausted, spent. . . and, . . .she had left Cambridge sometime yesterday, and she was anxious, longing, desperate to reach Kihara camp. Really, make up your mind and tighten the writing. I gave this 4 stars because frankly, once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. It was a good read, and I relish complexity in a story. Too many these days seem to be just a one note harping. This book is well worth the effort. I learned quite a bit about an area, paleontology, where I know very little. And that goes for Africa, too."}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8635890-tamara", "userReview": "[had the potential to be an interesting character (a sheltered twenty something experiencing the world for the first time and realizing the scope and scale of its complexities. But as the book went on, she just became increasingly unlikeable and unrealistic. As other reviewers have suggested, she's a female character written as a man might expect a woman to think and act (i.e. rescued time after time by the male hero and increasingly aroused in these inappropriate rescue scenarios). And, for a book filled with characters with seemingly complex histories and motivations, the author puts Natalie on a pedestal, which is particularly problematic.Mackenzie Ford tells the reader that Natalie is beautiful, brilliant and broken, making her impossibly attractive to all of the (straight) men she encounters in Kenya. Three different men fall in love with her having barely interacted with her. She has a clear moral compass and is strong and determined. However, what he shows in her behaviour, and in the interactions of other characters with her contradicts the character he tells us Natalie is. Beyond the love interests fawning at her every move, Eleanor Deacon, woman-in-charge, and experienced academic, bends her rules at Natalie's urgings, because Natalie makes her see the errors in her ways. Kees confides his deepest secret to her, because she is perfectly trustworthy. In short, Natalie's interactions with all of the other characters destroys the credibility of those other characters, because they adore her so much they change their behaviour to align with her amazingness. The author seemed to want so badly for the reader to like and empathize with Natalie that he forgot to make her likeable.

It had a decent start, introducing us to Natalie, a young woman beginning in the archeology world, suffering a broken heart (of which we heard WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT) and dealing with grief over her recently deceased mother. She goes to join a dig in Africa and we meet some not all that likeable characters. Russel, a Californian Aussie that immediately falls in love with Natalie. Eleanor, an incredibly bossy, prying, controlling know it all. Christopher, the know it all's son who also falls in love with Natalie. Richard who barely resides long enough for me to mention him. And later, Jack, another son of know it all who naturally, falls in love with Natalie. Despite the constant mentioning of her former lover, Dominic, I enjoyed the dig finds, the murder itself and the antics leading up to it, and most of all, I enjoyed the tidbits about the African flora, fawna, and animals. But soon, the story began to go like this: Natalie receives a letter from Russell (who is no longer on the team but after having had a few whiskeys with Natalie, thinks they have something special), Eleanor attempts to talk Natalie out of testifying against the murderer, they find something in the dig, Natalie and Jack have a deep conversation, somebody tries to talk Natalie into testifying, Eleanor once again encourages Natalie NOT to testify, Natalie receives a letter from Russell, Natalie and Jack have a deep and completely irrelevant to the story discussion... and so on.

D. Suffering the loss of her mother, rejection of her father, and the breakup of her married boyfriend, Dr. Natalie Nelson heads to Africa to join an archaeological team digging in a Kenyan gorge. This digging season proves to be the most intense the experienced team has ever had. Two team members raid the ancient bural grounds of the local Massai tribe in order to have modern bones for comparison to the bones they have discovered. One of them is murdered. From there, problems arise in many forms: criminal, moral, and political; with romance and natural dangers thrown in for good measure. I truly enjoyed The Clouds Beneath the Sun. The story never felt rushed or contrived. At over 450 pages, the author took his time to develop the story and the characters, as well as the believable setting. Although most of the book takes place either in the camp or in Nairobi, some of the best and most memorable parts of the book take place in the bush, at a secret lake, saving wildebeests, and over Christmas break in Lamu.

It's a pity because, as in the summary, we have an exciting premises here. The amount of repetition, especially whenever the heroine was being nostalgic, just gets old after a while. The reader doesn't need to be reminded every chapter or so just what issues she has. And each rumination doesn't need to be written like it's the first time she's thinking about it, when she's thought of it at least three times before. We get it! We also have your usual Mary Sue, where every male in the camp notices how attractive she is the moment she steps in. Oh boy.The setting is also set up a bit awkwardly. I had to remind myself a few times that this was set in the 1960's.

Stilted characters including evil (in Christopher) that is hard to believe and left flat except for obnoxious behaviors; vengeance and unreasonableness in Russel that was painful to read (it was too sharp and extreme--no sympathy/connection was built for the character, which was a waste b/c the potential was there), a very lifeless and loveless love with Jack.

In the first few pages the main character, Natalie Nelson, is on her way from Cambridge University to the camp, and she comes across a herd of elephants actually carrying out a mourning ritual...her first glimpse of the mesmerizing sights and sounds of Africa. The descriptions of the wildlife in Africa and the land itself was vividly and beautifully described by Mackenzie Ford.When Natalie does arrive at the camp site, she is happy to see everyone has his/her own tent with private bath facilities. This is especially comforting the following evening since she didn't get a warm welcome at dinner as a result of her being the novice paleontologist and making a comment that was viewed as criticism of one of the veteran archeologists.Just as things got better with that situation, and as the excavating continued, two veteran paleontologists, Richard and Russell, do something unthinkable, and a murder occurs. The sole witness happens to be Natalie. Natalie tries to relax and forget about the trial each night with a drink and a cigarette while listening to the African animals that circle the camp. The trial gets pretty complicated and worrisome for Natalie....a plea made to the Maasai chief concerning the trial is denied....the legal and cultural issues are of the utmost concern.The book was a little slow, but does become a lot better in terms of \"action\" as you turn the pages to the final chapters....the focus of the archaeological dig, the murder trial, Natalie's turmoil dealing with it, the power of money, societal issues within Africa, relationship issues among a group of people working and living together, personal secrets, and family issues that included sibling rivalry, betrayal, and deceit keep your interest.It wasn't a riveting novel, but it was intense at times, and it did bring you culturally into another very interesting society. The characters were well developed, and you could feel their pain, fear, triumphs, comradery, and all emotions that may have been felt from living in the middle of a beautiful, exotic African landscape. Being a passionate, knowledgeable paleontologist would have been even more helpful for enjoying the book.My rating is a 4/5 because the \"dig\" was very interesting and the cultural aspect made you think how we are all the same, but also different.

The story plays out amid the powerful clash of modern and ancient cultures and the feral beauty of the Serengeti.A newly minted Cambridge PhD, Natalie Nelson arrives on her first dig in Kenya\u2019s Kihara Gorge with enough skeletons in her family closet to choke a mule train. She becomes entangled with the Deacons, whose matriarch, Eleanor, heads the digging expedition, and Eleanor\u2019s sons Christopher and Jack, whose epic sibling rivalry spills over into tragedy. When two over zealous members of the expedition uncover a knee joint, Natalie recommends a comparison to modern bones to determine age before they publish their findings.

Also a wildebeest stampede, heat, dust, and more threats. Ford\u2019s characters, dialogue and plot are so vivid and three-dimensional, you can almost taste the roast chicken dinners, knock back Natalie\u2019s whiskey nightcaps, and smell the after-dinner campfire smoke.Ford masterfully rolls out a rising line of tension, romance, and social upheaval while avoiding sanctimonious sermonizing.

What I found especially grating is how the author keeps telling us about the protagonist's emotions - and everyone else's - but she doesn't SHOW them to the reader, which is why the characters can't hold up the story which, while being centered around a politically-important murder and the subsequent trial, also holds strong romance elements and an identity search for the main character. Plus I find the characters too one-dimensional, acting according to stereotypes: Russell-the-Australian constantly being observed as being (too) direct, Christopher only having the layer of jealousy, Eleanor-the-stern-mother/queen etc. Let's also not talk about the very stilted, unnatural dialogue.While for the sake of the story's development I was quite ready to willingly suspend my disbelief for the most part, towards the ending the melodram becomes so strong, especially adding a possible layer of homosexuality which feels more like average fanfiction than believable romance-adventure-thriller writing, that I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Don't get me wrong; I was and am fond of the story. With a critical editor I think much of it could have been salvaged; I see real potential here. But sadly it wasn't exploited and got published seemingly in the same state as when the author first put it down on paper.I do think the author made the right decision regarding the actual ending, though. The open structure of it gives back some of the satisfaction it took from me before, introducing some semblance of realism. I like that and feel thankful for it.All in all? I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, but I personally would have liked to work on it!"}, {"userName": "Felice", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2507841-felice", "userReview": "What I enjoyed the most about Mackenzie Ford's novel Gifts of War was the moral question that was at the heart of the novel. In his new to us but published in the U.K. prior to Gifts novel, The Clouds Beneath The Sun there is also a morality issue at the center of the story. This isn't a simple choice of do the right thing or profit by the evil path. Ford has made everything more complex and dangerous. There is a clear right and a wrong but the potential aftermath of either choice and how the characters got to where a choice was needed is all carefully mapped out in beguiling grays. The Clouds Beneath The Sun is set at an archaeological dig in early 1960's Kenya. It's the end of colonial rule, the continuation of tension filled race relations, tribal war, the discovery of \"The Cradle of Mankind\" all mixed together in this novel with characters who have hidden agendas and secret pasts. It's a very interesting stew and into it comes young Natalie Nelson from Cambridge on her first dig. Through Natalie we see not only the plot unfold but she is also our guide to the beauty and desperation of the country and the wholly absorbing elements of the dig. This is no marriage of Out of Africa and The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Clouds actually reads more like a classic American western. The lone female pursued by the men of the town determined to make her own way despite threats from the Native Americans, powerful landowners and a hostile environment. Will she do the right thing and save the souls of the town or the water rights from the greedy cattle baron or will she choose to do the easy road, avoid the High Noon moment and preserve the status quo? You'll have to read The Clouds Beneath The Sun in order to find out but not to worry you'll enjoy doing that."}, {"userName": "Ann ", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3240356-ann", "userReview": "I was very pleased to receive this uncorrected proof copy as a First-Reads give away.There were many historical aspects of this novel I enjoyed and found to be intriguing --Kenya in the early 60's, the role of the British Empire, archeological digs in Africa, the society of the Masai and their relationships with the characters. The author's vivid descriptions of the Serengeti and Nairobi made me feel as if he had experienced these locations himself. But the story seemed to drag and lose focus in places. While a murder occurs, it is more an element of the story for the characters to react to rather then a mystery to solve. Natalie, a British archeologist, murder trial witness and romantic focus of many of the male characters never seemed to ring true in her thoughts and responses to the situations presented in the story. (Or at least the descriptions of her responses seemed sometimes to be repetitive and unfocused.) Half way through I wondered if perhaps this was because she was a female character created by a man. I think there are many male authors who can do a great job of presenting realistic female characters--but not in this case. At the end I discovered that this story was based on fact. I wish that the author had expanded on this information and presented more on the history of the real events. It did make me wonder if it was difficult for the author to put fictional thoughts in the minds of real people."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3830946-sue", "userReview": "Natalie Nelson, freshly armed with a PhD and a host of emotional baggage over the death of her mother, the estrangement from her father, and a failed romantic relationship, arrives in Kenya in 1961 to join an archaeological dig. She hasn't been there very long before some amazing discoveries are made, which leads to controversy after two co-workers raid a Maasai burial ground for bones to compare with those found in the gorge. One of those co-workers is subsequently found murdered, with someone confessing to the crime. Natalie believes she was a witness to something and her testimony is taken. The remainder of the story is the wrestling with testifying vs. the pressure to protect the work in the gorge. She is also dealing with the emotional baggage she brought with her and her growing feelings towards Jack, one of the sons of the woman who is leading the dig. I'm giving this three stars instead of four, mostly because I feel the story could have been told in something less than 450 pages. Several sections were described in painstaking detail where I think a paragraph or two would have sufficed. And the drama at the end was a bit much. But it was interesting to read about Kenya in the months leading up to independence and the interplay between Maasai customs and British rule."}, {"userName": "Janice", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1428024-janice", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading this book; it has everything, mystery, political unrest,romance, adventure, a strong sense of place, moral dilemma, interesting characters. The setting is in Kenya, in the early 1960's, where an archaeological excavation over several years time has uncovered human remains that will change the theories of human evolution, and the entire field of paleontology. I suspected while reading, and my later research confirmed, that this is a fictionalized accounting of the findings at the Olduvai Gorge (called Kihara Gorge in the book), and based on the Leaky family (called the Deacon family in the book). However, I also learned that much of the portrayal in the book is inaccurate, as to the timing of political events, the animal habitat and behavior in that area, and the geography--but it is fiction! The moral dilemma faced by Natalie Nelson, the central character is an important one; Natalie must decide if the western ideals with which she was raised--Judeo-Christian values--are absolutes, or if there are times when the beliefs, culture and customs of a local tribal people should be honored. All in all, an interesting read, and worth the time I invested in finishing it."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/684141-kate", "userReview": "disclaimer: I received this book free from the publisher through goodreads first reads contest.This book was a very enjoyable read. Fascinating imagery of Africa and lots of information about the discoveries made there about early man. The story had a lot of potential, but I am left wanting at the mysteries left to us. I felt the story dragged on longer than was necessary, and as a reader I was subjected to long stretches of nothing happening and the story not advancing, interspersed with very interesting pieces of plot. The author gets very repetitive and I almost felt beat over the head with this repetition....yes, I get that the main character isn't an alcoholic just because she likes a nip of whiskey.....yada, yada, yada. I also felt that the characters conversations turned into history lessons when the character had no reason to be saying those things. It was a poor attempt at letting the reader understand the time period (1962 in Kenya). Such a great premise, just poorly executed.I didn't realize that the characters were based on factual characters until the end. That made this book even more enjoyable for me. If not more sad."}], "description": "An exotic setting and a passionate, forbidden affair make The Clouds Beneath the Sun an irresistible page-turner that is sure to satisfy readers looking for an intelligent blend of history, romance, and intrigue. Mackenzie Ford (a nom de plume) was introduced to readers in 2009 with the publication of Gifts of War, which was praised in USA Today as \u201can absorbing, morally complex read.\u201d In a starred review, Library Journal said, \u201cFord keeps the reader on a knife\u2019s edge as the lies build and the truth is only a word or misstep away. Highly recommended.\u201d Now Ford takes us to Kenya in 1961. As a small plane carrying Natalie Nelson lands at a remote airstrip in the Serengeti, Natalie knows she\u2019s run just about as far as she can from home. Trained as an archeologist, she accepted an invitation to be included in a famous excavating team, her first opportunity to escape England and the painful memories of her past. But before she can get her bearings, the dig is surrounded by controversy involving the local Masai people\u2014and murder. Compounding the tension, Eleanor Deacon, friend of the Masai, who is leading the excavating mission, watches a rift grow between her two handsome sons. Natalie\u2019s growing attrac\u00adtion to Jack Deacon soon becomes a passionate affair that turns dangerous when she must give evidence in a trial that could spark even more violence and turmoil. The startling beauty of the Kenyan setting, the tension of loom\u00ading social upheaval, and the dizzying highs and crushing lows of a doomed love affair are all captured brilliantly on every page of this extraordinary and utterly unforgettable novel.", "title": "The Clouds Beneath the Sun", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7963218-the-clouds-beneath-the-sun", "average": 3.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320418740l/7963218.jpg", "reviews": 100, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2735339.Mackenzie_Ford", "name": "Mackenzie Ford"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical", "Romance", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7963218-the-clouds-beneath-the-sun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7058371-the-clouds-beneath-the-sun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19811012-the-clouds-beneath-the-sun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5982152-gifts-of-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20981895-flowers-in-winter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31455882-loves-and-lamentations-of-a-life-watcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31667012-loves-lamentations-of-a-life-watcher"]}
