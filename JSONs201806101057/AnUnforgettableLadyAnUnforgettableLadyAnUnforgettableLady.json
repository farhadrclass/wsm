Ward, about tough, cold, cynical, hardened, and emotionally detached ex Special Forces soldier turned private security specialist John Smith, who\u2019s hired as a bodyguard by billionaire New York socialite Grace Woodward Hall, the Countess von Sharone, to protect her from a serial killer targeting her and five other high-profile society women. Although John feels initial disdain for Grace\u2019s glamorous, perfected appearance and glitzy lifestyle and she resents his gruff, remote attitude and rigid, high-handed ways, they prove the old adage that opposites attract. Despite their differences and occasional hostility, John and Grace experience an immediate, intense attraction and volatile lust that becomes increasingly difficult for them to deny or ignore, especially as they get to know each other better and when deeper feelings enter the mix. He is determined to maintain a professional relationship and has vowed never to become emotionally involved with a woman, even when Grace starts to chip away and thaw his icy exterior and threatens to blow his carefully laid plans for a solitary, unattached life all to hell. Can Grace convince John, a hard-edged man scarred both inside and out, to take a chance on love and a future together?This is only the second book I\u2019ve read by Jessica Bird, and although I liked Beauty And The Black Sheep, this was much closer to what I\u2019d expected from a contemporary romance written by the WARDen. Although the love scenes are still fairly mild, especially compared to the steamy Black Dagger Brotherhood series, John Smith is definitely a tortured alpha hero reminiscent of the Brothers, and something about the heated, intense emotional encounters and explosive sexual tension between John and Grace reminded me a little bit at times of Zsadist and Bella, which I loved of course.I really enjoyed An Unforgettable Lady, and I\u2019ll definitely read the sequel, An Irresistible Bachelor, and the rest of her Moorehouse Legacy Silhouette series, which also features related characters.

I\u2019ve enjoyed all of Jessica Bird aka JR Ward\u2019s earlier writing and thankfully this was no exception. No matter the stage in her career Bird/Ward can write the desirable and initially unobtainable dark and tortured heroes like no other. As a result I fell hard for John Smith the cold, scarred, I am an island, and everybody back the hell off bodyguard. Yup he\u2019s all kinds of ways yummy. And if any of you BDB fans need a little more encouragement he reminds me very much of an early Zsadist prototype, here\u2019s why from page 147;His first instinct was to yell. He was infuriated that she had challenged him, exposed him. That she was near enough so he could smell her. That she was offering compassion and understanding and warmth when he was battle scarred, hard and ugly. I think you're beautiful\" she said softly, looking up at him. \"Then your f***ing blind\" She shook her head slowly \"I see you, all of you. Clearly.\"I should also mention that the sexual tension in this story is off the chart hot. While I had trouble relating (on any level) to our glamorous billionaire heroine, Countess Grace blah biddy blah and all her fancy galas, gowns, gems and uppity social status the palpable sexual tension and opposites attract theme between our couple more than made up for it. And I just have to say again John Smith--well his character is reason alone to read this book. Forced into the spotlight by her considerable wealth, soon to be divorced heiress Grace Hall has just found herself the target of a serial killer. Following the publication of a Times article showcasing the 6 most prominent women in New York, one by one those women, her friends have started turning up dead. Reluctantly Grace is forced to hire a bodyguard, now however she finds herself subject to the ironclad rules of her captivating protector. Oh and did I mention he\u2019s moved into her Penthouse? In spite of their differences and his cold demeanour Grace is drawn to him in ways she can\u2019t explain or stop herself from acting on.John Smith is a ghost. As a military trained assassin, professional bodyguard and all-round badass John hasn\u2019t heard his real name spoken in so long now that he\u2019s almost forgotten who he used to be. With no fixed address, social insurance number or ties to anyone he moves from one job to the next, content in his solitary life. Meeting Grace changes everything though and with the attraction between them growing stronger and harder to ignore with each passing day, John may be forced to break his own rule. Never get personal with the client. For John she was just meant to be another assignment how is it that she\u2019s managed to get so thoroughly embedded in his skin? And how is he going to leave the only women he\u2019s ever loved when the jobs over?Oh I forgot to mention, anyone that\u2019s read Bird\u2019s Moorehouse Legacy series will be thrilled with a brief cameo from another awesome tortured hero; Alex Moorehouse the sailing champion from.From The First.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I didn\u2019t LOVE it as I did the other Jessica Bird books that I\u2019ve read. Important Message : This book has been re-released and included a nice note from the author explaining the evolution of her stories and writing style. The only part I\u2019ll mention here, because I feel that it\u2019s most important and speaks volumes to her growth as a writer is that she\u2019s stopped allowing her Rice Krispies to decide the direction her stories will take. She still allows them some input, but she\u2019s much more disciplined a writer now, and she \u2013 not her breakfast cereal \u2013 has the final say. Whew! And praise the Scribe Virgin for that because comparing this book with what I find to be her more professional, polished work found in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series written under the name, J. R. Ward, I have to say that I\u2019m not sure the BDB would have the same intensity if Snahp, Crahckle and Pohp were calling the shots. Can you imagine what the Brothers names might be like? Fibher, Whohle Grahain, Mihlk, Nutrishous, Delishous... Yeah, see\u2026 those just don\u2019t have the same feel, nor would they strike the same level of terror into the Lessers as names like Tohrment, Zsadist, Phury, Wrath, Tehrror, Vishous, Muhrder or even Bloodletter do.But I digress\u2026.The first half moved a bit slowly for my taste and there was an exorbitant amount of internal dialog which sounded a lot like this: John Smith: I want her, but I can\u2019t have her. She deserves better. My job is dangerous, she\u2019d never be safe. She\u2019s just a job. When this is over, I\u2019m walking away. I have to say, that got really, really old, really, really fast. And from Grace Hall we got a whole lot of: So what if I\u2019m a trjillionaire socialite and he a bodyguard\u2014that shouldn\u2019t matter to him one bit. Why does he care if I\u2019m a Countess, it\u2019s by marriage only\u2026 and speaking of marriage, why should it matter that I\u2019m a married woman \u2013 we\u2019re getting a divorce!  So yeah, spending \u00bd a book inside their heads like that just didn\u2019t \u201cdo it\u201d for me.Then we get to the 2nd half and things finally start taking off. People are being gruesomely killed by a neat freak who rips their throats out and then tidies up their clothing, a chef who is 2 eggs shy of a 3 egg omelet trying to singlehandedly take over the catering needs of most of New York City, and a disgruntled employee who is trying to overthrow the Hall Foundation\u2019s hierarchy. Those things made for some interesting reading. One thing that bugged me was Grace\u2019s incessant griping about not needing a body guard when clearly she did \u2013 she was on the list of women featured in the newspaper article which was also the killer\u2019s checklist for who was next on his hit list. Well, she wanted a body guard, but didn\u2019t want to have to alter her lifestyle at all. Not exactly the brightest bulb in the box, if you ask me. I didn\u2019t feel anything special for her or about her, and didn\u2019t feel that she was deserving of John as her happily ever after.Now John Smith\u2026 *sigh* Wow. What a man! He was angsty, sexy, demanding, scarred, sexy, intelligent, intense, sexy\u2026 whether writing as J.R. Ward or Jessica Bird, this author knows how to put together one incredible hunk of male. Did I mention he\u2019s one sexy guy who can guard my body any day?And speaking of sexy, the sexual  intensity was quite high, but there wasn\u2019t much of the act itself. They wanted each other, they knew they did, but kept talking each other out of it. I was like, WTH? I mean, when Grace finally gave John the green light and he was getting into it, she throws on the brakes. Then later, he\u2019s all hot and bothered, she\u2019s like \u201coh, yeah,\u201d then HE puts a stop to it. It worked for awhile, but then seriously, it went from being exciting sexual tension to frustration and overkill. Overall, after looking past the slow start to the story and Grace\u2019s TSTL (Too Stupid To Live) moments, it was an enjoyable read. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ll add it to my \u201ckeepers\u201d shelf, but I am glad I read it, and I\u2019m looking forward to An Irresistible Bachelor."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3919132-linda", "userReview": "John Smith: a common-enough name for a dangerous man. He owned the small elite firm, Black Watch, Ltd. His employees were former Rangers, Marines and Navy Seals. He trusted them implicitly. With his military and intelligence background, he was a personal security specialist. It was a fancy name for bodyguard. But not just any ordinary protector, he was an investigator, a champion and, if needed, a killer. He was at the top of his field and thrived on not taking a break; he always had a new job just around the corner. Grace Woodward Hall, Countess von Sharone, had discovered after her brief marriage that her husband was not up to par. He was unafraid of using her inheritance to fund his lifestyle. He was also verbally abusive; they had separated and she had applied for a divorce but she was keeping everything under wraps. She was afraid of what the publicity would do to the family name. The stress of this was bad enough but then she found herself included in a list of prominent women that were being murdered. Somehow she was connected but neither Grace nor the police understood why. John Smith was her answer. John was everything that Grace was not. He accepted the job with the understanding that she would follow his directions at all times. But neither one was prepared for the chemistry that thrummed whenever they were near each other. This story was written in typical Jessica Bird aka J. R. Ward fashion with an uber-alpha male, a strong heroine and intense emotional turmoil. The bulk of this romance concerned their friction and tension. Each of them spent a lot of time arguing in spite of their own internal dialogue. Have any lovers loved as these lovers loved? Only Jessica Bird knows for sure."}, {"userName": "AgentScully", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2716603-agentscully", "userReview": "I admit I picked up this book because the author is well-known and successful in another genre, and I was curious but do not read paranormal. Judging by this 1 book, I cannot see what the fuss is about. The writing style is simple, the romance is so-so, the suspense plot is feeble with only 2 viable suspects, and the heroine pulls a couple of TSTL moves. The plot centers around a serial killer offing prominent society women. Jhon, er John, is the bodyguard hired to protect the heroine who's on the list. Unfortunately the author doesn't build or sustain suspense very well. I never felt any creeping menace or sense of inexorable approaching doom. Huge chunks of pages went by with nary a mention of the killings. And with only 2 suspects (I guessed correctly if anyone's interested), there's not much mystery either. Grace was an okay heroine. She just seemed overwhelmed for a large portion of the book, trod on by everyone from her mother to her employees. She starts to get it together towards the end but then ruins things with the aforementioned TSTL stunts. Why must heroines who know there's a killer after them elude their bodyguards to go jogging alone? Why do heroines have Mace handy to use on said bodyguards but never on the actual villain? To add to the cliches in the plot, the police arrest the wrong man and the heroine is unprotected when the real killer strikes. Of course the hero arrives at the last second. John didn't really grab me because I never felt that I got to know him well. There was some good banter between him and Grace in the beginning, but it got tiresome as they refused to give in to their attraction or were conveniently interrupted while groping. The unresolved sexual tension led to frustration bordering on cruelty, with the hero getting mean and flinging the wh_re word at Grace. Ughh. At least when they finally gave in, after a couple of hundred pages of frustration, I expected fireworks to go off. Instead we get only 2 pages of to-the-point lovemaking. And subsequent sex is all behind closed doors. Now I don't demand graphic sex scenes in every book (really!), but when an author builds up the lust so much there needs to be some payoff. The whole subplot with Callie felt tacked on and didn't interest me at all. I could see that it helped strengthen Grace by removing the weight of her father's shadow, but it occurred too late in the book to be totally successful with that. It also distracted from the serial killer plot just when it should have been rising to its climax and dissipated whatever tension the author had managed to build. It got increasingly obvious too that Callie was being set up as the heroine in a sequel and the space devoted to that proved annoying. Plus I didn't think it showed the heroine in a great light either, that she seemed most concerned whether Callie was a golddigger who would try to claim a part of her father's estate. Nor did she offer to share any of her inheritance with this close relative who was clearly down on her luck. In short, this book had a lot of problems. If the romance was more convincing, I might still have given it 4 stars. But it felt too much like lust rather than love to me. I didn't like that John abandoned his job of guarding Grace near the end (even if he did arrange a substitute). Would a man in love do that when the woman he loved was in danger? Also there weren't enough or hardly any scenes of the hero and heroine being actually happy together. A longer epilogue with some loving scenes would have gone far toward painting a convincing HEA here. At least my curiosity about this author has been satisfied. I won't be picking up any of her other books any time soon and this one goes on the swap shelf."}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "I don\u2019t normally read contemporary romance novels. In fact, it seems rare that I read books without any paranormal beings. I had heard about this book from the Romance Readers Reading Challenges group and I have to admit that I was curious. I didn\u2019t know that J.R. Ward had used another pen name -- Jessica Bird. I must say that I like this incarnation of J.R. Ward. This is definitely a nice break from all those vampires, werewolves, and other assorted paranormal creatures I had been reading about. The edition I read was a reissue published in 2010. I would recommend reading the author\u2019s note at the beginning of the book. It does give you some added insights into the characters and the writer\u2019s frame of mind while writing this book. An Unforgettable Lady is the story of Grace Woodward Hall or the Countess von Sharone and her bodyguard John Smith. Grace is a wonderful character. She is from a wealthy society family; she is beautiful, smart, and a genuinely caring person. Grace is married, but she is separated from her good for nothing playboy husband. One word can describe John Smith: hawt! He is handsome, protective, dangerous, and sexy. John has a special ops background. John enters Grace\u2019s life during a gala event where he is responsible for the security of an ambassador. There is an instant chemistry between John and Grace and they share a very hot kiss. When Grace\u2019s life is threatened later on in the book, John comes highly recommended as a body guard. Grace decides to hire John and the delicious sexual tension begins.There is a long, long build up in this relationship. The sexual tension is exquisite. At times, I felt like I needed a cold shower. I really liked John\u2019s character. John is conflicted. His military background made him aloof at times. Due to the nature of his chosen career, he has never had a long term relationship with a woman. He offers Grace a sexual relationship where he would satisfy her needs, but with no strings attached. When his job was finished, he would leave. John lets Grace ponder this situation to decide what she would like to do. Interestingly enough, this is where we see a little of the \u201cWardisms\u201d come out \u2013 the possessiveness, the \u201cmine\u201d, the need to possess. John can not commit to Grace, yet he can not stand the thought of any man being interested in her. I found that I had guessed who the culprit was about 2/3 of the way through. And no, it wasn\u2019t the butler!My only criticism of this book was the lack of any kind of showdown between Grace and her estranged husband, Ranulf. I find it odd that an estranged husband would not do anything once his wife\u2019s life was threatened. Odder still, that they didn\u2019t have a shouting match or any kind of confrontation at the end of the marriage. It seemed to all be handled rather impersonally by the lawyers. The novel had an entirely different feel from J.R. Ward\u2019s Black Dagger Brotherhood books, yet in a way, some of her \u201cWardisms\u201d did manage to slip in. I didn\u2019t mind; I liked that series. I think I like this book more. I really enjoyed reading this book and I am looking forward to getting my hands on An Irresistible Bachelor for more of this side of J.R.

R. Ward. It's kind of a hybrid of a standard contemporary romance and a romantic suspense. I say this because the suspense element is present but somewhat in the background as a group of high society ladies who were all featured in the same newspaper article are picked off by a serial killer one-by-one. The heroine is one of the women from the article, so she rather reluctantly hires the hero to act as her personal bodyguard. However, there are no direct attempts made against her until the end of the story, and I have to admit that it was pretty easy to figure out who the bad guy was. In between the murders, there is a nice romance with the hero and heroine experiencing a strong, immediate attraction that eventually leads to a steamy affair. Grace was a very strong woman who never backed down from John's caveman act when they first met and she subsequently hired him to protect her. She was controlled most of her life, first by her parents and later her husband, and she's not about to let John waltz in and take over too. She's struggling to find her footing as an independently wealthy woman who has just taken the helm of her father's charitable foundation upon his recent death, while the sexist, old-school boy's club is trying to push her out. I like that she runs the family foundation differently than her father and avoids spending money on frivolous things like any good charitable organization should, even though the men in power disagree with her methods. Outwardly, Grace is very controlled, but inwardly, she's sometimes falling apart as she suffers from anxiety and self-doubt. She has a very complicated and strained relationship with her mother that obviously contributes to her self-esteem issues, which I would have liked to have seen explored in a little more depth. Grace also later discovers that there were things about her father she thought were true, but weren't. It would have been nice to see her feelings on that subject brought out a little more too. Initially, John seems to have a bit of a chip on his shoulder where the rich and powerful are concerned. I think this is because, although his job is to protect them, he sees into their personal lives in a way that few others do and generally doesn't like the reality of what most of these types are like. It takes him a little while to figure out that Grace is different. To her, John seems a little too much like her controlling parents and husband, so he has to find the delicate balance between lightening up a little in their personal dealings and still being hard-nosed from the bodyguard angle in order to effectively protect her. John can definitely come off as being quite arrogant at times, but Grace often surprises him and occasionally makes him smile. He possesses an iron grip of self-control and cares enough about Grace to not want to hurt her even though he's caught up in an intense desire for her. Despite his passion though, John is still pretty closed off throughout most of the story. I really would have loved to see him open up a little more. He also has a pretty tortured past that was only briefly touched upon, and I would have liked to have seen explored in more detail.Grace and John have both been deeply hurt in their pasts, and I think each of them recognizes that hurt in one another as well as the need to be in control. I really enjoyed the opposite sides of the track characterization and how Grace is a poised, society lady while John is a rough around the edges former special ops guy who doesn't put much stock in wealth and prestige. They didn't exactly start off on the right foot, but in spite of their early bickering, the sexual tension was high from the beginning. It was never a question of will they or won't they, but when. And when they finally do give into their attraction, the love scenes were very sensual, though nowhere near as hot as the author writes in her more recent books. The one thing I have noticed in these early books of Ms. Bird's is that her heroes have a tendency to hold out on expressing their feelings until the final pages of the novel which doesn't always lend itself well to building and maintaining an emotional connection, but despite this, it was still a very good story.Although the author's website doesn't officially connect any of her contemporary books as a series, I've seen An Unforgettable Lady grouped with Heart of Gold and An Irresistible Bachelor as The Walking Papers Trilogy, although I have no idea where that series title came from. Other sites simply have An Unforgettable Lady and An Irresistible Bachelor paired as a duet. In any case, all three books contain common characters. Grace is best friends with Carter, the heroine of Heart of Gold, and was first introduced in that book. Carter and her hero, Nick, appear in the early part of An Unforgettable Lady when Grace goes to visit them, and Nick is instrumental in Grace hiring John as her bodyguard. An Unforgettable Lady also introduces Grace's good friend, Jack, and another young woman, Callie, who become the hero and heroine of An Irresistible Bachelor. At the very least, I would recommend reading these latter two books in order, otherwise, readers will get one fairly significant spoiler. Overall, I enjoyed reading An Unforgettable Lady. I loved Ms. Bird's little shout out within the narrative to Gaelen Foley, another of my favorite authors. Other than my few minor complaints, this book was very well-written and in my opinion, reflects an earlier version of the style that Jessica Bird has developed in her highly successful J. R. Ward persona. Anyone who has enjoyed her Black Dagger Brotherhood and Fallen Angels books will probably like this one too."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3050338-leah", "userReview": "Grace Woodward Hall is a member of the social elite, has inherited money and the Hall Foundation from her father, and married into royalty.

Upon her return, he screams at her and their relationship becomes tense. They later move past this, but Smith thinks that he can't take care of Grace in the right way and calls in his right hand man, Tiny, to take his place. A few days later, the night of Grace's large Gala at the Hall Foundation, Tiny shows up and Smith finds out that the NYPD had a suspect in custody as the fourth woman attacked awoke from her coma and made a statement. The night is a huge success. This is, of course, after Grace Maces Tiny and sends him to the hospital while she has one of her security men stick to her. When everyone is gone, Grace goes to her office to get her belongings. Meanwhile, Smith gets a revealing call and rushes to her aid. The killer had Grace cornered in her office! Smith bursts in and tackles Frederique, the caterer spurned by all the women he attacked. When he's arrested and Grace and Smith finally have time alone, he reveals that he loves her and wants to spend his life with her. They kiss and make up, and live happily ever after.Grace was a very likable character. I loved her from the beginning, from the moment she shot sarcastic quips at John Smith. I admired her strength and vulnerability. I also admired her honesty, especially the way she was willing to acknowledge her feelings.John Smith was your typical tortured hero, with his own special qualities thrown in the mix. He was an amazing character who often reminded me of Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood. He was a strong, capable male, but he was also very closed, sharing very little of his life with Grace or anyone else.I have to admit that I had a bit of a hostile attitude towards Jack Walker through most of the book. It irked me how flirty he was with Grace, even though I knew they were just friends. I'll be interested to see how his romance with Callie builds and grows in An Irresistible Bachelor.I knew, knew Frederique was the killer from the moment he came into the book and started throwing all Grace's friends' names around. There was something very suspicious about him the whole time he was there talking to her.I thought there was an oddly conspicuous lack of Grace's soon-to-be-ex husband. I felt like he should have shown up at least once in the novel. I kept waiting for a confrontation between him and Smith.The one thing that irritated the hell out of me was Grace and Smith's almost-but-not-quite-there sex! How many times do you guys have to express the fact that you want to have sex but not actually go through with it. When they finally did have sex, I was more relieved that it was finally over than happy that they finally found a way to be together.Overall, this was a great book and I'm glad I read it. It was nowhere near as good as BDB. But, then again, what is? Anyway, a great read and it deserves all the stars."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3125133-amy", "userReview": "You know when you want to love something so bad, but no matter how hard your try, you just can't? You like it, but it doesn't blow you away? Yes, the synopsis of the book brought back early 90's memories and had me involuntarily singing Whitney Houston's \"And I Will Always Love You,\" reminiscing about her days on screen with Kevin Costner in \"The Bodyguard.\" While the movie, to my recollection lacked suspense, I unfortunately felt a lot of the same with An Unforgettable Lady.John Smith is all hard, arrogant, brash alpha male. He has no family, and his few friends are his brother's in the Black Watch Security Firm which he heads up. A former Army Ranger and covert ops man, John has witnessed a lot and survived a lot both growing up and in past assignments. John's mind and body work \"in the now.\" He is a task driven man that focuses on completing the job, no strings attached, no emotions involved so that he can pick up when the job is done and move on to the next. Grace Woodward Hall is a New York City socialite who married into royalty. While she holds a title Countess von Sharone, Grace is a very down to earth woman with a lot of pressure on her after the recent death of her father. She has taken over his foundation and is trying to prove to the long term employees that she is capable of handling the job. She is also in the middle of getting out of a loveless marriage by divorcing her husband. Two people from different worlds, John and Grace meet at a party where he is stationed as security for the Ambassador. Once their paths collide there is immediate heat and sparks between the two which led me to believe this was going to be a steamy, suspenseful read. What brings the two opposites together again is a serial killer who is targeting and killing prominent socialites. Grace hires John as a personal bodyguard to protect her until the killer is caught.What was frustrating to me was the murder plot never really took off. The author didn\u2019t really present many suspects and there was no buildup to each victim. The suspense was very flat and I was never on the edge of my seat wondering when and where the killer would strike next. The relationship between John and Grace was strained throughout the story and in the end had me questioning if they really had anything more than lust. Ms. Bird can write strong sexual tension, but after a couple of hundred pages of buildup, once the lovemaking commenced, it lacked luster and was a less than stellar payoff for all of the frustrating tension between the two.Now I had to keep in mind this was early work of Jessica Bird, who is now a New York Times Best Selling Author otherwise known as J.R. Ward. Ward is THE author that reignited my love for fiction several years ago with the Black Dagger Brotherhood and I have not looked back since. More than anything I was anxious to see if her early work conveyed any nuances or glimpses of the future brotherhood in the making.In Ms. Bird's letter to her readers, at the beginning of the book, she states that \"it was an incredibly inefficient process\" of how she went through the layout and process of writing An Unforgettable Lady, early on in her career. She further stated that it took her four contemporary romances to finally find \"her craft.\"\"In this book, it turns out I was starting to head into vampire land - I just didn't know it.\"'To be truthful, I did not feel Ward\u2019s style in this story. However, I will say that John had several subtle characteristics of Wrath (Dark Lover) but not to the extent that I saw the brotherhood in it's development. In retrospect, I have to say that this book is far from bad, but it's just not to the level I have come to know and expect J.R. Ward to deliver. It goes to show us how a writer can come full circle once finding \"her craft\". And any Ward fan that has read the Black Dagger Brotherhood knows she has found it!"}, {"userName": "Elphaba J", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355865-elphaba-j", "userReview": "A apar\u00eancia de perfei\u00e7\u00e3o come\u00e7a a perder o seu encanto com a chegada do medo, da morte.A seguran\u00e7a, uma nova prioridade, transforma-se no novo comandante da sua vida e, aquele que oferece um pouco de estabilidade, tende a tornar-se, a pouco e pouco, o senhor do seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o.Diz-me Quem \u00c9s \u00e9 uma narrativa repleta de momentos tensos com paix\u00e3o e suspense em que, as suas personagens cuidadas, se v\u00eam envolvidas nas hesita\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00f3prias do amor e de um mist\u00e9rio que ultrapassa os precedentes habituais, com um serial-killer arrepiante e que banhar\u00e1 a nata social de sangue.O pseud\u00f3nimo Jessica Bird apresenta uma escrita direccionada para os leitores de policiais sem esquecer os aficionados do romance que, com fluidez, conseguir\u00e3o entusiasmar-se atrav\u00e9s de lux\u00faria e perigos capazes de causar palpita\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e0 mais fria das pulsa\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00faltima p\u00e1gina.Opini\u00e3o completa: http://historiasdeelphaba.blogspot.pt..."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4365117-emily", "userReview": "When Grace Hall socialite friends are being stalked and murdered in their homes, she knows she maybe next on the list.

Grace Hall, Condessa von Sharone \u00e9 uma destas mulheres que pertence ao c\u00edrculo das individualidades mais influentes desta cidade. E a sua riqueza f\u00e1-la ser um alvo para o louco que utiliza Manhattan como seu territ\u00f3rio de ca\u00e7a. Por causa destes eventos, Grace Hall decidi contratar o melhor especialista de seguran\u00e7a alguma vez visto. O seu nome \u00e9 John Smith e ele \u00e9 um homem que s\u00f3 v\u00ea trabalho \u00e0 frente. Nada na sua vida tem prioridade e para John o trabalho \u00e9 a sua vida, at\u00e9 ter conhecido Grace. Ap\u00f3s Grace contratar John para se assegurar que nada de mal lhe acontece, os dois decidem que John ir\u00e1 viver temporariamente no apartamento de Grace. O acordo \u00e9 uma mera praticabilidade mas depressa ambos compreendem que a atrac\u00e7\u00e3o poder\u00e1 interpor-se no caminho deles.Al\u00e9m de correr perigo de vida, Grace vai no entretanto revelar alguns segredos no que concerne \u00e0 sua fam\u00edlia e o mundo parece que p\u00e1ra. A confus\u00e3o na vida de Grace est\u00e1 instalada e parece que a sua atrac\u00e7\u00e3o por John n\u00e3o \u00e9 o maior dos seus problemas. Creio que n\u00e3o seja segredo nenhum que n\u00e3o sou f\u00e3 da autora J.R.Ward. De facto, as nossas rela\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e3o h\u00e1 j\u00e1 algum tempo cortadas. Tenho perfeita no\u00e7\u00e3o que n\u00e3o irei ler mais nenhum livro do pseud\u00f3nimo, mas quando ouvi falar sobre o lan\u00e7amento da s\u00e9rie de Jessica Bird (o nome verdadeiro da senhora) decidi dar-lhe o benef\u00edcio da d\u00favida e ver se o meu problema era com o pseud\u00f3nimo ou com a escritora em si. Muito me esforcei para n\u00e3o criar um determinado conjunto de expectativas e estou orgulhosa de mim porque posso dizer que fui para esta leitura com uma mente aberta, conforme me foi poss\u00edvel. Abstra\u00ed-me ao m\u00e1ximo de me focar no nome da autora e consegui com isto ver o livro de uma perspectiva imparcial, ao m\u00e1ximo.Embora este t\u00edtulo me fa\u00e7a confus\u00e3o e me fa\u00e7a levar as m\u00e3os \u00e0 cabe\u00e7a, n\u00e3o deixam de ser pequenos pormenores e no final de tudo, o que me interessa \u00e9 que o conte\u00fado me satisfa\u00e7a. O meu g\u00e9nero liter\u00e1rio favorito s\u00e3o os policiais, seja em que formato, estilo ou de que maneira s\u00e3o escritos. Este \u00e9 considerado como um policial rom\u00e2ntico, que \u00e9 um formato que gosto muito, desde que ambas as partes se encontrem equilibradas. Neste caso, posso garantir que este livro \u00e9 mais romance do que propriamente policial. N\u00e3o \u00e9 que seja um factor dominante, mas gostaria que as duas vertentes estivessem mais equilibradas.A escrita da autora j\u00e1 n\u00e3o me \u00e9 estranha e posso dizer que este registo \u00e9 bem mais agrad\u00e1vel do que a do seu pseud\u00f3nimo. Flui muito mais facilmente e consegue atrair de forma mais eficiente a aten\u00e7\u00e3o dos leitores. No entanto, \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel negar que os maneirismos est\u00e3o l\u00e1, especialmente aquele que me irrita mais, que \u00e9 o contacto inicial dos protagonistas e o romance no geral. Para mim \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel conceber que duas pessoas que se vejam pela primeira vez, tenham uma combust\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea nos primeiros 2 minutos. Uma coisa \u00e9 paix\u00e3o/amor \u00e0 primeira vista, ou o que lhe quiserem chamar, outra coisa totalmente diferente \u00e9 a parvo\u00edce e o rid\u00edculo \u00e0 primeira vista. O romance entre os dois protagonistas n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada de especial, falta-lhe especialmente intensidade emocional, que \u00e9 uma das coisas a que dou mais import\u00e2ncia e a Bird n\u00e3o consegue mostrar-me isso. Ela gosta \u00e9 de intensidade sexual e pouco aprofundamento, porque isso \u00e9 que mostra como um casal gosta um do outro e como s\u00e3o importantes um para o outro.N\u00e3o gostei especialmente destes dois personagens, pois n\u00e3o senti grande liga\u00e7\u00e3o com os mesmos, mas acho que a autora fez um bom trabalho com a explora\u00e7\u00e3o dos protagonistas e especialmente com a do assassino.Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 parte policial e misteriosa do livro, posso dizer que fiquei desiludida que fosse t\u00e3o apressada. Apesar de ter sido bem explorada, acho que os eventos podiam ter-se desenrolado de forma mais natural e n\u00e3o t\u00e3o r\u00e1pida. Contudo, tenho que dar a m\u00e3o \u00e0 palmat\u00f3ria e referir que o mist\u00e9rio \u00e9 denso de tal forma que s\u00f3 me apercebi da solu\u00e7\u00e3o quando esta se revelou em frente dos meus olhos. Por isso, Bird merece um grande ponto positivo. Bem gordinho. Tanto o mist\u00e9rio principal, como o enredo secund\u00e1rio foram bem constru\u00eddos e explorados e cheguei ao fim com a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o que n\u00e3o me teria importado se a autora se tivesse estendido um pouco mais. Concluindo e resumindo, acho que a autora esteve bastante bem, considerando todas as nossas lutas passadas. De facto, parece que n\u00e3o \u00e9 com o seu pseud\u00f3nimo que n\u00e3o vou fazer as pazes, mas sim com a \"original\". Ap\u00f3s este livro, que embora n\u00e3o me tenha surpreendido conseguiu captar a minha aten\u00e7\u00e3o, quero continuar a seguir a s\u00e9rie intitulada Mulheres Inesquec\u00edveis.Para quem gosta de policiais rom\u00e2nticos, ao estilo de Sandra Brown, Nora Roberts, Tess Gerritsen (embora esta \u00faltima compara\u00e7\u00e3o seja feita de forma muito generosa) e afins, creio que gostar\u00e1 de experimentar esta vertente da Bird, conhecida anteriormente pela saga da Irmandade.Com romance, mist\u00e9rio e bastante ac\u00e7\u00e3o, promete entreter o p\u00fablico que gosta de um livro com um desenvolvimento r\u00e1pido e din\u00e2mico."}, {"userName": "MsRomanticReads", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596362-msromanticreads", "userReview": "During a special event, Grace (Countess von Sharone) catches the eye of an intense and brooding stranger. Fascinated, she goes after him and corners him. She pushes his buttons until the stranger startles her with a fiery kiss full of passion, then he leaves. The next day she finds out that one of her close friends has been brutally murdered and the only thing the killer left behind was a newspaper article with a lineup of high society women. Grace is among those women mentioned. On edge and worried for her safety, her friends decide to call in a bodyguard, one of the best. When John Smith enters her life, she's stunned to find that he is the stranger who kissed her at the ball. At first she refuses to hire him until another body turns up and her fear that she's being followed moves her into action and accepting his help.John Smith, former Army Ranger turned bodyguard, finds himself cornered by the Countess von Sharone during a ball. He's instantly attracted and simultaneously infuriated that this mystery woman has managed to get under his skin in a matter of minutes. When he leaves her after sharing a passionate kiss, he doesn't know who she is, or that their paths will soon cross again. When a friend asks him for a favor to meet with a woman who is in fear for her life, he agrees to meet her. His attempts to dissuade her from hiring him are futile, and one week later he's moved into her apartment, sleeping in the guestroom and has to share her bathroom. Naturally, living in such closed confines is bound to send the sparks flying.I loved both characters from the start. Grace is not at all the snobbish, high society woman one might expect. She has a heart of gold, which comes across anytime she interacts with other people, especially the people who used to work for her late father. She's 30 years old, on the brink of a divorce from Count Ranulf von Sharone who is a real jerk, she's busy warding off the throwbacks on the board of directors of her father's foundation, trying to prepare for a gala that can make or break her, in a constant fight with the second in command of the foundation who wants nothing more than to take her place, she has to fire an obnoxious and irritating chef who will not take no for an answer, her mother is a controlling and seemingly cold woman, she's probably being stalked and a target for a serial killer, and on top of all that, she has to put up with John and his hot and cold mood swings. Frankly, for most of the story, Grace is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I thought she held up very well under all the pressure and scrutiny, and thankfully she realized early on that it would be wise of her to grow a backbone and take back control of her life. I thought she had great tenacity and always said what she felt. She managed all this while still keeping her dignity. John, was a conflicted character. I know some people probably wouldn't have liked his behavior towards Grace, but I found it very believable. He's lived through a lot - first during is bad childhood, later in the Army, and finally as a bodyguard. He's used to being alone, and he knows the pitfalls of what having any loved ones in his life could mean. They could be used against him at any time and carm to harm in his line of work. Being with her would ultimately put a spotlight on him as well, and that is something he can't afford to have. Regardless, no matter how hard they try to deny what is happening between them, they can't stop it, but they sure it very difficult for themselves. And that is where the roller coaster of emotions comes in. I teared up and fist pumped my way through this book.After having read J.R. Ward's paranormal series, this was a big change. If you've read BDB first, don't forget that this was written in 2004. It's different, but it's really good because it's the WARDen. I have read the second book, An Irresistible Bachelor , and it was even better. An exciting read on all levels.I guess GR hasn't updated the pictures since the books got a makeover. The Unforgettable Lady series and The Moorehouse Legacy series crossover. To keep up with the flow, the order to read these is:An Unforgettable Lady - Grace & JohnAn Irresistible Bachelor - Jack & CallieThe Rebel - Nate & FrankieFrom The First - Alex & CassandraHis Comfort And Joy - Gray & Joy"}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2390440-tara", "userReview": "This is my first Jessica Bird book, but I'm a J.R. Ward fan so I thought I'd give it a shot. This is not the author I've come to like. If you are looking for more J.R. Ward, this isn't the place. I could easily have been reading Julie Kenner or Meg Cabot. This is a chick-lit romance, with a murder mystery subplot. I suspected who the murderer was around page 100 and was definite by page 150, but maybe that was just me. There were very few suspects introduced and there was very little done to create a sense of foreboding. No near misses or creeping shadows which made this part of the story fall flat.John Smith is head of a security company, he's a ghost basically hiding from his past and the many things he's done both legal and non. Grace Woodward Hall is a socialite-soon-to-be-divorcee, who is also a Countess. (But she married into the royal title) They meet within the first 10 pages and the meeting is a little hot. When they meet again you expect that things will heat up, but really it's about a 270 page simmer before they get to it, and even then, it's really tame compared amount of time she spent building the sexual tension.I never really connected with the characters. Maybe it's because I can't connect when a privileged person wants to let everyone know how hard they have it because they are privileged and things are expected from them. Maybe it's because as likable as the guy was, he lacked a personality. As a whole the book came off with a \"polo shirt on the east coast shore\" type of feel with lots of refined and even more repressed conversation. Not to mention that Grace our heroine really pulled some cliched tstl crap.There seems to be some set up for the \"companion book\", An Irresistible Bachelor, which really just seems to be the sequel. Part of the set up was in the form of a handsome privileged man clearly introduced to cause a riff between the H/H in this book, which I guess it sort of did, but not really. As a matter of fact the order in which the scenes played out really even cheated the reader out of suspecting possible tension. The female introduction came very late in this book and successfully diffused any possible tension about the murder mystery plot. Not to mention, the author tipped us off to her introduction at least 50 pages earlier and I spent all that time wondering why no one else noticed.I don't know if she's just become a better writer or if this isn't really her genre. Overall it was better than expected so that's something. I'll read the \"companion book\" because I already have it.

No matter if she writing as herself or under Jessica Bird, her books are killer, 100 percent gold. I have yet to read a book by her that I did not like, which is saying something pretty big, since she has so many novels under her belt. An Unforgettable Lady is a book that romance lovers cannot miss. Especially is your a suspense and mystery lover also. Wealthy, gorgeous sophisticated woman meets a hard, wounded and unchangeable male.At first you think, \"okay, this isn't too original..\" but it really is. The only thing not original about it is the males name, John Smith. It's pretty funny actually. John is a hard headed man, with a face and body anyone could love, but he isn't interested. That is of course until the beautiful Grace Hall walks into the room and he can't keep his eyes off her. He may think she's off limits to him, but that doesn't mean he can't look. And does he look! At times, I found myself wanting to yell at John, he could be mean and rude and so... Hard headed. I guess that's just men for you. But although he was mean, I could see where he was coming from when he would lash out or say things he regretted. He was confused and hurt, and not used to feeling anything for anyone. And Grace made his mind and heart do a 180. Grace a a great character. She's strong and smart, but not a kick butt type of heroine, which I liked for a change. She's not weak, but she is vulnerable. Everything is her life is making her just about to snap, between her dying father, her unhelpful, soon to be ex husband and now a death threat made out her her and all her friends, her life really seems to be going down hill. She is grateful for Johns help, and feels more protected from bodily harm, but she may be in some other kind of trouble when it comes to Mr. Smith. What a book! I love, love, loved it.

It could have been a 4 or even 5 star book but she took it just there and then backed off with everything, the hero was slightly alpha, the sex scenes were just a bit hot but never all the way sizzling, and the one liners and were far and few between.

John Smith is a retired special forces/Army ranger/assassin killer turned bodyguard. She hires him and they fall in love. Think this is original and groundbreaking? You'd be wrong on both counts. However, don't let that stop you. Just because somebody painted a woman before doesn't mean an artist couldn't paint the same woman and make something special. I don't know as though I'd elevate this to such a lofty status, but it was certainly entertaining. Grace is just the right blend of innocence and steel that makes her an alluring heroine. John Smith is the typical alpha male (and I can certainly see how Ward said he was her inspiration for Wrath in the BDB books). However, even Smith makes mistakes and shows growth and emotion. Good crisp writing kept me turning the pages. I liked it."}, {"userName": "Annie (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489554-annie-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Posted on Under the CoversAs a fanatic \u2013 almost rabid- fan of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series, I cannot help but gush over J.R. Ward writing. So, in the effort to cover my bases a little more, I decided to pick AN UNFORGETTABLE LADY off my bookshelf and read it. I was pleasantly surprised because I thought that this was a strictly contemporary romance, but I soon found out that it\u2019s a romantic suspense.Bird captured my attention with the first sizzling hot kiss between the hero and heroine of this book. Grace Hall is a countess. She\u2019s wealthy, privileged and scared out of her wits because members of society are now being killed off one by one. In addition to that, she had the added stress of maintaining her father\u2019s fortune after his recent death while also dealing with the repercussions of her ongoing divorce.When she first meets John Smith, their meeting is a heated one but in not the way you think. They bicker with one another, neither one allowing the other to gain the upper hand. Smith is a man of little words. He is a man who is content with who he is and isn\u2019t looking for change. His life may be lonely, but at least he has control over it and so when Grace learns of another murder, she hires Smith as a personal bodyguard to ease her nerves a bit. It\u2019s Grace\u2019s effort to gain control of her own life.As their lives collide, Grace soon finds herself unable to deny the attraction that she has for Smith. Similarly, Smith can\u2019t help but notice that Grace isn\u2019t an ice princess that society portrays her to be. He learns that she has a fire in her.Bird does an excellent job of transitioning from feelings of extreme fear to lust, reaching the opposite end of the emotional spectrum that a character can feel. What I loved about this book is that the in-depth thought processes of a character that readers enjoy from the BDB books are still evident in Bird\u2019s writing. She writes in a way that you feel as if you are Smith, as he battles between his sense of honor and duty and his lust for Grace.In the note to readers at the beginning of this book, Bird mentions that she sees Grace and Smith similar to Marissa and Butch because Grace is wealth and class while Smith could not be any more different than her. I do see the resemblance, but I feel like their personalities are more similar to Z and Bella. Much like Z, Smith warns Grace off, telling her that he is a man one night stands, not of lazy morning-afters. But like Bella, Grace doesn\u2019t allow him to push her away. She is determined, and in the end, she gets what she wants.AN UNFORGETTABLE LADY turned out to be an enjoyable read that I would recommend to readers who enjoy romantic suspense. It has the same elements of our favorite books by Ward, but just a different backdrop and a little more emphasis on suspense. But in the end, the product is the same. It\u2019s gold."}, {"userName": "BookFiend", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196082-bookfiend", "userReview": "Grace Hall is an influential figure in Manhattan's society. She comes from a wealthy Manhattan family, is a countess by marriage, and now is the head of the Hall Foundation, an organization founded by her father. Grace was one of six women featured in an article that ended up as a serial killer's hit list. Grace turns to John Smith, a securities expert with a murky past, to protect her.The book is short, a little over 300 pages. Perhaps partly due to its length, I felt the characters were not fully fleshed out and developed. Grace seems like a pale predecessor to Marissa from Lover Revealed. I liked Grace, mostly. Her biggest problem is standing up to other people, including her late father, her soon-to-be ex-husband, her mother, all of whom tend to run roughshod over her. But she's trying. She's trying to run her father's foundation. She's trying to stand up to her mother. She's trying to stand up to John. While Grace does some stupid things, in general, she was pretty likeable, maybe just a tiny bit boring.I actually didn't like John very much. John seems like a pale predecessor to any of the BDB alpha heroes. My biggest issue with John was I felt he was not very nice to Grace. John has a somewhat mysterious background. It has been mentioned that he does not have a social security number and obviously the name John Smith is an alias. I know what you're thinking - Nooooo! Really?! John Smith is an alias?? Indeed it is! There are implications that his background may have been concealed due to his previous work for the government but nothing is very clear. Basically, John feels like he can't get close to anyone due to the enemies he has made in his previous line of work. So he pushes Grace away despite his attraction to her. But he seems to go to the extremes. At one point (pretty late in the story), he thought Grace made out with him and then turned around and slept with someone else so he basically called her a slut. It seemed pretty unbelievable that at such a late stage in their relationship, he can contemplate that she would do such a thing. He apologizes later, but it seems pretty lame to me. That level of mistrust is not something that can be overcome by a simple apology.I guess I didn't really buy into the love story between John and Grace. The ending seemed a bit unrealistic too. Essentially, all of a sudden, once John realized he loves Grace, all the obstacles seemed to magically disappear, including his lack of a real identity, his supposed enemies etc. The suspense portion of the story was not too bad. Ward also introduces some secondary characters who are in other books. I might go pick those up at the library or something so I can see what happened to them.Overall: I gave it 2 stars. It was okay. But definitely check out the BDB series by J.R. Ward. It doesn't compare.Full review here: http://bookfiendo.wordpress.com/2011/..."}, {"userName": "Ana Luisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4709566-ana-luisa", "userReview": "Este foi, para mim, um dos livros mais esperados do m\u00eas. Tinha uma enorme curiosidade em saber como Ward se sairia com romances policiais e mais uma vez n\u00e3o fui decepcionada. Habituada aos seus famosos livros da \u201cIrmandade da Adaga Negra\u201d, n\u00e3o pude deixar de comparar John Smith com a personagem ZSadist dessa mesma saga. \u00c9 dif\u00edcil de chamar esta autora pelo seu nome, ela \u00e9 e sempre ser\u00e1 para n\u00f3s J.R. Ward, mas a verdade \u00e9 que Jessica Bird \u00e9 o seu verdadeiro nome. Este livro foi publicado pela primeira vez em 2004, um ano antes da publica\u00e7\u00e3o do primeiro volume da saga da Irmandade e posso dizer seguramente que Ward tem um dom especial para a escrita. Ao contr\u00e1rio de outros autores, ela consegue ser multifacetada e escrever sobre diversos g\u00e9neros liter\u00e1rios, o que \u00e9 surpreendente.Este livro conta-nos a hist\u00f3ria de Grace, uma mulher que aparentemente tem uma vida privilegiada e perfeita, mas que de repente se v\u00ea envolvida numa serie de assass\u00ednios, na qual poder\u00e1 tornar-se na pr\u00f3xima v\u00edtima. Com o aux\u00edlio de amigos contrata uma empresa de seguran\u00e7a para ter consigo um guarda-costas, s\u00f3 n\u00e3o espera encontrar um desconhecido, que na verdade era algu\u00e9m com quem j\u00e1 se tinha cruzado antes e por quem tinha sentido uma atrac\u00e7\u00e3o avassaladora. John Smith \u00e9 o nosso querido bad boy, com todas aquelas caracter\u00edsticas que n\u00f3s adoramos e logo no in\u00edcio ficamos \u201ccaidinhas\u201d pela personagem. Os ingredientes s\u00e3o irresist\u00edveis: passado misterioso, arrogante, auto-suficiente, charmoso\u2026melhor mesmo \u00e9 parar com as descri\u00e7\u00f5es e deixar-vos descobrir o resto. Adorei o livro, apesar de se focar mais no romance entre os dois protagonista e deixar a parte policial para segundo plano, mas talvez isso nos deixe margem para conhecer melhor as personagens. O \u00fanico defeito tem a ver com as interrup\u00e7\u00f5es nas cenas picantes, deixei de contar as vezes que John e Grace foram interrompidos a meio de um acto sexual e em situa\u00e7\u00f5es que deixam qualquer leitor frustrado, mas tudo isso funciona apenas para um culminar ainda mais emocionante.Quanto ao assassino, no in\u00edcio n\u00e3o pensava que fosse aquela personagem, mas aos poucos comecei a desconfiar dele, apesar de haver mais hip\u00f3teses e at\u00e9 ao final ficar sempre em aberto a possibilidade de ser ou n\u00e3o aquele o culpado.Mais uma vez, menciono que adorei esta nova faceta da autora e espero sinceramente poder voltar a ler outras obras de Jessica Bird."}, {"userName": "Isabel  Almeida (Os Livros Nossos)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7277147-isabel-almeida-os-livros-nossos", "userReview": "Traduzido para Portugu\u00eas sob o t\u00edtulo \"Diz-me quem \u00e9s\"Este romance de J R Ward , sob o pseud\u00f3nimo Jessica Bird, traz-nos a escritora de fantasia num g\u00e9nero que n\u00e3o era ainda conhecido do p\u00fablico Portugu\u00eas.Um romance sensual soft, que nos d\u00e1 a conhecer Grace Hall - uma milion\u00e1ria que busca protec\u00e7\u00e3o ao ver as suas melhores amigas serem assassinadas por um misterioso assassino.Grace acaba por contratar os servi\u00e7os de seguran\u00e7a de John Smith, um perito na seguran\u00e7a de celebridades e membros da alta sociedade ou da Pol\u00edtica, o qual passar\u00e1 a residir no apartamento de Grace, devido ao risco que esta corre ao viver sozinha (encontrando-se em processo de div\u00f3rcio, o que tamb\u00e9m ser\u00e1 causa de preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es adicionais para Grace).Desde o in\u00edcio que h\u00e1 entre ambas as personagens uma forte tens\u00e3o sexual (um pouco a fazer-nos lembrar algumas s\u00e9ries televisivas dos anos 80), mas ambos lutam contra tais impulsos.Uma leitura agrad\u00e1vel, para descontrair, nao sendo brilhante, \u00e9 um bom livro para levar em f\u00e9rias, por exemplo."}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1758041-jenn", "userReview": "At first, I liked this story pretty well. The love angle was totally unbelievable, though. It kept getting worse and worse. I have absolutely no patience or love for those instant intense connection stories. I just don't like them. Especially when one of the players is a supreme asshole to the other. This is one of those stories. Regarding the \"mystery\" portion, it was EXTREMELY obvious from the beginning that it was going to be one of two people. As the 'hints' were dropped, it was EXTREMELY obvious which of those people it was going to be. Also *SPOILER ALERT* what the hell was the deal with the sister? She was added to the story very late and nothing was done with her. What was that stuff between she and Jack? It was creepy and odd and never explained. I liked J. R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood books well enough (Except for the overuse of the word \"shitkicker\") but they got to be extremely repetitive after a while.

No sizzling sex scenes for this unforgettable lady unfortunately.And another disappointment was that I had guessed the killer and ending by chapter 3.

The books started pretty slow. The suspense was not suspenseful. I figured out from his first appearance who the bad guy was. There wasn't much protection going on but then there wasn't much to that part of the plot. Mostly it was a convoluted will they won't they fall into bed story. If it's a bodyguard story I want to see the need for the bodyguard and see him doing his stuff. Seemed like the author would occasionally remember that he was supposed to be working and would throw in a line about him scanning the street but I just didn't feel it. Didn't really buy the romance element either.
