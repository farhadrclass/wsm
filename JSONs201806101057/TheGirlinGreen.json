When they first meet the Gulf War has ended, at least ended as far as the United States is concerned, now turning to a peace keeping role, but as far as the infighting between the different tribes are concerned, there is no peace. Arrowood Hobbs, a young private in his early twenties, is guarding the northernmost end of the American Zone, checkpoint Zulu, it is here he meets Benson, a journalist embedded with the army. Before the day is over a young boy will be saved and a young Iraqi girl in a green dress dead. This death will have serious effects on both of these men and their future lives. They will reunite twenty years later because of another girl in green. A ill advised quest for redemption. Written with a great deal of ironic humor, pop references abound, a book that highlights the absurdity of war. So much to understand in the Middle East, and this book shows how little is understood, despite many agencies and their efforts. It is at times an edge of your seat thriller, a political nightmare, an a PR challenge. What we see on television is only what they want us to see, not too surprising. I loved these characters, all of them, well except for the bad guys of course, they are unique, well intentioned and just trying to save as many as they can. We also see how the first event, led these two memo to the lives they led.A wonderful, well written story that has once again reiterated how little we know about the various cultures, tribes, affiliations in the Middle East. Meddling in things in which we never should have gotten involved. At times reading this book, this was confusing, but I loved the main story and on that is what I focused. The author is well qualified, and has a unique understanding of this region as one can see if they read his bio. Fascinating, informative and another great offering from this author.ARC from publisher."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "[On their way back to the base they find Hobbes, but soon they are surrounded by Iraqi soldiers and as they plead that the girl is allowed to come with them, a soldier shoots her.

Those sentences were scattered throughout, yet I had difficulty seeing them as a cohesive story. It felt uneven to me. After loving his first book so much, I never expected to struggle with this one. The subject matter undoubtedly was my main problem, with Desert Storm being over but not really over, and the various Iraqi factions that I've never been able to keep straight. Difficult a read as it was, however, I still persevered because of my faith in the writer to pull it off.

Miller. It\u2019s late March 1991, and United States Army Private Arwood Hobbes is at the northern edge of Checkpoint Zulu, \u201cmaintaining a vigilant perimeter\u201d in Iraq\u2019s newly-brokered peace, when a British journalist from the Times wanders up. Thomas Benton is a seasoned war correspondent who\u2019s after the story from a local perspective. With some encouragement from Arwood, he walks toward nearby Samawah, intent on interviews and ice cream. A surprise attack sees Hobbes and Benton trying to rescue a villager, \u201cthe girl in green\u201d, but the situation somehow ends badly, leading to their removal from the area and an eventual \u201cother-than-honourable\u201d discharge for Hobbes. Fast forward twenty-two years, when a lingering feeling of guilt and a YouTube clip see Hobbes and Benton once again trying to rescue \u201cthe girl in green\u201d. Is it human design or divine intervention that sees the original players of the drama and its aftermath gathered together again? Their mission is surely insane and bound to fail!As with Norwegian By Night, Miller gives the reader an original plot with plenty of action, a twist or two, and a thrilling climax. Generous doses of tension are relieved by the banter between the characters, which is often blackly funny. Miller\u2019s characters are wholly believable and, for all their quirks and very human flaws, especially appealing. Miller\u2019s considerable personal experience in both conflict zones and policy making is apparent on every page and he raises several thought provoking topics, including the intricate coordination and extensive diplomatic skills required in hostage negotiations, the crazy Catch 22 in the Department of Veteran Affairs that exists for veterans needing psychological counselling, the failure of foreign organisations to become familiar with the language, politics and customs of the countries they are purporting to aid, and the fate of national staff of NGOs when their employers withdraw due to escalating hostilities. Miller gives the reader a novel that is topical and highly relevant in today\u2019s world. Fans of Norwegian By Night will not be disappointed with Miller\u2019s latest literary foray and will be hoping for more from this talented author soon. The Girl in Green is exciting, insightful and entertaining: another brilliant read."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "When British Journalist Thomas Benton meets US soldier Arwood Hobbes in 1991 at Checkpoint Zulu near the Kuwaiti border where he is part of the force remaining to keep the peace after the end of Desert Storm, he sets in train events that culminate 22 years later in a dangerous and daring rescue mission. Benton wanders off to a nearby village hoping for some local stories and gets caught up in a mortar attack on the village by local insurgents at the start of what will become the Iraqi civil war. He flees back to the checkpoint dragging with him a young girl in a green dress who he has rescued. Unfortunately just as he is within sight of the checkpoint, the insurgents catch up with them and execute the young girl. Neither Benton nor Hobbes ever get over the brutality of this wasteful and malicious killing so when they see a young girl in a green dress caught up in a similar attack on video some 22 years later they feel compelled to mount a rescue operation. What follows is an almost absurd series of events as Benton and Hobbes convince various NGOs into lending them the resources they need to launch a rescue mission in a war zone. That Derek Miller has a background in international affairs and policy and has worked in war zones, shows in his account of how things really work. Many situations ring so true, including the scene describing a food drop of deadly frozen chickens, that they must have actually happened. Instead of telling us the futility of the developed world interfering in Middle Eastern politics, he shows us why it is absurd and futile using dark humour, likeable characters and fine writing skills to make his point and engage us with good story telling at the same time. Many reviewers have likened this to Catch-22 and there are certainly strong parallels. Certainly he shows us how naive we are in thinking we can ever sort out the complex politics involved bringing peace to the many cultures and tribes of this region of the world."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "Welcome to post-war Iraq, where it\u2019s increasingly difficult to distinguish the war from the so-called peace. Derek B. Miller has worked on international peace and security of diplomatic missions and the United Nations, and it shows. His book has the ring of authenticity, which makes for mesmerizing reading.The novel starts in 1991,when two men \u2013 a British war journalist named Thomas Benton and a fearless and possibly unhinged American private named Arwood Hobbes, meet at Checkpoint Zulu, close to the Kuwait border. There, after becoming involved in a local situation, they witness the senseless execution of a girl in a green dress.Fast forward. It\u2019s now 22 years later, and the men are haunted by what they\u2019ve seen. Hobbes sees another girl in a green dress on Al Jazeera, and convinces Benton \u2013 whom he hasn\u2019t seen in all these years \u2013 to join him in a quixotic quest to save her. Benton reflects: \u201cI\u2019 starting to think\u2026that maybe we leave parts of ourselves behind in certain situations \u2013 some essential piece of ourselves that we have to cut off, otherwise there\u2019s no way out.\u201d He jumps in with both feet.The ensuing cinematic plot might fall into the adventure story genre, except that Miller knows his stuff. In Catch-22 prose, this author reveals how things really are during these \u201cpeace\u201d years: our total misreading of the culture of those we decided to \u201cliberate\u201d, the way that various NGOs come together behind the scenes, how the media gets the story wrong, how hostage situations truly play out, and how girls with green dresses will continue to populate the landscape.In an age of cynicism, the theme of The Girl in Green is this: the only thing worse than evil is deciding that evil didn\u2019t matter. At their Core, Benton and Hobbes still believe that individual lives matter. That message \u2013 despite the darkness in this book \u2013 is heartwarming."}, {"userName": "switterbug (Betsey)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey", "userReview": "\"It has been said that the US army was designed by geniuses to be run by idiots.\"It isn\u2019t every writer that accomplishes what this author did: grip me from the first to last pages. Miller\u2019s cinematic and CATCH-22-esque story is suspenseful, and the prose is lucid and muscular. The thrilling plot threads, the robust characters, and the enduring themes develop with a fluent and resonant rhythm, keeping me fastened to the book at every turn. I wanted to call in sick rather than ever put it down! I kept turning the pages, eyes glued, caught up in the excitement of the novel.Although this takes place in Iraq in 1991, during the early days of the Iraq civil war, and 22 years later, when Muslim anti-sentiment has been entrenched worldwide (and middle east regions and their people are lumped together in many people\u2019s minds), this isn\u2019t a war or political novel. It is about individuals caught up in the torrent of ignorance, collective hatred and prejudice, fueled by war and conflict, and inflamed by misinformation and aggression. On top of that, it is a prismatic scrutiny and ironic double-back on media. And the fact of bureaucracy makes a sinister contribution. However, the reader witnesses the small but significant acts of kindness and humanity, which are both organic and startling, but not sentimental or syrupy.Derek Miller tells a powerful story that enlightens without pandering or condescending to readers. He doesn\u2019t press any political agenda but does underscore the potency of rhetoric on groups and individuals. Moreover, deception and withholding of information is also demonstrated as insidious and dangerous. Hobbes Arwood, a young American soldier in his early 20s, and Thomas Benton, a 40-something war correspondent working a rank and file job for the Times, meet for the first time near the peace-keeping demarcation line at Checkpoint Zulu, near the Kuwait border, in 1991. As Hobbes na\u00efvely asks, \u201cWhen is this war gonna end?\u201d his wake-up call begins when Benton responds, \u201cIt did. The war is over. This is the peace.\u201d In the meantime, Hobbes\u2019 terrific one-liners and sideways dialogue, infused with pop culture, add a droll flavor to the text. \u201cI have this theory that everything you truly need to know\u2026deep down and for the duration, can be learned from Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off \u2026To me, the army is Principal Ed Rooney, and you need to be Ferris.\u201d For their brief but critical time together, Benton is now Ferris to Arwood. But serious events cloud their rapport. They witness a young girl\u2014the eponymous girl in green-- executed by a tyrannical Baathist colonel. The subsequent but insanely risky rescue by Hobbes of a young boy is not enough to offset the hollowed-out despair left by the young girl\u2019s death. There are also incongruous scenes of levity mixed with dread that point to the absurdity of giving aid for self-aggrandizement, the lack of humanity in a humanitarian effort. Miller\u2019s talent demonstrates that, rather than these scenes possessing an air of writer impropriety, they emphasize the vulgarity and solecism that belong to the perpetrators. The author expresses folly and unseemliness with empathy and black humor. A spectacle, depicting frozen chickens being dropped for food aid, left me almost speechless with horror and dark mirth.The chance for Hobbes\u2019s and Benton\u2019s redemption come 22 years later when a YouTube video in Iraq goes viral across the globe, showing what looks like the very same girl in green in a queue with Kurd refugees. A mortar is dropped on the crowd, causing an explosion and widespread death. The date: 2013. How can the girl that died reappear? Is it her, a doppelg\u00e4nger, a trick? \u201cI don\u2019t know. A coincidence. An echo. A midday moon in a blue sky.\u201d What follows is the meat of the story, when Benton and Hobbes connect again in Iraq, and attempt to find and save the girl. But, nothing is easy and all goes awry. The riveting events that unfold are on point and inclusive, connecting all the themes to the plot of the story, and kept me in a buzzed state of anticipation on every page. In addition, the weight of all the red tape and competing or allied institutions and NGOs were, I suspect, purposely confusing at times, in order to highlight the burden of \"cooperation.\"Miller never loses sight of the individual, and there were several that we rooted for. All the characters were finely drawn and nuanced, and family bonds, both dear and broken, those by blood and others by choice, were the heart of the novel. You\u2019ll find it pumping on every page."}, {"userName": "Mary Lins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14389832-mary-lins", "userReview": "READ THIS!

Miller's writing style and narrative \"voice\" are unique, crystal clear, and both witty AND weighty. I laughed many many times, even though the subject matter is horrific. The novel revolves around the wars in the Middle East and it's clear that Miller has not only researched his subject matter, he's recognized the cognitive dissonances and formed astute opinions (his take on educating the women being the solution is worth the price of admission). Through his novel he humanizes what most of us only skim in the news. He puts us Right There; that's why I think everyone should read this novel. To say the novel is \"timely\" is a gross understatement.Arwood, a private in the Army and Benton, an English journalist, meet at Checkpoint Zulu at the rim of the Euphrates Valley. It is 1991 and the first Gulf War has just ended; but the turmoil has intensified. (We readers know how this all plays out, unfortunately). Very Bad Things Happen that form a connection between Arwood and Benton even though they don't reconnect for 22 years.

The magic that a great writer can conjure; transporting the reader to the Middle East, revealing more and more about what happened and is happening in the world, describing evil, and creating real and compelling characters like Arwood and Benton with whom I instantly fell in love.Please Mr. Miller, turn this into a screenplay.

The Girl in Green will stay with me because some parts are seared into my mind. The frozen chickens for example. (And I loved the bit about the Princess Bride!)

But if you\u2019re looking for an in-depth and insightful literary experience related to the incredibly complex nature of Middle-eastern affairs then this would be a wise choice.Two main characters drive the plot: the American, Arwood Hobbes, whom we first meet as a US Army private manning Checkpoint Zulu at the very end of Desert Storm in 1991. There he meets a British reporter, Thomas Benton, who tends to take on war correspondent duties to avoid his frustrating home life. They get caught up in a horrific attack where they try to save the life of a girl in a green dress\u2026and fail.That\u2019s the set-up but most of the novel takes place 22 years later. These two men have lost contact with one another long ago but out of the blue, another girl in a green dress is caught in another attack but this time it is caught on video which subsequently goes viral. Arwood contacts Benton and they set out to try to achieve what they couldn\u2019t the first time: save the girl in the green dress.I chose this book because of the fine reputation its author has built following the publication of his first book, Norwegian by Night. But as a retired member of the US military who served during Desert Storm as well as during much of the on-going build-up to the mess that we currently have in the region, I found more than my share of connections. The author\u2019s own extensive background working with several agencies in the region including NGO\u2019s (Non-Governmental Organizations), the UN, etc, has given him great insight on how things work (and don\u2019t work). All of his characters ring true, and Arwood Hobbes in particular, is a comedic masterpiece in the same vein as Captain John Yossarian in Catch-22.This is not a military book, nor is it an \u201caction\u201d novel despite there being quite a lot of action occurring, including a well-imagined hostage situation in the final third of the book. In fact, I struggle to classify it in any particular way which, I suppose, is a good thing. There is a lot of social commentary from the author via the characters and he doesn\u2019t pull any punches on the overall effectiveness of those trying to help out those innocent human beings that get caught up in the nightmare that is modern war. There were several times when that got a little heavy-handed and I felt like I was being lectured for living in a world that would let such a complex atrocity get to its current level. And that\u2019s the main reason this one doesn\u2019t get 5 stars from me. The writing is superb, the characters vibrant, and the story is most definitely a worthy one to be told."}, {"userName": "Roman Clodia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia", "userReview": "\"There are always reasons, Jamal, but not justifications\": thus Arwood Hobbes, the improbable moral centre of this intense and brilliant novel set amidst the chaos of Syria and Iraq. Miller knows what he's talking about and the story drips with authenticity from the aid workers to the various armies, the refugees to the journalists. It would have been easy for this to be sanctimonious and hand-wringing but the style is lit by a cynical, acidic humour that reminded me irresistably of Catch-22: the scene with the food pallets and frozen chickens, for example, is both absurd and tragic and could only be true.What makes this so special, though, is the character of Arwood, a kind of 'holy fool': we first meet him as a twenty year old GI bored on a guard outpost on the Iraqi border but he has the ability, despite the lack of a formal education, to see through to the heart of things: \"a person's a person, no matter how small, right?\". It's this fundamental understanding that guides Arwood's actions, not always comfortably, and carries others in his wake. I don't want to say more about the plot which would constitute spoilers but this is a book that I couldn't stop reading. In lots of ways this is a profoundly pessimistic as well as a prescient story yet there are moments of hope: 'And yet, his sadness for her is also real, and for a moment he allows himself to feel it, if only because its wellspring is humanity's only hope'. Miller has written something perfectly-paced and beautifully-judged that combines a page-turning plot with a clear-sighted vision of the best and worst of human nature."}, {"userName": "Alex Cantone", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48050946-alex-cantone", "userReview": "In 1991, at Checkpoint Zulu Southern Iraq after Operation Desert Storm, American soldier Arwood Hobbes meets \"Times\" reporter Thomas Benton, the one bored, the other itching to find out the real story.

As Hobbes observes \"...forget the bible; this place has been populated since the Sumerians; that's six thousand years....the place has to be haunted...it's a ghost factory.\"People's movements are written in the present tense, giving a sense of 'real time', and past tense reserved for historical reflections. There's the absurdity of well-meaning but misguided case officers, offering platitudes and motherhood statements in English, which have no parallel in the Arabic language. Arguable, the best characters are the minor ones: the Assyrian medic who risks his life to deliver a message to a Yezidi storekeeper to pass on to ISIL, his fate left as a footnote in history.

It reminds me in more than one way to Catch-22. Especially in the tone, and in the basic vulnerability of the protagonists. The two main characters are superbly framed and not cardboard or cartoon like. But I thought too that several aspects were just too contrived, convenient to pass reality muster. I know too many desert vets and men/women like my brother who have done more than double stints. Human life is not held to equal values; not even when it is \"ours\". Regardless of who \"ours\" becomes today. That's exactly why the premise and original situation (the 1991 girl in green) was, IMHO, so well done. This is gritty war copy. It is intrinsically sad, desperate, and often horrific. I got the feeling while reading it that I get when I read Southern USA grit. lit. Laugh? Cry? Stomach-turning! Which is not enjoyment by any definition.This region is a terrible cabal of human rights destroying belief systems, associations to \"loyalty\" which flex and curve, and has general mindset for tribal or 7th or 8th century sensibilities tied to 20th century general weaponry. Women and animals have it much worse whenever the \"uppers\" disagree. Normal times are just mutilation and basic slavery for both.The aspects with regard to PTSD? Not incorrect, but fiction full-blown in most long term \"reaction\", IMHO, not parsing well with the reality of such conditions I have seen/witnessed. It's erudite in tone, style, message without seeming to be so. That isn't a bad thing, but if it had been far more the way soldiers talk in reality, it would have been a 4 star.

A lot of people would do well to read this one (about 40 percent of America, for starters)."}, {"userName": "Paul Lockman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53495766-paul-lockman", "userReview": "After recently enjoying Norwegian by Night recently, I just had to read The Girl in Green. The main characters are Thomas Benton, a British journalist and Arwood Hobbes, a disaffected US army officer. Marta, a Swedish humanitarian aid worker also appears regularly. The first brief section of the book is set in the Gulf War in the early 1990s near the border of Iraq and Kuwait, then the majority of the book is set some 20 years later when circumstances bring the three of them together again in Iraq. Hobbes and Benton feel guilty about a girl in a green dress that was shot in front of them in the Gulf War and have come back to Iraq to \u2013 well to redeem themselves I suppose for not having been able to prevent her from her fate.I do think Derek B. Miller is a very talented, intelligent and creative writer and I really like the characters and the clever and witty dialogue, which is often laced with absurdity and irony. After reading Norwegian by Night I asked him via Goodreads whether he was influenced by Catch-22 and the laugh out loud absurdity of some of the situations and dialogue in that book. He replied \u2018I've wondered about Heller's influence on me and I still wonder about it. In one way \u2014 sure, absolutely. But there's more to it. I surely saw 300 episodes of MASH before I actually read Catch-22 (which of course was directly inspired by it). So there's also that. But I also think that Heller (and I, and many others) are drawing from some original Jewish source material anchored in an attuned eye for the absurd and a nearly pathological incapacity NOT to draw attention to it.\u2019There\u2019s a very interesting interview with him here: https://bookpage.com/interviews/20812...There is a bizarre incident where the US Air Force is going to drop rations, in this case frozen chickens, but doesn\u2019t do it correctly.\u2026\u2019As she had anticipated the air force started pushing pallets out of the transport planes from much too close and much too low. The parachutes opened, but the pallets of frozen chickens did not land well. The air force should have used sling-load helicopters, but they didn\u2019t because there was no doctrine to tell them to do so, and pushing pallets out of planes was faster, cheaper, and more dramatic.Some of the pallets were cushioned in their landing by the soft bodies of the Kurds, who were crushed under them and died.As the seals broke on others, the chickens broke free and chased the uncrushed, who scattered like free range bowling pins.Thomas Benton, Arwood Hobbes and Marta, take shelter from the flying frozen chickens in a US armoured personnel carrier. A US army officer and a French army officer are also inside it and they get talking\u2026.\u2019Clearly,\u2019 said the French officer, \u2018it is the air force. This is what I have come to expect from the air force. I expect it because dropping things on people is what the air force does. Drop aid to the refugees. Drop aid on the refugees. One little preposition to separate them, and no doctrine in place to draw the distinction. One little word and voila. Crepe a la Kurd.\u2019Arwood Hobbes makes attempt at cracking jokes but no one laughs and Herb, the US army officer, ends up asking him if he has PTSD. To which Arwood replies\u2026\u2019Well, there\u2019s a phrase. Post-traumatic stress disorder. I wouldn\u2019t call it post-traumatic, no,\u2019 he said, as three men about twenty metres away grabbed a chicken from a woman who was standing with two small children, and then pushed her to the ground as she tried to resist. \u2018I admit I\u2019ve been wondering for the last few days about why I can\u2019t sleep, and when I do, I dream of strangling dinosaurs with piano wire. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of something I did. I think it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t do. I think I have pre-traumatic stress disorder. I think I\u2019m stressed out from not being able to do the right thing. And then, to top it off, the army has decided that my inaction wasn't inactive enough, and by not doing even less I was doing too much. And so I\u2019m getting bad paper when I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not convinced my brain is working on the same frequency as the world around me. I mean, look out the window. How can I be the only one who finds this hilarious?\u2019 he asked. He did not laugh, though.In the acknowledgements, the author tells us that this episode with the frozen chickens really did happen.We get some great insights into the world of humanitarian aid workers like Marta and the way the Arabic speaking world can be alienated by the West\u2019s good intentions\u2026..\u2019Marta needs a cigarette now. She does not have one. And so she holds her Bic fountain pen as though it is the cigarette that she ought to have. She is sitting on an orange chair at a white table, listening to a briefing provided by a Swiss-based research organisation concerning affairs in eastern Syria that might affect operations in northern Iraq. It is early evening, and she is already tired.The researcher is young \u2013 late twenties. She has blonde hair and eyes that speak of her excitement at being part of something darker than herself, as though proximity to horror somehow might strengthen her own character. In most cases, though, it\u2019s the opposite. It unravels us. But Marta isn\u2019t about to explain this to her.The girl began her presentation, some thirty minutes ago, by quoting Thierry Lefebvre\u2019s 1927 article \u2018Le vilayet de Mossoul\u2019, telling everyone that \u2018Ninawa is no longer Iraq and not yet Kurdistan\u2019. This remains true, Marta thinks, but as a piece of analysis, sort of leaves you hanging. The girl then seemed to prove Marta\u2019s point \u2013 and not her own \u2013 by focussing the rest of her talk on change and the future rather than on continuity and the past, which was the West\u2019s first error over here\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Marta\u2019s national staff once explained to her \u2013 after she insisted that their annual report be translated into Arabic for the first time \u2013 that almost none of these words (e.g. peace-building, civil liberties, conflict sensitivity, confidence-building measures, resilience, social cohesion) have homologues in Arabic. In fact, the ideas themselves are so foreign and often irrelevant that Arabic speakers, in speaking to one another, simply insert the English term into their conversation. This happens directly in front of Western diplomats, who are oblivious to its significance. Arwood Hobbes is the most outspoken and arguably the most unlikeable of the characters in the book. He received an \u2018other than honourable discharge\u2019 from the army in the Gulf War and is disgruntled, disenfranchised, any number of dis- words, and has a chip on his shoulder and plenty of attitude. In this scene he is talking to Jamal, a local man who is their driver, and Jamal attempts to explain how some of the locals are feeling\u2026..\u2019No one wants to be weak anymore. They are tied of being weak. They want to return to a time when they were strong and united. They cannot stand the humiliation anymore. The West does not understand our humiliation.Arwood replies..\u2019And you think that if these people felt proud and respected, they\u2019d stop packing ice-cream trucks with explosives to kill as many children as possible? They need jobs and a hug?\u2019\u2018I\u2019m saying there are reasons.\u2019\u2018There are always reasons Jamal, but not justifications. Listen, I\u2019ve been watching these douchebags for years. These guys aren\u2019t choosing between a job in auto mechanics and beheading infidels. Yeah, they\u2019re discontented, and maybe they\u2019ve got a good reason too. Fair enough. The thing is, there are a lot of hard-luck cases in the world, and a lot of places on the losing side of history. But not all those places celebrate mass murder because they\u2019re angry. See, little Johnny Hardluck might feel bad one day and say to his mummy, \u2018Mummy, I feel so bad I\u2019m going to cut somebody\u2019s head off.\u2019 That could happen in Pittsburgh. We have psychos, too. But how Mummy responds is kind of what makes one place different from another. So if his mummy says, \u2018That\u2019s a good idea, Johnny, you slice them up real good, and if you die, we\u2019ll be extra proud of you,\u2019 then we know what kind of people we\u2019re dealing with. Around here, you kill a hundred children with an exploding ice-cream truck, and your family gets a pension and its own website. That doesn\u2019t happen in Pittsburgh. That is not a minor distinction. When we act badly, we at least feel really bad about it, and try to find ways to avoid it later. These people do exactly the opposite. That\u2019s why we\u2019re better than them. Got it?\u2019\u2018They are being manipulated by the elites.\u2019\u2018Jamal, you can only manipulate ideas that make sense to people already. If an imam gets on his soapbox and tells all the Sunnis to go out and kill all the New York Yankee fans, they wouldn\u2019t make much headway. Because it wouldn\u2019t make any kind of sense. Go kill the Shiites? That makes sense. Unfortunately everything happening down the mountain, and even up here, makes sense to people, whether they like it or not\u2026..It\u2019s like this Jamal: we will never get along with anyone \u2013 not now, not later, not ever \u2013 if their mamas don\u2019t dance and their daddies don\u2019t rock and roll. Because it\u2019s mind over matter, my friend. And you cannot change people\u2019s minds about what matters.\u2019The author has worked as an international policy analyst, and he has a PhD in International Relations and wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Iraqi war so you get the feeling much of what happens in the book may be a pretty close representation of at least some of the mess that is happening in the Middle East. In some ways it\u2019s not an easy read. There are some really unpleasant scenes where, amongst other things, people are ruthlessly murdered. Overall I came away not quite as invested in the characters and the story as much as I was in Norwegian by Night, but nonetheless I still enjoyed the book immensely."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Anze", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27117957-stephanie-anze", "userReview": "3.5 rounded to 4Its 1991 and Arthur Hobbes is a US soldier manning the line that divides Checkpoint Zulu and the Kuwait border. When Thomas Benton, a British journalist, approaches him, they begin a rather honest conversation about the end of the (Dessert Storm) war and the \"peace\" that follows. Benton mentions he would like to cross the Kuwait border for a few hours, to take some pictures and talk to the locals. Hobbes does not deter him. When he does cross, insurgents attack, chaos ensues and the consequences of their actions will haunt them both.This is the first time I\u00b4ve read a work by Derek B. Miller. Initially, his style did not completely agree with me. Using pop culture references, satire, and wry humor Miller writes a narrative about the war(s) in the Middle East and the US involvement in them. At many times funny and others profound, this novel was different. Arthur Hobbes is either crazy or a genius or maybe both. However, to deny his heart and humanity would be a mistake. Thomas Benton is more grounded and thoughtful. Hobbes and Benton certainly make an interesting duo. This book was as much about the characters as it was about the settings. Ultimately, Miller drives home a powerful point: bringing peace is a complex operation.This novel brought to mind a very fond school memory. I do not recall what grade I was in exactly but in my social studies class we were asked to draw any pictures or symbols that (to us) represented peace. The next day, the drawings were collected.. Each student recieved someone else\u00b4s drawing and was given about ten minutes to do what they wanted to it (short of ripping it up). When the drawings were collected again and given back to their owners, we were told to try to fix them, to the best of our ability. Needless to say, no one could really undo much (one girl had to use quite a bit of white out). After that, my teacher lead us into a discussion about war, peace and the difficulty of transitioning from one to the another. Its an experience that sticks with me to this day."}, {"userName": "Emilie Morscheck", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52169808-emilie-morscheck", "userReview": "Thank you for my giveaway copy!Reading this book was an adventure into the kind of world I'd never experienced before. The war in Iraq mainly occurred while I was a child, and therefore my knowledge of the period is limited. However, I don't a lack of knowledge will stop what intended to be a thriller, not a history lesson. Miller does an excellent job at filling in the gaps, explaining the more important parts of the history of the middle east. His inspiration was borne from his PhD dissertation which concerned the role of media in the war. And this is reflected in the plot and characters.However, I couldn't help but wonder who the main character was supposed to be, and what point Miller was trying to convey. The story frequently shifts between a number of characters but starts with Arwood Hobbes, an American soldier stationed at Checkpoint Zulu. We are never given many insights into his character and his arc feels incomplete. Thomas Benton is our every man, a British journalist with an interest in reporting foreign stories. Quickly he becomes the centre of the story as he is subject to Arwood's schemes. Overall he is a passive character and his motivations are hardly strong enough to justify his position of main character. Marta, the Swedish relief worker is no more than a conduit for Hobbes and Benton to gain access to areas restricted to Westerners. This leaves the girl in green, however the titular character is not really a character, but an idea, a symbol of the brutality. The girl in green is two girls, twenty years apart, simply connected by her garments. The impression I am left with is that this book, which may aesthetically appear as a thriller, (and it certainly is), concerns itself with the side of the world we choose to ignore. Where the brutality doesn't conform with our \"Western\" sensibilities. It aims to tell a story we all know and forces us to acknowledge the truth of the situation. And while I enjoyed these aspects I can't help but feel that The Girl in Green was \"made for Hollywood\"."}, {"userName": "Kasa Cotugno", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345554-kasa-cotugno", "userReview": "Definitely one of the best books of the year, and January's only a week old. Miller wrote one of the best books of recent years, Norwegian by Night, a book that remains years after being read, and this promises to do the same. His first-hand experiences and authorship maturity combine to produce thoughtful books, but Girl in Green is a true rarity -- one that resonates with reports from the nightly news and yet provides insights beyond the camera. The frontpiece provides what will haunt a reader as the story intensifies and becomes almost unbearable in its realistic portrayal of a hostage confrontation with ISIS: \"Inspired by many actual events.\" Just as haunting is a passage toward the end which I'll not divulge since it would be too much of a spoiler. I'll only reveal it's an observation of boundaries and landscape. Kudos."}, {"userName": "L.P.

Twenty years ago, an American soldier and a British journalist found themselves at the ass-end of nowhere in the Iraqi desert. Both bored and looking for purpose, they strayed into a little desert town moments before it became the latest target of Saddam Hussein's wrath, in the aftermath of Desert Storm. They watched Iraqi forces slaughter civilians, pulled one young girl out of the town, and then, as U.S. soldiers stood by ineffectually, the girl was shot.Twenty-two years later, Thomas Benton, the British journalist, gets a phone call from Arwood Hobbes, the American soldier, who got a \"bad paper\" discharge and has been traveling the world ever since. A video of Iraqi villagers being shelled by ISIS that has been broadcast around the world shows a girl in a green dress, moments before she disappears in an explosion. Hobbes believes it's the same girl. Benton knows this is impossible, but as his marriage is falling apart and his career is at a dead end, he calls in the few favors he has left, and goes to Iraq to meet Hobbes.This is a war story, but really more of a post-war story. Both Benton and Hobbes, it becomes clear, were broken by their experience in Iraq twenty-two years ago. Unable to save all the civilians being slaughtered around them, they managed to save one, only to helplessly watch her be murdered after all. The possibility of saving her again, even if it couldn't possibly be the same girl, even if they are chasing a ghost, is what brings them both back to Iraq, and sends them on a suicidal mission into ISIS territory. They are both tightly-wrapped bundles of unacknowledged PTSD, and as their stories unravel along with their psyches we learn what war did to them.While Benton and Hobbes are the main characters, though, the book isn't just about them. As they are repeatedly reminded, by the Swedish NGO officer, by well-intentioned and naive aid workers, and by the Arabs and Kurds around them, many more people are suffering and dying and can't leave. The Westerners know they have it better than the people trapped in these hellish circumstances, but that doesn't make their own hell any less bad. Their mission is one of redemption for themselves more than a real belief they can save one girl, let alone do anything to change the war that has never really stopped.The author doesn't offer any simple answers, or simple characters. Arwood Hobbes acts like a madman, loud-mouthed and spouting BS, except when he isn't, and sometimes coming off as a stereotypically arrogant American jerk with a superiority complex... until we learn just how much he's been doing to try to help the people he was unable to save twenty-two years ago, and how badly he's been damaged. Benton just seems like an old man in his waning years, bitter about never becoming a star journalist, and running away from a difficult relationship with his wife and daughter. Except he's also been badly damaged. The two of them want peace, and are about as likely to find it as anyone still living in Iraq.There are fights, and a few moments of heroics, but the heroics stand out more when they are the acts of bravery by civilians who are armed with nothing but nerve and wits. Some of the heroes are Westerners, others are the Kurds and Iraqis and Yazidis. The villains also range from banal American officers who do nothing and let evil triumph to Iraqi officers who get their hands dirty doing the evil, to ISIS fighters genuinely believing in their bloody jihad.The girl in green is the quintessential MacGuffin. She's just one life in a war zone, but she makes the plot happen. Derek Miller writes a clever, skillful, and sometimes bitterly funny set of multiple stories, telling each character's perspective as they all move towards the climax. I liked this novel better than his first book, Norwegian by Night, which was also a pretty good and unusual story with unusual protagonists. He is showing himself to be an author of some versatility and whose plots are not easily predicted.I am giving it 5 stars, though it's really 4.5 stars - not quite \"OMG awesome!\" or the best book I have read this year, but it's a cut above the books I \"Like but don't absolutely love.\""}, {"userName": "Kerri", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1000125-kerri", "userReview": "Even though this book was brutal it was one of those that I slowed down reading it because I didn't want it to end.

Absolutely one of the most intelligent and interesting reads of late. Extremely informative. The book starts in 1991, Checkpoint Zulu, near the Kuwaiti border--two main characters, a young, sardonic U.S. Army private, Arwood Hobbes, and a more seasoned U.K. journalist, Thomas Benton. Fast forward to 2013 and an entirely different situation and war zone--Syria/Iraq and all that it entails. And, the girl in the green dress that propels the story forward.There is much information here (politics, history) about the complexity of the war situation/zone.

I read it in audio and the narrator was excellent. It is a thriller that takes place in Iraq. It starts at the end of the Desert Storm offensive when the US and allies have entered a cease fire with Iraq. As the US General in charge of the pushing the Iraqis out of Kuwait, Stormin Norman, says later - we were fools to let them keep their helicopters. We were fools for other reasons too. US forces were massed at the border between Kuwait and Iraq. The Iraqi government was taking advantage of the cease fire to engage in killing those who opposed it, along with all the people (men, women, children) in the villages where government opponents were or had been and refugee camps. Private Atwood Hobbes is manning a machine gun post. Thomas Benton is a British journalist embedded with Private Hobbes unit. He wants to go across the border to ask questions; Hobbes wants and ice cream so encourages Benton to go and bring him back an ice cream. Benton goes but while he is in the village, the government helicopters and troops arrive. The village residents who have not already been slaughtered head for the border. The American troops stand on the border watching. Hobbes, feeling responsible for Benton, goes after him. He finds Benton making his way towards the border with a teenage Arab girl in a green dress. But, Hobbes is not the only one who finds Benton and the girl.

When happens when they go to find the girl shall not be disclosed in this review. But there is much action and tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat.But this is far more than a thriller. This is a look at real life in war torn Iraq with its battling schisms. We hear the reality that NGOs face as they try to help the refugees. We also get to see how Hobbes is \"punished\" for what he did in 1991 and how tortured by events he is. And we see how Benton withdraws from his family, starting from the 1991 event.
