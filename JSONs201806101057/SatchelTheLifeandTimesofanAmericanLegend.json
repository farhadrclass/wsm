Love like you've never been hurt. Dance like nobody's watching.\"---Satchel Paige\nNotice that Satchel's name is misspelled.When I was twelve, my Dad found a handful of his Topps baseball cards from the 1950s and gave them to me. Among the cool player\u2019s names were Bob Feller, Yogi Berra, and a lanky black man named Satchel Paige. I pondered on the name Satchel and the name Yogi. How does a guy get a name like Satchel or for that matter Yogi? Later while in college, I was amused to hear that Woody Allen, as a tribute to the great ball player, named his son Satchel Ronan O\u2019Sullivan Farrow, although calling Ronan Woody\u2019s child is a bit of a stretch. I\u2019m of the opinion, shared by many others, that he is actually Frank Sinatra\u2019s son. Ronan doesn\u2019t go by Satchel, which could be because he doesn\u2019t like it, or it could be because he has some issues with his \u201cfather.\u201d I hope he understands that he was named after a baseball legend.It wasn\u2019t until I read this book that some possibilities for the origins of Leroy Page evolving into Satchel Paige became known to me. (He added an i to his last name because he thought it added some panache.) As a boy, Leroy worked at the train station in Mobile, Alabama, carrying satchels for passengers. One story is that he designed a pole that would go over his shoulders that allowed him to carry more satchels at one time and, therefore, make more money. That is the sanitized story. The other story is that he was light fingered and quick enough to \u201cliberate\u201d satchels from passengers. I tend to lean towards the later since it was only a few years later that he found himself at reformatory school. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. He traded five years of his life to learn how to play baseball. Satchel was an enigma. Nearly every time he was asked for his birth date, whether by reporters or for official documents, he gave a different date, usually a date that made him younger than his actual age. Later when asked about his marriage date, he did the same thing, slinging a different date out there each time. It was as if he were trying to keep anything real to be known about Leroy safely tucked in the shadows of the larger than life Satchel. He was a phenom. He\u2019d have to be coming from Mobile, Alabama, and having the wrong tint in the wrong time. He was told by owners and managers his whole life, \u201dIf only you were white.\u201d He was a superstar for the Negro leagues. His fastball was nearly unhittable until he hurt his arm in the late 1930s. The great Joe DiMaggio had a chance to bat against him and said he was \"the best and fastest pitcher I've ever faced.\" He became the star that fans attending Negro games most wanted to see. He was a showman. He embellished, bragged, and most importantly delivered. Modesty was not a word he was very familiar with. \nSatchel played wherever someone would pay him to play. He skipped out on contracts when he got better offers. He went to other countries to play if the offer was too irresistible. Given the fact that he spent money as fast as he could make it, he was forced to keep hustling. He made a better living than most white major leaguers by barnstorming across the country. He put his black All-stars up against some of the best of the major leaguers in exhibition games. The crowds came out to see this crazy, spaghetti legged pitcher with size fourteen feet pitch. He would raise his front foot so far into the air before he pitched that, as one player put it, \u201che temporarily blotted out the sun.\u201d As innings of pitching mounted (everyone wanted to see Satchel pitch every game), he developed some arm saving pitches that also resulted in some embarrassing swings from big leaguers. \u201dI got bloopers, loopers, and droopers. I got a jump ball, a be ball, a screw ball, a wobbly ball, a whispy-dispy-do, a hurry-up ball, a nothin\u2019 ball and a bat dodger.\u201dIf the world was a fair place, he would have been the first black to integrate into major league baseball, and though he supported Jackie Robinson publicly, privately he was hurt. He understood that he was \u201dold-school, while the twenty-six-year-old Robinson was a college boy and army veteran who the owner felt could bear the ruthless scrutiny of being first.\u201dNobody did more to advance the idea that black men could compete on the same diamond equally with white men as Satchel Paige. He proved it every time he put on his cleats and toed the mound. Black people came to see him pitch in droves, but so did white people. \nThe Dapper Satchel Paige.Another reason why Satchel may not have been the best choice to be first was the fact that he was a notorious womanizer. Single women, married women, black women, and white women flocked to him in whatever city he played in, and he enjoyed their company. He used to leave tickets at the box office of every game for \u201cMrs. Paige\u201d and it tickled the other players that every day a different woman picked those tickets up. He was a man who enjoyed good food, women, music, fine clothes, and burned through a pile of money in the process. Though white players were enjoying the same benefits, a black man, especially the first integrated ball player, would have made fans uncomfortable that he was being seen with white women. Not to mention the very real possibility that some morons in some states would be looking for him with a rope. He did finally make the major leagues as a 42 year old rookie for the Cleveland Indians. To this day he is still the oldest rookie ever in major league baseball. At age 59, he was hired for one game for the Boston Red Sox as a stunt to raise attendance. A crowd packed the stadium, and \u201dhe needed twenty-eight tosses to get nine outs. He struck out one and walked none over three innings. Batters popped up his pitches and tapped meek grounders. The only base hit was a double by Carl Yastrzemski.\u201d He was stripping down in the locker room when a player came down to tell him he had to come back out. The darkened stadium was filled with lit matches and lighters as the audience serenaded him with The Old Gray Mare.\nI really love this picture of Satchel Paige. He is a tired warrior.One interesting thing that no one could have anticipated with the integration of baseball was that only the very best black players were given spots on teams. Average players were more likely to be white. The end result was that, as the Negro leagues shut down, there were fewer black men making a living playing baseball. Satchel called for integration of baseball for decades before Jackie Robinson was even playing. He proved every year that men of color could play the game as well as white men. He endured racism as he travelled across this country, entertaining black and white fans of the game. Sometimes hotels who would host blacks could not be found. Sometimes only dives could be found where regularly the whole team slept in one room. The players learned to sleep with newspapers under them to keep the bugs from nesting with them. (The rustling of his natural movements while sleeping would scare the bugs back into the walls.) Sometimes finding food was difficult because no one would serve the black players; some who would had them stand back in the kitchen to eat. Satchel was a shrewd negotiator in an age when most players were just glad to have a job. He knew his value and asked for it. He was the first black man to pitch in a World Series game. He was a man of firsts, and if he had been able to play in his prime in the major leagues, the Cy Young award might very well be called the Satchel Paige award. It was odd for me to be reaching back in time to the child I was in 1979 when I first held a Satchel Paige baseball card. I\u2019ve been curious about the man for thirty-seven years. He has cropped up here and there in other books I\u2019ve read. I\u2019m not sure why it has taken me this long to give the man a voice in my head. Whatever inkling I had of who he was when I first learned his name, it was nothing compared to the man that I\u2019ve met while reading this book.\u201dLeroy became Satchel. And Satchel became a legend.\u201dIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visithttp://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Marla", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4021000-marla", "userReview": "As a baseball fan this was a very enjoyable book for me. I enjoyed learning about Satchel Paige who was a fantastic ball player who pushed the boundaries his entire life. Living in Kansas City and knowing the President of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, I've heard stories over the years about the Monarchs, Satchel Paige and Buck O'Neil. Buck was a supporter of the organization where I work and I missed meeting him by a few months. So, I recognize several names in this book. If you are in Kansas City, love baseball, stop by the Museum, it has a lot of fascinating history. This book does jump around a lot but it has so much history and information that I want to know more about Satchel and about the Negro Leagues. Glad I found this on the shelf at the library. If you like baseball and the history of baseball, definitely pick this up."}, {"userName": "Leroy Seat", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2254275-leroy-seat", "userReview": "As a lifelong baseball fan and a person who believes in racial equality and the importance of respecting all people, this book was a good read. It was about baseball but also about the struggle for racial equality and respect.The book probably could have been better organized and the story being told in a non-chronological manner bothered me some--and some of the content seemed a little contradictory. But the book is written in good prose; it flowed well and was a joy to read.Satchel was certainly a colorful figure. He was not a man without faults, and there were aspects of his way of living I did not like. But for the most part he was not only a man with great ability as a baseball player but also a man who was able to cope and even to thrive in very difficult circumstances."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth K.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k", "userReview": "This was decent enough, and certainly an interesting subject. I have a lot of sympathy for the author, for it was apparent that he was caught up in a very understandable quandary involving how much background to include. Can you understand the career of Satchel Paige without understanding the Negro Leagues and can you understand the Negro Leagues without understanding Jim Crow and on and on. It landed in one of those places that is probably too much for some readers and not nearly enough for others, but what do you do? I felt this was a good overview of Paige's career and it offered a Satchel-centric view of the desegregation of modern major league baseball, which I would say was 80% thoughtful and only 20% whiny, not a terrible split although it skated a little close to calling Branch Rickey an opportunist and Jackie Robinson an ingrate. I was also somewhat alarmed at the willingness to lump together Paige's tall-tales about his early days in baseball, his dissembling about his age, and his willingness to marry someone when he was already married to another person as several examples of the self-creation of a folksy mythology. Hey, maybe they are are aspects of a folksy mythology, but Tye should have made some sort of case for this. In the absence of any convincing argument, I'm going to go with the tall-tales (throwing a ball so far that the catcher caught it the following day) being, you know, stories told for entertainment value that were clearly not intended to be believed; the age issue being evidence that he needed to lie about his age in order to continue making an income, which could start up a discussion about whether lying is an acceptable way of avoiding discrimination; and the getting married more than once thing, oh, let's call that one bigamy. Maybe I'm crazy but these seem like three very different things.Baseball-wise, there is a lot of good information and you get a great mental picture of Paige's career, especially the barnstorming years, and you are left with a real churn about the absolute unfairness of it all."}, {"userName": "Doreen Petersen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24442706-doreen-petersen", "userReview": "Outstanding read!

Satchel threw so fast, sometimes the ball disappeared before it reached the catcher's mitt to the astonishment of everyone at the park. Now that is fast! 2. Satchel threw so fast, sometimes if a batter was lucky enough for his bat to strike the ball, the wood would start on fire. I ain't never seen no modern pitcher do that. Owner Bill Veek came out of this book quite well. I always liked the guy. Jackie Robinson not so well. All of the black ball players who deserved a chance to play had to wait. Maybe it needed an asshole like Jackie to put up with the taunts and not react, at least not at the beginning.Some Satchel quotes: 1. How old would you be if you didn't know how old you are?2.

To this end, Tye researched Paige's life thoroughly, scrutinizing source documents from birth records to FBI files and conducting more than 200 interviews with Paige's family and friends. Tye's fondness for his subject is obvious, but that doesn't prevent him from debunking the myths surrounding Paige's life. However, a couple of critics felt that Tye was still too credulous, and others considered some of his arguments a bit tenuous.

If I had no choice but to study American sports I'd likely choose baseball (\"for it is our game\" goes Whitman), and to pick an angle on baseball history to research, it would definitely be how race relations operated in baseball in the middle of the 20th century. Since I did have a choice though, I picked this book out anyway because I wanted to try something out of my comfort zone, read something that might offer an essential piece of American history that I would not otherwise have sought out.Satchel Paige is a fantastic subject matter, as I soon learned. Both the man and the legend, the interplay between the real person and the cultural icon. His overspending habits and infidelities, his cockiness, his traveling spirit, supreme pitching skill. Dude's a complex character who Tye never downplays in his imperfections, his downright cruelties even, but who Tye also acknowledges as a singular force in baseball history. Tye's characterization of Satchel is neither irredeemable nor glorified. Rather, what was bad is admitted as bad and what was good is admitted as good. I loved one particular passage that describes how, when pitching to a 4-year-old fan, Satchel didn't do the expected underhand toss, but threw a damn fast ball. The idea of it is bizarre, funny, and mean, and encompasses a lot that one could both love and hate about the guy.The later sections of this book reminded me a lot of another biography I read recently, Douglas Brinkley's Rosa Parks. Specifically, how these works reminds us that our cultural icons and heroes continue to exist after they're shifted out of the limelight. I'm always interested in learning about the \"fade out\" of one's career, whether or not they recuperate, whether or not they ever thought to save enough to support themselves out of the public eye, etc.Unfortunately, also like Brinkley's work, Tye's biography also has an offputting distance to it. This is likely because both authors were white men. Now, Brinkley's just an amazing historian and Tye has experience writing about black people and black men more specifically in his book Rising From the Rails: Pullman Porters and the Making of the Black Middle Class, but I still feel like there's something underexplored in their work on black subjects precisely because race isn't the first thing on their minds.Satchel is still probably the most factual and holistic biography of Satchel Paige, so for that it is absolutely worth reading. My reservations about this book are abstract and possibly subjective, but it comes down to one simple feeling: I didn't feel like we got down to the \"spirit\" of Satchel Paige in this book. I think it records him and his legend splendidly, from his inimitable stats to his personal faults and triumphs, but I'm not so sure we got to what was essentially Satchel Paige here."}, {"userName": "Steven Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson", "userReview": "This is a well written biography of baseball legend Satchel Paige. He was finally admitted into the \"Negro League\" wing, a separate area of Cooperstown from the \"real\" Hall of Fame.This ably constructed book, authored by Larry Tye, traces Paige's bittersweet life from birth to death. We see how he grew up and how he began to create his own persona (his last name morphed from Page to Paige, for example).He began playing professional baseball in the Negro Leagues in Chattanooga in 1926. Early on, his strong right arm made an impression. His career progressed, until he joined the mighty Pittsburgh Crawfords, which included such greats as Cool Papa Bell, Judy Johnson, Oscar Charleston, and Josh Gibson. Early on, Paige enjoyed spending money at a pace greater than the amount that he earned. This was a practice for most of his life, leading to a rather lugubrious period of time in the latter part of his life, when he was unable to support himself and his family very well and would do almost anything to earn a buck.One way of earning extra money? Jumping teams to go with someone who would pay more. Or barnstorming in the winter against teams led by major leaguers such as Dizzy Dean. Or playing ball in the Caribbean area. Given how many innings Ol' Satch pitched, it is stunning that he only suffered serious arm trouble once.His career on the downside, he finally had a chance to play major league baseball, when Bill Veeck signed him to play with the Cleveland Browns. Although past his peak, he provided valuable pitching in the team's pennant run. He played for several more years in the big leagues before he was let go. After that, minor league pitching, barnstorming, and the like. His final major league performance was with the Oakland Athletics (under the ownership of the colorful Charles Finley).This isn't just a book about Satchel Paige as a baseball player. It also explores his (sometimes less than admirable) relationships with women, his distance from many of the people he worked with, a kind of lone wolf approach (he would drive managers nuts by not riding from one city to another with the team, but by driving his own car).Again a fine book about the bittersweet life of Satchel Paige. Well worth looking at if you have an interest in the subjects covered here."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175087-brian", "userReview": "Probably the saying most often attributed to Satchel Paige is \"Don't look back. Something might be gaining on you.\" But one of his I like even better than that is \"Work like you don't need money. Love like you've never been hurt. And dance like no one is watching.\" Not bad words to live by, coming from someone with almost no formal schooling.Satchel Paige was definitely a true American Legend, for the way he played baseball (blackball in the Jim Crow era, and then later in the Major Leagues) and for the way he chose to fight the racism of his day. And what made this book interesting was that he was very human, with lots of faults and idiosyncrasies. Though he was decidedly less than faithful to his wives during his three marriages, he was nevertheless devoted to his children, working well past his prime to keep them fed and to pay their tuition to their schools, all the way through college for those of his seven children who chose that path.His story is also extremely interesting, since he spent almost all his playing days toiling in the Negro Leagues before the Major League color barrier was finally broken. I found his career in the Negro Leagues very interesting, as well as his career as a player in his mid- to late 40's in the Major Leagues.I recommend this book to anyone interested in American history and the history of the American pastime.

He literally pitched his way out of poverty during his childhood in Mobile, Alabama, rising quickly to the top of the negro leagues. He became a top drawer wherever he went and was literally baseball's first free agent. He knew his worth and commanded impressive earnings. Satchel felt throughout his career he had good enough stuff to excel in the major leagues. Unfortunately, when he finally was called up in 1948 by the Cleveland Indians, he was in his late 40's and not the dominant powerhouse he once was. As Buck O'Neil so aptly summed it up, \"Don't feel sorry for us, I feel sorry for your fathers and your mothers, because they didn't get to see us play.\" He apparently handled the indignities of Jim Crow with surprising grace, regardless of his true feelings. I give this book 5 stars partly for the effort the author obviously put into this biography. Satchel Paige's life was a legend, crafted by himself, a creator of tall tales and embellishments, and also due to incomplete recordkeeping during his early years in the negro leagues. Newspapers and periodicals also contributed their own fantastic yarns.

The stories in this book show Satchel as both an extremely talented athlete, who paved the way for breaking the Major Leagues color barrier and a flawed, hard living everyman. One of my favorite stories is of a batter facing Satchels' pitching who didn't wait for a strikeout call. He walked back to the dugout after taking two called strikes, saying to his manager, \"I didn't see the first two. What makes you think I'm going to hit a third one?\"  Many interviews and in depth research are pieced together to tell this tale.

The black Yogi Berra, if you will.Tye's excellent biography reveals a complicated man who is perhaps the greatest pitcher ever seen in the 150 years of organized baseball, who had survived poverty and reform school with humor and good graces, while at the same time surviving and suffering under Jim Crow racism that seemingly dogged every step of his never-ending career. There is much to unpack in that description:Leroy \"Satchel\" Paige was a complicated man, a motor-mouthed storyteller who relished his privacy, a supreme individualist who lived and played baseball by his own rules yet made all his team mates better and might have made a great manager if given the chance, a money-chasing womanizer who loved nothing better than fishing between games on the road and frying up his catch on a hot plate in his hotel room. Tye brings all these facets into the book, giving three-dimensional depth to the cartoonish caricature that Paige is often portrayed to represent.What about that \"greatest pitcher ever\" claim? Well, Tye does a yeoman's job of pulling together data from dozens of teams in several leagues at every level and in several countries, often from times and places where statistical recordkeeping was an often-forgotten afterthought. The records from organized leagues that Tye has compiled are astounding, particularly his strikeout-to-walks ratio which testifies to pinpoint control to go with his laser speed and mark him as a true pitcher and not just a very athletic but freakish speedball sideshow. All the stats Tye can confirm don't match Paige's own claims: 2,500 games pitched, 2,000 victories, 300 shutouts, 50 no-hitters, 105 mph fastball. The numbers varied from story to story, but witnesses--team members, opponents, fans, owners and umpires--could and did corroborate enough of them to make us take a fresh look at how good Paige was--and how good he might have been playing a full career against Major League competition. Tye never draws a conclusion, but quotes modern baseball historians and statistical experts who put Paige on the short list for best-ever consideration with the best-known names in the Hall of Fame.All this from the poverty-level boy from a shotgun shack in Mobile, Alabama. Paige did survive poverty and reform school (for truancy, street thefts, and shoplifting from the five-and-dime) with humor and good graces, and Tye tells this story well; although we might want more details, there probably isn't much more to be had. In the reform school (for \"Juvenile Negro Law-breakers:\" in those separate but equal days) he realized the seriousness of his situation, and had his own awakening when for the first time he played baseball under the watchful eye of a coach, and a coach who recognized his ability and love for the game and harnessed both to an ambition that propelled him to . . .. . . .the top of a severely circumscribed world--\"blackball\" in the Negro Leagues and barnstorm touring in haphazardly organized tournaments and leagues that were decidedly not Major. The backbone of Tye's story is this account of how Paige survived while suffering under Jim Crow racism that locked him out of the best competition for the first twenty years of his career, Tye documents Paige's sometimes mercurial comings and goings, his constantly cavalier treatment of contracts and rules, and his sometimes unsportsmanike treatment of opponents and teammates alike as his ways of dealing with the racist constraints on his talents and ability to make money with it that strongly grated on this proud and powerful man throughout his life. He did what he had to do to survive and make a living the only way he knew how and did it with a greater level of grace and good humor than most of us could have mustered under those circumstances.In the end, Paige did get a brief shining chance at the Major Leagues, was finally inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame (not without one last gratuitous and painful racist jab), and he was finally recognized for both his ability, his wit, and his survival to the end of a long career and life. Tye's book adds to the recognition and realization of the complete man behind the caricature."}, {"userName": "Jim Leffert", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2735643-jim-leffert", "userReview": "Satchel Paige\u2019s story is irresistible to anyone who loves baseball or who is interested in American history. His story, remarkable in itself, is intertwined with the colorful history of the Negro Leagues and of the efforts by African-American and white sportswriters and others to integrate Major League Baseball. His story is already well told in a previous biography, Don\u2019t Look Back: Satchel Paige in the Shadows by Mark Ribowsky. Larry Tye\u2019s fine and thorough (at times, though, perhaps too thorough) biography covers much the same ground, but throughout the book, he fills out the picture some in linking Satchel\u2019s story to currents in African-American history. For example, he describes the efforts by Negro community leaders to establish reform schools to help wayward youths in Southern communities. It was one of these schools that rescued Satchel from street life in Mobile and set him on the path to immortality as a pitcher. He situates Satchel as a disciple of Booker T. Washington, as opposed to W.E.B. DuBois, in his approach to dealing with racial segregation. This led some people to view Satchel as an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d during the Civil Rights Era. Also, he connects Satchel\u2019s life story to the overall struggles and efforts of African Americans to leave behind poverty and enjoy, when possible, the trappings of the good life in America. One difference between Tye\u2019s and Ribowski\u2019s books is that Tye offers a less positive portrayal of Bob Feller, the Hall of Famer who organized barnstorming teams of white Major League Players that played against Satchel and other Negro League era players. Although Feller later talked and wrote about his respect for Satchel, at the time he made condescending remarks about Satchel and the other players\u2019 abilities."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony", "userReview": "I love baseball. I love books about baseball. And...Satchel Paige! How can someone screw this up? But, this was not great writing. And, if anything, Satchel Paige is diminished in my mind by this book, which I doubt was the author's intent. At times, the author is investigative reporter, tracking down once and for all the date of Paige's birth. At other times he glides over obvious apocrypha, like the story about a pitch Paige threw, everyone saw it, that no one saw caught. And the last chapter, in the manner of an epilogue, summarizes the last 250 pages.Still, it's Satchel Paige...and there are some great stories told.

While I can appreciate the amount of research that went into the writing of this and the sifting process that it must have taken, I didn't care much for the way it was given. Satch sounded like a very colorful and very charming person. I wish the writing was also equal to that.I did the audio and that might have had something to do with how this settled with me.

His frustrationsdealing with racism and segregation make his story all the more amazing. I remember watching Willie Mays play in the early 1960's. But I did not realize at the time that blacks had been allowed in the majors only 15 years earlier. Larry Tye makes a great case that Paige, not Robinson, should have been the first black player in the majors."}, {"userName": "Douglas Graney", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1443257-douglas-graney", "userReview": "I'm always impressed with writers that demonstrate great research.

Larry Tye's Satchel: The Life and Times of an American Legend did not disappoint. It showed what a heroic and tragic figure he was, and how important for the game.Of course, the book is framed by the Jim Crow South and how Satchel navigated it. Spurned later by Jackie Robinson, Satchel felt he should get more credit for being at the forefront of integration, actually playing with whites in games and getting the respect of fellow barnstormers Dizzy Dean and Bob Feller, both white baseball legends. He played everywhere and for anyone who would pay him, pitching constantly and often drawing white crowds. At the same time, like all African American players he had to find safe houses to sleep in and black restaurants to eat in. In many respects, he and other Negro League stars paved the way for Jackie.He chased money constantly and Tye is careful to show how that sometimes was unethical (like skipping contracts) but that most often it was Satchel showing that he was worth money and therefore wasn't going to be pushed around because of his skin color. He made tons of money in his career, though he squandered most of it. Later in life the chasing became sad, as he was invited to hotels and ordered room service and liquor to bring home because he was out of cash.His family life was complicated and also sometimes terrible--he was married to two women at one time at one point and one of them eventually committed suicide. He left a trail of women and at least one child he never knew. He had a lot of children and tended to be uneven in raising them. His third wife stayed with him until the end, when his health and spirits failed him.The baseball part is incredible. He pitched as an old man in the majors and did pretty well. As an MLB rookie in his 40s he still threw bullets. We have few records because no one recorded the vast majority of his games, but he was one of the best pitchers ever. Tye captures him well.BTW, you can listen to Tye talk about the book on the excellent Baseball by the Book podcast.From http://weeksnotice.blogspot.com/2018/..."}, {"userName": "Sherrie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2755546-sherrie", "userReview": "Back in the '60s, I read Satchel Paige's (ghostwritten) autobiography, \"Maybe I'll Pitch Forever\", which began a lifelong interest in both baseball and baseball history. \"Satchel\" is much more informative, almost without question more accurate, but a lot less entertaining.The first half of the book is extremely heavy on stats (and given how many teams Paige played for, there was probably no way around that), and it dragged. The best part of this book is the various reactions when Jackie Robinson was selected to break baseball's color barrier. Very interesting reading. The second half of the book, while containing stats, dealt much more with Paige personally, and was a lot more entertaining.I came across many quotes which Larry Tye attributed to Paige that I have seen attributed to many other sources. I tend to believe that, as I don't think Satchel could have been the source for ALL of these sayings. There is no denying, though, what an entertaining and influential figure Paige was. As Tye said at one point, \"Jackie Robinson was the door, but Satchel Paige was the key that opened it.\"Highly recommended for any baseball fan, or anyone with an interest in Jim Crow history."}, {"userName": "Terynce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7036039-terynce", "userReview": "Too long by half! No organization, no plan. This book read like a young Satchel on the mound only it wouldn't improve like Satchel did. One of the all time greats, maybe the greatest, and he performed feats that are only borderline believable and larger than life. When he was good, he was unreal. The book was a meandering morass of statistics, quotes, and stories. Worth a skim if you are a baseball fan, but I won't rate it higher than that. The most interesting part for me was the unintended consequences of Jackie Robinson being called up to MLB. Black fans couldn't watch him play in person and that changed the sense of community they shared."}, {"userName": "Bill O'driscoll", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3035789-bill-o-driscoll", "userReview": "Fine bio of the baseball great, as well detailed and documented as could be imagined given that the pitcher played most of his career in 30s and 40s in the Negro leagues, where record-keeping was spotty and tall tales grew like summer corn. It's a winning portrait of an original character, with good analysis of Satch's relationship to other players, to owners (breaking contracts like they were eggshells, he was a self-made free agent decades before the term existed) and to the segregated (and later, desegregated) major leagues. It was a good pick for my annual baseball book and I think a necessary addition to any baseball library."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5983706-andrew", "userReview": "Because so much of Satchel Paige's legend and career is mythical - the author tries to figure out what is real and what is made up. I enjoyed this book a good deal, but the author's occasional move out of chronological order was a bit odd at times. I thought the last couple chapters, about Paige finally entering the Major Leagues and his retirement, were some of the best ones in the book. Solid read for anyone interested in baseball history."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18846663-mike", "userReview": "Informative and pretty readable. I learned some things and it did give a good feeling of what the Negro Leagues were like to play in, as well as just being black in the early 20th century.The only negative is the slightly haliographic view towards Paige. Tye throws out the stats and tries to extrapolate it to compare to major leagues. He gives lip service to the variable competition Paige faced but then ignored it to say the stats show that Paige was the greatest.
