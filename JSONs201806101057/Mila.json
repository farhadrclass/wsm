I read this book when it first came out back in 1961, and I decided to read it again just this past month. This is a really powerful novel, not for the faint hearted. What was so amazing is what these poor Jewish people suffer through. I could hardly put this book down once I started reading it again. I give it five stars.

It is a novel of love and hate , of destruction and redemption , of much that is tragic and horrific as well triumph of the human spirit . It is an intense human drama.But most of all it contains an important lesson for the past and present , a lesson more important today than ever.Fundamentally this is a story of the Jewish people, and about the hatred the Jewish people have survived at a time when the dark and hideous forces of anti-Semitism are reemerging on a scale unknown since Hitler's Third Reich, under the guise of anti-Zionism or hatred of Israel.This is a story about how the Jewish people where persecuted and massacred at will in every land in which they where strangers, because they did where deprived of a homeland of their own .Always at the darkest hours of the holocaust the one redeeming factor is the desire for the rebirth of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel.Indeed the movement that keeps the Jewish people alive is Zionism!The same dream that many evil forces today are working to destroy.When the Jewish children are being taken to their deaths in the Nazi vehicles, what keeps them alive a little longer is the dream living in the tiny land of Israel, then known by the colonial name of Palestine.It is this dream that provides the only hope at all when we read of a rachitic three year old girl in filthy rags being shot dead by a Nazi officer, as she desperately ties to retrieve her torn baby doll from under his boot.Another lesson of the book is the gross indifference to the world of the genocide of Jews. Is this really any different +to the equanimity of the world to the mass killing of Jews today by Palestinian terrorists in Israel , on an almost daily basis ? In a sense there is an even greater perversion by the world today, as most of the world, often led by those considered the most `progressive, shrilly condemn Israel and Jews for defending themselves. Condemn the Jewish people for wanting to survive, for the chance of succeeding where the Jews of the Warsaw ghetto failed.Take these lines:`Jews where charred into unrecognizable smoldering corpses.Jews where roasted in bunkers, which where turned into coffins by wind shifts and downdrafts.Jews where choked to death in clouds of smoke which crushed their lungs.'Is this any different to what is going on today every day in Israel, with the bombing of Jews by Arabs .The German officer Horst Von Epp , warns the Nazi's of the consequences of their holocaust , the disaster that will be brought upon them , and about the mark of shame that will stain their memory.The same warning must be made to those who are acting against Israel and the Jews today"}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45632570-tim", "userReview": "This began like one of those 1980s epic TV series when the subject matter is fascinating but the script and acting awful. The author gets carried away with every character's back story and he shows us in superfluous and often syrupy detail scenes that could have been told in a sentence or two. However once he had settled into his grove and the war narrative began it was a compelling read. He gives us the Warsaw Ghetto from the perspective of both the Jews and the Nazis with the odd Pole thrown in too, culminating in the heroic uprising. Leon Uris isn't the best writer in the world but he did a brilliant job of comprehensively researching his subject and the story is gripping."}, {"userName": "indiefishsteak", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41135-indiefishsteak", "userReview": "It has been a very long time since I read this book. It had a profound effect on me, and for that I have marked it as amazing. Though I'm not certain how fond I would be of it now, I think that it made me search my soul for certain answers about humanity, its strengths and weaknesses. In short it is about war, genocide, the human spirit, and taking a stand even when you know the action is futile.

Not great literature, however, his books are all page-turners and can be very emotional wrenching.

I had first read the book when it came out in 1962. It was powerful then, even more so today. The most moving lines ... \"For the first time I am proud of being a Jew\" ... \"you must survive and be part of the State of Israel\" ... resonated with me as a Jew and as an author who has written about Jews. My grandparents lived near Warsaw; they left in the early 1900s; their families stayed and were murdered by the Germans. Despite what I view as sincere efforts on the part of contemporary Germans, and thier collaborators in other countries, to recognize and atone for the horrendous deed of their ancestors, it is hard for me to forgive.

I learned a wealth of information about the situation of Jews in and around Warsaw before and during WW II and was reminded to \"never forget.\" I used the term mind boggling because enjoyable is too light of an adjective to describe such horror juxtaposed to kindness, love to hate, and good to evil.One of the many things I enjoy about Uris's books is the way he describes and develops his characters and the various situations in which they're involved. He introduces the reader to Gabriela, Andre, Paul Bronski, Deborah, Chris deMonti, and several others in the beginning of the novel, and then as the book progresses you see even more of their many dimensions. For example, you might think that Gabby is a social butterfly, spoiled and pampered. You'd be wrong. She's a strong person, a loyal one too, especially to Andre but to the others as well. And then there's Koenig, a mean and malevolent person.Members of my writing group are fond of saying, \"Show, don't tell,\" and Uris is a master of showing. No one can read Mila 18 without seeing, hearing, and smelling the sights, sounds, and odors of the battlefield, the underground ghetto, and the sewer. I saw the children eating chocolate on their way to a concentration camp, felt revolted by Stutze's brutal murder of Max Kleperman, and smelled and \"tasted\" the murky sewer gas swirling around up to my neck.Uris also reminds his readers that even in the most horrid of conditions, there is love, honor, and strength. Deep love exists between several couples, and the descriptions of their moments together are poignant. Honor, integrity, and strength are described time after time in the actions of the Jewish people themselves as they struggle against the cruelty directed towards them."}, {"userName": "Nathan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1215159-nathan", "userReview": "I read Mila 18 immediately after Armageddon and I thought they made a great combination. Everyone has heard of the Warsaw Ghetto but I never quite understood just what happened there. This book was a great illustration of that bit of history. Again, the novel is about people in inhuman conditions trying to find some hope for the future, refusing to be trodden under the boots of megalomaniacs. But as we know from history the events in Warsaw were a horror and a tragedy so be prepared for another gut-wrenching ending."}, {"userName": "Janice Decker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5854816-janice-decker", "userReview": "Ah, the benefit of age and experience. I read this book when it was first published in the 60s and thought it was wonderful. I see now that what I got from it was incredibly deep research into the story of the resistance of the Warsaw Ghetto. While that story is compelling and heartbreaking, I wonder if Mila 18 could even be classified today as a \"novel.\" The characters are two dimensional and serve essentially as plot devices rather than as real people. Even in historical novels, character should drive plot, not the other way around, and in Mila 18, the plot drives the people. I'd also forgotten the large chunks of exposition in which Uris shares with us his research notes. While I certainly appreciated re-learning the history of the growth of Zionism and lots of detail about the Polish Army, Uris was given wide latitude by his publisher. He was, of course, a best selling author but still: this time around, I skimmed and skipped entire chapters. Despite the intense subject matter, this time the book was boring. The characters were not only two dimensional, but they keenly reflected the stereotypes of the 60s.We've come a long way in understanding and depicting human beings."}, {"userName": "Armin Hennig", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8212255-armin-hennig", "userReview": "54 von 100 f\u00fcr dieses Meisterwerk des zionistischen Realismus. Aufgerundet auf drei Sterne wegen der deutlichen Steigerung gegen\u00fcber Exodus, bei dem es sich um ein ziemlich wirres Sammelsurium von Reportage, zionistischer Propaganda und Superheldenmythos gehandelt hatte. Allerdings geh\u00f6rten die Kapitel mit der Lebensgeschichte Dov Landaus und dem Ghettoaufstand zu den zu kurz gekommenen Aktivposten des Welterfolgs.Im Vergleich mit dem Kuddelmuddel Exodus, in dem zuletzt so ziemlich jeder Erz\u00e4hlfaden verloren ging, ist die zionistische Umn\u00e4hung der Muster des sozialistischen Realismus durch einen militanten Antikommunisten schon eine kreative Meisterleistung. Abgesehen von den ausgew\u00e4hlten historischen Fakten folgt Uris getreu dem in der Tolstoj-Nachfolge kreiierten Schnittmuster, nur dass eben die Juden hier die Kommunisten sind, die den zuk\u00fcnftigen Sieg und die sp\u00e4tere Staatsgr\u00fcndung immer schon im Hintergrund haben, auch wenn die Reaktion in dieser Phase noch mal einen Pyrrhus-Sieg feiern darf. Hauptheld und Supermann Andrej ist in Sachen Kampfkraft ein Ari Ben Kanaan-Klon, da er aber auch eine Wende vom polnischen Patrioten zum Zionisten durchmacht, handelt es sich um eine typische Tolstoj- bzw. SR-Figur. Der amerikanisch-italienische Journalist Chris de Monti ist die zweite, schw\u00e4chere Heldenfigur, ein entt\u00e4uschter Idealist, der aus verschm\u00e4hter Liebe zeitweise auf die falsche Seite ger\u00e4t, mit der \u00dcbermittlung des ersten Berichts \u00fcber die Vernichtungslager letztlich wieder auf die richtige Seite zur\u00fcck kehrt.Chris wird von seinem zeitweiligen Nazig\u00f6nner, dem dauergeilen Propagandisten von Epp h\u00f6chstpers\u00f6nlich im Ghetto abgeladen, als der ihm auf die Schliche kommt, weil der den SS-Schergen nichts g\u00f6nnt und schon \u00fcber das Kriegsende hinaus denkt. Von Epp ist so etwas wie die verlorene Seele auf der Naziseite, der Medientechnokrat, wie man heute sagen w\u00fcrde, hat an den Mythen \u00fcber die Juden mitgestrickt, verachtet aber die Nazis und verspottet sogar die lange Zeit vergeblichen M\u00fchen das Ghetto aufzul\u00f6sen. Derartige gewissenlose Besserwisser geh\u00f6ren auch zum Arsenal einschl\u00e4giger weltanschaulicher Literatur, genauso wie der zum Judenrat verkommene Ex-Professor Paul Bronski, f\u00fcr den sein pers\u00f6nliches Fortkommen und die eigene Geltungssucht an erster Stelle steht, so dass er zum willigen Vollstrecker der Deporatationsbefehle wird und dar\u00fcber die Achtung seiner Familie verliert, die samt und sonders in den Widerstand geht. Da es sich um ein zionistisches Buch und nicht um ein politische korrektes Machwerk handelt, nimmt Uris auch beschnittene Ungl\u00e4ubige und Unbelehrbare aufs Korn, die noch aus jeder Notlage ihren Schnitt machen m\u00fcssen. Zu diesem Abschaum, der s\u00e4mtliche Vorurteile der Nazis bedient geh\u00f6rt der Ganev Max Kleppermann, der f\u00fcr neue Rekordgewinne zahlreiche Hungertote unter seinen Mitjuden in Kauf nimmt, ehe ihm die Nazis seine Auslandskonten und sein Leben nehmen. Nicht minder faszinierend ist der unter Exzemen und Impotenz leidenden Chef des j\u00fcdischen Ordnungdienstes, Warsinski, der einst aus Protest gegen seine elende j\u00fcdische Kindheit katholisch geworden war, ehe ihn die Rassenpolitik der Nazis unter die Juden zur\u00fcck warf. Als Herr \u00fcber Leben und Tod l\u00e4sst er sich schon mal einige Gerechte abkaufen. Der Moment, in dem Ghetto-Chronist Alexander Brandel sein B\u00fcro f\u00fcr den ersten derartige Menschenhandel ist auch sonst so weit bezeichnend f\u00fcr die Prosa dieses Buches, im Guten wie auch sonst: Auch Warsinski, der Konvertit, dessen Hass auf die Juden der Niedertracht und B\u00f6sartigkeit des \u00bbKorps Reinhard\u00ab ebenb\u00fcrtig war, f\u00fcrchtete Brandel. Von einem nerv\u00f6sen, juckenden Ausschlag waren seine Handr\u00fccken tiefrot. Beim Anblick Brandels, als dieser sein B\u00fcro betrat, begann er seine H\u00e4nde mit den Fingern\u00e4geln zu kratzen, so dass sich seine Haut in blutige Schuppen verwandelte.Sp\u00e4ter werden die Gerechten \u00fcber Warsinski herfallen und schadenfroh dabei zusehen wie der sonst f\u00fcr Abtransportquote pr\u00fcgelnde Ordnungsdienst von der SS zu den Z\u00fcgen in Richtung Ofen abtransportiert wird. Genauso wie die Judenr\u00e4te. Im weiteren Verlauf geraten auch die kampfesm\u00fcden Revisionisten beim Versuch sich durch die Kan\u00e4le davon zu stehlen in deutsches Giftgas, Uris l\u00e4sst keinen entkommen, aber erst einmal die nicht ganz so entschlossenen sterben.Nat\u00fcrlich gibt es auch jede Menge Nazi-Kretins wie Bronskis Nachfolger auf dem Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Medizin, den immer korrupter und fetter werdenden Franz K\u00f6nig, den unter Waschzwang leidenden SS-Chef Alfred Funk, den von Epp mit immer neuen Nadelstichen reizt. Dazu werden jede Menge SS-Schergen, die seit Babi Jar und anderen Einsatzkommandos nicht mehr so gut schlafen k\u00f6nnen, im Verlauf des nie da gewesenen heldenhaften Widerstands von Andrej Androfski und seinen Mitstreitern dauerhaft und endg\u00fcltig von ihren Leiden kuriert. Die Underdog-Geschichte mit den anerkanntesten B\u00f6sewichtern der Weltgeschichte und einem breiten Spektrum von Gerechten, eigentlich Guten und jede Menge Schurken auf beiden Seiten, l\u00e4sst dem Leser kaum eine Wahl bei der Identifizierung mit den wahren Helden des Widerstandes, dabei sollte man aber nicht vergessen, dass der alte Kommunistenfresser das literarische Muster des Lieblingsfeinds des kalten Krieges genutzt hat, um einen einigerma\u00dfen funktionierenden Roman zu schreiben. Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich kann man sich von den Schicksalen aus Mila 18 r\u00fchren lassen, aber letztendlich sollte man dar\u00fcber nicht vergessen, dass der zionistische Propagandist Uris ein paar historische Fakten in ein, sagen wir mal, bew\u00e4hrtes literarisches Muster gepresst hat, um sein erstes Buch fertig zu kriegen, das auch den Titel Roman verdient."}, {"userName": "Deborah Pickstone", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37849334-deborah-pickstone", "userReview": "I am left stunned by this story. It is a story; not a lot is known about what actually happened, about who were the participants, during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and here a riveting story has been crafted around the known facts. But even the known facts are astonishing; that a group of essentially unarmed Jews in the Ghetto that had been created by the Nazis took on the German war machine and held out for 42 days - longer than Poland itself.There is surviving testimony as to what took place but it hardly matters - it is the sort of action that was bound to become mythologised. Even, recent research suggests, to the point of the person supposed to have led the Jews in their revolt never having existed. Well, someone led them and very competently too, obviously.I cried.

I probably read it 30 years ago but found my way to it again after visiting Warsaw, Poland and learning a little bit about the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto during WWII. This book is a fictional account of that event. It took me a while to get into this book but once I did, I found myself sobbing over the plight of the Jews with some regularity. As the book tells us, \u201cThe Warsaw Ghetto\u2026once held nearly six hundred thousand people. That number was decimated by starvation, disease, executions, deportation to slave labor, and finally assembly-line murder in Treblinka. [By September 1942] less than fifty thousand remained.\u201d It was at this point that the people in the Ghetto, banded together to fight back. The book does a fine job of describing the factions in the ghetto that prevented an earlier uprising. It did a fine job of showing the mindset it took to fight in the face of certain defeat. And it did a fine job of showing the perseverance and cunning of the Jews who lasted in battle for over a month - from April 13, 1943 through May 16, 1943. This was a miracle unto itself.

Ok. Deep breaths. I'm going to try really, really hard to not get overly worked up here. It's entirely possible, that if you know nothing about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, if you have never read any literary version of the Holocaust (SOPHIE'S CHOICE AHEM COUGH COUGH), and/or if you had forgotten about the many and varied injustices of World War II, this book will present itself as new, exciting, and maybe even revelatory to you. I don't have any personal foothold on these events, but (big disclaimer here) I did live in Poland for a while -- one of those places where things that happened in 1939 are felt to have happened yesterday; where Holocaust survivors routinely visit elementary schools; where the carriage drivers in Old Town can give you their personal narratives of where and how the bombs fell -- so an Amazing Story of Personal Courage in the Face of Adversity - Based on True Events! isn't quite enough to bring me to my feet.So, there's that. But also? This book is propagandist dreck. To be fair, pro-Zionist and anti-Nazi propaganda isn't the worst thing in the world, but -- and this is just my personal preference -- I do not generally favor books where prose, character development, and emotional nuance are manipulated to support a thesis. Mila 18 is half bodice-ripper, half pamphlet, with only the worst qualities of each. I am so unimpressed that the Uprising captured Uris' imagination if the best he could do to was to show it through the eyes of boring, one-dimensional stock characters (\"Angry Zionist\", \"Pacifist Zionist\", \"Wife\") and prose so soul-crushingly awful I was turning down pages JUST SO I COULD TELL GOODREADS ABOUT SOME OF THESE SENTENCES. Witness: \"Rachel and Wolf lay side by side on the bed, awed by the magnificence of their experience...She felt so elated from the wonderment of fulfillment.\"That the preceding combination of words appeared in one of the only popular novels about these absolutely extraordinary true events makes me want to cry.You guys, this is the closest I have ever come to not finishing a book -- the only thing that kept me going was the knowledge that something this conventional would be building to some sort of barnstorming and possibly redemptive climax.

It is the second version I have read of events concerning the Warsaw ghetto during World War II. I also read John Hersey's The Wall as part of my reading list for 1950. Each book takes a slightly different look at this atrocity but it is hard to say which is better. Because he is Leon Uris, he had to put several love stories in his version, but compared to his 1958 bestseller Exodus this book is so much better in terms of writing style and the characters. He makes clear the evil deeds of Hitler and his henchmen when it came to their treatment of Jews, the ways that they fumbled towards the \"final solution,\" the psychopathic inhumanity of all involved, and the methods used to spin the news about what was happening.In contrast, we see the bravery and humanity of the Jewish leaders as they try to keep as many as possible alive in that ghetto. Mila 18 is the name of the building inside the ghetto where the Jewish resistance had their headquarters.Both this book and The Wall make it clear that the journals and diaries of certain people inside the ghetto are responsible for the knowledge we now have about what happened there. Even as the final residents were being obliterated, some took the steps necessary to keep the journals secure and get the information about their locations into safe hands.To me, that is a story worth telling at least twice. As our continuous wars go on, seemingly always presented as a necessary slaughter of people, whether of another religion or another political system, it is sobering to read about how mankind has forever succumbed to such madness. But it is also steadying to read about the victims who resist, who record, and thus live on."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5239887-linda", "userReview": "I recommend this book. The real events were told through fictitious characters. The book opens with the first salvo of WWII when Germany invaded Poland. The 'sub-human' Jews and other undesirables were rounded up like cattle and herded into the ghettos of Warsaw, Poland. What they did to survive slaughter is the meat of this book. Living in the ghetto meant a life of hunger, thirst, fear and a declining will to live. The ghetto dwellers eventually moved underground where even the healing rays of sunlight were lost to them. As their survival instincts flagged, they held to a singular purpose of getting their story out to the world. Several men wrote daily diaries describing the Jew experience in the Warsaw ghettos. The diaries were hidden in several places known to only a few people. One of those few had to survive to retrieve the diaries. One did survive. So we know the story of how the Jews were persecuted and how they fought and held a Goliath army for over a month using mostly crude instruments of war.

Tucked into my book was a newspaper review & a listing of best-selling fiction books, with Mila 18 at #3 just behind works by Irving Stone & John Steinbeck. After finishing the Uris novel I was discomforted to read a comment that the author's main reason for being was that Uris managed to create fiction easily translated into blockbuster films, with Exodus & Battle Cry already among them. When someone in a book club discussion group I am a part of chose the novel, I wondered how the passage of 50 years might alter my interpretation of a book I seemed to take to heart much earlier in life. In rereading Mila 18, I found it to be a seemingly well-researched, well-written work of historical fiction. The novel does not represent a great literary effort but Leon Uris catches my fancy as a better than average story teller, not bad for someone who never graduated from high school because he consistently failed his English class. Lately, there has been no end of so-called \"holocaust novels\" but Mila 18 appeared when this was not the case & interestingly, at a time when Wm. L. Shirer's Rise & Fall of the Third Reich, a very large tome I somehow also managed to read, was listed as the #1 best-seller for non-fiction. It was said at one point that Shirer's book \"read like a murder mystery, which in many ways it was\" but at that point the reality of WWII & the holocaust seemed well beyond my reach, except perhaps when rendered into films. What captured my attention at 2nd reading was that Leon Uris seemed to capture what I now think of as the complexity of sentiments of the various Polish Jews who were rendered rather quickly from citizens of Poland to ghettoized pariahs with no legal status & finally to human beings consigned to charnel houses in Poland & elsewhere by the Nazis, their willing Polish collaborators, as well as others from the Ukraine & elsewhere. The wonder that such atrocious behavior was possible was not easily accepted by me then any more than it is today but this fictional account did introduce me to the concept of the holocaust. Further reading of books by Eli Weisel, Viktor Frankl & others, meeting survivors of Nazi concentration camps + visits to the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. & Yad Vashem in Jerusalem have served as a further resource, while never yielding concrete answers. Perhaps there are none. But beyond that, the question also remains as to whether any fictional account can do justice to the reality of places like Treblinka, Auschwitz, Buchenwald & the many other endpoints of the Final Solution for Jews & others who were thought to be enemies of the Nazis.Mila 18 portrays the desperation of Poles with the Russians on their eastern flank and Nazi Germany to the west, with the Poles not able to defend against either. Ultimately, Germany invades by air & overland quickly pulverizing any Polish resistance, including that manifested by 30,000 Jews who served in the Polish army. The novel details the inner struggle of the Polish Jews who occupy the Warsaw Ghetto & demonstrate a wide variety of views on their plight, including some who feel that resistance is most un-Jewish, hoping that their fate will ultimately improve. A rabbi intones, \"Our best defense is to be good Jews\". As news of death-camps filters into the ghetto, those who have not already been sent off to what they initially believed to be less ominous relocations for labor required by the Nazi war effort, those remaining cluster together & begin a concerted resistance, sensing the ultimate futility of such a path but also realizing there are no other alternatives. As one explains: All were imprisoned within the ghetto in a loosely knit association of diversified ideologies & each beats his breast & berates the other. I don't care if your beliefs take you along a path of Orthodox religion or Zionist ideology or a path of labor activism. We are all here because our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest, seemingly devoid of human dignity. Beyond the forest, all of our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren hills of Judea. This is our singular goal. How we travel through the forest is for each man's conscience. Where we end our journey is always the same. We all seek the same thing through different ways--an end to the long night of 2,000 years of darkness & unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the star of David flies over Zion.All of Warsaw has become a coffin for the ghettoized Jews. While I am not interested in singling out the main characters of the Uris novel, the author details competing alliances, some generational divisions & also several love stories, perhaps to retain the interest of those readers with a less historical bent. With limited resources & few weapons, the remaining Jews exact a rather heavy toll on the German soldiers who are quite unprepared for Jewish resistance of any kind. When the insurrection begins, many within the ghetto are glad to be Jews for the 1st time in their lives. The various bunkers that are linked together in the ghetto are named after concentration camps and there is a memorable celebration of Passover as their reinforced enemy gathers outside for the final assault. As word of the prolonged resistance within Warsaw's Jewish ghetto seeps out to the rest of Europe, the \"dubious battle\" (a phrase Uris uses several times) becomes a source of pride & even inspiration. There are indeed formulaic elements to Mila 18 but Leon Uris manages to give dimension to the many characters, some of whom do manage to escape & survive via a tunnel, even as the ghetto is torched & obliterated at novel's end. And the story of the insurrection has sufficient complexity to hold one's interest, even at a 2nd reading of the novel, one that I think serves as a vehicle for understanding at least one chapter of WWII & the Holocaust."}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7620837-frank", "userReview": "Very powerful novel about the Warsaw Ghetto and the Jewish Uprising there during WWII. I've read quite a bit about the Holocaust but this is the first novel I've read about the Warsaw Ghetto and the courageous fighters who faced the Nazis with limited weapons including homemade bombs and their bare hands. This novel by Uris was sweeping in scope telling the story of Poland and Warsaw before the German invasion in 1939 and through the horrors of the ghetto. The novel focuses on a group of people including Jews, Polish non-Jews, and Germans. The Jewish characters and the Poles who helped them were very believable and Uris\u2019 descriptions made me feel their pain as they fought their oppressors. The German characters were sufficiently evil and there was no question that I despised them and everything they stood for. Every time I read something about the Holocaust, I can't believe how man can be so inhuman towards man!This novel was written in 1961 and some of the first part of the novel was a little soap-operaish, in line with other novels of the time like Harold Robbins and Irving Wallace. But overall, I would definitely recommend this one. I have read QBVII by Uris which I would also recommend and I most definitely will be reading more of his work."}, {"userName": "Nitya", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/809060-nitya", "userReview": "Imagine being an Olympic soccer player, an officer in the Polish Army, and a loyal Pole who happens to be a Jew. The main character in this book,(which is based on the real life events of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in the spring of 1942) is all of those. Andrei Androfski bravely leads his troops against the Germans while still an officer in the Polish Army. Once defeated by Germany however, he is made to live in the Warsaw ghetto along with hundreds of thousands of Jews from Poland and other parts of Europe. Andrei wants nothing more than to fight back against the Nazis.Unfortunately he has no weapons and no soldiers. As circumstances for the Jews grow more dire, with hundreds starving every day, and with word of the death camps beginning to be believed, Andrei gathers a small group of fighters, men and women both. Living in underground bunkers in the ghetto, all the Jews simply refused to show up for deportation in the early months of 1942. This infuriated the Nazis, who had built their camps in Poland expressly for mass liquidation (execution) of the Jewish population. Against all odds, knowing they could not possibly win in the long run, these thousands of Jews rebelled. Some by hiding, some by fighting. They are all heroes. I am fascinated by how we as humans react to extreme circumstances, how our spirits find strength to live in the midst of tragedy, death, and destruction. This is what drew me to this book. The author uses historical facts and spins a story, well, actually several stories while doing so. I loved being inspired by the stories of courage and sacrifice. It was hard not to give this book more stars, but Leon Uris' style of writing got in the way of the story. Overall, the story carried the book, and the writing detracted from it."}, {"userName": "Matthew Laing", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39690288-matthew-laing", "userReview": "Uris is a compelling author and has a knack for the historical fiction page-turner. Mila 18 is excellent at capturing the world of the Warsaw Ghetto and really paces the novel well so that you, through the eyes of several characters, see its inexorable decline towards death and destruction. Uris puts a lot of emphasis on the complexities of Jewish society in this period - rather than portraying them all as heroic victims in unified suffering, he goes into the complex intra-social divisions amongst Jews, the tragedy of Jews working against each other in this period, and various ways in which Jewish people tried to ensure their cultural survival. But Mila 18 shares with Uris' other novels some weak characterization and poor writing. Uris really struggles with authentic interactions between characters, especially romantic interactions, and some romantic conversations were so overwrought and cliche I just skipped over them. His characters are very diverse in terms of portrayal, some are nuanced and complex, others feel readily stereotyped and one dimensional. Also there are some departures from the historical record that seem unnecessary. The clearest example of this is the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which is the climax of the novel but is somewhat revisionist in depicting a month of glorious victories for the Jewish fighters and rank cowardice and incompetence on the part of the Germans. Also some of the historical account of the book shows its age - Uris repeats several urban myths about the war that have long since been debunked. Overall, it's an enjoyable book that gets you into that period and helps you feel the horror and inhumanity of the Warsaw Ghetto, but there's bit a too much Hollywood and stereotyping for my taste."}, {"userName": "Gerald", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7250653-gerald", "userReview": "My wife and I went to Poland on an Eastern European tour in 2005.

I read the book as soon as we returned from our trip. This historical fiction book is the absolutely incredible story of how the Germans built a walled concentration camp within the city of Warsaw and forced a huge number of Jews inside the area which originally housed a much smaller number of Warsaw citizens. It became known as The Warsaw Ghetto. The Jews organized themselves, built tunnels and homemade weapons, and finally revolted against the horrors of their Nazi captors. By heroic means they held off their captors for 43 days while completely surrounded.

Leon painstakingly researched the Warsaw Ghetto and the Uprising and the facts are historically correct. However, he used his imagination as a fiction writer to create the characters and their conversations and movements. Some of the characters are real and were actually in the Ghetto and did what he says they did. Rosenblum, for instance, did write a journal about what was going on in the Ghetto and he did bury writings, diaries, histories, etc. in milk cans and other canisters at various spots in Warsaw. Some were actually retrieved; but some are still lost. This is not a book to be read in one sitting or even two. It is a book to be savored and thought about as you are reading. Although not necessary, knowing something of the history of the Warsaw ghetto, the Uprising, and the Nazis, it does help to understand the actions of the characters better. In addition to being a story about the ghetto and the uprising, an attempt to understand how different people react to the same circumstances. He shows how and tells why some Jews became collaborators and \u201cbetrayed\u201d their own, sometimes even their own families. As it begins before WWII, you see how those who considered themselves not to be Jews were drawn into helping the Nazis. It explains how the Jewish ruling group in the Ghetto came about and how each member dealt with what he had to do. His book also shows how women were controlled by their husbands and fathers prior to WWII and how that changed as the war continues. Some were forced by circumstances to break out of the mold and become independent young women. Rachael, for example, defied her father by living with Wolf. He refused to allow the marriage by himself and made sure the other Jews knew he did not condone marriage thus leaving them to live together in \u201csin\u201d. What is interesting is that Rachael does have the consent of her mother to do this. Deborah was in an arranged marriage and found herself basically a slave to her husband. She met Christopher de Monti before the war and had an affair with him. When given a chance to leave the Ghetto with Christopher, she refused and stayed with her children in the Ghetto. Christopher, an Italian by passport, refused to leave since he couldn\u2019t leave Deborah even though he doesn\u2019t see her anymore. Leon Uris delves into changes in social standards as he writes. The book is very good and very well written. It is another book that brings history to life."}, {"userName": "J.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19030903-j", "userReview": "Mila 18 is largely based on historically accurate accounts. There are a few 'facts' included that don't hold up, such as the making soap from humans rumor, which was apparently experimented with, but never employed on a large-scale basis. Mila 18, however, gives an all-too-accurate picture of the horrible role played by the Jewish Police in rounding up people for the Holocaust. One source\u00b9 states a chilling allegation: \"Every Jewish child was taught, and this saved the lives of some of them, 'if you enter a square from which there are three exits, one guarded by a German SS man, one by a Ukrainian and one by a Jewish policeman, then you should first try to pass the German, and then maybe the Ukrainian, but never the Jew.'\" If there is any major omission in Mila 18, it's in understating Polish efforts to help Jews and support the ghetto uprising. (ibid).Mila 18 is, of course, a novel, so historical accuracy is not vital to the story, which is well-told and populated with fascinating characters, many of whom were based on real people. It's a disturbing book, but should be read for two reasons: (1) To ensure such things never happen again; (2) To prepare ourselves for when they inevitably do.
