I must be really caught up in this now; these are like my own people. Some of them I want to sit down to tea with and have a nice heart-to-heart. Others I want to shake until a spot of sense returns. Some of these characters seem like little children that have been led astray- I may be angry with them but deep down I still care. It\u2019s hard to say too much without giving anything away \u2013 I don\u2019t want to ruin this for any readers that are considering the series. I\u2019ll speak pretty generally, minus any spoilers plot-wise.Ross continues to struggle with his mine and undergoes an inner turmoil that will test him and those close to him. He sinks further psychologically. \"For the first time in his life he began to feel old. Often these last years he had known himself a failure, but always within him there had been a fundamental conviction that this was a temporary phase, a \u2018down\u2019 which in the nature of events must be followed by an \u2018up\u2019. At least a part of this conviction had derived from a knowledge of his own youth and vigor.\"Caroline Penvenen is a favorite of mine. I applaud Winston Graham for writing such a complex character \u2013 there is certainly much more to her than meets the eye. Her wit and her generosity shine through; one can\u2019t help but be charmed by her.George Warleggan is featured even more extensively in this installment. His power seems to have no boundaries. Yet there is some deep-seated inferiority complex that seems to drive many of his actions. He wants to be seen and heard, whether good or bad. \"George did not spend his time in company which cared nothing for his approval or disapproval.\"In a curious turn of events, we see Ross playing the role of matchmaker. Of course, his wisdom in these matters is really thanks to Demelza, who is an expert in matters of the heart \u2013 at least the hearts of others. \"She\u2019d say life holds only two or three things worth the having, and if you possess them the rest don\u2019t matter, and if you do not possess them the rest are useless.\" Yes, Demelza, let\u2019s do sit down one of these days! I think we\u2019d get along splendidly.I clutched the edge of my seat after finishing the last page and yelled to the hubby to queue up the next three episodes on our DVR. Oddly enough, he is nearly as smitten with the television series as I am with the books. Each time I have opened a paperback in the past couple of weeks, I have had to dash his hopes. He eagerly awaits my completion of Book 5, The Black Moon, so that we can begin Season 3 which began airing this month. I love pairing the books with the series, a little at a time. As I finish one book, I watch 3 or 4 episodes and it all feels so real to me! The book captures more of the emotion than even the show can do; but I like to have the faces in my head while I read, as well as the stunning scenery. \"We can none of us separate ourselves from the consequences of our own behavior.\""}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6972914-karen", "userReview": "5 STARSOMFG!

Now that she is free the smitten George W. wants her to become his bride. But Elizabeth seems to want Ross and doesn't care what effect this might have on Ross's wife and child. When Ross learns that Elizabeth is to marry Warleggan he loses control and immediately confronts her. Needless to say, when Ross doesn't return that night Demelza realizes that Ross still loves Elizabeth after all these years.Ross's betrayal of Demelza was heartbreaking for me to read leading me to despise Elizabeth more than ever. But once Ross has partaken of forbidden fruit he surprisingly realizes he no longer desires her and never returns to see her after that incident, leaving her with no other option than to marry George Warleggan. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned though and Elizabeth is not taking her rejection well although I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Elizabeth brought down a peg or two.Demelza emerges triumphant leaving her rival in the dust. Unfortunately Elizabeth is now pregnant with what is probably Ross's child. Mr. George Warleggan will be extremely disturbed to learn he has a cuckoo in his nest if this new arrival unnaturally resembles Ross. There couldn't be a better way for Ross to achieve revenge either.FINALLY Wheal Grace's riches are discovered and the Poldarks are on their well deserved way to the top now.

The whole Poldark series is a literary set of gems but this is a standout piece of writing. I cried reading parts of this book, something very rare for me. Warleggan has to be one of the most heart wrenching books I have read, it is a beautifully written study of a marriage in crisis - this book shows how cruel people can unwittingly be to those who love them. Winston Graham shows the betrayal,the anger, the disgust - heightened emotions of self doubt, revenge, pride and forgiveness. The people in Poldark country live, they are not cliched cutouts but fully formed people whose every character fault is plumbed (or mined)to perfection. I am in awe that this male author has that very rare skill of writing his female characters as believably as his male.

Menudos cabreos me he pillado con \u00e9l. Pero justamente eso es lo que m\u00e1s he disfrutado. Warleggan es un libro de esos que no te deja indiferente, que te hace querer \"tirar personajes por los acantilados\" (eh Gema? xDDD), te hace echar humo por las orejas y que la bilis se te salga por la boca. No exagero. He de decir que para leer este libro hay que tener muy, muy claro, pero muy muy mucho, el contexto hist\u00f3rico en que transcurre y tambi\u00e9n el a\u00f1o en que fue escrito. Si lo mismo que he le\u00eddo en este libro estuviera ambientado en la actualidad, habr\u00eda quemado el libro al acabarlo. Ross es un personaje que me ha hecho sentir un odio supremo. S\u00ed, Ross, el PROTAGONISTA. Se supone que a una le gusta adorar a sus h\u00e9roes de novela, no odiarlos pero Ross es tan complejo, tiene una personalidad tan carism\u00e1tica y a la vez tan impenetrable que una no sabe qu\u00e9 hacer con \u00e9l. Tambi\u00e9n he de decir que me encanta encontrarme este tipo de personajes y este tipo de historia que me plantean un reto tan grande. Para m\u00ed esta historia ha supuesto un reto enorme y s\u00f3lo he podido superarlo poniendo la historia en el contexto que le toca.

It takes all the impetus of motion created in the first three volumes and pushes it headlong down the track at a screaming pace. Fortunes change on a whim and evil prospers and ebbs and prospers again. I spent much of this volume holding my breath.After losing Francis, the triangle of Ross, Elizabeth and Demelza reaches a fever pitch and Ross finds himself caught between his inability to give up his old, unfulfilled affections and his now too comfortable life with his wife. The results are a flurry of emotions that serve none of these characters well. I could not help casting back to poor Keren Daniels and thinking that what others deemed in a female a felonious crime is but a misdemeanor for the male population.Meanwhile, the romance between Dwight and Caroline progresses as well, with a lovely edge that is both witty and romantic. I must confess to loving this couple and cringing at the idea that they will not have their own happy ending...but happiness can be an elusive thing in this 1790s world of Cornwall.As the name suggests, we begin to see George come into his own and the Warleggans figure very prominent in Ross\u2019 destiny. Up to this point, Ross has had the hatred of Cary, but George has been less vitriolic. No more. Now George\u2019s real colors begin to show and the kind of hatred he spews is extreme and dangerous. By the end of this volume, the field is beginning to be evened by Ross\u2019 success at Wheal Grace, and it leaves me in anticipation of how the fight may change now that Ross has some resources with which to counter-punch.By this point in the story, I am totally committed to these characters and their fate. They are drawn with such detail that they have nuanced personalities and temperaments, and Graham happily keeps them to the standards that he set for them in the beginning. I find every action and word to be in keeping with what we already have been told about these people, and that is essential to my enjoyment of the story."}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1451470-michele", "userReview": "This has been the best one so far for me.

Ross and his cousin Francis are trying to keep afloat a mine that they have maintained for some time. But Ross is hard put to get the necessary additional financing and finds himself falling deeper in debt. George Warleggan firmly establishes himself in Cornish society and as an economic powerholder in Cornwall. The growing power and influence of Warleggan throughout the novel is highlighted, as are the lives of Ross & Demelza, Francis & Elizabeth Poldark, Dr. Dwight Enys (a close and trusted friend of Ross, whose radical approach to practicing medicine has made him both loved and scorned throughout the district), and Caroline Penwenen. Ross and Demelza, in particular, experience some struggles that put their marriage to the test. There are also some surprising, relationships which take root among some of the other main characters, which are described in rich and colorful detail.

I just can't believe what a jerk you were in this book.Of course, not nearly as much of a jerk as the title character(s), especially George. Talk about a twisted man. He pursues and marries his rival's first love (and still inamorata, dammit) before her husband is cold in the grave. He then proceeds to abandon a fabulous new mansion to go live in the Poldark homestead, Trenwith, right next door to Ross, in order to twist the knife still further. Then he bans everyone from walking on the land, humiliating Demelza and shooting the Poldarks' dog. THEN, he twists a totally unselfish (though STUPID) act by Ross (selling shares of his \"worthless\" mine and giving the proceeds, a princely 600 pounds, to Elizabeth so she won't be destitute) into cheating his ward and suing Ross to undo the deed, since the mine is now making money. Jeez, what a CS.But Ross can't help but throw away happiness with both hands. A \"forced\" liaison with Elizabeth, which Demelza instantly tumbles to, results in damn near a year of very cold feelings, and in Demelza almost throwing herself on the adultery train with a military man. I object to the fact that things seem to improve for the Poldarks only when the finances improve. I think that's a disservice to both Ross and Demelza, who points out that she's been dirt poor and OK with it, and could do so again.Ouch, ouch, ouch. Yes, I'm still thoroughly hooked and can't wait to tear into the next book later tonight. But Winston, WHY? Why have a thoroughly honest and rational man, act like such an asshole? The plot thickens? Yes, I suppose so, but I will be much, much more cautious about my feelings for Ross, which up until this book have been completely positive.Looking forward to seeing what happens with Caroline, yet another character I can't figure out.
