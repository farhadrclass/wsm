You should honestly read this review anyway, because I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone anyways.I'm finally that person writing a negative review in contrast to all the many positive, glowing reviews. When I first read the description of this book and entered the giveaway, I was SO excited. I even told a bunch of my friends about it, and created a waiting list of people who wanted it after I was done. Go ahead. Read the description and tell me that doesn't sound awesome. I know you want to read it.I got this book and began it as soon as I had a little bit of time on my hands. I was pulled in immediately. But, even at the beginning, there were hints that this experience was about to be turned sour. This book is about a pregnant woman who hires a nanny to help her with her existing children and the child she is about to have. Her husband is in the Navy, and is always gone, which supposedly adds and element of creepiness. We witness this story through the minds of the female detective taking care of the case, the pregnant mother, and the nanny. From the beginning, we get to read the thoughts and actions of the suspicious nanny. The nanny is constantly having suspicious thoughts, where she gets sentimental and talks about how she is going to ruin the lives of the family she is working for. This tirade of thoughts is so constant, its annoying. It felt as if the author believed that I was mentally impaired, and needed to shove this information down my throat until I was choking on it. SERIOUSLY, I GET IT, THE NANNY IS HAVING SUSPICIOUS THOUGHTS. Why didn't you just freaking include a description of a red arrow floating above her head? For the rest of this review, I'm just going to put character's names and then record all the problems and inconsistencies in their behavior.Nanny (Zoe/Heather): As I said before, the nanny won't stop thinking these red herring thoughts that will annoy the crap out of you. This continues until \"the twist\" is revealed. The author tries to tell you through the nanny's thoughts that this woman REALLY wants a baby to please her crazy significant other, and this is reflected in the nanny's constant thoughts about securing a baby. But, as we reach the end, we learn that she doesn't actually want a baby, and that she isn't trying at all. Wait, so then why was she having thoughts about wanting a baby so bad? Why is she using a pregnancy test if she hasn't had sex with anyone? Why did she break it in half if she doesn't actually give a shit? The author focuses less on the bigger picture of how these pieces fit together, and again, questions your intelligence by failing to match up behaviors and thoughts from the beginning of the book with the real characters revealed at the end. It's absolutely lazy, and it completely took me out of the story. Later on, we have two more huge inconsistencies. The nanny, (who is later revealed to be an undercover agent), breaks into the husband's study to search for files. The pregnant mother is a social worker, and has the files for a woman who was killed by a murderer trying to cut out her baby. As the reader, we've had it rammed into our minds that the nanny is this murderer. Anyways, the nanny breaks into the husband's office, and proceeds to take pictures of the murdered woman's file. This makes sense with what we know at the time. At the end of the book, when the nanny is rumored to be an undercover agent, we learn that the husband was actually part of some money laundering operation (totally random plot point that comes out of nowhere that the author seemed to throw in because she had no idea what she doing). So wait, why was the nanny taking pictures of the murdered woman's file? That's completely irrelevant to her supposed purpose in the house. Yet again, the author forgot to match up the past self with the real self. That's just lazy writing. Last inconsistency. The police are trying to solve the pregnant women murders, and they are led to the nanny. They interview the nanny multiple times, and each time she turns bright red, acts incredibly nervous, and seems uncomfortable. This makes sense at the time with what the reader knows, which is that the nanny is totally the murderer. It doesn't make sense when we later learn that the nanny is an undercover agent. She's been UNDERCOVER for weeks, and suddenly she's incapable of lying in this situation? Lazy, stupid writing. Either she's a frighteningly incompetent secret agent, or the author just didn't feel like making this story plausible. What's weird is that the female detective acts really, really, weird about the interviews. She talks about how the nanny seemed to be totally in control of the interview. They were literally 3-4 descriptions in a row of this nanny acting nervous and turning bright raspberry multiple times, in a row. Why the hell does this female detective find this so coy? This isn't even a lack of connection between past self and real self, it just doesn't make any sense at all. Pregnant Woman (Ends up being the murderer and is faking her pregnancy): Come on readers. I read so many reviews for this book, and they all talked about the \"amazing twist\" at the end. I have no idea what constitutes a twist for you, but this definitely isn't it. There are no hints at this coming, and it doesn't match this woman's behavior throughout the book at all. And the twist has no complexity or building up either. All of a sudden, the killer is revealed. This is just dumb.The worst thing that bothered me (not an inconsistency, just something really ridiculous), was that the pregnant woman discovers that her nanny BROKE INTO HER HUSBAND'S OFFICE AND TOOK PICTURES OF PRIVATE GOVERNMENT FILES. She proceeds to NOT FIRE THE NANNY, and instead agonizes about hurting her nanny's feelings. I want to emphasize how ridiculous this is, but unlike the author, I do not believe you lack intelligence. The Detectives: Another problem with the author: Artificial extension of the plot. The author belabored and artificially filled the story by making these detectives act like bumbling fools. At one point, the female detective failed to follow up on a lead, and the male detective literally asked her why she didn't. The author prolonged things by making her characters act like idiots, AND THEN LITERALLY HAD THE OTHER DETECTIVE POINT OUT THAT THEY WERE ACTING DUMB. There's the other point that I already brought up in which they interview the nanny. At this point, the nanny is looking pretty suspicious. They interview her, and during this interview she blushes, acts nervous, and basically has \"I'm guilty\" printed on her forehead. The female detective even points out that the nanny is a horrendous liar. They leave the interview and seem incredibly suspicious, but they fail to tail her, investigate her, and report this horribly suspicious incident to anyone. Come on guys. The worst part of the detective's story is their daughter. The author wanted to extend her already lengthy, horrible novel by adding a side plot that is stupid, frustrating, and completely irrelevant to the main plot. The female detective and the male detective are married, and have two daughters. The female detective comes home to her daughter telling her she's moving out and getting married at 17. I don't know how realistically the author handled this situation, because I've never been involved in anything like this, but it seemed contrived. The daughter gives her mother a nasty attitude about the whole situation and acts like a horribly spoiled brat, while the mother and father fail to take any constructive action at all. As annoying as this sideplot was, it was also totally unnecessary. I didn't care about the detective's daughter before, during, or after the conflict... she wasn't relevant to the story. Why would the author add this? In a technical aspect, this book wasn't horrible. As frequently as I bashed the author, her writing style was not horrible, it just wasn't anything special. The writing itself exists simply to hurry the plot along without embellishment. As much as this book was supposed to be a thriller, it didn't convey a lot of tension. The gaping plot holes always prevented me from being immersed in the story, and the constant red herrings and obvious actions of the nanny didn't help either. As much as everything fell apart, the author did one thing correctly. The last sentence is phenomenal and incredibly creepy, although when I think about it, it didn't really make sense... unless all the cops were really as stupid as they seemed to be. Save yourself the trouble and don't read this book."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "This is an absolutely stunning read. It is a psychological thriller told from three different points of view, that of Claudia, her nanny Zoe and Lorraine, a detective. Claudia and Zoe's stories are told in the first person, and because each character has a very distinct, individual voice, it works from the very first chapters. It seems to add to the chilling feel of the book as right from the start you are completely immersed inside the minds of two of the main characters, living the story with them.It is a book that simply drip feeds menace to the reader, with every single chapter seeming to seep out a little bit more so that by the end of the read you are completely wiped out. It is impossible to talk about the storyline itself without giving anything away, suffice to say that it is one where, as a woman, I could empathise, in different ways, with all three of the main characters.It is a very cleverly plotted book, one which will have you constantly trying to work things out in your head as you read on. The characters are very easy to connect and empathise with. When you have finished it, you will still be going over it in your mind the next day thinking \"Could it have happened that way?\" I found myself googling one particular thing just to check its feasibility and the answer was \"yes\".It was a book that had me gripped from the prologue and left me open mouthed at the end. I think it is one of the best books I have read in a long while and can't recommend it highly enough."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "[Zoe was working undercover (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Cora \u2615 Tea Party Princess", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4166936-cora-tea-party-princess", "userReview": "This was amazing!

Actress Rebecca De Mornay plays the 'nanny'.\"Zoe Harper\", nanny extraordinaire, in \"Until You're Mine\", and Rebecca De Mornay have a few character traits in common. ***Creepy qualities*** Its a family affair-(haha), with Zoe watching the young twin boys of James and Claudia. Claudia has another child due soon. Zoe is hired to help. James leaves home for work for long stretches. He's a Navy Officer.While the family drama is happening --an investigation is in full swing for a horrific murder. Lorraine and Adam -(a married couple with two daughters -with problems of their own) --are in charge of the investigation. While the reader is trying to figure out who the killer is... Keep in mind, THIS is a FUN-THRILLER-RIDE. Its FICTION!!! If you go into your 'head' and try to pick-it-apart as to what feels 'realistic' or 'not', you'll spoil your own enjoyment!I'm pretty good at guessing \"WHO THE BAD GUY IS\",I guessed correct in 'Gone Girl' during the first 10 pages, but not with this novel! Not even close!!! The twist is a great part of this story! WOW-WONDERFUL!! As in 'got-ya'! The 'ride' doesn't disappoint, at all!!! The ending is a RUSH! This is one of those books where LESS information is best! READ the Blurp, (it tells all you need to know)....Its page turning 'Addicting'! Leave your critical thinking about realism in the closet.

She is a new author to me and I'm eager to read more of her books.Claudia is 8 1/2 months pregnant. She's married to James, who is in the Navy and step-mom to James' twin 4-year-old sons. She is working as a social worker and as her husband will be on a submarine somewhere when she delivers, she is looking for a nanny to help out.Lorraine is an officer of the law. Her newest case involves the murder of a pregnant woman and her baby. The woman was cut open, resembling a Cesarean Section. Having children of her own, and having problems with her husband, isn't helping with her efforts to concentrate on the case.Zoe applies for the position of nanny. Zoe has secrets, lots of secrets.The chapters alternate between the three woman. Extremely well written. Lots of roller coaster twists and turns. The final twist is a real eye-opener.

This was a cleverly plotted, unpredictable read that kept me entertained and totally captivated the whole time.This is told from three perspectives, Claudia, Zoe and Lorraine.

But James was also a submariner in the Navy where he spent months at a time at sea. So it seemed like a sensible idea for them to hire a nanny to help Claudia with the boys, and their new baby girl when she arrived.

This book was really easy to read. There are three main characters each of which get a chapter of their own and then it switches back to the first and so on.

The PlotClaudia Morgan-Brown is pregnant, very pregnant and she needs a nanny to help with her 4 year old twin step-sons and soon to arrive new baby girl. In comes Zoe, a nanny from heaven it would seem, but the girl has secrets. The third main character who it appears will star in future novels in DI Lorraine Fisher. DI Fisher comes on the scene when there is a violent attack on a young pregnant girl leaving her and her baby both deceased. DI Fisher is having a slew of problems in her personal life and now that I noticed that she will be the star of the series I understand why such time was taken describing her life and character. Who is harming these poor pregnant girls? Is Claudia or her baby in danger? What does Zoe really want with the Morgan-Brown Clan?This book unveils secrets upon secrets and I had a really fun time trying to figure it out. Admittedly I guessed it right but that wasn't until I read more than 75% of the book and it didn't detract at all from the reveal because I had lingering doubts the whole time. The way the three characters stories and secrets weave together at the end is stunning.

And it wasn't quite good enough to warrant me falling asleep at work and requiring multiple teas (because unfortunately, the appeal of coffee escapes me). I'm giving Until You're Mine 3 stars because although I don't have many complaints, my inner book snob (sorry!) can't justify 4+ for this type of book. It is exactly the prose you'd expect from a slightly silly and unrealistic popcorn thriller.But the plot! And, especially, the ending! They made my skin crawl a little, and kept me turning and turning the pages (well, clicking and clicking the next page button). And really threw me for a loop - I guessed only the most obvious of the many twists the author managed to work in.

Although not a mother myself, it struck me that a story about a pregnant woman with creepy nanny could be one of those edge-of-my-seat kind of books because the stakes are so very high. Until You're Mine is told through three perspectives - Claudia who is finally pregnant with her first child after years of trying and heartbreak, Zoe the nanny who seems too good to be true and Lorraine, the police office investigating a rash of deaths amongst pregnant women in the local area. Lorraine's perspective was a real surprise, for although she is the investigating officer, she is also having problems in her marriage to Adam, who is also a cop working the same cases as Lorraine.Unfortunately, Lorraine's perspective, although interesting, actually distracted me from the storyline of Zoe and Claudia and I didn't really see why it was relevant to the story. It almost felt like it was thrown in as a filler to make the story longer (and at 400 pages it's not exactly a quick read) and it also made it difficult for me to connect with Lorraine because I just wasn't invested in her story.As for the plot between Claudia and Zoe, that was certainly more what I was looking for - there was definitely an element of mystery and as the story progressed it became more and more captivating as more about Claudia and Zoe's pasts were revealed and the story climaxed in a way I wasn't really expecting. I didn't see the clues that led up to the ending, although looking back they were there but just cleverly concealed.Until You're Mine is a good, if slightly predictable in places, thriller, with a lot of mystery and some very clever characterisation.

My 2.5 yr old son fell out of bed around 2:30am this morning. I couldn't go back to sleep right, so I decided to listen to this audiobook for a bit. It's now 5:30am and I'm finished AND WIDE AWAKE!! What a story!!!! Thank you Lisa E for recommending it. I just hope I can sneak in a nap later today!!Review:My heart aches for couples that struggle to conceive. I can only imagine the pain they feel when they are disappointed month after month. The emotional and financial strains infertility places on a family are often devastating. How far would you go to have a baby? In this story, one woman is so consumed by having a child that she will do the unthinkable.This story is gripping.

Dit boek stond al eeuwen op mijn to read list en toen ik deze prachtige cover voorbij zag komen op de Deventer boekenmarkt nam ik hem gelijk mee. Op Goodreads kun je het niet zien, maar de cover is zilver en shiny! Super mooi!Gelukkig is niet enkel de buitenkant mooi, ook de binnenkant is goed, erg goed zelfs!In dit boek volgen we Claudia. Claudia is hoogzwanger, haar man is een marinier en vaak lang weg en tevens is ze stiefmoeder van een tweeling. Leuk, maar ook pittig, daarom is ze op zoek naar een Nanny. Na een advertentie stuit ze op Zo\u00eb. Zo\u00eb heeft goede referenties en de klik is er, maar toch blijft Claudia een vreemd gevoel bij haar houden. En die onrust wordt alleen maar gevoed..Het boek leest super vlot. Tijdens het lezen van dit boek las ik zomaar 100 pagina\u2019s per uur! Interessant en ik voelde continue een lichte spanning.Halverwege het boek had ik het helemaal uitgedokterd, dacht ik.. en toen kwam de ontknoping, wauw! Dit had ik totaal niet zien aankomen en ik heb dus ook even teruggebladerd om te zien waar ik het gemist had.

If you are pregnant buy it for when you are cradling your baby in your arms during those sleepless nights ahead.This is a book starts with the description of a young girl sprinkling her tiny-tears doll with \u2018magic dust\u2019 to bring her to life, when the girl has no live baby in her arms by the time she is twelve, she throws her doll onto the fire in disgust.This book is dominated by mothers; mothers-to-be and women who long-to-be-mothers, step-mothers and mothers of teenagers. Underlying each page is the feeling that there are untold truths and half-told lies. The quest for the truth left me with a sense of unease, a longing to know what was going on while fearing what the next page would reveal. In short a great psychological thriller that made my heart race, gasp out loud shortly followed by a sharp intake of breath. Samantha Hayes has an eye for detail in her descriptions particularly Claudia\u2019s home with the worn stair carpet and locked study door. Zoe\u2019s interactions with Claudia and her best friend Pip have an authentic feel, with the truths and lies exchanged with reddening faces and quivering limbs. This is a fast moving story which had me in it\u2019s grip from the first page to the very last revelation.For more please check out http://cleopatralovesbooks.wordpress....I received this book from the publisher in return for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Myrna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8789819-myrna", "userReview": "I see the Goodreads community is divided on their ratings/feelings of this book.

I was provided a copy of this by the publisher and Blogging for Books in exchange for an honest review. I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers because of the unusual twist and turns and and how tense the atmosphere is. This one had me on edge even more than usual due to the emotional subject matter. Someone is trying to steal babies...before they are actually born- removing them from the womb of the mother, often taking the life of both. So, when the reader meets a young woman with twin step-sons and a baby girl on the way, who is advertising for a nanny.. well, you see where this is going. For some reason I was just as drawn in by the secondary story involving the investigators on the case- a married couple- Lorraine and Adam. While at work the two never let on they are married, but the reader knows that something is not right in the relationship. It's not rocket science, but the rift between them has repercussions when their teenage daughter begins to act out. It is very difficult to write reviews on a book that is so loaded with spoiler landmines. No one situation, no one relationship, is as it originally appeared to be. I will confess that as reader of many thrillers I had begun to piece a few things together but some of the inner thoughts of the characters kept me guessing and doubting my conclusions.The author did a great job of planting well placed red herrings and leading us to conclude one thing while something altogether different was going on. Even if you do think you have some things figured out, there are some big reveals you will probably never see coming. The plot is very carefully and cleverly woven and for the most part it works. A few too many characters which combined with some truly puzzling conversations at times got a little too complicated making it hard for me to remain focused. I had to go back and re-read passages to be sure I had the characters names and positions correct. In the end the conclusion is as chilling as I thought it would be.  It appears this book is the first novel in a planned series featuring Lorraine. I enjoyed this one enough to give the second book a try.

She has a career as a social-services supervisor, a loving spouse, twin stepsons, and the little girl she has always dreamed of is due in just a few weeks. With so much on her plate, it is now time to hire a nanny who can get used to the run of the house before the new baby arrives. At first Zoe seems perfect, yet Claudia can\u2019t escape the nagging feeling that something is lurking just beneath the surface. Those uneasy feelings soon get combined with the fact that local pregnant women have been brutally attacked, and Claudia is left trying to decide whether she truly has a reason to be afraid or if it\u2019s just her own paranoia. Told from rotating perspectives of three female leads \u2013 Claudia, Zoe and Lorraine (the police detective assigned to the pregnant women cases), \u201cUntil You\u2019re Mine\u201d will leave you guessing until the end. As my first ARC, I was TERRIFIED to begin reading this novel. After all, what if it absolutely stunk and I had to give it a bad rating? (Note: I am not a person who would be capable of passing off utter garbage to others in hopes of continuing to receive free books, so I was shaking in my boots that my first reviewer copy would be my last.) I chose \u201cUntil You\u2019re Mine\u201d because my gut told me it would be good. My gut didn\u2019t lie. Not only was the mystery/thriller part of this book something that grabbed my attention right away, the underlying personal stories of the three main women really thickened the plot. Instead of just actionactionactionaction that left me reeling and wishing the book would hurry up and end, Hayes takes you into the private lives and behind the scenes drama that does not involve the \u201cwhodunit\u201d part of the book whatsoever. It was a nice change of pace and I was so pleasantly surprised to find some twists and turns added to the mix as well.
