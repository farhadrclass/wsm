Loved the protagonist Wyatt, the Nova Scotia setting at the start of WWII, the ugliness of prejuduce (against Germans) depicted, the U-boat attacks, the small town feeling similar to what you find in a Richard Russo novel-- everything. Bronson Pinchot narrated and he was just perfect. He is really very talented with his accents and characterizations.I was all set to give this 5 stars but the last couple of chapters sort of fell flat for me. Even the narrator seemed less enthusiastic about it."}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "Howard Norman's What Is Left the Daughter is structured as a long letter written by Wyatt Hillyer to his daughter Marlais for her 21st birthday in 1967. Wyatt's letter is a confession why he has consciously chosen to not have contact with her, and an account of his life and the events leading up to her birth.Orphaned at the tender age of 19 when both of his parents committed suicide by jumping off the same bridge, Wyatt had to move away from the big town of Halifax to the small village of Middle Economy in Nova Scotia, where he would live under the care of his aunt and uncle and work in his uncle's toboggan business. There he meets his cousin, Tilda, also a fellow orphan adopted by Wyatt's family, to whom he feels immediate attraction. But Tilda has other plans: aims to be a professional mourner in Nova Scotia and is interested in a German student, Hans Mohring, whose parents have fled the Nazis to Denmark and who came to Canada to study philology. It's 1942 and the war in Europe rages at its full fury, and the threat of German U-boats sinking ships in Canadian waters is very real to residents of the Atlantic provinces - among them Tilda's father, who is an amateur stenographer and fanatical listeners to war news on the radio, jotting down every iota of information and growing increasingly more suspicious of Hans.Norman's novel is quiet and understated: true to its form the tone is one of reflection and reminiscence, proper for a recollection of an older man remembering his dramatic youth. I had a hard time caring for any of the characters, even taking into account the fact that the whole novel is a subjective presentation of a series of Wyatt's memories. Wyatt himself was to passive and spineless to be a protagonist to root for, Hans was too distant a character and Tilda never felt quite real. I expected much more of the setting, which I thought was very underused - Atlantic Canada provides for memorable locale, with its rugged coastlines, foggy shores and unpredictable weather, combined with almost Gothic fishing villages with their closely knit communities - represented brilliantly by Annie Proulx in her The Shipping News and by Canadian writers such as Alistair Macleod, famous for writing about his native Cape Breton Island. In comparison, Norman's portrayal seems much like a small town cliche - reducing the setting to a plastic canvas instead of a rich background.The novel's biggest flaw is perhaps the storyline itself, which I found to be ultimately predictable and lacking novelty - even the period it's set in couldn't save it. That being said, Howard Norman is definitely an elegant writer who can craft fine sentences, and I would like to read his other novels where he hopefully does something with them."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Alaska)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska", "userReview": "... some ancient parable or other in which an elderly woman listens to her son hold forth about how much heartbreak, sour luck and spiritual depletion can be packed into a life. But talk as he might, the man from the parable fails to address the one thing his mother is most curious about. \"What of your daughter?\" she asks. \"Have you seen her? How is her life? Do not doubt that wonderment may be found when you find her again.\" Turns out, the man hasn't seen his own daughter in ages. \"Rain, wind, hunger, thirst, joy and sorrow have visited her all along,\" the woman says. \"yet her father has not.\" She listens more, all the while experiencing a deeper and deeper sadness, until finally she says, \"And what is left the daughter?\" She doesn't mean heirloom objects. She doesn't mean money. She doesn't care about anything like those. She says, \"I think you have a secret untold that keeps a distance between you and her and the life you were given.\"This is page one, and the beginning of a letter from a father to a daughter. A daughter he has not seen since she was quite small. It is a beautifully told, sometimes heart-wrenching story. As it progressed I sometimes I found my throat closing and my eyes spilling over with tears.The major action of the book takes place in the early days of World War II, though it is the influence of the war on these people's lives, and their reaction to it, not the war itself, that is important. The father, and therefore the central character, is Wyatt Hillyer. Through his words, we come to know him intimately. The other characters we know through his eyes, his impressions and telling of them. I have not read this author before, but even before I finished this, I was looking at his author page.

He writes because \"I refuse any longer to have my life defined by what I haven't told you.\" The story begins with his parents double suicide over their love for the same woman. It goes downhill from there. I expect grief and horror from a book set during the war, but usually that is accompanied by great human courage and sacrifice. This story seemed to be all senseless acts of violence and grief inflicted on innocent people by their loved ones. There were no heroes here and I didn't find much redemption either. The characters had little depth and I never felt like I understood them. Not a book for me, but it has been well reviewed by others.

But by the time, I had reached the middle, it became a little dull at parts.Don't get me wrong! This is still an amazing novel, just not as great as I expected.This book is written in the form of Wyatt, the narrator's letter to his daughter - a sort of confession.Wyatt is someone I sympathized a lot with. His parents' double suicide changed his life forever. What I really admired was Wyatt admitted to all his mistakes and never held back from admitting everything to his daughter.He described his life in an unbiased, honest manner which made me genuinely care for him.What is Left the Daughter also offers a glimpse on the prevailing paranoia during the war. Suspicion, hatred, prejudice prevailed in the hearts of people. A German was detested no matter what, even if innocent of all wrongdoings.Though it seemed to drag at times, it is still a beautifully written book that will linger in your mind. Its heartbreaking and won't be easy to forget.Favorite Quote:\"In The Highland Book of Platitudes, Marlais, there's an entry that reads, \"Not all ghosts earn our memory in equal measure.\" I think about this sometimes. I think especially about the word \"earn,\" because it implies an ongoing willful effort on the part of the dead, so that if you believe the platitude, you have to believe in the afterlife, don't you? Following that line of thought, there seem to be certain people\u2014call them ghosts\u2014with the ability to insinuate themselves into your life with more belligerence and exactitude than others\u2014it's their employment and expertise.\" Overall:Haunting and thought-provoking...Recommended?Yes!

This Washington writer maintains such a measured tone that his story seems shocking only in retrospect. At the time, you lean in, trying to catch every word, lulled by his voice as he describes the most ordinary lives that just happen to be punctuated by macabre accidents and bizarre acts of violence.Everything in \"What Is Left the Daughter\" sounds smothered in regret, worn smooth in the closet of a man's guilty conscience. It's a World War II tale that reminds us, again, of the innumerable tragedies spawned by war but born thousands of miles away from battle. The story opens, like his most famous book, \"The Bird Artist,\" with a confession: \"I've waited until now to relate the terrible incident that I took part in on October 16, 1942, when I was nineteen.\"The narrator is 43-year-old Wyatt Hillyer, who will spend the next 26 nights writing this long letter to his estranged daughter. It's a petition for her understanding and forgiveness, which Wyatt knows he can't expect. \"I have no way of knowing,\" he writes, \"if, after you've read a paragraph or two, any curiosity you might've had will abruptly sour to disgust, or worse.\" We never learn how his daughter reacts to this strange testimony, but you'll find it hard to resist his earnest appeal.An award-winning translator who teaches creative writing at the University of Maryland, College Park, Norman offers a kind of rough-hewn poetry throughout, starting with that Yoda-like title, \"What Is Left the Daughter.\" Wyatt is not a pretentious narrator -- he dropped out of high school and works as a maritime garbage collector -- but he's a determined student of language, who prizes the frayed \"Webster's\" he bought from a pawnshop for a dollar. There's an antique patina to his diction, although it's not pronounced: passing allusions to \"mute angels,\" a stillborn birth as a \"ghost child\" or a blacksmith \"taut of build.\" In the opening pages of his confession, he refers to John Keats and Emily Dickinson, an indication of the ardor that simmers just below the surface of his carefully chosen words.The odd disconnect between the novel's sober tone and its outrageous plot is on display as soon as Wyatt begins: \"Let me say it directly . . .\" Twenty-six years ago, on the day his parents discovered they were both having an affair with the same switchboard operator, they leapt from separate bridges in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Orphaned but almost a man, Wyatt moves in with his aunt and uncle and begins making mail-order toboggans. He also falls in love with their adopted daughter, Tilda, who works as a professional mourner at funerals. (Yes, the story is marked by distinctly unusual jobs; Howard Norman and Anne Tyler should open a Weird Employment Agency.)Wyatt's unrequited love for Tilda remains the foundation of his entire life -- \"She was too much beauty,\" he recalls -- but the story is propelled by his uncle's growing anxiety about the war. Like the father in Philip Roth's \"Plot Against America,\" Wyatt's uncle senses the danger of Hitler early but then lets it unhinge him. Hypnotized by static-laced radio reports of the U-boats prowling Canada's eastern shore, he can think and talk of nothing else. \"Your aunt complains that I'm becoming more and more agitated by the day,\" he tells Wyatt. \"Truth is, she only knows the half of just how agitated I am.\" Soon, the walls of his workshop are plastered with newspaper headlines of U-boat attacks, a reflection of the obsession colonizing his mind. It's a sad portrait of justified alarm and corrosive rage that ruins those he most wants to protect. (It's also a disturbing lesson on a bit of obscure history about what our northern neighbors suffered during World War II.)All of this develops with a muted but insistent sense of menace, which Norman signals by a series of surreal images, such as a bed covered in broken bits of Beethoven records. \"This war,\" a neighbor tells Wyatt, \" -- all of us are coming apart at the seams.\" When the \"terrible incident\" of Oct. 16, 1942, arrives, it's somehow shocking and inevitable, and Wyatt's culpability is brilliantly complicated. With just a few ordinary characters -- all strict, upstanding people, in a remote town that should feel safe and tranquil -- Norman catches a stray spark of war that incinerates several lives.The structure of the novel, though, puts considerable pressure on Norman's ability to maintain momentum. The act that alters the rest of Wyatt's life comes just halfway through the book, and even though it's a short novel, that leaves the whole second half for the narrator's stunned reflection on that tragedy. \"I've sometimes raced over the years like an ice skater fleeing the devil on a frozen river,\" he says, and that rushing survey of the years causes the story to flag as it sinks into the dark waters of his despair.But trust him. More strange revelations await in Wyatt's plea to his daughter. The novel gains traction again as he nears the conclusion, vowing that \"the truth is the truth, and in the end it can't be lost to excuses, cowardice or lies.\" It's a convincing demonstration of the truism he throws off so casually on the first page: \"Life is unpredictable.\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/..."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13639920-erin", "userReview": "So if we\u2019ve spent any time together you\u2019ll know that I (occasionally) refer to the book I\u2019m currently reading as \u201cthe best book ever.\u201d I recognize I have a problem with hyperbole; I\u2019m conscious of my excesses (most of the time). And so it happens once again that of late I\u2019ve been talking up a novel as perfect and exquisite, in this case, Howard Norman\u2019s What is Left the Daughter. But then! Circumstances conspired such that I boarded a bus, finished the last three pages of the novel, and had an entire hour and a half WITHOUT A BOOK with nothing to do but stare out the window and contemplate the book. And the more I sat and thought about What is Left the Daughter the less satisfied I became, the more contrived the ending, the more affected the tone, the more moralistic the plot (as if morals were, in their own right, dissatisfying).And so I find myself at something of a loss writing this review.Norman does tremendous, really tremendous, work grafting small, quotidian moments together to form rich, idiosyncratic yet utterly believable characters. Tiny scenes, like that of eating lunch on a bus, paradoxically distill and explode character in ways typically reserved for the best short stories.On the other hand the setting of small town - Middle Economy - Nova Scotia during WWII reads as a cliche of every small town you\u2019ve ever read (think of a blend of Richard Russo, Alistair MacLeod and Anne Tyler), complete with tiny diner and eccentric neighbours (so much so, in fact, that for the first 30 pages I wondered - truthfully - whether I\u2019d read the book before).The plot, too, balances the brilliant with the bland. I won\u2019t spoil the climax - as it is - but I was left gasping, shocked, and yet, convinced that it should happen that way (and so brilliant). But then the ending falls short. Another case of an author unwilling to do what is necessary in order to be truthful to the plot that\u2019s preceded and to the created characters. And with that said, the last two sentences are thematic perfection.And Norman\u2019s book raises all kinds of interesting questions about a national literature: is it setting that determines national lit? author\u2019s nationality? duration of an author\u2019s visit? thematic preoccupations? what\u2019s the point of national literature anyway? I\u2019ll not answer any of those questions, because I don\u2019t have to anymore. So without being able to articulate a decisive reaction to the text I\u2019ll ask instead \u2018when do we stop reading?\u2019 as I have a suspicion the characters of What is Left the Daughter and their decisions will continue to populate my waking thoughts for days to come - and maybe that means I\u2019m still reading? And so I can hold out hope that I\u2019ll make up my mind about the text sooner or later - except not wanting to actually have to decide. Maybe this is what we readers owe the brilliant (or the almost-brilliant in this case) books in our lives: that we take them around with us after, never wanting them to feel wholly settled, but rather perched just this side of comfortable."}, {"userName": "Lydia Presley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50581-lydia-presley", "userReview": "In a letter to his daughter, Marlais, Wyatt Hillyer begins with the following line:\"I refuse any longer to have my life defined by what I haven't told you.\" And I was drug, hook, line and sinker, into the story as told by the man himself in a 200+ page letter to his daughter.Wyatt Hillyer's life is a jumbled mess of tragedy - from the double-suicide of his parents to the loss of his one love during a time when Germans in Nova Scotia, even the innocent ones, are scorned and treated horribly. This book is a fantastic look at the Canadian life during the second world war, touching on the fears of old men hunched over their radios and whispering about the U-Boats to the prejudices of the young over-zealots, attacking even those speaking with an accent. And through this letter there is one, main, important theme: that of a father telling his daughter all she needs to know about her past and her fathers past.This is no story of redemption - Wyatt's actions he claims full responsibility for and I appreciated that so very much. In a book that could have been sappy and full of self-pity, I found none of that. It was refreshing to read a character who was so open and honest with himself and the others in his life, so frank when it came to talking about the deeds he's done and the crimes he's committed. The author Frank Delaney (Shannon Ireland ) said \"If your narrator is first person, have them make errors; it can endear them to the reader.\" and Howard Norman showcases this in fine form.

Toward the end of the novel, the narrator quotes the phonograph record liner notes for Casals' performance of Bach's unaccompanied cello suites, \"Casals succeeds in not allowing a single note of compromised sadness.\" The same could be said for Howard Norman in this haunting and deeply moving novel, written as a confession (apology, in the classic sense) from an aging father to his daughter. In Norman's other novels, there is a sense of resignation and inevitability, as people act from subconscious and deeply rooted motives. This novel retains that sense of fate and yet seems more at peace with it. Wyatt Hillyer is a matter-of-fact voice, even when relating the most distressing information, almost an observer of his own life. Norman's narration allows to to know people as we do in life, slowly and piecemeal.

Wyatt is such a bystander (loser) in his own life. I just could not empathize with him from the very start when he did not show complete devestation from the loss of both his parents. I would have preferred a storyline including more depth into his parents. I love Canada, but the war issues just seemed to go on and on. I just tended to glaze over during these periods. Also, I'm not a classical music fan and this also seemed to go on and on. Thus, I'm again glazing over. It was just oversaturation of the two for me. I did have a few chuckles (2 I think).

When he is a teenager, his parents commit suicide on the same day, driven to such extremes by their mutual romantic entanglements with a neighbor. This is only the first of a string of personal tragedies to befall him over the next several years. What Is Left the Daughter (a title referencing the concept of inheritance) is an epistolary novel, written by a father to his daughter. It chronicles World War II Canada, zeroing in on the anti-German sentiment that presided there during the Holocaust. So much of the tragedy that befalls Wyatt involves this very prejudice. It is also a story of unrequited love.Epistolary novels always have the potential to win big or fail miserably. This one falls somewhere in the middle. The writing is clean, even lyrical in places. However, the very format that propels the narrative also inhibits it. Because this is a letter from Wyatt to a daughter (Marlais) whom he barely knows, there is a certain detachment from the events that transpire. What was most frustrating about this story was its ample, but unrealized, potential for character exploration and development. Some pretty heavy things happen to this young man, but he never lets us in. We never feel their after-effects resonating within him. Wyatt is, instead, a lens through which we observe Canada at this historical juncture, often deflecting the spotlight from himself and casting it upon secondary and tertiary characters. Sometimes, these vignettes are effective. Other times, they make the narrative feel unfocused and even scattered. Wyatt's own letters contain two lines that elucidate my own frustrations with this story, the first spoken by Cornelia and the second by Wyatt himself: 1) \"'In her letters she refers to intimate things but doesn't describe things intimately'\" (197), and 2) \"I realize I've sometimes raced over the years like an ice skater fleeing the devil on a frozen river\" (223). Wyatt is, apparently, aware that he has shared little of himself in this story, and has at times glossed over events of enormous personal and historic magnitude.The author's writing is compelling. I would be curious to read other works by him. However, again, I found the epistolary format of this particular narrative to be limiting. Wyatt had the potential to be a rich, multifaceted character. Instead, he felt like a virtual stranger. Perhaps this was deliberate.

Wyatt, a true tragic hero, unravels his life from the beginning, the suicides of his parents, the elusiveness of love, the tragedy that pulled him and his daughter apart, the unfortunate reality of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The \"letter\" is set in Nova Scotia, mostly during WWWII. Norman weaves the historical incidents of German U boats, the attacks on Canadian civilians, and the blatant mistrust and hatred of German immigrants through the narrative. These events fuel and entangle the lives of the characters, creating pain and havoc and motivating one of the saddest destructive familial scenes I've ever come across in fiction. Upon finishing \"Daughter,\" I am left with a sense of relief on behalf of Wyatt, the same light and fatigued feeling one might have after coming clean about a lie or transgression or great hurt. This novel isn't about redemption--the confession itself is a redemptive act.Absolutely beautiful--and a wonderful slice of Canadian history during WWII."}, {"userName": "Jilanna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1501379-jilanna", "userReview": "Borrowed from Dave's Mom at her recommendation.Initially, I was not smitten with this book. Now that I have finished it, I would like to read more by Howard Norman. His characters are well drawn and true to life. I learned new things about Halifax Harbour and built on what I already new about rural Nova Scotia life in the mid 20th century.I found only one thing jarring in the whole thing -- the central characters mentions that he spends \"Canadian Thanksgiving and Christmas\" with his friends. Did Norman choose to use say \"Canadian Thanksgiving\" because (a) he lives in the US now and thinks the clarification is necessary; (b) the character is trying to provide specific context to the audience of his letter; or (c) Norman thinks this is an expression that the character would have used naturally. If it's (c), I don't think anyone who lives in Canada would call the holiday anything other than Thankgiving unless they were speaking / writing to someone \"from away\" who would only have been familiar with the American Thanksgiving holiday / tradition. I believe many Canadians refer to \"American Thanksgiving\" but never to our own holiday as \"Canadian Thanksgiving\" unless we're talking to someone from the States. I also wonder about the timing / context of the expression. I didn't get the impression that Wyatt had ever left the province and other than what he would have read in newspapers, etc, I'm not sure the difference between the two holidays would have mattered much to him."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina", "userReview": "What is Left the Daughter is one of those books I bought during my earlier buying sprees (2010) and never got around to reading. The dust jacket has beautiful artwork and I really like the title (although I want to put a question mark at the end of it). So I pulled it from the shelf a few weeks ago thinking I would give it a go. Unfortunately, I'm bored. Bored, bored, bored. This book is written as one long letter to the narrator's daughter, explaining to her basically the story of her parents' lives. It's full of love, lust, and betrayal set against the backdrop of World War Two. Unfortunately, I'm bored senseless. It's not the book's fault. It's well-written. The characters are quirky and probably interesting. There's a very dry wit to the writing. I recognize the humor--I just don't think it's funny. This book isn't very long (243 pages) but I had to stop at page 60. Life's too short, too many books, etc. The book reminds me of Christopher Guest's movies Best in Show and A Mighty Wind. The same type of gentle, dry wit and sly observations on human behavior. I didn't like those movies either even though I recognized that I should have found them funny. This book is exactly like that. The failure is with me, not the book (or the movies)."}, {"userName": "Elinor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4814788-elinor", "userReview": "This was a strange read for me. I picked up a copy based solely on the title, which is weird, and so I didn't have any pre-concieved notions about the content... which may have been good or may have been bad. I didn't especially like reading it. For instance, I didn't hop into bed ready to read like I do with most books, but once I was reading, I couldn't put it down! I felt the style of storytelling was somewhat slow, but I usually feel like that in first person narrative, so maybe that's just me. One great thing... I understand Canadian geography a lot better now! Plus, I am really interested in learning more about Canada during WWII, which, I know I'm an awful American, I had never really given much thought to.The following could possibly be construed as a spoiler...Someone dies... and usually when that happens in a book, I cry. But I didn't cry at all during this book, and I think that's because I didn't feel very invested in any of the characters. I did really like the way the book book-ended with comments on sermons, because it was something I identified with.

Set in Nova Scotia, the remoteness of the area is felt in the isolation of Wyatt's character. Tragedy and tension always seem to be brooding in the atmosphere. WWII, the threat of U-boats, the sinking of the Caribou all contribute to the dark emotions, which eventually change Wyatt's life forever. The dark tone of Wyatt's life could at times feel depressing and make me want to stop reading; but the importance of the \"Highland Book of Platitudes\" and classical music to the plot attached undertones of hope and understanding to the story, which kept me reading.

The style is almost unbearable, it is like listening to a story from someone who won't stop talking even to take a breath. I endured it expecting to get something out of it in the end, but I found it hollow. There are a lot of incidents and interactions that would shape a persons life, with absolutely no part of the story exploring that.

Mostly set in Nova Scotia in 1942, it is framed as a letter from Wyatt Hillyer to the daughter that he doesn't know, but that he fathered with his (mostly) unrequited love, Tilda. It tells the story of the Tilda's love for a German student at the height of WW II and its affect on the family and the town. I liked the \"no holds barred\" dialogue and irony that may be particularly Canadian or not, as well as the interior and exterior lives of people whose relationships led them down unexpected paths.

Seventeen-year-old Wyatt Hillyer is suddenly orphaned when his parents, within hours of each other, jump off two different bridges--the result of their separate involvements with the same compelling neighbor, a Halifax switchboard operator and aspiring actress. The suicides cause Wyatt to move to small-town Middle Economy to live with his uncle, aunt, and ravishing cousin Tilda. Setting in motion the novel's chain of life-altering passions and the wartime perfidy at its core is the arrival of the German student Hans Mohring, carrying only a satchel. Actual historical incidents--including a German U-boat's sinking of the Nova Scotia-Newfoundland ferry Caribou, on which Aunt Constance Hillyer might or might not be traveling--lend intense narrative power to Norman's uncannily layered story. Wyatt's account of the astonishing--not least to him-- events leading up to his fathering of a beloved daughter spills out twenty-one years later. It's a confession that speaks profoundly of the mysteries of human character in wartime and is directed, with both despair and hope, to an audience of one. An utterly stirring novel.
