What would be the point of that?\u201d Billie leans forward in her chair and rocks back and forth. \u201cWhat would be the point?\u201d she says. \u201cWhat would be the point?\u201d\nThat's My Baby opens in 1998, as Hanora Oak \u2013 the baby adopted at the end of Frances Itani's Giller Prize shortlisted Tell \u2013 is now an author in her seventies and starting her research on a little known Canadian artist, while distracted by personal issues. Told that she was adopted on her eighteenth birthday, Hanora has spent the past sixty years searching for her own identity, and through her writing research and her care for a cousin who is succumbing to dementia, Hanora discovers all the ways in which identities can be lost...and found. Unfortunately, I found the plot of this book to be too deliberate, the writing to be too uninspiring, and the entire reading experience to have been a little pointless.The timeline bebops between Hanora's life in the present \u2013 taking care of her cousin, Billie, who progressively loses her grip on reality, and researching the artist who, after suffering a concussion during a bombing raid in WWII, eventually lost her own mind \u2013 and Hanora's life from the time of her 18th birthday (when she learned she was adopted and essentially turned her back on the devoted parents who raised her), through a transatlantic voyage she and Billie made in 1939 (during which they made a fateful decision to switch identities for the trip), Hanora's years in England as a journalist, and a brief sketch of what came after the war. The jazz of Duke Ellington (who was also on that sea voyage), Ella Fitzgerald, and others of that era, figures prominently (and provides many of the best scenes in the book), and much is made of art (painting, writing, photography) and its value in preserving a person's individuality. In the end, I found there to be just too many coincidences and repetitions of themes to make the whole believable, and for what is essentially a melodrama, the story never touched me emotionally. Sometimes the writing was lyrical, as when Hanora discovers that her cousin has been keeping bizarrely detailed lists of everything she eats:\nHow long has Billie's memory been slipping away?She has written a history of eating. Of sustenance.A history of insomnia.A history of tears.And fears.On paper, as if to make herself real, Billie has been doing whatever she could, in futile attempts to preserve her sense of self.\nBut most of the time, the writing was minimalistic:\nThere is no one left to ask about location anymore. Well, remote cousins would be living around there somewhere. Descendants of descendants of pioneer families. She could also return to Deseronto to see who is still around town. Breeda, for one. Breeda never left. She and Saw raised their family there. They stay in touch once a year, exchanging messages at Christmas. Calhoun is still alive and lives with Breeda and Saw. Calhoun is now 103.\nAnd I found it all a little dull. A little pointless. Just not for me."}, {"userName": "Penny (Literary Hoarders)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3727008-penny-literary-hoarders", "userReview": "After reading two books close together that were electric with current political issues, I needed to take a step back, to calm and quiet my mind and calm my soul. I knew Frances Itani would help me achieve this as I stepped back in time to revisit Deseronto, Ontario. That's My Baby has a lot of soul and heartache inside. It's the story of Hanora and her older and beloved cousin, Billie. Hanora has known since she was 18 years old that she was adopted. At the end of Itani's story Tell, we discover the identities of Hanora's biological and adoptive parents. For Hanora however, it was a life long search shrouded tightly in secrecy and is one she does not find out the full truth until her later years. Now in the late 90s, Billie is losing more of herself and her memory to dementia, and this part of the story is filled with great sadness and heartache. Itani is wonderfully great with her portrayal of Billie's confusion, fear and anxiety as she sinks deeper into memory loss. There were some sections that were repetitive to the point of irritation however. The constant name dropping of Duke Ellington wore thin for me, but overall, a very slight irritation in the grand overall story. This was a touching, and yes, calming and quieting book. It was good to return to Deseronto and visit with the characters that have been featured before in Deafening and Tell."}, {"userName": "Catherine Coles", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6470611-catherine-coles", "userReview": "This novel drifts back and forth between the 1990s and the 1930s-40s following a woman named Hanora. In the 90s, she is an accomplished writer working on a new book, as well as caregiver to her older cousin who is suffering from dementia. In the pre-WWII period, she is a young woman who has recently been told she was adopted. Little does 1990s Hanora know that through researching her new book, she will finally be able to piece together the truth about her birth parents. Although I found it a bit slow, THAT'S MY BABY is well-researched (plenty of great Eastern Ontario historical details!) and has a satisfying ending.

An engrossing story line, a compassion for soldiers, especially the young and damaged from the first world war, a portrait of small town Ontario and characters you can fall in love with. How does one find out who they are after they have found out they are not who they thought they were? A novel of love, discovery, compassion and empathy as well as loss and disappointment and growing up and growing old. It's all here in this beautiful novel. Once you open the cover, you will not put it down until the end. A most satisfying way to spend an afternoon on the porch with tea, cookies and Frances Itani at her best."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9290847-valerie", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book,and read it out of sequence, so I need to go back and read Tell.

In 1938, adoptions were a closed door but she yearns to learn who her parents were. The novel goes back and forth between the years of WWII and 1998. In the present, Hanora is an author starting a book about an obscure painter and helping her cousin and closest friend cope with her increasing dementia.

This book follows the life and times of Hanora Oak who is told on her 18th birthday of her adoption and who struggles throughout her life to learn the identities of her biological father and mother. The novel deals with the issues of identity and memory. Near the end Hanora's beloved cousin succumbs to dementia and at one point poignantly asks her,\" What did you say my name was?\" There is a lively interlude on a ship bound for Europe in 1939 when the cousins exchange identities for a lark, with unforseen consequences. Hanora becomes a successful journalist and delves into the life of a noted Ontario artist whose life unexpectedly becomes intertwined with hers. At the end a tragedy reveals the truth behind her parentage. Many people preferred Deafening the first novel in the series but I liked this story because it takes place outside of rural Ontario into the wider world and the events surrounding WWII including the Blitz and the bombing of Coventry."}, {"userName": "Mary Lou", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4109842-mary-lou", "userReview": "Expectations are always high when I open an Itani book. If this were a book by a lesser writer I might have been impressed. The writing had much of Itani\u2019s observant eye, and many images that took my breath away, but the story lacked punch. It\u2019s connected to both Tell and Deafening, but lacks the richness of characters and characterization of those two master works. Honora, the main character, is informed on her eighteenth birthday that she was adopted, and that tilts her world for essentially the rest of her life. It\u2019s a life of accomplishment, but she continues to feel that she is missing a piece of herself. The story is told mostly as remembrance and flashback while the present day story line crawls ahead, and long before the book reached its predictable conclusion I had lost interest. Because it was Itani\u2019s work, I didn\u2019t abandon it before the end \u2014 but I was tempted. Perhaps she\u2019s dipped into the community of Deseronto one too many times."}, {"userName": "Linda Saunders", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22549504-linda-saunders", "userReview": "This review is an odd one, for me.

I read several of Frances Itani\u2019s earlier pieces... loved \u201cTell\u201d, and eagerly awaited this new one which somehow, I understood was a sequel to it. I announced to anyone, who would listen, that this one was a huge disappointment... that it was disjointed and a \u201cslog\u201d for me. For some reason I carried on reading...at a snail\u2019s pace...still complaining that I wasn\u2019t enjoying it, in the least. This morning, I finished it and I must confess... I truly enjoyed it!Such a cleverly woven story...rife with real life characters that emerge, as whole, in the last few chapters. I am so thankful that I kept at it.

Deseronto is revisited, our protagonists Hanora\u2019s home town. As we follow Hanora\u2019s quest to find her birth parents we learn about her journalism career, her relationship with her cousin Billie who is dealing with demencia and her true love Tobe.

My issue with this novel is that it's full of multiple story lines that deserved their own novels. I wanted an entire novel about Hanora & Tobe. I wanted an entire novel about Billie and Whit. I wanted an entire novel about Mariah. Instead I found a novel full of teasing, fascinating dips into their lives...but just as I was getting involved in their stories, a forced track switch occurs.

What intrigued me about this one, part three of the trilogy, is that it is also about an elderly adoptee in the 1990s who long ago gave up on knowing the truth about her origins.\"After decades of travelling down blind alleys, she'd long ago accepted the fact that she does not and probably will not own her history. Maybe that's why she has so interested in everyone else's. She's never had a history of her own. Which can also be seen as nonsense, goes the old argument with herself. She has a very complete history, comprising work she has done, decisions made, people met, travels undertaken, books published, friendships near and dear.\"This is the reality lived by Hanora, who, approaching 80, has lived a full life yet still lives with a primal curiosity about her origins, made all the more poignant as she believes there is nobody left alive who can tell her about where she came from.I can relate to the character of a curious, history-loving storyteller who is denied her own story because I am one. I'm luckier than Hanora as I was raised in a later era and had the good fortune to find out about my family history as a young adult when restrictions were loosened. But there is a bit of the seeker on a quest in every adoptee. What is taken for granted by others is something we must undertake a hero's journey to achieve.This novel isn't just about Hanora's hero's journey; in fact, she lives a rich and multi-faceted life outside of her adoptee quest. Coping with her aging cousin's Alzheimer's, forging new relationships in her golden years, and playing an active role in the major events of the 20th century, WW II in particular, are also aspects of this story.And it all comes together in a delicious twist that gives Hanora the surprise of her life in her senior years. Well worth the read, especially for those who are part of the adoption triangle."}], "description": "A new Deseronto novel from the internationally bestselling author of Tell and DeafeningAt the end of Frances Itani\u2019s Scotiabank Giller Prize\u2014shortlisted Tell, a baby is adopted by a young Deseronto couple who are coming to terms with the end of the Great War.
