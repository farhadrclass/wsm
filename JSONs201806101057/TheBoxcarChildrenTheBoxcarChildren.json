I'm a detail-oriented person, and this book speaks to the super organized control freak in me. Warner weaves so many details into the lives of the Boxcar children that, as a young'un, I found myself mentally picturing their home in exquisite detail. Over a decade since I last read it, I still remember the milk kept cool by the waterfall, or the kids carrying the cherries back to the boxcar between them. These details are the strength of the book - for the little girl or boy who liked playing house and inventing routines, this book is perfect escapism.The book is by no means perfect - the children are saccharine, never fight and they don't seem to have much in the way of distinct personalities beyond their age-directed roles in the family unit. Also, as the series goes on, I was always confused as to why they inexplicably began solving mysteries, since this first book has nothing to do with anything like that. The book really does romanticize homelessness tremendously as well. Nothing bad ever befalls the children, they never go hungry or have any serious problems in meeting all their basic needs. Still, because of how much I loved this book, I can't help giving it a better rating than it probably deserves, if only to reflect how much dang fun it was for me to read and re-read as a child."}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9840725-sherry", "userReview": "When I was young, around the age of 7 I think, my mother was hospitalized for several months. I went to stay with my aunt and uncle. I missed my parents dreadfully. One warm afternoon while wandering around around on their property, I found a box of old books in a barn of sorts. I picked up The Boxcar Children and begain to read. My loneliness disappeared, and my life changed forever. The story pulled me in and I couldn't put it down. I felt as if I was a part of their adventures and the boxcar. Since that day 50 years ago, I have been an avid reader. I read this book to my children, I have even shared it with my grandchildren. I have an original copy and I will pass it down to one of my children when I pass.To the adults that read this book and gave it low reviews, I think to really enjoy this book you must be a child. The simple mystery, and exploration is made for a young child's mind.Yet the sad truth is children are now spoon feed TV, DVDs and Video games at an early age, little imagination is needed. Maybe thats it, maybe this book is just to simple now days."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I never came across this book as a child - presumably it did not cross the Atlantic to the UK where I grew up on a diet of the Secret Seven and the Famous Five. So I thought I would check it out now as it sits at the top of many popularity lists.Having read all the reviews I think many people must be giving it five stars just for nostalgia value because to an adult outsider like me it certainly does not get five stars for content! However it is a nice, child friendly story with a degree of action but nothing truly scary or worrying. The four children are caring and sharing and totally unreal, but this is fiction we are reading! Today's children would still enjoy it for the pure fun of reading about four children setting up home in a box car and making a success of it. I can understand why it is so popular and why it holds a special place in the hearts of those who read it years ago."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "I absolutely LOVE this book and the entire BOXCAR CHILDREN series!!!

As a boy, I had been a fan of Enid Blyton's books, which were largely set in Britain, so I was curious to see how something similar from the US would read. I had also read that The Boxcar Children series is still very popular among kids despite having started in the 1940s.As the book was first published 70 years ago, I was expecting it to be somewhat old-fashioned and sexist. To some degree this is true. The four orphaned children mimic the typical white middle-class family with the older boy and girl taking on parental roles towards the younger girl and boy according to a largely traditional sexual division of labour. Henry, the older boy, goes into town to do odd jobs so that he can earn money to buy food and other needed items, such as a tablecloth, for himself and his siblings. Jessie, the older girl, stays at home to mind the younger kids (at one point cutting Benny's hair) and acts as a housekeeper, washing clothes and cooking meals. Similarly, Henry makes a cart for Benny while Violet is thrilled to hem the new tablecloth and Jessie makes a broom. However, the girls are also resourceful in locating an old dump from which cracked, but serviceable, crockery and a cooking kettle could be salvaged. They also make, with the help of little Benny, a stone-lined fire-pit over which the kettle could be suspended from a wire strung between two trees. Jessie also made a ladle from a tin cup fastened to a stick and used charcoal to write words on sheets of wrapping paper so that Benny could start learning to read. But the kids also work together to build a small dam across a stream and instead of Henry using his age and gender to dictate what the group should do, he often asks Jessie for her advice. It is probably because he is the eldest that Henry is always the one to light the fire, and it is his strength (as the oldest and biggest child) that is sometimes needed to lift heavier rocks.The book subtley teaches some practical wisdom - to always drink water from a water pump or fountain as opposed to a brook, that things can be recycled, to use boiling water to rinse off crockery found in a dump instead of just washing it in cold water, to use sand as a scouring agent, how to manage time (Jessie washing everyone's stockings while the others built the dam), using pine needles as bedding, locating a hearth away from anything that might catch fire (and having a container of water to hand in case something did catch light), and so on.The children are also respectful of other people's property, with for example Henry asking permission to take stunted vegetables thinned out from a vegetable patch or bent nails from a garage rather than presuming to take them even though they would've been discarded anyway. The overall impression I have of reading the book is that the kids are very practical and independent (except, not unreasonably, when it comes to illness). They seem to belong to a can-do generation unlike many of today's children whom, I feel, are more dependent and infantilised. Many schools in the US apparently ban kids of even high school age from possessing or using a pointed pair of scissors because it could hurt somebody. Likewise pen-knives are forbidden. And how many kids today could make a broom, hem a cloth or make a cart without the help of parents or other adults? Books like The Boxcar Children therefore serve as useful and accessible repositories of practical knowledge and advice that kids today and in the future can learn and that will hopefully encourage them to explore, make, repair, and innovate in ways that endless hours of computer games and cartoons on TV will not.A couple of things that made me go 'hmmm' include the kids not hearing thunder as they slept outside in a wood (is that even possible?), or the description of the kids after a day spent cherry-picking as being 'better than most workers, because [they] are so happy' (so most workers should go about their work gleefully in order to be considered 'good'?). Henry also seems to be a bit dense later in the story in not recognising a man he had only seen a day or two before - but this is probably to add a little tension to the narrative and to get any kids reading the book a bit frustrated over how long Henry was taking to figure it out. Apart from these minor quibbles, this is a book I would recommend to any child old enough to read it - and maybe for those adults who want to catch up with aspects of their childhood that they missed."}, {"userName": "Raevyn Oswald", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58559897-raevyn-oswald", "userReview": "NOTE: I read the 1924 version, not the newer and more popular edition.

I never thought of all the gender stereotypes because I knew that it was an old book and you often see that in old books. Come on, there is a \"horse and cart\" coming down the road, the boys are wearing short pants and stockings, and the girls have on kerchiefs over their heads. Clearly this is not a modern book and we don't need to expect it to be modern. Kids reading it should not be changed or affected by the gender stereotypes because they should be able to understand that in the past, things were very different than how they are now. To children reading this when it was re-released in 1942, children who had been through the great depression, this book told them what kind of people they should be... ever optimistic even in hard times, good at working together toward a common goal without fighting with each other, self-relient and hard working. Good lessons for kids in any time period, including today. History of it, for those interested.....People think it came out in 1942.But they often don't know this actually came out in 1924 but few copies were made and it is extremely hard to find an original. The books is very different from the current version.I do have one, and many things were changed. Some of the characters names are different, there are a lot more adventures in the book (the current version is shortened), and the kids actual mom and dad are included in the beginning of the book before they died (and it was a bit darker, because apparently they got drunk a lot and were not said to be good parents- so if you thought it was odd that the kids aren't upset over their dead parents, well, maybe that's why). The book was also a lot more descriptive than now. But anyway, it was published by a different company in 1924. Then, in 1942, it was re-published but the new company had the author re-write it to simplify it for younger children to read. That's why there are all the changes.The current version, the 1942 version, is the same as the version you read today."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1002575-katie", "userReview": "If I had just given this a rating instead of feeling the need to re-read it, I would have clicked five stars and moved on with my life.

The only reason I gave it two stars was out of respect for the sliver of memory I have left of enjoying it.

She said she identified with the children who had to take care of themselves. I don't think that's a compliment to my grandparents. Anyway, reading this makes me realize how much children's literature has changed. The plot is like Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events - orphan siblings using their own resources to help themselves. But the tone is so sugary sweet it gives me a toothache. The children are always happy when they're working, never seem to miss their parents or complain about sleeping in a haystack or a boxcar, and never even think about getting on each other's nerves. Would I have liked this if I had read it as a child? A very, very young, innocent child?

Though I probably read it a dozen times as a child, I hadn't looked at it since about fourth grade. I was impressed, when I read the graphic novel, how much I remembered from the original... Benny's pink cup, the swimming pool, the wonderful domesticity of everything, to the point of spending scarce money on salt and stockings just to remain civilized. I've always been an enthusiastic player of the game 'House,' and to this day books like the Boxcar Children are the only reason my dishes get washed in a timely manner. I also found that one of the most discomfiting features of the graphic novel is its rampant use of contractions, which Ms. Warner seemed to avoid as much as possible, even at the cost of some realism. When I finished the novel and was tempted to read on in the series, I suddenly remembered how little use I'd had for the rest of the books... the mysteries were charming enough, but nothing could top the great adventure of four children surviving so brilliantly on their own wits and skills. Children today (and of my generation, and probably one or two before it) don't really have those skills--when adolescent boys carry knives now they are rarely for whittling, and I certainly didn't learn how to cook a nice stew until I was well past childhood. But we all wish we did, and we hope that our own triumphs are as courageous and innovative as making a proper home out of an old train car. In its way, this book has the same appeal as a fantasy novel, where the protagonists (usually heroines, in my library) learn all sorts of magic and swordplay by their twelfth birthdays. Though to my (more or less) adult eyes, the story is quite dated, the world the Alden children live in is absolutely magical, and I'm so happy to have revisited it."}, {"userName": "Nadin Adel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11745055-nadin-adel", "userReview": "A novel about orphan siblings whom ran away from their grandfather that they never saw and knew he would treat them badly, as he didn't like their late mother.

I know many people don't have any way of knowing this, so I'm so grateful that I know. I still remember the day I walked into my 5th grade classroom in 2008, and there was a little bookshelf in the corner with a green beanbag. It was my first time in an American classroom, and I had never read an English book before. My homeroom teacher told us that if we read anything there, she'd give us a sticker! So I went, sat on the beanbag, and looked at the books. I found this one, with a group of kids and this bright red train on the cover.So I opened it, and to my delight, there were drawings! I loved the drawings, and I loved the four kids, their dog, and their boxcar. I remember connecting to the children so much, despite not being an orphan or in the 1950s, because I was so overwhelmed at this new world. And these kids were, too, but they had each other. I had them. They were determined to survive, no matter what, and so was I. I've read almost every single book in this series, and the first is still the one I know and remember the most. And of course, love the most.Rereading now, exactly 10 years later, I see how simple the language is. The concept is also pretty freaking crazy if you think about it - these kids in the middle of the woods somehow manage to not die for a month. But still! I love it. I will always love them. When I wasn't very familiar to reading English, this helped. This little tiny book encouraged me to keep reading about their adventures, to keep improving my English, to keep reading.
