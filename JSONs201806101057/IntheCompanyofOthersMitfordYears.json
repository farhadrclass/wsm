It's a device used in ancient Greek drama, where having written themselves into a corner, the author would add a god coming down from the heavens (lowered on stage w/a crane) to solve everything.Well, I've decided that that's what Father Tim has become. He swoops down from the sky (in this case from an airplane) and by the time he and Cynthia leave all the wrongs have been righted, everyone has found God (the Episcopal sort, even if they're Catholics) and they all live happily ever after.Don't get me wrong. I like Karon. And I really like Father Tim. But taking him further and further from Mitford, from those wonderful characters who feel so real, is diminishing her writing.And if she wanted to write a story about the diary characters, fine, then she should have done that instead of plunking it into her book here. I skipped virtually every entry, wanting to get back to the REAL story."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1731678-nancy", "userReview": "Another reviewer suggested the Father Tim / Mitford books were an example of \"deus ex machina.\" Made me laugh--although I tend to agree. But--isn't this why readers select these books and return to Father Tim and his wise counsel, again and again? Because he provides a template for hope when our worldly cares seem insurmountable. The fact that the hope provided is the deus part of the literary convention doesn't detract from the writing.While the overall pattern in every book is the same--Tim is reluctantly at the center of One Big Mess, and finds the right words to handle difficult people and deeply rooted problems--it's nice to see a bit of Ireland, meet jolly companions, and wade around in a gentle theology.One of my former Episcopal priests said (about the Father Tim/Mitford books) \"Oh, I read one of them and wasn't moved to read another. Clearly, the author is in love with her priest!\" I tend to agree with him, too--and kind of admire the author's chutzpah in writing herself a lovely role as helpmeet.Jan Karon's books are reliably sweet in nature and just different enough to keep me reading."}, {"userName": "Missy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/769225-missy", "userReview": "It's been several years, but I used to enjoy the Mitford series books. So when I saw this on the \"high demand\" shelf at the library, I picked it up and looked forward to another comfortable, enjoyable read. The setting is Ireland (Father Tim and Cynthia are on vacation). I enjoyed the descriptions of the setting and language - a lot of similarities to Scotland where I was a missionary - but overall this was my least favorite of Karon's books. First, there were way too many characters. I tried to keep them straight, but there was a rather large chunk of the book - somewhere about halfway to 2/3 of the way through - where I had no idea what was going on. I couldn't remember who was who or what everyone's relation was to everyone else. Turns out it didn't matter as much as I thought it would in the end, but still... Father Tim and Cynthia find an old Journal at the Inn where they are staying and they read from it regularly. It's interesting and I loved the people in the journal, but I found it awkward at times and couldn't figure out what the point was in relation to everything else going on at the moment. Also, I didn't particularly like Karon's writing style. This is billed as \"A Father Tim Novel\" and when she refers to him she simply says \"he\" or \"him,\" never calling him by his name unless someone else is specifically saying it. This gets confusing when Tim is talking to another male and you aren't sure who she is referring to at certain points in the conversation or she says \"He went somewhere...\" and it's vague which \"he\" she is referring to. Overall, I liked the story and I do like a book which wraps everything up in a pretty little package when all is said and done. In that regard, this book didn't disappoint, but there were way too many times in the thick of it when I was confused. I was so glad when it was over. 2.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5394427-joyce", "userReview": "This book is harder to read than any of the others by this author that I have read. Harder in that I have to work hard to follow who the characters are. There is so much history in it, which is wonderful. It's almost as difficult as ferreting out one's one family history. Still reading ...I really enjoyed reading this book. I mistakenly thought this was Father Tim's family, while it turns out to be the innkeeper's family. All in all, they are as close as family by the time Tim and Cynthia leave. Masterful story-telling, fabulous characters and relationships among so many in just one book! To quote the author from the back fly-leaf, 'Of all the novels I've written, In the Company of Others is my personal favorite, my dark-haired child.' --Jan KaronI highly recommend this book, either in sequence with the Mitford series or as a stand alone story, to all readers, including teens.

I loved them all so much I decided to read them again along with the new Father Tim series. It is so refreshing to read about honest, decent people dealing with regular life in a quaint and humorous way. IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS failed in my expectations. The story takes the Cavanaugh\u2019s to Ireland and places them in the middle of characters that the story is really about. I felt the plot was weak and there were too many characters to keep track of. The middle of the book was downright boring. Karon has said this was her favorite book, of all she has written.

It was a confusing mixture of two plot lines: one about Father Tim and Cynthia vacationing at a quaint family-run inn in Ireland, the second set in the mid-nineteenth century at the same locale. The 19th century story line was left mid-air with a quick and unsatisfying tie down. The contemporary plot line included so many characters I needed a roster to keep them all straight. Finally, Tim and Cynthia were portrayed as being drawn into the family drama on a very intimate level and I just couldn't buy it.

The other characters were also very well-drawn. I liked the setting in Ireland - good description of places, language, and culture. The book had a story within a story when the couple read a journal written more than a generation previously by the man who built the large country house near the B&B where they were staying in Ireland. I listened to this as a book on tape while I was driving, and I found the switching back and forth between present and past a bit irritating and not particularly relevant. This may have worked better if I had been reading a paper copy. Listening, however, was fun because of the Irish accents! The book's climax was a bit preachy, but I could deal with that. The plot was slow-paced and not especially surprising or interesting. The real strength was the characters and the way Karon celebrated everyday life, caring human interaction, and framed it all within an overtly Christian worldview without having it be too preachy most of the time."}, {"userName": "Kathrine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2252892-kathrine", "userReview": "After reading all the Mitford books, this book did not hold a candle.

I especially enjoyed the first Father Tim novel, which seemed to be a bit edgier than the previous Mitford series. This book was a bit disappointing to me. I expected much more from a book set in Ireland. Except for the attempt at local dialect (which I listened to as an audiobook) there was nothing much Irish about the setting, or representative of the culture. While the characters were interesting, and the humor was there, it was difficult to sort out who was who and how they were all related. I also found this book's message bordering on proselytizing which got tiresome. And the last minute change of heart of deeply embittered and wounded characters was just not believable.Audio version read by Erik Singer. Description from back of box: Father Time and Cynthia arrive in the west of Ireland, intent on researching his Kavanagh ancestry from the comfort of a charming fishing lodge. The charm, however, is broken entirely when Cynthia startles a burglar and sprains her already injured ankle. Then a cherished and valuable painting is stolen from the lodge owners, and Cynthia's pain pales in comparison to the wound at the center of this bitterly estranged Irish family.Series info:#2 of seriesSee: Home to Holly Springs"}, {"userName": "Catherine Leggitt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8062525-catherine-leggitt", "userReview": "As I turned the last page, an overwhelming sadness dropped over me. I didn't want to leave this cozy Irish fishing lodge. I'd become so enthralled with the place, visualization facilitated by Jan Karon's awesome mastery of the language. The book is beautifully written. I took this life-altering vacation on the shore of Lough Arrow along with retired Episcopal priest Tim Kavanagh and his wife Cynthia. They came for much needed rest, but got an adventure instead. An intruder startles Cynthia, resulting in an injury to her ankle. A valuable painting vanishes without a trace. Relationships are not what they appear at first glance. Behind the civility and grand hospitality lurk ugly secrets. The Kavanaghs (and the reader) are quickly drawn into the lives of this Irish family.An old journal illuminates family dynamics. Unforgiveness is at the core of the problem. Reconciliation is the heart of this story. The amazing beauty of the love of God washes away long-held resentments and pain, making this book unforgettable. Love the plot and the resolution.One small fly in the ointment--I found the Irish dialect off-putting and hard reading at times, particularly in the many pages of journal and I fought the desire to skim over much of it. For that reason, had there been a 4.5 rating, that would have been my choice."}, {"userName": "Tonya", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/878615-tonya", "userReview": "Jan Karon is like a fine wine. She gets better and better as the years go on. I loved In the Company of Others. There are so many passages I would like to quote. I agree with Ms Karon, this is her finest yet. Beautiful scenery depicted to us. Tim and Cynthia have one of the most wonderful blessed relationships and I long to be like them. What a wonderful model for us all. The whole mystery of who was in the cabinet, who stole the painting, just brilliant! I loved the journal writing. I couldn't wait for them to open it every time! There wasn't a character I didn't like. I think it is somehow how Ms Karon writes that all the characters just come, and I don't confused when she introduces us to that many somehow. Then there is Bella, a young woman, feeling so many different things, as teenagers tend to do. What a beautiful picture of God's grace and mercy. The same can also be said for Evie, or Evelyn. No matter what you do, or how much you think you are in control, God is the one and only. If you weren't in tears or deeply moved by this book, I am sorry you missed the boat.I don't mind waiting 3 years for a book like this. It will stay with me forever.

Jan Karon\u2019s books are what used to be called \u201ccozies\u201d. While you read the book you feel wrapped in a hug and the book leaves you feeling better for having read it. For those looking for the \u201cMitford Books\u201d, those are a different series (9). \u201cIn the Company of Others\u201d is part of the Father Tim (2) series, which is set after his retirement and, thus far, outside of Mitford. Father Tim remains the main character and old friends from Mitford have bit parts, but we get to meet new friends as well.In \u201cIn the Company of Others\u201d Father Tim & his wife Cynthia finally visit Ireland, for a two week holiday, her birthday present, and based them at a country inn Father Tim had visited many years ago. Cynthia, unfortunately, injures her ankle and they must stay at the inn instead of doing the usual tourist rush about the country. This allows Ms. Karon time to unfold her story slowly and deeply and to draw us into the characters lives as surely as Father Tim and Cynthia are. Moreover, Father Tim and Cynthia find a handwritten journal written by a doctor who had lived in 1860's and read them since Cynthia is limited in what she could do (the end \u2013 in the graveyard \u2013 had me in tears, but not of sorrow). I found the story in the diary fascinating and wanted more. Both stories, modern and historical, ring full of real life: things not going as planned, family drama and conflict, secrets kept, regret and remorse, opportunities missed. In this book, Ms. Karon goes deeper than the usual \u201ccozy\u201d and it is a blessing where we are reminded sometimes listening is the greatest gift one can give another and confession can bring reconciliation and peace. I love Tim and Cynthia\u2019s relationship, their quiet faith, the struggles with God & faith experienced by other characters, the journal, and Ireland as painted by Ms. Karon \u2013 I want to go visit now."}, {"userName": "Merand", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931487-merand", "userReview": "It has been a long time since Karon published a book. Such a long wait usually makes me quite anxious to read the next book and I was but I didn't devour this book. Instead it was a little bit slow and I actually set it aside to read another quick book.I love Karon's Mitford series and the life, hope, simplicity, and spirit that it is infused with. These \"Father Tim\" books are similar and yet not quite the same. For one thing, the book is entirely from Father Tim's perspective as opposed to a variety of perspectives in the Mitford books (they are mostly Father Tim but there is a shifting viewpoint from time to time). I have found the Father Tim books to be a little more introspective and melancholy as well.This was a treat however for fans of the Mitford series who know of Father Tim's long desire to go to Ireland to look up his ancestors. While we don't read first hand of his first trip there, this second trip with Cynthia, his wife, is long-anticipated as well. It adds a mystique to be set in Ireland with its entirely different scenery and colorful language and different traditions. While not being overly descriptive, Karon imbues a wonderful sense of place to this novel. And of course it is filled with a whole cast of wonderful characters to learn to love, hate, cry with, chide, and enjoy. It's refreshing to bring Father Tim out of his typical setting and role of priest to Mitford but his passion for God and people is still ever at the fore and as always it brings me an encouragement in my own faith. This is certainly a book that can be read on its own for those not familiar with the Mitford series or the prvious Father Tim book but for those familiar with Tim and Cynthia, there is an added enjoyment and depth to the story."}, {"userName": "Sandra Olshaski", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3818891-sandra-olshaski", "userReview": "In the Company of Others by Jan Karon (Rated: C)ISBN: 978-0-670-02212-0Viking PressPublished October 30, 2010Hardcover, 399 pagesReviewed by SandraThe unlikely protagonist is a 70-year-old retired Episcopalian priest named Tim.

Instead Father Tim and Cynthia have finally gone on vacation to Ireland. While there, they will meet new friends, get caught up in the lives (and company) of others, and hopefully vacation.As someone who loves this series, I can't not like this book. But I didn't love it. The scenery was great, the people in Broughadoon were interesting, but the book didn't sing the way others have. In part, I think it was a reaction to the different setting (I had a similar response when reading _A New Song_) but I think also the drama was not as compelling. There were several cases where I felt the author was twisting the plot to get to her ends, not letting the plot unfurl.Still, there were moments throughout the book where I found what I look for in these novels: the quiet grace, the trust in faith, the focus on what really matters.

It sounded right up my alley, too: a long-planned trip to Ireland to explore Tim's Irish heritage, a very out-of-the-way village complete with wandering sheep and torrential Irish rain, cozy hearths and ruddy-cheeked old men telling tall tales by the fire, et al. It just didn't hold my attention. I was pleasantly surprised by the characterization, I must say, especially of Tim and his wife Cynthia. I'd expected something more superficial and cardboard-cutout. Still, I just couldn't get into it, and the heavily accented dialogue did not help. I find that very distracting. A little is fine, to give it some flavor, but accents should never dominate the dialogue. Once you've established it, you can lay off and assume the reader's 'ear' will take it from there.

The rawness of anger and hurt displayed by some characters was effectively countered by honesty and humor in others that revealed the depth of so many in this novel.

Too much in it to absorb in one reading, so I need to save it to read again another time. This of course intrigued me because it was Father Tim & Cynthia on a trip to Ireland ... a place I had long desired to visit, and got to do so last summer. Then it concerned one of my favorite themes ... forgiveness ... in giant proportions. The journal of the history of former owners of the inn I must keep for another time ... it was just too much story to get in one reading, so another time I will more fully enjoy the journal entries. So inspired to enjoy a time of repentance, renewal, refreshment, and revival myself!"}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51647109-cathy", "userReview": "My mom had grown interested in rereading this series, but we had not gotten so far along in it the first time around, so I got her this book and then read it afterwards.Jan Karon's books are generally slow-paced tales of kindness and connection, but this one seemed to be slower paced than most, owing mostly to Cynthia's ankle problems. It seemed to me that the first half of the book was about people sitting around reading to each other, or sharing odd and apt quotes. And I might enjoy doing that myself for an hour or two, but this seemed prolonged.I think partly my own life and the lives of those people I care about have been so hectic, adventurous, or dramatic that it's hard to slow my own heart rate down to the level of this book. But it's a good contrast to my life at the moment, good to slow down.The book did have a plot, too, although it took awhile to develop, and even a mystery or two, although this is not in the mystery genre. I did not guess whodunit.The chapter where they sat around and told each other funny jokes was good, too. I read that to one of my kids waiting for a dr.'s visit. Uncle Billy, a prior character in the series, did it better, though.Tim and Cynthia read each other an old Irish journal from the 1860's of a practicing physician, and that journal grew on me. I enjoyed hearing about their way of life and their concerns, some of which were familiar, and some of which are so foreign to our way of life and thinking, and so different from the rest of the Mitford series, too. When the police officers had to take the journal away in order to investigate the mystery, I thought, \"Noooooooo!\" because by then I wanted to find out what happened to the characters in it. Nothing like reading a story, getting interested in it, and then having it forcibly halted partway through.I do like old journals and stories with journals and journaling. One of the other characters in this book complained that the journal had too much introspection, but no, I enjoy introspection, too - coming to an understanding of ourselves and our relationships with those around us. But, no, the journal did not really seem to dwell on that, either. There were some things that the author didn't want to admit to himself and that he had to come to face, but mostly the journal was about actions, events, his patients, his household, not introspection. I think the complaint was unfounded.I liked the scene where they visited the old dr.'s office and tried to search for the secret quarantine room; I also liked the graveyard scene and how those two scenes linked the present with the past. Very well done. I wouldn't of thought of doing that. I also liked the gratitude spoken at the graveyard. Very fitting. I wish I could stop and think to be more grateful of the people in my own life, while they are yet living.The present-day sick room scene and confession were well done, too. I can relate to that character's associating the feeling of peace with God. That's how I generally think of feeling God's presence, as a feeling of peace. I know that He has other attributes, too, and that just because we believe doesn't mean we will always feel at peace, but whenever I feel His unexplainable and sometimes surprising peace, I know that He's near. Whenever I first became a Christian, I felt His overwhelming peace. I don't think I even really knew what peace was like before then. If someone had asked, I would've said something like \"not arguing,\" or \"getting along,\" not realizing how much deeper and richer, soul-deep, peace can be.Sometimes His peace is given to us as a gift, and other times, we have to pursue it. Psalm 34:14b, \"Seek peace, and pursue it,\" became a key verse for me after the death of an infant many years ago.My one complaint of the book is that in coming to God, there is more than just a feeling. There is an understanding, and a yielding. Jan Karon has explained in the other books in various places better what Jesus has done for us. This was left vacant, and wouldn't really be very understandable to those who aren't aware ... of course, if they aren't aware, they might not have gotten this far in the series, either.Still, I'd like to clarify exactly what Jesus did for us, to enable us to come to God. \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. - Romans 3:23-24, NIV\"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" - Romans 6:23, NIV\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\" - Romans 5:8, NIVSome of my favorite quotes from \"In the Company of Others\"\"He went like the rain, among the just and unjust, doing all the good he could.\" - Charles Dickens in \"Little Dorrit\"\"Really listening to someone is a very tender and generous gift.\"\"Where Christ is cheerfulness will keep breaking in.\" - Dorothy Sayers\"You love his books.\"\"Maybe because I loved him.\"\"He'd taken a degree of his own in the woods and fields.\"\"Everywhere I have sought rest and not found it, except sitting in a corner by myself with a book.\" - Thomas a Kempis (This quote reminds me of someone I know.)\"Wounded people use a lot of smoke and mirrors, they thrust the bitterness and rage out there like a shield. Then, it becomes their banner, and finally, their weapon.\" (I know someone like this, too.)\"What happened to change things?\"\"My oul' mother prayed for me, and m' grandmother, to boot.\""}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1532721-abby", "userReview": "Started this a few years ago and gave up because I didn't enjoy the first chapter. This time, I hung in there and loved the rest of the book. Jan Karon is such a talented writer. The other thing I thought I wouldn't like about this book was that a fair chunk of it is taken up with a historical diary. Always feels like a copout, a convenient way for an author to draw parallels etc. But I ended up getting very attached to the historical story as well as the present day one. Really looking forward to reading Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good, which I got for Christmas!!"}], "description": "A stirring page-turner from the bestselling author of the Mitford Series.   Jan Karon's new series, launched with her New York Times bestselling Home to Holly Springs, thrilled legions of Mitford devotees, and also attracted a whole new set of readers. \"Lovely,\" said USA Today. \"Rejoice!\" said The Washington Post.  In this second novel, Father Tim and Cynthia arrive in the west of Ireland, intent on researching his Kavanagh ancestry from the comfort of a charming fishing lodge. The charm, however, is broken entirely when Cynthia startles a burglar and sprains her already-injured ankle. Then a cherished and valuable painting is stolen from the lodge owners, and Cynthia's pain pales in comparison to the wound at the center of this bitterly estranged Irish family. In the Company of Others is a moving testament to the desperate struggle to hide the truth at any cost and the powerful need to confess. Of all her winning novels, Jan Karon says this \"dark-haired child\" is her favorite-a sentiment readers everywhere are certain to share.", "title": "In the Company of Others\n      \n          (Mitford Years #11)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7932176-in-the-company-of-others", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400867929l/7932176.jpg", "reviews": 954, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40552.Jan_Karon", "name": "Jan Karon"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Christian Fiction", "Christian", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7932176-in-the-company-of-others", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9462962-in-the-company-of-others", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9666958-in-the-company-of-others", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71776.At_Home_in_Mitford", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112872.A_Light_in_the_Window", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71784.A_New_Song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112874.These_High_Green_Hills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78674.Out_to_Canaan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
