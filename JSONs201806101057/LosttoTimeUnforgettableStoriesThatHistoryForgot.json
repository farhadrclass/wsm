A few chapters are genuinely interesting, even riveting, in their own right. In particular, the chapter about the amazingly devastating Peshtigo fire, an enormous disaster that has been largely forgotten because it happened at the same time as the Great Chicago Fire. Others were somewhat less interesting, and somewhat less obscure.

Each chapter has a different subject beginning with Ziryab the tastemaker Arab in 800s Andalusia and ending with Operation Tiger a secret trial run for the D-Day Normandy Invasion. Some of the people and events were lost to common knowledge because other events had more media coverage or were just lost to time. Two American heroes of the Revolutionary War were forgotten because of the PR value of poetry. Sybil Ludington and Jack Jouett both had longer and more difficult rides than Paul Revere, but they didn't have a Longfellow poem. This book was highly readable, narrative non-fiction and quite interesting. Highly recommended for history fans looking for something more."}, {"userName": "Macayla Fryc", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69285224-macayla-fryc", "userReview": "One of the best randomly spotted library books ever.

As I read this book, I couldn't believe that these stories, people, and legacies are forgotten or overlooked in our modern world, which goes to show that there is more to history than what you are taught or told.The true stories include: The story of Ziryab, a black slave from Arabia, who later was a musician in the Moorish court of Spain, who was perhaps one of the most brilliant musicians of all time. He influenced and invented much of our music theory and instruments, setting the stage for the great composers and symphonies. He also originated the idea of fashion, dressing for the seasons, table manners, dinner courses, and many ideas of personal hygiene. The story of Cahokia, one of the largest cities in the world at the time (800-1000 AD) in the mid-West of America.The story of Joseph Warren, who was THE Leader of the Revolution in the Colonies and perhaps would have been the first president instead of George Washington had he not died in one of the first battles of the Revolutionary War. The story of the forgotten riders of the Revolutionary War, not just Paul Revere, and one was a 16 year old girl, who made an even longer and harder ride than Revere, to gather militia to fight the British. The story of one of the greatest American heroes who helped explore and discover the north pole. The story of America's first subway, built underground in secrecy. The story of one of the biggest forest fires that burned an entire town to nothing and killed 2000 people on the same night of the Great Chicago Fire.Several other stories are also covered that are just as unbelievable forgotten about."}, {"userName": "Keith Parrish", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5674968-keith-parrish", "userReview": "Martin Sandler has written a brief overview of some fascinating stories that deserve (and in most cases have) whole books of their own. For a quick review, this is not a bad collection. Events such as the explosion of the steamboat Sultana and the Peshtigo wildfire are given their own chapters as do individuals such as Joseph Warren and Elisha Kent Kane. Sandler tends to overstate the importance of some of his subjects. Gil Eanes certainly wasn't alone in audacity among Portuguese explorers, Henry Ludington's ride through Connecticut being more important than Paul Revere et al's pushes credibility, and Gustave Whitehead predating the Wright Brothers in flight has been largely debunked. Some of these, such as the first New York underground railway powered by pneumatics were truly unknown to this reader. This is a good brief survey to subjects that can be investigated much further."}, {"userName": "Joel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9058325-joel", "userReview": "I have a soft spot for the \"stories your history book never told you!!!\" genre of pop-history books. This isn't really one of the best of its kind, and some of the stories in it circulate frequently through similar books (the story of Gustave Whitehead, for instance, I've read about many times); but it's still an interesting and informative light read. I have to say, though: the author seems awfully credulous regarding Ziryab, an ex-slave in 9th-century Moorish Spain. Apparently basing his account almost entirely on one Arabic historian who wrote 800 years after the fact, Sandler makes Ziryab out to be an unparalleled innovative genius in every area of human culture, from music to fashion to cooking to hygiene. Maybe some of that's even true; but, on the whole, it set off my mental alarm bells."}, {"userName": "Leslie Goddard", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27686344-leslie-goddard", "userReview": "Great writing and some fascinating stories that are largely forgotten today. Entertaining to read. Having these stories told together sparks some interesting thinking about why we remember certain events and how history gets written. That ultimately is what makes this book so disappointing. There is little to no effort to seriously grapple with the historiography all questions the book obviously raises. We never really learn why the author chose these particular stories, other than he just heard about them and thought they were cool. A few chapters end with the barest mention of why this story has been forgotten. I would have loved for someone to help me understand just how much is at stake in the writing and remembering of history. This books promises a lot but delivers only a little."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1690457-nancy", "userReview": "The \"Firsts\" we think we know may not be the actual \"first\". Some of the stories I knew about, but in others I found myself repeatedly saying \"No kidding!\" \"Gil Eanes: Conquering the Point of No Return\" is about the first man to sail past what was considered at the time (1434) the point of no return--the place where monsters were bound to get you if you didn't sail off the end of the earth. \"Elisha Kent Kane: America's Greatest Hero\" went looking for the Northwest Passage. \"America's First Subway: Secrets Under Broadway (1870)\" is the story about how Alfred Ely Beach made an end run around Boss Tweed in New York in order to get permission for an underground tunnel.

Sandler has collected 11 chapters of rare events and little-known individuals who have contributed to history and I'll add the Epilogue (since Sandler didn't). It seems that we are very bad at reading History; we remember only the celebrity cause-agents and their publicists. My favorite chapters included learning about Cahokia, Kane, General Jos.

His writing style moves the narrative along while providing the notes, bibliography, and indexing that a researcher appreciates. In this book, he takes 11 stories from history that have been mostly forgotten. The tales range from a slave who changed history in the 9th century to a female messenger during the American Revolution to Exercise Tiger, a practice session for the D-Day landing in Normandy.

It has a bunch of interesting tidbits, but he research in many cases seems rather cursory. More delving into source material would have added depth to some of the stories but evidently that was not the intent. The general idea of showing how history often edits out many significant events (as well as almost all the nuance nd detail of everyday life) is well made out in these stories, and is presented in an easy-to-read and entertaining format."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2295231-janet", "userReview": "It never fails to amaze me how much one\u2019s take on history is affected by those you listen to.
