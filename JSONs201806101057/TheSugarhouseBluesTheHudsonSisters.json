A freak storm has damaged the ceiling, which is an art form in itself, creating new challenges, financial and creative. Des Hudson, the sister charged with managing the project funding, must look for ways to cost effectively resolve the dilemma and, in her pursuit, finds more than she thought she was seeking, including personal insights and revelations. Des has the loudest narrative but she\u2019s not the only voice in the story. Cara is well on her way to possibly making Hidden Falls her new home as her relationship with the contractor, Joe Damanski, deepens. Allie continues to struggle with her alcohol dependency and developing relationship with Des, which fractured when they were teens. But it\u2019s Des who blossoms as she faces her past head on, embraces her new family and reconsiders having Seth MacLeod stay in the friend zone. That man turned out to be more than what met the eye. This isn\u2019t a story with lots of action and drama, just a slow moving journey through a small-town community with all the upsides at center stage. The sisters are finding their way to creating a family experience they\u2019ve never had and the transformations aren\u2019t rushed. There\u2019s an authenticity surrounding the characters and the story and it\u2019s not one you speed through. I loved putting the book down after a particularly insightful passage, just to ponder the message, and resuming later when I wanted a slice of this life again. I really liked the story and I\u2019ve come to really like the sisters, even the complex and sometimes insensitive Allie. I\u2019m looking forward to her voice in the next story, which was perfectly set up here.

Picking up a new women\u2019s fiction story is a perfect way to set the mood.Mariah Stewart has written so many books that you almost don\u2019t know where to start. However, she is bringing us a brand new series called The Hudson Sisters and it is a interesting delightful look at an estranged family forced together under interesting circumstances.The author showcases each character with their own special quirks and talents. She is wonderful at blending these into the story and making it come to life.With the sisters focusd on re-creating a legacy in their hometown, we are also treated to a little hints of romance sprinkled the along way. Just enough to make it interesting and a beautiful story.A solid writer with so much talent, Mariah Stewart crafts wonderful stories that take us away to small-town America and build strong families we wish we were a part of.* advance copy for review considerationfull review - http://amidlifewife.com/the-sugarhous..."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14045562-amy", "userReview": "Last year I read The Last Chance Matinee and was totally captivated by the Hudson sisters and the authors inspiration for the books. The first time around you meet all three of the sisters but it was really Cara\u2019s story and this time around it\u2019s Des turn. It\u2019s not completely necessary to read the first book, but you would be more familiar with the characters and their histories if you started at the beginning.Des is a character that I warmed to quickly the first book so I was excited to learn more about her this time around. She\u2019s a huge animal lover, she runs a shelter back home in Montana so if you\u2019re a dog lover there are some sweet moments with some pups here. The girls Aunt Barney is my absolute favorite, she\u2019s a sassy gal, full of wisdom and charm, just the sort of matriarch you imagine when you think of a mature woman with a heart of gold.The family is still trying to restore the old theater and it\u2019s not an easy process, especially as they\u2019re running out of funds. I love that this has such a realistic plot, there are no heroic rescues or unbelievable saviors, they face the same issues anyone of us would come up against. The romantic aspect is also true to real life, relationships evolve at a reasonable pace, no one falls in love at first sight, no Prince Charming, but it is sweet and fun still.There are still some family secrets and mysteries to be solved although Stewart does answer a few questions she leaves a few things hanging, a surefire way to keep me continuing with this series. This is a well written, smooth novel, ideal for a summer read, more depth than a beach read but with all of the fun!Sugarhouse Blues in three words: Charming, Authentic and Captivating."}, {"userName": "Kris - My Novelesque Life", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6275022-kris---my-novelesque-life", "userReview": "THE SUGARHOUSE BLUES (The Hudson Sisters: #2) Written by Mariah StewartMAY 15, 2018; 400 Pages (Gallery Books)Genre: contemporary, small towns, family drama, romance\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b(I received an ARC from the PUBLISHER via NETGALLEY\u200b)\u200bRATING: 4 STARSI have been waiting for over a year for the second book in the Hudson Sisters series. The Sugarhouse Blues did not disappoint. One thing I really enjoyed about this novel was that it had characters in the past and future books. This book was Des and Seth's story, but we get more about Allie, Des and Allie's relationship, Fritz and Barney's past. It really makes the town and series come to life. It also makes me remember the characters and story for when the next book comes out. I was nervous starting this one, afraid I would have forgotten details from the first book. As soon as I got to chapter 2, I remembered it all, and enjoyed the continuing story of remodelling the Sugarhouse. Des is one of my favourite characters and I enjoyed the sweet romance between her and Seth, the mayor. Seth is the bad boy on the outside with the heart of a nice guy. Des is a bit standoffish and looking for a stable man. She doesn't think Seth is that guy. Seth proves her wrong as the two work on the theatre and rescue dogs. The novel also sets up book three with Allie and Ben's tension (and chemistry) and how Allie is spiralling into alcoholism. I would recommend reading these books in order as the story continues to the next books.For more on the book please visit my blog My Novelesque Life"}, {"userName": "Chris Conley", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7209420-chris-conley", "userReview": "I love this series.

The Sugarhouse Blues did not disappoint! It was told mostly by Des, but there was still a lot of input from Cara and Allie as well. I love this group of girls and felt like I was one of the sisters while reading! This novel wasn't suspenseful and it wasn't filled to the brim with romance, but it had a constant steady pace that matched the tone of the slow moving small town vibe. It was such an enjoyable read filled with interesting and entertaining characters. I honestly felt like I wanted to move to Hidden Falls by the end of this novel!

Publishing Date May 15, 2018I would like to thank NetGalley and Gallery Books for an ARC of \u201cThe Sugarhouse Blues\u201d by Mariah Stewart for my honest review. The genres for this book are Fiction and Women\u2019s Fiction. This is the second book in \u201cA Hudson Series Novel\u201d, but it can be read as a standalone. The timeline of the story is mostly in the present but goes to the past when it pertains to the characters or events.The author describes the characters in the story as complex, complicated and dysfunctional. Three sisters, Alex, Des and Cara, each have their own problems and motivations for working together to restore their deceased father\u2019s prized theatre , for the inheritance. The sisters see lies, betrayals, and deep secrets that were buried with their father. To renovate this theatre, Fritz, the father had left money. Unfortunately with unexpected leaks, and rising costs of construction, there might not be enough money to finish this project, unless the sister\u2019s can find a way together.The author discusses the importance of love, loyalty, friendship, forgiveness , communication and understanding. Can this project succeed? Will the sisters be able to set aside their differences and work together?This was an easy read, and I regretted that it ended very abruptly. There are many more questions that have to be answered. I eagerly await the next novel.

This one focuses more on the middle sister, Des, but still manages to further the story of all three sisters. Difficult issues are addressed in the story without dwelling too heavily on those issues. While there are romantic elements to the story, the focus is not truly a romance.

Long story short, 3 women discovered they shared the same father, but only discovered this after he died. 2 of the women, Des and Allie, shared a superstar mother and grew up together (dad was a Hollywood agent) and then Cara lived on the other side of the country.

All opinions expressed in this review are my own and given freely**If you read the first book in this series, The Last Chance Matinee, you may know already that this book isn\u2019t going to end with a neat bow tied around it and everything resolved. The Hudson Sisters series is almost like a saga. The first book was mostly about Cara, but the reader gets a lot of back story and also learns a lot about sisters Des and Allie. Well, this story mostly focuses on Des with more pieces of Allie\u2019s story getting filled in. Although, I have to say, this one is much more focused on the one sister than the first book was.I have to preface the remainder of this review by saying that I think the book should only be read if you have read The Last Chance Matinee. I have read a few reviews of those that haven\u2019t read the first book and still enjoyed this story. But since I know the depth and idiosyncrasies of the relationships involved that you\u2019ll be missing if you skip ahead to this one, I strongly urge you to read these books in order.Des was my favorite of the sisters from the very beginning. I can\u2019t tell you exactly why. Maybe because I can relate to the misunderstood middle child\u2026even though she had no idea she was a middle child until recently. I also quickly fell in love with Seth from the first book so it was wonderful to follow the path Des and Seth take to finding what they really want. You can\u2019t help but to root for these two. And honestly, is there anything Seth can\u2019t do? Mayor, veteran, farmer, photographer, etc., etc. He\u2019s truly a jack of all trades!Although this story is mostly about Des, I can\u2019t help but be intrigued by Allie. I by turns loathe her and want to give her a hug. The chip on the woman\u2019s shoulder is bigger than the sun. I am chomping at the bit wondering what went down between her and Ben on the 4th of July and cannot wait to read the next story, which I\u2019m sure will focus more on her. The other plus to Allie is her daughter. Nikki is so much fun and the way her mom feels about her helps to humanize Allie.This book was a bit slower for me than the first book, but it was still amazing. I can\u2019t help but think the first book was more rounded since, of course, the author had to give us more info on everyone to set the groundwork. I only hope the next book is either not the last book, or it\u2019s a bit longer to give us a true ending to the Cara/Joe and Des/Seth stories. While I understand why these individual books are not neatly wrapped up at the end, I hope for the series to be wrapped up to the extent there are no danglers left over.https://allingoodtimeblog.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Kathy ", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8254902-kathy", "userReview": "I received this book from NetGalley to read and review. It is the second book in the Hudson Sisters series. I had requested the first book last year but was not lucky enough to get it. Thus, I sort of came into the story \u201cin medias res\u201d. After trying to read and understand this book, I can only say that you need to have read the first one to really understand and enjoy this one. It really is not a good stand-alone book, though, for some, I guess it can be read as one, if you do not mind being confused and/or in the dark as you read.In this book, the three Hudson sisters are working to restore the old Art Deco theater in Hidden Falls, Pennsylvania. They are restoring the theater as a requirement to inherit their father\u2019s estate. The theater has been closed and is both boarded up and run down, so there is a lot of work to do. The sisters must also live in their father\u2019s family home while restoring the theater and cannot leave. If anyone leaves, the estate will be donated to charity. Since each sister needs the money, they are all reluctant to leave it behind. Thus, they are involved in the joint effort to restore the theater and to live together in the home\u2013along with another well-kept secret, his sister Barney, who lives in the home. Barney, for her part, is kind, loving and generous welcoming the sisters with open arms. The story follows the sisters as they work together, with Barney, to restore the theater, ever short of needed restoration money and ever facing obstacles to the restoration. The sisters and Barney also each have their own idiosyncrasies and secrets, which play out as the story and restoration proceeds through thick and thin, good and bad.The book was interesting but a bit confusing to me. The author portrayed the sisters and their aunt well, but so much had been covered in the first book, with little back story in this one, that I had difficulty figuring out who was who and what was what, and still keep up with and enjoy the story. I definitely would advise any reader to read the first book before this one, to better understand, appreciate and enjoy this one. As I said, I got this one from NetGalley to read and review but had not read the first. I will now go to get it from the library, and, after reading that one will try this one again.

The three sisters have been working together to restore a piece of their family's history while also getting to know each other and the truth about their father's past. The Sugarhouse Blues dives deeper into their family history while also expanding the connection the sisters have with the community.The story picks up quickly from where readers were left in The Last Chance Matinee. Work on the theater is progressing, but Des realizes that more money will be needed to properly complete the project and save them from unexpected issues. While all the sisters play major roles in the book, this story singles out Des to explore her thoughts on the project and whether she'd be willing to leave her old life behind for a permanent stay in Hidden Falls. I really enjoy the way the story flows because it's not just about the Hudson sisters honoring their father's will. Mariah Stewart digs deep into the hearts of these characters to make them vulnerable and rise to the occasion despite their fears and past disappointments. They're so real you can feel their hurt and the joys that come from finding something, or someone, that helps them heal.I've enjoyed these first two stories so far, but I honestly think the next one will be the best. Allie's been somewhat in the background as Cara and Des find their rhythm in town and draw closer to their aunt Barney, but she seems like someone with a problem that's more serious than not knowing what her future holds, or whether she can find a better man than her ex. So far she's hidden behind a mask and hasn't really connected with other people like her sisters have.

Their father left them an old movie theatre, they have to restore the theatre before they can have their inheritance. The intention seems to be that he wanted the girls to spend time together and with the aunt they never knew.Book one focused on Cara, a very likable character.But I might be partial to Des because she\u2019s the animal lover of the group.The sisters are all living Hidden Falls while restoring the theatre. For Des, it is hardest to be away from her shelter.But soon she is helping the local animals too.She\u2019s also falling for a guy that doesn\u2019t seem like her type but he\u2019s always the one she calls when she needs help. After trusting him with the care of two rescue dogs, she starts to realize her feelings.A bit of progress is made on the theatre but more progress is made between the sisters. Des and Allie finally discuss the drama that\u2019s been there for years.I enjoyed this book but I did like the first book better. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to be the middle book in a series, it\u2019s not beginning the story and it\u2019s not closing it. It\u2019s building up some progression but it\u2019s rarely by favorite in a series. Although I\u2019m assuming book three will exist and it will be about my least favorite sister Allie, I imagine it will be the one to wrap the story up neatly.Assuming there will be a third, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll read it.I got to read an early e book edition from NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Ritter", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33433753-jennifer-ritter", "userReview": "The Sugarhouse Blues is the second novel in Mariah Stewart\u2019s Hudson Sisters series. The first book, The Last Chance Matinee, brought the three sisters to the bucolic town of Hidden Falls, Pennsylvania, in the heart of the Poconos. We learned some of the girls\u2019 backstory, met their dear Aunt Barney and many of the local residents, and began the incredible task of restoring the historic Sugarland Theater. The first book also put a greater focus on Cara, the east coast sister. Cara is a take charge kind of lady and she has taken on the task of overseeing the project along with her new love, contractor Joe Darnowski. In this book, the focus is shifted to younger of the west coast sisters, Des. Des has taken on the task of overseeing the finances. She has a knack for wisely managing money as demonstrated by the way she invested and lived from the monies she earned as a child actress. Des seems to find herself often in the company of Hidden Falls major and organic farmer Seth MacLeod. MacLeod, a military veteran complete with shaved head and tattoos, is a nice guy, but Des professes he just isn\u2019t her type preferring the more Ivy League style of grant writer Greg Weller. That is until she spends time with each, finding that perhaps the mayor is exactly her type.Again, Ms. Stewart has woven a rich tapestry of characters and their stories. The many subplots add to the complex weave with so much occurring simultaneously, just as in reality. I loved this story, these people, and anxiously await the next part of their saga. I do recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55562973-mary", "userReview": "The Hudson sisters were annoyed at the terms of their father\u2019s will, requiring them to come to his hometown and restore the grand old movie theatre originally purchased and operated by his father. Allie, Des, and their half-sister Cara moved in with their aunt Barney, who was delighted to have her long-lost nieces with her. The women had a budget of one million dollars to complete their restoration, and after the roof leak that caused damage to the beautifully painted ceiling, they felt they would never complete their mission. Although this is the second in a series, I was able to pick up the storyline quickly, and I never felt I was missing anything. I loved the way the sisters began to put aside their personal differences and work together on the daunting project called The Sugarhouse. Allie\u2019s bitter divorce and forced separation from her teenaged daughter, Cara\u2019s divorce and the death of her mother, and child actress Des\u2019s self-imposed exile in Montana operating a dog rescue facility all make the Hudson women realistic and likeable characters. Mariah Stewart\u2019s skill at storytelling kept me thoroughly engaged, and now I need to read the first book! My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher, who provided this title in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jeanne Grace", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40336435-jeanne-grace", "userReview": "I received an Advanced Reader Copy from NetGalley for my unbiased opinion of the book. As Cara, Allie and Des work harder at becoming a family with Aunt Barney as referee, things start getting done. After a few setbacks in the reconstruction of the theater things slowly start inching forward. Now starting to realize the million dollars their father left them to kickstart the renovations is disappearing at a fast rate.

Des takes them to the vet to get checked out realizes the town is in desperate need for an animal shelter and should not fall on the police chief to find homes for all the abandoned animals. While getting push back at the town meeting the mayor Seth the bald heavily tattooed man that she cannot decide if she's attracted steps in to back her along with her Aunt Barney who used to run the family-owned bank in town.

However, I enjoyed this second in the Hudson Sisters series, featuring Des, the former child actress. The other two sisters (Cara from book one and Allie to be the lead in book 3) feature prominently, as does their Aunt Barney.As the book opens, the theater the sisters are tasked with restoring through their father's will has sustained major damage during a storm. The sisters struggle to find ways to recover from the damage (and not spend every cent they have set aside to restore the theater).While Des resists through much of the book, it's the town's mayor -- Seth -- that she's really attracted to, rather than her usual preppy types. Des struggles to keep their relationship on a friends-only basis (this highly social,tattoed, motorcycle-riding mayor just doesn't make Des feel safe). By the end of the book the three sisters have gotten closer, which I enjoyed. The ending offers more of a potential HEA for Des (as well as Cara), than having everything locked up tightly...which actually is more realistic for the situation.I look forward to book 3 next spring, and would give this a B."}], "description": "Mariah Stewart's second novel in the Hudson Sisters series...Allie, Des, and Cara, each having her own reasons for wanting a share of their father's estate, meet in the grand Victorian home in which he grew up, only to be greeted by another secret he purposely hid from them: his sister Bonnie. The women reluctantly band together to take on Fritz's challenge, working with a local contractor to begin the renovations financed by an account Fritz had set up for the task. While the restoration appears to go smoothly at first, it soon becomes apparent that the work will be more extensive than originally thought, and Des, elected to handle the money, needs to find ways to stretch out the remaining savings while searching for new sources of funding.As strangers linked only by their DNA try to become a family, the Hudson sisters also try to come to terms with the father they only thought they knew. In the process, each woman discovers her own capacity for understanding, forgiveness, love, and the true meaning of family.", "title": "The Sugarhouse Blues\n      \n          (The Hudson Sisters #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297688-the-sugarhouse-blues", "average": 4.32, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1521363939l/35297688.jpg", "reviews": 80, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/39469.Mariah_Stewart", "name": "Mariah Stewart"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/39469.Mariah_Stewart", "name": "Mariah Stewart"}], "type": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Contemporary", "Womens Fiction", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297465-the-sugarhouse-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35297688-the-sugarhouse-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36101192-the-sugarhouse-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36124511-the-sugarhouse-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/690079.Dead_Certain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2241749.Mercy_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1077626.Dead_Wrong", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194937.Last_Look", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6085394-acts-of-mercy"]}
