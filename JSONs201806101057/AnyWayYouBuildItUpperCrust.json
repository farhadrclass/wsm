Best sequentially, but not necessary.Any Way You Slice It #1 - Wish I could have read these books in order, but it doesn't matter. A well thought out romance with realistic dialog and characters and an interesting, entertaining plot. Any more would be spoilers. This series is more substantial than a lot of this genre.Any Way You Fight It #3 - Second chance at love. Another well written, funny romance with interesting characters and an entertaining plot. I can't say more or it would be spoilers. I enjoyed reading this series.Any Way You Want It #5 - If you enjoy S. Claflin and T. Pedersen, you'll love McDonell, too! It's the first chapter and you're already laughing and rootin' for the good guys. A well written, fun-filled romance, this time with Chloe and Moose. My second story by this author and now I want to read them all. Moose is my favorite male character.Any Way You Build It #6 - A well-written, fun, exciting, clean romance. I had to finish it in two sittings; work, a four-letter word, interrupted me. It was complete, but I believe there's more to the story. This is the first story I've read by this author, but I've got another one ready to go from Amazon. I asked the author if I could review this book.Any Way You Spin It #7 - Another second chance. Another well written, heartwarming romance with interesting characters and a realistic plot. None of these books are repeats, but interesting, fun books on their own, just a piece of a larger picture.Any Way You Like It #8 - Another heartwarming, humorous, intriguing second chance romance in one of my favorite places with some of my favorite characters. This complete series is well written with well developed characters with realistic dialog and no stupid formulas, along with interesting and intriguing storylines. While complete with humor and bad guys, these books are substantial pieces, not fluffy junk. This is my second favorite, which is actually hard to decide on since all the books are favorites! There's also a preview of the book, Something of a Spark."}, {"userName": "Margaret Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21488270-margaret-watkins", "userReview": "This cute romance is a lot of fun. Todd is determined to ride the waves of life, working in his tree house and playing games, but marriage and children have no place in his Peter-Pan lifestyle. However, unlike most playboys, Todd has a wounded soul and is in fact a really nice guy. When Sarah is thrown a lifeline through the death of her aunt, she inherits her home, giving her and her two children a place to live. However, things are still not easy as in order to work Sarah needs childcare, something she cannot afford. As neighbours, Todd and Sarah have everything going for them, except for their personal vows never to get attached to anyone again. Sarah finds that she cannot escape notice in the small town and when disaster strikes, Todd ropes his friends in to give her the assistance she needs. He also cannot escape Sarah\u2019s two young children, and when Zach and Livi latch onto him, Todd finds himself giving more of himself than he ever intended. This book is well written and is part of a series, however in spite of again meeting old friends, this story is a standalone and can be read as such. Although there is passion, the story is basically clean and can be read by most age groups."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35092738-kim", "userReview": "I obtained this free e-book from Amazon and I am voluntarily writing a review.

Sarah returns to claim the home deeded to her by her Aunt. The sexy, sweet, and mysterious neighbor Todd helps Sarah and her kids settle in bringing love and happiness while Todd hides his secret.
