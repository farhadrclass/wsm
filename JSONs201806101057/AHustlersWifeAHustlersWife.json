I just have trouble believing a character that starts out so sweet and smart turns into a conniving woman who lets herself get involved in positions that threaten her future. I know that some will disagree and say that it's the environment she was exposed to, but I feel like she made some piss poor decisions as well.  I was also very annoyed by the amount of spelling and grammatical errors in this book. No professionally released book should make it to print with this many errors in it. It affected the way I was supposed to think about the character, as someone who valued education. This vanity press needs to hire an editor, pronto! The amount of errors in this book actually slowed down the pace of the novel for me. I had to read this for a graduate level class and all I could think was, \"If I turned in this book as an assignment, the best I could hope for is a C.\""}, {"userName": "3Shani  H.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2153961-3shani-h", "userReview": "Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you had all the suspicion in the world but you got so rapped up into something or someone to the point everything you lived for slowly went downhill? a hustler's wife was a friction tale between love and the fast life that comes behind it. a young girl named yarnise(yarni) fell in love with a big time player in harlem named des, yarni and des was chronically oppisite. Yarnise was and young and educated girl of color. She had dreamed of attending college to suceed and overcome her family's trac. Desmon(des) was living in the fast life...money,women,drugs and cars he dropped out of school in the 5th grade put still he became the richest man living on the south side. to know him was to respect himPartially i enjoyed this book 65% of my time reviewing it. because of its appealing and great images and vivid vocabulary. the characters jumped out to me as if i knew them and/or could relate to them. i could picture myself in this book playing the role of Yarnise pure beauty and brains, house on a hill, no children education funds complete and headed to the future but push come to shove would trade that in for pissy hallways and shoot outs every night and life in the projects. Money doesn't by happiness and happiness doesn't buy love. i can see myself walking a yard in her shoes. sometimes things that aren't always good for us is good for us. -(Shani Hayes). i was highly betrothed in this book it wasn't fiction in the centerpiece of my eye it was real life of the streets.Nevertheless, their is a subvision of this book which prominently botherd me. I'm not a fan to the way Yarni was treated as a whole. she gave up her education, her wonderful life and even her relationship with her mother to make Des happy and even though he was a player Yarni was understanding of that and still stood her ground and position as his wife. they got married when Yarni was 17 and Des was in his mid-twenty's. Yarnise was new to the game but Des was true to the game, he ran everything and everyone. later along the line Des was incarcerated and while time passed by he broke up with Yarni over a ciagrette and by this time she had no connections with her family the only one she had was her mother and by his commands she had lost all connections with her and Desmon's mother kicked Yarni out she had no money no friends and by now no pride. she have been betrayed by the love of her live and the only way for her to survive is to sell her body she is now introduced to the game and this is her only was out.This book actually taught me something, everything good doesn't last forever so live everyday like it's your last and never be into someone or something so much that you betray your own mother and in the end you gave up your books for selling your body midnights in new york. the most important body utensil is the one between your eyes(brain.) Nikki Turner made a hit as a novel a Hustler's wife is one of my favortie books it has its Pro's and Con's to it but what don\"t? nothing is perfect everything comes in a package with flaws as well as intutions.Yarnise had it all planned out for her, the house, car school etc. but getting caught up between love and her own personal connections almost cost her, her life. MSG TO ALL MY LADIES .....9 out of 10 males are full of it. and unsurprisenly that 1 thats left is taken my advice is to be independent to the best of your ability. and if you think differently than never but an relationship in front of your dreams that you have put out for and to ubsurbly put your love ones out your life is insane no love is that strongWOMEN OF SOCIETY USE YOUR HEAD STAY WISE."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4859943-lynn", "userReview": "This book was utter crap.

I was very annoyed by all of the mistakes in this book- there are far more in this book than any other I've ever read. I'm not as anal as a lot of people when it comes to that sort of thing and I can usually skip right over any spelling (I love it- I just spelled the word 'spelling wrong! LOL), punctuation, grammar, etc. mistakes but the amount and the extent of the mistakes in this are no joke. There were sentences to the effect of: -----\"She said I won't\" be going with you.----- Um, WHAT? If you can get past the many mistakes I do suggest reading this because the plot and characters are great. I loved what happened with Yarni's friend Cara, made me want to slap her in the face a few times. The twist at the very end with Des and Rico was awesome and actually, there was quite a bit in there that probably doesn't seem realistic to some but to others it most definitely would.

It comes from a \"trifling\" place of mind and it reflects a backwards attitude.

This triple crown production book is my favorite book of all time. This book is so good I can go on and on about it. This book was about a hustler being married to this seemed to be innocent girl. Even though the book has so many things I like about it 3 things stand out to me. The coming up, hood credit and the changes.  The coming up. Imagine a girl with a nice family, quiet with no knowledge of the hood. Being from the suburbs. Then imagine meeting a drug dealer who runs the streets. Well that is what happened in this book. I like that the book had this because this girl went from living life average to living it big. She stood by her man, he wound up buying her houses, cars, jewelry etc... She stayed with money in her pocket. Even when he was in jail she was out selling his drugs making that money, she was bringing home over $1,000 a week. That is what I like about this book. How a innocent suburban girl come up like that being taught almost everything about the hood to be out there making money while her man in jail. That is crazy it makes you think does this stuff really happen! Hood credit! Went from nothing to something. Went from only having a little friends to being known all across the hood. In this book the girl got known. She got respect all around. She was able to sell his drugs for him when he went to jail. If she had a problem his people was there for her. She lost her virginity to him and all. She really was the top bitch in the hood and everybody knew her. She could do what ever she wanted and would not get questioned because people respected her so much. I really liked that about this book because it really showed how someone can really get respect in the hood from dating one person. It really seemed real like it could have really happened. Changes! She went from an innocent girl to a girl behind a hustler. She went from Mrs. goody to selling drugs. She changed through out thee book. As I said before she came up and she got hood credit thats all apart of her changing. I like that she changed because when you first open the book you would think she would be good through out and he would just be the bad influence but it did not go like that. He influenced her to stay in school etc... She took it upon herself to gain respect etc... I would recommend this book to people who like triple crown production books. This book is a great book and is my favorite of all time because some things stand out to me like the hood credit, coming up and her changes."}, {"userName": "Keisha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3975302-keisha", "userReview": "Summary: This book is told from the first person point of view the main character by the name of Yarni who experience an astronomical love with her longtime boyfriend soon to be her husband.

Read there is a Part Two may check it out---glad to have finally read this though it is up there with True to the Game, Flyy Girl, TCWE and BMore Careful as hood instaclassics...getting through them all slowly but surely...ah to read all the books I want/need, calm down Nique one book at a time...."}, {"userName": "Tammy Benton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43094995-tammy-benton", "userReview": "A Hustler's Wife By Nikki Tuner.
