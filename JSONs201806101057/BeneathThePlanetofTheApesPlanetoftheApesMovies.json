It\u2019s the last book of the series, which were movies before. I was sucked into this book very quickly and finished it in two days between reading other books. Packed with heroic action and cheesy romance, the story delivered quickly.\u00a0The plot of the story begins with 6 astronauts that mysteriously crash land on their home planet. Only two of them are left. Apparently they believed that they went through a rip of space and time. They are separated from the beginning of the first movie. Taylor meets a girl he calls Nova, a girl enslaved to the Apes. Years of silence had made them silent. I really enjoyed this portion of this story. It was really outdated in a way, apes obviously couldn't take over the earth now. The writing style is very nice. It\u2019s almost as if the writer was taking down many notes when he watched the movie.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then the story takes a sharp twist. After Taylor and Nova reunited with Brent, the other astronaut, they flee to the Forbidden Zone to evade the Gorilla Army. They discover an underground complex where mutant people way beyond the intellect of themselves were living, hiding. They also worship an atomic bomb named Omega, the end. The one before that was named Alpha. I thought the names were really stupid. Kind of reminds me of Megaton in the game Fall Out. I guess that this means that an atomic bomb was set of before and caused people to turn to apes? I don\u2019t know, I never read the first one. I didn't really like this portion of the story it made it feel unreal. Too commercial almost. If the mutants were so powerful, why didn't they kill of the Apes?\u00a0The ending of the book was a little disappointing, but it worked. The Apes took control again, and caused the heroic Taylor to defiantly set the bomb off. And that\u2019s the end. The last of line of the book really impacted me on how insignificant: In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe, lies a medium-sized star, and one of its satellites, a green and insignificant planet, is now dead. It was really unfortunate that they couldn't overwhelm the Apes the save their lives (no pun intended).\u00a0If the astronauts and Nova managed to do so, I would have given the book a full 6 stars. This book is perfect for all audiences, it has great action to it, the characters are heroic, and it makes you really think if this could really happen. The author\u2019s way of writing didn't bother me. It was pretty realistic."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15933391-sharon", "userReview": "Not proud of this one.

This is not a three star book. I have a huge nostalgia bias going on here.Michael Avallone, by any of his 15+ pen names, is not really a three star author. I mean, may he rest in peace and kudos to him for working pretty damn steady as a writer cranking out a steady stream of books, but the guy was no Shakespeare or Steinbeck. He was more like Dan Brown. No, wait...he actually wrote better than Dan Brown. But the guy churned out a series of mysteries built around The Partirdge Family, of all things. (Yes, I'm serious. I'll wait here while you fact check me on that.) And they were hilariously bad and hilariously entertaining, although I don't think they were supposed to be hilarious at all. Anyway, that's what we're dealing with here. He wrote a lot, but he wrote a lot of novelizations of TV/Flim, and he wrote a lot of very simplistic spy stuff. He wrote whatever was going to pay the rent that month. Can't blame a guy for that (long as he sticks to fiction.) Ages ago, during a particularly bad winter where I seemed to spend more time home sick and doped up on children's nasty-ass cherry-flavored cough medicine than in school, I went through a Planet of the Apes and Jules Verne phase. I remember this being hugely entertaining if not particularly well-written. Or maybe it was the codeine that made me think so"}, {"userName": "Yani Garc\u00eca", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30899437-yani-garc-a", "userReview": "It was good and entertaining but also very -what the heck?-.

Adapted from Paul Dehn\u2019s screenplay, the story follows ANSA astronaut John Brent who\u2019s sent to find Taylor and his crew after their ship was lost, and ends up slipping through the same time disturbance and crashing on the future Earth ruled by apes; but unknown to him a war is brewing as the apes prepare to invade the Forbidden Zone where an unknown enemy awaits. Unfortunately author Michael Avallone\u2019s writing style is rather poor, using a lot of needless, elaborate language and choosing some odd narrative techniques. Additionally, he compounds \u201cThe Negro\u201d problem; using this placeholder from the script as a proper character name. Still, he does capture the macabre, apocalyptic tone of the film and creates rich, vivid imagery. Yet ultimately Beneath the Planet of the Apes is a mediocre adaptation that doesn\u2019t really have a good handle on the material."}, {"userName": "Kevin J.J. Carpenter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31890347-kevin-j-j-carpenter", "userReview": "If you've seen the movie, there's really no reason to read this book. There are about three paragraphs, in total, which don't appear in the movie, and the text itself seems to be adapted from the final film itself, rather than an earlier script\u2014as was the case in \"Jaws 2\". Ergo, if you're looking for an alternate take of the arguably lacklustre sequel\u2014I like it, but others appear not to\u2014then this isn't the book for you. The writing style is also quite jarring at first, the text overflowing with purple, single-sentence, expositional and melodramatic sentiments, although it does grow on you by the end of the book. There is, however, one reason to delve into Avallone's adaption: The legendary Dr. Zaius. \nWhile Maurice Evans is magnetic as the ultra-conservative doctor, the second movie pairs him with the radical gorilla, Ursus, who is hell-bent on war and the destruction of all humans. It feels very much out of character for the sometimes benevolent orangutan, who seemed to empathise with Taylor at times, even struggling with his own consciousness about what to do with this sentient, intelligent being who could topple the pillars of Ape City simply by existing. Dr. Zaius was never the bad guy, he was just doing what he thought was best for his people, so his association with Ursus in the movie seems blasphemous. The book does its best explain this scenario, reforging Dr. Zaius into a sympathetic, damn-near Shakespearean character. He knows Ursus is going to fail\u2014he knows Ursus is likely going to get all of his soldiers killed\u2014he even knows that he himself will die if he follows the Gorillas into battle. But Avallone reveals that Dr Zaius does it all for the sake of unity, even going as far to literally pass on the beacon of hope to Cornelius and Zira, so they might illuminate the dark path of the future, and while this scene was in the movie, it seemed more like a courtesy call, a warning for the two chimpanzees not to fuck up again. In the book, it's much more poignant, and definitely makes the entire short novel a worthwhile read for all Ape lovers."}, {"userName": "Nana Kitteh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20112182-nana-kitteh", "userReview": "Second in Series."}], "description": "\"Can the world exist half-ape and half-human?\" Based upon characters created by Pierre Boulle.
