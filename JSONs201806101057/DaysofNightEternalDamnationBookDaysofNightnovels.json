In other words, it gets the job done, but in the clumsiest way possible.ETERNAL DAMNATION is a decent enough book in and of itself, but it fails as a satisfying capstone to a three-part series. As a general rule, the third part of a trilogy should largely consist of action and payoff, but this book offers surprisingly little of either. What it does offer is lots of filler, lots of introspection, and lots of rehashing events that took place previously in the series.I find the absolute mediocrity of this book inexcusable, considering that the first two books provided adequate foundation for a rollicking conclusion. However, the authors inexplicably jettison everything the story seemed to be building toward, and instead focus on Stella and Eben's sudden defection to the dark side. Book #2 promised us an epic vampire plot of global ramifications. What we actually got was a dozen vamps planning to take over a nursing home. These vamps are dispatched early on by Eben with all the difficulty of clipping a hangnail (Thank God for that handy-dandy super-strength that none of the other vampires seem to know about). Book #2 also attached a great deal of importance to the birth of the baby human/vampire hybrid. In Book #3, though, all the baby does is die--which is only significant in that his death spurs Stella to ally herself against mankind.And that leads me to the thing I disliked most about this book. All the good guys from this series end up either dead or turned into bad guys. Stella and Eben's descent into evil feels like a last minute decision to give the book some much-needed kick, and it really isn't handled very convincingly. It's especially weird to see Eben piling up human corpses so soon after being outraged by his fellow vampires' disregard for human life. At least Stella is given a reason for becoming evil; Eben appears to just be going with the flow, as though he never really had a moral code of his own.Generally speaking, I don't mind when authors corrupt or kill off important characters; I just ask that they do it in a way that adds weight to the story. The way it's done in ETERNAL DAMNATION serves no effective purpose other than to make the book needlessly depressing."}, {"userName": "Charlene", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849940-charlene", "userReview": "Eternal Unrest starts off right after the book Immortal Remains where Eben and Stella Olemaun have a marriage crisis due to the half-vampire Baby Dane. The story was interesting enough but I find that it lagged on quite a bit in the middle. The authors decided to insert quite a lot of new characters into the story and there are tons of times when it goes a certain direction and then just dives off a cliff. For example, the prison scene where a prisoner was eaten by a vampire. He seemed to be an important person by the way the authors described him to be but there really wasn't any significance to him, or the vampire that destroyed him. I thought I missed something in the book, but the prisoner or the vampire was never heard from again. The theme of the book was the prevention of vampires coming into existence. Although they are vampires themselves, Eben and Stella Olemaun, at first, wanted vampires to be known by everyone so that humans will fear them or hunt them down to extinction. After finding out the truth of Operation Red Blooded, Eben and Stella Olemaun switches sides and want an outright war against humans. But ancient Lilith, explains that a war shouldn't happen and that they should revert back into hiding and going back into becoming myths for their own survival.I'm a little sad that Eben and Stella sided with the vampires. I know that they are now vampires themselves, but it's known that Eben and Stella will always help out Barrow whenever they can. This book is the turning point for Eben and Stella becoming full on Vampire and not just Vampires that hunt their own kind. I thought this book was okay because there were a lot of times that I just didn't know what was going on. I guess it's also due to Eben and Stella's confusion about which side they should be in. If that was the premise the authors were heading, then they have done the job."}, {"userName": "William Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1143572-william-thomas", "userReview": "i would guess that jeff marriotte does most of the actual writing within the book, based on previous steve niles publications like criminal macabre and dial m for monster. quick and easy, none of the connotations or metaphor i had expected traveling from the original storyline, and the eben and stella characters have degenerated into completely unlikeable and annoying parodies of their former selves."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1869252-mandy", "userReview": "I finally finished the book with mixed thoughts. It wasn't a bad story but it wasn't a fantastic story either. Eternal Damnation was a journey for Eben and Stella as well as the other characters. In this story, Eben and Stella come to terms with what they are and finally make peace. Some deaths shook their world and made them realize that even though they are vampires, they aren\u2019t invincible."}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11428970-sheri", "userReview": "Great insight into Stella and Eben trying to blend in...
