Family. The author paints a picture of upper class Venetian family life that is full of genuine affection, interest and vitality. Donata, the heroine, is one of 12 children. It is no mean feat for an author to create 12 distinctive child characters in a book as short as this one, but she pulls it off. Donata's respect for her parents and concern for her family's honour is also unexpectedly deep. 2. Rebellion or reform? It seems that the Venetian patriarchal system was a really terrible one. According to this book, typically only one son and one daughter from each noble family was permitted to marry and raise children, so that the family inheritance (split by law between each son) would not be dissipated over the course of generations. This of course contributed to a massive problem with prostitution and illegitimacy. It was easy to sympathise with Donata's many disappointments and her resentments against such an unjust social structure. What surprised me was that while it seemed for part of the book that everything was building towards her chucking a big old tanty and getting as far away from the whole rotten mess as she could (understandable), the resolution took a far less modern, individualistic turn and one that was much more believable and satisfying, to me at least. I don't want to spoil it, but essentially the author took the heroine in a more reformist direction. Since I believe that lawful reform, not revolution, is the Christian way to transform rotten cultures from the inside out, I really appreciated this resolution.3. Women. Finally, I appreciated the author took the opportunity to emphasise (alongside the terrible injustices) the many clever ways that wise women have found to influence and contribute to governance and culture, even in profoundly restrictive societies such as 16th century Venice."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1620156-stephanie", "userReview": "Usually, I do not enjoy Historical Fiction novels, but Daughter of Venice was an exception. The author, Donna Jo Napoli, did a tremendous job explaining the setting and characters, making the plot and characters come to life. I found myself predicting throughout the entire book, there was a lot of action and twists.The story was about a fourteen year old girl, Donata, who lives during the 1590s in Venice. She is a noble daughter, and in noble families only one daughter and son may marry. Although it is improper for Donata to marry, she longs to. Donata, disguised as a boy, escapes from her palazzo to see her home city, Venice. She falls in love with a Jewish man, and what she finds in the streets of Venice changes her life forever.This book kept me questioning until the very end. Everyone should consider reading it, it is definintely one of my favorites."}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101057-meredith", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book more than I did, and wish that I could give a 2.5 star rating instead of 3. The book was hard to get through for a few reasons. The first being that the protagonist, Donata, seemed to waver between a bratty child a and a witty teen. Her character is 14 years old, but her voice often appeared as that of an 11 year old. While the random facts/lessons on Venetian history were interesting, not all of the facts were pertinent(thought interesting) to the telling of Donata's story, and many of these facts were awkwardly placed and contributed to the bumpy reading. Like a previous reviewer stated, I hope that the historical notes presented in the novel are well researched facts. I did like the rich detail of the landscape (smells, sites, etc.), I could actually imagine myself in 1500s Venice. I most enjoyed the chapters that Donata and Noe interacted.*****SPOILER*************I was also bothered by the ending that didn't really resolve Donata's desire to marry contrary to tradition. It was confusing to have her go back and forth between wanting marriage, and not wanting marriage."}, {"userName": "Suzannah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13906136-suzannah", "userReview": "I'd heard good things about this book, and it didn't let me down. Donna Jo Napoli has written a vivid, well-researched coming-of-age story set in Venice in the 1590s. There's a scene in the very first chapter in which our young heroine ventures into a forbidden map room that beautifully evokes a sense of excitement and enchantment; from that moment I knew I was in good hands.But the story also had a lot to recommend it as well. Of course, Napoli was writing from a modern humanist and feminist viewpoint, but she showed a true historian's eager sympathy for her subjects, their faith, and the complexities of their world. She clearly intends to expose the oppression which seems to have characterised so many aspects of life in renaissance Venice, especially the treatment of women, but she is fair enough (and realistic enough) 1) to give her heroine a loving family who value her and are willing to listen to reason; 2) to acknowledge the genuine ability of clever and gifted women at all periods of history to find self-fulfillment and earn recognition for their talents; and 3) to provide her heroine with an ending that may not follow the feminist narrative, but is refreshingly true to the character, the time, and the place.I didn't love it, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it for mature young adults."}, {"userName": "Lauren James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4254869-lauren-james", "userReview": "Another of my favourite books alongside THE THIEF LORD set in Venice, because that\u2019s clearly My Thing, this is a historical novel about a rich girl who sneaks out of her house to flirt with a cute Jewish boy who teaches her to write. I got this out of the library about three times when I was fourteen.This is set in Venice in 1592, where Donata is a noble girl stifled by convention, who dresses as a boy to explore the city.

I can't tell if I grew up or if this was just an off book, but I could tell where this was going the whole time. I do want to give her props for not resolving the romance the way she could, and in fact backgrounding it as much as she could.

It's about a young girl, Donata, who I trying to become more than what women of her station are due in the 1500's. It's an enlightening look into a world that most people don't think of.

(I got them together at the library, recommended by my sis.) But after reading deep into it, I realized it was as intense and sad as Red Necklace was. It's a story of a young noble girl named Donata living in Venice a long time ago. It's a custom that only the oldest daughter of the family gets the privilege to marry, but Laura (Donata's twin) and Donata's only dream is to marry just like Andriana (the oldest). News comes from their father that both Donata and Laura will be shut up in a convent together, which is custom for younger daughters. Donata realizes she has never seen her city of Venice, and she pledges to know her city before she is shut away. She begins the perilous journey to disguise as a poor fisher boy and explore with the help of her sisters. This leads to betrayal of her mother's trust, marriage confusion, and the loss of her noble reputation. This book is not only very interesting to read, it is also very educational because I have never known anything about ancient Venice.

She escapes and goes into a Jewish neighborhood, where she learns how to write and is educated. Coming from a family of over 7 children, Donata has a twin sister, Laura, that agrees to pretend to be her while she is out. But here's the catch: Only one daughter in each family is likely to be married. And because Donata and Laura have an older sister, they think they are going to be sent off to a convent. But, because Laura took Donata's place and she's the one that is good at playing the violin, Donata is mistakenly betrothed to a man who does not love her, and Laura is sure she's the one going to the convent. However, Donata has fallen in love with the Jewish man who's teaching her and She's trying really hard to win her sister back and fix the mess she's gotten into, without telling everyone her secret.

She is one of many daughters in a noble family in a time when dowries were of great import. Basically all the dowry money is going towards marrying off her older sister so Donata and her female siblings are looking at life in a convent stuck inside looking out all the time. Donata dons the attire of a fisher boy and runs the streets of Venice where she befriends a Jewish man and becomes a scribe. She must find a way to avoid her family's plans for her even if it means scandal and deceit. Very clean YA book. The heroine is very innocent.

I kid you not, it missed by the narrowest of hairs.Still, I stand firmly by my final decision. This beautifully-written old timey Venice-set tale (by the author of the masterpiece known as Dark Shimmer!) is the story of brave Donata who ventures out of her sheltered world to discover the sights -- the pretty and the ugly -- of the Venice she only sees from her windows and from under her veils. On the surface, this book has so many things that just scream \"Lucy March will love this to pieces!\" There's twins, Venice, pretty dresses, excitement, a touch of romance, lovely prose, and one of the singularly most GORGEOUS covers I've ever seen. The family interactions are believable, the history is -- as far as I have been able to find out -- accurate, and its very entertaining. This, in of itself, can make me overlook a number of small issues I might take with it, and YET... It just couldn't get that fifth star nor a place on my favorites list. I can excuse Donata's classic case of rebellious princess syndrome (the author at least does something interesting with it), I can excuse the fact that the (main?) couple never got together (it's bittersweet, and realistic, and lets face it -- as much as any romantic-minded reader would love to think Noe would love Donata back, there's no in book proof, and he DID think of her as a boy for pretty much the entire time we knew her; they're friends but that's as far as it's ever going), but the overly neat way everything else got wrapped up in the last couple of chapters? Meh. Donata gets off scott-free? Her (rather demented) desperate plan works with remarkably little backfiring, and she basically just gets everything she ever wanted except for Noe? Really?Also, the tone of the book felt off to me. It seemed to falter between middle grade style and YA. Not to mention, the author -- allegedly still through the eyes of Donata -- would just spew out endless Venice history lessons from time to time. They were interesting but kind of clunky and out of place. That said, I liked the characters and setting, and I'm really glad to have read this. Not quite as well done as Dark Shimmer, but definitely worth checking out all the same. An afterthought: I couldn't stop giggling when I read the part where Donata had to be a girl pretending to be a boy pretending to be a girl. I just kept thinking of that high school movies Cracked sketch from youtube;  I'm an undercover black man, posing as a white guy, pretending to be a...

The story takes place in Venice where the main character, Donata lives with her family in the families Palazzo on Venice\u2019s grand canal. The story begins when Donata is with her little sister Paolina in their bed in the morning. The problem arises when Donata realizes that her and her twin sister will both get married since they are twins and normal noble families are only aloud to marry two of their eldest daughters, while Donata\u2019s older sister is already getting married with a man that they have to find that is part of a high noble class family. Donata realizes that she doesn\u2019t like all the things that she has to wear in order to be a lady like teenager in their social class, she has to wear wooden high heals and tight corsets that aren\u2019t comfortable for what she wants to do, her little sister does not need to wear the tighter and prettier clothes. \u201cI look in envy at Paolina\u2019s zoccoli, her sandals with thin wooden bottoms. Paolina is only nine and she hasn\u2019t been subjected to high shoes and tight corsets yet.\u201d (Napoli, 2). Throughout the story, Donata runs away, with her own little plan, in order to see the world that she wants to discover before she gets married and locked away. Donata visits Venice, she discovers another part of Venice that she never knew existed. Lastly, Donata returns home and stays with her family. Donata, is the main character of this novel. She is a very brave, courageous and adventurous person. Donata treats other characters very nicely; she is a very sweet and nice girl at the same time. Throughout this story, Donata grows and matures; she is ready to take her own decisions in life about what she wants to do and how she wants to do it. At the beginning of the story, Donata always wanted to be free and to not have to wear corsets and annoying high heels, Donata kind of accepts the fact that she has to become an adult and a young woman at the end of the story. From the actions of the main character, the reader learns that Donata would be ready to do anything for her freedom. All of this made the plot of the story better and more interesting, since Donata ran away from home. The most exiting part in this story is when Donata gets to find out about the whole other part of Venice that she didn\u2019t know about, this is exiting because Donata finds out a whole new world that was at her feet. The most disappointing moment in this story is when Donata has to be forced to do what she doesn\u2019t want to do like going to balls and wearing corsets. I would recommend this story to young adults who like kids that are independent and that they can relate to Donata.

It didn't change my life and I don't think I'll read it again, but I still really loved it. Easy to fall into, easy to enjoy, exactly what I needed at the time. More importantly, it was a satisfying, light read while defying the new norms in literature that celebrate the degradation of heroines and sisterhood. Something I really loved about this book is that it didn't try to change the reality of history. Sure, they created an unlikely young girl who sometimes said things inappropriate for her age and time in history, but in the important thing--the romance--they didn't alter history. Fact is, even if she fell in love with a Jew and he with her, at that time and age that just wouldn't have worked out. The author didn't do gymnastics to give the reader the gratifying, easy ending that so many authors opt for these days. She didn't cheapen the book by having an independent, willful young girl who defys norms, meets a man, falls in love with him, does not get along with her sisters or other female companions, and then somehow ends up happy with the man, still without female friends, and doing whatever it is she wanted to. I really like that Donata found happiness at the end without a man, without romantic love of any kind, but with her sisters as companions, and still fitting in with society, albeit somewhat unusually. It bothers me how often books will end with romantic happiness = happiness when the hero is a female. This book didn't do that. It has a wonderful, great ending that will make you feel happy, without the frankly sexist ending I've come to expect, particularly from YA authors. And I love how her true passion was learning and teaching. Donata's hunger drives the book, and it kept me enthralled. I also loved how the siblings, particularly the girls, bonded together. Too much, women are encouraged to not stick together, to not band as one and be a wall of strength when one individual is lacking their confidence. No so here. These girls were with each other in spirit and body. They loved and respected and cherished their brothers, but I love how the girls were a team. I also loved her younger brother (Boroto?)--he was my favorite. Destroying the magic hat! So cute, so wonderful! Go Donna Jo Napoli. I'm definitely going to read other books of yours now.

She has 4 sisters and 7 brothers. She has very strict parents and they have high expectations from her. Donata's sisters convince her to leave the palazzo by dressing up as a poor boy so she can explore.  There are some parts I though the author could improve on making more events happen in the beginning of the book, because the beginning of the story was boring and there was hardly any action. The author made Donata a very bold character who goes against her parents wishes. This makes Donata a very round character because she changes into a very mature girl who thinks she is ready for life outside of the palazzo. This character development is indirect.  The theme in Daughter of Venice is that you can change your life into anything that you would like it to be. This is revealed by Donata going out to explore the city and in the end of the book, she gets to learn and study at college even though that is not what her family planned for her. This theme is very familiar and can be found in other books. The plot is primary to style,character and setting because in order for a good story, you need all of those different elements to combine and work together to create the story. There is no sub-plot.  Dialogue is very effective in this story. Donata had a lot of conversation with her sisters while helping her plan the sneak out, and Donata meets and interacts with some new people while on her journey of exploring Venice. The setting of this story Is in Venice, Italy. It does play a significant role because the book does have some history in it about Italy. The setting impinges on Donata because she is part of one of the highest noble families in Venice so she has many rules especially since she is the oldest daughter."}, {"userName": "Pavit", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33327822-pavit", "userReview": "I didn't expect to love this book the way I did.\nComing from a Third World country, I understand the helplessness that overwhelms the main character, Donata, because of the constraints society put on her for having the terrible misfortune of being born with breasts and a vagina. I get how trapped and frustrated you can feel when opportunities that your brothers take for granted are denied to you, when you don't know the nooks and corners of your beloved city, when you see men all around you talk about all the wonderful things that you will never get to see, touch or feel. But I digress, this is a book review and so, I shall review Daughter of Venice: Donata, a female protagonist, remains just that, a woman; feminine in nature despite the dangers she undertakes, despite the dreams she carves on the underside of her eyelids. She doesn't become a superhuman with extra strength and bravado that may seem nice to read but is not realistic. She fears and she gets beaten down. Another thing I really liked about the book was the description. Donna Jo Napoli has done a commendable job at giving readers a feel of the hopelessness and frustration that Donata feels, a feel of the city she holds so dear and the people surrounding her. She has done all that, without making me want to skip paragraphs to get to the dialogues which I am guilty of doing all the time. However, the best thing about the book was that it wasn't a love story, no matter how much my mundane heart wanted it to be. It was a story solely focused on giving Donata the rights and the freedom she deserved and that she could acquire happiness all on her own, without the help of a man's love. To conclude, I will say that Donna has written to the best of her abilities without overdoing it to give you a character to love, a story to remember and a lesson to behold for the rest of your life."}, {"userName": "MyGoodBookshelf", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8714301-mygoodbookshelf", "userReview": "(This review also appears on Amazon.co.uk)This is the captivating tale of bold, brash noblewoman Donata, a teenager desperate to obtain some degree of freedom in 15th Century Venice before she is ultimately shipped away to join a convent by her strictly traditional family.Eager to learn and explore her home city of which she can only imagine through maps, paintings and stories told by her uncles and elder brothers, Donata knows that her future and that of her younger sisters also, is entirely planned out for her and so concocts a plan to briefly escape out into the city. In doing so however, she is quite unaware of the consequences this may bring...A beautiful story of renaissance Venice that is at times humorous, sad and reflective. I feel I learned a lot from this story about the status of Venetian families during that time period- so it was informative as well as entertaining--I'm glad I wasn't around back then, the way of life was so strict! I'm also not generally a big reader of historical fiction either which I sometimes find too dry, but this was richly told and proved completely absorbing- I may even give some other historical fiction a try now! You can tell that the author's research into politics, culture and religion of the time period was impeccable and through it Venice is really brought to life.The elegant prose and detail meant that I became engrossed in this novel from the outset. The pretty cover seduced me alone. I can highly recommend it for an `anytime' read, and if you are as hesitant to approach the genre as I initially was, then you needn't worry as this is a truly wonderful tale.**If you like this novel then I can also definitely recommend `The Glassblower of Murano' which is another book with a Venetian setting that successfully transported me to another time.**"}], "description": "In 1592, Donata is a noble girl living in a palazzo on the Grand Canal. Girls of her class receive no education and rarely leave the palazzo. In a noble family, only one daughter and one son will be allowed to marry; Donata, like all younger daughters, will be sent to a convent. Donata longs to be tutored like her brothers and to see the Venice she has glimpsed only on the map. What is the world beyond her balcony, beyond what she sees when she glides, veiled, in a gondola down the canal? She dresses as a boy and escapes the palazzo on the Grand Canal to see the world before she is shut away, and to try to find a way to escape her fate. Donata risks everything; she changes her life, and her family\u2019s life, forever when she walks through the door and encounters a Venice she never knew existed.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Daughter of Venice", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/668730.Daughter_of_Venice", "average": 3.7, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320460290l/668730.jpg", "reviews": 188, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18684.Donna_Jo_Napoli", "name": "Donna Jo Napoli"}], "type": ["Historical", "Young Adult", "Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/668730.Daughter_of_Venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1182821.Daughter_of_Venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7156713-daughter-of-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3132387-daughter-of-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/798541.Daughter_Of_Venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54356.Zel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81130.Beast", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219677.Sirena", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81131.Bound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/765584.Hush"]}
