Now THIS was a damn great book.

The Kind Worth Killing is a smart, well-crafted psychological thriller. Fans of Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train should be all over this novel (but I thought Kind/Killing was much better than the bestselling-but-forgettable Girl/Train).The story opens with a man and woman, Ted and Lily, chatting in an airport lounge. Ted is upset because he recently found out his wife, Miranda, is cheating on him. Lily encourages him to talk, and says she'll help him kill his wife. Ted agrees, in part because he's attracted to Lily. The chapters alternate in their points of view, so we see the story unfold from both Ted and Lily's perspective.The plot starts out simple, but things quickly get more complicated. (Murder is hard, you guys!) There are several juicy turns, but I am being vague on details so I don't spoil anything for my fellow readers.The alternating-chapters technique has been crazy popular in recent years, and it works well in this book. I especially enjoyed Lily's story. It turns out she has some experience with making people disappear, but she always has a good reason: \"Truthfully, I don't think murder is necessarily as bad as people make it out to be. Everyone dies. What difference does it make if a few bad apples get pushed along a little sooner than God intended? And your wife, for example, seems like the kind worth killing.\"BOOM! We have a title.I was so absorbed in this book that I stayed up late to read it, then I got up early, and then I considered calling in sick just so I could see how it ended. I liked all the twists in the plot, and hope Peter Swanson will craft more good thrillers.Meanwhile, I'm going to be careful who I talk to in airport lounges.Favorite Sociopathic Quote\"We understood that survival was everything. It was the meaning of life. And to take another life was, in many ways, the greatest expression of what it meant to be alive.\""}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201dTruthfully, I don\u2019t think murder is necessarily as bad as people make it out to be. Everyone dies. What difference does it make if a few bad apples get pushed along a little sooner than God intended? And your wife, for example, seems like the kind worth killing.\u201dWe are brought up to believe that murdering someone is the worst thing we could ever do, but is it? If a person is leaving a wide wake of broken hearts and battered spirits and in some cases much, much worse, is it really the worst thing we can do for all of humanity to give that person a nudge towards the afterlife? Of course the question remains, are any of us capable by ourselves of being the defense, the jury, the prosecution, and ultimately the judge? When Ted Severson sees Brad Daggett, a man he has been paying an abundant amount of money to build his dream house, bend his wife, Miranda, over a table and have consensual sex with her, it sets off a string of events that...leads...to...murder. At the very least Brad should have offered Ted a discount. Okay, so the guy is banging your wife. She signed a prenup. That silly bitch isn\u2019t getting one more thin dime out of you. You just need to go get drunk, maybe call up an old flame and have some unsatisfactory revenge sex, and call your lawyer in the morning. Not Ted. He can drink like a fish, martinis in fact, line them up from here---------------to here, but mostly he just simmers on what he saw. He even tries to convince himself that what he saw wasn\u2019t exactly what he saw. Brad was just trying to...nope... not even after six martinis can he convince himself that Brad was doing anything, but SHAGGING his wife. Ted wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to do until on a plane flight home he met The Lily Kintner. Maybe it is because she is beautiful and receptive to him, or maybe it is just because he has to tell someone and usually a stranger is much easier to spill your guts to than a friend. She doesn\u2019t react the way he expects. In fact, she tells him that his wife sounds like  the kind worth killing.You\u2019d never know to look at her, but Lily is an unusual young woman. She is a woman who doesn\u2019t believe in letting people get away with things like infidelity or lying. She doesn\u2019t believe in turning the other cheek or forgiveness. She realizes there is something missing in her, something different. Her father is a reasonably famous author, and her mother an academic. Their household was a free-for-all of revolving parties with artists, writers, friends, and lovers of both her parents coming and going throughout her whole childhood. She was mostly left to her own devices, and when one young man took an interest in the thirteen year old with the flaming red hair and the long thin legs,...well...he annoyed her. \u201dI\u2019d been waiting for two things since killing Chet. Waiting to get caught and waiting to feel bad. Neither had happened yet, and I knew that neither would.\u201dNow, it may seem like she is just a random stranger with a morbid sense of morality, but as the plot thickens we discover why Lily has taken an interest in Ted\u2019s shattered marriage. The chapters alternate between characters. We are allowed to see things from their perspectives and what is missing in one chapter can be revealed in the next. It all begins to really heat up when police officer Henry Kimball can\u2019t let go of a hunch and begins to follow Lily. He adores her father\u2019s writing, and after interviewing her a couple of times he is half in love with her, but dribs and drabs of loose ends from their conversations continue to nag at his consciousness. 2+2=3.75There is a funny scene that I have to share that made me laugh because it reminded me of myself. Lily\u2019s father has very distinct views of the ocean. \u201dHe said it was like looking at death\u2026. I love the beach, everything except the fucking sand, the fucking sun, and the fucking water.\u201d Okay, it made me chuckle again writing it because it is so sacrosanct for anyone to ever say anything remotely negative about the ocean because everyone is so IN LOVE with water. I enjoy looking at the water. I can understand the attraction, but for me it is something to look at briefly and then move on to something more interesting. I have never really trusted large bodies of water. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m suffering from Thalassophobia, but certainly I don\u2019t feel the need to join the masses in venerating the ocean. I prefer solid terra firma under my feet... all the time... besides the water is such a slurry sludge pit of god knows what. Killers become victims...victims become killers. Yet again Peter Swanson has delivered a neo-noir thriller that reminds me of some of the best of James Cain. There are twists and turns enough to leave your legs corkscrewed together by the time you reach the final page. I also enjoyed his first book.

Peter Swanson takes us on a twisty turn-y action packed thriller that begins with a simple conversation between two strangers at an airport bar. After wealthy, and when I say wealthy I mean absurdly filthy stinking rich, Ted Severson confesses after one too many martinis to a beautiful mystery woman on the bar stool beside him that he caught his wife cheating on him, quickly following with a flippant remark that he wished his wife dead. Ted was surprised that not only did the lovely mystery woman named Lily Kinter, not flinch away with distain but heartedly agreed that he should kill his wife. After all some people are \n the kind worth killing \n. Ted both drunk and a little infatuated with the beguiling Lily soon finds himself in a surreal conversation with this strange woman plotting the murder of his wife. After all she clearly was only using him for his money, he had given her everything his love, time, attention and she had betrayed him and then lied to his face in such a eerily easy manner. He believed his wife to be pure evil and he was doing the world a favour ridding the world of such a selfish human. There it is, the plot. At least I thought it was. I thought well I guess the rest of the story will be the carrying out of the murder, the complications that ensue, the understanding the Lily Kinter's motives and possibly the avoidance of, or incarceration by the police. Oh how foolish I was, I thought I figured this story out and now I was going to enjoy a twisted but predictable tale. My god Peter Swanson played me like a fool. By the 30% mark of this book I was given a literary slap down when everything I thought I figured out swiftly blew up in my face. I wish I can go into more descriptions of this novel but it's impossible without divulging major spoilers, just know that there is much more then meets the eye in this story. This is how you write thrillers people, this how you do red herrings, twisted plots, mass reveals and dark character development. Take notes thriller authors this book has set the bar high. I am so glad I found such a unnerving book. I haven't been surprised in awhile and I forgot how fun and shocking it is to truly be thrown off your guard. Last book that did that to me was Gone Girl and that was quite few years ago. I can see Peter Swanson, like Gillian Flynn, loves those strong female sociopath types and I found myself once again having a girl crush on the morally duplicitous anti-hero. I can't help myself. I know I should frown on their behaviour, condemn their horrific actions but nope I love them and I want them to get everything their twisted heart desires. Thriller fans, this is a must read a tantalizing dark tale that'll have you saying \"what the fuck?\" out loud in your favourite quiet cozy cafe more then once because, well, WHAT THE FUCK! This story is insane.

The morality of an animal\u2014of a crow or a fox or an owl\u2014and not of a normal human being.\nPeter Swanson, author of The Girl with a Clock for a Heart, has a twisted mind, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. He seems to think in curves, bends, dips and sudden, hairpin turns. The feeling is a bit akin to being here, or maybe here. The sudden changes in direction may generate a bit of screaming, but it\u2019s all good.Peter Swanson - from Dead Good Books It starts with a nod to, well, a bit more of a full body embrace of, Strangers on a Train, a 1950 psychological thriller by Patricia Highsmith, in which two men who meet while traveling get to sharing their troubles and decide that permanently eliminating each other\u2019s problems might be the perfect solution. Hitchcock made a beautiful translation of the book to film in 1951. Swanson is a big fan of both Highsmith and Hitchcock.\nI like the idea of sudden change. That you or me or anyone could go out to a bar one evening, and the random stranger who sits down beside you changes your life forever. It\u2019s actually something that Hitchcock liked a lot himself. Most of his protagonists are accidental ones, just ordinary people who wind up in extraordinary circumstances. \n In his version, Ted Severson a wealthy corporate raider (formerly a dot.com millionaire sort), at a Heathrow bar pre-flight, is approached by Lily, a lovely young thing. They strike up a conversation, and, as strangers might be better able to manage than people who actually know each other, (a theory titled The Rules of Airport Bars) they agree to tell each other the whole truth, and continue their truth-telling all the way back to Boston. The truth is gonna hurt\u2026someone. Seems that Ted spotted his wife en flagrante with the contractor who was working with her on Ted\u2019s Maine McMansion. Not good. \n\u201dHow long ago was this?\u201d asked my fellow traveler after I\u2019d told her the story.\u201cJust over a week.\u201dShe blinked her eyes, and bit at her lower lip. Her eyelids were pale as tissue paper.\u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d she asked.It was the question I\u2019d been asking myself all week. \u201cWhat I really want to do is kill her.\u201d I smiled with my gin numbed mouth and attempted a little wink just to give her an opportunity to not believe me, but her face stayed serious. She lifted her reddish eyebrows.\u201d\u201cI think you should.\u201d She said. \nAnd the game is afoot.An earlier title for this book was The Lonely Lives of Murderers, which, personally, I prefer. We are treated to multiple narrators, not all of whom are psycho-killers. These serve not only to bear witness to events from diverse perspectives, but to bring in the back story as well, offering a sliver of understanding about how at least one of the psycho killers might have become that way. This is a considerable stylistic switch from Swanson\u2019s previous book, which was written in the third person. It is, however, entirely consistent with the madcap dashings-about of that earlier work. Detective Rebecca James carries over from The Girl With A Clock for a Heart, but that did not seem a significant connection between the two books.One soft spot of note is that it can sometimes be easy to mistake the voice of one sociopath for another. There could have been more of a tonal difference made between Lily and Miranda\u2019s narration. This is not literature, and makes no bones about it. Swanson considers himself a failed poet, and teases himself a bit in the book by giving Ted an urge to write bawdy limericks. It\u2019s cute. But poetry major or not, he has proven, again, that he can write a wonderful, slick entertainment. No sophomore jinx here. If you are the sort who objects to excessive reliance on the sociopath as a crutch, you may have a point, but then you would probably not be reading this sort of book anyway. Peter Swanson has written a twizzler of a novel, a sweet morsel with surprising and satisfying twists that will, when you are finished, leave you wanting more. It is a gripping read, fun, fast, and furious. The Kind Worth Killing is most definitely a psychological thriller worth reading. You might pick this up at an airport or rail terminal or maybe take it along for a day at the beach. You will be glad you had. But while you are sitting at that bar, killing time in a waiting room, maybe lounging under a palm tree or an oceanfront umbrella, be careful who you talk to and what truths you tell.Review posted \u2013 4/10/15Publication date \u2013 2/3/2015=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author\u2019s Tumblr, Twitter and FB pagesSwanson\u2019s web site has a cornucopia of samples of his Hitchcock poems, other poetry, short fiction and non-fiction, and is well worth checking out.

And your wife, for example, seems like the kind worth killing.\u201d\u2015 Peter Swanson, The Kind Worth KillingThis first-rate domestic thriller has never gotten the attention it deserved. It won a couple of awards when it was released in 2015, but The Girl on the Train was published around the same time and that press junket steamrolled over any serious consideration The Kind Worth Killing was gaining as the go-to novel that year.A modern take on the Patricia Highsmith classic, Strangers on a Train, the story is told mostly through the voice of Lily. I read this over two years ago, and I still remember Lily! She is a terrifyingly, unreliable narrator due to her psychotic tendencies. Here\u2019s the weird part: I started sympathizing with her and hoping she would get away with murder in the end. This is a talented writer, people! To turn readers into serial killer sympathizers, kudos to the skillful Peter Swanson!If I summarize this book, it would be filled with spoilers. You\u2019re most likely familiar with the Highsmith book or the Hitchcock movie, so you already know the plot. It is a cat and mouse game played with the highest stakes. But there is so much more in the way of characterization (especially Lily!) and plot twists and shocks and murder and\u2026MAYHEM! Amen to that.Now is the time to pull THE KIND WORTH KILLING out of your TBR stack. You will be rewarded with lots of creepiness and an unputdownable story."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "Wonderfully twisted and chilling suspense novel that will keep you tuning the pages.Thank you Noeleen for recommending this book as I was having a reading slump and this was just the book to make me sit up and shake of the cobwebs.This Novel grabbed my attention from Page one with its short flowing chapters and its quirky plot which starts with a conversation in an Airport bar between two strangers and leads to some riveting reading.A cast of despicable characters and a plot full of twists and turns really made this book a real page turner.\n I especially loved the ending ."}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "Whoa! I gotta say that some of the twists and turns in this book definitely took me by surprise!!! I must admit near the beginning of THE KIND WORTH KILLING by PETER SWANSON had me feeling a little bit uncomfortable and questioning the motives of our devious, scheming, and manipulative main character, Lily. I just didn't know if I could get passed the planning stages and the idea that it was okay to murder someone and Lily\u2019s dispassionate comment that Miranda, seems like \u201cthe kind worth killing\u201d, hence the title of the novel. Then I reminded myself that hey this is a psychological thriller that is actually very cleverly written!The characters are so well-drawn, captivating, and malicious but yet so intriguing that you can't help to get caught up in their cat and mouse game. The story is told through four different perspectives but Lily's voice is heard the most throughout the story. Even though I found myself questioning her motives, the way she justifies her actions and the interactions she had with the other characters had me rooting for her throughout this twisted and chilling tale. That's good writing!I listened to this on Audible & also followed along with the print copy, just in case I missed something! I really enjoyed the performance by all four narrators.To sum it all up, this is a gripping, suspenseful, enjoyable, and an extremely fascinating novel that left me feeling totally satisfied.

So, because that's abnormal for me and because I think this book deserves better, I'm going to write something about it. But, I must warn you ahead of time...I didn't get enough sleep last night and my current mood is a little delirious and strange. Enter at your own risk...It's been a while since I read this, so I am currently incapable of giving a detailed review. So you are absolutely guaranteed not to find any spoilers below. With that being said, the following is what still lingers in my memory when I try and think back on this book:1) It was a very addicting, quick read (like The couple next door and The girl on the train). 2) Despite being full of fairly unlikable characters, I found the characters to be very interesting and fun to read about, probably because they had personalities (unlike in The couple next door and The Girl on the train). 3) It kept me guessing and left me feeling satisfied (somewhat unlike TCND and TGOTT = let's be honest, we all knew what the twists were in those, even if we weren't sure about it at the time, didn't we? ) (yes, I'm resorting to acronyms now, despite how long and unattractive they are).4) If you like this sort of very popular relationship/at least one female in this story is most likely a psychotic murderer/mystery/thriller, then I don't think you can possibly go wrong with this one (sort of like Couple Next Door and Girl on Train except there's a few things that go wrong in those that made them less enjoyable than this one (see my reviews) (yes, I decided to abbreviate instead, the acronyms were just too unattractive and just as tedious).5) This book left me excited to read whatever this author writes next (I know what it is because a bunch of people have already read it and reviewed it on here even though it isn't out yet, I just can't think of the title (women staring through windows?). I'm more excited about it than the next books coming out by the authors of those other two books (NEN), but not excited enough to read Swanson's first book apparently (Girl with the clock heart), because I still haven't managed to get around to it. Perhaps it's because the word \"girl\" is in the title, which is quickly becoming the world's biggest eye roll.So that's saying something at least...For those of you who knew what (NEN) stood for without hesitation, I owe you lunch.Bottom line: This is a very enjoyable mystery that doesn't try too hard, it just is.Thank you for reading.Special Note: With all due respect to Shari Lapena and Paula Hawkins, they both wrote very good, enjoyable books. I just have fun ragging on some of the their less-than-stellar qualities. Special Note part 2: Some of you may be wondering why I failed to mention \"Gone girl\" anywhere in this review, since it's like the President of domestic thrillers with \"girl\" in the title, but I've just never been able to get into that book. I tried reading it like four times and kept putting it down. I'm pretty sure that statement is illegal at this point, but it's still the truth, none-the-less.Not so special note: I haven't read the Behind Closed Doors yet, but I want to."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "The whole time I was reading this I kept thinking of two lines in the poem, \"Marmion\" by Sir Walter Scott, taken completely out of context of course, \"Oh!

Yeah, yeah... there are similarities. This story revolves around four crazy people doing crazy stuff with plenty of crazy plot twists along the way just like that other book I mentioned. But, come on, this story is so much better. I loved how the story begins with Ted and Lily running into each other at the airport and having an interesting conversation. And, I loved how the second half of the book resets everything and flips the story into something completely different than I thought it was going to be. There is plenty of backstory here, too, so most of the characters have depth even if their pasts are ridiculously unbelievable at times. I mean you really have to just roll with this thing and not think about it too much because it's insane. I can't really say anything else without giving too much away.

It definitely has that vibe of psychologically damaged minds perpetrating dark deeds in the midst of a twisty, sinuous plot. It also shares the multiple POV narration, which when done well, can add SO MUCH to these types of stories. As it does here. I would actually argue that The Kind Worth Killing is an even stronger and more page-turning book than The Girl On the Train (whose underwhelming ending left me sort of underwhelmed by the time I was done, especially after such a great build-up). If you're going to write a page-turning psychological thriller piece like this you had better stick the landing, otherwise all your hard work leading up to the main event is going to feel wasted. It's all a house of cards, an illusion built using smoke and mirrors; you are asking the reader to suspend their disbelief and come along for the crazy ride. When it's all over, don't leave them feeling like they've been had. Play fair. Don't cheat.The Kind Worth Killing has a very noir sensibility in its tone and execution that I just lapped up like cream. And no surprise because the author is channeling Patricia Highsmith's classic crime novel Strangers on a Train that Hitchcock adapted into one of my favorite film noirs. When people start talking and planning the perfect murder, you know anything can -- and usually does -- happen. Along with its noir vibe, The Kind Worth Killing is also reminiscent of the old pulp fiction crime novels churned out on cheap paper during the first half of the 20th century -- where sex and violence are expected to go together like PB&J -- a marriage made in heaven if you will, or more accurately, hell. The characters are not meant to be likable, or even relatable, and the dialogue and writing style is strictly utilitarian -- nothing fancy -- just let's move the plot along here, we've got places we need to end up. It's not always easy getting from A to Z leanly and meanly. I really enjoyed the multiple POV narration here. It's probably what the novel does best. Sometimes there is some overlap too -- you get the same event described to you again but this time by a different character. It would be easy to screw that up and just have things seem repetitive. Here it's executed with aplomb and adds depth and interest to the story. At least it did for me. I would love to see this as a movie, especially if they fully committed to a noir style."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "The Kind Worth Killing\u201cThe Kind worth Killing\u201d by author Peter Swanson, is full of sociopathic, vengeful and backstabbing characters. It is a highly gripping, addictive and brilliantly executed psychological suspense novel. The novel is told from the perspective of alternative narratives between the main characters and it truly takes you on a very twisted and wild ride. Although there\u2019s bloodshed the author does not relishes in providing lots of gratuitous and gory details. One of my pet peeves is when people complain about a book because it has \u201cunlikable characters\u201d, I am pretty convinced that \u201cunlikable characters\u201d are far more interesting to read (and I am guessing write too) about. And these are truly unlikable and unreliable characters, so if you are with me on this point you are on for a treat! It has been mentioned that the author wrote this book to pay homage to Patricia Highsmith\u2019s \u201cStrangers on a Train\u201d. As the story opens, our main character, Lilly Kintner, a beautiful and mysterious redhead, is in fact sitting at a terminal at Heathrow airport reading a book by the renowned author, although instead of the well-known classic mystery, she is holding the lesser known \u201cThe Two Faces of January\u201d, and she points out is \u201cnot one of her (Highsmith\u2019s) best\u201d. This is where she accidentally encounters rich businessman Ted Stevenson (he\u2019s not quite Mr. Grey but close enough), who like Lily is on his way to Boston. Over drinks they start a conversation that would definitely not pass the \u201cjust small talk with a stranger\u201d test. Thanks to a delay in their flight, the certainty that they\u2019ll never see each other again and several Martinis, their exchange becomes much more candid. Later on during their night flight to Boston, Ted mentions that Miranda, his bohemian artist, gorgeous wife, is having an affair with Brad, their contractor. Half-seriously he reveals that what he\u2019d really want to do is kill her. Rather than being shocked by this revelation, Lilly\u2019s reaction is not only to be sympathetic to the idea but to actually offer to assist on the plotting and execution of the scheme.The title of the novel refers to Lily\u2019s almost nonchalant comment that Miranda, seems like \u201cthe kind worth killing\u201d. She rationalizes that \u201cwe are all going to die sooner or later \u201dso what difference does it makes \u201cif a few bad apples get pushed along a little sooner than God intended\u201d. Apparently this is all the moral support Ted needed to take this from: crazy idea in my head to let\u2019s get together to come up with an actual plan. Really crazy!Although this scene sounds outrageous and farfetched, Mr. Swanson very aptly draws the psychological background, particularly for Lily, that helps the reader understand this exchange and the events that follow. As the connection between Ted and Lily deepens, they start planning the demise of Miranda and her lover and how to get away with it.The first part of the book focuses on Lily\u2019s backstory. That includes a legacy of murder that goes back all the way to her own troubled childhood. Through the use of flashbacks, we have a chance to glimpse into her past. He does the same for Ted and the other characters, but they are not as flesh out as Lily's is.Although I don\u2019t always enjoy how many authors use this technique, I felt that in this case, Mr. Swanson\u2019s did a masterful job at using past narratives to draw pretty good psychological profiles of the characters, while at the same time holding back enough details to keep you guessing how everything is going to end.The 2nd part of the book delves deeper into the plotting to kill Miranda. It also adds the narrative perspective of two of the other main characters, Brad and Miranda.The 3rd part of the book becomes sort of a police procedural, albeit a low-key one, with a detective that although determined to uncover the truth, is part of a police force that's a little bit too inept. I don\u2019t want to give much more about the plot, but the ending was well done and I thought, nicely wrapped up with a satisfying conclusion.I have a few minor criticisms of the novel:* The author has a tendency to over-explain the characters motivations to the reader, this to me felt a little redundant and unnecessary sometimes.* To me Miranda and Lily sound too similar in their inner-dialogue and overall traits. They both fitted into the role of \"femme-fattale\" a little bit too neatly.*Perhaps this was premeditated, but it\u2019s difficult to know if the author wants the reader to empathize with Lily or to loathe her. Sometimes I like a clearer moral compass in my reading. Let\u2019s just say that I felt awkward whenever I caught myself rooting for one of the bad guys/gals (and I say this as someone that enjoyed all 7 seasons of Dexter!).As for the comparisons with Gone Girl, which seem inevitable these days, is fair to say that yes there's a similar story structure: a marriage unraveling in front of our eyes, a female character with sociopathic tendencies, and to a certain extend, unreliable narrators. But whereas Gone Girl focuses more on Amy Dunne's bitterness and sense of betrayal after Nick falls fart short of her expectations as a husband, and later on the conflicting stories as seen through their eyes, \"The Kind Worth Killing\" does not follows such a tight chronological timeline. It also relies not on two but three narrators. Ah and lest I forget this important detail: there's a much higher higher body count here!. And as astonishing as this sounds, Lily Kintner is a much more cold-hearted, manipulative and emotional unattached figure that Anne Dunne.In my opinion, \u201cThe Kind worth Killing\u201d is not a literary thriller, don\u2019t read this book looking for beautiful, profound prose, however if you are interested in a well written tale of revenge, lust and betrayal with some intriguing psychological nuances, I would definitely recommend it.Finally, although it's not always the case, the multiple-narration on this audiobook worked really well for me this time."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32081931-lisa", "userReview": "Murder Murder & more Murder that's what Peter Swanson takes you on in this thriller which made me think is murder that bad everyone lives everyone dies its as simple as that but HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO KILL & COULD YOU DO IT??While reading this brilliant novel i was thinking about my own mortality & how easy it would be to be pushed so far by people who you thought you knew but didn't ?
