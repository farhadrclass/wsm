The only problem I had was that the POV seemed to be that of a female (probably because it was written by a female?) so I had a hard time staying in the main character's head. He would say and do things that seemed unlikely for an adolescent/teenage boy. But hey, I had two brothers and have a teenage son maybe I'm a little jaded. Can you say, \"Where's my jeans?\""}, {"userName": "Eileen Mackin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38381708-eileen-mackin", "userReview": "I enjoyed the colorful southern expressions in this book and found it surprisingly humorous. But I was confused by the mixed voice of the storyteller, it was supposedly a male voice but felt female. I had to keep reminding myself that Claybird was a boy, which took away from the storyline flow."}, {"userName": "Korin Hall", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30511384-korin-hall", "userReview": "Very likeable main character.

The writing is fantastic and spot on when it comes to writing about the South (and the Florida South, at that). Because this story is told from the viewpoint of Clay during the age of 10-14 years old, the story is more heartbreaking in the sad parts and hilariously funny in the heartwarming parts. While observing the world through Clay's eyes, I could see everything he couldn't because he's simply too young to understand what's right in front of him. I loved his coming-of-age story and how he handled his grief and got over his learning disability with the help of his uncle Gabe. I loved reading about his battles with his siblings, his triumphs in school, and his complicated relationship with his mother, while navigating through adolescence and his grief over losing his father. The only reason I wouldn't give this story five stars is that it could use more dialogue in the areas where there are pages and pages of backstory. More dialogue could break that up a little and help with the flow of the story. Other than that, I'm actually surprised this author hasn't received more recognition. This is one of the best southern stories I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Melissa Crytzer Fry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3857699-melissa-crytzer-fry", "userReview": "Unintentionally, I\u2019ve picked up a series of stories recently with pre-teen narrators \u2013 and this one, like the others, did not disappoint. I absolutely loved this story of family secrets and the coming-of-age of the main character, Claybird. His voice is so original, and despite the very serious nature of the storyline, he had me laughing out loud more times than I can count. What a wonderful mix of humor and deeply felt emotion.I read this book on my Kindle on the treadmill, and zipped right through it (sure made the workout less painful!). It is character-driven fiction at its best: an introduction to a southern Florida family struck by truly devastating loss that, in the end, results in so much personal growth. We meet Claybird; siblings Sim and Missy; parents Myra and Michael; and Uncle Gabe, Aunt Candace and Grannie (and a few others). We learn their southern traditions, can nearly taste their mouthwatering southern cooking \u2013 and we see the influence of religious traditions on moral decisions.This is ultimately a story of the power of forgiveness and the strength of love. Wonderful, wonderful southern storytelling!"}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4316221-teresa", "userReview": "This book is about a boy named Clayton loses his father, Michael because he was dead. Then all of a sudden Uncle Gabe comes back. Clayton didn't know him at all because he disappeared twenty years ago when he was going up north. Uncle Gabe was so hilarious that it makes Clayton hanging out with him. It makes his world turn upside down because he was spending time with him that he don't spend time with his family. I pick this book as a three stars for rating because this book sometimes make me don't understand what it is going on since it have a lot of southern accents. I think cowboys would understand this book better. Anyway, this book is all about family relationships that happens in everyday lives."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19924977-anne", "userReview": "Another coming of age tale--another southern coming of age tale. This one told from the perspective of a preteen boy. Clayton \"Claybird\" Catts' finds the remedy for grief following the loss of his father in a hopeless history project--a project that has Claybird gathering family stories. He learns how his father and mother met, how his father persevered to overcome poverty and rise to millionaire status. But some family mysteries remain. Questions circle his brain and eventually some stories lead to clues to those family secrets. An explosive secret totally changes Claybird's life and begins a new round of questions...questions about his own identity."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680657-jenny", "userReview": "Janis Owens writes very well. The plot was interesting but was as slow-moving as the river that lazily flowed past my grandmother's trailer when I was a child. The days then were endless with only brief moments of excitement. The life of Claybird Catts is much the same. Owens insight into southern family is spot-on, though, and her descriptions of family dynamics resonated with me to the point that I kept reading."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25934468-elaine", "userReview": "Slow start (for me) but very beautiful and deep ending It's the kind of book where you want to say thank you to the author.
