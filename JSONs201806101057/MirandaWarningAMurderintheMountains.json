My prior acquaintance with Gilbert's work was through her Vikings of the New World duology (she's an outstanding new voice in historical fiction). Barb's not a historical fiction fan, on the whole; but I thought this novel, having a West Virginia mountain setting much like the Virginia Appalachian milieu where she grew up and we currently live, and featuring a strong female main character, might appeal to her.A West Virginia native (like her protagonist), Gilbert sets her novel in her own stamping grounds. The fictional small town of Buckneck is in west-central WV, near the Ohio River; the closest largish town is real-life Point Pleasant, which she describes with an assurance that suggests she genuinely knows the place. (At one point, she refers in passing to the 1774 battle there between the Virginia militia and the Shawnee Indians during Lord Dunmore's War, which had a resonance for me --that battle plays a significant part in Mary Schumann's Strife Before Dawn, which I read as a kid.) The rural country around Buckneck is home to the well-to-do Spencer clan, into which series sleuth Tess, now pregnant with her first child, has married. Like her fairly newly-fledged lawyer husband Thomas, she's college-educated, but she didn't grow up in affluence: she comes from a trailer park, with a father who abandoned her and her mother when she was small, and a mother who's in prison for drug dealing. She's not a professional detective; but she's observant, inquisitive, temperamentally inclined to suspect hidden meanings in statements and circumstances, and gifted with near photographic memory \u2013all qualities that come in handy for investigation. And while she doesn't have a concealed carry permit, she does carry a spring knife (and sometimes packs a Glock anyway). Loyalty to a friend is deeply ingrained in her makeup. So when her elderly best friend, who's recently begun seeing a widowed gentleman caller, gets a note warning her off \u2013written in the handwriting of the man's wife Rose, who was pronounced dead 40 years ago-- Tess takes it on herself to investigate.Two narrations alternate here: Rose's, in italics and past tense, at the beginning of each chapter, and Tess' own, in present tense and normal script, in the main body of the text. (The reader actually gets the hang of this arrangement quickly.) The mystery is well-constructed and baffling, and very little is as it initially seems. Only one thing is sure \u2013secrets have been concealed for decades, and they're ready to impact the present. Amateur snooping mixes with very well-evoked daily life in contemporary Appalachia, drawn with affection and sensitivity. The characters are absolutely real and life-like, even the minor ones. As a Christian author, Gilbert eschews objectionable language or lewd sexual content, but the religious content of the book is low-key, and more simply theistic than specifically Christian. The Spencers are a Christian family, but Tess herself, despite being exposed to church as a kid, starts off as a young woman who's not even entirely sure if she still believes in God. She's also not without a certain amount of emotional baggage from her formative years, and she's got a hot temper that's quick to take offense at times. She and Thomas love each other, but their marriage isn't without its fights and friction. IMO, these foibles tend to make her relateable to most readers, Christian and non-Christian. (She does have very strong pro-life views, which are expressed, in her thoughts, very forcefully at one point; so if that would horrify and offend you, this is your \u201ctrigger warning.\u201d) Barb found the novel \u201cdark\u201d overall, and it certainly has dark elements; but she also found a good deal of comic relief in Tess' wry narrative voice, and frequently laughed out loud at some comments. (I didn't, but I enjoyed the leavening of humor.) At a thematic level, the storyline explores the relationship of mother and child in its various permutations; and there's going to be some character growth by the end, always a plus.This is a series I definitely intend to follow \u2013and hope to get caught up to date on sooner rather than later.! (There are, so far, two sequels.)"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4075354-beth", "userReview": "Tess Spencer has been thrown some curveballs throughout her life, so she is no stranger to pain and heartache. She carries a knife and can handle a Glock on any day, ready to take on whatever comes her way. When an anonymous warning note, in the handwriting of a woman long dead, appears in her best friend Miranda\u2019s mailbox, Tess starts to follow a trail that went cold years ago. With very little go on but a handful of clues and her own tenacity, Tess attempts to unmask the killer before she or someone she loves becomes the next victim.Sometimes I fall for a male lead. Sometimes I admire a main characters fortitude, faith or courage. And sometimes I seriously wish that a character is real and would be my best friend, because, you know, that\u2019s a healthy reaction to have toward a fictional character, right? Well, right or wrong, I simply adored Tess Spencer! She is so quirky and unique, yet so utterly normal, I just wanted to find her and give her a hug and go out for coffee. In my head, we are totally besties, and our husbands should be besties too. They could go camping and do guy stuff while Tess and I do something girly and then\u2026oh, right, she isn\u2019t real! Heather has created a character that has lodged in my head like a real person, and that to me is a sign of her superb abilities as a writer.Tess isn\u2019t the only great thing about this novel. As someone who tends to shy away from the thriller/suspense genre, I wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d feel about Miranda Warning, but since I already trusted Heather as an author, it seemed logical that I would enjoy it. The setting of Buckneck, West Virginia has a very realistic quality to it that seems specific to areas located in the Appalachian Mountains. I can\u2019t put my finger on it specifically, but it\u2019s the way that the characters related to each other, the way they look out for each other and just an overall mysterious quality to the sense of place. There is a particularly beautiful set of sentences where Tess describes walking through the mountainous woods, describing its magnetism like \u201cgravity for my soul.\u201d So true and so simple, yet it feels very profound and is very telling of who Tess is as a character.The plot has a lot of twists and turns \u2013 just when I thought I knew what was coming, Heather adds another facet to the mystery \u2013 the story is compulsively readable, and while I\u2019m a quick reader in general, I think I read this one in only a handful of sittings. I\u2019m also a big fan of first-person narration, and Heather does it really well. Although the story follows Tess, there is another character that speaks throughout the story as well, and it was easy to differentiate between their two voices.The secondary characters are all multi-faceted and have their individual idiosyncrasies that provide depth and extra layers to the mystery of the story. The friendship between Tess and Miranda was so endearing and humorous. It is obvious that they have been close for a long time, and that Tess won\u2019t let anyone mess with Miranda. Throughout the story, it is revealed that Miranda took Tess under her wing when she was going through some things years before. I liked the way that Heather revealed things about Tess and the other characters, but still leaves some things to be revealed later in the series. Although I\u2019m sure the revelations were purposeful and planned, they feel very natural and realistic within the story. Tess and Thomas are so refreshing as a couple; whether it was bantering, bickering or a more romantic moment, all of their interactions feel genuine. I really loved his family as well; I\u2019m pretty sure they should really exist, too!Though the spiritual aspect of the story is not obvious on the outset, it is woven throughout the story gradually, and propels to a hopeful ending. Tess\u2019s inner dialogue of her fears, frustrations and triumphs feel true and real, and I found myself relating to her many times (besides wanting to be her bestie and all that). I highly recommend Miranda Warning for readers that like a mystery with a psychological bend to them. It is one of my favorite reads of 2015, and I\u2019m eager to read the continuation of Tess\u2019s story, Trial by Twelve!"}, {"userName": "Heather Gilbert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7169046-heather-gilbert", "userReview": "Once again I feel kind of dorky reviewing my own book, but otherwise it keeps popping up as unread and I know that's not true.

As all mystery lovers know, it\u2019s important to love a series\u2019 main character, and I love Tess Spencer, the heroine of Miranda Warning. She\u2019s intensely loyal, she\u2019s both kind and tough, she carries a Glock or a knife when she does her sleuthing (the woman lives in the West Virginia mountains, after all, and she is no fool), and she says things like \u201cMore coffee is never a bad thing.\u201dBut this book\u2019s plot is also terrific--full of unforeseen twists and turns--and the writing is top-notch. The book is rich in every sense of the word--rich in characters (all of them complex and realistic), in details and clues, in setting, and in suspense.

I knew the author was extremely talented from reading her Viking fiction, God's Daughter and Forest Child. Now that I have seen how skilled she is with contemporary (and mystery, no less!) I am even more impressed. I loved the structure of the book, how it was told from two points of view with two different timelines, so I was given clues along the way in addition to what Tess Spencer, the main protagonist was uncovering herself. I enjoyed all the characters, and I must say that listening to it on Audible gave it an extra layer of dimension. The narrator did a fabulous job of making each voice distinctive. I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent with Tess in Buckneck, West Virginia, and can't wait to see what's brewing in the next novel, Trial by Twelve."}, {"userName": "Sarita", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37168935-sarita", "userReview": "Tess Spencer's friend, Miranda, receives a note from her friend who died 40 years ago. Tess is wondering who would do this and why and starts to look into Rose's death.If you would ask me if I prefer 3rd person to 1st person, I would always choose 3rd person. However, the 1st person narrative in this mystery novel were laid out well and drew me in from the start. Tess was a quirky fun, lovable character, with her faults and I found myself smiling at a lot of her sayings and the fights she had with her husband (scenes where I could totally picture myself and my husband). Not only was the main character very enjoyable, but the secondary characters were equally great - I adored Nikki Jo.At the beginning of each chapter, we got a glimpse of events from the past. I was totally intrigued with Rose's story and found myself reading page after page whenever I could to see what was happening. It also helped that the chapters were short so I was possible to squeeze in a chapter or 2 when I had a few minutes here and there.The mystery was enjoyable with lots of events and twists. The author also did a great job of taking you as reader from disliking one character to totally understand and liking that character by the end of the book. The twists and turns were placed at the right times in the mystery. There was however 1 or 2 twists which was revealed later in the story which I started to consider as possibilities, so I was not totally thrown when these were revealed.This was my first book by Heather Day Gilbert. Looking forward to read more from Tess and her friends."}, {"userName": "Joleen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5543196-joleen", "userReview": "I'm a little over 50% done with this book and felt the need to write. I'm enjoying this so much. I had just finished a book about Vikings by Heather Day Gilbert, and knew I had another of her books in my cloud stash, so I downloaded it and started right in. So.....only two things are similar about these two books....female lead and use of weapons. But the female leads couldn't be more opposite. In the last book (Freydis) the Viking heroine's favorite weapons were her sword, her bow and arrows, and her small curved knife she kept razor sharp. In this story, the heroine (Tess) is modern, not nearly as sure of herself as Freydis, loves her husband and his family, and her best friend is an old woman named Miranda.This book just cracks me up. It's not like it was meant to be specifically a comedy, but the way this woman reacts to everything is just funny. She's clearly not afraid of weapons, because she picks up anything close by to use in the event something is a threat. I mean I'm halfway through the book and I can count at least seven times she's picked up a weapon of some sort, from a Glock to a kitchen knife. When she finds out her best friend (Miranda) had a threatening note sent to her, she's suddenly on a mission to find out what that was all about. The note threatens Miranda to stay away from the man she's seeing, and the handwriting is exactly the same as Miranda's long dead best friend, Rose, (also the late wife of the man she's seeing). Not likely that Rose is writing notes from the grave, Tess sets out to find out all about this Paul, and Rose, who took her life 40 years ago.Oh, it gets good, but it's also fun. Tess gets threats too, a woman seems to be stalking her. She has some huge blonde German florist named Axel, who she used to know in high school, seemingly showing up at different times, which is purplexing. She doesn't trust nor care for Miranda's new beau, nor does she trust the doctor treating Miranda, nor does she trust at least two of the employees at Miranda's nursing home.Will write more later when I finish it....Well, finished it and it continued to be just as good as the previous half. Plus there were a few surprises in there that I sure as heck didn't expect! I really liked this book. I just can't get over how different it was from the Viking book of Ms Gilbert's, and that they were both so well done! That to me is indicative of a good author!One thing I might point out is the switch back and forth in voices. It's first person, and switches from Tess to Rose every few pages. Sometimes I had to stop and ponder who's talking. But it was fun, well done, and I recommend it for a light yet intelligent read."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10318483-carol", "userReview": "Miranda Warning is an interesting and intriguing mystery read.The story introduces Tess and Thomas Spencer.

I have to say the author did a fabulous job of balancing the characters Christian beliefs with a great little mystery.The author also introduced me to a great new heroine in Tess Spencer. I really love strong women who can still be vulnerable and really like reading books where the lead is happily married. And no they are sickly sweet married, they have fights but still manage to show a good strong relationship takes work. The mystery is phenomenal even though I had it figured out about halfway through and I think most other readers will too but the author balances that with her small clues with great writing. You find yourself rooting for Tess and loving the Spencer clan. If this book has a downside it is the thoughts Tess has in her mind, in one conversation she can go from thinking a person is a complete psychopath to sensing they are as innocent as a lamb. It was kind of crazy when after about the fourth character introduction she had gone through the whole thought process with each of them.Becky Doughty does a fabulous job as a narrator \u2013 even with the story being told from two perspectives I never got lost or confused.

Heather Day Gilbert captures the mysterious appeal of the mountains well, combining it with superbly-drawn characters, unusual plot twists, a quick pace, and a satisfying conclusion. The author used her first-person, present-tense voice to her advantage, giving a strong sense of immediacy to this murder-in-the-past tale. Tess is a quirky but not over-the-top narrator with a good sense of humor, a past with which we can sympathize, and concerns that we understand. She is not a passive protagonist, yet neither is she obnoxiously \u201cin-your-face.\u201d I liked how she could admit wrongdoing, change her opinions of people, and acted with the best interests of others foremost in her mind.The supporting characters were well-rounded and three-dimensional, from Tess\u2019 somewhat-flamboyant mother-in-law Nikki Jo to the distasteful Paul! I loved the diversity portrayed in the Spencer family overall.Gilbert threw in a twist toward the end that I hadn\u2019t expected, which lent a rather melancholy (in a good way) sense to the ending. Glad she did that; it made this go from a good whodunit into really intriguing territory. The ending resolved loose ends well yet gave me something to look forward to in the next book.Any cons? I wish the Christian element had flowed throughout the book a little more strongly. The references to Christianity tended to be fairly vague until toward the end. And there were a few instances where the language edged toward crudeness, which disappointed me.Overall, this was a really enjoyable \u2013 somewhat frightening! \u2013 read with good writing, well-shaped characters, and a fast-paced storyline.

When I found out her next book was taking the leap from historical fiction to contemporary mystery, I was curious and eager to see what this one would be like. I found it highly enjoyable, sharing some of the best features of the author's earlier work, including vivid settings and a strong and relatable heroine.Just like in God's Daughter, Miranda Warning features settings vividly described with just the right details to put you in the scene with the characters without bogging down the action. In this case the setting is modern day West Virginia... and West Virginia from forty years ago.Each chapter features a short segment from the past, followed by more lengthy scenes set in the present. Tess Spencer is trying to figure out just what happened in the past before her friend Miranda makes what could be a dangerous mistake in the present. Meanwhile, someone or something is threatening her and her investigation. I thought the format worked very well, with the details from the past being revealed at just the right times to keep suspense high and complement the modern day investigation. The mystery and suspense elements definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.Then there's the strong and spunky heroine. I really liked Tess, especially her dry sense of humor, and I found myself relating to her in a number of areas. Loved her line about preferring a throwing star to practice her ninja skills. She's friendly and down-to-earth, but she keeps a knife or gun in her pocket just in case. I have a feeling I'd really enjoy hanging out with her ... if she were a real person ... except maybe for the danger she seems to attract. With that in mind, it's probably safer for me to just continue reading the series as it's published. ;)Faith played a relatively small part in this story, but I enjoyed what was there. Miranda makes an interesting point when she compares Tess's situation to another character's, saying, \"She wouldn't go to church or read her Bible. So her views of God got warped, like wet floorboards.\" (Page 273. I loved the wet floorboards comparison so I had to include that quote.) Anyway, I'm curious to see how Tess's faith might develop over the course of the series.A big thank you to the author for providing me with an electronic review copy for purposes of this review.To learn more about Heather Day Gilbert and her books, check out her Web site and Facebook page.

From the first line, 'I chose the day I would die', to the last word, this book totally had me hooked!I finished in less than 24 hours because I absolutely could not tear myself away from this book! The author creates a mystery so intense tht I was guessing up until the last chapter! For a while, I'd think one thing was going on, then the mystery shifted a bit and I'd have another conclusion. None of which were correct.Rose Campbell dies one night in 1973, apparently a suicide. She'd lived a miserable life ever since her marriage and apparently she chose the only way out she could.Fast forward 40 years and her once best friend, Miranda, receives a warning note, seemingly from Rose herself. However, Rose is dead. Miranda, whose health is declining, lives in an assisted living family. Tess Spencer is one of her dearest friends, even though young enough to be Miranda's granddaughter. Tess decides she is going to solve this mystery of who sent Miranda the note. Tess totes a knife and a Glock, but when suddenly odd things begin happening, she finds herself in a mystery that she did not even think was possible. The reader is totally swept into this mystery from the first page and is kept guessing till the last page.Heather Day Gilbert has created a scenario that is entirely believable, full of darkness, lies, ghosts, and long kept secrets. Each character is well developed so that the reader truly feels they know each person in this book. I felt as if I were part of this story as I read along. I have learned that this book is the first in a series and I am absolutely tickled to hear this good news!Do NOT miss this book. You will LOVE it!"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7497829-sharon", "userReview": "An excellent mystery by an author who can spin a good mystery and create characters that are very believable, all while respecting West Virginia and its native sons and daughters without resorting to stereotypes. All this while leaving out filthy language, unnecessary sex (in fact, there are no sex scenes at all) or explicit violence. Oh, yes, some violence takes place, some in the past and a small amount in the present but no lurid descriptions and no \"blow-by-blow\". There was plenty of love, both romantic, married love and family love. There was plenty of menace. It was a WONDERFUL breath of fresh air. I urge Ms. Gilbert to continue her writing career. There are many readers out here who welcome fresh new mysteries and some love (both romantic and family) without reading endlessly of the Amish."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27876029-denise", "userReview": "This is an entertaining read. It is fun, serious, intriguing and touches on subjects that are, well, touchy. There is stalking, murder, adultery, mental problems, disfunctional families, drugs, secrets, abortion, lies, spying etc. A well woven tale. The main character, Tess, narrates the story. She is newly pregnant and hormonal. The story consists of her trying to protect her elderly friend from being taken advantage of financially, emotionally, mentally and physically. She is trying to solve a cold-case involving her friends' best friend of 40 years ago who's suicide began the whole thing. So many unanswered questions from years ago need to be answered and Tess is bound and determined to find those answers. A surprise ending wraps up the tale.

Written in first person POV, this\u00a0book kept me in suspense from the first chapter. Heather writes with such detail that I really felt like I was right there in the story.Tess is quite the formidable heroine, while she has fears, she quickly rises above them and isn't afraid to do what needs to be done. She has a strong sense of loyalty and wishes to see that justice is upheld. I couldn't help but appreciate her fortitude in the face of uncertain disaster, and her strong support of her aging friend Miranda.My favorite stories are heart-warming, sweet, feel-good romance. If that is the kind of story you enjoy and are looking for; then this may not be the story for you. Please don't get me wrong, the writing is first-rate, top notch. The characters are vivid and dynamic, rich with their own unique personality. The plot line is phenomenal.If you are searching for a story where the subject matter is intense and full of drama and intrigue. If you enjoy spine-tingling mystery and are searching for a story that will keep you up late into the night, and keep you guessing until the end, then my friend look no further.(I purchased the kindle version of this book.

The setting is Appalachian West Virginia, and it was hard to put the book down. It had everything a good mystery needs - a suspenseful and believeable plot, authentic characters and unpredictability. She also included bits of accurate history, so she obviously has done good research. Such a nice change from books that rewrite history along the lines of what they WISH had happened. I appreciated that she touched on the poignant issue of Domestic Violence in the book. Several of the characters were middle-aged and even elderly, and that was a refreshing change, as well. There is only room for so many coming-of-age stories. Sometimes, adults like to read about adults!
