I absolutely LOVED this book but it frustrated the hell out of me! Carson or Turner? Happy or Sad? Who and what did I want Sam to choose? I loved Carson from the start. Who is this Turner guy and why can't I decide if I like him? One minute I adore him, the next he pissed me off, kind of like what Sam was going through. When I finally came to my decision and what I wanted to happen happened, I changed my mind again. Seriously, what gives!? I finally made peace with the decisions made and not a page later, BAM!! More devastation in Sam's life. Why? I know this is fiction but how much can one person take? When is enough enough? This book not only kept me awake all hours of the night, it also kept me an emotional wreck. I couldn't stop reading but afraid to continue at the same time, wondering what could possibly happen. This girl has been to hell and back. The only stability in her life are her parents and I started to think that nothing could go wrong there......hoped it wouldn't anyway. Her relationship with her brother was slowly killing me. I was almost finished with the book and there wasn't much room left for anything else to happen...or so I thought. Frustration and anguish gripped me yet again. I've cried like a baby throughout this entire book, right until the end. Desert Rice and Desert Flower are MUST READS!! When you do, you will feel exactly as I do now. There aren't enough words to express my praise for these two books."}, {"userName": "Jillian (NetGalley Addict)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9844373-jillian-netgalley-addict", "userReview": "This book was part of a blog tour,I was given a copy for my honest reviewSamantha finds what she thinks is a naked dead man in the desert, only he is alive. This is the second dead body that she has found, the first one was her mother when she was 12. Seven years later and she is working towards becoming a veterinarian. She is torn between two men and a past that just won't stay hidden. This is actually the second books in this series and I would really recommend reading Desert Rice before starting Desert Flower, it's not necessary but it helps with Samantha's backgrounds . I liked this book, I can't pinpoint exactly why, it made me cry and the love triangle was a bit frustrating. However, there was just something there that made me not want to put it down. The emotional depth to this novel was refreshing, the characters have a sense of maturity not often seen in young adult novels. The authors writing was impeccable, the characters emotions leap of the page and I could see the scenes playing out like a movie. Desert Flower is a great book, just make sure you have the tissues ready."}, {"userName": "Shari", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3251647-shari", "userReview": "Loved! Full review to come during the blog tour"}, {"userName": "Bailee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6374127-bailee", "userReview": "The book was addicting to say the least. I'll admit that I didn't plan on reading it as fast as I did but once I picked it up, it was impossible to put it down. This whole story is an emotional roller coaster that sometimes I wanted to get off and pretend I'd never experienced it in the first place. But I am glad that I finished it because it really was a great read, just an extremely emotional one. ... Authors should not enjoy making readers cry but it's stories like this that make me believe they do. I guess I can understand that though, the power to evoke emotions proves how powerful a story really is.Desert Flower by Angela Scott is a continuation of the story of Sam, a girl broken by her past, from her previous book, Desert Rice. But now Sam is all grown up and facing the fate of becoming an adult in a world that she fears because of her past. A chance encounter with a man in the desert leads to a series of events that turn her world upside down and make her doubt everything she has ever believed. She begins to trust this man, Turner, with things that she hasn't trusted anyone with before and she finds herself pulling away from the man, Carson, who helped her through her past. Is she making the right choice or is she going down the wrong path, one that will certainly lead to her demise? But no choice is easy and instead of making one, she hides from it until fate makes it impossible for her to ignore all of the choices that she's made. Once it's too late to turn back, what will she do? Will she make a choice? Will it be the right one? How many people will get hurt along the way?Sam, the main character, was really easy to relate with in the beginning and if anything, she deserved at least a small amount of pity on my part. I know that I wouldn't be strong enough to deal with what she went through and still function like a normal person or even slightly normal. In that sense, I am in awe of her. She deserves praise for her strength but sadly, she is also very weak. Her need to hide from reality, to know things with a large amount of certainty, leads to a great amount of selfishness. It is her great character flaw. She doesn't think before she acts and she forgets that her actions influence other people. By the time she learns this lesson, so much time has passed and so much hurt has been accrued by those who love her that some relationships might not be repairable. I think her character has more growth in this story than any other character in any other book I've read for awhile and that's saying something. Because of her choices, she is stretched to her limits and by the end of the story, she has learned her lesson and taken responsibility for her choices. Maybe then she can be happy.Turner and Carson are the love interests of this story. I hate to say that I picked a favorite but when there are two guys, I kind of have to pick a favorite and I root for them through the story. Needless to say, I was heartbroken by the end of the story but I understood why everything happened the way it did. Anyway, onto the characters since I am not mentioning my favorite. Read the book and you'll know who. Turner is introduced at the beginning of the story and he manages to get under Sam's skin in no time. He has this confident air about him that seems to irritate her even when he does nothing but there is also a sweetness to him that manages to keep her from killing him constantly. It is a relationship that is filled with passion and hope for the future. He wants her to be happy and he just wants her, is that so wrong? Carson has been with her the longest and seen her through the worst of her life. He wants to be what brings about the best in her life, he wants to be the man that has a family with her, and he wants to be the man that she loves with all her heart. But she is uncertain about their relationship. She doesn't know how she feels about him outside of friendship and she doesn't know if she is ready for any commitment, especially with him. He makes her feel adored and cared about and yet, she can't help but feel unworthy of him.Sam's family is perhaps the brightest spot of this whole story. There is something about a family that sticks together through the horrible parts of life and it was nice to see that there are flaws in that family. Sometimes they purposefully hurt each other, testing the strength of their relationships but they always seem to find their way back to each other. Boone and Laura are her adoptive parents. They are her greatest supporters, her biggest advocates, and they know everything about her. For a girl who hides herself away behind her secrets, she has a bond with them that is unwavering and no matter what happens, she knows they have her back. I am honestly jealous of that sort of relationship because I know that I'll at least never have that with my dad. Her relationship with her brother, Jacob, is heart-wrenching to say the least. After being through so much together, they still have the traits of siblings. They hurt each other, sometimes without meaning to, and underneath it all, they still love each other. They have each other's backs through whatever happens even when they act like they don't. Now, that is a relationship I can understand. It kind of reminds me of my brother's relationship with me except it isn't so violate.I do love this story with all its ups and downs. I hate the heartache but love the characters. It is the stories like this one that make you want to shake the characters until they realize their mistakes. It's stories like this that make you realize why your life is so good. It's stories like this that make you grateful."}, {"userName": "Danica Page (One Page at a Time)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2368342-danica-page-one-page-at-a-time", "userReview": "My Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars.Disclaimers: I received an electronic copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. I was not obligated to write a good review and I didn't receive any compensation for writing this review. An Overview of the Novel: Samantha Jean Haggart was not expecting to find a naked dead man in the desert. Even worse, she wasn't expecting the dead man to actually be alive. When Samantha was 12, she ran away with her brother Jacob and they met every disastrous situation possible. Now seven years later, she's attending veterinarian school and is feeling deeply conflicting feelings for Connor, her best friend.But she also is attracted to Turner and she doesn't really know what to think or what to do. She seems to mess up everything she touches lately. Her past is converging with her present, and if she doesn't change things, then she's going to ruin her future too. My Overall Thoughts/Impressions: I'm not entirely sure what to think about this novel. It was intriguing and gripping and yet frustrating and yet oddly satisfying. And basically, I don't even know what to think about this novel. I'm not even sure how to put my thoughts into words. But here we go.Samantha was an intriguing character who I found myself sympathizing with. Half the time I wanted to yell at her, but I knew why she was doing what she was doing and so it didn't frustrate me too badly. I really liked Connor and Turner too. I'm not sure which one I liked better. I think I liked Turner better, but I don't know if he was the better guy for her. Plus, we don't really know that much about Turner.Anyway, the writing was impeccably done. I loved the plot line and the overall story. The novel touched upon a lot of deep issues. I wished it would have expanded more on those issues, but it was really well-written.I would recommend this book to fans of new adult novel. It's the second in a series. The first novel takes place when she was 12 and sets the stage for this novel. This novel can be read as a stand-alone; however, readers should read both of them to get the full experience with the novel. In Summary: Angela's novel is incredibly written, touches upon deeper issues that several ya/NA books. Her novel is compelling and will draw readers in from page one.Warnings/Side-notes: This is an upper new-adult novel and has some content not suitable for children or people under the age of sixteen. The Wrap-up: Angela Scott's Desert Rice and Desert Flower were both really gripping, intriguing reads. I definitely recommend them to fans of realistic contemporary novels."}, {"userName": "Natalia Heaney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8641104-natalia-heaney", "userReview": "Originally posted HERE.I\u2019m trying not to give away too much of the storyline here...As soon as I finished Desert Rice I was wondering what to read next. To my absolute delight, I discovered there was a sequel to the book, and I started reading it immediately. Desert Flower sure gives you a lot to think about, and I plan to read it a second time, now I know the outcome of the tangled relationships.It was a good book. However, it was a full-on adult romance, whereas the first book was Young Adult Fiction. In this sequel the narrator is now an adult, and she is involved in a love triangle with men in their mid-twenties or older. Themes in this one include marriage and childrearing, so it is definitely taking the characters into a different phase of their lives.If you asked me what tropes I liked the least in romances, they would be love triangles and secret babies. Desert Flower has both of them, and yet I found the book to be compulsive reading. It was just as much a page-turner as the first.I had an issue with a massive secret Sam kept to herself in the first book, and was happy to see that situation resolved here. However, then she goes and cancels out her good deed by doing practically the same thing all over again! It\u2019s a personal thing for me; I\u2019ve had experiences of my own that have caused me to believe there\u2019s no such thing as a good secret.This is both a romance of sorts, but also a drama. Sam had horrific things happen to her when she was younger, and those experiences have shaped who she is and the way she reacts to things here. Issues such as depression are covered realistically, and often painfully. I really do hate when a love triangle means a good man ends up hurt, and that is the case here \u2013 but I just made up my own little happy ending for him in my head!While I have no doubt you could read this one without reading Desert Rice first, here\u2019s my advice: don\u2019t. The first book is such a deep dark, emotional story, and I don\u2019t see how Desert Flower could have the same impact on you without it.If you\u2019re looking solely for YA, stick to Desert Rice. If you think you\u2019re at a stage to handle grown-up Sam too, read these books close together, like I did. The impact is massive."}, {"userName": "Christina  Torretta", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8264810-christina-torretta", "userReview": "After reading Desert Rice last year I just knew I had to get my hands on this one. Now, I know sometimes sequels can be really iffy but somehow Angela Scott has managed to make this just as memorable as Desert Rice.You have the same characters that you fell in love with before and I was really glad that she threw in a bit here and there about Sam\u2019s past. It\u2019s nice having your memory jogged but not having SO much detail that you\u2019re dragged down and Angela has a great middle ground with this. Actually, you could probably read this without reading the first but the first really does introduce the characters and gives you a sense of what they\u2019re fighting for. Also, some things come back to bite Sam in the behind and if you\u2019re not knowledgable about them, although Angela again reminds us what happened, but still it might not make complete sense.So, we\u2019re given book two, completely thrown into the fire. And it really does feel like that from page one. They finally have their lives in order and then ALL this stuff crops up. And it\u2019s not even stuff out of the ordinary, it could happen to anyone, but Sam really does have a knack for finding some crazy stuff in life.What I love about this story is the raw emotion. Everything that Sam and her brother have gone through are right there. This brought tears to my eyes multiple times and really makes you just want to reach into the book and give this poor girl a hug!What I didn\u2019t like were her choices. Sometimes she does what she thinks OTHER people want, particularly men. Now I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a bad thing but after what she went through in Desert Rice, it is a bad thing. She needs to put her wants and needs above anyone else!! And although this adds to the plot, it absolutely killed me! After pulling her out of the book and hugging her, I wanted to just shake her!The plot is there, movement was fabulous. Characters as always with Angela Scott are amazing. Sam is so strong and yet so fragile, it\u2019s so real. I love these kinds of characters and although the plot is a lot (the first story is about rape) it\u2019s not something that has to be trudged through."}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7156510-ana", "userReview": "I cannot believe it, seriously I am still trying to process everything that just happened. Beginning to end you are basically trying to figure out who is going to be the winner of Sam's heart and to be completely honest since the beginning I was on the Turner team. Not just because of how delicious he sounded but also because he was funny and like she said he treated her like a normal girl. He didn't know anything about her past and he never really asked, he was a bit of a tease but he was just being sarcastic most of the time.  Fighting with the memories of her past while these two guys show her affection and fight for her was definitely the hardest part of it all. It actually made her think more about what had happened to her rather than forget. I know they both cared about her but they kind of crossed the line especially Turner with those comments about her underwear and such. I really liked Turner he was so giving and thoughtful, he cared a lot about Sam he didn't ever hurt her in any way. He seemed so perfect for her. So that is why I was rooting for that relationship. Once he left I knew that had to be the the end of it. Carson was great I like him in the first book but in this one I kind of placed him in the brother/friend zone that is all I saw him as. I just couldn't see her ever loving him in any other way. By the end of the book I almost thought he was going to turn into another Joe, he was kind of rude I know it would be terrible to be in his situation but sadly he took it to another level. He crossed the line when he kicked her out without Hannah. But apart from all the drama, romance, mystery and heartbreak it was a fantastic book. I love Angela Scott's writing she has a unique way of making the characters including the emotions jump out of the pages and come alive. Everything felt so real and that's the part I enjoy the most. I recommend reading it, if you don't you are missing out on such an amazing read"}, {"userName": "Kristi (Books and Needlepoint)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1699270-kristi-books-and-needlepoint", "userReview": "Reviewed by Tori: I read Desert Rice in preparation for reading Desert Flower and am glad that I read them in order. The first book gave me some background and insight into the story that may not have had quite the same punch without reading it. I liked seeing the strong relationship between Jacob and Sam evolve - in the first book Sam is only twelve, but is wise beyond her years due to her circumstances. She has lived through sexual abuse, betrayal, murder, but has also learned how strong family bonds can be, even if they are not related by blood.  Desert Flower starts out seven years later and her relationship with Carson (a boy who had become her protector in Desert Rice) has changed into a physical one. Feeling confused, days later she also sleeps with Turner. This creates one very interesting love triangle. I enjoyed that Jacob was still so supportive of Sam, even though he knew about both men in her life. You also got to learn more about Laura and Boone in this book - they had taken them in in Desert Rice and without owing anybody any obligation have adopted them as their own. In Desert Flower this relationship solidifies and you see what great people they really are. The pace of the book was consistent throughout Desert Rice and Desert Flower. The story would move along over a period of days and then jump ahead a few weeks - which was confusing at first, but then I came to expect the jumps in time. This wasn't really my style of book, as I really enjoy fantasy and sci-fi - but I found myself very involved in the story and did not want to stop reading. I have a feeling there is a third book that could come out of this story. My mom just told me that she has written a Zombie series and I am really looking forward to reading those!"}, {"userName": "Jo-Anna Walker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5856059-jo-anna-walker", "userReview": "After reading both of these books, I'd have to say that this one is my favorite. I love them both but this one, wow. I thought the emotional turmoil couldn't get worse then the first book but this one, knocked my socks off.I think from the first page to the very last, I was on the edge of my seat. If I had time, I could have read this book in one sitting. After finding a naked man in the desert in the beginning of the book, Sam's life is thrown for a loop. What Sam goes through...wow. I don't want to give away any spoilers but I just have to say, the ending?? Wow!! Seriously?? I need more. A book can NOT end like that. It can not. But of course I am arguing with myself because I enjoy books that have cliff hanger endings. It leaves me wanting more. In this case though, I NEED more. AND I just love Turner! I do. But I love Carson also. I love them all.Angela Scott has been amazing through out my journey of reading these two books. Poor thing has had to put up with my PM's and she has the patience of a Saint.These two books are now high are my list of favorite books that I have ever read. I just loved them.

I thought the prequel to this story, Desert Rice, was the best book I'd read in 2013- but I have to say, I think I preferred the second one better. I fell in love with Sam and Carson a few months ago when I read Desert Rice, but this more mature, conflicted Sam broke my heart and lifted it right back up with her sweet nature and broken thoughts. Right alongside Sam, I experienced everything from the conflict of loving two vastly different men, to her fears and feelings of inadequacy due to long ago events.Desert Flower is a beautiful, albeit heart-wrenching story of standing up to your past and learning to bend, rather than break when life just piles on the hard challenges. I loved loved loved this book and I strongly recommend this story (but read Desert Rice first, while this could probably be a stand alone, you will get more out of the reading experience if you travel Sam's journey through her 12/13-year old eyes in the first book).

It takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride. You really learn to develop emotional ties to all of the characters. The wonderful love triangle between Carson, Turner and Sam is wonderfully done. You really cannot predict who Sam will choose. You understand the choices that Sam must make, but you don\u2019t always agree with her reasoning. I did not get a chance to read Desert Rice but after having read Desert Flower I feel I want to go back to how everything started. Sam\u2019s emotional baggage is so intense that you truly would never with that kind of trama on even your worst enemy.Angela Scott is such a gifted story teller. Her ability to weave a story and develop characters is on par with authors such as Nicholas Sparks and Richard Paul Evans. She has an uncanny ability to draw in the reader and take them on an emotional and almost physical journey through the tough life choices that are contaminated with a past that would be tough for an adult let alone a teenager.

I loved the family dynamic and how easily they could invite a new member into the household. I could picture myself sitting at their dinner table. Their acceptance of Jacob's daughter was so heart felt. Each chapter brought a new twist or turn.
