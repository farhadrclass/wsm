She was about to embark on a new timesplash with her boyfriend Sniper and two of his friends. But stuck up high in the cage with the chanting of hundreds of young people below, she suddenly knew she didn\u2019t want to go through with it. Sniper wasn\u2019t having a bar of it though; ignoring her fears while the countdown went on. Suddenly she was weightless, flying through the blackness and terrified she was going to die\u2026Jay was only nineteen but in the years since he\u2019d lost his best friend at the timesplash party when it had all gone wrong, he\u2019d joined forces with a team who were determined to stop Sniper and the timesplashing \u2013 the time travel was now being used as a terrorist weapon and one disaster was following another, with thousands dying each time. Sandra had escaped the facility which had held her since that terrible night the timesplash had gone wrong \u2013 her paranoia, terror and nightmares were there with her always. But she knew she needed to find Sniper \u2013 he was the only one who could allay her fears; give her back her life again. With the police after her, Sandra met up with Jay and together they joined forces to locate Sniper before he created the biggest disaster in history. But could it happen? Was Sniper crazy; would he succeed in his horrific plan?Timesplash by Aussie author Graham Storrs is a very different take on time travel \u2013 filled with tension and very fast paced, the plot is intriguing as well as gruesome (but not \u201cin your face\u201d) There are good guys and bad guys, and the entertainment level is high. Recommended for lovers of science fiction and time travel."}, {"userName": "Janette", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2931151-janette", "userReview": "I'm a bit wary of time travel novels, because writers either ignore unresolved paradoxes, or get themselves so entangled, they have to make plot holes to clamber out again. For those unfamiliar with time travel, the most basic paradox is the one where you travel back in time, kill your own grandfather, and consequently never exist in order to go back in time and kill your own.... you get the point.Happily, Graham Storrs has created a stunningly elegant solution, which sits at the heart of this exciting thriller, set in the near future. Time travellers are \"lobbed\" back in time, like bricks into a pond, ultimately being dragged back to the present after a few hours. The impact of the consequent ripples is what causes all the problems.The action is tense and believable; characters are well-rounded and psychologically plausible; and the resolution is immensely satisfying. It has that best quality of all adventure stories: it's impossible to put down.Highly recommended if you're after an action thriller that's well-written, clever and - in my opinion - a damn sight better on all fronts than the latest Dan Brown. In fact, I'm not sure I should mention these two authors in the same breath - it seems disrespectful to Storrs.A final note: this book has been published ONLY as an electronic book, an appropriate choice for a book about the future! If you plan to purchase this e-book, buy it through the publisher, Lyrical Press, rather than Amazon. You may pay a few cents more (depending on your country) but purchasing from the publisher means the author earns significantly more."}, {"userName": "Zoey ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11285213-zoey", "userReview": "3.5\u2605A different & interesting take on time-travel & what happens when you do, mixed with lots of action set in the not too distant future. One major mistake (probably minor to a lot of people) that stood out to me was when they mentioned that Henry VII was King in 1902, ummm no it was Edward VII (Henry VII was late 15th century).

In a nutshell: when you travel back in time, you can\u2019t change history, but you can make \u201csplashes\u201d that ripple through the fourth dimension, causing havoc in the era you came from. The concept is illustrated brilliantly in the first chapter, and from there things go off the rails for the characters. It\u2019s tense, actiony and generally a brilliant execution of a brilliant idea.The details of the world are really well-articulated and convincing. End of oil, economic collapse, the fact that America is basically a Christian fascist state with the CIA as their religious enforcement agency, the way the world ignored and then suddenly fears time travel\u2026 it\u2019s all very, very smart. This is not a book where the sci fi technology exists in a vacuum and only pops up when convenient. These characters have been living in this world their whole lives, and it shows.The big bad guy is a lunatic, and at times he goes a bit over the top, as if to sell his psycho-ness, but it doesn\u2019t really detract from the story at all (in fact, it helps sell other characters\u2019 motivations). The supporting cast is very good and no one feels like they only exist to serve a function, which is nice in this kind of story.If you want to read the book and enjoy it without my opinions tainting it for you, stop reading now and just go buy the book. Nothing below this point is really important. I promise.UPDATE: Read Storrs' response to the second part of my review, which pretty much negates all I say below: http://blog.timesplash.co.uk/2010/08/...Now for the part of reviewing I hate. The book isn\u2019t perfect, but I can\u2019t say it was the book\u2019s fault so much as my own prejudices. Here\u2019s the thing: the protagonists are very, very young. Sandra, a timesplasher\u2019s \u201cbitch\u201d in the first chapter, goes from 15 to 17ish over the course of the book. Jay, a timesplash fan-turned-secret agent, is only 19 when things kick into gear. To me, the two years between the first events and the rest of the book seem too brief for Jay to have gone from half-assed punk to an even semi-capable law enforcement officer. And even so, I can\u2019t wrap my mind around the fact that these two are in charge of saving the world.Here\u2019s where I go off the rails, because these things get into my brain in all the wrong ways. I don\u2019t have a problem with Sandra being 15 and then 17. I mean, it\u2019s a bit young for my tastes (given the things she does in the story), but then I have a teenaged assassin in Arkady and Kain, so obviously I\u2019m not one to criticize. But then you have Jay, who really seems to me should be an early-20s character, say five years, six years after the first chapter, grappling with the demons he witnessed when he was still a kid. But instead, he\u2019s STILL a kid, somehow playing in a grown-up world, and every time he engaged with his superior officers in the story, I got this nagging feeling we were slipping into inauthenticity. It seemed like the training he\u2019d go through to join M15 would have to take more than two years to complete, no matter how brilliant he might be (and he never comes across as especially brilliant). And every time I was about to let it go and just enjoy the story, there was some mention of either Jay or Sandra being a teenager, and I got sucked right out.So then I started wondering who Graham Storrs was, because (and I mean this in a nice way, honest) stories where teenagers take on adult roles like this tend to be written by teenagers. But Storrs isn\u2019t a teenager at all, so that theory fell apart. There was just something off about it\u2026 it\u2019s not that teenagers CAN\u2019T save the world, they\u2019d just have to do it from the outside, not as part of a serious intelligence agency. In the very real world of this book, it seems jarring that this kind of rule would be ignored. Old people don\u2019t like young\u2019ns, and they hold them up as much as possible I obsess on strange things, I know. No other reviewer was bothered by this, so you don\u2019t need to listen to me at all. I just wanted to mention the one thing that bugged me. Well, that and the fact that every time a gun was used, we got its make and model. That happens in all kinds of stories, and I still don\u2019t understand it.So yes. TimeSplash: good book. Buy it, read it, love it, and tell me how silly I am."}, {"userName": "Sean Randall", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1352386-sean-randall", "userReview": "I was hooked before I even got the book, the description alone appealed enormously. And I was about as undisappointed as it's possible to be, because this thrill ride of a book kept me going like the sugar rush from a kilo of chocolate on an empty stomach.First, these debut novels, especially those published small time on Kindle are often full of errors (spelling, grammar, continuity, the works). This is far from; Storrs is practically impeccable (Jay was called Jake once in chapter 24) but that's pretty much the only thing to set my proofing nose atwitch.What stood out, then? The international quality of the work comes to mind, not just in the official team at the TCU but in the Splashers as a group. There's a great deal of localization: Brussels, Berlin, London - but there's also an extraordinarily wide net of characters represented. Where the locale-specifics were employed, they were employed well, right down to the Geordie's manner of speech, that of the London cabbie, and Bauchet's diction, when he gets riled: an author who can manage to give you a sense that the tech he's talking about impacts the whole world so well, yet focuses so accurately and carefully on specifics at the same time scores major points with me.The structure of the work also appealed; each part felt right in terms of length and scope: they built on each other, adding to what had gone before whilst helping to show the passage of time and progress of the characters lives and the underlying technology. We weren't spoon-fed detail, but there was enough given so that you could easily follow - a balancing act often flubbed but executed here with magnificent aplomb.There were little bits throughout that really caught my eye, too. The intense and terrifying end of chapter 3. Bauchet's authoritarian outburst in chapter 8. Jay's great discovery in chapter 9. Then there's Sniper's epic outpouring in chapter 15 which really starts to show his grip on reality is well and truly crumbling.And then, as we move into the final act, which I suppose is really encapsulated in chapters 22 through 26, the action really kicks into high gear. The race is on, the splash is coming, the mole shows his fangs and it's all or nothing for our heroes in a great swelling bulging warped London of the past.And, as if the tension and drama and action and excellently written prose isn't enough, as if the comic banter between the leads wasn't quite injecting the right note to keep a serious situation easily readable, as if the picturesque descriptions, imagery and dialog of the era, so apart from the \"now\" of the work wasn't captivating enough: there's the target. the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, in fact, because the viewpoint of the whole thing switches to the target's perspective, just for those 19, 20 paragraphs or so - that really works, you know? Hell of a weird shift, sounds bonkers, but it fits and more than that it really fits, slots into place, gives the scene a surreal yet painfully vivid reality. A sharpness, yet an innocence, it makes the entire denouement work in a brilliantly satisfying way that left me dry-mouthed with the sheer pace and bravura of it all. Were I to tender one literary criticism, it's that the last chapter should've been an epilogue. I can't quantify why I think that, it was just my feeling at the time.This book only cost me \u00a33.29. The eBook was DRM Free from the Kindle store, print is also available from Amazon and an audiobook is similarly priced, both at Audible and an indi publisher without any DRM and in the format of your choosing. I enjoyed every chapter, every page, every sentence. You've got no excuse not to pick it up; no \"I can't read it on my device\" or \"it's not available in audio\" or \"I can't Braille it\". The only thing it'll cost you to read is a few bucks, the price of a relatively good sandwich and a cup of coffee. My advice? Make a pot, sit back with the book however you read it, paper, audio, synthetic, Braille. Get into it, let yourself go and allow the world to unfold in your head. You won't be sorry. If this book isn't in my top 5 reads of 2012, my top 3 even, then I've died and someone else is compiling the list."}, {"userName": "Gerold Whittaker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2570518-gerold-whittaker", "userReview": "The premise behind the science is that the present cannot be changed by altering the past.

I downloaded Graham Storrs\u2019 Timesplash through a free offering on Amazon.It\u2019s 2047, and the world has changed. Big time. There\u2019s been a worldwide depression, coined \u201cThe Great Adjustment\u201d, and young people have found a new form of entertainment \u2014 time travel. Timesplashing has become the rave parties of the future. The \u201cbricks,\u201d or time travellers, are \u201clobbed\u201d into the past to create a paradox; say, killing your own grandmother before you were born. I know, sick, right? No, not the \u201csick\u201d my teenagers use to describe a new video game \u2013 the boring, old-fashioned sick. The timeline always smooths itself out and history is never changed so no harm, no foul, right? Not quite.What do the splash partiers get out of it? After the deed is done and the bricks yanked back to the present, the fun begins. The drug-fueled splash partiers get to experience the backwash, where time and space shift in the present while time rights itself. The bricks become rockstars \u2014 picture Guns \u2018n Roses in the 80\u2032s or The Rolling Stones in the \u201970\u2032s.While timesplashing is illegal, \u201cthe man\u201d doesn\u2019t really worry about it too much \u2014 until it starts being used as a tool for terrorism and whole cities begin to crumble in the backwash. As technology advances and the bricks are lobbed further and further into the past, devastating paradoxes erupt in the timeline resulting in the annihilation of the present.Mr. Storrs has wrapped a political thriller, love story, and sci-fi novel into one neat package. Throw in espionage, a depraved psychopathic brick bent on becoming a timeplashing legend, and insecure young love \u2014 voil\u00e0! \u2014 you have Timesplash.The main protagonists, a young couple in over their heads and haunted by their pasts, set out to stop a plot to destroy a major european city. Their determination and bravery, despite self-doubt, insecurity and fear make them easy to connect and sympathise with.This book is fast-paced and gritty. There is a good share of violence, balanced by a very sweet, innocent love story. The characters are engaging and likeable (or hate-able), the narration and dialogue edgy and real. I could almost hear those British accents we Americans love so much.Although there was quite a bit of technology discussed, (It is sci-fi, after all. I hate it when people complain about having to read about science and technology in a sci-fi novel) it didn\u2019t overwhelm or bore me. Mr. Storrs does not go into a lot of Post Adjustment political detail, but the hints thrown in here and there are intriguing. I can definitely see global politics ending up exactly where the author places it in Timesplash.I really enjoyed this book \u2013 especially the actual timesplashing scenes \u2014 I wish the author could have woven a few more of them in throughout the book. All sci-fi/time travel fans should add Timesplash to their collection and keep Mr. Storrs on their watch list."}, {"userName": "Monique Atgood", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8262462-monique-atgood", "userReview": "This is sci-fi with a vengeance. Rich kids would have \u2018splash\u2019 parties, where they would do drugs, and send someone back a few years in a time machine. The time travelers would be gone under an hour. While they were in the past, they would commit as much destruction and mayhem as possible. They would murder their own grandmother when she was a baby, shooting everyone in sight, that sort of thing. The time lines always righted themselves, and it was like the \u2018bad\u2019 events never occurred, BUT the area around the time travel cage would turn into a PCP like weird land, called the \u201cSplash\u201d.Then they figured out the farther back you go, and the more trouble you cause, the bigger the splash. Finally, someone went too far and a lot of people got killed. Then a whole city was wiped out. Suddenly stopping time travel terrorists became policy number one for governments everywhere.This is the story of how one rich kid, went from being a \u2018splash\u2019 kid high on drugs, trying the latest fad, to being a super cop and saving Europe from time traveling terrorists. CONS:It was written by an Australian, so they have ideas about romance with \u2018jail bait\u2019 that would earn you ten years in prison in Florida. Getting over that hurdle was a bit strange.You also have to do some translating, since it\u2019s written in \u2018English\u2019 English, not \u2018USA\u2019 English, (nothing ethnocentric going on here!!) but actually, that makes it more fun. I actually had to go to urban dictionary for a definition.I thought the evil character \u201cSniper\u201d was too revered. Anyone could have taken his place for the terrorists, so they didn\u2019t really need him. The tech who provided the ways and means for the time travel was the person whom I felt the story should have centered upon. But then again, Sniper was outrageous and crazy and really entertaining, which is all we expect from a book right?PROS:The novel was fresh and exciting. It was hard to put down.The characters were truly alive. They leap out from the pages and grab the reader by the throat, shaking them by the collar and demanding to be devoured and enjoyed.

Then time travelling hit the mainstream and became the ultimate terrorist weapon. Scarred by their experiences with time travelling, Jay and Sandra are thrown together in what is to become the biggest manhunt in history: the search for Sniper, Sandra\u2019s ex-boyfriend and a notorious terrorist.Set in the near-future, the novel is action-packed, full of political intrigue and a sprinkling of romance. Look out \u2014 science fiction is far from dead!TimeSplash is highly ambitious in its scope, and the key to its success is Storrs\u2019 intriguing take on time travel, which is integrated seamlessly into the storyline, avoiding the off-putting technicality of so much science fiction. In short: people can be \u2018lobbed\u2019 back in time for short periods, only to be eventually yanked back to the present. While you\u2019re in the past, you cannot change the timeline \u2014 well, not permanently. You can go back and kill your mother, creating a temporary paradox, but the timeline will smoothen out and return to its original state. The problem is, the mess caused by that paradox will follow you home and wreck destruction on the present. Add some time travelling addicts into the mix and you have a recipe for disaster.Despite such a fascinating premise, TimeSplash is ultimately a very human tale about finding bravery through fear, and never giving up. Jay, Sandra, and the host of other (mostly European) characters are vividly portrayed: you cannot help but empathize with their plights, including when it comes to the villains. It certainly helps that the settings were so strongly evocative, particularly the scenes in London \u2014 living in London myself, there was a pleasurable thrill in reading about places I have visited.In sum, highly recommended for science fiction and thriller enthusiasts alike, and even those undecided."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4153058-peter", "userReview": "Readers,So, time travel is it possible? Sure is a favorite theme in science fiction. Especially what would happen if a person returns to the past, can that change the future.Well, Storrs proposes that one cannot change the past. What happens is that a temporal displacement takes place, like throwing a stone into a still pond. The ripples flash out, but given enough \"time\" haha, the pond will return to itself. So in his premise, a time splash occurs, causing ripples that affect current time, yet the past doesn't change.So the story begins with the fact that youths attend a party where a timesplash will occur. Some bricks - the people traveling in time, are lobbed into the past. The ripples of their effect in the past affect the party goers, who under alcohol and drugs get a wild ride.Until the technicians are able to send bricks back over 60 years. The splash causes actual physical destruction in the current time-frame. All of a sudden the technology has a terrorist application. How will the world protect itself. What if the techs can send people back even further? What damage does that cause the current time frame?Storrs tackles these various issues and gives us a few memorable, yet predictable characters to hang onto during his pursuit of a conclusion. From a pure fictional exercise it is a nice simple book to enjoy. The deeper science and philosophical issues are glossed over.

The description doesn't go into a lot of detail, but basically there are 'bricks' (people) who are lobbed back into time, making a 'splash'. Then someone gets the idea to kill an important person in history, and the manhunt begins. Pretty good plot, right?I'll agree that the plot was intriguing - however, for me, the sci-fi aspects of the story were more believable than the characters. I didn't care for Sandra's character at all. She was an insecure teenager (14 years old when the story begins) and basically looking for a man to take care of her. A couple of years later, she's still insecure, but has transformed into someone with the skill set of a highly trained anti-terrorist operative after spending two years in a mental institution. Not likely. Jay, who actually is a highly trained operative, was more likeable, but made decisions like the 19-year-old that he is.Although I enjoyed the actual story and it was well-written, it was a little confusing at first because of the multiple POV's - a lot of characters to keep straight, and I felt like more of the focus should have been on the time travel aspect rather than pages of police procedure. The action sequences were exciting and the pacing, for the most part, was good.

The first few chapters were gripping.Storrs juggles a lot of characters in this book but the vast majority are well rounded and memorable. I loved the concept of the rockstar bricks (don't want to include any spoilers in this review), but Storrs brought in serious character flaws to prevent stereotyping. He has a talent for well-written action scenes and definitely brought the past alive, especially London in the final chase sequence. Enormous fun.There were a few points where I felt the world history heavy-handed, put there for the reader, rather than it naturally flowing from the dialog. Not a show stopper, especially since Storrs' future timeline is intriguing and very believable. Maybe he's a prophet as well? :)Also, he introduces a character at the beginning that is an overpowering foreshadow of the end, especially as that character doesn't reappear until the end.The chief reason I rate it at a 3-star is that this book is really heavy with police procedural, so much so that the pace crawled in places, for my taste. I would have preferred more time spent on the science-fiction and especially the time travel. All the detective work was well realized though and highly believable, there's just so much of it.

After a friend of Jay's dies at a timesplash gig, he becomes a policeman who is seconded by interpol to try and stop the terrorists. He is added by Sandra, the beautiful ex-girlfriend of the chief timesplasher Sniper. From the start of the novel I was drawn in and the tension continued for it entire length. The novel travelled the world and, with my limited knowledge, that world seemed real. I was interested to read that Graham Storrs lived in London where much of the novel is set. It reminded me of a James Bond type spy thriller set a few decades into the future. Perhaps the one quibble I had was the dialogue, which sometimes seemed more last century, than the way they might talk in mid-21st century. This was the first ebook I have read. I read it on a Kindle which unfortunately malfunctioned towards the end, so some of my concentration was taken from the words and place on what the Kindle was doing. I had to get the Kindle replaced to enable me to finish reading the story. I would recommend Timesplash to anyone in the mood for a fast paced adventure thriller. I reckon you don't have to be into science fiction, like I am, to enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Nick Turner", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11097748-nick-turner", "userReview": "Australian horror story. There is some shallow comparison to sci-fi action movie Jumper, but with high technology providing a visit to the past rather than a natural ability to teleport through space. Supposing that the present is the best possible world and that any change would be horrifying, and supposing unlikely continuity of timelines after time travel, visiting the past puts timelines out of whack, temporarily, if you kill a celebrity dead White man. As the timelines spring back to the best possible world (history), horrific timesplash phenomena can be observed. When the visits are to the near past, the timesplash seems to die down after a short time and not affect the present when the time traveller is pulled back. The possibility that visiting the past could be used for any positive purpose isn't explored by this work. As underground hackers race to jump the furthest back, more extreme splashes are observed; even effects in the present. I liked how relationships were testy and subject to misunderstandings.\tTimesplash effects were described mechanistically. There is a lot of telling of doom but not enough showing of the personal effects in the lives' of ordinary individuals. I read a review copy from the publisher."}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3696663-kerry", "userReview": "I liked how Graham Storrs worked out the mechanics and physics of time travel in this novel. He nicely resolved the implications of messing with the past. Set in Europe of 2050, the world of TimeSplash is mostly familiar but with subtle twists. Everyone's got a \"compatch,\" which seems to be what cell phones have evolved into. Terrorists use time travel as a destructive tool, funded by unnamed deep pockets (possibly the government of the United States, which has been taken over by religious zealots). I wasn't as much a fan of the cartoonish characters. For some reason, the misogynist Sniper could have been the deranged twin of Zaphod Beeblebrox (from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the GalaxyOverall, a fun read for the plot and less so for the characters."}, {"userName": "Damali", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2776346-damali", "userReview": "All the cool kids are doing it!The teenagers have discovered time travel, and the farther they go back in time, the bigger the splash -- the distortions that happen to the environment in the current time. They have parties where they drink and drug, and wait for the splash. To produce a splash, they have to kill someone related to the splash team, in the past. The adults have too much going on to notice the time travel discovery until a very nasty splash occurs.Sandra and Sniper were part of a group of four doing a splash that has disastrous results. Jay was affected by the tragedy, and ever since then has devoted his life to track down those involved.Tthis was a pretty good story, but it's choppy, and has a few too many POVs for this type of tale. It probably would've been better if the author stayed on one POV for 80 pages, then switched, etc. I love the idea of the splash, but I wish more time would've been spent in the past, and better characterization.

I think this book was 4.5 stars. I had a hard time deciding between four or five stars. Ultimately, I went with four because the characters were a little two dimensionally and the climax went more or less as expected. That said, the writing was excellent and I really liked the concept. I'm not a fan of time travel. I don't like the multiple universe concept and the whole paradox issue otherwise kills it. The way the author treats time travel circumvents both of these concepts in a truly awesome way. Given that, this is another in a string of time travel stories I've really enjoyed. Maybe I'm a closet time travel lover.I highly recommend this book. I particularly love the fact that the story takes place all over the world, mostly in Europe. Not sure this is good or bad, but it feels a little like a book written to be a movie. It doesn't bother me and I think it would make an excellent movie, easily doable with modern CGI.

The author did a good job writing and planning out the science of his time travel. I also enjoyed all the pop culture names the timesplash kids picked for themselves. A tad bit of a spoiler: I do wish he'd left out the very brief side story of Linen's since having it at the beginning of the book is a bit of a spoiler. Plus it's confusing when a character gets two scenes at the beginning of the book and then absolutely nothing until the very end of the book. I think his two scenes should either have been edited out all together or they should have been moved to the end where they would have made more sense. Really they could have been left out all together though. It wouldn't have hurt the story at all."}, {"userName": "Balthazar Lawson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4372543-balthazar-lawson", "userReview": "In the future time travel is possible, if only for an hour or so. The problem is that there seems to be an auto correct installed in the time line and any changes made are corrected. However, the correction process can be rather violent and disastrous for the present and this is called a timesplash. It's so destructive that it's the weapon of choice for terrorists.This book is like most thrillers with the good guys trying to stop the bad guys from doing something very very bad. Of course it all comes down to the wire with time running out. Plus when there is the chance to just shoot the head baddy they don't take the shot.This is an interesting read and potentially a good series set in the future, where anything could happen."}, {"userName": "Adam Smith", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3514295-adam-smith", "userReview": "Time cannot be changed; it will struggle and reassert itself if you try; this assertion creates a wave of destruction that can be felt in the present. Now people can use time travel as a weapon; a deadly destructive force capable of destroying entire cities in the blink of an eye. This book is fascinating in its use structuring of time and space; any changes to the past create paradoxes that affect the present in waves of sheer destruction similar to earthquakes. It's a strange world where the invention of time travel is overlooked by greater financial concerns, resulting in the tech being used purely for sport. There were moments were it did feel like the story did drag a bit, but overall a great story following police attempting to stop time traveling terrorists."}, {"userName": "Beatrix Stolte", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7587061-beatrix-stolte", "userReview": "This book has some really great time travel concepts... gotta love them ripple effects! The future world created for this story is realistic and compelling. All in all TimeSplash is a pretty quick, but definitely satisfying read. Only thing I take a little issue with is the characters. They can seem a little... um... formulaic? Stereotypical, perhaps? The story still carries itself remarkably well despite these shortcomings.

I absolutely liked the concept of the book, as I'm a huge time travel fan. But as one reviewer put it, this was \"uninspired.\" After the initial description of the admittedly interesting time splash, the remaining first half of the book that I read just left me flat. Lots of talking, lots of conflict, lots of \"trying to catch the bad guys.\" I don't want to give any stars to this book without finishing it because I don't think that's fair.

Dean Koontz did it in Lighting, my all-time favorite time travel novel, and Graham Storrs does it in a completely different way in TimeSplash. Instead of writing around the inevitable paradox, he exploits it. I only started this book last night, but I read until sleep closed my eyes. I can't wait to see where the story goes.
