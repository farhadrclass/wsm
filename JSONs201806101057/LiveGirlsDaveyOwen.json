No wonder I loved it when I was 19! It's still pretty cool today. Set in once-squalid, now long-gone Times Square, LIVE GIRLS features a strip club filled with vampires both grotesque and alluring. Sure, it's corny, not all that well-written, but earnest and quick-moving, original and inventive. I suppose \"glory hole\" is something you'd never hear in either DRACULA or TWILIGHT. Oh well.

Wow! This is what Mass Market Paperback Horror is ALL about. Davey Owen is down on himself, down on his luck, and waiting for life's next kick in the balls when he pays a visit to a lurid place called, LIVE GIRLS. The beautiful seductress slinking behind the glass partition in the viewing room puts her teeth on him and changes his life forever.Yes, this is vampires, but man, oh man, this was a fucking thrill-ride. Filled with great characters, great villains, and paced to perfection, LIVE GIRLS explodes off the pages and leaves you very satisfied.

(I want to do the same with the Man Booker Prize, though that's even more insane). Too bad I kind of started on the wrong foot. I got this book because it was short-listed for Best Novel so I assumed it must be just as great as the winner novel Misery by Stephen King (which tied with Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon which I haven't read yet). Unfortunately, it wasn't.Let's start with the good stuff! It's a decent vampire novel with evil, selfish bloodsuckers as opposed to all those romanticized, pale vegan-vampires we have in lots of vampire novels nowadays. I prefer the evil version a lot more!The two main vampires Shideh and Anya were sexy, dangerous and ruthless and I liked that they could walk in daylight (Garton even explained that well) and were not invulnerable. What would happen to a vampire if he/she drinks \"poisoned\" blood was a great touch and actually one of the most creepy parts.There was a lot of sex in the story, pretty explicit at times, but when you write about a vampire-run peep-show and nightclub, I think that's unavoidable. Some of it was a little bit disgusting though (biting male patrons penises or sucking the menstruation blood out of someone, yuck).Now for the part why I didn't enjoy the book much: the main character.The male lead Davey Owen (how can you name your main character DAVEY? It sound like he's 5 years old) was just so weak and annoying! Half of the book he was whining about his job, his ex-girlfriend and life in general, friendzoning the female lead who did her best to make him feel better. Then he gets bitten by a vampire prostitute and then he keeps emphasizing how weak he feels, every five pages someone thinks how pale and sick he looks and how thin he got...And how exactly didn't he notice that Anya was a vampire? She bit your little buddy! TWICE! She makes you bite her and drink her blood! She's really pale and cold! You found an album of newspaper clippings from her dating back to the 1920s! And she looks still the same!And you're still wondering what's happening to you? Come on... It got better with Davey in the second half of the book (he manned-up) but I still couldn't warm up to him. The female lead, Casey, was okay though I didn't like how she played the emotional rubbish bin for Davey and hoping that he would fall in love with her someday. Benedek was the most interesting character for me. His sister got killed by vampires and he seeks revenge for that which was a nice plot point. The ending finally catched up on the action part and was pretty cool, but the 250 pages before that weren't thrilling me at all.All in all, it wasn't a bad vampire novel, but it wasn't a good one either."}, {"userName": "Craig \"NEEDS MORE DAMN TIME TO READ !!!!\"", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41311366-craig-needs-more-damn-time-to-read", "userReview": "Enjoyed this vampiric tale!

Let me start by saying, I loved this book, and I am going to read the sequel for sure. Now to get down to the nitty gritty: This is my version of a trashy sleazy beachy speed read book. I could have read this in one gulp while laying out in the sun, or perhaps on an airplane. Instead I powered through it in 2 nights, last night being wide awake at 2am blatantly refusing to put it down. Its a story! Plain and simple and down to the guts, it is an easy breezy BAD romance novel with GORE instead of glitter. There is no stylistic writing that hurts your brain to decipher, no metaphors or anything to hurt your brain meats. So, when I say trashy and sleazy, I mean there are some raunchy porn scenes that are pretty intense and bound to make you uncomfortable in public. I sometimes need a reprieve from the heavy stuff I normally need. And this was pure unalderated Fun, with a capital F. I enjoyed it, and that being said: it is not for everyone.  I am basically a reformed sewer rat. I do have supreme taste in literature, BUT I still can't help running straight back down to the sewer sometimes. I need my fix. This is identical to those 2-3am Taco Bell trips after a long night of drinking and dancing.

Garlic should do the trick! But seriously, this is my second book by Ray Garton and I enjoyed it so much that I finished it fairly quickly. What I really enjoyed about \"Live Girls\" is something that I'm hoping appears in all his work, which is the dark, truly horrifying portrayal of any monster that he deals with. This book is about vampires that are beasts, disgusting and seductive and horrifying. The story is based around a peep-show/club called Live Girls. It is one of two havens for vampires in the book. During the narrative, several people fall victim to its allure and its danger. I found myself breezing through the pages, curious and shocked by every event. One thing I will say about Garton is that I definitely could not guess the ending. Like \"Ravenous\" his werewolf novel, I was still left with questions... all involving backstory and details. Don't get me wrong, Garton fleshes his monsters out and gives you exactly what you need to turn the page...but damn...there seemed to be at least 3 types of vampires in the book and I wanted more DETAILS...yeah, I'm greedy.

A little perverse for me in certain parts and slow in the beginning but really picked up. Now I see what all the fuss was about. The main character is a writer named Davey Owen going through a crisis who get's himself involved in a peep show/ strip club in Times Square called \"LIVE GIRLS\" that happens to be run by...VAMPIRES!!! Real nasty, fanged, monstrous blood-sucking vampires! No romantic vampire bullshit here. A lot of people compared the premise of this book to the movie From Dusk Till Dawn. I prefer to compare it to the movie, Vamp...which is highly underrated in my opinion. Davey Owen was not a likable character in the beginning of the book, but he redeemed himself towards the end. And GR says this is \"Davey Owen # 1\". Does that mean there are more books, is this a series? According to Goodreads, this book is currently being made into a movie.

There was one Amazon reviewer who enticed me by saying something like, \"Nothing can prepare you for Live Girls. I went into this expecting to be shocked, and felt I was prepared. But nothing can prepare you for this\".Well, I went into this prepared to be shocked. It didn't happen.This was a pretty good story, though, and it is a novel that is driven by the story alone. That's the problem I have with a lot of horror lately. My favorite novels have all been heavily character driven. I need to reallycare about them and what they are pulled through to garner a high rating.Garton doesn't spend a lot of time developing his characters, but I have to say, it's impressive that the surface treatment he does give them saves them from being totally cardboard. He shows a fine economy of words.The dialog, however, I found to be very awkward. The exchanges between Beth and her abusive boyfriend reminded me of my struggled attempts at creative writing in grade 9.Live Girls is what it is, a fast paced vampire adventure. I guess if deep characterization is to take a back seat to story, then it's good that the story not waste any time and keep moving forward. And it does. I burned through it.I was just expecting more depth, and some real shocks. In the long run, I don't think it will take me very long to forget it, really.A two-star rating here translates to \"it was ok\", so 2 it is."}, {"userName": "Nicholas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/620575-nicholas", "userReview": "Along with Stokers' Dracula, Matheson's I Am Legend, Sturgeon's Some of Your Blood, King's Salems' Lot, Rice's Interview With the Vampire, Strieber's The Hunger, McCammon's They Thirst, and Lumley's Necroscope series (there, you've got my fave/top Vamp books) - I include this saucy, degenerate, nasty, thoroughly engrossing page turner as one of the pivotal moments in modern vampire lore.

People are found dead but their blood is missing. Dead corpses disappear from mortuaries. Ordinary, decent men keep returning to a certain seedy sex peep-show called Live Girls. The police know nothing and do even less.When Walter Benedek, a respectable, middle-aged reporter working for the New York Times, finds his sister and niece dead his world falls apart. He decides to spend the rest of his holiday looking for their potential murderer \u2013 his brother-in-law, Vernon. Vernon was last seen near Live Girls but Walter is strangely unwilling to go inside that establishment \u2013 he has a hunch and he is very healthily afraid. Still while hanging around he meets Davey, a young, naive assistant editor who doesn\u2019t hesitate to enter. Davey has been dumped by his latest good-for-nothing girlfriend and tries to enliven his life by looking for some new experiences. A visit to an obscure peep-show? Why not? Plenty of people do it every day, right?Soon enough Benedek and Casey, Davey\u2019s friend and colleague, notice the man is changing and not for the best. He is losing weight. He becomes unhealthily pale. He doesn\u2019t want to eat anything unless it is a piece of really rare meat\u2026and he can\u2019t stop thinking about Anya, the stripper that entertained him at Live Girls.What I liked:This book was first published in 1987 so exactly twenty-five years ago. Taking it into account I was surprised how fresh it seemed. The vampires tended to be of the older, Bram Stoker kind \u2013 beautiful but dangerous and rather unfriendly when it comes to the humankind \u2013 but it suited me fine. In fact the further a vampire is from the sick Twilight vision the better I like the book. I also appreciated the fact that the author balanced nicely the advantages and disadvantages of being a vampire. So yes, you can live far longer than humans but you are very allergic to garlic, you should avoid \u2018bad\u2019 blood (e.g. tained with drugs) and certain illnesses. There\u2019s no such a thing as free lunch, right?The pair of main protagonists (Davey and Cassey) were likeable enough but I must admit I preferred Davey (more about Casey in \u2018dislikes\u2019 section). He is a dynamic character with as many good as bad features. He is weak, he likes to play a hero and rescue different ladies who then exploit him and leave. He never notices and even if he does he wants to believe in his version of events \u2013 deluded and na\u00efve until he gets bitten one time too many. Let me also add that, showing Davey\u2019s unhealthy obsession Garton makes interesting points about why men let different \u2018vampires\u2019 (metaphorically speaking of course) drain themselves dry.Finally the whole world building was done in an interesting way. The two main female baddies, Shideh and Anya, were those beautiful, sexy, ruthless vampire beasts everybody loves to hate but for me the \u2018monster vampires\u2019, creatures which were foolish enough to drink \u2018poisoned\u2019 blood were the most interesting idea here and a great touch although also the most creepy. It is a horror story after all.There was a lot of sex scenes in the story, pretty explicit at times (hetero and lesbian) , but when you write about bad vampires who run a peep-show and a nightclub, I think that's unavoidable. Some scenes might be disturbing and even a little bit disgusting (erotic dance with a cross (mind you, performed by vampires, biting male patrons\u2019 penises or sucking the menstruation blood out of someone, yuck, but hey, if you remember 50 Shades you shouldn\u2019t be that shocked).What I didn\u2019t like:First of all let me tell you that it was sometimes very annoying how long it took Walter Benedek and Davey to recognize what they were dealing with. Nowadays, every person who watches TV and/or reads popular literature would cry \u2018vampire alert!\u2019 after just several pages. It was so plain obvious that almost funny but I don\u2019t consider it a real flaw. Once again you should take into account the age of this novel - I bet some of its adult readers are younger than it is. Reading it you only become aware that all these shows like \u2018From Dusk Till Dawn\u2019 or \u2018True Blood\u2019 do nothing more than refresh and copy, in a more or less successful manner, the old ideas. Perhaps painful but true \u2013 neither of contemporary authors has invented the vampires. Or anything else.What really got to me was the character of Casey. For an independent, strong heroine she was sometimes almost too stupid to live. An example? Casey finds out that Davey visited Anya again to have sex. She reproaches him saying: \u2018if you wanted to get a blow job you could ask me. You know I am clean.\u2019 Oh dear, girl, such an advanced stupidity should be punishable.First of all, you might be as clean as a virgin but Davey is most certainly not - I haven\u2019t noticed him using condoms and you know pretty well what company he used to keep, right? All of his ex- girlfriends were tramps to say the least of it, the fact that he played a white knight didn\u2019t mean he was also a monk. Now he\u2019s visited that stripper and you still think he didn\u2019t have any occasion to catch anything nasty? Secondly what respectable girl would offer something like that ? In your case it really sounded out of character. Ok, you can be a modern girl without inhibitions but still you are not a prostitute, right? Not yet, anyway (no, not telling more, it would be a spoiler). Finally, my dear, if you are such an experienced woman who can offer her friend oral sex in a very offhand manner you should have known as well that it is really not all the same who these services performs, at least not to Davey. He is the faithful one. Final verdict:A very steamy and gritty but surprisingly good horror vampire novel with just few mistakes. Old school but better than many contemporary clones. I always like it when an author takes a great number of commonplace myths about the vampires and turns them on their head. It was the nicest part of this read."}, {"userName": "John Bruni", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16694190-john-bruni", "userReview": "You know how vampires in modern fiction tend to be romantics and even erotic?
