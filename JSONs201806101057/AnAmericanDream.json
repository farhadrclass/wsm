Really groundbreaking work here, Norm. This novel follows the adventures of a renowned TV personality who, having had a little too much to drink at a party, receives instructions from the moon (in the voice of a woman) to kill himself. Naturally, we readers would hate for our white and wealthy male hero to kill himself, so we cheer the poor guy along as he seeks to reclaim his autonomy (his masculinity) by murdering the wife, sodomizing the family maid (she resists but then quickly relishes in the act), making the wife's murder look like a suicide, banging the maid again before the police arrive, tricking the cops, immediately falling in love with a sleazy nightclub singer, beating up her black boyfriend, and gifting her with her first real orgasm: all in under 24 hours. Just another day in the life for the Mailer male, I guess. Not a lick of humor or satirical depth alleviates the obvious repulsiveness of this all (but our hero does respect black men as being men, and he wants to believe that a good woman surely exists in the world), but instead Mailer wastes page after page with pseudo-New Age nonsense about lunar energies, thought projectiles, personal demons, as well as the ability to impregnate a woman in just one try (the woman can tell she's pregnant immediately because the sex was just that fucking on point). Mailer tries to spruce this all up with a heightened prose style, which entails endless run-on sentences composed of throwaway imagery, pulpy narration, and vapid interior whining. The \"pulpiness\" is the only redeeming quality of this book, and if Mailer hadn't decided that his neurotically misogynistic bullshit was the stuff of high art, he may have been a pretty good crime writer; he certainly can write dialogue for tough-guy cops. As someone who loved the brisk, testosterone-driven prose of Hemingway as a reader aged-18, I wonder if this book or any of the other of Mailer's \"Men with Dicks\" lit would have struck a similar chord at the time? I pray to the murderous moon goddess in the night that this isn't the case."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "[and sodomises (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "brian   ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian", "userReview": "ah... mailer at his worst. throwaway prose, boring characters, obvious plotting and tired themes (amongst mailer's 'important' themes is the whole american masculinity/infantliazation thing that hemingway did with considerably more force and thought a few decades earlier). at his best, mailer is a god. at worst - as is evident here - he's not fit to write a cheap pulp novel."}, {"userName": "Ben Loory", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/171197-ben-loory", "userReview": "should be subtitled a book of smells. never read so many smells in my life. all of them bad. seriously, either mailer has the most sensitive nose on the planet, like a bloodhound-level smeller, or this is some really weird experimental thing where all the emotional interactions are couched in terms of theoretical odors given off by people on a second-to-second basis? does this exist?

On the one hand, it's well written and rife with promiscuity, devious sex, murder and booze. All of which sort of kicks ass. On the other hand, Norman Mailer has succeeded in writing a story that actually made me wish there was LESS testosterone and more actual insight. (Yes I know that the beatniks didn't write to provide insight, they just wrote matter-of-fact-ly and made a mark by letting the readers find their own insight, but fuck that. The beatniks can suck it. Oh, and On The Road sucked.)The main character is a German-stomping war hero, a former college football star, a former Senator, a TV talk show host, a close friend of JFK and an existential philosophy professor. You know, your typical Average Joe. But wait, it gets better. He murders his wife (who he says is sucking the life out of him but makes no noticeable effort to explain how), is called a sexual 'genius' after he has anal sex with the maid, sleeps with another woman and gives her her first orgasm, drinks like a fish, fights like a drunk and stares down police officers and professional boxers with naught but his toughness. His father in law thanks him for murdering his daughter, and then he beats his father in law in the head with an umbrella. In the end, he drives to Las Vegas, wins a shitload of money and flees to Mexico to evade the law. This book could be seen as tongue in cheek, an ironic glimpse into a twisted 'American dream' of roided-up masculine fantasies, except for one major problem, MAILER STABBED HIS WIFE IN REAL LIFE. So the dude tries to kill his wife and then writes a book about getting away with murdering your wife. Right. Real tongue in cheek there Norman.It's a masturbatory fantasy and nothing else. With every word that Mailer writes he is jerking himself closer and closer to climax until at the end of his fantasy all you can picture is a walking, talking, throbbing vein-bulging erection occupying the pages of the book. Even given all of that, I'm still giving it 3 stars, because after anally violating his wife's maid, which she loves, he demands that she take a shower. He then sleeps with another woman without actually showering himself. In fact, he does not take a shower for the remainder of the book. Which is sort of gross and hilarious."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88295-michael", "userReview": "An utterly ridiculous, oftentimes despicable novel. Its greatest merit is that it is short. Offensive attitudes toward women (as is true of pretty much all of Mailer), toward the underclass, toward sex and violence, toward everything. Ugh. But compulsively readable. And, if its title is taken to mean anything, this violent, soft-porn soap opera of a novel is intended as a portrait of America's dream of itself in the mid-sixties, and its hero someone males of the time might secretly aspire to be. Though here, of course, Mailer takes every cliche of spy fiction, thrillers, soft-core whatever, and blows it out of proportion to make it all near pornographic. If this is the American dream, we're a pretty sick country.That's the generous read of this. The less generous read is that Mailer's issues are the same as the novel, and that the title is a way to cloak those issues with a portentousness that will redeem the work. But whether or not Mailer is as guilty as the reader of the book, the title does call into question scores of assumptive behaviors from genre novels of the sixties, things people gobbled up without a thought. So it's either brilliant or repulsive though likely, being Mailer, a perfect mix of both."}, {"userName": "Carol Storm", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm", "userReview": "If you can stomach the brutal violence and the hysterical anti-woman diatribes, Mailer actually makes some pretty good points about racial, sexual, and cultural hypocrisy in America. He knows how to write tough cops and the sordid underbelly of big city America.

I've had it on my shelf for four years, and I was really excited to finally read a full-length work by the late, great Norman Mailer. To cushion the review I'm about to give, let's just put some things into perspective (facts I myself only looked up after reading the book and seriously disliking it): this particular novel, his fourth, was actually initiated as a series of installments in Esquire magazine. Now that I know this, I'm somewhat more forgiving about the profusion of misogynistic sex, heteropatriarchal myopia, and manipulative, promiscuous women who permeate the book. (But isn't that also a sad thing, to learn a book like this was published in Esquire in the 1960s, and then be able to say, \"Oh, well, all that makes more sense then\"?)I also have a feeling that my reasons for disliking it might pertain almost solely to women and extremely sensitive/feminist men. So maybe don't bother reading this if you're a guy who plain likes graphic sex, violence, wealth, and intrigue; you might think this book is swell. And, let's keep in mind, I'm usually totally enthralled with sexual deviance and graphic sex as literary themes.Now, on the one hand, I do understand that this book is intended to be satirical in the extreme, and so a lot of the really problematic portrayals of racialized and female characters should probably be read with a slant in mind. That said, intention only gets you so far.In the most basic sense, I was so distracted with the egregious unlikability of absolutely every character in the book that I only pushed myself through to the end of it in the hopes that the conclusion would rectify pretty much everything. While I won't spoil what happens, I will say that it didn't change my opinion at all. What we have here is a dystopic, rich New York City of the 1960s. Wealthy and quasi-famous professional kills supposedly crazy and pernicious wife, Deborah (although, since we only have her perspective from people who seem to hate or fear her, we don't really know very much about her). I think the first half, when Stephen, our narrator, is staring down the barrel of criminal arraignment, is more interesting; in those scenes, we see his utter vulnerability and his insanity.It's not long after until he skirts the protocol of the entire criminal justice system, is free on the streets, and \"falls in love\" with a lounge singer who he met just moments after staging his wife's death. He becomes obsessed with Cherry, and Cherry, like Ruta, the maid who Stephen nails just after murdering his wife, and Deborah, has a long history of sleeping with dangerous men who think very little of her for the sake of social status.There are various rendezvouses with Cherry's exes, cops, and Deborah's mourners, scuffles in bars, and generally a lot of drinking and lunatic streams-of-consciousness. The plot just becomes increasingly less believable, and the writing itself is sometimes beautifully imagistic, but sometimes dense and verbose. I finished this book and felt like it was little more than the pathetic ravings of a petty, weak, overprivileged white man."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "\u201cTwenty five whores in the room next door, twenty five floors and I need more\u2026\u201d Sisters of Mercy \u2013 Vision Thing.If there is a dream then, according to the law of opposites, there should be a counterdream\u2026 Can reality be considered as a counterdream?

To do this, he commits a series of violent and insane acts, in an alcoholic haze; challenges sent him by the moon (really) whose successful completion might give him a hint of the freedom he dreams is beyond the neon-lit tarp of the Manhattan skyline. This pilgrim's progress is nothing short of an obscene fantasy, wherein our hero, a decorated war hero, former congressman and talk show host, strangles his maddening estranged wife, buggers the German maid, steals a Mafia Don's girl friend, and proceeds, in 24 hours, to lie and deceive the New York City Police Department, the Mob, with intimations that the FBI and CIA are involved invisibly in the mess he created. The plot, of course, is lurid, absurd and the product of a particular time, but Mailer's novel comes at a time when the Hemingway cult of quiet, manly stoicism managed through a singular, privately held code of honor was exhausted of compelling narrative potential. Mailer\u2019s idea was to see what would happen if the man who might have been the Hemingway hero, suffering his hurts in some poetic privacy, had instead a psychotic break."}, {"userName": "Ugh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh", "userReview": "A book that's hard to categorise and hard to quantify.

It's an intoxicating, at times breath-taking work. Parts of it no doubt went over my head, as sometimes almost entire paragraphs of mind-wandering passed me by, but I still found it one hell of an impressive acheivement.

Here, the will is king; outside of morality, of destination, of thought. There is some gloriously described psychopathic sex early on. Here Mailer runs rampant and with much relish decimates the female flesh. Steady on, Norman! Everything of note plotwise happens in a vomiting ejection at the beginning of the novel. This leads to the reader chasing echoes, wandering through aftermath looking for an anchor which Mailer is too spent to set for us.The grandiosity of language is something to behold and justified as a method to convey a very direct representation of character. There is an attempt to bring the world of psychoanalysis and Freud into the equation. This, however, is largely unsuccessful and only emphasises the lack of anything but a superficial insight. The reflections on devotional religiosity embolden the allusions to unrestrained inner forces searching for outwards justifications.I couldn't help but think that Mailer was doing a great deal of zeitgeist chasing. There are constant ticks and shorthands that may have been relevant to the time, though '65 may have been a little late for some of this stuff, but is grating and vacuous. I can see I need to read more Mailer, who is extraordinary stylistically. Not sure if I like the bombast enough to call it anything but a bluff, albeit an invigorating and amusing one.

The result is a psychological thriller with complex themes. What effect does incest have on the victim over time? Does it increase their capacity for utter cruelty? Are we all capable of unspeakable acts of violence if pushed far enough? This book was met with great controversy when it was written. Mailer was not exactly known as Mr. Nice Guy and his reputation with women shadowed him his entire life. However, like all Mailer's work, there is a thread of brilliance and insight in this book that makes it a harrowing read. Unlike some readers who seemed focused on the \"filth\", I found the story to be an excruciating exploration of the human quest for signs and indicators. It is also a story of resilience and the desire most of us have to keep going - no matter what."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1935343-andrew", "userReview": "This is the first Norman Mailer I've read. It took me a short while to get into it, but once the character really kicks in then the book takes off at a fast and realistic pace. Stephen Rojack is surface-successful, but underneath burns disatisfaction and disgust. After impulsively killing his estranged wife, he is plunged into a couple of limbo days, where casual connections and the promise of a new love mix his emotions into a potential cocktail of sex and violence. The book blurb suggests these scenes are graphic and shocking, but whilst they are vivid and realistic the book is shot through with poetry and intense descriptions which means they are never salacious. More triumphant, in fact. As a dissection of man's preoccupations and disatisfactiosn - even when moneyed and famous - An American Dream is a tour de force of ambition. It begs re-reading and is as fascinating as a car crash.

I did, however, think it was a good read and found his hallucinatory writing to be both heady (chalk full of strange Freudian/jungian interplay) and capitvating in style.

The author's success is his ability to portray the characters at their raw elements in a riveting and imaginative language. Hero of the novel Stephen Rojack hovers on the edge of sanity when not drunken. Other characters are driven by power, money, lust and superstition. The author explores the underbelly of New York society with a brutalness and delves deep into the psychology of a criminal. When Stephen takes a walk on the parapet of a thirty story building, the reader is left hovering on the edges of a deep abyss of madness on one side and the terrace of sanity on the other side. The unanswered questions as to why the american dream talk only of deviant people lingers. Maybe the novel reflected the times of a disillusioned post war America where a beautiful dream turned into a horrible nightmare - a second World War hero with a Distinguished Service Cross becoming a murderer on the verge of lunacy. And the moon, ' a silvery whale, princess of the dead' also plays a minor role in the narration which is powerful, gripping and raw."}], "description": "Stephen Rojack is a decorated war hero, a former Congressman, and a certified public intellectual with his own television show. He is also married to the very rich, very beautiful, and utterly amoral Deborah Caughlin Kelly. But one night, in the prime of his existence, he hears the moon talking to him on the terrace of a fashionable New York high-rise, and it is urging him to kill himself. It is almost as a defense against that infinitely seductive voice that Rojack murders his wife.In this wild battering ram of a novel, which was originally published to vast controversy in 1965, Norman Mailer creates a character who might be a fictional precursor of the philosopher-killer he would later profile in The Executioner's Song. As Rojack runs amok through the city in which he was once a privileged citizen, Mailer peels away the layers of our social norms to reveal a world of pure appetite and relentless cruelty. Sensual, horrifying, and informed by a vision that is one part Nietzsche, one part de Sade, and one part Charlie Parker, An American Dream grabs the reader by the throat and refuses to let go.", "title": "An American Dream", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131793.An_American_Dream", "average": 3.46, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320403641l/131793.jpg", "reviews": 210, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7927.Norman_Mailer", "name": "Norman Mailer"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Literature", "Classics", "Novels", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131793.An_American_Dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/853465.An_American_Dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12060186-um-sonho-americano", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10993231-an-american-dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318495-an-american-dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1551774.An_American_Dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12467.The_Naked_and_the_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12468.The_Executioner_s_Song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/773971.The_Fight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12474.The_Armies_of_the_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12466.The_Castle_in_the_Forest"]}
