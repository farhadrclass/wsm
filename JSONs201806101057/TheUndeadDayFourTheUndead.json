This review will be for part 4 of the audiobook in which Howie and the gang leave Fort Spitbank, and pursue the women and children from Fort Spitbank onto the Isle of Wight.Zombie Darren meets a girl zombie, Marcy, who can also talk. This part of the storyline is getting so stupid. His rants and tirades aren't well written; they're just sweary. The zombie \"sex\" was embarrassing, and utterly unnecessary. I will continue with this series, because Darren is now dead - shot by Dave - and I'm interested to see Marcy in charge but I think I'll have a little break before starting the next one. This was a bit daft.The bits which were cool were really cool (e.g. Clarence throwing canisters of gas over the horde, and Dave shooting them to make huge bombs) but the parts with Darren were ridiculous, and elements of it (e.g. the church defence) seemed really similar to earlier parts of the story."}, {"userName": "Randy Harmelink", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029520-randy-harmelink", "userReview": "Once more, the dynamic of Mister Howie and Dave is just a fun romp in the zombie apocalypse. I liked the new characters introduced on this day. My only complaints would be that I thought there was more recap than necessary at the start, and I'm not real fond of the nature of the infection. But I'm definitely still willing to tag along for the ride."}, {"userName": "Darcy Leerhoff", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11009685-darcy-leerhoff", "userReview": "Completely awesome!"}, {"userName": "Dougal Matthews", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25833211-dougal-matthews", "userReview": "The stuff from the point if view of the infection is just weird.
