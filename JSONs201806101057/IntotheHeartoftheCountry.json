Holdstock has a very subtle way of detailing her contempt for how the English (and later the French) destroyed the Native Indian way of life. Or, it's the uglier side of colonization, or how colonization affected the native women and the children they bore for the English. The story briefly opens with Richard Norton taking a \"country wife\" and later ripping her son away from her to take him to England to become an English-boy. A cruel joke for the mother, the son (Moses Norton) and Richard who just leaves him there. A half-breed that will never gain the respect of the English and is shunned by his own people because he is never really able to be one of them. Later Moses returns as Governor of the fort and the story weaves back and forth between his daughter Molly and her husband Samuel Hearne. You see how the English destroyed their lifestyle, leaving so many unable to be English and many never to be fully accepted by their own people. I wrote down a few quotes that showed Molly's confusion and inability to be one with her own people. \"She was a stranger in her own country.\" \"She and her sister in their English dresses. Forbidden to play outside the walls.' \"You are an English woman Molly\". \"Sending her over to school her in the ways of her mother's people - ways she has always chosen to ignore.\" Molly never learns how to live off the land, and in the end cannot survive outside the fort, as many cannot when the English head back for home, leaving them behind. Holdstock is subtle but clear in writing how their lives unravel and from their intrusion in to their world, over-hunting for trade and now cannot live or survive the English sicknesses that are brought over. A very good book, just heartbreaking to read."}, {"userName": "Ruthie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991634-ruthie", "userReview": "An important slice of Canadian/British history, based on historical facts. There is a lot to like about this book, especially if the reader is interested in the history of the Indigenous Canadian people and how the arrival of Europeans affected their way of life. This story takes place well after the arrival of the first Europeans, the Indigenous people are used to trading with the English, have become dependent on guns and developed a taste for rum and brandy. The British men take (seemingly not forcibly) temporary wives, then leave them behind when they return to England. The religious aspect is not a factor here, there are no priests actively trying to convert anyone and the residential schools are not an issue either. My only concern was feeling a bit removed from the characters, I just didn't feel really engaged all the time. Otherwise an interesting read!"}, {"userName": "Koren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5807094-koren", "userReview": "Into the Heart of the Country is based on the life of Molly Norton, one of the daughters of Moses Norton, a half Native governor of the Hudson Bay Company\u2019s Prince of Wales Fort in Manitoba in the 18th century. Holdstock provides a fictionalized account of the lives of the fort\u2019s inhabitants and their relationships with one another, including the nearby Native American populations. The story opens at the end of Molly\u2019s life, and she recounts her life, her father\u2019s life, and her grandfather\u2019s life at the fort through her dreams as she starves alongside her children and family while journeying through the Manitoba wilderness. Looking back on Molly Norton\u2019s history, Holdstock goes back to a time when Richard Norton, her grandfather, was governor of the fort. Richard has children by different native women, and he takes his eldest child, Moses, away from his mother to educate him in England. Richard\u2019s English wife will have nothing to do with Moses, and he grows up lonely, longing for his home and his mother, while learning to be an Englishman. Moses continually struggles with his identity, not fully accepted by either the English, or the Natives, a struggle that Molly also deals with (though doesn\u2019t seem to be fully aware of it). This leaves him a bitter and tyrannical governor with a gluttonous appetite for drink and Native women who he keeps about himself. I would estimate that half of the book focuses on Moses Norton, and another large chunk focuses on Samuel Hearne\u2019s experiences at the fort. Molly appears once in a while, but she\u2019s definitely a supporting character for the majority of the book. For a book that is supposed to be chronicling her life, this is surprising.I did find it difficult to get into the story and care about any of the characters. I felt that I was \u201coverseeing\u201d the story unfold most of the time. The piecemeal nature of the book is distracting and confusing. Holdstock drops in new characters, leaving me wondering if they\u2019d showed up before and I\u2019d not noticed, but usually there was no mention of them again. Holdstock does a good job of relaying the turmoil felt by the people who straddle the races, and their uncomfortable position outside of the fort. The most engaging parts of the book are Molly\u2019s dream narratives, when she is actually speaking to the reader. The descriptions of the hunt for food, the group\u2019s struggles to survive, and the suffering of Molly and her children were heartbreaking. A terribly sad, heartrending story.

Here two cultures mingled and co-depended on each other, and when one was gone, the other one almost lost the ability to survive. It is a tragic story about human endeavours, dreams and their confrontation with reality.

If you like Louise Erdrich's books, you will love this one. Ms. Holdstock is a poet. I enjoyed Into the Heart of the Country in the way I did Erdrich's, The Plague of Doves--transported to another time and place through a compelling story, rich imagery, and lyrical sentences.Just one example of what I was captivated by, and why this book was long-listed for the 2011 Giller Prize:\"I have looked on this in all the long days and I have seen how the people were like seeds adrift across the land and blown by their hunger.\"Research is integrated seamlessly into the narrative. Ms. Holdstock is a masterful storyteller who brings alive the early days of the fur trade in the North-West wilderness of the 1700s. Ms. Holdstock tells the story of a native woman who is drawn into a white man's world and also gives us a glimpse of that white man's reality, so that we may understand both the heart of the culture that was destroyed and the lack of heart in the one that destroyed it.Molly, the native woman in this story thinks, \"The breath of the dogs in the winter air? I am less. I am less than the high white smears across the blue roof of the world. All my people starved and broken.\"\"Still, I am not tragic.\" First Nations author Lee Maracle wrote this line in a poem for a truth and reconciliation book called Buffalo Shout, Salmon Cry. Ms. Holdstock perfectly captures this truth: although the story of Indigenous people is ultimately tragic in the face of colonialism, the individuals who lived and continue to live that story are not.Indigenous stories are at the very heart of our identities. Books like The Orenda, The Plague of Doves, and Into The Heart of the Country tell us what First Nations people lost for us to gain the freedom that we enjoy."}, {"userName": "Girl Guides of Canada", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12180184-girl-guides-of-canada", "userReview": "An excerpt from one of our Girl Guides book club reviewers:\"Holdstock\u2019s writing is rich, detailed and at times poetic, but the tale she tells is burdened with tragedy and injustice making this novel a heavy read.

Appearing only fleetingly in the historical record of the Hudson\" s Bay Company are the Native women who lived at the company\" s Prince of Wales Fort and served as \" country wives\" to the European traders -- and whose survival was bound, for better or worse, to the fortunes of those men. Across more than two centuries, the mixed-blood woman Mary Norton, daughter of Governor Moses and personal favourite of the explorer Samuel Hearne, speaks to us from her dreams. As the story of her liaison with Hearne unfolds, we move toward its tragic consequences. When their small society is torn apart by a French attack on the fort, Mary and the other women find themselves and their children abandoned by their British masters. Now -- in one of history\" s cruel ironies -- they must fend for themselves in the harsh country from which their own ancestors sprang.
