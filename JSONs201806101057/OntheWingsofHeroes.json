He may well be my favorite author. His books are always full of heart-warming, side-splitting, illuminating, and page-turning details. I. LOVE. HIM. Okay, maybe not HIM, but his writing, for sure.I read this book in two days. Before you think I've shirked my motherly duties, let me say this: the book was a mere 148 pages. Easy to read half of the book after the chitlins have gone to bed. Especially when the read was such a good one.Davy is enamoured with his two heroes: his father and his brother, Bill. His father served in WWI and his brother, Bill, is flying bombers in WWII. Davy is still in grammar school, and is doing all he can to help with the war effort at home.I fell in love with his family. His dad was the big kid on the block and his mom catered to every need of her family. Bill and Davy, although several years apart in age, were so close. I love how Peck recreates history. When you read one of his books, you feel as if you're actually there, living it with the characters of the novels. I learned so much about life on the homefront during the war (\"the duration\"). There are so many things I gleaned from it that I couldn't retain from reading a textbook. Besides, the book was much more entertaining anyway. Additionally, he makes it FUN! I literally laughed out loud in several parts of the book, my favorite laughable character being Miss Titus (Peck describes her as being \"a dried-up woman with a face like a walnut...[she:] was small and stringy, though of course she could blow you away...Miss Titus was the oldest woman in the United States (and she had a mama?)...[she:] looked like a walnut with a mustache.\")Just another feel-good and hysterical novel from Richard Peck. If you've not read his work, start with A Long Way from Chicago and A Year Down Yonder. You'll read them in two nights for two reasons: they're short and they're GOOD! Then just go from there. You'll be a fan from the get go."}, {"userName": "Janet Ross", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2034894-janet-ross", "userReview": "This was sucha \"feel good\" story.

Davy Bowman's world is happy and safe because of his heroes, his Dad and his older brother Bill, who always seemed to find time to do things with Davy.Pearl Harbor is bombed and Davy's world changes. His Dad becomes the local air raid warden and Bill goes off to become a B-17 bombardier, flying missions over Germany. There are air raid drills and endless scrap drives. New kids enroll in Davy's school, \"eight-to-five orphans,\" whose mothers work at the local war plants. Everything is rationed, but the whole community pitches in to do their part for the war effort.Davy still has his heroes to depend upon but soon he begins to discover that in his neighborhood there are other heroes and during the next few years he learns what sacrifice and courage really means.In \"On the Wings of Heroes,\" Newberry Medal-winning author Richard Peck's easy-going pace and sly humor captures the sense of community in Middle America before and during World War II. Reading it stirred up millions of memories of my own childhood neighbors and escapades and also helped me to gain a deeper understanding of what my parents and older siblings had to endure during the war.It is an outstanding example of well written historical fiction that captures the heart and soul of families during war times, not only the wars of the past, but also the wars of the present. I highly recommend this book as a useful tool for teachers and counselors. I sincerely hope that grandparents and grandchildren, fathers and sons will also share this book. It is the beginning of discussion, of understanding, and perhaps even healing."}, {"userName": "Austen to Zaf\u00f3n ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029480-austen-to-zaf-n", "userReview": "Richard Peck is an amazing writer. Despite how short his novels are, he fleshes out interesting characters and hints at whole other stories attached to them. His historical detail is accurate, interesting, and often funny. This book is no exception. It takes place just before and during WWII in a small town. The main character is 11-13 and the story is told from his perspective. He gathers newspapers and metal for the war effort, learns to identify planes, and notices how the town becomes a place of only the young and the old as all the draft-age men leave and the women go to work in factories. Woven in are also details of life at that age: teachers, bullies, family issues. But what really shines through is the depiction of the main character's father, based on Peck's own father, a WWI veteran with a zest for life but also hidden sorrows and worry about his older son, in the Air Force. Peck never panders to young adults and while he doesn't go into detail about depressing or tragic events, he doesn't leave them out either. I thoroughly enjoyed this tender and funny story and Peck even managed to surprise me with some details about WWII that were new to me even though I've heard and read a lot about the era."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3948070-tatiana", "userReview": "On the Wings of Heroes by Richard Peck was trying much too hard at the start, and as a result, had a decidedly To Kill a Mockingbird vibe, complete with adult themes recounted from a child\u2019s perspective, the overwhelmed teacher, and upstanding father. It found its own voice eventually (and it\u2019s a short YA novel), and became the story of young Davy Bowman, his family, friends, and all those on the homefront in his town for the duration as Davy\u2019s brother, Bill, goes off to fight in the war, training to fly missions in a B-17 Flying Fortress, which is a cramped, heavy bomber aircraft, and I have personally walked through and explored one of them on several occasions. The brightest point throughout was Scooter\u2019s extensive knowledge of scrap metal, paper, and rubber equivalents to ammunition and plane parts. I also liked Miss Titus, just because. And the way Davy\u2019s dad dealt with the demons of \u201chis war\u201d was well-done, as it was informed with Peck\u2019s personal experience.If nothing else, this is a good historical fiction selection for 5th-6th grade boys to learn what boys their age did during WWII."}, {"userName": "Amy Brown", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72907-amy-brown", "userReview": "I don't read a lot of Richard Peck books and I'm not a big historical fiction person. But I really liked this book. Davy Bowman is growing up during WWII with a father who was a soldier in WWI and won't talk about his experience at all and a brother who is learning to fly planes. Each short chapter talks about Davy's life as he wishes for a Schwinn bike, collects various products for the war effort, gets into scraps as he adventures out with his best friend, and hopes that his brother will give him his letter jacket. There are worries that come with the war, one of them occuring later in the book when Davy's brother finishes his training and is sent to Europe. Overall a good book and one that teachers could use to help kids understand what life was like in the United States on the homefront during WWII."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833253-kimberly", "userReview": "This is my first Richard Peck book and I'm definitely looking for more! A wonderfully written coming-of-age story it starts when Davy is 10 or 11 before WWII and ends at the end of the war. It had the same general feel to me as To Kill a Mockingbird-- the child narrator with larger adult issues, neighbor characters, small town feeling, and strong father figure. I loved the characters and got goosebumps at the end. There are so many WWII books for YA out there but I feel like I now have a better idea of what it was like to grow up during that era and this book is the only one I can think of that connected the WWI his father fought in to the WWII his brother was in. A great book I will read to my kids!"}, {"userName": "Melody", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody", "userReview": "What a writer Peck is.

It stars Davy Bowman, a kid who holds his brother, Bill, and his father, Earl, very deep in his heart. They're are his heroes, hence the title. Davy and his friend, Scooter, love Halloween and Christmas. Although I can only really describe Scooter as his \"side kick\" friend to the best of my abilities. Davy's neighborhood in Illinois is gleeful, because almost every kid gets along and they have tremendous amounts of fun. Life is great for Davy until Pearl Harbor is hit, and his dad has to go to war, and Bill joins the Army Air Corps. Davy and Scooter decide to collect stuff for the war effort. One day while trying to collect milkweed. They go inside a barn and meet old Miss Titus. She's basically a grouchy old woman. However, while Davy introduced himself, she knew his last name without him telling her. He questions how'd she know that? What's she hiding?I think the idea of a kids perspective on certain events is a plot that could be well expanded on, and Richard did just that. This is a very well paced story with pleasing vibes to it. It shows how life can take a turn when it seems perfect, and with a topic like World War 2. There isn't a way to fix it. It's sad to think that you could loose to family members, even if it is to war. However, this book has a questionable character that I can't get over. Mr Stonecypher has a sob story, and that's it. I don't think he needed to be in the book. Richard wrote him to be thrown away and have no purpose.I would recommend this book to people that like serious books, but prefer to have little bits of humor sprinkled in."}, {"userName": "Keith", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1004303-keith", "userReview": "Peck is the master of the adolescent mind and allowing the reader to peer into it. Like his other books, the main character is young. The story speaks about his hopes and fears. The random daily adventures make for a marvelous page turner. This books is a quick read, and a great way to distract or ponder something outside of yourself. The setting is just before and during WWII.After some thought I have lowered my rating for one main reason. In his attempt at trying to show the dark side of some people, he has also decided to take upon his considerable talents of story-telling to take a stance against the BSA, and the military in general. I am not sure I understand the author's rational, but I find that several days after reading the story, the whimsical nature of it is lost to the dark trappings and negative view of these organizations.Peck is an amazing author, and the first of his books I read \"Far and away from Chicago\" I think is outstanding, even though it broaches similar topics. Thinking of the two books, I believe something has changed in the author's view. Unfortunately I do not align with his newer philosophy."}, {"userName": "Kaleigh Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66205765-kaleigh-kelsey", "userReview": "Richard Peck is one of my all-time favorite authors, and I was as delighted by this book as I was with the rest. It's a story of a young boy growing up during World War II. As the war is raging abroad, there are local battles taking place right in his home town. At school, in his family, with bullies, at his dad's work--everyone seems to be fighting something. This story was touching and funny. It was good entertainment but also taught important lessons.

This story takes place around/during a war in the 1940's era. It shows how a young boy practically worships his Dad and older brother. It illustrates rations and other rules made during war-time.

Davy's father was injured in WWI and thought his service would ensure that he would never have to send one of his own to fight in war. Well, he has to send his son Bill into WWII. Bill is Davy's hero.A sweet story of how middle America was effected by war. The rationing, the collection of materials to support the war effort. A very quick read.I loved the description of their teacher Miss Landis on p 75 \"She was real pretty, which helped with the boys but hurt her with the girls.\" and his description of her skills on p 76 \"Her manicure was better than her math.\" Of course there's a bully with her two henches (or wenches) that tortures the class and the teacher. But the new teacher (or perhaps resurrected teacher) teachs the bully a thing or two.My favorite quotes:p 20 Davy and his father were hiding in their car after setting a trap so that those who participated in \"pinning horns\" would have a great opportunity to be successful (windows rolled down, doors unlocked, but the unsuspecting criminal wouldn't see Davy and his dad hiding). Davy was pondering who might do such a thing. \"It was bound to be one of the Rogers boys, and I didn't want to be a witness. It wouldn't be Jinx, who kept his nose clean with his senior basketball season coming up. But there were several other Rogeres, all bad dreams.\"`p 36/37 When Davy is discussing the war slogan \"LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS\" that hung over his teacher, Miss Mossman's desk, \"If we knew miliary secrets, we weren't to tell anybody who could be a fifth-columnist, which was he wartime word for spy. I took this personally since I couldn't keep a secret.\"p 37 \"Every Thursday we brought as many dimes as we had for pink War Savings Stamps to stick in a booklet. When you had eighteen dollars and seventy cents, you traded the booklet for a War Bond. It would mature in ten years and be worth twenty-five dollars. 'I hope you children mature in ten years,' Miss Mossman said.\"p 38 Loved the story of Mrs. Meece and the rubber girdle she had to come claim during class as her son had turned it in to help with the war effort. Apparently, Mrs. Meece was a large lady and she needed it for her Eastern Star luncheon. Seems most of the kids just took things from home without asking.p 56 \"The problem with old people, as we were to learn, was that they always had a job for you.\"p 62 \"'Earl, you tell me what this war is for when you find out,' he said to Dad. 'You tell me what the last one was for.' The fire in his old eyes flared, but his head drooped.  \"Dad put his hand out on Mr. Stonecypher's sloping shoulder. He kept it there, and Mr. Stonecypher put his face in his old hands. There was a bad, shaky sound like a sob. \"'I wish I could tell you,' Dad said in a voice half his size. \"Mr. Stonecypher swallowed hard. 'You got through it, Earl.' He looked up, and his old face glistened. 'You may have been roughted up, but you came through and come back and had your life and your boys.' \"'I did,' Dad said, 'but a lot of the best ones didn't make it.'\"p 70 \"'Just so you know,' she said, 'that cake took two weeks' sugar ration.' \"'Sixteen ounces,' Scooter said. \"She gave him a look. 'You're the sharpest tool in the shed, aren't you?' \"He looked modest. Also, he had a buttermilk mustache. Miss Titus was real. \"'He's the smartest kid in our grade.'

This gentle home front story takes place in middle America, in a family like so many others at that time. Before the war, narrator Davy Bowman tells us, it was always summer, except when it was Halloween or Christmas. Summer meant exciting games of Hide and Seek with all the kids, including his big brother Bill and his dad, Earl, the biggest kid on the block. Halloween 1941, Davy is a cub scout who thinks he and his best friend Scooter could get one more year of trick or treating in before they were too old for it, and before the war took away all sweet treats. And that Christmas, Davy and Scooter both hope against hope to get the new shiny two tone cream and crimson Schwinn bike in the window of Black's Hardware. But then, Pearl Harbor is bombed and life changes for everyone.School is now overcrowded with \"Eight-to-Five Orphans,\" new kids from other places whose mothers are working in factories so no one is home during the day. Air raid drills are the order of the day, in case of an attack; scrape is being collected by all the kids; dimes are brought in to school once a week to buy war bonds; and Victory Gardens are dug and tended everywhere. And Davy's hero, big brother Bill, joins the Army Air Corps, causing his family to live a constant state of pride, fear and anxiety, which becomes unbearable fear when they receive the news that Bill went missing in action while flying a B-17 over the English Channel.As Davy takes us through life during the war, he recounts episodes with class bullies, three of the girls who are part of the Eight-to-Five Orphans; a little extortion ring collecting their dime protection money each week when it is time to buy bonds,; an old lady who has a genuine Pan American car in her garage that Davy and Scooter discover during a scrap collection excursion and who holds an even greater surprise for them than the buckshot she fires when she discovers them in her garage; and the old lady who hordes everything, including every newspaper she has ever received. All these eccentric characters are given their own background story, including families created by Peck with a kind of depth and charming believability, so they become more than just plot devices.On the Wings of Heroes is an historical fiction novel that will give you a sense of the war from the perspective of a preteen boy and will leave you with a warm feeling of family and community, of love and support. Ironically, some of Peck's descriptions of neighborhood life, such as Halloween or playing Hide and Seek, are not so very different from my own memories of those things many years later, providing a comforting kind to timelessness that connects people through time and space.On the Wings of Heroes is a serious, entertaining and thought-provoking novel. Peck writes, even about war, with lots of humor, and I dare say, experience, since he would have grown up during WWII, just as Davy does and giving the novel a real sense of authenticity.This book is recommended for readers age 10+This book was purchased for my personal libraryThis review was originally posted on The Children's War"}], "description": "Davy Bowmans brother and their dad hung the moon.
