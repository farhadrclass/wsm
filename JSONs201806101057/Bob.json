Very engaging, with connections with mythological beings (and fairy tales) and the natural world. There's a particularly nice scene where the relatively grown-up 10-year-olds discard their reservations and play with dolls as they used to.

I mean these two are middle grade fiction super stars!!! Together in one book. Color me excited and ecstatic! I was counting the days until release day.BUT it didn\u2019t quite live up to all my hopes and dreams. Bob is cute and original for sure, but overall it lacked the emotional kick I was hoping for. Come meet Bob though. He\u2019s unforgettable! :D He\u2019s\u2026well that\u2019s the mystery isn\u2019t it? What and who is Bob? After five years, Livy is back for a visit to her grandmother\u2019s house in Australia. The last time Livy stayed with her grandmother she was 5 years old. She\u2019s changed a lot and forgotten a lot since then. Livy can\u2019t seem to remember much about her last visit actually. But she soon learns that she left someone behind. Someone who has been waiting in the closet for 5 long years. Bob!Bob, a cute green creature also known as our \u201csmall green mystery wearing a chicken suit\u201d, has been waiting for Livy to return so she can help him find his way home and hopefully discover who or what he is along the way. She promised to help! They have a mystery to solve! But Livy isn\u2019t the same Livy anymore. Can Bob help this new Livy remember the old Livy and the promise she made to him?I loved Bob! He\u2019s a little green cutie with vocabulary skills and the best chicken walk in town\u2014even though he\u2019s not a chicken\u2026or is he? You can\u2019t help but love him! There are a lot of questions surrounding Bob though. Like why is he wearing a chicken suit? Or how did he end up in Livy\u2019s closet? You have to read to find out. Bob will surprise and delight at every new twist and turn.The bump in the road for me was the unfinished feel to the story. We are told that Livy is nervous about staying away from home without her Mom, but I never felt like that issue and fear was resolved. The end along with an out-of-the-blue message about moving toward someone or something that makes you feel the most alive all felt rushed and almost forced to me. I could have used some more time at the end to wrap things up and say goodbye. Friendship shined the brightest here for sure though. Helping a friend find his way home is a big responsibility. A responsibility that takes Bob out of the closet and out in the world on an adventure to end all adventures. Does Bob find his home? I\u2019m not telling! :DRead Bob and find out. You\u2019ll find yourself rooting for this \u201cnot-zombie fake chicken\u201d all the way through!Check it out from your local Library."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5242679-brooke", "userReview": "\u201cBob\u201d by Wendy Mass is a strange little tale about a girl who visits her grandmother in Australia and finds a green creature dressed in a chicken suit in her closet named Bob...I know it sounds so strange! I often feel nostalgic as an adult reading middle grade books and the themes that are so universal in them no matter your age. I certainly can name many other books that are better than \u201cBob\u201d, but I have to say this one had it in sections and I could totally see it becoming a very cute and successful animated film. It would be adorable! I appreciated Mass\u2019 unique take on the theme of friendship (that is so popular in middle grade) and her setting being in Australia. Overall, I would think that many kids would enjoy this story and adults too will find Bob to be a very funny and a genuine friend.

As an adult reader, I thought a lot about the imaginary friends of my childhood while reading this book, which tackles the liquidity of memory -- how easily certain experiences can slip through our fingers and into the cracks of the earth -- but also provides children with a fun fantasy story, one that doesn't rely on tired tropes like faeries, elves, unicorns, etc., but instead the character of \"Bob,\" who feels wholly original and fresh. I read this book because Rebecca Stead is one of my favorite authors. Going into this book, I didn't know what her contribution was. It appears that Stead wrote the Livy chapters and Mass wrote the Bob chapters, with some overlap. I feel like Stead's influence shines strongly in this collaboration, and I thoroughly enjoyed every chapter.

When Livy goes with her mom and new little sister to spend some time visiting grandma in Australia, she finds she has almost no memories of being there five years before. Until she finds Bob waiting patiently in her closet. Bob is a... well, they're not too sure what Bob is. He's small and has green skin and doesn't have to eat (though he likes to!) or sleep very much. And five-year-old Livy told Bob to stay in the closet and that she's be back for him. And now - five years later - she finally is. And she's determined to figure out what Bob is and where he came from and finally help him get home. Told from the perspectives of both Bob and Livy, this book reminded me a little bit of Toys Go Out with Bob's unusual non-human perspective. The stuff he knows about the world are things that a five-year-old taught him. She called him a zombie, so that's what he thinks he is. And the reader unravels the mystery of Bob right along with Bob and Livy as the story progresses. Hand this one to readers who enjoy unusual perspectives (like Toys Go Out by Emily Jenkins) or stories about oddball characters (like Odd, Weird, and Little by Patrick Jenkins)."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1753322-amanda", "userReview": "I loved this, and the twists and turns along the way kept me guessing.
