Unfortunately, after the amusingly gonzo kickoff, the subsequent two-thirds of the book is the most epic filler of all time \u2013 a plotless pile of twisty-worded tangents about everything on Earth the author can think of, packed with in-jokes and puns and double-entendres and tonal shifts from slapstick to droll to burlesque to self-deprecating to farcical and my god it\u2019s way more exhausting than funny and I\u2019m not kidding it goes on FOREVER before anything resembling a story returns and it almost gets good again until it contrives a flimsy solution to the main problem, then cuts off mid-climax and goes straight to the denouement. I normally like Valente\u2019s writing; how she managed to write a novel without a single interesting character and stretch about 5000 words of story into 80,000 words is, admittedly, an impressive feat, and also completely mystifying and frustrating and disappointing."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish", "userReview": "Life is beautiful. And life is stupid.\nOnce upon a time on a small, watery, exciteable planet called Earth ... we find out that we are indeed not alone in the universe. On the contrary. The universe is teeming with all kinds of life (including the most improbably forms of FTL transportation) and after a horrible intergalactic war, every sentient species has agreed on a form of contest with which to entertain but also combat one another. And it is a way of discerning if a species is sentient or shall be annihilated. The contest? Well ... basically it is like the Eurovision Song Contest. The performance on stage is at least as important as how well you can sing. The different standards for beauty and talent the different galactic races have aren't helping any more than the bloodthirstiness of most of them.After humanity has been brought up to speed about not being alone and having to participate in this year's contest if we want to survive, we are given a list of potential contestants ... the problem being that all but one are either dead or incapacitated. *lol*Thus, Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroe(s) travel through space (with a freshly talking cat and at least two well-meaning aliens) and try to prevent humanity from being wiped out by at least not coming in last in Galactovision. Because while we might be indredibly stupid, we've also done some pretty cool things one should not forget about.Magic is real. As is evident every time Valente uses it to bind words onto the page, arranging those words so perfectly, I want to weep. Seriously, while this book is as silly as any of Douglas Adams' work (I really think he and Sir Pratchett would be proud to welcome this author in their midst), the author never fails to convey profound truths about life, being human and everything else wrapped up in glitter and laughs.There is trivia, there are some side-stabs at certain performers *coughs*TaylorSwift*coughs* and enough snark to fill three books. The concept had already been wonderful but the execution is simply brilliant. Also noteworthy is the narrator of the audio version and how he brings to life so much of the humour by the different voices he gives the aliens (and the man can sing!). The book will always be perfect but I truly believe that the audio version gives it an additional level of greatness."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Update: I dunno, people.

And worse. The sheer amount of delightful rock-and-roll trivia and snark made me think of Rob Reid's Year Zero, but this was better. Think about all the aging Glam Rock stars who have had their best days long ago being catapulted into galactic society in a sing-off with the stakes being the fate of the race. You know, time lag.

A new species that comes last is deemed to be not-sentient, a danger to interstellar civilization and is exterminated. It's Earth's turn, and representing us we have washed-up glampunk band Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes.The author explicitly calls out the link to Douglas Adams in the afterword as being the godfather of all SF humor writing, and she doesn't attempt to dodge that here, instead leaning in to the classic Hitchhikers-like bizarre digressions into humorous exposition. The comparison to Hitchhikers is very apt. Still, this book is definitely Valente's own, as Decibel Jones's regret for what happened to the band and his willingness to aggressively embrace the alien and bizarre help strengthen humanity's case. Oort's journey is no less interesting as the ostensible sellout punk musician reaching for the youth that he's left behind. And there's plenty of humor and comment on the the current state of humanity by the various and well-characterized alien species.Superb, but maybe not for everyone, much like the Hitchhikers Guide novels."}, {"userName": "Jenne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26259-jenne", "userReview": "So, one time I bought a bottle of Miracle-Gro for my houseplants.

Years later, when I was moving house, I cleared out the cupboard and found the bottle, which had leaked somehow and the Miracle-Gro had actually *made the bottle itself grow*! There were all these baroque sort of globules growing fractally off the side of it. It was magical and also a bit disturbing. This book reminded me of my miraculous Miracle-Gro bottle, except that it was more like if you took a Douglas Adams novel and spilled some David Bowie on it (use your imagination) and left it in a dark cupboard for an astronomical time unit or several, this is what you would get.

Valente's sentences for their cleverness, biting humour and commentary, I find that my reaction to her work really depends on whether I'm listening to it or reading it. I tend to struggle with her long and convoluted senteneces when I read her text, but just adore her work when I listen to it as I really like her wordplay. I was concerned reading reviews for this book as people kept making glowing comments and references to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. (Even the author did for this book.) Humour can be pretty subjective, and I am one of the few people who found \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" and its subsequent books only very occasionally funny. Back to this book. I was tickled by the idea of Earth having to prove its worth and sentience at an intergalactic song competition, with a poor performance guaranteeing Earth's eradication. So I did enjoy the beginning of \"Space Opera\", but soon found myself struggling my way through the text. I was infrequently amused, and kept wishing this book were only a novella. I thought the aliens and their diversity were inventive and great, but didn't need entire chapters devoted to all the alien politics and previous competitors' performances.

What a book!This was such a wonderful, wild ride. Valente's writing is gorgeous, per usual.The middle portion of this dragged a bit for me, but I also think this is the kind of book where I'll pick it up to reread those passages that I initially thought of as boring. EVERYTHING in this book feel inventive and fun and silly and gravely serious all at the same time.We flip between two stories, so to speak. One is the story of Decibal Jones and the Absolute Zeros, who have been selected to participate in an intergalactic singing competition in a bid to prove that humans are a sentient species. Failure (last place in the competition) means the entire human race will be wiped out by other aliens. The other \"story\" is not really a narrative, but rather chapters describing the various alien races we encounter during the traditional narrative parts of this book. The story feels a bit stop-start, but Valente really flexes her creative chops so at the end of the day I just have to tip my hat to those alien chapters. At its core this is a book about empathy, about respecting the other. Like life, that weighty theme is often wrapped up in a whole lot of silliness, but Valente manages to bring back the seriousness at the core of this book with skill.This is a bizarre, amazing book that I will definitely pick up again."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "3.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2018/05/12/...The first line of the description for Space Opera likens it to The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and I think it\u2019s an apt comparison because the influence of Douglas Adams clearly shows (and the author even acknowledges it). This is the kind of book that will make you simultaneously laugh and shake your head in amazement wondering how anyone could have come up with such crazy ideas. Considering how my first experience with a Valente novel was something of a downer (with The Refrigerator Monologues) this over-the-top and fun-filled romp through the galaxy was the breath of fresh air I needed.Our story starts in the new future, when Earth suddenly finds itself visited by a bright blue, seven-foot-tall flamingo-like alien who offers humanity an opportunity to join the greater galactic civilization at large. However, after the disastrous results of a galaxy-wide conflict known as the Sentience Wars, these invitations are hardly going to be simply handed out to every new species they come across. So, what ultimately determines whether humans will be deserving of recognition and a place among the stars? The Metagalactic Grand Prix, a singing contest in which all prospective species vying for inclusion must compete to prove their worth. Come in dead last, and you will be deemed non-sentient and unfit to join the intergalactic community. Worse, your entire species will then be exterminated to prevent you from becoming a danger to yourself and others. (\u201cHey,\u201d the blue alien bird thingy pretty much says to the people of Earth, \u201cI didn\u2019t make the rules. I\u2019m just telling you all what\u2019s up, so you better choose your representatives wisely if you don\u2019t want your whole planet incinerated.\u201d)The good news is that the aliens are not just going to let the humans flounder, and they\u2019ve even provided a helpful list of their favorite singers and bands\u2014those they believe might have the best chance at success in the contest. The bad news is, pretty much everyone on that list is dead and gone, except for Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes, a washed-up glam punk rock band who had one single hit in the mid-2000s before fading rapidly back into mediocrity. The band\u2019s frontman, who was just getting used to being completely forgotten, is suddenly thrust back into the limelight as all of humanity\u2019s hope now rests on his and his bandmates\u2019 performance at the Grand Prix. Things aren\u2019t looking too good for Earth, but at the very least, people are reminding themselves that they don\u2019t have to win. Just as long as they don\u2019t come in last, humanity has a chance! Unfortunately, Decibel \u201cDess\u201d Jones isn\u2019t even sure he has what it takes in him anymore, not to mention one of his band members, Oort St. Ultraviolet, is has become a weary middle-aged commercial musician with an ex-wife and two kids, and the other, Mira Wonderful Star, is dead, killed in a car crash. Everyone on Earth is now counting on what\u2019s left of the Absolute Zeroes to get past all their insecurities and hang-ups in order to pull off a literal out-of-this-world performance\u2014one that will mean either life or death for the entire human race.Wow, where do I start? First: freaking awesome premise! But as this is Catherynne Valente, insanely and wonderfully creative ideas are pretty much a given. Her style can take some getting used to, especially in this case, where the novel is presented as an almost rambling narrative full of tangents and asides (some of which are just as interesting, if not more so, than the main story being told). In fact, the characters themselves even feel like mere footnotes at times\u2014ancillary pieces of information tacked on to add more context to what\u2019s playing out on the page. As a \u201ccharacters first\u201d kind of reader, I thought at first this would bother me, but that didn\u2019t turn out to be the case. After all, how could I not be immediately drawn in by the wonders and fascinating sights of this amazing universe that the author has created? A small story in a big galaxy is how I look at this one. While it\u2019s true that the book is more exposition heavy, and character development might be on the lighter side, Valente has really gone all out with her imagination and world-building here. Just reading about all the different kinds of unique alien species and cultures she has invented is worth the price of admission alone.And then there\u2019s the humor. It can be described as a mixed bag, but satire is definitely a major component. Valente spares nothing and nobody, poking fun at everything from sci-fi genre tropes to the absurdities of human existence. There are also pop culture references aplenty, as well as moments of slapstick comedy and just plain silliness. Admittedly, it can also become a bit too much at times, and I\u2019ve noticed that the author has a tendency to get carried away, especially when she\u2019s getting into a rhythm and doesn\u2019t know when to hold back. Despite the story\u2019s energetic pacing, things started flag for me in the last third of the book, quite possibly as a result of the novelty starting to wear off and fatigue settling in. Also, humor being so subjective, the strange and madcap nature of the kind in this book will mean that it won\u2019t be for everyone. Your mileage may vary, and personally, I was able to enjoy the style and tone of the novel, but even I felt it ended exactly when it should have.All in all, Space Opera was good fun\u2014as you would expect from a novel with its loud and glittery cover, quippy tagline, and punny title. Its premise is most certainly guaranteed to be nothing you\u2019ve ever seen before, full of lightness and frivolity, but there\u2019s also a lot of heart and meaning. That said, I was still glad when the book finished when it did, before we started going overboard with the comedic shenanigans and lengthy asides. Valente might have wound up overdoing it in the end anyhow, but then managed to pull it back just in time for a satisfying conclusion."}, {"userName": "G33z3r", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r", "userReview": "Sad to say this attempt to become Douglas Adams went awry. It's just not funny enough to make up for its lack of character and story. The \"plot\" is just too small to hang the book on, so it's been filled with digressions as exposition, trying desperately to be funny though absurdist non-sequiters. (Certainly the Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, to which the promotional material boldly refers, had its share of such digressions & the absurd, but Adams attached those to a storyline (farcical, but fast-moving) and a likable character as bemused as the reader to lead us through it. Of most of the book, Space Opera abandons its character, a one-time band headliner named Decibel Jones, and his very simple story (chosen to sing in a galactic competition with Earth's existence at stake), preferring to spend its time briefing the reader on the history and manners of a dozen odd-ball extraterrestrial civilizations. It's often more like a wacky, acid-fueled collection of encyclopedia entries than a novel.It's not that I didn't find anything funny (\"one of the hallmarks of sentience is the ability to look down upon others.\"), just not enough to justify reading some very tedious sections whose wackiness strays into gibberish."}, {"userName": "Lena", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena", "userReview": "This book is what comes from combining refined sugar, cocaine, and a word processor.

It's so over-the-top it's almost exhausting, it's comedy, it's so alien - but it's also a very human, very serious book. Its main themes are what it means to be human, whether human life is redeemable, the importance of art, and the nature of life itself.But Space Opera didn't stop here, and that's why I loved it.

I liked the writing style - that quirky, tongue-in-cheek humour. I absolutely see why it has drawn so many comparisons to Hitchhiker's. It felt that way to me too. And Eurovision in space? That's a killer concept right there, and one that seems tailor made to my interests.And yet...and yet, it didn't quite hit the mark. I was absolutely enamoured for the first few hours. And then...and then, there were spots that totally broke my immersion, too many times for me to trust the book and get back into the flow. Some were little things, like talking repeatedly about \"Piccadilly Square\" - by which I think she's referring to Piccadilly Circus, which is the absolutely opposite of a square (well...is a circle the opposite of a square? I'm not sure. Maybe. Go with it.). Or often referencing Mr. Rogers - I only know who he is from the internet, and even then, all I know is he's a children's TV presenter that people liked, nothing more. I don't believe a Brit in the future (though it's never specified how far in the future we are) would know him so well as to reference him as one of the \"good things about humanity\".Some were a little larger; the Whitehall employees being openly racist towards Decibel in front of him as they drive him for an audience with the Queen. And why are they racist? Because if the singer chosen for the intergalactic Eurovision contest is from the UK, surely it should have been a white person. Which look, I'm not saying Britain doesn't have it's fair share of racism (it does) or that people who work for the Queen are definitely not racist (I'm sure some are), but the fact that they would just talk about it openly with him is just plain ridiculous. If they were racist, I imagine they would wait until he was gone, you know? It came across as incredibly hamfisted.Ugh. Anyway. These weren't deal breakers, more mild quibbles that got on my nerves because I'm easily annoyed at people writing Britain badly, but it did make it so much harder to suspend my disbelief.And then...and then came the overlong tangents that went into the entire histories of all these different species, very few of which were relevant to the story at hand. The worldbuilding was interesting, but it was the definition of infodumping, with not enough humour to get away with it.The whole of the semifinals went on too long, and then the final went on for not long enough. The entirety of the ending was crammed into the last hour of the book, with no room to breathe at all. In fact, I had to relisten to it three times, to make sure I hadn't missed anything, because suddenly everything was wrapping up and I got whiplash from how quick it moved and how many new moving parts came into play in just three chapters.I did really like Decibel and Oort as characters, though. They were realistic and felt human. The relationship between them was well-written, full of conflict of having known someone for too many years and gone through too many traumas together. But the kind of relationship where you can't help but love that person because of all that shit. The cat, too, was a great addition, and accurate to how I imagine cats who could talk would act.It was fun. I liked it well enough. It just wasn't my favourite or anything to write home about, and I just had too swollen of expectations to be anything but disappointed now. If it was perhaps 50% shorter, a lot of my main issues with it would be solved.But I would put money on it being a Hugo nominee next year."}, {"userName": "Rachel (rachandbooks)", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1436861-rachel-rachandbooks", "userReview": "\u201cLife is beautiful and life is stupid.\u201d I\u2019m crying- this book was so good!!!"}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25037254-robyn", "userReview": "Not an objective rating - this was just so very much fun and somehow tailored to my exact personal tastes.

Hit them with a shovel till they stop, that's how. That should be the thirtieth Unkillable Fact, I tell you what.'TEARY FEELSPLOSION AND ALL THE GRINNING.Space Opera is definitely the most bizarre and batshit crazy book I've ever read and I loved every minute of it. Humor combined with social commentary (the objective of which is to way more than just roast but I love that it does roast) combined with all the flaws and a little bit beauty of humanity combined with just a hell of a lot of inventive creativity and run-on sentences over run-on sentences.The humor is just so well done and there's a lot of it from wry to self-deprecating to sarcastic to snarky to just some of the alien entities trying to make humans feel at ease by doing things like manifesting as fucking Clippy (NEVER getting over this haha).\n'After fifteen minutes, I actually asked it to kill me, but I was informed that would be nonunion work.''I don't really neat, if you know what I mean. I'm better at mutilate. Or impale.\nThe world-building is done equally well. There's a lot of analogies and imagery involved when describing planets and the aliens that live on (and in some cases, in) those planets and as expected, it's all very extra but it also just fits perfectly with everything else going on in the book.My favorite part is that Decibel Jones is Pakistani-Nigerian-Welsh-Swedish, how much he loves his Nani (grandmother) and how larger than life and immensely fucked up he is. Oort has his own issues with how everything in life turned out for him, but he remains hardworking, resigned and may just have to do something about his anxiety, again, hundreds of light years away from home. As for Mira, I instantly loved her sobs. The story of Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes is teary and heartwarming; it's about their estranged relationship and how they hate each a little bit but also love each other. Really, Space Opera is basically about life and how kindness and accepting the other are the things that count in the end. It's about the bad, the good, the stupid, the ethical, the barbaric and everything in between. It is a concept executed light years away from earth and executed well.Favorite quotes: 'After all, you always win against the monsters, even though you're the ones slowly cooking your planet because you can't be bothered not to, butchering one another for fun and profit, making up elaborate stories that start with being calm and treating everyone with kindness and equality but somehow always end with somebody getting enslaved, absolutely obliterating the other species with whom you share a world so you can take a photograph with their corpses or gobble up their best features in hopes of achieving a more satisfying erection, and being generally willing to sell the fleeting, unique, fragile lives of everyone you've ever met if it means you can consume a slightly larger share of resources than they can. ''People are mostly happiest when they think they're just about to get the thing they want most.Before and after, they're all monsters.'"}, {"userName": "Ran", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2397418-ran", "userReview": "Sentient beings of the universe(s) had an all-out war over sentience.

space-faring life. In the aftermath, a curious tradition was invented-something to cheer up everyone who was left and bring the shattered worlds together in the spirit of peace, unity, and understanding.Once every cycle, the civilizations gather for the Metagalactic Grand Prix - part gladiatorial contest, part beauty pageant, part concert extravaganza, and part continuation of the wars of the past. Instead of competing in orbital combat, the powerful species that survived face off in a competition of song, dance, or whatever can be physically performed in an intergalactic talent show. The stakes are high for this new game, and everyone is forced to compete.This year, though, humankind has discovered the enormous universe. And while they expected to discover a grand drama of diplomacy, gunships, wormholes, and stoic councils of aliens, they have instead found glitter, lipstick and electric guitars. Mankind will not get to fight for its destiny - they must sing.A one-hit-wonder band of human musicians, dancers and roadies from London - Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes - have been chosen to represent Earth on the greatest stage in the galaxy. And the fate of their species lies in their ability to rock.", "title": "Space Opera", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24100285-space-opera", "average": 3.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1518017807l/24100285.jpg", "reviews": 540, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/338705.Catherynne_M_Valente", "name": "Catherynne M.
