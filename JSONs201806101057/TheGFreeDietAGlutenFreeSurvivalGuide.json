And this book proves it.So here's what I thought. Overall, it averages out to 3 stars. Let's remember that this woman isn't a doctor, a nutritionist, or frankly anyone with even five seconds of experience working in healthcare, so she isn't entirely accurate in her use of terms like \"allergy.\" But she is doing an OK job making celiac disease accessible to folks who maybe received a diagnosis but an inadequate education from their provider.Her horrific personality has gifted her with many sneaky ways to avoid gluten, like swapping plates at a meal, and forcing other people to eat your glutened food. Seriously, I was impressed to find that she's really good at this. I thought the only things she could do were reproduce and spew homophobia, but it turns out she's good at one other thing.Now the part that is irritating is that she tries (and frankly fails) at spinning a GF diet into the new diet craze. Sure, some people (myself included) lose weight when they go GF, but most celiacs are so malnourished from years of malabsorption that they GAIN weight upon going GF. Sure, I'm a huge advocate of GF, it's made my life better, and I probably wouldn't go back to eating gluten even if I could. But good luck selling that to most people who have functional digestive systems.Good for newbie celiacs and partners/families of celiacs, but if you've been living GF for a while, none of this is news."}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/244276-betsy", "userReview": "I am only reading this book for the research since I'm all about the gluten free. So far I'm on chapter 4 and I have mixed feelings. I enjoy the information from Dr. Peter Green, but I want to smack Elisabeth Hasselbeck. She's such an idiot. Prime example: She is crippled over in pain everyday to the point where she has to pull over to the side of the road while driving. She's seeing a holistic doctor and they are about to eliminate wheat from her diet and instead she auditions for Survivor. Um...I'm sorry, but if I were in such bad pain everyday (which I was) I would not be auditioning for a reality tv show where cameras are in your face 24/7. She is so vain. Update...I did not finish this book. It was too hard to read through how much she \"cheated\" and didn't follow a 100% gluten free diet because she didn't want to believe she couldn't eat gluten. Having celiac disease for over 10 years, there has never been a time when I thought \"it's ok if I eat gluten\" Never. I was too sick to even want to go near it. Clearly this book does not come from someone who is knowledgeable in gluten free living, because they would never advise that it's \"ok\" to \"cheat\". She also includes a chapter on how to lose weight by eating gluten free. Right there she shows she is not serious about celiac and the importance of following a gluten free diet. To lose a few lbs is sick. It's people like her that make others (media included) think that a gluten free diet is a fad. Not recommended."}, {"userName": "Laurie Carlson", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4898049-laurie-carlson", "userReview": "This book is exactly as the title states, a gluten-free survival guide. An allergy to gluten can be life altering in many ways. An allergy to gluten can also be life threatening without a person even knowing it. Gluten is a hidden source of many terrible health conditions, from arthritis, to GI troubles, to even ADHD. There are studies that even Autism may have Gluten to blame for it. This book is a must-have if you are following a gluten-free diet.This book makes heads and tales of following and understanding exactly what a gluten free diet is as it can be quite challenging to follow a gluten free diet. Elisabeth Hasselbeck was on the TV show 'Survivor', and she found out that she felt so much better while there, She tried to figure out before what was making her so sick and never could figure it out. While on the TV show, she had to resort to eating nuts, berries, and foods that grew willdly, without gluten in them. The result turned out to be that she felt SO good while on the TV show. After further investigation as to why she felt so good on the show, she finally linked it to eating foods that did not have gluten in them, without her even knowing. Once back home, eating like she used to, she got sick again. Back at the doctors office, they finally figured out what was wrong with her. She had Celiac Disease. This is a disease which is directly linked to an allergy to Gluten. Thus started her lifelong survival Gluten-Free diet. Many people are allergic to the 'gluten' that is found in many foods, lotions, creams, face creams, hand lotions, lipsticks, and more. There is gluten in products you would never think there would be gluten in. Gluten, in general, is used as a binder in products. In foods, lotions, creams, makeups, and more. Elizabeth Hasselbeck helps us make heads and tails of it all.This book contains everything you need to know about Gluten. The effects gluten can have on your health, to reproductive issues, cancer, and a myriad of other problems. She tells us how to go G-Free, and also lists other reasons who to give up Gluten in our diets. This book is chock-full of information that is unbelievably vital to having a Gluten Free diet.Anyone with intestinal problems should most likely check this book out. It may very well have something to do with Gluten.I give this book a 5-Star rating! There is no other book that contains this amount of information regarding Gluten."}, {"userName": "Fyreball", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14101321-fyreball", "userReview": "Beginning with a basic point, this book has too much questionable advice for it to be used as a survival guide. For example, as any celiac or gluten sensitive person will tell you, we usually GAIN weight once we go gluten free. This is because gluten damages our digestive system, making it hard for us to absorb nutrients. Once we remove gluten, our intestines return to health, we are able to absorb nutrients and we put weight back on. Many undiagnosed celiacs are underweight for this reason. If you think eating GF will make you skinny, you're sadly mistaken. Ms. Hasselback also discusses other POSSIBLE links between GF living and health issues. There is some evidence to support this but it is not conclusive. In quoting both my GI specialist and my rheumatologist, it's worth going GF for several months to see how it makes you feel. Personally, I've seen improvements in my digestive system, my migraines and my joint pain. But I'm a sample of one, as is Ms. Hasselback. If you're diagnosed as GF, I'd ignore the data and simply pay attention to how going GF makes you feel. This should work for all but the smallest of children and for this, you don't need a book. I found this book to be a very strange mix of good and bad advice (e.g, the author's claim that you can lose weight). Every celiac I know does a huge amount of online research on food - you can learn best from other celiacs (particularly those who aren't trying to sell a book). Personally, I don't think this book is worth the money or time. You're better off finding a great gastroenterologist and nutritionist and then finding some online GF friends who can share tips like which Thai restaurants are truly GF and where to get truly GF cooking ingredients. There is an abundance of GF foods in most grocery stores. Restaurants are a bit tougher, but you can get all of the advice you need from the GF community online."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/453999-angela", "userReview": "This was a really helpful book! Hasselbeck has become a real spokesperson and source of information for the many gluten-intolerant people who an undiagnosed, not adequately educated about their condition, and unaware of the many options for living a gluten-free life. Written in a very accessible style and language, the author covers the roots and effects of the spectrum of gluten intolerance from the medically recognized celiac disease to the idiopathic undiagnosed cases of gluten intolerance that many experience but can't find treatment or reasons for. Her information is solid and helpful and she offers a wealth of specific resources (many websites) and brand names (very important) along with sharing her own story and ongoing challenges.

Medical authorities also agree that you should not begin a gluten-free diet prior to testing as it eliminates the ability to test for celiac; there is also no benefit and possible detriment to assuming a gluten-free diet if you do not have celiac or are gluten-sensitive, yet the resounding message of this book harkening from just about every page is that everybody should be on a gluten-free diet. To her credit, some of the information about setting up a gluten-free kitchen and handling public restaurants and social situations can be helpful, but better information is available on the internet. I'm sure I would have given a higher rating to this book when it was first published as the information in this country was scarce at that time."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/658334-deb", "userReview": "I did not know anything about Elisabeth Hasselbeck before reading this book. I do not watch The View or Survivor :) Anyway, she helped me with my digestive problems more than my doctor, my gastroenterologist, and a nutritionist. None of those professionals ever suggested that any of my problems could be due to eating gluten. In fact they probably made matters worse by telling me to up my fiber intake, which I did by eating LOTS of whole grains.

In saying that, overall there was some good parts in this book that were a good introductory read to gluten free living. I learned that even when items are made on machinery or space where non-gluten items are made it can affect a person with gluten allergies. As a vegan I will buy items that say \u2018may contain milk\u2019 because that\u2019s what is written when it is made on shared machinery. I\u2019m not vegan because of an allergy so I hadn\u2019t considered that it would affect someone that is dairy-free because of their allergies. That makes me think about the seriousness of the contamination of gluten items for many people. Like nuts, it needs to be taken seriously. Sure, some people are \u2018self-diagnosed\u2019 but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry in this case, in my opinion.Aside from that, there are a few times the author makes me question her credibility. She writes from a more privileged approach where dropping a gluten cookie on the floor is a better option than simply saying no to when the cookie is offered.

I'm on a mission so along with medications, many doctors, meditation, you name it, I went off gluten. I wanted to read this book for pointers, knowing I wasn't going to be hardcore (vitamins, separate cooking utensils, etc...) but just get an idea of G-free living.Elizabeth had/has it rough! She is a true Gluten intolerant, the stuff makes her really physically sick. It was amazing to learn ( i knew a little) how disease is driven by the pharmaceutical companies. Since there is no pill for gluten intolerance, doctors don't test for it. One controls it through nutrition which means it isn't a money maker for the pharmaceutical industry. There is a test but you have to push your Dr. to test for it which doesn't seem right to me.Thankfully so much has changed in the field of nutrition. Gluten-free foods are more readily available at commercial grocery stores, specialty grocery stores pop up everywhere & there are many websites that offer great gluten-free options.Gluten can affect not only your digestive system but headaches, anemia, constipation, discolored teeth, fatigue, joint or bone pain, loss of dental enamel, muscle cramps, etc...

When Hasselbeck discovered she had Celiac's Disease, it was after much struggle and lack of support from her doctors and the medical community. She soon realized that she had to fight for her own health and be her own health advocate. Now she is probably the most well-known spokesperson for getting the word out and supporting people with Celiac's Disease. People might criticize her for writing this book and proclaim, \"She's not a doctor. How can she write about a medical condition with any sort of authority?\" Well, first of all, the fact that she's not a doctor makes this book that much more accessible and readable to the general public, but second of all, let's not forget that the medical community all but turned their back on Hasselbeck as she attempted to figure out what was wrong with her body.

She asked doctors and consulted nutritionists, but no one seemed to have any answers. It wasn't until spending time in the Australian Outback, living off the land on the grueling Survivor TV show, that, ironically, her symptoms vanished. Returning home, she pinpointed the food that made her sick -- gluten, the binding element in wheat. By simply eliminating it from her diet, she was able to enjoy a completely normal, healthy life.
