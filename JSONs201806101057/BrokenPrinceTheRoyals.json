These Royals will ruin you and I have been Royally Ruined, my friends. I\u2019ve been trying to write this review for about 2-3 weeks now and every time I start it I can\u2019t get past being ruined. After I finished Paper Princess earlier this year, I had the biggest book hangover ever. That cliffhanger about killed me and I was dying to see what happened. When Broken Prince showed up on my kindle, I couldn\u2019t wait to read it. I had to know what happened. I thought I was ruined after the first books cliffhanger, but let me tell you\u2026 this books cliffhanger. OMG. I can\u2019t even think about this craziness. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll survive the 3 months till we get the next book in this series! \n\nReed, the destroyer. It would be a cool nickname if it wasn\u2019t my life and hers that I\u2019m taking down. \nAfter book one, it was pretty obvious that Reed screwed up everything. Things between Reed and Ella are pretty messed up. At the end of Paper Princess we are left with Reed making an colossal error in judgment and Ella skipping town. Things in the Royal house aren\u2019t good. With Ella gone, tension is at an all time high between the Royal brood. I\u2019m really hesitant to talk much about this story. I want readers to go in and be shocked by all the revelations and storylines just like I did, so I\u2019ll leave out anymore about the plot of the book. Just know it takes a few wild and crazy turns and many things I didn\u2019t expect to see happening did. \nIt was so great to see the Royal family again. I love all these brothers. Even the ones I wasn\u2019t so sure of have grown on me. My favorite by far is still Easton. There is something about him I just adore. I love his relationship with Ella and how he cares for her so much, in a brotherly sort of way. Then there is Reed. Reed Royal. Oh, Reed. The first book, I didn\u2019t know what to think about Reed. I loved Reed. Some of the time, I hated Reed. Going into Broken Prince I wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d feel about him. After finishing, there is only one way to feel. You will love Reed Royal. I can\u2019t see anyone not loving him. Ella is one tough cookie. I loved how she handled all the situations she was put in. Her life is so different now than it used to be, and she really is a great heroine. She handles everything with grace and keeps things together. \nWhat else can I say about these books? They are by far the most addictive books I have read in a long time. When you pick them up, you will get sucked into this Royal world and not know what hit you. I love the writing, the characters, the story line, the shocks, and surprises. Once you pick up this book, be prepared to stay up all hours of the night finishing it. You won\u2019t want to put it down!This book will jack you up in the best way possible. My heart was beating fast, my palms were sweating and I was on pins and needles while reading. This is by far one of the best series I\u2019ve read this year. If you\u2019re looking for an all consuming read, pick this series up!"}, {"userName": "Val \u2693\ufe0f Shameless \u2693\ufe0f Steamy Reads", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11626803-val-shameless-steamy-reads", "userReview": "All I can say is....Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha...Oh le giggle.

Eventually I'll wear him down, convince him we're a beautiful fairy tale. But we're not. We\u2019re nothing. We're smoke - insubstantial and meaningless \u2026 We aren\u2019t even a tragedy. We\u2019re less than nothing.\u201d \n\nBroken Prince is a sick fairytale. It's the story of a broken boy who met a broken girl, fell in love with her and then crashed her. The Royals are the most fucked-up, twisted family and yet instead of disgust all I felt towards them was sympathy, devotion and \nlove\n.Broken Prince was so much better than Paper Princess. It was a tad dark, and the dirty secrets of the royally messed-up family that were revealed shocked and hurt me, but they made me understand better why these boys were so lost and dealt with their pain and abandonment issues using sex, alcohol and drugs. I can't help but blame their parents for that. I am not angry at Gideon, Easton and the twins for the slighlty disturbing things they did. I just feel sorry for them.And then there is Reed.Ok, that's a big fat lie. But luckily my faith in him was restored, and I witnessed with eagerness and hope his attempts to win Ella back. In fact I enjoyed his perspective more than hers, because it shed light to his guilt, his self-loathing and the ugly things he did but later regretted. I believe that deep down he is a good guy, it's just the battle against his demons that wears him down.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s mine and always has been. From before we even met, she was mine and I was hers. I fought it too long, but I\u2019m giving in now. I\u2019m all in now.\n\nTension, steam, greed and malice are Erin Watt's ingredients of writing a gripping story you can't help but read in one sitting. Yes I did find some incidents extravagant and questioned my sanity for loving characters whose issues would make any therapist rich beyond imagination, but the thing is, I became attached to them. I want them to be happy because that will make me happy. In the end, I felt exhausted after this emotional roller-coaster and the cliffhanger from Hell, and I wondered how on God's green earth I will survive until October."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "After finishing 'Paper Princess', I dived right into 'Broken Prince'. I had to know what would become of Ella and all of the Royals after that ending. Talk about a cliffhanger! I was pulling my hair out with the way the first book ended. Luckily, I didn't start this series until all three books were out, so I didn't have to wait for long. I feel for my friends that had to live with that anxious anticipation for long.Picking up where 'Paper Princess' left off, Ella is on the run. This time around, the entire Royal household is furious with Reed. They'd grown to love Ella as much as they had originally despised her and nobody is happy to have her gone. No one feels her absence more than Reed, who knows that he is to blame for her disappearance. As angry as everyone is with him, it could never compare to the anger he feels toward himself.In comparison to the first book, 'Broken Prince' is told primarily from Reed's POV. It was nice to get his viewpoint and fitting for the situation. After everything he did in the first book, I needed validation of his feelings.While 'Paper Princess' highlighted the unity of the Royal brothers, 'Broken Prince' spotlights their decline. Easton is falling deeper into his dangerous addictions. The twins have kind of broken away from their other brothers. Reed has stopped caring about school or anything other than finding Ella.Meanwhile, the school has turned into a war zone. Without the Royal brothers to keep things in check, Jordan and the other bullies have unleashed a reign of terror on anyone they consider beneath them. In her absence, the rumors about Ella have been vicious and plentiful, ensuring that she'll have her work cut out for her upon her return.Eventually, Callum is able to locate Ella and bring her home. Although she's not happy about it, she has to admit that she had begun to think of the Royals as her family and their home as hers. While she is not looking forward to facing Reed after his betrayal, she realizes that her actions have affected others as well. Ella has to make amends for the pain that she caused when she left abruptly. Aside from Easton, Val was also hurt by her lack of communication. Not to mention that she up and left her bakery job without any notice. Just as Ella has some pologizing to do, Reed is doing his best to work his way back into Ella's good graces. As determined as he is to win her over again, she seems equally determined not to be fooled by him again. His betrayal is not something that she's willing to easily forgive or forget.Like the first book, 'Broken Prince' ends with another huge cliffhanger. This book has several twists and turns that keep this story interesting. I never knew what would happen next, but I couldn't wait to see.Finishing this book, I immediately started 'Twisted Palace'. This series has consumed me. I cannot get enough of the Royals and the dysfunction that surrounds them. They're my latest guilty pleasure!"}, {"userName": "Nastassja", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7734134-nastassja", "userReview": "Actual rating: 1.5\nBuddy read with Sarah.

We\u2019re smoke\u2014insubstantial and meaningless.We aren\u2019t even a tragedy. We\u2019re less than nothing.\u201dLet me present to you: Orphan Stripper, Douche and Creepy Dad Volume two. Ta-dam. This book will blow your mind with its genius ways and make you revaluate your whole life, because you'll understand you wasn't living till the moment you took this precious book in your hands and miracle happened... Oh crap, let's cut this shit. I was trying to be witty above, but I don't think this book deserves witty. It was boring as fuck and it was dumb as fuck. What kind of review can you write on such books? \nSo, in a nutshell that is what happened in there:\nElla the Stripper runs away. She is quickly handled back to Royal Douches. One of the Douches (either the second son or the creepy dad) impregnates the Creepy Girlfriend. Creepy Girlfriend wants a ring on her finger or she'll tell the world she was screwing both Royal Douches. *gasp*This is such a strong motive for blackmailing. Of course, you must comply or your life will be over over (that was actually sarcasm here). But look, Douche decides to follow up with the demand even though he knows for sure the baby isn't his. They don't demand Creepy Girlfriend to make a DNA test and verify the baby is actually Douche's. There's a hint for you, Douches: Creepy Girlfriend could've slept with any man in town and presented his baby as yours. That idea ever crossed your mind? Nope? Orphan Stripper finds out about the baby. She breaks up (for the thousandth time) with Douche (but she still can't forget his abs). Douche can't stop thinking about his girl (says \"my girl\" all the time). Every girl is a slut compared to her- literary a slut- because there's no girl in this school or this town who hadn't have sex or talked about sex or constantly obsess with sex. Even the Orphan Stripper's best friend after breaking up with her boyfriend can't stop thinking who she wants to bang next now that she is a free woman. Ah, ever thought that a girl could be single and feel a whole person? No again? This book is practically glowing with warning \"slut shaming everywhere!\" But Orphan Stripper is special and a virgin*Is this some kind of a horror movie where virgins survive the ending and the rest of the girls die? Ella, The Final Girl, huh? What? I can't hear what you are saying? Nope? it's not a horror movie? Are you sure? Because the settings are just right... Oh, ok, let's move on.* After a major slut-shaming part with Orphan Stripper's v-card still intact (I swear, v-card was mentioned like a million times here) we are nearing the culmination part. Ella the Stripper decides to get Douche back, because, let's be honest, who wouldn't want a boy with living breathing dick which can sit, stand and bark no worse than any cute puppy... Oh, don't forget about Douche's magic fingers, he can stick them inside Orphan Stripper all night long and never tire of that, and I am saying nothing about his tongue, which is another epic story. After sticking fingers for a while (and probably breaching Orphan Stripper's brain with them), suddenly Ella the Stripper has a brilliant idea to give her inheritance to Creepy Girlfriend so she could get out of their lives for good (I still can't understand why give her money?). Douche decided to come clean to his Creepy Dad about his fucking sessions with Creepy Girlfriend, but turns out Creepy Dad knew all along about them and that his Douche son sticks fingers down Orphan Stripper's... you know, magic place (Creepy Dad did you just become more creepier?). And oh, the baby is not his for sure, because he was sterile for a while now and can't have kinds (thank God!). The Rapist appears in the next scene and cuts Douche with a knife. No one dies (unfortunately). Some time passes, some boring shit happens. Then someone rings on the door. It's police. What happened? Someone killed Creepy Girlfriend (yay, finally someone died!). Ella the Stripper suspects Douche (I guess his magic fingers weren't as magical after all, huh). Police takes the Douche away.Silence. Someone rings on the door again (Royal Douches are popular today). Who may it be... Oh look, it's Orphan's Stripper's dead father (zombie movie, huh?). I guess I shouldn't call her Orphan any longer?Steve, they say and the screen goes blank. That was a major cliffhanger if you hadn't guessed yet. Here, I have some bonus scenes for you: The older Royal Douche brother was banging Ella the Stripper's Creepy Stepmother. She blackmailed him into sex by threatening to publicly expose his and his girlfriend's sexting (obviously she hacked his phone and found those. Genius Hacker Creepy Stepmother!). In this country (wherever the characters live) they burn people on stakes for sexting, because I don't see other reasons for dropping your girlfriend, because of that blackmailing and continuing banging the Creepy Stepmother for a year or so. Meanwhile younger Royal Douche brothers continue banging their shared girlfriend. The middle Royal Douche brother continues banging his brothers' exes. *End of the bonus part*I've probably missed some other \"important\" events from this book, but you know, all I left to say about the Royal Douches is this:\u201cYou should be strung up by your nuts and hung out to dry.\u201dDon't read this book crap"}, {"userName": "Christine Wallflower & Dark Romance Junkie ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11641363-christine-wallflower-dark-romance-junkie", "userReview": "On a scale of 1 to 10 how happy and shocked am I?I think an even 20 would aptly explain my current emotional status.

I couldn\u2019t ask for a better sequel to book one.Basically I have so many feelings about this book I need to express them in gifs. So this is gonna be a giftastic review. Here we go!When the arc hit my kindle:Me after reading this book:Let\u2019s start from the beginning, or I should say the end of book one. Ella has left the Royal household heartbroken and alone. The Royal family desperately wants to find her as she is the missing piece of the puzzle that held their dysfunctional family together. Reed has a past he needs to explain to Ella and he needs to make amends for wrongdoings.That\u2019s all I will say about the plot, really. What I can say is, I LOVED THIS BOOK! Paper Princess is already one of my favorite books of 2016 and I am so happy that Broken Prince was just as amazing, it lived up to all of my expectations and more.  \u201cMy instincts had screamed at me that she was trouble. My instincts were wrong. She wasn\u2019t trouble. I was. Still am. Reed, the destroyer.\u201d  These characters, they are what make the book so special. Flawed, raw, and maladjusted they may be, but they stick to your heart with an iron grip and do not let go. My favorite character? Easton! Is that really a surprise? This bad boy steals the show in any scene he is present in and I love how the authors continue to peel back the layers and show who he is beneath his tough exterior.  \u201cWhatever girl takes on Easton is going to have to hold a whip in one hand and a pistol in the other.\u201d  I also adore Ella as a heroine. She's such a good person through and through. She defends the weak and stands by her friends when they need her. With all the craziness going on with some of the side characters, I can honestly say I personally would have tried to blend into the shadows. Instead Ella faced those who bullied and fought them head on. She's an admirable girl, and an amazing heroine for us to read about.  \"Ella Harper doesn't forget. Ever.\"  Delicious angst is present in this book as well, intricately woven into the story without being overwhelming. And this book was FUNNY. There were several moments where I laughed out loud and then was so glad I wasn\u2019t reading in public and no one could see. There were also so many plot twists and turns, this book will keep you guessing! Never a dull moment in the life of a Royal.There are some characters in this book, I really hope they get what\u2019s coming to them in Twisted Palace.That ending???There were some plot points I had guess at timidly, but I didn\u2019t see that ending coming at all. When is Twisted Palace coming out?????? I cannot wait!!!!! Overall I think fans of the first book will love this second installment. It\u2019s a book I was unable to put down and I never wanted to leave the Royal world. And if you haven\u2019t read Paper Princess yet, what are you waiting for?????

Hats off to these amazing authors Elle Kennedy and Jen Frederick A.K.A. Erin Watt for this brilliant sequel!I cannot properly formulate a thought, but this sequel was done in a very classy fashion and I absolutely loved it!Broken Prince begins when Reed Royal searched for Ella Harper after she left the Royal mansion. It took the Royal family two weeks to get her back. When their girl was finally home thanks to Callum Royal's endless connections, things started to become more interesting, or rather, more twisted, in the Royal house. This time, Brooke (the witch in Paper Princess), is the one in control because she has the upper hand. She manipulated Reed through her stupid blackmail scheme. Meanwhile, Ella's love-hate feelings toward Reed and her growing affection to the Royal family also confused her. Secrets and revelations soon came out bit by bit which made Ella's stay in the mansion all the more dramatic.\n\n\"She wants me to know it's over, but we both know it's not.\"\n\nI just loved how intoxicating this sequel was for me. There was absolutely nothing that I disliked. The plot was very impressive and the pacing was fast it kept me gripped from start to finish. It was also enriched with character development. In Paper Princess, Reed was so hesitant to fight for Ella and show her how he felt, but in this book, he gave it all. I loved how he fight those bullies at Astor Park just to prove a point to never mess with 'his girl'. HIS GIRL.\n\n\"From before we even met, she was mine and I was hers. I fought it too long, but I'm giving in now. I'm all in now.\"\n\nAnd as usual, Ella was badass. This girl doesn't stop impressing me with her ability to dodge those stupid remarks from Jordan and the rest of the people in bully town. Favorite scene: Ella vs. Jordan match. And those TWISTS. Omg there were twists and juicy parts thrown in this book! How could these authors do such surprises like the ones they cooked here?\n\n\"My instincts had screamed at me that she was trouble. My instincts were wrong. She wasn't trouble. I was. Still am.\"\n\nThe romance, on the other hand, was very enticing. Reed and Ella continue to swoon me with their chemistry and cheesy dialogues. There was certainly a romantic development here which really pleases me. And my, don't even get me started on those kissing and make-out scenes.All in all, Broken Prince was the best sequel. So well-written. I loved the way those twists surprised me and the overall goodness of the book. Now if you haven't read this sequel yet, take this warning. Prepare for a cliffhanger that will ruin you!\n\n\"Nothing's really changed between us. We're still sparring, still circling each other like well-matched opponents, but we're there, in the ring, together.

GOOD.It's partly because the drama is 10/10 would drama again grade A+++. And it's partly because, SOMEHOW, I care about the characters. Just a little bit. \u21e2 the drama is so ridiculous and so freaking out of this realm that I almost can't deal sometimes. I'm that asshole that loves to play those games that are like, what would you do if... and makes up some !fucked up! scenario and honestly, I have to give it up to Erin Watt. She just laughed into my face and decided to write every bombshell situation into Broken Prince.I mean, hot damn a girl can only take so much angst lolol not true what am I saying.\u21e2 the characters are not easy ones to like. If anybody came up to me and asked me how I felt about them, my answer would probably be along the lines of \"I could not give three garbanzos whether these characters were ejected from this literary earth\". But a small, small part of me still wants them to come out of everything alive and well. And until I can get my feelings surgically removed, it'll probably stay that way. Everything else was meh, though. Nothing happened for most of the book, it was COMPLETELY unrealistic, almost pointless at times. But still, what the shit was with that ending?

Paper Princess \u2605\u2605\u2605Broken Prince is much worse than Paper Princess in every way, but it was still an addictive read that I couldn\u2019t put down. Again, I was having a rough couple of days and just wanted to read a really fast story that I didn\u2019t really have to think about, and this series totally fits that bill. This book starts off right where Paper Princess left off, and I mean right off, so thank the Lord for not having to wait for explanation to that terrible cliffhanger, but Reed\u2019s reaction was just so lame, I\u2019m sorry. We get to see the angst ensue for over fifty percent of this book, while also seeing Reed beg for Ella to forgive him for his gross actions, and then the real story gets started. It\u2019s too bad that the real story is improbable that I felt like I was watching The Bold and The Beautiful with my Grandma back in Flint, Michigan. Plus, this book is hella problematic and not only condones violence, but constantly reinforces that violence will solve your problems and you\u2019ll get away with doing shitty things. The topic of bullying is never really challenged, and it made this installment in this series much less enjoyably for me. Also, trigger warnings for losing a parent, underage sexual content (17), physical abuse, sexual assault, attempted rape, underage drinking, drug use, addiction, a lot of slut shaming, and a lot of toxic male masculinity. So please use caution before going into this book.And most importantly: This series is NOT YA! This story definitely deals with seventeen and eighteen year-olds that are still in high school, but I would still consider this NA, because of the very mature themes and because of all the sexual content. So, again, please use caution. Also, because I know most of you follow me for my fantasy reviews, I always feel it necessary to state that I rate erotic books differently than other books! I know many of the relationships are toxic and problematic and I completely understand that they wouldn\u2019t be the healthiest and/or most ideal of starts for people in real life, but I love steamy reads and I rate them purely off my enjoyment, yet this still got only two stars from me, because it became the equivalent to a soap opera in every way. Like, the twists were just too damn unbelievable that I had to laugh out loud numerous times. And I mean, like, I was witch cackling at the absurdity. And even though Paper Princess had a heart wrenching cliffhanger from hell, Broken Prince had the most annoying and outlandish cliffhanger of all time. Overall, I still recommend this series if you\u2019re looking for a quick and easy series that is honestly enjoyable. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed this one more for the laughs than for the sexy time. I obviously don\u2019t hate this series, or I wouldn\u2019t be happily binging the entire thing, but there is a lot of uncontested problematic content, on top of some of the plot being downright unbelievable.

Stunning, intense, angst-filled and thrilling. Erin Watt has done it again with their second instalment of \u201cThe Royals\u201d series \u201cBroken Prince.\u201d After reading \u201cPaper Princess\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to survive having to wait after that massive cliffy for the second one. It felt like years. My advice to anyone who has not delved into this series as of yet, is to perhaps wait until October when they\u2019re all released and then binge read them.\u201cBroken Prince\u201d starts off where \u201cPaper Princess\u201d finished and thankfully it is written in Reed\u2019s point of view also, so we were given an opportunity to go inside his head and know what makes him tick. Reed has a lot of making up to do with both Ella and his brothers, especially Easton. I am not going to go into too much detail about the story as I want readers to be as thrilled and shocked by all the twists and turns as I was.\n\u201cI\u2019m done playing games, Ella. No other girls exist in the world for me. If you see me talking to one, know that I\u2019m talking about you. If you see me walking next to someone, I\u2019m wishing it was you \u2026 You\u2019re the only one for me.\u201d\nI have developed a massive girl crush on Ella. She is such an inspirational heroine. She\u2019s headstrong, self-sufficient and feisty, but also loyal, compassionate and will do anything for those she cares for. I loved how she didn\u2019t automatically forgive Reed even though her feelings for him were so intense. It kept me glued to each and every page with anticipation on what would become of these two characters.\n\u201cHe told me to stay away. He told me I didn\u2019t belong. If only I\u2019d listened to him\u201d\nI have to say this series has by far, produced the most addictive books I have read to date this year. They contain everything I look for in a great story; intrigue, intensity, angst, humour and stellar writing with amazing characters. I thought the cliff-hanger in the first book was intense, the ending to \u201cBroken Prince\u201d was even worse\u2026\u2026.. if that\u2019s even possible. I would most definitely recommend this story to anyone who loves a thrilling ride on the emotional roller coaster. As I said before, you may want to wait until they are all released as the cliffys are a killer! I\u2019m counting down the days until \u201cTwisted Palace\u201d is released in October. 77 days to go\u2026\u2026. ;-)"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8429172-laura", "userReview": "[ Oh, my fucking gods. This book was wild.Did you think it was going to end up like this? My first question is: Didn\u2019t they bury the man? One would think, because of the disgustingly amount of money the Royals have, Callum made sure that Steve was dead.The guy probably has CIA working for him, for fucks sake. I screamed so hard on that part I probably woke up the entire neighborhood.I\u2019m still in shock, guys.I don\u2019t want Ella to doubt of Reed in the next book because we had a lot of that in this book and I think we\u2019re going to have a lot of drama and stuff going on to have also Ella dwell on Reed\u2019s innocence.When Ella said they have to get rid of Brooke and Dinah, I really thought she was going to use the excuse of the baby shower to get close to Dinah and get in her house to look for the stuff she had on Gideon. I really thought that. And maybe because it was the most obvious thing that\u2019s why the authors didn\u2019t follow through? I don\u2019t know but I think about that a lot because I wondered if they could\u2019ve put Dinah against Brooke. Like, Ella could\u2019ve let Dinah know she intended to give Brooke her inheritance. They\u2019re greedy as hell, I don\u2019t think Dinah would let that happen. Let them both destroy each other and when we found out about Brooke\u2019s death? My immediate response was  \u201cDinah killed her\u201d but why? Ella didn\u2019t put them against each other so maybe Steve did it. And it may look that way since he just fucking appeared out of the grave but why?My suspects are:1.\tDinah2.\tSteve3.\tGideon4.\tCallumThis book fucked me up.I have so many questions, I need to talk to someone who\u2019s read this book.I enjoyed the romance in this one more than I did in previous book but I still believe the love part is a bit too soon but hey, that\u2019s just me. What I did like a lot? The certainty that all the Royals love Ella. \u201cI know it scared you when she left. It hurt you.\u201d I turn to study his tense profile, and I tense up too as something occurs to me. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d I ask hoarsely.His head whirls toward me. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t. Not the way you do.\u201dI relax, just slightly. \u201cStill. You care about her.\u201dOf course he does. We all do, because that girl flew into our house like a whirlwind and made everything come alive again. She brought steel and fire. She made us laugh again.\nTo know that this messed up family can love and share so much\u2026 it\u2019s amazing.My respect for Callum grew a bit more with this book. I was perplexed when he revealed he knew all he knew and did all he did to protect Reed and his family and I think he wanted to get as close as he could and bond a bit more with his kids before he took off with Brooke. You gotta respect at least some of that.As always I like to play in my mind with the possibility of Easton and Valerie and I think this trilogy might end with Ella ruling the school for her senior year and changing things for good.

I fought it too long, but I\u2019m giving in now. I\u2019m all in now.\"\nThis author collaboration is successfully sweeping across the path of most of my fellow romance readers and there's not many that haven't loved what these authors have produced so far. 'Paper Princess' was a debut diamond that I was super eager to get my greedy reading hands on and as soon as I got my first 'Royal' fix I was ready for more. So it comes as no surprise that my expectations for book two were through the roof and although I wasn't completely blown away there was still plenty to enjoy about this second book in the series. Bravo, 'Team Royal' you've done it again. What's it all about?Broken Prince is book two in the increasingly popular 'The Royals' series. This is the follow on book to 'Paper Princess' and the second book in what's looking to be an explosive trilogy that's hard to forget. Follow the lives of the Royal brothers and all the drama, love and heartache that follows this family around.What did I love?Anything that is over the top, anxiety driven and emotional gets my vote and with the Royal family you can always expect for things to get a little crazy. And even though I lost a little love for the characters this time around I still found plenty enough to keep me interested in their story. The ending was explosive, the characters were true to their crazy antics and the secondary characters still managed to hold their own amongst all the wickedly, salacious story telling. All in all this was a solid young adult book party that packed more than a little punch it just wasn't winning all over for my tastes. Why not five? There is no doubt in my mind that this author duo has plenty of talent and if you don't believe me, then you can go and be convinced by the gazillions of five star reviews that this book is garnering. I'm very much a lone wolf with with my less than five star feelings, but as they say no two readers, read the same book. I had huge expectations going into this story, book one ('The Paper Princess') had it all; angst, romance and plenty of over the top 'Royal' style drama, so to say I was excited to jump into book two would be a little bit of an understatement. So where did it all go wrong you may ask? To wrap up my feelings in one single sentence: I found myself somewhat bored. Shocking I know, but I needed that something more to have this book slap me round my romance addict face and make me sit up and take notice. Alas, it wasn't meant to be and by the time the shock events showed up towards the end of the book it was all a little too late. Don't be misunderstood this was a likeable, well written foray just not that five star, wow addition that I was hoping for. Final thoughts ...If you like your books with plenty of theatricals and dramatic twists and turns then this series will definitely be pressing your buttons. This author duo are obviously creating original entertainment in a book world that can all to often feel over done and I'm excited to see what else they will create together but for now i'll leave you to dive into the crazy world of the Royals.

Growing up we didn't have a TV and as I got older and went to my friend's house my mom always told me not to waste my time watching soap operas over there. It became like the forbidden fruit. Yum-Yum!! One friend, in particular, told me that if I came over on Mondays and Fridays I could keep up on what was happening on Days of Our Lives. That's pretty much what I did. Next thing I knew I\u2019m hooked on Bo Brady & Hope Williams love story. I was deep in with Days of Our Lives. Even though those shows aren\u2019t even remotely close to reality I found myself addicted to their craziness. The same holds true today when I read a book. I have 2 kids in private high school and I've heard some crazy stories from my teens. It\u2019s no High School Musical for them. Not that they want it to be. *shudders* Everyone breaking out in song and dance during lunch time. No thanks! *runs and hides* The Royals high school is nothing like High School Musical either \u2026 it\u2019s a tad spicier than the Disney version of high school. Okay, it\u2019s a little more than just a tad...they are like polar opposites. Either way, I like reading about it but it makes me thankful I'm no longer a teenager. Care Bears need not apply because these books are for fans of angst-filled teen drama!
