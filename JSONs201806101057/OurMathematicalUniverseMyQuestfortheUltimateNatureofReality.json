Make it stop!\"That's my girlfriend, who's just been unwise enough to let me read her a paragraph of this book. But our guest K, a local nuclear physicist, is more tolerant. \"Well,\" she smiles, \"it doesn't sound so bad. A bit exciting, a bit populistic...\" Blah blah blah. On the other hand, she isn't a native speaker of English.Okay, let's start by getting the bad news out of the way. Max Tegmark's chatty, informal, slightly manic style is on the irritating side, and if you know some physics it may also give you the impression that you're not going to learn anything from Our Mathematical Universe. Unless you're working at the cutting edge of the subject, that impression is almost certainly false. When I briefly explained the content to K, I soon found that it wasn't just a question of a few interesting details that she hadn't previously come across. Isolated like most working scientists in her own specialty, the dating of rocks using radioactive isotopes, she hadn't even heard that a major paradigm shift was under way in the theoretical basis of her field. I hope I managed to convince her that the book was well worth looking at. Yes, the style is annoying at first, but after a couple of chapters I stopped noticing it. I was in the bar, I'd had a few beers, and my new buddy Max (\"Mad Max\", he'd said, with an ironic smile) was telling me about his research, life in the charmed inner circle of theoretical physics, and his ideas about the ultimate nature of reality. Every now and then, I managed to get a word in edgeways and complain about some of the more outrageous claims. Max had evidently heard it all before, and deftly batted back my objections. I wasn't exactly convinced, but he made it sound a whole lot more plausible than I'd expected. Max's central idea is the Multiverse, where he has been one of a small number of people who's played an evangelical role. More or less considered as science-fiction fifteen years ago, it's now almost respectable; it's astonishing how quickly the change has happened. Max has a cunning scheme in which the Multiverse is presented in four increasingly bolder versions, from Level I to Level IV. I'd seen a fair amount of his material already, particularly in Brian Greene's The Hidden Reality, but Max's presentation is much better. He's worked directly on several of the key ideas, and his hands-on experience makes the stories considerably more believable. He starts off with Level I, which at first sounds innocuous.What is there in the universe? he asks. A naive answer might be that it's everything we can see through our telescopes. But even a moment's thought will prompt some revision. Sometimes there are things in the way - clouds of dust and gas along the galactic plane, for example. Surely there's something behind those clouds. Well then, the universe consists of all the things we can see, plus all the similar things we can infer must also be there.But what are those other things? Objects getting in the way is just one problem. There are also things that are very distant - so distant that light from them hasn't had time to reach us yet. How far away could these other objects be? That's a complicated question which has to do with the structure of space. Max has done a lot of work with the Cosmic Background Radiation, the light from the Big Bang, to see what it can tell us about that structure. It was fascinating to see him quickly sketching graphs on paper napkins, explaining how he'd analyzed the data and what the results told us. One key finding, as I'd heard before, is that space turns out to be flat. That means it goes on forever, so there are infinitely many more galaxies over the horizon of visibility. In that infinite expanse, every possible history has played out, including histories arbitrarily close to our own. It's sort of Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence, but in space instead of time. At some unfathomable distance (he makes a rough estimate), there are doppelgangers of Max and me, sitting in the same bar and having the same conversation. An extremely weird conclusion... but, oddly enough, it seems to follow from entirely reasonable premises.And this is only Level I. So why is the universe flat? asks Max rhetorically. Inflation? I say, as I order another round. I've seen many explanations of inflation, but it's hard to decide how seriously I should take them. Max knows all the ins and out, and argues both sides of the case. He collects some beer mats and arranges peanuts on them to demonstrate a simple argument, due to his buddy Alexander Vilenkin, that shows why inflation has to be \"eternal\". If it happened at all, it more or less had to generate an infinite number of Level I multiverses, all with different physical laws; that's Level II. But did it happen? I ask. What's the evidence? Max scribbles down more pictures of the power spectrum from the CBR, and explains how they fit the inflation scenario while ruling out a bunch of other theories. He really has that talent for showing you what the mathematics means in intuitive terms. I have to admit it: the case looks better than I'd realized.Level III is the quantum multiverse: everything that can happen, does happen. I've read several books about this and am more or less convinced already, but Max's version of it is very nice. He describes how he invented the quantum suicide thought experiment and tells me about some clever details that I should have thought of but hadn't. It's even weirder than I'd realized. And now, we need to proceed to Level IV before closing time. But surely we should get some more beer first? I mumble something about how I've maybe had enough, but Max isn't taking no for an answer. Du sa n\u00e5t om att du bott in Sverige? he says, and before I know what's happened there's a bottle of akvavit on the table between us. He pours out a couple of generous glasses.Level IV, it turns out, makes all the others look modest in comparison. Think about the fundamental particles, urges Max. We can see that they are entirely specified by their mathematical properties. So what's the simplest explanation? Reality just is mathematical structure. Every mathematical structure specifies a reality! But what breathes fire into the equations? I ask. Nothing does! says Max. Sk\u00e5l! I empty my glass, which is magically full again a moment later. The room seems to be revolving slowly. It's... uh... interesting, I say. But surely there's no way to investigate the idea empirically? Maybe! replies Max, and sketches out yet another graph, this time showing constraints on the Higgs VEV. His explanation is fiendishly clever, unless that's just the effect of the akvavit. But surely there are problems with all this? I say weakly, ashamed that I can't immediately come up with half a dozen objections. Max suddenly looks thoughtful and almost sober. The measure problem is very serious, he says. It's a crisis in physics. He and his identical twin, who's just appeared next to him, proceed to explain it. I nod every now and then and try to put my hand over my glass, but he's too quick for me.The next morning, I have no memory at all of how I got back to my hotel room, though I dimly recall Max saying something about the dangers of nuclear war, meteorites and evil AI entities. Or was that a dream? I do at any rate have a pile of paper napkins, covered in illegible scrawls and smelling strongly of akvavit.Read this book.

Wisely, he doesn't try to make the reader *cough me cough* follow his maths, but instead offers URLs for papers offering the mathematical proofs for the concepts he discusses as additional reading, for those so inclined. Tegmark walks us through the information gradually, and interspersing the heavy concepts with light personal anecdotes. His analogies are so clear and this makes the book gripping, understandable, and illuminating.3) Tegmark's writing is in fact so clear that I had a moment of the most exquisite understanding while reading it. I was lying in bed, and I started crying, because for a split second I had an clear conceptualization of the beauty of the mathematical universe, and it was vast and overwhelming and fucking gorgeous.

The author adopts (and convincingly explains) a particular version of mathematical Neo-Platonism stating that reality is essentially nothing but mathematical structures. His position might be classified as a form of mathematical \u201cmonism\u201d (as it essentially denies ontological reality to anything except mathematical objects). From a philosophical perspective, the author can be allocated to what is termed \"Ontological Structural Realism\", whose main statement (crudely expressed) is the claim that there are no \u2018things\u2019 as such, and that \u201cstructure\u201d is all there is. This approach has proved quite attractive to a few philosophers of physics, philosophers of mathematics (such as Stewart Shapiro) and physicists, and I personally find it quite compelling (my Neo-Platonism was (at least, until I finished reading this book) more of the Heisenberg or Roger Penrose flavour \u2013 the latter famously positing the existence of three worlds \u2013 the world of conscious perception, the physical world and the Platonic world of mathematical forms, interconnected in a complex fashion).The author starts his argument by observing, in a convincing way, that the very fabric of our physical world appears to be fully describable in a mathematical way. Look at \"space\" itself, for example, whose only intrinsic properties are \"mathematical\" (such as dimensionality, curvature and topology); and this equally applies to the \u201cstuff\u201d our physical world is made of \u2013 the only intrinsic properties of elementary particles are mathematical (charge, spin and lepton number, for example).I think that the author here is correct, and I must add that this debunks the myth of the Kantian \u201cthing in itself\u201d (das Ding an sich), this mysterious \u201cessence\u201d which Kant confusingly opposed to the phenomenological behaviour of the object. The most fundamental entity in classical quantum mechanics, the wave function, can be considered, after all, a mathematical object which \"lives\" in the infinite-dimensional place called Hilbert space. Fields can be considered mathematical objects, or at least spatially defined clusters of information. Just as a side note, I would have expected the author to also explore the concept of entropy, which is a fundamental, emergent phenomenon ultimately driving the time arrow evolution of the Universe, and which again is nothing but a \u201cmathematical\u201d/statistical concept based on the measure of the number of specific ways in which a system may be arranged (commonly understood as a measure of \u201cdisorder\u201d). This would have further confirmed his theory. I tend to share the author's views here: the more I have studied quantum mechanics and relativity, the more I have started to feel that the deeper you dig, the more this physical \u201cstuff\u201d starts looking like an illusion, as its fundamental core nature appears to be nothing but information and structure... \u201cmathematics\u201d, if you wish. After all, particles are excitations of the corresponding quantum fields (which are not \u201cphysical\u201d in the traditional meaning of the term), or they can be defined, in modern particle physics, as \"elements of an irreducible representation of the corresponding symmetry group\". And, after all, what does the word \u201cphysical\u201d mean ? Is it what it can be perceived by our limited sensory organs ? Well, I think that this old-fashioned concept of \"physical world\" has been made obsolete for quite some time. Moreover, the author compellingly and beautifully explains that we DISCOVER such structures fully describing reality, we do NOT invent them \u2013 all we invent is the NOTATION for describing such structures. A structure is defined as a set of abstract entities with a set of relations between them, whereby the only properties of these entities are those embodied by the relations between them: and it is clear to the author, from the latest developments in science in the last 90 years, that the properties of nature stem not from properties of its ultimate building blocks, but from the RELATIONS between such building blocks - and I find myself in substantial agreement with this view.The author, after discussing the point that the fundamental properties of reality appear to be mathematical, addresses the relationship between such mathematical structures describing reality, and reality itself. What is such relationship ? Is such relationship an isomorphism, or is it an identity? In other words, is mathematics the language of nature, or IS IT nature itself ? Here, the author thesis is that, if two structures are \u201cequivalent\u201d (where equivalence is defined as the existence of a one-to-one relationship between the two structures, preserving all relations), they are the same and they describe the one and the same thing. The author's conclusion is: \u201cthis means that if some mathematical equations completely describe both our external physical reality and a mathematical structure, then our external physical reality and the mathematical structure are one and the same\u201d. Here the author, disappointingly, does not really develop this crucial point in any satisfactory detail: he refers to the work (a master thesis) done by a certain Marius Cohen (page 280 of the book), and this is all we have. Not enough, and I was left profoundly dissatisfied here - I will try and retrieve Marius Cohen's work, but that such a crucial point was not developed in more detail remain a weakness of this book, in my opinion. But overall his points are very compelling, beautifully addressed and explained, and fascinating \u2013 a real intellectual challenge to our everyday perspective of reality.There is so much to discuss here in relation to this book - I feel I could write a book on this book, as there are so many different interesting themes and fascinating points discussed by the author.Just as an example, the author beautifully highlights how fundamental the property of \u201csymmetry\u201d is in the characterisation of mathematical structures and of reality. Also, the author addresses the issues raised by the concept of \u201cinfinity\u201d and by incompleteness (as raised by Godel), elaborating, as a response to such issues, his initial \u201cMathematic Universe Hypothesis\u201d into a \"Computable Universe Hypothesis\" (CUH), which posits that all COMPUTABLE mathematical structures exist. Fascinating, I must say.Where I disagree with him however is in his own enthusiasm for the Multiverse interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (Level III Multiverse in his book) - I found his treatment of this specific issue quite weak, and the author also makes the mistake (unfortunately still common) of interpreting Bell's inequality experimental results as ruling out hidden variables \u2013 this is not correct \u2013 what has been ruled out is the existence of hidden LOCAL variables, so alternative interpretations (in particular, the de Broglie-Bohm theory, which I personally find quite attractive, and which elegantly tries to address the measurement problem), are still not ruled out. I realize though that this particular interpretation sits in a minority position, and many do not agree with it at all.Overall, it is a great book, challenging, rich and fascinating. It even explores, with fascinating insights, hard problems such as the nature of consciousness, the issue of the potential future \"singularity\", and our place and our meaning in the Universe. To finish, I would have loved a more quantitative treatment of some of the items discussed in the book (at least in areas such as quantum mechanics and symmetry) but I guess this is part of the current commercially-driven trend of dumbing down the maths in order to enlarge the potential audience (and therefore the potential customer base) - this is (together with the couple of other shortcomings I highlighted above) why I could not give this otherwise great book a full 5 star rating."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david", "userReview": "The first half of this book is a review of modern physics on the macro and micro scales.

At the same time it is a mostly lucid walkthrough of the latest theories in physics. It's important to distinguish between theories and speculation. Theories are directly testable. Results of the theories are repeatable. Special and General Relativity are examples of theories that have been demonstrated over and over again. A result is calculated from the theory, an experiment is performed...the results match. Where the speculative part of the book comes in to play is where Tegmark attempts to project what he sees as the natural outcome, the logical result of these theories or the \"real world\" ramifications. That is to say, if the mathematical theories are accurate representations of the real world, then what must this real world look like? Really. He describes these hypotheses as \"predictions\" of theories.As an overview of the current state of physics, this is highly digestible. It's exciting to get a window into the latest thinking in cosmology and subatomic space. I'm going to focus on his speculations. According to Tegmark, the latest theories result in their being a possibility of four different types of multiverses. At the core of these propositions are two contentious suppositions.InflationThe Schrodinger Equation.I think most of us have heard that the universe is \"expanding\" although I think few of us can really envision what this means. Space is getting larger...like a balloon. However, inflation is different. Imagine taking an object and then duplicating it. Duplicate it exponential times. Then duplicate each of those duplicates exponential times. This is inflation and apparently the hypothesis that inflation occurred immediately after the Big Bang explains several big puzzles of cosmology. (At least for now.) Such as, why the background radiation is evenly distributed throughout the universe. With inflation, you get your matter for nothing and the matter comes from Energy (E=MC2) being converted. And inflation can propagate faster than the speed of light. Not all scientist are in agreement; inflation is still a hypothesis, but Tegmark points out that it neatly answers many conundrums. I did see this article recently about a discovery that could be inflation.A lot of \"could bes.\" More on inflation in a bit.The Schrodinger Equation is the mathematical formula that captures the state of a quantum particle. What it has always shown is a range of probabilities and never a defined location. When a particle is captured, it is always found in one of the positions defined by the Schrodinger Equation, and the probability of finding it in any given position can be calculated with this formula before you locate it. The Schrodinger Equation has been demonstrated to be accurate over and over again through experimentation.The mind-bending issue arises because physicists haven't been able to explain why the equation \"collapses\" when a particle is observed. That is, before observation, a particle exists only in a state of probability, it does not have an exact position (or velocity). But the moment it is observed, it assumes instantly a location. You've likely have heard of the Schrodinger Cat thought experiment (the cat being both alive and dead until observed) that demonstrates the absurdity and mind-bending nature of this result. If not, here's a description of it.How is it that the act of observation (or measurement) causes the quantum particle to assume a state? The common solution called the Copenhagan Interpretation simple says it does but not why. Observation closes the loop, end of story. What is the mechanism that causes an interaction with a probability sphere to collapse into actuality? There are now quite a few other interpretations. Such as that it never collapses, only seems to. Tegmark sees the most coherent solution to this to be the Everett Many-World's Interpretation. More on that in a bit.As a result of both the concept of inflation and the difficulty in explaining how the Schrodinger Equation relates to reality, Tegmark suggests that there are four possible conditions that may describe the universe(s). But all are preceded by the idea that if inflation is correct then space must be infinite. This an important assumption and one that there is really zero proof of, but it makes for interesting conceptual thinking. These are his \"Universe Levels.\"ONE: Given space as infinite there are infinitely many \"universe islands\" like our own. That would mean there are infinite beings just like us but different in some small or large aspects. These beings are beyond the distance that light could even travel to us since the Big Bang. In some universes, our \"duplicates\" don't exist at all. In others, our species doesn't exist or our planet. In others, everything exists exactly as it does except your eyes are purple. He claims this is the natural outcome of having infinite space along with fairly similar starting conditions. This reminds me a lot of Nietzche's Eternal Recurrence hypothesis.TWO: Same as one except that in these universe islands, the laws or constants of physics might be different. He uses the \"fine-tuning argument\" as some justification for this view. More on fine-tuning in a bit. And...each universe island may have had it's own Big Bang moment.THREE: Multiverse time....Tegmark's preferred explanation of the Schrodinger Equation is that at each moment in time when a particle can exist in different states, the universe splits into a unique universe for each potential state. All states occur and then due to \"decoherence\" they separate and cannot interact with each other. There is no state vector/equation collapse...all states occur and split us into multiple universes. These universe all exist \"simultaneously\" (doesn't really mean anything because all time exists at the same time) in an infinite Hilbert Space. The Hilbert Space is basically the uber-universe. All time and space as an unmoving object.FOUR: The Universe is a mathematical object. This is his pet preferred hypothesis. My interpretation of it is something like this: Particles can be fully described mathematically. The universe can be thought of as a collection of particles in a particular arrangement. Therefore, the universe is much like a computer program, an arrangement of numbers. The matrix. An individual life form is a complex mathematical object traveling within this mathematical universe. Kind of like a parenthesis in a larger formula Universe = (being 1) + (being 2) + etc. He essentially says that consciousness (and free will) is an illusion and is merely the sensation of experiencing the split into multiverses (I'm given the impression that he believes in Levels 2, 3, and 4 combined). And here's where it gets really weird (abstract/abstruse/absurd), he suggests that all that exists ismath. A sort of reverse Platonism. Somehow when mathematical formulas are complex enough, they become self-aware and perceive the mathematical universe as a reality. Even basic mathematical systems exist in their own universe, albeit one not complex enough for life. He gives the example of how videos are constructed from ones and zeros but give us the impression that they are real images. The universe is kind of like that. A self-contained mathematical formula that simulates reality. Although he actually doesn't believe in the simulated universe hypothesis, it seems to me to be the same thing. Math formulas take on a life of their own. Jeff Noon wrote a book called Nymphomation that was about math formulas coming to life as I recall.Unfortunately, although Tegmark presents this model, he really can't explain it. It is certainly intriguing and unanswered what reality is and how we perceive it as such...and how we could (if we do) have free will. However, it is even harder to explain how an abstract structure (a \"computationally valid\" mathematical formula) could somehow form a reality. Math is pure abstraction. So how could an abstraction perceive? How could an abstraction create a form? Saying something is \"emergent\" doesn't explain it, it's just saying that you can't explain it.The universe may be imaginary, but it sure damn feels real. How could a mathematical formula feel real? How could math develop the ability to \"feel.\" His hypothesis doesn't really explain anything. He says the theory doesn't need to explain consciousness...that's someone else's job.One justification he has for level 2 universe is the \"fine-tuning\" argument. I'm no mathematician and Tegmark is one of the top in the world apparently. So I say this with humbleness that I may be wrong...but I see a profound gulf in one simple area. It is a misunderstanding of the relationship between probability and \"real\" life. If something has actually happened, i.e., exists, then the probability of it happening is 100%. There is no probability. Before it occurs, there is a probability. Therefore, when the so-called \"fine-tuning argument\" is used as a factor to sell a theory, my back gets up. The fine tuning argument states that some constants are so \"finely tuned\" to support life, that either God tuned them (Tegmark doesn't say this but creationists do)...or there is a significant theory missing to explain why the quantities are such as they are so specifically. For example, if dark energy energy was minimally less dense then the universe would have flown apart already. If dark energy was slightly denser then it would have collapsed. Of course, dark energy hasn't even been proven to exist yet...although...there was this recently.Tegmark believes all these constants will be justified mathematically at some point. Lot of belief there. But regardless of why the constants are in the state they are, they are. There is no \"chance\" or probability that they could be anything else. So regardless of how you explain them, there is no proof that they could anything other than what they are, which means the probability of them being what they are is 1. It's not amazing that the odds turned up life. Life is. The constants are. It wasn't god who made them, nature did. I'm not saying we won't necessarily learn more which will explain why some values are what they are. I'm saying that the fine-tuning argument falls apart because probability is not relevant to the outcome. There are no \"other states.\"In the end, this book is both lucid and whimsical. It's quite entertaining and rather farfetched at the same time. After I had completed most of this review I went and read a few professional reviews on the NYTimes website, The Guardian, etc. All of these reviewers find the multiverse theory to still be bunk and unprovable and/or the mathematical universe idea to be absurd. So take it all with a grain of salt.

He starts off by, I kid you not, assuming that the external physical reality is a mathematical structure.This radical idea, that reality is \"made of math\" is embodied in the title of the book, but nowhere within the pages is there any logical argument in for the idea. It's merely assumed.This assumption is necessary to apply the rule of isomorphism to the external physical reality and the Theory of Everything, an undertaking which is supposed to provide support for the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis. But you can't start out assuming the thing you're trying to prove!Mad Max, as he's known in the physics community, has the gall to let this glaring logical error stand uncorrected. On his Facebook page, I asked him about this circular reasoning, and he dodged the question but admitted the starting assumption.It's infuriating that someone can publish a book claiming the universe is \"made of math\" and have no argument inside the book to support this outrageous claim. This isn't speculative. It's unscientific.Aside from his own pet theory, he presents an out-of-date picture of the Everett's Many Worlds interpretation as thought it were a unique theory from other interpretations of quantum mechanics. This is wrong.There's also a whole chapter full of bogus Anthropic arguments, like quantum suicide, etc. Max has got to be the sloppiest thinker who's eyes I've ever had the displeasure of being forced to see the world through.The first half of the book does contain some half-way decent introduction to cosmology, but you're better off reading a real author like Stephen Hawking or even Brian Greene.See also http://thephysicspolice.blogspot.com/..."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max", "userReview": "The title makes one feel this will be a daunting read and at times it is, but Tegmark starts out in a clear concise fashion reviewing current cosmological concepts. He provides detail on mapping the cosmic microwave-background radiation including his own considerable involvement. He describes how it mirrors our present day universe which maintains the background radiation\u2019s uniform temperatures and densities. This leads to Alan Guth\u2019s theory of inflation which explains the uniformity, flatness and the enormous size of the universe. Tegmark accepts inflation as entirely consistent with everything we know but he admits to having some qualms. If gravity waves were proven, he would be completely convinced. Still he is comfortable using inflation to build his model. From here on Tegmark begins departing from what he considers widely accepted ideas. He sees inflation coming before the big bang not after as it is usually presented. Thus the universe did not start out as some super dense super-hot entity. The heat was caused by inflation. The big bang occurred when inflation stopped. Tegmark believes inflation is always occurring in some region of space, a controversial idea called eternal inflation. This creates an infinite but still expanding universe contained in a finite volume. Those areas outside of our observable universe Tegmark calls Level I parallel universes. There are an infinite number of these parallel universes, some still inflating. The nomenclature here is what is unusual. Many physicists believe the universe is infinite, but dividing the portions we can\u2019t see into Level I parallel universes allows Tegmark to build his model. Level I parallel universes share our laws of physics and physical constants. Tegmark next posits the Level II multiverse, his term for a concept popular with string theorists. These are other finite volumes containing their own infinite parallel universes with their own laws of physics, physical constants and particle relationships. The Level II multiverse addresses the anthropic principle which holds that our universe seems to be fine-tuned to support life. With infinite universes just as with infinite planets one is bound to be just right for us.Next Tegmark explores the quantum world. Everything is made of particles (quarks, electrons, etc.) but all we know about them are the mathematical values of their attributes (charge, spin, etc.). These values arrayed in space are described by quantum field theory. Tegmark believes that there is an underlying layer of reality that we perceive as particles; perhaps strings, quantum loops or something not yet thought of. Coincidentally while reading this my January 2017 issue of Scientific American arrived with an article about a group of physicists working on quantum gravity who are collaborating with scientists involved in quantum computer development. They have formed a program called \u201cIt from Qubit\u201d to look for an underlying structure of information bits held together by entanglement that would generate space and time as its emergent property.Tegmark\u2019s take on quantum mechanics eschews the Copenhagen interpretation. He is smitten with Schrodinger\u2019s equation, but does not believe the wave function ever collapses which leads to the many-worlds theory of Hugh Everett III. This theory holds that all outcomes are real not just those that are observed. Thus reality splits. Tegmark calls these separate realities Level III parallel universes. He points to small surveys that show more physicists now believe in the many-worlds theory than in the formerly popular Copenhagen interpretation, although many don\u2019t ascribe to either theory. Tegmark describes his discussions with the famous theoretical physicist John Wheeler who died at 96 in 2008. Wheeler who coined the term black hole postulated the one electron universe that inspired his student Richard Feynman even if Feynman did not completely accept the idea. Hugh Everett and Richard Feynman had been Wheeler\u2019s doctoral students at Princeton. The many-worlds theory was Hugh Everett\u2019s doctoral thesis which Wheeler championed. From this point on, Tegmark leaves traditional thinking completely behind. He posits the Level IV multiverse which is comprised of mathematical structures. These are Tegmark\u2019s ultimate reality. Each structure generates a different universe. The mathematical structures could be anything, say a cube where the corners are connected to each other. A structure that would yield our universe would be much more complicated. Tegmark\u2019s mathematical reality is a relational reality. \u201c\u2026 the properties of the world around us stem not from the properties of its ultimate building blocks, but from the relations between these building blocks\u201d. He offers an analogy to the brain in which it is the connections between neurons that form ideas not the properties of the individual neurons. It is the relationship between the neurons that yield consciousness just as the relationships in the mathematical structure yield the universe we perceive. Tegmark points to symmetries as an important way mathematical structures produce the physical properties we perceive. Tegmark references German mathematician Emmy Noether who proved that continuous symmetries of mathematical structures produce conservation laws of physics yielding the physical constants. For example energy corresponds to time translation symmetry, momentum to space-translation symmetry, angular momentum to rotation symmetry, electric charge to a particular symmetry of quantum mechanics. Nobel Prize winner Eugene Wigner showed these symmetries dictated all the quantum properties of particles such as spin and mass.The Level IV multiverse would not just have different physical constants like Level II but different equations. This answers John Wheeler who wondered, \u201cWhy these particular equations, why not others.\u201d Or as Eugene Wigner put it \u201cThe enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious\u2026there is no rational explanation for it.\u201d Or as Stephen Hawking asked, \u201cWhat is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?\u201d Tegmark answers with the Level IV multiverse. So what can we make of all this? I have no idea how valid Tegmark\u2019s thesis is, but I thoroughly enjoyed his presentation in which I learned about new concepts and lines of thought. In the 1930\u2019s John Wheeler studied under Niels Bohr and worked alongside Einstein, two men who led revolutionary thinking in physics 100 years ago. Wheeler encouraged Tegmark writing him, \u201c...behind quantum mechanics lies some deep and wonderful principle to be discovered\u2026The likelihood of such a discovery is surely proportional to our belief that there is something there to be discovered.\u201d Before we dismiss Tegmark\u2019s wild abandon in his search for a mathematical universe, we should keep in mind that the ideas of John Wheeler, his famous students Richard Feynman and Hugh Everett, his mentor Niels Bohr and associate Albert Einstein were all considered silly at one point."}, {"userName": "Peter Mcloughlin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-mcloughlin", "userReview": "This book starts with solid science on the advancements of cosmology in the early part with a solid scientific description of the Big Bang model and gets more speculative afterwards. If you don't like to indulge in theoretical and philosophical speculation the latter part of the book might not be for you. If you are like me and relish in some deep speculation about the nature of the cosmos even if the data hasn't backed it yet then read this book it is great at that.  Tegmark explains in a relatively breezy way the latest in current cosmology which has gone from theoretical speculation to a precise science. Of course once the frontier is mapped out if you press on a little further you come to a new and stranger frontier. That is what Tegmark does. He relates the big bang model and inflationary models of the universe which were at one time not so long ago speculations but now enjoy a solid backing by the data of the last twenty years and pushes out to new speculative ideas of Multiverses. Tegmark a few years proposed not only an infinite number of parallel universes (multiverse) but came up four levels or (flavors) of multiverses. Level I infinite universe in spatial extent, Level II eternal bubbling universes forming from inflation theory, Level III an interpretation of Quantum mechanics (many world or Everettian interpretation) where every moment countless universes are dividing off this universe to a nearly infinite number of Branches (BTW mathematically if level I universe is accurate it's equivalent for all practical purposes to many worlds.) Finally the level IV multiverse in which our universe is ultimately a mathematical structure complex enough to house sentient creatures one structure among the multiverse of all possible mathematical structures. In essence we live in a small section of Plato's world of the forms.  This is all heady stuff and Tegmark delivers it in an easy to digest manner. This is the kind of book I really go for. I wish I could give it six stars.Third or fourth reading 6/14/15 This and Jim Holt's \"Why does the world exist?\" are books which captivate me.

He explores the current multiverse scenario in here. He classifies the multiverse into four categories. Level I multiverse consists of all the objects that lie beyond our cosmological horizon. Level II multiverse apparently consists of infinite number of Level I multiverses produced by inflation with different physical constants. Level III multiverse comes from the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics. Everett interpretation actually makes some intuitive sense to me. The second metaphysical part of the book where he presents his thesis is what i was looking forward to. His thesis seems to be that \"our universe is a mathematical structure\". He isn't just suggesting that our universe is described by mathematics but that it is mathematics, including us. There is nothing out there but mathematical relations, time is an illusion and nothing in the universe actually changes. This is where Level IV multiverse comes. All the structures that exist mathematically exist in the fourth level multiverse. All the structures that exist mathematically have the same ontological status.I found Tegmark's monism, an all-encompassing mathematical multiverse to be very appealing.He comes to his idea of mathematical universe by reducing an empirical physical model of universe to mathematics. So for example, from what i understand, there are no objects such as quarks and leptons, but there are groups and the properties of quarks are described by the group. From this and considering the explanatory power of mathematics, a mathematical universe does make some intuitive sense. Perhaps the reason why mathematics is so successful in explaining our universe is because they are one and the same. I\u2019m not sure that he made a convincing argument if everything can be reduced to mathematics ontologically. What about an emergent property like consciousness? His suggestion of mathematical self-aware structures didn't tell me much and his conjecture that Consciousness is a state of matter didn't make much sense to me. I never really understood what he means when he talks about subjective randomness and subjective immortality either. To whom is it subjective?A lot of criticism for this book, as it seems to me, is that his theory is not \"scientific\". While i agree with this, it doesn't bother me. While there is nothing new or radical about Tegmark's mathematical monism, I was actually hoping that this book would be more mathematically and philosophically enlightening. But unfortunately there isn't much discussion about mathematical structures in here and this isn't a very good metaphysical treatise either.

Several variations on the theme tell us that there must be an infinite number of versions of our Universe (capital \u201cU\u201d), other universes (small \u201cu\u201d), some indistinguishable from our own, some with minor differences, many with significant differences. separated from us in space or time. But Tegmark is careful not to frighten his readers by making such seemingly outrageous claims at the start of his book. Instead, he leads us gently by the hand through the traditional story of our place in the Universe, from the Sun and Solar System outwards, before wading into deeper waters. Even this familiar story is enlivened by the author\u2019s personal touch, with anecdotes from his childhood and early life in research. So by the time he gets to the tricky bit, he feels like an old and trustworthy friend. This is just as well, because things get very tricky indeed. The first step into deep water is the easiest. If space is infinite, our visible Universe can be regarded as a bubble within that infinite space, analogous to the bubble of visibility surrounding a person walking through a fog. It is possible to calculate the number of particles (neutrons, protons and the like) in that bubble, and to calculate the number of ways they could be arranged. This is an enormous number, but, crucially, it is not infinite. So in infinite space, there must be other bubbles -- other universes -- with exactly the same arrangement of particles as in our Universe. This is the Type I multiverse, and it is almost common sense. The Type II multiverse is only slightly more complicated. It takes on board the currently-favoured idea of inflation, which explains the present appearance of our Universe as resulting from an epoch of very rapid expansion at the time of the Big Bang. Each universe is an inflating bubble within some kind of superspace. But it is the Type III multiverse that is familiar from science fiction. This is where quantum physics comes in to the story, with Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s famous \u201cdead and alive cat\u201d and the idea that every time the world is faced with a choice of possibilities at the quantum level it splits to allow all possible developments. In fact, no \u201csplitting\u201d is required, and it is equally valid, as Schr\u00f6dinger himself pointed out, to think of all quantum possibilities existing alongside each other \u201call the time\u201d, whatever that means in this context. Let me spell that out. In the famous thought experiment, a (purely hypothetical) cat is trapped in a box with a quantum device that ensures that it has a 50:50 chance of being dead or alive. When the box is opened, one possibility is realised. The \u201csplitting\u201d idea says that at that moment the Universe divides in two, one universe with a dead cat and one with a live cat. The \u201cparallel\u201d idea says that there are always two universes, each initially with a cat in the same situation, in one of which the cat dies while in the other it lives, with no splitting involved. \u201cParallel universes,\u201d says Tegmark, \u201care not a theory, but a prediction of certain theories.\u201d All of this is allowed -- some would say, required -- by the known law of physics, or as Tegmark prefers, the known laws of mathematics. As Galileo said, nature is \u201ca book written in the language of mathematics\u201d. But Tegmark isn\u2019t finished yet, He goes on (farther than most physicists would) to consider the Type IV multiverse, in which different universes are governed by different laws of mathematics. This leads on to speculation about the nature of reality and our place in it, the future of life and the future of the Universe. All a far cry from early chapters on our place in the Universe, and discussion of the sizes of planets and stars, but somehow a natural development, thanks to Tegmark\u2019s gift for storytelling, from those beginnings. As he says, \u201cphysics is the ultimate intellectual adventure\u201d; this is a great place to join in that adventure.John Gribbin is a Visiting Fellow in Astronomy at the University of Sussex and author of In Search of the Multiverse (Penguin)"}, {"userName": "Mohamed al-Jamri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri", "userReview": "This is Max Tegmark's first and only book so far. In the book, Max who likes to be called Mad Max proposes a really \"mad\" theory of everything called the \"mathematical universe hypothesis\" in which he argues that the ultimate nature of reality is mathematics. He also argues strongly for the multiverse idea, making it somewhat plausible.The book is written with a mostly smooth and easy to understand narrative style that is often combined with inspirational quotations. It is from books like this that I get the feeling to want to do physics instead of medicine, even though I'm few weeks/months away from final year examinations. The author takes us through his personal quest for the ultimate nature of reality in which you'll see Einstein and Darwin next to Plato and Pythagoras. The book is divided into three parts: physics of the big and small, mathematics as reality and philosophical reflections. The first chapters are the most beautiful in the book; I got immersed in them just like I do in an Orwell novel.We are told about the ancient Greek scientists Eratosthenes and Aristarchus and their scientific discoveries made form limited observations. How just looking at a specter of a star can tell us so much information about it. He also asks 16 deep questions such as what is space, what is the curvature of the universe, how can triangles be more or less than 180 degrees, how did galaxies, atoms and elements form and what we don't know yet. He then continues with the history of scientific discoveries, going through Copernicus, Galileo, Giordano Bruno, Kepler, Newton, Hubble, Freidman and others. A recurring theme is that of not taking one's theory seriously and to its full consequences. We see multiple scientists making the same mistake through the ages. He explains the inflation theory, which is the current mainstream theory to explain the Bang in the Big Bang. Here he makes the same point made by Hawking and Krauss in their recent books, that from a quantum vacuum we can get so much mass without breaking the law of conservation of energy. He calls it a galactic Ponzi scheme in which we borrow indefinitely from gravity. Then he moves from the mainstream to purse the multiverse idea, which is enjoying much more support by physicists than it did decades ago when it was in the realm of science fiction only. He divides the multiverse into four levels and explains them. He maintains that while the multiverse is not testable/falsifiable, it is still science, because it's not a theory in it self, but a prediction of a testable theory; infinite inflation and quantum physics. He is critical of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics and supports a Cosmological interpretation that is similar to the Many-worlds interpretation.After that he reaches the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis which supports a level four multiverse, in which there is an infinite number of universes with their own set of fundamental laws of physics. The hypothesis states that mathematical structures are eternal and unchanging. They don't exist in time and space, rather space and time exist in some of them. The flow of time, creation and destruction are illusions, since change is an illusion. Mathematical existence = physical existence. He states and argues that this hypothesis is very simple and is testable/falsifiable.In the last chapter, Tegmark tackles the future of the universe and how it could end. He talks about the existential threats to life on Earth from outside and inside, nature and human. He spends some time talking about artificial intelligence, the importance of education, the meaning of life and extraterrestrial intelligence. The first parts of the book are absolutely amazing. I'd have given it 5 stars if it didn't contain some boring and hard to understand parts in the middle. Nevertheless, the book is really good and I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Wes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10784362-wes", "userReview": "Dr. Max Tegmark\u2019s \u201cOur Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality\u201d is an awe-inspiring journey into the \u201cweirdness\u201d that is reality (Tegmark\u2019s phrase). Forget everything you think you know about the place we inhabit; through engaging and friendly prose, Tegmark shows that seeing and believing are often wrong and that reality is something beyond our strangest dreams. If seeing the world (universe) as a grand landscape of seeming impossibilities sounds enjoyable, then this book is for you. Buckle up, strap in, and prepare to explore regions of reality that are almost beyond conception.The book leads with a brief history of our understanding of the universe and our place in it \u2013 from earth as the center of the universe through big bang cosmology. The key point Tegmark makes is that each time we are able to perceive more of the universe, we are stunned by the size and scope of the cosmos. Put another way, our understanding of the universe has increased at intervals and with breathtaking realizations. Throughout the book, Tegmark boldly extrapolates mathematical predictions to counteract humanity\u2019s tendency toward chronic underestimation.For example, a particularly bold section focuses on our cosmic origins. Specifically, Tegmark explains Alan Guth\u2019s model of how the universe grew since the big bang by \u201cinflationary cosmology\u201d or \u201cinflationary growth.\u201d Inflationary growth solves a number of problems in physics and has been allegedly confirmed by recent gravity wave detections (BICEP2 project). Tegmark\u2019s characteristic bold extrapolation begins when he discusses the full implications of inflation, and this is where the book gets really fun. Inflation predicts that we inhabit an infinite space with infinite matter contained in a finite volume and created in a finite time. A truly infinite space with infinite matter implies that somewhere at an incomprehensibly far distance away, matter is arranged as an exact copy of earth \u2013 with an identical history \u2013 with an identical you \u2013 reading this very review \u2013 right at this very moment. Of course there would be many more \u201cnear copies\u201d of you, many more than the exact copies, but there are exact copies nonetheless. As such, inflation predicts \u201cparallel universes,\u201d where there are infinitely many exact copies of you. As crazy as this idea sounds, this isn\u2019t kooky crackpot science; this appears to be the cosmos we inhabit based on our most advanced models. Tegmark calculates that your nearest doppelganger is 10 to the power 10 to the power 115 meters away. Say hello to your doppelganger that is saying hello to you at this very moment.This is one of many ideas that show how odd reality truly might be. Reality on our \u201cscale\u201d is intuitive because our brains developed to deal with problems on the scale of biological life. But if we zoom way out or zoom way in, what we find can be described in no other way than just plain \u201cweird.\u201d That, to me, is a lot of fun. Life and the universe is a Lewis Carroll-esque landscape of seeming impossibilities and counterintuitive realities that are simply awe-inspiring. Tegmark\u2019s bold extrapolation and continued expositions on physical weirdness continues through what he terms a four level \u201cmultiverse:\u201d levels of the universe that exist but are unreachable. The Level One multiverse is predicted by inflation and contains you and your doppelganger, etc.; the Level Two multiverse is areas of space where fundamental natural constants are different due to fluctuations at the big bang (example: parts of space with 7 dimensions, sub atomic charges are different, etc.); the Level Three multiverse is predicted by Hugh Everett\u2019s \u201cmany worlds\u201d interpretation of quantum mechanics; and the Level Four multiverse is predicted by Tegmark\u2019s \u201cMathematical Universe Hypothesis\u201d (\u201cMUH\u201d).Tegmark's personal and most controversial theory is the MUH. The MUH theorizes that the universe is not only described by mathematics, but that it *is* mathematics, specifically, a mathematical structure. Tegmark asserts that sub-atomic \u201cparticles,\u201d (say, an electron) are described solely by their mathematical characteristics and relationships. As such, an electron is not really a particle at all \u2013 but simply a mathematical object whose relationships are governed by various mathematical features (a number representing charge, lepton number, etc.). We give the electron a \u201cparticle\u201d designation because it is intuitive, but in reality there is nothing there but mathematics. So at its most basic, the universe is an elaborate structure of mathematical relationships between entities whose sole characteristics are mathematical ones. Electrons, quarks, photons, molecules, our bodies and minds, solar systems, galaxies, etc., are mathematical objects that move and dance according to their mathematical properties. If you\u2019re having trouble believing this one, don\u2019t worry, the theory remains highly controversial. But I think you get the idea: reality is mathematics.The MUH tells us that the multiverse is something akin to a DVD \u2013 it has always existed and will always exist with the information content contained therein. That means that in a sense, you, a self-aware mathematical substructure, have always existed and will always exist. You experience time as flowing subjectively as you process mathematical relationships between and among other mathematical substructures, including the mathematical substructure that makes up your physical self. Put another way, your reality model as a self-aware substructure observes mathematical relationships that change according to other mathematical relationships. Without an observer, these relationships are essentially timeless, have always existed and will always exist. Time subjectively appears fleeting and irreversible because our reality model is governed by mathematical relationships. But in reality, you have always and will always exist mathematically, on repeat, forever.If this notion holds true, then it has important philosophical implications something akin to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche\u2019s idea of \u201ceternal recurrence.\u201d Philosophers have tackled the question of infinity and some have deduced that in infinite space and time our physical selves occur repeatedly through \u201ceternal recurrence.\u201d This idea is summed up in the following quotation by Nietzsche: \u201cAnd then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more . . . the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring [universe] in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever.\u201d My personal takeaway from the MUH is to simply live a happy life and live the life you want to live. Our intuition tells us that we only get one chance \u2013 so we should be doing this anyway \u2013 but this one chance may be the life you are destined to repeat forever and ever.I should conclude by saying that many of Tegmark\u2019s ideas are controversial and that we shouldn\u2019t necessarily take what authority figures say as true, even when such figures are so clearly brilliant. Still, the journey through the mind of one of the most renowned scientists today is nothing short of exceptional, even if taken with a grain of salt.P.S. There is also a small chance that our entire universe is a computer simulation being run by an ultra-intelligent entity.

From here, they got the idea that everything in the world can be measured and described by numbers, and that \"all is number\" In this book Tegmark using theoretical physics, he wanted to show us something similar, but in scientific way not mystic, in a journey from the vast infinite space to the tiniest particle inside our brains (which are part of the journey)This book stands in three parts. Part one talked about space in general and our place in it, putting us in the most recent (sometimes most complex) problems of modern cosmology.He showed us how the Inflation Theory by Alan Guth solved these problems such as the horizon problem and the flatness problem.The inflation theory says that our baby Universe grew much like a human baby, an accelerating growth phase where the size doubled at regular intervals was followed by a more leisurely decelerating growth phase.So where and when did this inflation end?! Indeed it ended 14 billion years ago, in the part of space that we now inhabit, This means that there must be some physical process which can get rid of the inflating substance, causing it to decay into ordinary non-inflating matter, which then keeps expanding, clustering, and ultimately forming galaxies, stars and planets.Alex Vilenkin Professor of Physics and Director of the Institute of cosmology at Tufts University, found that the question of where and when inflation ends is quite subtle and interesting. We know that inflation ends in at least some places, since 14 billion years ago, it ended in the part of space that we now inhabit, No not our planet, neither our galaxy, but our universe. Inflation theory gave us the Level I and Level II Multiverse which occupy the first part of the book.Part tow talked about the subatomic world, it gives us a new picture of the current Standard Model(new at least for me), and produced the level III of multiverse(The Quantum Multiverse).Tegmark used the analogy of Schrodungar's cat experiment and made what he called The Quantum Card thought experiment and showed how you can be in quantum superposition(in tow places at once) Part Three is the heart core of the book in this part Tegmark showed how mathematics by means of numbers and symbols can describe out physical world precisely, I will quote the author to be more sincerely and to avoid falling in troubles: \"The fabric of our physical reality contains dozens of pure numbers which all measurement constants can in principle be calculated\"\"Our reality isn't just described by mathematics ,it is mathematics not just aspects of it, but all of it, including you.\"\"our external physical reality is a mathematical structure\" Tegmark called this the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis(MUH) call it Hypothesis number one.The External Reality Hypothesis (ERH)(number tow) stands that \"There exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans.\"Tegmark's argument is that our most successful theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics describe only part of the reality, for a complete description of external reality must be defined in a form \"devoid of any human baggage like 'particle', 'observation' or other words\" in other words it have to be a Mathematical Structure .Thus everything physical is ultimately mathematical, including you and me, \"making us self-aware parts of a giant mathematical object\". This means that all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well, forming the Level IV multiverse (this is a mind blowing conclusion)\"Exploring the Level IV multiverse doesn't require rockets or telescopes, merely computers and ideas\". (reminds me of Berekley)\"Mathematical structures, formal systems and computations are closely related, suggesting that they\u2019re all aspects of the same transcendent structure whose nature we still haven\u2019t fully understood\"Now the question of whatever we have to believe in all of this or not, one simply can be narrow minded and reject all of it, ,another one influenced by Popper's thought, can say that this is unscientific non-sense and can't be tested or falsified, for my part I found this Level VI Multiverse a little bit strange (as another levels) but worth thinking .Tegmark as he said moved the thinking of Multiverse from \" this is non-sense I hate it \" to \"I hate it\"The book was complex and hard to follow in some parts (and hard to remember in all parts), but it was \"Fantastic\" in every sense of the word."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7133444-sandra", "userReview": "[we are told why it is not (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3849889-linda", "userReview": "The human mind has constantly underestimated the size of our world and universe, while, at the same time, the human mind has constantly underestimated the chances of understanding it. Max Tegmark, one of the leading physicists in the world, explains theories about the universe and offer alternative conclusions which are considered controversial, but gain more and more acceptance and respect. He doesn't think the universe can be described by mathematics, he thinks it is mathematics. The smallest parts of the atom that we know of, the quarks, have no other quality than being mathematic. In the same way, the universe on the great scale seems to be symmetrical and consist of equations. The big and the small scales come together, and in the end, everything is mathematics.Max Tegmark is a very interesting person, obviously very intelligent, interested in mysteries and the unexplainable, and has a great deal of open-minded imagination. That makes him a machine of ideas and theories about our universe. His determination is impressive. When he finds an obstacle, he writes a new computer program to be able to analyze data, or builds a groundbreaking kind of telescope - an omniscope, involving a method called 21 cm cosmology - to be able to continue his research.This book brings out the physicist in you. Tegmark mixes equations and explanations with the big, existential questions. Sometimes the book is on the verge of philosophy, which only makes physics more beautiful. What are we, really? What makes us aware of everything and ourselves? Do we exist or are we just Boltzmann brains? (A self aware entity, existing due to fluctuations in space, according to quantum mechanics). What is reality? Is time an illusion? In which universe do we live? What does the world really look like? How accurate is our view when we depend on photons? (In the dark, we see nothing. Different materials absorb different light waves and the colour we see seems to be the one not absorbed. Much of the reality is hidden from us, like other dimensions).This is some of the themes discussed in the book.* Time is a fascinating dimension, belonging to the four dimensions of our universe. The speed of time moves differently depending on the whereabouts of the observer. Near a black hole, it goes faster. We are able to see almost 14 billion years back in time, when viewing the cosmic radiation created 400 000 years after the Big Bang. * Hydrogen gives off radio waves with a wavelength of 21 centimeters. Since the waves reaches earth are stretched out by the expending universe, the length of them reveals how far away they come from. Since distance is a factor of time, that also reveals how old they are. It's called 21 cm tomography. It's a current scientific activity and physicists around the world are trying to track the signal from the places farthest away.* Without three dimensions and time, woven together in a cosmic fabric of spacetime, life wouldn't exist, but according to Tegmark, we are not unique. Because of his theory about multiple universes, everything that can happen, will happen somewhere.* According to Tegmark, there are universes on four levels. Our universe is on the first level, and is represented by how far we are able to see, or the light that has reached us in 14 billion years. Beyond that, there are other universes that we can't see. The universes on level two are a consequence of a great expansion happening before Big Bang, called the inflation theory. These universes have different physical rules depending on inflation and early fluctuations. Universes on level three are coming from quantum physics. Universes on level four are made of every mathematical structure there is. Every equation happens somewhere, and imagination is the limit.* According to quantum physics, there are endless copies of you that have your memories and think they are you. When you gamble, somewhere one of you win, and one of you loose. There are no luck, there are only different outcomes. When you feel immortal, it means the number of you have diminished. When you feel lucky, the number of you have increased.In one chapter, the apocalypse is discussed and five alternatives for the universe apocalypse are introduced. They are called Big Chill, Big Crunch, Big Rip, Big Snap and Death Bubbels. The theories have to do with the expanding or eventual compressing of the universe. When considering an apocalypse within a billion years, Tegmark thinks the sun is the big threat. He almost dismisses the idea of an invasion from intelligent life in our galaxy, since the probability of a planet with intelligent life existing within our galaxy, considering the immense size of the rest of the universe, is almost non-existent. (In the same way, one could argue that mankind will not live for billion years. The probability of us being born so early in that kind of time-line is very small). Many planets are inhabitable, but are still not inhabited. Many planets are older than earth, and if there were intelligent life somewhere in our galaxy, some of them would probably already have colonized the universe. Or, perhaps they already have?In the near future, however, the existential risks are the biggest threat, considering nuclear weapons and the fact that we eventually might build an intelligent computer, which earns some egoistical person much money and leaves the rest of the world in poverty. The artificial intelligence might be well beyond ourselves, and learn how to evolve without us, which makes us superfluous and ultimately might lead to our extinction. We should be grateful to what we have and not waste it. We should be able to save ourselves and our planet with knowledge. Tegmark thinks that scientists have failed to educate people and have to improve their information distribution. Many people still think that mankind is only 10000 years old, and in 2012, twelve people were burned to death for witchcraft in Haiti. The lack of knowledge is dangerous and certain companies strive to maintain ignorance to profit.Despite his successful career, Max Tegmark seems to be a very modest and humble man, fully aware of the risks of theories, and that research has turned out to be wrong before. That is why he has an open mind. His attitude and love for his work, his collegues and previous scientists is admiring. Perhaps scientists have to really love their work, be their work, to succeed. Often, they work day and night, struggling with their thesis and experiments, to be able to finally reach a conclusion.Tegmark's view of the world is fascinating and very inspiring. He mentions facts that are very romantic, almost like poetry. Gold is produced when a star dies in a supernova explosion so violent and rare that, during a fraction of a second, it releases about the same amount of energy as every other star in our observable universe, together. The world needs school teachers like that. The only criticism might be the sometimes fast deductions in his arguments. It would have been nice with a few more sentences with distinct explanations about the consistency in some of the chapters.The gigant distances, mystery, beauty and elegance of the universe often make us feel small and insignificant. We are not. First, we have a big decision to make. During our lifetime, the future of our planet is most likely to be decided, according to the book, and we will be remembered for it in the future. Second, as Tegmark so delicately puts it, the universe \u2013 which is a true art - is only beautiful because a conscious being can perceive it. We are probably the only intelligent beings in our galaxy, and if we weren't here, the beauty of the universe would be a waste of space. Instead of thinking the universe is giving meaning to us, we should think that we are giving meaning to the universe."}, {"userName": "Brian Clegg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg", "userReview": "I find myself in the strange position of awarding five stars to a book that has plenty of content with which I disagree. The detail of that will come up later, but the reason that I can still confidently give this book five stars is that it is a great read, covers some less controversial aspects of physics and cosmology very well and where Max Tegmark strays into concepts that many don't accept, he does so in a way that really makes you think, and analyse just why these concepts seem so unlikely - which is great.The book is an exploration of the development of Tegmark's leading edge (or wacky, depending on your point of view) ideas - I should stress, though, whether or not he's right, Tegmark is a respected physicist, not a random person with no knowledge to back up his ideas. The book includes an excellent pass through the development of the current hot big bang with inflation theory that it would be worth buying for without the rest. In his introduction, Tegmark says that regular popular science readers might want to skip these first few chapters, but I really recommend that you don't - for instance, he gives the best explanation and exploration of the concept of inflation I've ever seen in a popular science book. It's superb.From then on, though I don't necessarily accept what Tegmark has to say, he gives a very engaging picture of the way that the concept of eternal inflation could produce a multiverse with a infinite collection of big bangs, each producing their own universe, an impassioned plea for the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory and a really impressive attempt to persuade us that the universe isn't just described by mathematics, but is fundamentally mathematical at its heart.To be honest, you can stop there and go and buy it if you like. But I do have to say why, personally, I'm not very convinced by anything Tegmark says once he leaves the mainstream. I also have a couple of niggles about the book, which I'll get out of the way first. I found the bits about his personal life more distracting than helpful (though I know publishers love this kind of thing). He several times refers to the detailed colour picture of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation that is shown on the cover. As you can see from the image above, if this is correct, then the universe is a whole lot more interesting that I thought it was. It's a shame the text wasn't updated to reflect the new edition. Also, the BICEP2 results form quite a big piece of evidence in favour of his view of inflation - unfortunately the book seems to have been published just before these were effectively dismissed, which would put Tegmark's reflections on BICEP in a very different light.I won't spend too much on what I wasn't convinced by in the content, but a few key points are that he makes several deductions from infinity which I don't think can be justified (you have to be very careful, deducing things from infinity), for all his enthusiasm I wasn't sold on the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and I think in the final part of the book he makes the common error of conflating models and reality.However, as I mentioned up front, I didn't care - because even when I didn't agree with him, I found the book really made me think. Which surely is a mark of class."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1038866-alexandra", "userReview": "[Last book I read about quantum mechanics left me musing on \"why does probability theory work?\" When I mentioned it to a friend, he recommended this book. And it does contain an answer - everything happens and what we perceive as randomness is basically combinatorics, where you get to see just one combination. Very cool.I don't mind being a mathematical structure. Not better or worse than being a skin bag full of flesh, blood and bones or a set of atoms. Mathematical structure theory also solves for one of my favorite puzzles. Infinity is very hard to imagine and as the author pointed out, there are all kind of problems with infinities. However, as long as you declare something finite, you face \"what's outside?\" question which leads only back to infinity. MUH nicely solves it with abstraction. Mathematical structure just is, it's not infinite and not finite, and there is nothing \"outside of it\". Also, I like that it's not introducing \"universe splitting\" mechanism (it always bothered me where the energy for those extra universes are coming from in such an abundance), but all the universes are right there, in the structure.Oh, and the idea that dark energy and dark matter decay into normal matter - I am totally sold on that one. It's so elegant that I can't argue against it.However...My first objection is to the \"everything happens\" rule is that it kind of makes evolution and intelligence very questionable. So, if you have this wonderful subjective immortality... what kind of intelligence will be there? Will you have \"suicidal\" species? Are lemmings just making rational decisions in another universe that happen to be fatal in ours?The same objection to the \"bird view\" of time. If time is not flowing, and not just everything that can happen will happen, but in a way already happened, when why all the choices? Even illusion of choices? Evolution and natural selection are wonderful powerful things, they really work. How a mathematical structure can contain such a contradiction - information processing units constantly worrying about something that's totally static? If anything, it's a waste of energy.Also, the author arrived unexpectedly to the same place the theologists of the old times arrived too. If you have the almighty all-knowing deity, what's the point of human worries? Is there a free will? Can you really say the human is making any decisions when you have GOD (or a mathematical structure describing the future). And the conclusion they had is the also the same as the author had - you should just ignore all that and judge humans by their own actions. Bingo. What good is the theory if the only outcome of it is to ignore it?Another problem with the \"static time\" is that the time does flow one way only, it's not just subjective human feeling. I think, infinite expansion is the first theory where I've heard about \"taking energy from the future\". But if the time flow is an illusion we should have discovered information or energy leaking from the future to the present by now. We see plenty of things from the past - explosions happened billion years ago, white noise from the beginning of our Universe's time, but nothing, nothing, from the future. Why can't this mathematical structure let information flow the other way if that information already exists? Time paradoxes should not matter, for each time paradox you can have as many parallel universes as you wish with different outcomes based on that information from the future. (It would be cool to discover that \"dark energy\" is the energy from the future. In this case, I will turn to a firm believer).And the mathematics part. I am not a mathematician or a physicist, but I am from the computer science branch of the world, not so far away from those parts. From where I look, mathematics is not describing the reality that well. For example, show me an ideal circle anywhere. It kind of... doesn't exist. To the level that if you see something that looks like an ideal circle, it's probably made by humans. Everything else is ... an ellipse, like orbits, only not quite 100% either, because you need to correct for gravitational pull from here or there... And the Earth is not really a sphere, but it's own shape that is almost like a sphere, but not quite.... I can't see how zooming out and zooming in bring you to those ideal complex mathematical structures, but in the middle you have this mess. If everything is just a projection of a more complex mathematical structures, I would expect those projections to be more simple and elegant... and a circle to be a circle in most cases.And don't forget that our two most prominent theories (relativity and quantum mechanics, of course) do not converge - most of all mathematically.The only rule that keeps repeating itself is randomness aka probabilities theory. That one shows up everywhere - from cosmic radiation to mutations to social studies to mass service systems. And it works on micro and macro level just the same. So far, this is my personal major suspect to be the first clue for the Theory of Everything. Interestingly, the author points out that if someone will prove that randomness is a feature of the universe (vs \"everything happens\") it will be the end of his MUH. I am putting my money of that one.PS I wish I really had a chance to chat with this guy in a bar, seriously.

This book is an exceptionally eye-opening read containing new, fresh concepts and unbelievable {sometimes shocking} insights. \u2018Our Mathematical universe\u2019 covers topics such as cosmology,unique philosophy and the nature of reality. It delves into scientific topics such as \u2018the Big Bang\u2019 and the beginning of creation and life itself, to our future and the existence of parallel worlds {both sub-atomic and intergalactic}. This supremely singular study could be classed as a science-fiction sub-genre if it were not for the use of mathematics which the author relies heavily on; for explanation of theories and a deeper understanding. So many of our deepest questions are attempted to be answered, with Max Tegmark using mathematics such as for instance; the scope of reality, what everything is made of and why our universe is the way it is. Including many charts/ graphs and diagrams alongside facts to back up the hypothesis, this truly is an in-depth look into our world written by such a visionary masterful author. Anyone who is interested in finding out more about our world and the unexplained will be dazzled by this engaging, credible book as too will those sceptics who seek answers to all the riddles. If you like books by Professor Brian Cox then this is an ideal read for you! I am so pleased to have won a copy of \u2018Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality by Max Tegmark\u2019 through a Goodreads, first-read giveaway.

His undergraduate education was at KTH in Stockholm. He did graduate work in Cosmology at Berkley and spent some time at Princeton working with John Wheeler. In this book he reviews many of the extraordinary results, obtained in the last few decades, of research into the origins of the Universe. The later part of the book is much more speculative and even metaphysical. Many in the physics community may find some of his ideas out of the bounds of the scientifically provable. Still it makes for a roller coaster ride into the unknown and at least to this reader quite an exciting one at that. For me one of the highlights was one of the rare well done explanations of the so called many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. This is frequently misunderstood both in the popular science and even in the physics community. I would consider this a must read for anyone puzzled by the idea of \"collapse\" of the wave function. Aside from this, Tegmark provides a very personal and amusing account of his experiences as both a student and a working professional. He also reveals that he is the son of the well known Mathematician, Harold S. Shapiro. He tells us that he switched his last name to his Swedish mother's maiden name in order to escape being confused with the many Shapiros working in physics. For maximum benefit the book requires some effort on the part of the reader. Even if one is not happy about the more speculative latter parts the book is worth its price for the parts that clearly explain much of modern cosmology."}, {"userName": "Squatting Erudite", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-squatting-erudite", "userReview": "As a physics student, I'm constantly searching for extraordinary books with wild enough ideas to help me choose my path in physics and drive me mad with brilliant questions and mind-boggling theories about the nature of Nature.Unfortunately, those books are rare gems... but this is definitely one of them.

What\u2019s a philosophical theory about the nature of the universe if it doesn\u2019t ruffle some feathers? No one wants to write a book and then have everyone turn around and shrug at you. That doesn\u2019t sell! So it\u2019s not really surprising that Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality is a controversial book by a somewhat controversial physicist. I received this as a Christmas gift a few years ago, and that was the first I\u2019ve heard of Max Tegmark. Since then he has popped up a few times here or there, and now I\u2019ve finally made time to read this long and detailed treatise on the current state of physics and Tegmark\u2019s personal conception of, well, reality.I don\u2019t actually find it all that controversial, per se\u2014though I should clarify that I\u2019m a mathematician by training, and not a physicist, so maybe the way Tegmark presents these ideas is more insulting or seems more radical when one is a physicist. That being said, I\u2019m also not saying I agree with Tegmark\u2019s Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH), because, despite probably being a mathematical realist, Platonism itself strangely makes me uncomfortable\u2026.Oh boy, I think I\u2019ve already used too many strange terms! This review is probably going to get pretty heady and philosophical at some point, much like Our Mathematical Universe does. So let me spend the first part here just discussing the book, its structure and writing, etc., in a more general way, to give you an idea of whether or not it is of interest to you before you read my whole review. I\u2019ll get to my thoughts about Tegmark\u2019s specific claims later.Firstly, regardless of any reservations I might have, I still recommend this book. This is a really well-written and approachable popular science work. Tegmark\u2019s style is really accessible\u2014despite going heavy on scientific and mathematical terminology, he is careful to proceed in a systematic way. This is not a book you want to be reading just before bed, maybe, or during a busy commute\u2014it took me pretty much a week, albeit a busy week, to work my way through it. Nevertheless, I think it is a worthwhile use of one\u2019s time.Tegmark first impressed me with a table at the end of Chapter 1 called \u201cHow to read this book\u201d. He lists every chapter of the book, along with three columns: Science-curious reader, hard-core reader of popular science, and physicist. Each column lists the chapters that reader would be best to read/skip\u2014i.e., the science-curious reader should read the entire book; the hard-core reader can skip several of the earlier chapters because they presumably will have seen these explanations before; and the physicist can skip all but the controversial chapters (Tegmark also labels each chapter as \u201cmainstream\u201d, \u201ccontroversial\u201d, or \u201cextremely controversial\u201d). I love this approach and hope more popular science authors use it. Now, I, of course, ignored these suggestions and read the whole book anyway, because I wanted to see how Tegmark explained the Big Bang, inflation, etc. Yet I confess I skimmed some parts and felt better about it because I knew it was sanctioned.One reason I\u2019ll recommend this book is simply because Tegmark\u2019s explanations for the origins of our universe, as currently understood by \u201cmainstream\u201d cosmology, are really lucid. He clarified several aspects of the Big Bang and inflation that, until now, I not only did not understand but didn\u2019t realize I didn\u2019t understand. He didn\u2019t just improve my comprehension: he actually showed me parts of my comprehension of these theories that were inaccurate. I am not a physicist by training by any stretch of the imagination (I only took physics up to Grade 12 in high school, and they don\u2019t even get into relativity by then, let alone QM); all of this knowledge is entirely autodidactic, and hence it isn\u2019t surprising a lot if it is inaccurately understood. But I think I\u2019ve plateaued a lot lately because I was having trouble finding explanations that were calibrated for my knowledge level: either the explanations get too technical and lose me, or else I just end up reading the same ground-floor \u201chey have you heard of this thing called the double-slit experiment?\u201d stories over and over again, which isn\u2019t fun either.In particular, I really enjoyed Chapter 5, in which Tegmark explains inflation and why it is necessary to account for problems with the Big Bang theory. The idea of the Big Bang itself is now probably within the realm of general public knowledge, assuming a half-decent education (and regardless of whether one \u201caccepts\u201d the theory or prefers creationist nonsense). Yet there are probably as many misconceptions about this theory as there are explanations of it in popular science books, and once any two non-cosmologists start talking about it, we inevitably run into quasi-philosophical walls. Tegmark very clearly presents what the theory actually says; why it is compelling given the evidence; the problems with the theory without inflation and why inflation itself solves those problems.Tegmark refers a lot to data gathered by several satellites and ground-based microwave telescopes that have observed the Cosmic Background Microwave Radiation (CBMR). He himself worked quite a bit on many of these projects, or with the data from these projects, to help sharpen and analyze this evidence. And this is another reason I enjoyed and recommend Our Mathematical Universe: Tegmark provides a great perspective on how science is done. From conferences to international projects poring over satellite data to writing and publishing papers, Tegmark shows us the act of physics research as much as the end result. He shows us how individual physicists\u2019 opinions of theories will evolve over time. He shows us how people have different specializations, which in turn lead to different predilections and levels of knowledge about parts of physics. It\u2019s really fascinating, and it\u2019s an aspect to the discourse around science that I wish more media would cover.So the first 6 or 7 chapters of this book are excellent, and I recommend reading at least those. After Chapter 8, Tegmark introduces the more \u201ccontroversial\u201d content. As I said above, I don\u2019t see it as controversial so much as a bundle of claims that are either uninteresting because they are obvious or unappealing because they are largely unintelligible. Now we arrive at the part of the review that gets technical.Let me refer you to Scott Aaronson\u2019s review. He is a computer scientist and much more well-versed in this stuff than I am, so his review goes into more depth behind the mathematical/physics claims that Tegmark makes. I found myself largely nodding along and agreeing with most of Aaronson\u2019s opinions there.You might think that I, as a mathematically-inclined person, might seize upon the idea presented here. Tegmark\u2019s MUH says not only that we can describe the universe using mathematics (a notion almost axiomatic to our physics) but that all of our physical reality itself is literally mathematical. That is, our entire subjective human experiences are simply the consequence of certain facets of a certain mathematical structure within a superset of structures, the entirety of which comprise the Level IV multiverse, i.e., the sum total of all existence and anything that could ever possibly exist.It\u2019s tempting. And yet\u2026.Years ago I read \nThe Grand Design\n. This was back in my university days, mind, when I was high on philosophy classes of all kinds and armed much more to purpose for these kinds of throw-downs. Nowadays, my memory of the differences between ontological and epistemological arguments requiring jogging from Wikipedia, I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019m up to the task. Yet one idea has stayed with me from Hawking and Mlodinow\u2019s book: that of model-dependent realism. They proposed that the reason we are having so much trouble finding a \u201ctheory of everything\u201d to unify the physics of the big (relativity) and the physics of the small (QM) is because no such theory exists. Rather, different theories are required depending on the situation one is trying to model. It is an intriguing idea, one I hadn\u2019t really encountered in a science book before. And I really liked how it short-circuited many anti-realist objections to scientific realism.Tegmark appears to move in the opposite direction. He backs the ToE horse (which is fine) by insisting that the ToE is reality. And then he kind of dodges the question of whether that means we will ever actually find a ToE (because if we did, wouldn\u2019t that mean we just have \u2026 reality?).That\u2019s what I mean about the MUH being uninteresting and unintelligible. He starts off by talking about how the movement of time is an illusion, all very much standard stuff depending on how you define spacetime, etc. Yawn. When we get into the more \u201ccontroversial\u201d material, his argument just sort of breaks down. He starts making a whole bunch of probabilistic paradox arguments, like quantum suicide, the doomsday argument, etc.\u2014the kind of thought experiments that are fun to put into a first-year philosophy textbook but that have little connection to, you know, reality. These thought experiments rely explicitly on making assumptions to make up for our near-total lack of knowledge about a situation. The whole point is that, as we acquire more certain knowledge, we are in a better position to see if we are indeed a representative sample or if, perhaps however improbably, we are not.Tegmark\u2019s MUH is also, despite his claims to the contrary, completely untestable/unfalsifiable. He insists that we will uncover evidence and create theories which logically imply the MUH, and that\u2019s just silly. The MUH is untestable because we currently have no alternative to mathematics as a way of describing physical theories of reality. It is unfalsifiable, because even if we can get past the testing problem, how will we know if we\u2019ve discovered a physical law or property that violates the MUH? Almost by definition, the MUH can take nearly any observational evidence and somehow fit into its framework. Tegmark claims that if the MUH is false, then we will one day run up against an insurmountable \u201cwall\u201d in physics beyond which our knowledge of reality can progress no further, since our mathematics will no longer be able to express reality. I disagree. I think model-dependent realism would be an effective way to counteract such a wall: maybe to progress, all we need do is abandon the search for a ToE and instead create theories of everything.The last half of Our Mathematical Universe is a wild ride of philosophy of mathematics and science. I loved reading it. I found parts of it very convincing, but I don\u2019t think those parts (combined with the other parts) necessarily add up to the whole that Tegmark calls the Level IV multiverse, the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis. I think he is incredibly enthusiastic about this idea and has clearly spent a lot of time thinking on it\u2014which is great. I loved that I got a chance to read it. But I don\u2019t think his arguments are as sound as he thinks they are. I say this not from a physicist\u2019s position (because I\u2019m not one) nor even a mathematician/logician (because, let\u2019s face it, my memory of higher math dims with each passing day) but as the target demographic for this book, the hard-core popular science reader who is looking for a new hit to bring on that theoretical physics high. It\u2019s a nice try, Tegmark, and you almost had me going."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair", "userReview": "A Wild Ride With Mad MaxAlfred North Whitehead famously said that philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato. Welcome to yet another footnote, as the thesis of this book, in the author\u2019s words, \u201ccan be viewed as a form of radical Platonism, asserting that all the mathematical structures in Plato\u2019s \u2018realm of ideas\u2019 exist \u2018out there\u2019 in a physical sense.\u201d In other words, there is no physical reality, just pure mathematics.This book is a fun ride for those with a reasonable understanding of physics, as long as fun means to stimulate your thinking without taking it all too seriously. As for the rest of us, be warned that the author himself explicitly rates his own chapters as \u201cmainstream\u201d, \u201ccontroversial\u201d and \u201cextremely controversial\u201d. And some of the supposedly mainstream stuff should also be labeled controversial. Objective Reality Requires Objective MathematicsLet us start at the beginning, with the assumption makes it possible to do science: \u201cThere exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans.\u201d But then Tegmark follows this up with a consequence I had not really thought of:\u201cIf we assume that reality exists independently of us humans, then for a description to be complete, it must also be well defined according to nonhuman entities \u2013 aliens or supercomputers, say \u2013 that lack any understanding of human concepts. Such a description must be expressible in a form that is devoid of any human baggage like \u2018particle\u2019, \u2018observation\u2019 or other human words.\u201dMathematics is the only language we have that meets these requirements. The question of whether or not our mathematics is truly free of human baggage is not really addressed, but let us assume this kind of mathematics does exist somewhere. Thus the goal science should be to eliminate such subjective human baggage. So far, so good.The Illusion of EquivalenceWe learn that our current descriptions of reality at the most basic level are becoming ever more abstract and mathematical. Yes, but now the fun begins. We are told that the Equivalence Principle means that two descriptions are equivalent if there is a correspondence between them that preserves all relations. Therefore, if external reality can be described by mathematics, it must actually be a mathematical structure. And if the reality we know is nothing but mathematics, then all imaginable forms of mathematics are equally valid descriptions of other realities.Here we have the arbitrary assumption that because there can be equivalent descriptions of reality, it follows that those descriptions are equivalent to reality itself. Next, we get that most basic logical fallacy that if one mathematical structure describes reality, then all such structures must define a reality. This logic leads us from a single objective reality to the conclusion that all possible realities are true, which means that reality is arbitrary and therefore subjective.Slippery SubjectivityThe same kind of word game is used inject the concept of subjectivity into Hugh Everett\u2019s theory of the quantum multiverse. Ironically, that theory was constructed to avoid the subjectivity of the standard Copenhagen Interpretation. The logic goes like this: When you flip a quantum coin, the result is heads in one universe, and tails in another. He then claims, \u201cAt the end of this experiment (any choice) there will be two different versions of you, each subjectively feeling just as real as the other, but completely unaware of each other\u2019s existence.\u201dThis is an abuse of the term \u201csubjective\u201d. Each version of you (assuming they exist) has every right to objectively feel real, as there is no possible interaction with the other supposed universe. He actually makes the absurd statement that, \u201cEverett\u2019s work has shown that understanding the process of observation requires us to include a third part of our Universe as well: your mental state as an observer.\u201d Don\u2019t take my word that this is wrong. Later in the book, when he is back to being a physicist again, he says,\u201cDo you need a human observer to collapse the wavefunction? Now I am convinced that consciousness has nothing to do with it, since even a single particle could do the trick. I realized that quantum observation is not about consciousness, but simply about the transfer of information.\u201dTurning Entropy into Subjective MushNow we move from bad philosophy to outright error involving the well-established scientific concept of Entropy. While I am a bit weak on its mathematical foundation, all I need to know is that it has a mathematical foundation to know the following is rubbish:\u201cEntropy is a quantitative measure of our lack of information about a system\u2026. If the object interacts with you, then you get more information about it, and its entropy decreases. If the object interacts with the environment, you lose information about it, so its entropy increases\u2026 The traditional formulation of the law simply corresponds to ignoring the subject.\u201dThe subject is ignored for the good reason that entropy is about the information content of the system, not the observer. Let me try this simple analogy: If you do not tidy your desk, it tends to get messy, meaning more disordered, thus having more entropy. Even if you think you know where everything is, the desk is still just as disordered. Your knowledge describes the entropy of your mind, not the desk. If you neatly stack the papers the desk is now more ordered, with less entropy, even if you no longer know where anything is anymore.How can a prominent physicist take a standard concept like entropy and turn it into subjective mush? The Nature of RealityWhile we are talking about philosophy, let us address the question of how we can know anything, as Plato tried to do so long ago. There is a brilliant treatment of this in The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. I have a simpler explanation. We are not philosophers living in Plato\u2019s cave; we have to survive in the real world. If our subjective model does not match external reality, we become someone\u2019s lunch.But Max\u2019s solution for the connection between our internal subjective perception and external reality is to insert a layer between them called \u201cconsensus reality\u201d. This is a rather surprising move for someone who prides himself in defying consensus and decries its herd mentality, but we have to expect surprises. Here is how he puts it: \u201cThe challenge for physics is deriving the consensus reality form the external reality, and the challenge for cognitive science is to derive the internal reality from the consensus reality.\u201dWhile in practical terms consensus reality is important (but certainly not infallible), it is by no means fundamental.The Inflationary MultiverseMuch of the book is taken up with the idea of a multiverse. But one is not enough; Mad Max\u2019s innovation is to posit four layers of different kinds of multiverses.It begins with the chapter about cosmic inflation, which should really have the \u201ccontroversial\u201d rather than the \u201cmainstream\u201d classification. The idea is that our observable universe is only part of an infinite space created by the inflationary force. Somehow, General Relativity creates an infinite space inside a finite space smaller than an atom. Because that space is infinitely big, it apparently follows that anything that can happen does happen somewhere, so there must be infinitely many other worlds exactly like this one. That is the Level I multiverse.Not sure about all that? No problem, just skip to later on in the book:\u201c[Inflation] predicted infinitely many observers measuring different things with probabilities depending on a measure that we don\u2019t know. Which, in turn means that inflation, strictly speaking, is not predicting anything at all about what typical observers should see. All predictions are revoked, including those whose predictions that made us take inflation seriously in the first place! Self-destruction is complete.\u201dIn other words it amounts to a bait and switch operation. The original inflation theory supposedly explained several features of the early universe, but with more development it got turned into \u201ceternal inflation\u201d and now anything is possible. Therefore, as he says, all predictions are revoked.I also had my suspicion about the use of infinity. So does Max:\u201cThere is a fundamentally flawed assumption at the very foundation of modern physics. Here is my prime suspect: infinity. In fact, I have two suspects: \u2018infinitely big\u2019 and \u2018infinitely small\u2019. By infinitely big, I mean the idea that space can have infinite volume, that time can continue forever, and that there can be infinitely many physical objects. By infinitely small, I mean the continuum: the idea that even a liter of space contains an infinite number of points, that space can be stretched out indefinitely without anything bad happening, and that there are quantities in nature that can vary continuously. The two are closely related: inflation created an infinite volume by stretching continuous space indefinitely.\u201dAll this blows away two of the four levels of multiverse. The third one is the quantum multiverse. Remember the principle of equivalence? It actually applies here. There is only one mathematical expression of quantum field theory therefore all interpretations are equivalent. So the quantum multiverse is a legitimate but unverifiable interpretation. The final level is the mathematical universe, in which anything we can imagine is equally true. I will leave the evaluation of this idea to the reader.The Trouble with PhysicsIn The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next Lee Smolin points out that scientific theories tend to take on a life of their own, even if there is little evidence to support them. Max Tegmark elevates this \u201cbug\u201d into the ultimate \u201cfeature\u201d of his hypothesis: any and every valid mathematical structure defines a physical universe. By this logic, all 10^500 variants of string theory are by definition true. In the old days, a theory that predicted anything and everything was seen to predict nothing. Now, that is taken as more evidence for a multiverse.The thing is, I really enjoyed reading this book. A lot of the information is well presented, and there are plenty of ideas with which to stimulate the imagination. There are some curiosities. For example, Tegmark is an expert on decoherence of the quantum wavefunction, and debunks the possibility of quantum processes in the brain. But the deeply related concept of entanglement is never mentioned.Perhaps the saving grace is that most of the many questionable ideas get contradicted somewhere else. Controversy takes precedence over consistency. Perhaps we should think of all these contradictions as a superposition of states, which are true in different universes. Just not this one. How can I rate such a book? For those with some knowledge of the subject, I give it five stars for its entertainment value. But I suggest those with less knowledge stay away \u2013 there is too much misleading material."}, {"userName": "Sally Ember", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15085128-sally-ember", "userReview": "Bet he wishes he had waited about 6 months to publish it, to rewrite the sections related to microwaves, inflationary multiverse and mathematical proofs of that and more info about dark matter/dark energy!Fantastically interesting, inspiring, and almost comprehensible to this non-physicist, non-advanced-mathematician!

I loved every page. Without question, this was one of my favorite books about the universe.Lately I have been interested in information theory. Reading multiple books on the same subject, there is always the danger of becoming bored. After reading other books on the subject, I read this book and Island of Knowledge by Gleiser at the same time. Both of these books were excellent. Both books had a good deal of overlap but were markedly different in important ways. Rather than being repetitive, they served more to reinforce important ideas. The time I spent getting familiar with these books (often reading chapters over and over again) was deeply, deeply enjoyable. Tegmark's sprinkling of biographical information along side his tutorials on basic and complex concepts in physics reminded me a lot of Feynman, if Feynman had been humble. Tegmark's gift for making the complex accessible to non-physicists reminded me of Carroll's gift in relating to all types of audiences. The subject matter in this book reminded me of Vedral's decoding reality, but it delved in a bit more at times and provided a richer over all experience, which felt more satisfying. Tegmark provides one of the simplest and most beautiful descriptions of how each thing (be it atom, star, person, etc) is merely a compilation of smaller things that can ultimately be thought about ( and indeed do exist) as tiny bits of information. For sure, this argument has been made many times before, but I enjoyed Tegmark's argument to a surprising degree. This was one of the most satisfying reading experiences I have had in a long time. When Tegmark related his Jekyll and Hyde story and then got into the meat of his argument, my brain was in a constant state of euphoria. Braingasm, braingasm, braingasm! I could feel the dopamine rush as he flooded my brain with idea after idea. While at university, I used to sit and talk with two of my best friends, and intellectual soulmates, about the ultimate nature of the universe. These times are some of my most treasured memories in life. Reading this book was like being back in those conversations."}, {"userName": "Juan Ruiz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28050512-juan-ruiz", "userReview": "It is interesting to see how certain philosophies or theories stay almost unchanged despite the many advances humans have made in science, knowledge and information. In my opinion, what Tegmark arrives to after his many years of studying mathematics and physics (and after the many humans who have contributed to that progress), is very similar to what Pythagoras had arrived to some 3000 years ago. As far as my understanding goes, the author argues that, first, there is an ultimate nature of reality (if I\u00b4m not mistaken this is called monism), and second, that this ultimate nature is mathematics. What I (and I expect many people who read this) will find controversial is that he doesn't say that the ultimate nature of reality is explained by mathematics, but that it is mathematics. My humble opinion is that Tegmark is jumping into conclusions, assuming that physical properties, excellently described by mathematics, are mathematics themselves. This is an interesting notion, but it was first set forth by other philosophers, most notable Plato, who argued that the true nature of our reality was very different from the one we perceived with our senses. Now, also Kant argued that the ultimate nature of things was very different from what we experienced, and that that \"thing in itself\" would never be known to us. If what Tegmark argues is true, then we would be tempted to conclude that mathematics would be that \"thing in itself\". This I find very interesting. It is strange for me that although he says that anything that can exist mathematically can also exist physically in what he calls the Level IV multiverse, he is suspicious about infinity, which as far as I understand, is a very accepted mathematical concept. He is skeptical about Godel's incompleteness theorems, and in this sense, he is disagreeing not only with Godel, but also with Cantor, both of which I believe were excellent mathematicians. He needs to disagree with these notions in order to make better sense of his theory. Moreover, the fact that his theory cannot be proven or falsified makes me feel uneasy. Chapter 12, which in my opinion is the most relevant chapter of this book, ends with this paragraph: \"Looking toward the future, there are two possibilities. If I'm wrong and the MUH is false, then physics will eventually hit an insurmountable roadblock beyond which no further progress is possible: there would be no further mathematical regularities left to discover even though we still lacked a complete description of our physical reality. For example, a convincing demonstration that there's such a thing as fundamental randomness in the laws of nature (as opposed to deterministic observer cloning that merely feels random subjectively would therefore refute the MUH. If I'm right, on the other hand, then there'll be no roadblock in our quest to understand reality, and we're really limited only by our imagination!\" I think he is being limited by his imagination in that very statement, for he can be right in some ways and wrong in some others. For example, why does he assume that if he is mistaken about the MUH there will be no further progress in physics? Why does he assume that the ultimate reality (assuming there is such a thing) will be understandable, and why understandable to humans, who just happened to appear very recently in this universe? The book is fun to read and is very well structured. He lets us know in advance the character of each section, some being mainstream science, some other sections controversial, and some others extremely controversial."}], "description": "Our Mathematical Universe is a journey to explore the mysteries uncovered by cosmology and to discover the nature of reality. Our Big Bang, our distant future, parallel worlds, the sub-atomic and intergalactic - none of them are what they seem. But there is a way to understand this immense strangeness - mathematics. Seeking an answer to the fundamental puzzle of why our universe seems so mathematical, Tegmark proposes a radical idea: that our physical world not only is described by mathematics, but that it is mathematics.
