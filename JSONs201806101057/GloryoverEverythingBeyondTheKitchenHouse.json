JUST ....OH MY GOSH.....***SOOOOOO GOOD***!!!!!!Anyone who read \"The Kitchen House\", and found it hard to put down....(pre-civil war, set on a Southern plantation ....black slaves...with catastrophe after catastrophe), ....will 'not' be disappointed - at all- with \"The Glory of Everything\". I think I liked it BETTER!!! The story takes off where \"The Kitchen House\" ends...but absolutely this is also a stand alone novel. There were less snowballing- tragedy after tragedy scenes ...allowing more time for deeper character development in this novel. Yet... I loved them both. Kathleen Grissom gives readers a 'golden- escape-reading-treat', with her talents.,Forgive me... but this novel was just so gripping, luminous, with heavenly gifted storytelling, I just didn't want to break up my enjoyment to take notes. However, it's a book to be experience anyway...( details would only be a drop in a bucket, as this book is to be experience).I can't recommend this book highly enough!!!!!!Sensitive themes....Regrets suffered...Outcasts...slavery, cruelties, emptiness, class, guilt, fear, choices made, dignity, loss, charmed life, illusions of a charmed life, jealousy, blacks, whites, masters, servants, morality, loyalty, lies and secrets, forgiveness, love. [note: all the important juicy themes which can add up to a 'favorite fiction' read...if written by the right person], which it was. Standout characters ....James - Pan- Robert- Henri- CarolineThank You, Simon & Schuster, Netgalley, and Kathleen Grissom"}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "I jumped at the chance to read an advance copy of this book because of how much I loved The Kitchen House. I was so anxious to get this book that I requested it from two sources just to increase my odds of getting it . I was fortunate enough to receive a digital copy from both and I thank NetGalley and Edelweiss as well as the publisher, Simon & Schuster and Kathleen Grissom. This is the story of James Burton, or Jamie Pyke as we knew him as a child in the first book. James was raised as white by a woman he believed to be his grandmother but is the son of a slave woman Belle , raped by her master. There are multiple narrators of this story beginning with James and in his sections we learn how he came to be James Burton. While a lot of the book is devoted to his story , this is also the story in the larger sense of the most shameful time in our history. It it through memorable characters who in my view are the real heroes that we get a sense of this horrific time : Henry , a runaway slave , a loving father and good man; Sukey , beautiful Sukey, also a character from the first book , whose story will break your heart and leave you wondering how with such a burden of sorrow she can move forward with strength and heart and do what she does for others ; Pan, Henry's son, a precocious boy always questioning but somehow knowing what is the right thing to do and the brave people along the Underground Railroad - these are the heroes. It's easy to love , dislike or even hate most of the characters in this book . That is not the case with James . I had mixed feelings throughout about James . Perhaps it's indicative of his complex history and the terrible reality of slavery of which he is a product and in many ways did not have choices early on in his life . It just took much too long for my liking for James to understand what the right thing was. I may have given it 5 stars if in the end James made the right choices before certain circumstances changed that made it easier for him to do so. This can be read as a stand alone but I recommend reading both ."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen", "userReview": "I have always had a soft spot when it comes to slavery stories. They scream with emotion, of inhumanity, of savagery. Yet, they can also embrace with compassion and love. And although I detest they happened, I'm always compelled to read them and think there is a sliver of truth in all. In this narrative, a missing negro boy sends Burton, a black man so fair skinned he has been living the life of a white man, on a search back to the southern states where his freedom is threatened from a past he left behind. But return he must, to try and track down the boy who has suspiciously disappeared and is suspected of being enslaved.The stories cross over. We meet several slaves and whites along this journey. We learn of Burton and how he denied his own ancestry in order to survive in the white Man's world and the truths that threaten to emerge. We learn of forgiveness and acceptance.The words fly off the page and I was transported back to 1830. Grissom has captured my heart with these characters who have escaped slavery, empowered themselves with education and cherish their freedom above everything. A truly moving 4.5 \u2605"}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "\"Where, then, did I belong? Was my birth an accident of fate, or was my life intended to have some purpose?\"Jamie Pyke, fair-skinned son of a slave named Belle and a cruel master named Marshall, ran from his Virginian plantation home, his heritage and his fate at the age of thirteen. James Burton, wealthy Philadelphia businessman and heir to the silversmith shop and fortune of his kindly adoptive parents, has spent his teen years and adulthood hiding his former identity. When James falls for a beautiful white woman of high social standing, his secret is threatened. The disappearance of his devoted servant, Pan, presents a moral dilemma to James. Pan\u2019s father, Henry, who once rescued James in his time of need, begs James to search for his son whom he believes has been abducted and sold into slavery in the south. But can James risk returning to a region where his identity could be revealed and his life placed at risk? Glory Over Everything, sequel to The Kitchen House, is a gripping and well-crafted novel that kept me turning the pages despite frequent vacation distractions. Multiple, alternating first person narratives are employed throughout the book. I liked this technique as it allowed me to learn a great deal more about the innermost thoughts of those characters that perhaps, due to their circumstances, would otherwise be less illuminated. James is a very conflicted individual and at times could be unlikable. Even with the knowledge that Belle\u2019s blood flowed through his veins, he could not reconcile himself to the fact that he was anything other than a white man. At the same time, it was not completely lost on him that those who were there for him in his times of greatest need were in fact black men and women of tremendous principles and trustworthy character. Men and women like Henry, Robert, Sukey, and the people of the Underground Railroad will capture your heart and give you faith in humanity despite the fact that men like the ruthless slave tracker Rankin and despicable slave owner Bill Thomas exist. The fearless and independent-minded Miss Adelaide quickly became a favorite new character! I would love to see more of her \u2013 I would be thrilled if Ms. Grissom decided to expand upon her in another installment. Pan is another for whom I felt a soft spot, not unlike that which James perhaps perceived in his heart as well. I would be interested to learn how the relationship continues to change between Pan and James. Pan, who looked up to James as a sort of heroic figure, sees James falter and therefore betray the image he once had of him. Can James make amends and come to terms with his own identity? I highly recommend this book to lovers of historical fiction and anyone that appreciates stories of human triumph. There is a great deal of tension and a bit of nail-biting as the plot reaches a climax. The characters, however, are what truly crown this novel, in my opinion. There are some coincidences that seemed slightly unlikely, and I found the ending to be a little rushed and perhaps a tad bit too tidy, causing me to deduct one star from my review. While this is a stand-alone novel, I recommend that you read The Kitchen House first, in order to gain a better perspective on the background of some of the characters. I look forward to reading whatever Kathleen Grissom has in store for us next! \"We all carry burdens from our past, but it is not for others to exploit them.\""}, {"userName": "Jaline", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline", "userReview": "\u201dI looked at my hands to see if I was the same person now I was free. There was such a glory over everything. The sun came up like gold through the trees, and I felt like I was in heaven.\u201d \u2013 Harriet TubmanThis beautiful quote introduces the sequel to The Kitchen House. Glory Over Everything is an apt title as this book is ultimately about freedom from slavery and freedom from its stigma. It is narrated with smoothly rotating chapters between James, Caroline, Pan, and Sukey.James\u2019 mother is a mulatto and his father was white. When he fled the south for Philadelphia he was only 13 years old and scared. Henry, an escaped slave, saved his life and set him on his way to live a white man\u2019s life where his fortunes took a very positive turn. He meets Caroline, the daughter of influential Philadelphians, and falls deeply in love. However, their romance is doomed. She is already married, and he has secrets to hide.Pan, Henry\u2019s 12 year old son, is abducted by slave traffickers and put on a ship destined for the Deep South. Henry pleads for James\u2019 help in recovering him and James goes, partly to recover from a bad situation and partly because he knows that he owes Henry a huge debt for saving his life when he was young.From here, the story becomes darker and so filled with frightening and horrific events that I could hardly read fast enough. My heart was literally pounding in places, and felt like it was breaking to pieces in other places. There are times when all hope of escaping their predicaments seemed impossible, and there are times when the unlikeliest of souls turned out to be angels of assistance in disguise.These two books, The Kitchen House and Glory Over Everything, are truly important books. They tell stories that are both familiar and new; stories that are heartbreaking and uplifting. They tell stories of taking strides toward freedom and the cost for some as well as the triumph for others.\u201dI looked at my hands to see if I was the same person now I was free. There was such a glory over everything.

Dare I say I this is a case where the sequel is better than the original?Told through the perspectives of several narrators, Grissom tells the story of a family woven together (and torn apart) by the horrors of slavery in 1830's America. As in Grissom's earlier work, it's a plot-driven novel with many compelling and interconnected story lines. Though the book borders on melodrama, it is engaging, and I personally found it to be more moving than The Underground Railroad. \"Glory\"'s characters are memorable -- even the loathsome ones. The female leads are particular firecrackers. While providing a tidy enough ending for this book, Grissom has also left the door wide open for a third installment in the series. This fan is hoping the books keep on coming.Thank you to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for a galley of the book in exchange for an honest review.

I started reading it on my trip to CA, but couldn't get into it. Started it again once I was back and I couldn't put it down. Glory picks up after The Kitchen House and follows Jamie Pyke as he navigates life after escaping Rankin, Master Marshall, and the plantation he lived on. Jamie lives as a white man, painting for a living, and enjoying the perks of a socialite in Philadelphia. It all changes when his secret parentage is revealed and the race begins. I loved this one so much more than The Kitchen House-- how is that even possible? The story was elaborate and detailed. I enjoyed meeting all of the new characters and found myself rooting for them to overcome their obstacles. The final third, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out how Grissom would end this one. Would they make it? Who would survive this haunting tale of slavery and freedom? How would it end?

I think I liked this more than the original, even though I've given them both 4 stars. There are some wonderful characters that we get to know, and James, although very well formed and sympathetic, was probably my least favorite, when compared to the truly great (and not as well formed) Robert, Pan, Addy, and Sukie. I greatly appreciated the ease in following the chapters (each told us what year it was and whose point of view was up). Gradually I was completely absorbed and taken by the story, which had some sad moments and heartbreak, some close calls, death as well as new life, and with the Underground Railroad perhaps some hope for the future.I think the author could very well continue the story even more, but it sounds like that's not in the cards, which is sadly our loss."}, {"userName": "Shelagh Rice", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20709970-shelagh-rice", "userReview": "This is a wonderful book. I really enjoyed the The Kitchen House and I loved this one. You can read it as a standalone but I found it richer having read The Kitchen House first. A black man, son of the Master raised as white by his grandmother. It's 1830 and he is living as a white man constantly looking over his shoulder fearing discovery. When a long time debt that needs to be repayed brings him back to the south it becomes fraught with danger, secrets and difficult memories. This book is engaging from the start, historically accurate, often brutal, emotionally charged, a page turner of the highest order and superbly inspirational.

He is now James Burke, passing for a white man and ends up doing quite well for himself, though he continues to hide the secret of his parentage. This makes him somewhat of a cold fish in my opinion, and so I had trouble \"liking\" him. Yet, Grissom makes him a believable character, like him or not. A man with a constant struggle of who he really is and a conflict of what is right and wrong. I felt he did not really know who he was until he chances a return to his childhood South in search of young Pan. There he is forced to make hard decisions, let go of his secrets and fears and come to terms with who he was, or rather who he was going to let himself be. I was a bit miffed that it seemed to take him so long and several poor decisions to do so. As much as I did not care for James, I loved so many of the secondary characters. Pan was a delight to meet, full of the adoration and wonder of youth, until he sees first hand how cruel life could be. Yet he always seemed to see some joy. I especially attached myself to the stoic Henry, the loyal and wise Robert as well as the feisty and ahead of her time Adelaide. For me these characters were much more comfortable in their skin than James/Jamie. They were who they were and their richness came to life for me. Grissom fulfilled my hopes of life after The Kitchen House. The next chapter of a horrible part of history and how the struggles of slavery continued. Her writing is beautiful and takes me to the scenes she sets. I can see a continuation of this story with some of the younger characters but as this left me with a sense of hope I am not sure I need more."}, {"userName": "Dorie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie", "userReview": "Even though this book is not due out until next April I just had to read it as soon as I was approved. I was granted an ARC of this novel from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I am a huge fan of Kathleen Grissom. I loved The Kitchen House and purchased it for several members of my family. I was absolutely thrilled that she wrote this follow up.I was not disappointed. The story picks up many years after the The Kitchen House and we follow the life of Jaime Pyke who has moved to Philadelphia. He has been passing as \u201cwhite\u201d and is a well established silver smith who eventually owns his own shop and home. He was fortunate enough to have a silversmith who took him in and trained him in the art. I was glad that the author provided back story to Jaime\u2019s life as it has been quite some time since I read The Kitchen House. When he is approached by Henry, a free black who helped him rise and become successful, to help him find and return his son Pan, he shows his integrity and gratitude by agreeing to search for Pan. The story does go back and forth in time and is told in different points of view, and since I wasn\u2019t able to finish it in one or two sittings, I did find myself having to go back and read pages again but that was just my situation at the time.It was almost painful for me to revisit the plantation with the characters of Master Marshall and the horrid Rankin who terribly mistreated the slaves even to the point of whipping some to death. But we also are reminded of Miss Lavinia who was so kind and even taught Jaime to read and write. The atmosphere and settings are very well described as are all of the characters.The later flight to freedom was the most intense part of the book for me. The book kept reminding of the issues still concerning racism in our country.You do not have to have read The Kitchen House to enjoy this book. The author provides a lot of background to all of the characters. But I do encourage you to read the first book, it is a wonderful work of historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Ann Marie (Lit\u00b7Wit\u00b7Wine\u00b7Dine)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7447086-ann-marie-lit-wit-wine-dine", "userReview": "\u201cI looked at my hands to see if I was the same person now I was free.

Though Glory Over Everything: Beyond the Kitchen House is a stand-alone novel, I highly recommend reading The Kitchen House if you haven\u2019t already.James Burton (formerly Jamie Pyke) is passing as a wealthy white Philadelphia silversmith who has denied his true identity for many years after fleeing Tall Oaks, the Virginia planation where he was raised. He has fallen in love with Caroline, a white woman from a wealthy family.

James embarks on a dangerous journey to save Pan, the son a friend to whom he owed his very life.I really liked this book but I\u2019m not sure I loved quite as much as The Kitchen House. It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exactly why. I loved Pan\u2019s character and wanted to jump into the story to protect him myself. In fact, all of the characters were crafted with the same depth and complexity as those I grew to love in The Kitchen House. Perhaps I simply had a difficult time reconciling certain aspects of James\u2019s character. For example, while I could understand his reasons for wanting to maintain his identity as a white man, I took offense at his disdain toward slaves. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about that. There are other examples but I don\u2019t want to include any spoilers. On the other hand, there are characters I absolutely adored. For example, the young but formidable Adelaide Spencer. She is the teen daughter of the man who owns the property adjacent to where Pan is being held. She\u2019s a young woman of conviction; someone I would like to believe I would have been like had I lived in those times.Kathleen Grissom has told us another beautiful story. Even when the story is full of unimaginable pain and hardship, she has a unique way of weaving in enough snippets of the good in humanity, and the awesome strength of good people working together, to prevent us from losing all hope.4.25/5 starsThanks to Simon & Schuster via NetGalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Please visit my blog to read more of my reviews."}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "Grissom\u2019s debut - The Kitchen House - became a runaway hit via word-of-mouth and book club recommendations. This book follows one of the characters in the first book over several decades.There is a good story idea here \u2013 Jamie / James is a \u201crunaway\u201d slave who is so light-skinned as to be able to pass for white, and he makes a success of himself in Philadelphia. When the young Negro boy he has taken into his household disappears, the boy\u2019s father pleads with James to go to the south and retrieve the boy. James hires people to search for the boy, but is distracted by his own troubles \u2013 an indiscretion threatens to reveal his secret and destroy the life he has built. There are a number of twists and turn in the plot and Grissom keeps the action moving forward. There are scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. I was caught up in the story and wanted to know how things would turn out, and how the characters would fare. However \u2026Grissom uses multiple narrators. This is not an easy technique to employ successfully. Grissom has said in numerous interviews that her characters \u201cspoke\u201d to her, and revealed the story in their own way. But the result is that there is less cohesion in the story-telling. The ending felt rushed to me. There was so much danger and uncertainty even 30 pages from the ending, and while there is some ambiguity (not a bad thing given the story arc) about what will happen in the future, it seemed to me that Grissom was trying too hard to wrap things up with a pretty bow. In summary, it\u2019s a good story and kept me turning pages, but the writing fell short.

It was a beautifully written emotional and gritty story about slavery. It's also a book that I frequently suggest to friends, family and customers at the library where I work who want a riveting historical fiction read.Well, Grissom has done it again. In Glory Over Everything, the sequel to The Kitchen House, Grissom brings back some of her beloved characters and weaves a new story that was even more riveting and hard to put down than the first book. I actually stayed up well after 1am to finish it.Yes, I loved, loved, LOVED this book. Glory Over Everything is a page-turner and has Grissom's captivating writing style and characters who seem to come to life before you. It follows the life of Jamie Pyke as he makes a new life in Philadelphia while trying to hide a secret that could destroy all that he has built. When someone to whom he owes a large debt comes for his help Jamie realizes he must return to the south and face a very uncertain future with potentially dire consequences. The story is told once again via multiple narrators and is a fast-paced read that not only focuses on race, slavery and the Underground Railroad but also on family ties and how one\u2019s upbringing continues to influence us.While this is considered a sequel to The Kitchen House, and includes several characters from that book, it can also be read as a standalone. But I think you'd be missing out if you didn't read The Kitchen House first. Reading the first book will give the reader a more in depth understanding of Jamie and some of the other characters' histories, the reasons for their actions and their deeply rooted fears. But for those of you who want to jump right into this book, Grissom explains enough of the background of these characters for the new-to-Grissom reader to grasp the older story lines.The only issue that I had with this book is that there were some rather unlikely (and too convenient) ways some characters met up in the book. Out of all the plantations in all the state Pan just happened to meet up with someone Jamie knew? Not quite believable but I loved seeing some of the characters from The Kitchen House so much that I didn't dwell on it. Some reviews of The Kitchen House complained about the brutal descriptions of the abuse of slaves. (It was a brutal time and I personally like that Grissom didn't sugar-coat anything.) While Glory Over Everything still deals with slavery I didn't find it to have such vivid descriptions of what life was like as a slave compared to the first book. There are still some gritty scenes but Grissom focuses quite a bit on the intense fear of being thrown back into slavery that many free slaves struggled with on a daily basis.The secondary characters all play pivotal roles in the plot and are each quite engaging with Jamie's butler, Robert, being my favourite. Jamie himself was an okay character. You witness his struggles and fears but I wasn't fond of his self-loathing and doubt.With complex characters, a gripping and often intense plot and emotional scenes Glory Over Everything is one of my favourite books of 2016 so far. It is filled with scenes of human endurance, strength, love, violence, betrayal, family loyalty, courage and the power of hope. That's a whole lot of emotion wrapped up into one book but Grissom is a master at writing gripping novels featuring characters that stay with her readers long after the last page is turned.Highly recommended.My Rating: 5/5 starsDisclaimer: My sincere thanks to Simon and Schuster Canada for providing me with a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.** This review, as well as hundreds more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) where I also share my favourite tried and true recipes. **"}, {"userName": "TamElaine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7555624-tamelaine", "userReview": "Huge love and gratitude to Netgalley, Kathleen Grissom, Simon & Shuster, for providing me with this incredible book that consumed my life for a couple of days and will continue to occupy a piece of my heart and mind for a long time to come....The Glory over Everything gets 5 bursting-at-the-seams stars from me, for the beautiful characters who stole my heart, for the fast pace, for the comfortable flow of the written words and dialect, for the intensity of the plot, the personal growth of the characters, the hint of a changing society, and the emotion it pulled from me (and let me tell you, there are two separate lines within the final couple of chapters that took me by surprise and made me gasp, cry outright and then sob !) My only criticism (and please take this as a huge compliment too!) is that I wanted more of Pan ! Ms. Grissom, I hope to see plenty more from you.

I, for one, would be among the first in line to pick up subsequent books."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Slavery, such an abhorrent institution, the thought that one person can own another and that they feel they have that right is horrifying. While reading this I couldn't help but ask myself if I had been raised during this time what would I have thought. Would I have had the courage to defy convention, become part of the underground railroad? I certainly hope so. There is much cruelty within these pages, but much kindness too, from the least expected places at times.But it is the characters that made this story for me. Jamie, raised as white only learning of his black heritage as a teen, when he has to, run away. Just loved young Pip and his father Henry, whose fear of slavery made him ever watchful, fearful. Robert, a black man, a man I would wish on my side no matter the circumstance and Adelaide, a young Southern girl, who is a handful, opinionated and wonderful. There is much on race of course, the differing opinions, degrees of acceptance, even in the North where slavery was not supposed to be accepted. But laws can be enacted, doesn't mean everyone will change their thinking. A book that at times left me breathless, angry, a book filled with emotion. The ending felt a bit too good to be true, a little much but I still immensely enjoyed this book. The world as a whole still has such a long way to go despite the fact that we have come a long way from the days of slavery. Or have we? Something to think about.ARC from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "April (Getting Hygge With It)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9204949-april-getting-hygge-with-it", "userReview": "Oh gosh. I'm so glad I got to continue on with some of the characters from The Kitchen House. Again, SO MUCH happened in this short book. How can she pack so much in without it seeming overkill?

After The Kitchen House, I knew that I would love (love-love-love) anything she produced. I\u2019m glad she decided to write a story that picks up where the Kitchen House left off. Still, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this is not a sequel \u2013 it\u2019s more of a parallel story, a little further in time - and I loved every page of it. Kathleen Grissom keeps on amazing me with her gift of simple but splendid story-telling. It\u2019s difficult to explain, but the time you spend with her words, you are literally transported into the story with so much pull, that when the book\u2019s finished, you are simply left bereft.The story of Jamie Pike, son of Tall Oaks plantation owner Marshall and Belle, a slave, is quite extraordinary. After escaping the South, Jamie\u2019s white countenance makes it so he can start a new life in Philadelphia without too much suspicion, and for awhile, he has a very settled life there. He is a true gentleman, and behaves totally in sync with his white upbringing and the moral code of the time. When his beloved young servant Pan has been stolen and sold as a slave, Jamie can\u2019t ignore his debt to Henry, Pan\u2019s father, and travels south in order to rescue young Pan from his ordeal. It is that journey, filled with danger, but also with the unexpected assistance from various courageous people, that, in time, brings Jamie to recognize who he really is and where he came from.Again, I applaud the author for being able to render the imagery of that particular time so vividly. The living conditions of African Americans in the south in the 1830-ies are so well told, that it leaves you thinking and reflecting. I have to say, I like it when books do that. The audiobook is fantastically narrated by: Santino Fontana, Heather Alicia Simms, Madeleine Maby, Kyle Beltran. You guessed it, this is a highly recommendable read."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1887310-irene", "userReview": "Mix race ancestry, free black children and the constant threat of slave catchers kidnapping people off the streets of Philadelphia, this story pursues the urgent need to reclaim a black boy kidnapped and sold into southern slavery even at the risk of becoming a victim oneself. This was just a bit too predictable. The voices of the various narrators never sounded authentic, but rather as amateur approximations of parody.

In Kitchen House, we followed the cruelty of slave owners and their overseers through the eyes of the young Irish indentured servant, Lavinia. Several characters introduced in the first book are mentioned in \u201cGlory\u201d but the main focus lies with young Jaime Pyke, a boy raised in the big house at Tall Oaks, assuming he was white until his heritage was revealed and he escaped the plantation before being sold into slavery. In Glory Over Everything we watch James grow up and find a home with a silversmith\u2019s family, the Burtons in Philadelphia. Throughout his time mixing with the upper class he continues to hide his identity. Pan, a small boy James agrees to take on as a house servant is kidnapped by unscrupulous slavers down at the town docks. His father begs James (now a Burton) to help him find his son. I found this second novel was slow to start and I struggled to stay interested in the upper-class life in which James finds himself. The story drifted very close to melodrama as James navigated the murky waters of the wealthy and attempted to keep secrets from prospective wives and their families. I wasn\u2019t that interested in the chapters told from Pan\u2019s point of view as they just repeated much of what James chapters revealed. The three dimensional characters and resulting emotional attachments seen in The Kitchen House are lacking in this novel. The book does improve when James finally sets off to search for Pan and we are once again introduced to Sukey. Her voice and her story save the novel from being a drawing-room bore.There were parts of the story I enjoyed. I was impressed once again with the research Ms. Grissom puts into her novels. From the simplicity of fine ladies vinaigrettes to descriptions of The Great Dismal Swamp the reader is transported back in time. Once again she builds tension and suspense surrounding the cruel treatment of slaves on southern plantations. It is hard to read and important to remember. So too is it important to learn about the kindness extended by Quakers and other sympathizers along the underground railway.I found this novel to be a poor cousin to The Kitchen House but I am glad I was given the chance to once again visit some of the characters I grew to love in the first novel.

A novel of family and long-buried secrets along the treacherous Underground Railroad.The author of the New York Times bestseller and beloved book club favorite The Kitchen House continues the story of Jamie Pyke, son of both a slave and master of Tall Oakes, whose deadly secret compels him to take a treacherous journey through the Underground Railroad.Published in 2010, The Kitchen House became a grassroots bestseller. Fans connected so deeply to the book\u2019s characters that the author, Kathleen Grissom, found herself being asked over and over \u201cwhat happens next?\u201d The wait is finally over.This new, stand-alone novel opens in 1830, and Jamie, who fled from the Virginian plantation he once called home, is passing in Philadelphia society as a wealthy white silversmith. After many years of striving, Jamie has achieved acclaim and security, only to discover that his aristocratic lover Caroline is pregnant. Before he can reveal his real identity to her, he learns that his beloved servant Pan has been captured and sold into slavery in the South. Pan\u2019s father, to whom Jamie owes a great debt, pleads for Jamie\u2019s help, and Jamie agrees, knowing the journey will take him perilously close to Tall Oakes and the ruthless slave hunter who is still searching for him. Meanwhile, Caroline\u2019s father learns and exposes Jamie\u2019s secret, and Jamie loses his home, his business, and finally Caroline.Heartbroken and with nothing to lose, Jamie embarks on a trip to a North Carolina plantation where Pan is being held with a former Tall Oakes slave named Sukey, who is intent on getting Pan to the Underground Railroad. Soon the three of them are running through the Great Dismal Swamp, the notoriously deadly hiding place for escaped slaves. Though they have help from those in the Underground Railroad, not all of them will make it out alive.It is a sad story in our American history. I found the book a satisfying conclusion to The Kitchen House, story lines are neatly wrapped. I give this 4 out of 5 stars just because the ending was predictable."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7555122-laura", "userReview": "Enjoyable read.

The story revolves around blacks, those passing as whites, and slavery both in Philadelphia and North Carolina, mid 1800s. With each meticulously written word, heartbreaking tragedy and enduring courage pulsate through the plot. Compulsive and propulsive until the last page, Glory Over Everything rewards the reader with period detail, edge-of-your-seat danger, and profoundly human characters.Jamie Pyke, passing as James Burton, was a minor figure in The Kitchen House. He is now a white aristocrat artist living in the upper echelon in early nineteenth century Philadelphia. He constantly attends to societal details, even fresh manicures, as he graces ballrooms and is attended to by house servants. Despite his sophistication, he fears his security in the white elite is tenuous. Multiple first person narratives inform us of James\u2019 back-story and lives of minor characters, some who were introduced in The Kitchen House. Jamie totters on danger if his true identity is discovered. After incriminating evidence is revealed, life as he knows it ceases. He chooses a virtuous path, returning to the south to rescue Pan, the son of his old friend, Henry. Tension builds in this historical thriller. We expect the brutality of the slaves to take center stage, but kindness trumps evil in the story. The bravery, sacrifice, and courage of the slaves are impressively aligned with the compassion and humanity of those who help them. The fine line walked by mulatto people living during the time of slavery is brilliantly painted. What happens to Pan in the future is an open door for Ms. Grissom to walk through in what may become her next novel. We shall see. Highly recommended.I thank the author and Simon and Schuster for an advance reader's edition for my unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Valery", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32120882-valery", "userReview": "The book can stand alone but I always love hearing bits of a previously read book fall into a new book I'm reading! I listened to the audio book (both books) and the narrators changed so I was a little thrown off when Lavinia's voice was so different (the original voice was HER) but she's only a very small part of the 2nd book. James was a little flat but I guess this was just his formal and self-protective nature. He was a little slow to come to the proper moral conclusions on more than one occasion because his first impulse was always to protect his secret. Pan was a completely lovable ray of sunshine who was impossible to ignore and who, along with Robert, eventually led James to take the best road forward to our happy ending."}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie", "userReview": "This terrific stand alone sequel to The Kitchen House picks up Jamie Pyke, now James Burton as he makes a life for himself in Philadelphia.
