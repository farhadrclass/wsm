The death was initially brushed aside as suicide, but thanks to a newspaper reporter with a lively curiosity and nose for the truth, this finding was thrown out and the case became one of high importance to every Vancouverite.I enjoyed the author's skillful storytelling, and felt myself immersed in the city's \"opium-hazed, smog-choked, rain-soaked glory.\" The novel was full of city street names, references to restaurants and other markers familiar to those who live in Vancouver. Unfortunately, the pace of the story was too languid to keep me enthralled; nevertheless, I found the book quite enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Kathy Stevenson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17861579-kathy-stevenson", "userReview": "An excellent novel that looks at an unsolved Vancouver murder case from 1924, fleshing out characters and creating a vivid picture of the atmosphere in the city at that time. John MacLachlan Gray is a talented writer who uses words with such skill that I found myself stopping to reread and appreciate his choices more than a few times."}, {"userName": "Roz Woodcock", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22818246-roz-woodcock", "userReview": "Intriguing storyThe story was quite a mystery of intrigue and duplicity set in post WW1 Vancouver. War verterans, upper class white society, chinese servants, mistresses and a burgeoning drug trade. All spun together in a tale that is somewhat difficult to follow at times. The local colour and flavour of the time and spa e is wonderful most of times but i think it could have been kept in check and limited to perhaps just the chAracters. No need for long drawn out Victorian/Edwardian discriptions. Like i said a good story....but........"}, {"userName": "Daniel Kukwa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3885089-daniel-kukwa", "userReview": "A very unusual read; between its cast of dozens and its multiple plots and character arcs, there is a great deal to keep track of...to say nothing of the core mystery at the heart of the story. It's less of a straightforward novel, and more of a kaleidoscope of people in 1924 Vancouver. It's full of fascinating characters and delicious historical atmosphere, but the plot lines themselves seem to just peter out by the novel's conclusion. There is definitely a satisfying & engaging atmosphere while reading the book, but the end of the journey feels far too unresolved."}, {"userName": "Diana Sandberg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2438275-diana-sandberg", "userReview": "Excellent! I've lived in Vancouver all my adult life, and I was endlessly fascinated by the historical presentation of my city, shockingly ugly warts and all. I also liked the characters Gray created. I would have appreciated an afterword that discussed the factual basis for the story and which of the characters were historical. I note some other reviewers expressed dissatisfaction with the ending, but it worked for me, given that the whole thing is based on a historical *unsolved* mystery. Enjoyable reading."}], "description": "Vancouver is in an uproar over the death by gunshot of a Scottish nanny, Janet Stewart. An almost deliberately ham-handed police investigation has Constable Hook suspecting a cover-up. The powerful United Council of Scottish Societies is demanding an inquiry. The killing has become a political issue with an election not far away.The city is buzzing with rumours. Miss Stewart's fellow nannies have accused the Chinese houseboy of murder, capitalizing on a wave of anti-Chinese propaganda led by the Asian Exclusion League and enthusiastically supported by the sensational press--not to mention the Ku Klux Klan, which has taken up residence in upperclass Shaughnessy.The White Angel is a work of fiction inspired by the cold case of Janet Smith, who, on July 26, 1924, was found dead in her employer's posh Shaughnessy Heights mansion. A dubious investigation led to the even more dubious conclusion that Smith died by suicide. After a public outcry, the case was re-examined and it was decided that Smith was in fact murdered; but no one was ever convicted, though suspects abounded--from an infatuated Chinese houseboy to a drug-smuggling ring, devil-worshippers from the United States, or perhaps even the Prince of Wales. For Vancouver, the killing created a situation analogous to lifting a large flat rock to expose the creatures hiding underneath.An exploration of true crime through a literary lens, The White Angel draws an artful portrait of Vancouver in 1924 in all its opium-hazed, smog-choked, rain-soaked glory--accurate, insightful and darkly droll.", "title": "The White Angel", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36253611-the-white-angel", "average": 3.3, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508954423l/36253611.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/458693.John_MacLachlan_Gray", "name": "John MacLachlan Gray"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Mystery", "Historical", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36253611-the-white-angel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36376144-the-white-angel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1323533.The_Fiend_in_Human", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2981934-billy-bishop-goes-to-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/893264.White_Stone_Day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1323534.Not_Quite_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4143350-lost-in-north-america"]}
