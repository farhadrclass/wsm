So...here you go. :P\nShane stood up when he saw her, which made her heart turn cartwheels, and he pulled out her chair. Eve and Michael shared an amused look. \u201cSo cute,\u201d Eve said. When Shane glared, she smiled. \u201cNo, really. It is. Dude, chill.\u201d\n\n \u201cNight,\u201d she said, and watched him walk toward the door. \u201cHey. How\u2019d you get in?\u201d He wiggled his fingers at her in a spooky oogie-boogie pantomime. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire.

In the middle of the night?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMoms like me.\u201d\n\nIt sounded like tigers fighting, and as she backed up from the snarls and howls and sounds of bodies slamming around, the boards of the fence broke again, and a white hand\u2014not Myrnin\u2019s, this was a woman\u2019s\u2014clawed the air. Reaching for Claire. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d Myrnin called. He sounded eerily normal. \u201cDo go on and run, Claire. I\u2019ll catch up. This may take a few moments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why she bit me!\u201d Claire said. Myrnin blinked. \u201cBlood is the fuel that drives the engine, my dear. As with us all.

As with the other books, Caine does a great job in keeping the action going and twisting the events when you least expect it.In this book, Bishop\u2019s rule comes to an endgame and the people of Morganville, humans and vampires, make a move to take back their town. Claire faces her most challenging moments as she becomes the pawn between both Amelie and Bishop. Her loyal friends, Shane, Michael and Eve are never far out of reach and as with the other books, they ban together to keep each other safe from those trying to destroy Morganville and its inhabitant.I loved the Claire and Shane moments and all I have to say about page 121 is FINALLY! Well, I also have to say, very well done. Shane is absolutely awesome in this book and I\u2019m dying to know what was in the box that he gave Claire at the end. I have my suspicions, but they tend to be wrong as I\u2019ve made my fair share of assumptions in this book that didn\u2019t turn out. I did have a hard time suspending my reality and wrapping my fictional imagination around Ada. It was difficult for me to picture what she really looked like and her contribution to the storyline was just a little odd, but she served an important purpose of explaining the portals and the magical workings around the town of Morganville. So it was very clever on Caine\u2019s part to introduce her into the plot in this book.Myrnin was probably the best character in this book. I finally let my guard down and trust his motives and intentions, and he didn\u2019t disappoint. I was happy at how his conflict was resolved in the book. He does have some of the best snarky lines and reactions. Great character!Overall, great addition to this series and I can\u2019t wait to continue to read how this story shifts. I just hope Claire, Eve, Shane and Michael continue to be major characters in this series. Loved it!!"}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3603005-amber", "userReview": "Wooo Hooo! I will say hands down that this is the best one yet!! Way to go Ms. Caine!! This series is so different from all the other vampire books I have read. Sure they tap into the same well at one point or another, but the creative plots and the action packed, fast-paced story takes you into a whole other level. You can't but help falling in love with this series. (And Shane and Michael of course)I have to say that I have waited for page 120 & 121 patiently and I was totally giddy! Now, don't fast forward to that, you must wait your turn....The chemistry between the characters has evolved (wink, wink)and grown stronger.

The story seemed to resolve itself so quickly that I was left feeling like I missed something. I mean, I know the books are super short, but still. What I did like about this novel in particular was the stellar character dynamics and relationship progressions. I maintain that these characters feel a lot more rounded and realistic compared to many other YA.

Not even a cliffhanger in it, which is kind of a trademark for Rachel Caine.There's so many stuff happening, in all fronts. Some of them are typical Morganville stuff. There's a big bad villain, a feeling of disrepair, allies where you least expect them, enemies where you sure as hell expect them, a couple of nail biting moments, them parents that have no reason of being in this series whatsoever, and an epic battle where you have no idea who's on whose side.As for the gang? The gang is the same. Eve is still awesome, Michael still carries the weight of the world, Shane still loves Claire, and Claire? Claire just turned 17. She's stuck in that dreadful place where she's not yet a woman but she's definitely not a child. One moment she's confident and takes the lead and then she's a frightened girl who needs to be taken care of and to be told that everything's gonna be ok. And for the first time since this series kicked off, it kind of feels that things are going to be ok.And that's what's different.

Claire does some rather stupid things/ acts kinda stupid in the last half of the book. She's suppose to be really smart but she can't see what's going / happening around her even though I'm sure that pretty much anyone reading the book can and did figure out just about everything that is happening and is about to happen long before it does. The truth has to smack her upside the head before she finally gets it. Come on Claire!

I don't want to spoil, but there are big things happening in terms of death (I was very saddened by the death at the end), relationships (finally *wink*), and struggles for the freedom of Morganville. Vampires and humans band together to oust Bishop's evil reign, but not without immense cost and a lot of moments where you're holding your breath. I love how the author keeps us guessing; right down to the wire there are plot twists, questions about who's on which side, and outcomes different than what you'd expect. The characters remain one of the most enjoyable factors of the series; Caine portrays the Glass House-mates' banter and relationships extremely well. Her minor characters also shine, as I've mentioned in reviews past; Myrnin, Amelie, Hannah, and many others. And Claire is a good, strong heroine who falls into very few of the \"teenage female hero\" character traps; she thinks and acts for herself, stands up to both good and bad guys in awesome ways, retains a powerful sense of right and wrong as well as a core of empathy, and yet still shows realistic weaknesses, fears, and hesitancy. This particular conflict may have ended here, but I can't wait to see what else Caine has in store for Morganville in her next novels."}, {"userName": "Heather Dalgarno", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5868539-heather-dalgarno", "userReview": "Book 6 in the Morganville Vampires series, and I must admit I'm getting pretty bored.For a supposed genius the main character Claire Danvers can be pretty stupid at times. Painfully obvious plot twists appear to flummox this 'braniac' and I found this particularly frustrating. Unlike some of the other Morganville books I found myself in a rush to finish this one, so that I could move onto something a bit more fun.In this installment we see the showdown between the evil Mr Bishop and the native vampires of Morganville. Bishop makes for a pretty one dimensional character, whose motivations are not really fully explored or convincing. We also learn more about the murders that involved Eve's brother Jason, although this part of the plot sits awkwardly with the rest of the story, and seems a little 'flung in'. Fans of the series will probably enjoy this well enough, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it.

This is the first book in the series to not start straight after the last; it starts a few months after. This book changes everything in this series especially Claire and Shane\u2019s relationship.

The characters, the plot, the heartbreak, the action.. Morganville has become a second home for me.

Myrrnin continues to be one of my favorite characters, with his mysterious motives (which I started to trust), and the fate of Morganville at stake (hehe, stake!). I love seeing Claire mature more and more each book, and not be a whiney little child anymore. Shes really grown up in the 6 books that I've read so far, and in such a small amount of time.The heartbreak in this book was huge, especially with the death of one of my dearest, sweetest characters..

Shane and his father are in jail, scheduled for eventual execution. Michael's been turned against his will to Bishop's side. Bishop still rules, Myrnin is still crazy, and Amelie is in exile. Eve hates her and most of the town thinks she's a traitor. Bishop has also managed to cast a spell on Claire to make her do his bidding. Fun times all around.But wait, there's more (and worse). It's (relatively) easy to do Bishop's bidding when you literally don't have a choice. It's much harder when Bishop makes her choose between saving Shane's life and delivering what she assumes is a death warrant to one of her cop friends. She has to live with her choice for the rest of her life and acknowledge that she did Bishop's bidding through her own choice. I hope that continues to have psychological implications in later books.Eventually she learns that although Myrnin isn't exactly sane, he's maybe not as crazy as she thought, either. She also learns that the portals are controlled by a vampire computer that Myrnin created 300 years ago. (Because why use electricity when you can use blood?) The computer is inhabited by the consciousness of one of his former assistants he accidentally killed.As punishment for an attempt to break Shane out of jail, Bishop turns his father into a vampire, the thing he hates most. Later on Frank Collins attacks Claire, but is able to keep himself from doing any real damage. Instead he lets her go with the implication that he's going to kill himself. He shows up later in the book, though still in hiding, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out.And Shane and Claire take the next step in their relationship, which is good. I know it's a YA book, but I figure anyone mature enough to read the books is mature enough to deal with sex. And not having sex after all this would seem both unrealistic and preachy. So good for them and Rachel Caine.By the end of the book, Morganville has been restored, Bishop was defeated, and the vampires were all cured. There was, of course, a price, and I was sad to see Sam go but I figured Amelie was smart enough to hedge her bets. It's the dawn of a new era of vampire and human equality.This book also felt like it could have been the end of the series, but it didn't bother me nearly as much as Vicki Pettersson's City of Souls. One reason is that it was a clean resolution. There's really no major questions left, no challenges or enemies to overcome. There will be new books in the series, but I imagine it will be a whole different arc. City of Souls, on the other hand, doesn't really end cleanly. There's still at least some mopping up to do but it doesn't seem like the main character in that book is even necessary for the rest of the story, whereas Claire is always at the center of events.With Pettersson I know there's more to the story only because I know there are an additional two books in the series. With Caine I feel like this story has been told to completion and the next book will start a completely new story."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5724579-angie", "userReview": "10/17/15: Rereading!!!A lot has changed in Claire's life since the end of Lord of Misrule. For one, she's finally 17, and should be celebrating with her friends, but she's not. She also moved back in with her parents. She's now Bishop's errand girl, and is magically bound to do as he says, thanks to Myrnin's betrayal. I was so mad at him for that, but I also had this feeling that he had an ulterior motive and maybe even a plan. Maybe that's just denial caused by my love for him, or maybe not?Tensions are super high in Morganville in this book, which was a vast improvement over the ho-hum nature of the previous book. Bishop has everyone, vampire and human, under his thumb but they're not all willing to lay down and take it. Even little Claire starts talking back and standing up for herself this time around. I was very impressed with her. She is woman, hear her roar! Of course, she still manages to get herself into maor trouble by not listening to those who know better than her.There's a ton of plot progression in Carpe Corpus. Not only is there the climax to Bishops plot to overtake the town, but we get a lot more insight into that vampire disease: it's possible origin and cure! Myrnin also introduces us to a bizarre new character who plays a major role in the inner workings of Morganville. Seriously, she's a trip! Shane's dad is back, kind of. Claire and Shane's relationship! I'm so happy for them! Eve's psycho brother, and some new guy in town. Is he who he says he is? Plus plenty more!

Pot spune c\u0103 m\u0103 bucur c\u0103 am \u00eenceput aceast\u0103 serie \u0219i sper c\u0103 \u0219i continuarea s\u0103 fie la fel de pl\u0103cut de citit. Recomand seria celor care vor c\u00e2teva ore de relaxare, rom\u00e2ne u\u0219urele \u0219i care fac timpul s\u0103 zboare."}, {"userName": "Sophie *Ninja Rapunzel*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2351946-sophie-ninja-rapunzel", "userReview": "another awesome book by Rachel Caine!! i absolutely love Myrninn.. even tho i dnt love him like i love Shane- its different- but i still totally adore him!! he is so cute and olden style and he is always looking after Claire and protecting her- even if he is the one who got her into the trouble in the first place :P- and he always listens to her and her only! >.<i honestly thaut Oliver did betray them.. but OH MY GOD!! i cried so much wen Sam died!! it was so sad :'(stupid Bishop, i was like 'holy crap he is indestructable' after he got the poison and then he got thru Michael and went after Shane.. but then Myrninn came to the rescue-- AND MYRNINN DUSNT HAV THE SICKNESS ANYMORE!!

Rachel Caine is brilliant, six books into a series and she can still throw in plot twists and turns that keep me guessing every single time! I know when I pick up one of these books that I can't have anything important to do because once I start I'm not going to stop until I'm done! The characters are perfection every book. I love how Claire gets stronger and stronger, she has really learned how to hold her own. Mrynin, oh my gawd! that vamp, he keeps on surprising me! I loved the addition of Ada the computer type machine that took Mrynin 300 years to build. Of course I'm still loving Shane and Claire together. Towards the end I was freaking out thinking NO!!! you can't leave it here, you just can't!! I'll let you read for yourself to find out if she left it there or not. I'll be picking up book seven just as soon as I can clear a day to read uninterrupted.If you haven't read The Morganiville Vampires then what are you waiting for? Pick it up you won't regret it!"}, {"userName": "Myndi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3243221-myndi", "userReview": "This book was full of excitement and confusion and a lot of warring emotions. It takes you on a ride from fear and betrayal to understanding and acceptance and then of course the dreaded cliffhanger at the end.The vampire war comes to a climax in this edition and we get to see which side will be triumphant. We get to see how many losses we must suffer in the process and how that takes it's toll on our favorite characters. Claire is still front and center and being used as a pawn by more than the people you'd expect. She gets caught in the middle time and time again and seems to be always in the wrong place at the wrong time...or is she in the right place? I love the relationship between her and the housemates. Each relationship being different, but somehow making this tightknit and unique group of friends who would do anything for one another. It's rare to find that kind of friends and it's very satisfying to read about them.I will continue to read the Morganville Vampire books and I definitely recommend them for fans of the genre."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Wardrip", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125613-jennifer-wardrip", "userReview": "Reviewed by Jennifer Rummel for TeensReadToo.comClaire and her friends are divided over the recent events in Morganville.

He's kept a death grip on the town ever since. Now an underground resistance is brewing, and in order to contain it, Bishop must go to even greater lengths. He vows to obliterate the town and all its inhabitants-the living and the undead. Claire Danvers and her friends are the only ones who stand in his way. But even if they defeat Bishop, will the vampires ever be content to go back to the old rules, after having such a taste of power?", "title": "Carpe Corpus\n      \n          (The Morganville Vampires #6)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5212771-carpe-corpus", "average": 4.21, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388214475l/5212771.jpg", "reviews": 973, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15292.Rachel_Caine", "name": "Rachel Caine"}], "type": ["Paranormal", "Young Adult", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5212771-carpe-corpus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6420988-carpe-corpus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6588896-carpe-corpus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13632547-carpe-corpus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27266.Glass_Houses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33128934-stillhouse-lake", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544257.Midnight_Alley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261122.The_Dead_Girls_Dance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2295829.Feast_of_Fools", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies"]}
