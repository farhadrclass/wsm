Too bad it's not from a list of my choosing because we all know how absolutely relatable that would be.Two second in a title for an educational book sounded perfect. Not enough to bore, just enough to enlighten. True to it's name, it was a quick and painless read. What I walked away with, throw out your waste. What my imagination heard and will forever link it to, \"BRING OUT YOUR DEAD!\"Thanks Monty Python for making me the office leper yet again."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647632-lori", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Paul Akers is quite enthusiastic about Lean and his enthusiasm is infectious. This is the perfect book to read if you are interested in Lean principles and how to incorporate them into any aspect of your life- but you tend to fall asleep reading technical books, looking at statistics, and trying to interpret various charts and maps. The chapters of Akers' book are brief, written in layman's terms, include color photos, sum everything up at the end, and are actually pretty entertaining. He also includes several links to YouTube videos and other relevant, illustrative information.Noteworthy quotes:\"Lean does not make things more difficult. Lean is focused on intentionally simplifying any process....Lean is not about working harder and more frantically, but about making things simpler. It is not just about making everything faster, but about improving the quality of everything you do. It's rarely a huge or drastic change, but baby steps in an endless drive to continuously improve everything every day.\"\"Lean is about fixing what bugs you.\"\"Everybody wins- another benefit of Lean.\"\"...I asked the VP of (of Toyota) a very direct question, 'What is the most important thing for Toyota?'...Without hesitating, he said, 'The most important thing for Toyota is people. Toyota is all about teaching and training people and building a culture of continuous improvement.\"\"My mistake had to do with my incorrect focus on processes. I needed to focus on building a culture of people who understand and embrace continuous improvement.\"\"He understood that if you made things simple, there was a much greater chance of people understanding and implementing the ideas.\"\"When money is no object we abdicate our most powerful resource: our ideas. It just gets too easy to throw money at problems and yet we see time and time again that money often creates problems rather than solving them.\"\"When humility becomes a central attribute of the Lean leadership, a vortex of creativity and buy-in will follow. When there is a culture where people know there is not an egomaniac in charge, they begin to grow and thrive.\"\"This is the spirit of a Lean culture. When the leader is willing to be corrected and has no ego issues with sharing credit, that same generous and supportive spirit flows between everybody.\"\"...I should have been making videos six years ago, but I got paralyzed because I wanted everything to be perfect. I bought all kinds of film gear and lighting and software, but I never made a video because I was waiting for everything to be perfect. Then I realized the folly of that. If you just do it, you'll learn so much by 'just doing it.' That is really the story of 2 Second Lean. If you just make a small improvement, you'll learn so much that the next improvement will be that much better.\"\"We are very deliberate in how we hire people. We look for two characteristics- people who are humble and curious. We want people who don't act and feel like they know it all. We want people who are naturally curious about life.\"\"Focus on you. Focus on eliminating your waste.... When people see how much your area has improved, how much easier your work is, how much more they can depend on you, how consistent you are and how the quality of your product improves, they will want to know how you are doing it. Then you can show them. And then they will be eager to learn and begin their own Lean journey. But do not try to get your wife, your dog, your hamster, your cat, or your co-workers to do Lean.\"\"My Favorite Principles: Make people the center focus of your life. Pursue the right thing over profit. The profit will follow. Teach and train...\"\"You can organize waste.\"\"Lean has been misunderstood to be the methodology of taking away jobs, making things sterile with little or no creativity. Lean is the opposite of that. Rarely, if ever, does it take away a single job. It creates boundless opportunities and continual employment, adds longevity for existing employees and growth for new people to be brought into the company.\"\"When I go to hire someone, I always hire for character and teach for skill. I can teach anybody to do the job, but character is a rare commodity.\""}, {"userName": "Tyson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42066312-tyson", "userReview": "Poorly written and full of dumb jokes and shameless self-promotion.

It was interesting how small improvements can help your daily routine, even small ones, and how if something is bothering you, fixing it can help a lot. The first half of the book was pretty interesting but as nearing the end, it seemed to go on forever. This book is more for business owners and workers than for students but this book really connected to what my teacher is trying to do to our industrial arts classroom. Our shop class takes place in two shipping containers. Sometimes it is hard to find a place for everything. We try to consistently make two second improvements to the classroom and eventually we will be more organized and processes will be simpler. One example of a great improvement we made was putting velcro on hand sanitizer and attaching it to the wall. That way we can easily find it and it is not taking up space."}, {"userName": "Sarah Bradshaw", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75571244-sarah-bradshaw", "userReview": "Entertaining, and mindset-shifting.

A colleague recommended it, saying it was much more readable than the Toyota Way which he considers \"too academic\". I am now regretting my choice as 2 Second Lean is full of fluff. There are a few good pieces of advice on how to implement lean, but they are buried in long winded anecdotes and a constant barrage of boasting. You might think that would make the book too long. On the contrary, it's totally anemic, a very thin read even in the third edition with multiple extra chapters. Unfortunately being short does not mean that the scant pages are packed with good information.Most worrying, to me, is the cult-like attitude Akers adopts. A lot of his advice sound like the precepts of a religion rather than practical advice. For instance, he speaks repeatedly about how one should not try to force others to be Lean, but instead focus on one's own waste. Never criticise others for being wasteful! Look first to the waste in thine own eye. Except, I guess, if you're a manager or own your own company, at which point you have to force all your employees to undertake Lean and fire those who don't. This sounds like a very nasty setup to me, one that forbids you from criticising anyone above or around you, but encourages criticising those below you.Akers, who has never attempted Lean at any position lower than owner of his own company, has no useful advice for low level grunts pursuing Lean in a culture that has not embraced it. Instead he says, if you are a lean superstar you will very quickly succeed and be promoted to a level where you can implement lean reforms. Pray to Lean, worship Lean and you will be rewarded...One anecdote near the end stuck out to me particularly. Akers insists that anything that stops work is bad, and cites as an example, traffic lights. But what is better than the traffic light? Why, the noble roundabout of course! Roundabouts are magical and everyone always understands them. As someone who has actually lived with roundabouts, I had to shake my head hearing this.There are a few useful titbits in the middle and it does give you a broad overview of the concept of continuous improvement. If you are interested in CI/Lean but afraid of reading, this book should serve as a good primer on the subject, but I would definitely treat Akers' boundless enthusiasm with a pinch of salt.Also, don't pay for this book like I did. The eBook and Audiobook are available for free off his website."}, {"userName": "Travis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28849804-travis", "userReview": "This book should be re-named \"Lean: My Excuse for Living an OCD Life\". While it's fun to hear Paul's passion for Lean, for his company and for life in general, the contents of the book are half-baked at best. Paul shares a lot of interesting stories, most of which are self-promoting. Through all the stories, the takeaway is, unfortunately, limited to reducing waste. While it's true that reducing waste is a key component of Lean if that's where it ends the entire point of Lean is missed. Lean is about maximizing customer value through a reduction of waste, not just eliminating waste. In fact, the definition of waste is any product, process or system for which the customer would not pay.Unfortunately, Paul spends a lot of time talking about eliminating things that bug him or are less efficient and very little time talking about what the customer values and focusing on that."}, {"userName": "Suhrob", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1859963-suhrob", "userReview": "A very simple, basic book written in a completely straightforward, layman language.It is totally unpretentious and down to earth.I also know my rating is biased upward because I listened to the (free) audiobook narrated by Paul Akers himself and he is comes over as a very likable and enthusiastic character (which I'm sure helps his consulting career selling almost trivial stuff - I know it sounds cynical, but I think it is pretty accurate and I don't mind - this is all ok with me! :).Do I think this approach to lean is better than the other sold by other consultants... not really (I think NOBODY actually knows - there are no studies).
