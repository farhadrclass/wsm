Luz, a twenty-four year old comes to her homeland Spain where she is about to figure out that it was a bad choice. Her naivety and sweetness is what draws the readers toward her. The most beautiful feature in her was that she loved passionately.But deception, wildest desires, secrets follow her on her way. There are two utterly handsome men who come in her life and turn it upside-down and inside-out. Their personalities are so opposite and yet you can't choose whom you like the most. As much as the novel is beautiful and satisfying, it contains the same amount of peril, passion and opportunities for the protagonist. Another thing is, it was a hot piece of novel. Hannah Fielding has the talent to speak the stories that are forbidden. She writes them effortlessly. She can have the ravishing effects on your mind and yet she does it flawlessly. Wonderfully she captures your attention and lets you visit places. No wonder that she has won humongous awards for her books. Fantastic thing about this novel is that you don't need to read the first one to get engrossed in it.

If there is one word to sum up this novel, it's PASSION! Pure unadulterated passion. There is intrigues, jealousy, heat, in a beautiful setting with an author that can never be called brief when it comes to descriptions of scenes. At times I would get frustrated with all the descriptions, (why I gave it 4 stars), because I wanted to continue with the scene at hand/ or the dialogue I was waiting for.

I was immediately enchanted by her almost poetic way of writing. Due to my very busy reading schedule I haven\u2019t been able to read more of her books. So when the February Fiesta blog tour invite came along, I decided to see it as fate. I cleared out my reading schedule so I could review \u2018Masquerade\u2019 for my tour stop. \u2018Masquerade\u2019 is the second book in the Andalucian Nights Trilogy but can be read as a standalone. \u201cFate had not yet lit up the winding pathway of her life nor the echoes of history along it, but now, in front of this stranger, a disturbing awareness leapt into flame deep inside her and began to flicker intensely.\u201dSigh.. There really is something special about Hannah Fielding\u2019s writing. When I started reading \u2018Masquerade\u2019 I was soon completely pulled into the romantic and poetic way Hannah Fielding writes her stories. Although the beginning was a little slow, it soon became impossible to stop reading. The sentences Hannah writes are just so beautiful and they made this book so much more romantic. I honestly couldn\u2019t put \u2018Masquerade\u2019 down, and although there are 442 pages.. I read this one in just one day. \u2018Masquerade\u2019 is the story of Luz de Rueda, a twenty four year old woman who returns to her homeland Spain after living in England for the last couple of years. Luz is a beautiful, passionate and kind woman. At times a little na\u00efve.. but definitely a great main character. It was easy to love Luz. And I loved the way she loved so passionately. The two male characters the rich businessman Andr\u00e9s de Calder\u00f3n, and the young gypsy Leandro are definitely two handsome, toe-curling man I couldn\u2019t get enough of. I loved reading about these two very different and charismatic man. And although I expected what was going on with these two early on, there were still enough secrets and passionate moments to keep me wanting to keep on reading. The romance between Luz and Andr\u00e9s and Leandro was just so pure and beautiful. I really felt those butterflies while reading about their story. And before you decide you don\u2019t want to read this book because of the two male characters and you\u2019re not into the love triangles.. Trust me when I say you just have to read this book and let all those reservations go.. This is an amazing, and beautiful love story and you just have to read it. And although I haven\u2019t been to Spain myself, I\u2019ve always had this interest in this country and the passionate Spanish people. So since this book takes place in Spain, it definitely made this read even more fascinating to me. I loved the scenes where the characters where enjoying the beautiful Spanish beaches. It definitely made the cold Dutch evenings a little warmer.If you haven\u2019t read a book by Hannah Fielding before, this is your change. Her books are beautiful and just so romantic, you\u2019ll never want them to end! It\u2019s a promise!"}, {"userName": "Elien", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6205678-elien", "userReview": "This review and more on  So BookaliciousMasquerade is the second novel in the Andalucian Nights series. Earlier this year I read Indiscretion and I really liked that one. So I was excited to find out that it was part of a series. Masquerade follows the story of Alexandra\u2019s and Salvador\u2019s daughter, Luz de Rueda. The book is again set in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain, but this time it is in the early 70\u2019s. I really like the writing style of Hannah Fielding; it is excellent for historical fiction. She brings the world alive with her descriptions of the sceneries and cultures. Fielding did a great jog bringing the beauty and the culture of Spanish society. And that is exactly what I am looking for in a historical fiction book. I like to learn new things when I read a book and since it is set in the past it is important that it is as accurate as it can be. Besides I do not know much about the early 70\u2019s in Spain so it is nice when the author describes everything so well. Luz was a fun character to read about. She has a really strong personality, once she has set her eyes upon something she has a hard time to get her mind of it. And she cannot be persuaded to do so even when she knows that it would be the right thing to do. Luz also had a strong sense of pride and you better not hurt it because she was not someone who easily forgets about it. And that is exactly what I liked so much about her; she might not have been the easiest person to be around but at least she was real. So often characters are way too perfect; but Luz had her imperfections and that made her so much more special to me. But there are also a couple of things I liked less about this book. The biggest problem for me where Luz her love interest(s). She did not know Leandro she had just laid eyes on him for a minute, yet she claims to love him. Clearly she did not know the difference between lust and love and it annoyed me. Then there was love triangle that was thrown in. I am not the biggest fan of them, never will be, so I would not have minded if it had played a lesser role in this book. And my last point is that at some moments during the book there was not enough action for me. There were a couple chapters where nothing really happened and I just feel like it would not have hurt the book if it had been a bit shorter. Overall I really enjoyed this book. The descriptions are beautifully done and the overall storyline is good if you are looking for a nice romance story. You do not need to read the first book in the series in order to read this one. I would still recommend it if you want to avoid spoilers and to give you more of a background story. I cannot wait to read more books by this author and I hope that the next book in this series will come out soon."}, {"userName": "M.C.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6742623-m-c", "userReview": "I literally just finished reading this book and rushed on here to write my review. I loved it!It's a romantic, atmospheric story taking place in 1976 Spain, among all the political and social turmoil of that time. A young writer, Luz, is torn between two men who look somewhat similar, but who are very different in both character and situation. One of them (my personal favorite) is a hot gypsy, Leandro, who makes passionate love to her and then seems to forget all about her.And then there's her employer, Andres, who is a bit of a mystery. We follow Luz as she tries to find herself, goint to colorful balls and strolling along warm Spanish beaches -there's also a gypsy woman who keeps waylaying her, insisting on reading a dark and dangerous fate on her palm and many more.The mystery is more of a general air of foreboding, but there is a wicked twist at the end which i did NOT see coming. I mean, i suspected something at the beginning, but by the end it was obvious that I had been wrond. And then, BAM. That's what made me love this book so much, to be honest. The surprises.There's also a hidden family history, which is always fun to discover little by little when reading this tpe of romance novel, but what stood out most for me was the general sensuality of the writing style.The heat was there, but it was tastefully written and really subtle, so that it made me feel the feels along with the heroine, and not just stand by as an observer. When she was in love, in doubt, in turmoil, I could feel everything along with her; that's what I really enjoyed here. This was honestly one of the most aesthetically pleasing and sensual books I've read in a long time.Of course, the setting played no small part in the sensuality of the novel. Cadiz came alive for me, and it was as though I was there, tasting the saltiness of the sea water and watching the bulls run.This book is the best kind of romantic fiction: sweet, hot, a bit angsty and a little vintage.

Each scene was written with a certain allure that it practically painted a picture on your head. For my understanding the beauty of Spain was deeply portrayed in such a way it momentarily transports you to the beautiful beaches there. Despite this fact I just couldn't finish the book. The story was written beautifully but my interest didn't particularly stay. This also can be another case where I took way too long to finish the book thus waning my interest.

Luz was a strong heroine freelance biographer that didn\u2019t need any help taking care of herself, as she doggedly pursued finding the truth. She had differing relationships with both Leandro and Andres that did not take easy straightforward paths. As the reader it was obvious how she could be drawn and intrigued by both of the leading men of this wonderful tale, not fully understanding each of the men\u2019s motivation and purpose in her journey. This book had intrigue, mystery, revenge, passion and tantalizing love scenes that held captive the reader and didn\u2019t allow a moment\u2019s rest through all of the twists and turns.

I literally couldn't put it down, but at the same time, I was dreading finishing the book. It was so good. And the thing is, I read the 3rd book in the series first, so I'm reading the series backwards now, and I literally know almost every single character presented in the story. Every now and then I'd go like: Oh isn't Lorenzo Luna's uncle and isn't that person someone's daughter. It was so much fun, I've memorized their family tree by heart. But what never fails to captivate me is the portrayal of Spain's brilliance (And maybe also that of the Spanish men... Who am I kidding? Definitely!). That intensifying energy/tension that's always expressed between the couple in every single Hannah Fielding book has become my favorite feature ever in her novels. It's a trademark of hers, I'm sure. I've never read anything quite as similar. When Leandro and Andres were introduced, I was like 100% sure they were the same person, despite Luz's assumptions that they might be related. But the fact that Leandro's eyes were green while Andres' were black literally made me stay up at night thinking how the hell that might actually work. And I'd go like: Did contacts exist in the 70s? I had no idea. But then when everything began to unravel, what with the gypsies and Leandro's mother's and his uncle's vengeance and all that... Things started to click into place, kind of. When he came clean to Luz at the end, my heart literally shattered into pieces. This book was a pure piece of heaven. Makes me want to visit Spain and fall head over heels in love. Perfect.

The books are alike in many ways - the way the story is written is beautiful and very descriptive, the chemistry between the main characters is awesome and the characters themselves are nicely fleshed out (with the exception of Leandro who remains a bit... insipid for a long time as he stays in the background a lot, so I was more attached to Andr\u00e9s till the end). I also liked how the Spain of the 1970's was painted, like I had enjoyed learning more about the 1950's in book 1.Usually, I don't really care for love triangles, but the one in \"Masquerade\" worked most of the time, even though we don't see Leandro as often as Andr\u00e9s - the feelings she has for both men are written convincingly and the emotional turmoil this causes her made sense. The story also took a great turn at the end; contrary to the first book, I enjoyed the whole plot and even though there are clich\u00e9s here again, they didn't seem to be so dominant and the twist at the end was especially well written. I did see something like that coming, but it was satisfactory to have guessed it right. It was nice that Luz was allowed to react to what was happening accordingly and that she didn't just ignore it.Since Luz is the daughter of the protagonists from \"Indiscretion\", Alexandra, Salvador and some other already known characters show up again and what happened back then becomes important for this story; I really liked those links, even more so because when reading the first book it was like some drama just went away and wasn't resolved, so it was nice to see consequences and that these conflicts were properly resolved. Considering that Luz has her own problems (and not just the ones she inherited), I wonder if they will affect the last book of the trilogy.I was somewhat disappointed with the characterisation of the 'gypsies'; it was again quite one-sided and mostly negative. I know that the author based them on her experiences with 'gypsies', but I still didn't like it. They are wild, dangerous and fixated on revenge, at least that's the picture I got. That the upper class of Spain has these prejudices makes sense, but that's also (mostly) how they acted on their own... considering that one of Luz' love interests is a 'gypsy', a more balanced representation would have been better. But maybe I'm over-interpreting and I do have to admit that it's just a relatively small part of the story. That aside, I enjoyed \"Masquerade\" a lot. I like the way it's written, the characters and their relationships were interesting and the love stories made sense and convinced me. 3.5/5 stars._________I received a copy of this book through Netgalley.

I read the first one a while back and I had liked it a lot. This one follows the story of Alexandra's and Salvador's daughter, Luz and her journey is the lavish Spain of the 70s.Again...I am in love with the writing style of the author! It brings not only the world alive, but the characters as well. She creates so much emotion and feeling. I highly applaud the writing! She truly did justice with bringing the beauty and drama of Spanish society alive yet again. It makes me want to read more by the author.Ooooh poor Luz. I do feel bad for her, oddly, because all she really wants is love and to have a perfect life in Spain. However, her parent's past is now haunting her unknowingly. Leandro's mom has revenge in store for Luz, even though Luz had NOTHING to do with what happened years previous - she wasn't even born yet! Yes, I do feel bad for Leandro as well (kinda) even though he felt entitled to help out his mom. I am annoyed that they fell so quickly for one another. They pretty much had lust and love from the moment they locked eyes. At first I was on team Leandro, but then he leaves her with a broken heart, so I am on team Andre. However...I don't trust Andre all the way either. I must admit....I did like the love triangle. WHAT? Yes, you read that last sentence correctly. It worked well and it made the story way more interesting. The two men are similar in looks, but they are polar opposites in lifestyle, but I don't trust either of them. Andre did earn major points in the end, but I still don't fully trust him.The middle did have a dry spot for a few pages. Once the dry spot was over, I could hardly put it down.THE ENDING!!! Ugh! Such a cliff-hanger. So many loose ends that need to tied up! Hopefully there is a continuation of the story. In the end, this was good. I liked it as much as the other one. I think I connected with Luz more so than Alexandra. Oddly enough, I liked the love triangle. It worked well and it mixed well and made sense. I am team Andre, buuuuuut I still don't trust him entirely. I don't trust either of the guys. I truly hope the next book is a continuation of this story, because I felt there were so many loose ends that I need a conclusion for. I highly encourage reading book 1 before diving into this one. There is so much back story that is essential to this story (at least in my opinion).

Among a myriad of 50 Shades of Grey mediocrity, this one really stands out. I forgot what it was like to read a truly well written book, by an author that knows how to keep your attention without eliciting eyerolls at every love scene. I loved the characters of Luz, Leandro and Andres, simply fell in love with both men, and couldn't rest until I found out what happened with them till the end.My only tiny tiny annoyances were with the sometimes too eloquent descriptions of flowers, gardens, landscapes etc, however that isn't really a drawback, since the author's style is almost poetic. Maybe the annoyance came because I was so frustrated and in a hurry to find out what happens next with the characters, and those descriptions were an unnecessary distraction at the time. :) My other pet peeve was, perhaps a personal preference, but I couldn't help myself roll my eyes and cringe a little every time Luz's description highlighted how \"tiny, skinny, thin\" etc she was, and that being such was equal to perfection. I kinda wished to read for a more natural woman, let's say a bit more normal and curvier than the grasshopper figure that came to mind every time I read about her. But still. Maybe in another book. All in all great read, can't wait to start the third book."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30416014-melanie", "userReview": "Luz is a write spending time in Spain.

This one made me want some Sangria and the beach :)This was such a well written book that took me on a mini vacation and a little bit back in time. The story line was strong but I have to say I struggled a bit while reading it. Nothing to do with the story but a lot to do with my mind space at the time. Reading a book while having a book hangover can be challenging sometimes.With that said, I will revisit it after a while and only then will I be able to give an honest review."}, {"userName": "Lizzy Baldwin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35228241-lizzy-baldwin", "userReview": "Right so first things first I have to mention that this is the second novel in the Andalucian Nights series so I\u2019m already a little behind. However the book follows the life of Luz Maria Cervantes de Rueda, the only child of Count Salvador. Luz however is far from home and has spent many years studying abroad; however the time has come to travel back home to be with her family and start a career. However she meets two men \u2013 Leandro and Andres. Who will win her heart? Either way it\u2019s going to be a pretty wonderful summer.So there\u2019s the basics of the book \u2013 a little stereotypical a little tired, maybe, but the writing style really brings this tale to life. Fielding really knows how to write a historical fiction and her descriptions of the world around her is written with skill, understanding and knowledge. The scenery, the culture springs from the pages and you find yourself wrapped in the warmth and feeling of a Spanish family. I very very rarely come across books that deal with the time period of the early 70\u2019s in this country so it was a refreshing change to see this as the main period focus during the book.Overall Luz is a lovely character; a strong character although a little stubborn. Not always the one to make the right decisions she lives in the moment but has a pride you would be silly to mess with. I liked the fact that she wasn\u2019t a goodie-two-shoes type of character. She gets things wrong, she picks herself up, and she carries on. I think too often we are subjected to \u2018perfect\u2019 characters that don\u2019t quite work for me; here getting an imperfect protagonist really worked.This book however wasn\u2019t without wobbles for me. Firstly our two love interests \u2013 as with a lot of romance books I\u2019m sad to say there was a lot of instant attraction, love at first sight kind of mumbo-jumbo. Now don\u2019t get me wrong I love a good romance but this was definitely a lust fueled romance hiding as love. It just made me angry because Luz doesn\u2019t seem at any point to know the difference between the two. The love triangle felt a little tired and I must admit I\u2019m not a fan of love triangles because they always leave the reader hanging and leave too much to be desired between a relationship for me. If a single relationship was worked and built better that will excite me more than a less built three-way triangle.Additionally another wobble; Fielding paints an incredible picture of Cadiz and yet the characters lacked the same level of detail and importance for me. I think that the city almost came across as more important than our characters and although I adore good, well built up environments especially in historical fiction here I wanted more from each of the characters to mimic the authors skill writing about places.Overall however this is a lovely little beach read that I would definitely have me wishing of sangria, beach towels and sky-blue skies. I thought that the ideas were there, the scenery was there but the lack of complete character description and at time dialogue meant that the script became a little dry and not all consuming. Definitely an author I want to read more from, just maybe this one wasn\u2019t quite for me.*I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6289818-amy", "userReview": "If I could give 5 stars just for setting, I would. Hannah paints the most amazing backdrops for her characters but I do wish her characters had as much life. Still, I enjoyed this trip back in time to the 1970's. Open the doors or pages in this case, and be transported to the summer of 1976. Luz de Rueda has returned home to Cadiz, Spain after spending years in England. A freelance writer who works as a biographer, she enjoys her work because it allows her to be herself, free to do as she pleases. Having always considered herself a free spirit, she discovers her life is nothing as free as that of a gypsy \u2013 one in particular. The young, handsome, and very sexy Leandro is not easily forgotten, not even when she meets her new employer, Andres de Calderon who is practically his double. But the two men are complete opposites yet both inspire her deepest desires. The question that needs to be answered is\u2026which will her heart choose?As usual, Hannah Fielding has painted an extraordinary picture of Cadiz. Her settings always take center stage in her romances. As much as I love this quality about her writing, I wish she could extend it just a bit more toward her characters. Whereas the city is one of the characters in the story, and although I enjoyed the premise, the mystery, and found it intriguing, I wish the characters had a bit more life to them. I wanted to feel more of what Luz was feeling and there were times when I wished I could have put some words in Leandro\u2019s mouth. Andres was probably the most alive character in this story. The love triangle is a good one\u2026I think I lean more toward Andres being the better man although, I\u2019m not sure I totally trust him but Leandro needs to grow up. I should warn that it does end in a cliffhanger and so if you\u2019re not prepared to read the next book, you might be a tad disappointed\u2026I\u2019d like to know what happens.MASQUERADE by Hannah Fielding is a beautiful journey back in time to a beautiful city to experience a story filled with passion, heartbreak, revenge, betrayal, and love\u2026the only question is with whom does our heroine find herself finally falling in love\u2026the sexy gypsy or the sophisticated and refined gentleman?If you\u2019re a fan of beautiful settings, fabulous imagery, and descriptions that make you feel, smell, and sense the place then definitely read MASQUERADE, book two in the Andalucian Nights series by Hannah Fielding.

She is a writer whose next job is to write the biography of a famous artist. Her life will become an exciting adventure once she meets an enchanting gypsy and later her attractive 'boss'. Both men will haunt her dreams and will awake her deepest desires. 'Masquerade' has more than 400 pages but you never feel like is a long book. The writing is beautiful and excellent. The author describes the scenarios with such power that is easy to get lost in the reading. Spain continues to be a perfect place to romance and forbidden passion. The story is solid and every aspect has been planned in detail. There are many surprises and each chapter has its magic.Luz is a great character, as a Spanish woman educated in London she has more liberal ideas about women behavior and love. Still her Spanish roots make her a passionate and strong woman. There are many traits of Luz that reminded me of her mother or father. The author created a lovely woman, faithful to her heart and brave. Both, Leandro and Andres are handsome men with a fire inside that calls Luz. Each one brings a new ingredient to the story and I could love them both.Unlike the first book, this one has a more relevant sexual component. The tension is suffocating and the relationship between Luz and Andres is burning hot. Their encounters are steamy and sensual, their attraction is electrifying and you can almost feel and touch the passion.If you have read any book by Hannah you will love this one. If romance is your genre of choice, you MUST read \u2018Masquerade\u2019.

You can read this book as a stand alone, but if you have read Indiscretion some of the characters overlap and will help your understanding of the undercurrents of the novel. Spain, as depicted by Ms. Fielding, is a conservative, almost backwards society where castes and prejudices are not only alive, but thriving. The world of wealth and privilege that the main characters live in is taken for granted. Designer clothes, good looks and yachts don't make for very happy people, though. The backstabbing and games are elevated as if lack of financial struggle means the people spend their time trying to outdo one another for title of \"worst person ever\". The heroine of this story, Luz, is a 24 year-old virgin (the year is 1976!). I kept having to remind myself that this book supposedly occurs after Woodstock, the sexual revolution, but before AIDS. Antiquated ideals of a woman's purity remained in this book. It seemed more like the 1950's (or 1800's). Luz's asexual life until this point explodes in a off-the-scales hot affair. The story really is about her sexual awakening. She first falls in love with Leandro, a gypsy, whom she encounters by chance. Then, she falls in love with a hidalgo (gentleman) who happens to look EXACTLY like the gypsy, except with a different eye color. This is the most fantastical part of the book, to me. Is she really so na\u00efve? No one in their circle of friends comments on Leandro/Andres's use of colored contacts? The complications of a relationship between a gypsy and a gajo (wealthy person) are eclipsed by revenge, prejudices, superstitions and vitriol. I loved the book. Ms. Fielding describes Spain so beautifully. While the drama was over the top, I couldn't put the book down. Really, I give it 4 1/2 stars."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9594917-lindsey", "userReview": "Revenge, passion, betrayal, love.These are all the main themes of Masquerade, the second book in Hannah Fielding's Andalucian Nights trilogy, a romance set in 1970s Spain.When Luz de Rueda travels to Spain for a job as a famous artist's biographer, she meets and falls in love with two very similar and yet different men. Leandro, a mysterious gypsy who she meets soon after her arrival, stirs her heart like no one before, but after falling in love and then being spurned by him, she finds passion with another. Andr\u00e9s, her new boss, sets her on fire with his touch, but his back-and-forth behavior and apparent rivals confuse and hurt her at seemingly every turn. Masquerade is a book about how one can find love and passion despite almost insurmountable odds.I very much enjoyed this story, to the point where I think it's my favorite in the series so far. Luz was a very relatable character and the heartache and turmoil brought on by her feelings for both men were very compelling.I also liked reading about the gypsy culture and seeing the characters from the previous book, Indiscretions, make an appearance. The danger and antagonistic tendencies of some were well written and definitely had me worried about what would happen next.Like always, Fielding does a great job of painting a scene, and I felt like I was in the book and going through what Luz did. I loved the descriptive imagery in this one.Masquerade is definitely worth a chance and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a romantic, emotional read.Please Note: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.
