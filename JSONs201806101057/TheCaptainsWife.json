The author took forever to get into some action and conflict and even then it felt like a sneeze that wouldn\u2019t come. The first 160 pages followed the same formula, Captain shows his wife Mary Patten how to take nautical measurements and chart course. First Mate Keeler fails to drive the ship as fast as it can go. Captain reprimands First Mate Keeler. Keeler seethes. Hit the reset button and start again. The entire time the reader is itching for some conflict, explosion, outburst from someone, anyone just to break up the repetition. Finally around page 180 or so the conflict between Captain and First Mate erupts. This is what those 160 pages have been leading up to, but it\u2019s a huge let down. The entire confrontation is over in a blink of an eye and for all the build-up, and was totally unsatisfying.Then the remainder of the novel returns to formulaic pace. Mary Patten takes nautical measurements and charts course. Second Mate Hare doubts his abilities to run the ship. Mary nurses the unconscious Captain. It was so frustrating! This story had everything going for it and there were so many elements the author could have used to better advantage, mutiny, grave illness, an angry sea, a ship full of sailors under the command of a woman. I have been trying to figure out which one of those was the story\u2019s antagonist. But none of them were strong enough to be considered the antagonist. Then I thought perhaps this novel wasn\u2019t about the conflict but the journey. This idea left me just as cold. Mary didn\u2019t grow into the strong woman she could have during this journey. Outside of the few pep talks to the crew and the nautical readings she did little an actual Captain would do. I was hoping for her to turn into a strong, take no prisoner, swashbuckling captain, barking orders and ruling with an iron fist by the end of the voyage. Sadly, not only did she not grow into that strong role, but at the end of the book she states her opinion that women are not equal to men and scoffs at the idea of the Suffragettes using her as an example of equality. In the end this book left me wanting more and feeling completely unfulfilled."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6459063-sarah", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the story in this one. The author chose a story rich in detail and potential and just expanded on that beautifully. What results is an engaging novel that keeps the reader engaged from port to port. I really have to commend the author on the pacing he employs while writing this. I found that there was never a time where the reader was bogged down too much in downtime. The times when the ship was becalmed or peaceful days of sea travel were offset by the tragedies of sickening captain and mutinous first mate, safely navigating the ship through perilous seas and horrific storms, and all while trying to figure out how to survive till San Francisco.My one critique would be how the author would get far too technical at times. There are extremely detailed passages in this book on navigation, the intricacies of the sails and rigging, and how a clipper ship is run and sailed. While yes I can see the place some of this would have in the novel, far too many times the reader is bogged down in excessive detail to the point of eye-rolling and skimming to more juicy parts.Altogether, this is an enjoyable novel from the Age of Sail. It tells an engrossing story of survival and triumph in a way that doesn't make the reader tired to the effort. Yet, it must be noted that this novel could have benefited from some extensive cutting of technical aspects badly. But, overall, I enjoyed this novel immensely and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Age of Sail novels, especially ones with strong female leads (they're not that common)."}, {"userName": "Janellyn51", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2059478-janellyn51", "userReview": "This was a really nice little book.

Kelley has fictionalized Patten's unique story, using nautical records, newspaper articles, and interviews from the time. The result is an entertaining and suspenseful romantic adventure story for those who prefer the made-for-TV-type version of Patten's life at sea to the scant but factual information available. Kelley's Mary Patten is quite the wonder woman. Courageous and attractive, Mary is tough and noble, which enables her to learn navigation, take command of Neptune's Car, nurse her unconscious husband, and deflate the mutinous rumblings of the troublesome and demoted first mate, all the while keeping her pregnancy a secret for fear of the crew doubting her physical capabilities.My review: A decent fictionalization of a real incident. Kelley wows us with his historical nautical research and grasp of sensory detail - I felt the cold waves sweep over the bows as the ship rounded Cape Horn. Character development is a bit lacking. Mary, her husband Joshua and the second mate Hare are wise and noble and self-sacrificing. The \"antagonist\" first mate is a brooding bully. They start out that way and end that way with no personal growth or insight.The story itself is fascinating. I always thought women were considered bad luck on ships, so to find that captains regularly brought their wives and sometimes children on long voyages was very interesting. Kelley uses a writerly device in the beginning with a prologue set during the most dangerous part of the voyage, then reverts to linear narrative to show us how Mary and the ship arrive in such straights. This is a good thing, because the story starts slowly and Kelley spends waaaay too much time (over 150 pages) getting us to the dangerous sailing. Without the tease at the beginning, I'm sure many people would give it up as a dull read.Another oddity about this book: the Author's Note and Acknowledgments in the back of the book feels abrupt and incomplete. I turned the page to read more and found a blank page. It seemed to end in the middle of his story on how he did his research - which as a historical fiction writer, I always enjoy. Maybe this is a defective copy or maybe Kelly just wrote a lousy Author's Note!"}, {"userName": "Sabrina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1261615-sabrina", "userReview": "Douglas Kelley took known facts about the Neptune\u2019s Car voyage and created a beautifully impressive story around it. For a 1st novel it is very clear the man can write. The research was thorough and authentic, giving me the chance to experience the story, not just read about it. I could picture the sails firm up with wind; describe Mary and the helmsman struggles against the wheel and feel the spray from the ocean. Kudos to Kelley for giving me a chance to live this story.I love this story and yet, how scary. What was Mary really thinking, how was she feeling and how the heck did she accomplish what she accomplished. It\u2019s not to say woman aren\u2019t capable, just that they didn\u2019t do these things back then. For Mary Patten to be able to take command of a clipper ship and set its course is pretty amazing \u2013 historic actually and I wish there was more known about her. Thank goodness she learned navigation! And to think none of this could have been done had she not had the seamen\u2019s support. But, it\u2019s very clear she did because there was a capable 1st mate available. He may have been mean, hard and in custody, but he was experienced and a man. That the crew rallied around Mr. Hare and Mrs. Patten instead speaks volumes.The love between Mrs. Patten and Joshua was very tastefully written and I only hope was that sweet. It seems so, through the limited comments Mary Patten made and the dedication shown to her husband during and after his sickness. What a sad story all around.I enjoyed reading the Epilogue which discussed what happened after the voyage and answered some of the questions that came up during the story. I too wish that we could know what happened to Mr. Hare, what was Mr. Keeler\u2019s fate and why did he do what he did. Was he partly or wholly responsible for Mr. Patten\u2019s illness? The last couple of lines in this book are perfect: \u201cFor the duration of this voyage, his actions were significant and his life important, but in the broad sweep of history, he fades into anonymity. His story, like that of Joshua and Mary Patten, is a short one, lasting 138 days. All else is as fleeting and transient as a wake upon the ocean.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1955236-christine", "userReview": "The Captain's Wife is based on a true story. During the days of the merchant fleets, post California Gold Rush, a young captain takes his wife on a trip from New York to San Francisco. They're newly married, and this is the second trip she will take with her husband. She is certain it will be her last, as purchasing a permanent home and having children is in the near future.We join the Captain as he is making final arrangements for his trip. He has a strong, fast ship and a great crew. His one problem is that his first mate is ill and can't make the trip. He wants to wait to find a good first mate, but is pressured by the ship owners to find a suitable first mate and get the ship moving. There is competition to beat two new ships, and the owners are feeling the pressure.The Captain grudgingly hires a first mate he has doubts about and they set sail with fanfare. The first part of their journey is a love affair with the ocean. The wife continues her training on navigation from her husband and enjoys the calm waters.With all good stories, things don't remain calm. The weather challenges the crew. First with no wind, and then with severe weather as they approach Cape Horn. The entire time the Captain wonders about the first mate. It seems like he's sleeping on his shift, keeping the sales loose instead of maximizing wind capacity, and bullying the crew. Without sharing too much, I'll say that the first mate ends up in chains in the \"hole.\" The Captain becomes ill, so ill that he loses consciousness and can't lead the ship. The second mate can run the ship, but he doesn't know how to navigate. This is when the Captain's wife steps in. Working with the second mate, they round Cape Horn with the ship in one piece and get the ship to their destination.It was a great read. I learned a great deal, and Kelley did a good job of bringing the characters to life. I'd recommend this to lovers of historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46830-paula", "userReview": "Good historical fiction read based on the life of Mary Patten"}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10196629-beverly", "userReview": "I decided to read this book based on a Reading Group Choices recommendation. I actually did end up enjoying it but someone who knows about sailing would enjoy it a lot more. The story is based on a rather obscure event that began in 1856. This time frame was when clipper ships were in vogue and moved supplies between New York and San Francisco. Mary Patten was the 19 year old wife of Joshua Patten, the captain of Neptune's Car. Mary and Joshua have not been married long and she is making plans to travel with him for the second time. They will be taking supplies to San Francisco, having to travel the dangerous route around Cape Horn and word has that the weather is the worst it's been in some years. Captain Patten ends up hiring a new first mate, needing one and having little choice. Mr. Keeler readily admits that he's had trouble with his employment on other ships but that he's an experienced sailor and will do a good job. As the trip progresses, the first mate ends up in chains for trying to start a mutiny, the captain falls gravely ill and the weather worsens by the hour. Young Mrs. Patten, along with Mr. Hare, a young man just 2 years older than her that has been training under her husband's watchful eye, have to somehow traverse the dangers of Cape Horn and the horribly inclement weather and get the ship to San Francisco. It is a sea-faring adventure that practically made me seasick to read it! It was very interesting and you certainly come away admiring the perseverance of this young woman and the crew that stuck by her. My only problem was that there was much discussion about sails and tacking and ropes and booms and it was very confusing since I know nothing about \"rigging\" on a boat."}, {"userName": "Noel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/291748-noel", "userReview": "This is one of those books that I bought while on vacation, probably visiting a seaport, I read 20 pages or so and dropped the book thinking it was boring. A couple of years later, trying to get my Mt TBR down, I picked it up again, thinking I'd give it one more cursory glance and put it on my AVL list. Ten minutes after starting it, I was hooked on the story, more than that, on the characters, as my great grandmother married a seafaring man from Boston in 1853. While he was away at sea he wrote to her often, and I am now the owner of those letters. I was fascinated as this book is based on the true story of Mary Patten and her husband, Joshua. Joshua is Captain of a barque headed from the East Coast to San Francisco in 1856. He takes his wife with him as was common at that time, but is strapped to find a first mate until the last minute. His last minute choice will reap havoc on board as Joshua gets deathly ill, and his first mate gets thrown in the brig. Luckily his wife had learned to navigate and his 2nd mate was hard working, knowledgeable if not experienced and trustworthy. Between the two of them they take the ship through Cape Horn, one of the most treacherous passages in the world.The book resonated with me as I found many similarities with my greatgrandmother and her first husband (whom we think was lost at sea), and for the strength of Mary, who not only tended her husband but managed to get the ship through the straights during awful weather, with a mutinous crew on board.

As mentioned in other reviews the majority of the story is given away on the back cover but I was still kept interested. The beginning of the book did not give me high hopes. The author is very enamored with the idea of Mary Patten being a wonderful, strong, intelligent, funny woman and it comes across really strong in the beginning. A little too much love for the main character for my tastes. This does calm down eventually though and the story of the journey itself is pretty amazing. There's a lot of fascinating information about this story online which I recommend reading. The epilogue switches modes into a history of what their life was like after the journey - I'm torn on whether I like this or not. On one hand it would have driven me crazy not knowing how their lives ended, but at the same time it's a very blunt, sad ending. As with all historical novels I'm left wondering how much is fact and how much is fiction. There's a lot that seems to be implanted for the sake of interest (the relationship between Mary and the 2nd mate for instance). This is a fun book to read just for the fact that it tells such a great story and I'm glad I read it."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1261756-sarah", "userReview": "Mary Patten discovers what she is made of on an ill-fated voyage around Cape Horn.Okay, this wasn't exactly my cup of tea but it wasn't totally awful.

It's a bit of a slow burn - takes a little while to get into. But Mary is an enjoyable woman. The book is a bit deceptive, though - it doesn't focus quite as much on Mary as one would expect given the title and blurb. But the ship's voyage is interesting enough. It kept an even pace throughout. It's interesting to note that this is based on history; however, I found the epilogue (which is really more of an author's note) a bit jarring - it breaks the flow of the narrative too much to seem like a proper epilogue. I think of this as a Treasure Island for adults except without the treasure or the island. And, simply because it also features a woman's adventures with the sea, I was reminded often of Ahab's Wife, though that is much more richly detailed.

Gave it too my husband to read since technical books are his favorite."}], "description": "Based on the true story of Mary Patten, The Captain's Wife begins in July 1856 during the heyday of the great clipper ships. Mary's husband, Captain Joshua Patten, is hired to navigate Neptune's Car on a treacherous voyage from New York to San Francisco through one of the most dangerous straits in the Western Hemisphere Cape Horn. Early on, trouble erupts on the ship. When the first mate is put in chains for plotting a mutiny and the captain falls ill, Mary must take command of the ship. Having learned how to navigate during her last voyage with her husband, Mary is forced to put her skills, authority, and wits to the test as she demands respect from the crew, nurses her husband day and night, and keeps the mutinous first mate at bay. Using little known facts about Mary Patten's life, Douglas Kelley has crafted a brilliant and gripping tale of deception, danger, and treachery on the high seas.", "title": "The Captain's Wife", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78681.The_Captain_s_Wife", "average": 3.61, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1309212274l/78681.jpg", "reviews": 58, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44681.Douglas_Kelley", "name": "Douglas Kelley"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Adventure"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78681.The_Captain_s_Wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2242931.The_Captain_s_Wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19468649-marital-communication", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1013527.Stories_from_the_Blue_Moon_Cafe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26449864-moral-talk-across-the-lifespan"]}
