In fact, it felt like the first chapter of a book. I understand it is a serial but I am not sure that was the fight way to present this story. I mean I was just getting into it and bam, it's over. Now I have to wait and try and catch the next part(s). Also, from reading some of the other reviews, the parts are fairly pricey considering how little story there is. I guess I will just have to wait and see if it is worth continuing. I only gave 3 stars because there isn't really enough to judge. I liked what was there, but there wasn't a lot there though."}, {"userName": "Nigel Hall", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15353577-nigel-hall", "userReview": "Man Lenny is my hero!!!!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie Gails", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13529272-stephanie-gails", "userReview": "Really good opening...off to read part 2."}, {"userName": "Read Ng", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8414890-read-ng", "userReview": "This was a free ebook. Just something that was highly rated, but I knew nothing else about. I was traveling and needed something to read on the plane.This was a very interesting short story, but it is obviously from the title, only the first in a series of stories. I was disappointed in that in reads too much like only the prolog of a bigger story. It is enough to capture your interest and want you to continue the story, but it is not a story unto itself. You are still waiting for the characters to develop.Have a GoodReads."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5765641-christine", "userReview": "I'm mad about apocalypse stories, with or without zombies, and this book didn't disappoint. I think it's really hard to develop three dimensional characters in a short story, but I felt the author did an excellent job here. The dialogue was natural, the scenes were vivid, the editing was good. Not sure what more I can ask, other than to be compelled to turn the pages, and I was.I really look forward to seeing where our people are headed. Guess I'm off for part two."}, {"userName": "Edwina Callan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17316622-edwina-callan", "userReview": "Not to Author: Ca\u00f1on City, Colorado is not spelled Canyon City.

I like the concept of this short story but it doesn't even feel like a story, it's just like an introduction to the next part and as a stand alone I felt I didn't get enough from it. Maybe that's the point, you pay for this then if you like the idea of it you pay for the next part (which is another short again). When the series is completed I'm sure it will be decent but at the moment it's like different parts of one book that you have to pay for and I've just paid for the prologue and there wasn't enough for me in this to know if I would even like it."}, {"userName": "Doug Bowden", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12504432-doug-bowden", "userReview": "Finally a book written just for me. Let me start with the bad. It's a short story and so is part 2. That's all. And now with the good. Everything else. According to book 2 there a full length novel on the way in march for book 3. The main character seems to have just the right amount of edgyness, but humor at the same time. I think we may see some romance budding between Lenny and Rebecca. And the actions scenes make me feel like I'm watching a movie. Love it love it love it!!!"}, {"userName": "Kevin Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15644824-kevin-pierce", "userReview": "So I finally got around to reading this as well as part two. This book was great, but what makes me angry is waiting for the next installment. It says the third book is a full novel and I hope it is because I don't like the whole serial thing. I get letting a reader test the water first and I think that was done with books 1 and 2, if book 3 is another short story I'm gonna lose my mind.
