I love a good communes-and-cults book, am fascinated by members/characters' quests for belonging, meaning, explanations, family, origin stories, and stories of where and how we'll all end up in the end. This book has all of this, in spades; there are cults within cults and virtually every character is questing for all of the above. This tangled web of questing characters, as intricate as a map of meteorite crash sites scarring the earth (something that's in the book), creates a kind of crazy, frozen lakey, Upstate New York Gothic Vortex into which the reader is sucked like a vulnerable, emancipated, aged- out orphan seeking refuge (also a book reference).Of course, where you have questing vulnerable humans, and cults and communes, you also have con men and women, traveling snake oil seance-holding salesfolk whose livelihood involves controlling others and keeping them in thrall. So again, given that cults and communes are abounding here, never outside a collection of Flannery O'Connor stories have you ever seen such a collection of various and sundry fictional con artists of various stripes, some nobly antiheroic, some deserving of at least some antipathy, and some seemingly downright cloven-footed.Samantha Hunt herself is a crafty con artist of an author who maintains a very delicate balance of keeping things juuuuust mysterious and intangible enough so that you really do feel lost in space for much of the time you're reading the book, but also grounds and specifies and humanizes everything juuuuust enough so that you are invested in the outcome and keep forging through, in the grip of suspense to discover whatever may be there whenever you may be fortunate enough to emerge through the shadows and into the other side. And what ends up being there is pretty crazy on one hand, and pretty traditional on the other hand, and all thoroughly acceptable by the time you get to that point, having been so well prepped - might we even say subtly, slowly indoctrinated - by Hunt throughout the preceding pages."}, {"userName": "Paquita Maria Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez", "userReview": "This got fairly kooky at the end, a little woo-woo, a whee bit whacked, and one very important mystery was very obvious to me the whole time, but for a good bit, this book was kind of saving my g.d. life all the same. A young woman and her aunt just felt like run-ang, but the young girl was pregnant, so they walked instead. For a long time. Strange happenings happened strangely. In an alternate timeline, kids grappled with life on a cult-y farm for wayward children before taking off with a charming con artist to live life in the big, open world where mysteries forever abound and wonders reach as far as the eye can see and...shit. Oh, and you fund this by exploiting other people with dead children by talking to their \"spirits.\" Ah, the romance of the road! Bandit life! Plots merge and things happen. I'm not sure why, but it was absolutely what I needed in the midst of a hard-ish time.

I very much liked The Invention of Everything Else. This one, in my opinion, was just alright.It certainly has its moments: striking, poetic, revelatory moments...I'm just not sure they're worth all the pubic hair, dirty pickup trucks, and gratuitous inventory of every last item in every last room in staccato, present tense prose. And, yes, we're all very aware of backward hicks and religious zealots. No need to keep informing us of them. I found the mystery engaging but a bit too contrived: Mystery for its own sake.I feel like every other book that comes out, lately, is some variation of this book. Yet someone must want to read it, since writers keep writing it, publishers keep publishing it, and buyers keep buying it.Kids today and their literature. *shakes cane*"}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "Ruth and Nat are two teenagers stuck in a religious group home in upstate New York. Unsure what they'll do when they turn 18 and 'age out' of the Love of Christ! facility, Ruth is ready to consider desperate measures to find some kind of future for herself and her best friend. An option turns up when the two meet a traveling con man, Mr. Bell, who suggests that they start profiting off Nat's reputed ability to speak to the dead - one he's so far only used to scare and entertain the fellow foster kids at the home. Mr. Bell also comes from an unusual religious background, we learn - his father was the leader of an apocalyptic cult. Is this commonality of experience the reason he's drawn to Ruth and Nat, or is there a different agenda behind his seeking them out?Intercut with Ruth & Nat's story is one that unfolds some 20 years later. Cora is a seemingly ordinary young woman with a normal job and life. She knows that her mother didn't have a good childhood, but those foster homes and abuse seem very far in the past. But when her boyfriend reacts very, very badly to the news that Cora is pregnant, an emotional crisis point is reached. Just at that moment, Cora's enigmatic but long-idolized Aunt Ruth appears. Refusing or unable to speak, Ruth leads Cora on a long walk through New York State, with no known destination.I picked up this book because of the comparison to Kelly Link, but I didn't quite feel the similarity there. Rather, I felt that this book was very much written in the style of a great deal of contemporary post-apocalyptic lit-fic. It's not apocalyptic (although there is that apocalyptic cult), but the way it is written makes modern life feel apocalyptic. The fact that all the characters are alienated from modern society (either emotionally or through forced isolation) contributes significantly to this, as does the narrative's occasional tips into the realm of the bizarre. The themes of the book are also ones that are present in much of the post-apoc genre.I liked the book, and moreover, appreciated that it was very well-crafted. I didn't emotionally love it, however... perhaps just because of the high unpleasantness quotient.Many thanks to HMH and NetGalley for the opportunity to read. As always, my opinion is solely my own."}, {"userName": "Ace", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23405868-ace", "userReview": "A complex and layered 'ghost' story, Ruth and Nat live in an orphanage (run by a complete religious nutter and alcoholic) called The Love of Christ.

As the kids travel along the country channeling the dead, another storyline is developing with Ruth's niece Cora. In some parts quite spellbinding, they trek across America to find something that Ruth wants Cora to see.

I am simply blown by the ways in which she strings words together- truly, as one of her characters puts it at one point - challenging the \"tyranny of fiction\". I am no poet myself so I am not going to pretend that I can write an analysis or otherwise render Hunt's style. What I can say is that, as a practical-scientifically minded person who teaches math for a living, I absolutely crave the soulfulness, joy/melancholy, ecstasy, sensuousness of the artistic... spirit (?), embodied so holistically in this work. Of course, to me, math is art, but that's not usually how I practice it (ah, standardized testing, Common Core, etc, etc, inane quantitative measures of intangible things). So in my \"spare time\" such as it is during the school-year (no children yet, which is why I still have some), I try to inspire (inhale, motivate myself) what creative energy I can (usually by reading fiction). This is one of those books that amply and even overflowingly fills the well depleted by my profoundly non-artistic day-to-day existence. Reading Mr. Splitfoot, I am fully immersed in a chaotic but attuned, blunt and melodious, simple yet so profound soup/dance/game/orchestra of words. Words that, in their at times discordant ways, birth an illusion (reality?) that is more true than most things I encounter in my daily trudging. This book is a hauntingly resonating, masterfully written artistic masterpiece.But it is also so much more than that, for the perspectives it presents, for the setting and content. Or perhaps, this work is art because of the ways it approaches the eternal questions (what is meaning? death? being a mother? told through the fevered dream-like narrative of an ex-cult member/family). A critic somewhere wrote that Hunt writes \"from the margins\". Indeed - this is not a story that takes place from within the comfort of that which most of us take for granted: a caretaker (or mother), a home, a steady job/income, a more or less \"typical\" way of interaction with the world around us. It's the story of abandoned children, well-meaning but religiously deranged individuals, \"unnatural\" (unconventional) attachments, con-men, people doing everything to survive, and others trying to make meaning after deeply troubled childhoods.For me, the content and perspectives were much needed jolt out of my insanely undeserved comfortable existence (the job, the cats, the house, the car, the food supply, the safety and comfort). If you've seen Winter's Bone, the mood Hunt builds is a bit like that. Not quite the same, but I haven't read or encountered anything like Mr. Spitfoot before, so it's difficult to draw parallels. It's just so ... quintessentially out-the-mainstream, marginalized American (American gothic, according to critics). And yet, despite, or perhaps because of, the characters' outsider-status, Hunt's writing helps us understand our own quests, troubles, ghosts, desires so much more clearly than we would if we were observing our self-imposed system from the inside.I absolutely LOVED this book to pieces, but although I would highly recommend it to everyone for its educational and artistic power, I couldn't guarantee that you will enjoy this - I would only hold some kind of hope. A bit like how I wave my hands around excitedly about math in class; while I win some converts every year, to many more of my students I am probably just the crazy math teacher. This book is not for everyone, and you may find it frustrating, especially since, as I mentioned, it's not written in a conventional style (basically, a poem in narrative form), and in general challenges all conventions through its characters, the setting, perspectives, etc. If you like your stories to stand on solid ground, I am just the crazy person waving my hands around right now. But, to each his own - life is awesome because each one of us basks in a different light."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/440212-linda", "userReview": "This was an impulse read and also a page-turner! The layout of the novel with chapters going back and forth between two women and time-periods made it very easy to read \"just one more chapter\".

To entertain themselves they 'speak to the death', bringing horror to some of their fellow orphans. After meeting the mysterious Mr. Bell, they find a wider audience, making some money in the hope of escaping their Love of Christ! home. Years later, Cora is living a life in this digital age where everything needs to be shared online, \"if we don't post it, it never happened\". Then one day Ruth turns up and whisks her niece on an adventurous walk to an unknown destination.Cora barely knows her aunt, having met her only once at the age of 11, and being infatuated with her ever since. \"I liked my mother fine, but Ruth was like being close to thunder. And then Nat. Lightning.\" Since Cora is in need of change in her life, she goes along without protest.A ghostly and supernatural undertone can be felt throughout the story. With a religious fanatic and an apocalyptic cult and its leader thrown in, it all felt a bit too unreal. As the reader, you are not sure what exactly is going on, and where and how it all fits together. Characters felt unattached and thus the reader too. It is an interesting story though, and readers who like their thrills to be a little bit unearthly, will definitely enjoy this.

Check out my take on Mr. Splitfoot.You can listen to my review here: http://wkar.org/post/book-review-sama...If you would rather read my review, you can do so below.\u2013Book Review: Mr. Splitfoot by Samantha HuntEverybody loves a good ghost story. And Samantha Hunt definitely delivers in her creepy new book, Mr. Splitfoot. This is a tale where orphans talk to the dead, scary cults promise answers to life\u2019s mysteries, and the only certainty anyone can hope for at the end is death.At the heart of the novel is the story of Ruth. She is an orphan who has been abandoned by the system and lives in a foster home run by a religious zealot. Ruth is homeschooled, learning only what her foster parents teach her about the outside world. When her fellow orphan Nat begins telling people he can speak to the dead, Ruth pretends she can too. With the help of a con artist named Mr. Bell, they begin charging people who are desperate to reach lost lovers, children and parents. The sessions begin with Nat speaking in tongues, followed by brief messages and random words. As soon as the sessions are done, the three escape with their ill-gotten fortunes.The other main character in this modern gothic tale is Ruth\u2019s niece Cora. She is hiding a pregnancy from the disturbed father of her child. His name is Lord and he promises to steal the baby once it is born and abandon it on the steps of a hospital. One day her Aunt Ruth shows up at her house and silently beckons Cora to follow her. Ruth doesn\u2019t explain anything to Cora, but her niece follows her without asking any questions. The two women move from small town to small town, trying to avoid the ghosts from their past. But everyone they meet along the way seems to have a ghost story of their own. From random strangers they meet on the road to the hotel workers who claim their rooms are full of dead people, Cora and Ruth never seem to lack for supernatural companions.What propels the narrative in Mr. Splitfoot is the feeling of hungry desperation. The characters are each seeking something, whether it\u2019s answers or money or peace of mind. That desperation adds an eeriness to the work and leaves a reader wondering if anyone can truly be trusted. It feels like there is something always hidden behind the smile.One thing that made this book stand out is that the ghosts aren\u2019t confined to a specific location. In most horror stories, you can find the monsters holed up in one spot or stuck to some cursed object. But in this novel, the ghosts are all around us. The feeling of unease extends beyond the creepy basement of a haunted house. It permeates the entire world.Like most ghost stories, Mr. Splitfoot does come with a surprising plot twist, and this one left me kicking myself that I didn\u2019t see it coming. It\u2019s not often that happens for me, and it\u2019s one of the reasons I loved this book. Luckily, I didn\u2019t lose any sleep over it, but the inventiveness of this tale will certainly haunt me for days to come."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael", "userReview": "Ruth and Nat are orphans living in what could only be described as a crazy cult. Many years later, Ruth\u2019s niece Cora finds herself pregnant. Ruth appears after years thought lost, but she cannot speak. She leads Cora on a mysterious mission, but where is she going? Mr. Splitfoot is an attempt at a contemporary gothic novel by author Samantha Hunt.I picked this book up from the library for a number of reasons. I wanted to see a modern take on the gothic novel and I was interested in the cult-like plot. This book sounded like something I would really enjoy. But sadly I felt like Samantha Hunt just tried to do too much in this novel and nothing really came together as expected. I felt let down by the book and my only consolation was the fact I borrowed the book from the library instead of spending money on it.Granted there is a lot of interesting elements within Mr. Splitfoot and by a more experienced writer this could of have been a beautifully layered novel. There is a touch of mystery, the gothic, the absurdity and horror elements to be found in the book. I felt like Hunt piled together every great idea she had and tried to pack it into the novel. This left me feeling like she had started so many threads but never actually finished them. The satirisation of religion, or the southern gothic cult, and the mystery or the coming of age story are all really good ideas. There are so many good ideas but at some point you need to stop cramming in ideas and focus on how they work together.Mr. Splitfoot is an example of why I should never listen to hype. I think it is an entertaining read and there is a little bit of everything. However I wanted more depth, more exploration. I like the ideas the book presents but then it did nothing with them. I felt like this was just sloppy but for someone wanting a thrilling plot, this novel might work. I know I have very different taste in literature to the norm; I just need to remind myself not to fall for hype.This review originally appeared on my blog; http://www.knowledgelost.org/book-rev..."}, {"userName": "Jeffry", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50940587-jeffry", "userReview": "With Mr. Splitfoot, Samantha Hunt perhaps creates a new genre: Upstate New York Gothic. Reminiscent of writers like Katherine Dunn, Kelly Link, Sharma Shields, and Flannery O'Connor, Hunt's novel is part ghost story, part thriller, part mother/daughter drama, and part road trip narrative. Some might classify the genre of this book as Slipstream or New Weird, and I think both are appropriate. The novel is tightly plotted with alternating chapters between the past and present that become increasing intertwined as the plot progresses. This mirrors one of the central themes: the impact of the dead upon the living whether we believe in the supernatural or not. Though Hunt's style is similar to the writers mentioned above, her voice is also distinct and she produces some grotesque and provocative imagery minus the intentional disjointedness seen in the work of other New Weird writers like Link. Hunt unsettles the reader through her voice and imagery while crafting a plot that moves with the pace of a classic ghost story or thriller. Her fresh take on the road trip trope in American literature is particularly noteworthy as well."}], "description": "A contemporary gothic from an author in the company of Kelly Link and Aimee Bender, Mr. Splitfoot tracks two women in two times as they march toward a mysterious reckoning.Ruth and Nat are orphans, packed into a house full of abandoned children run by a religious fanatic. To entertain their siblings, they channel the dead. Decades later, Ruth\u2019s niece, Cora, finds herself accidentally pregnant. After years of absence, Aunt Ruth appears, mute and full of intention. She is on a mysterious mission, leading Cora on an odyssey across the entire state of New York on foot. Where is Ruth taking them? Where has she been? And who \u2014 or what \u2014 has she hidden in the woods at the end of the road?In an ingeniously structured dual narrative, two separate timelines move toward the same point of crisis. Their merging will upend and reinvent the whole. A subversive ghost story that is carefully plotted and elegantly constructed, Mr. Splitfoot will set your heart racing and your brain churning. Mysteries abound, criminals roam free, utopian communities show their age, the mundane world intrudes on the supernatural and vice versa.", "title": "Mr. Splitfoot", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29065258-mr-splitfoot", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1455145376l/29065258.jpg", "reviews": 825, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/190905.Samantha_Hunt", "name": "Samantha Hunt"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Horror", "Fantasy", "Gothic", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29065258-mr-splitfoot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23719481-mr-splitfoot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25876042-mr-splitfoot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30075444-mr-splitfoot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35017330-mr-splitfoot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1238101.The_Invention_of_Everything_Else", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31702762-the-dark-dark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332768.The_Seas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35150761-a-love-story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17874102-the-yellow"]}
