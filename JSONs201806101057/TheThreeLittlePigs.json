Quite possibly!I think it's Emma's favorite, even though I don't think she's quite caught on to the think-ahead, strength-in-numbers, build-it-to-last concepts yet. She just seems to like to follow along with the exciting story and listen to my increasingly over-the-top Big Bad Wolf impressions. By the time we're done with this story I'm going to need a wind machine.I believe the Little Golden Book version was the one I had as a kid. The one Emma and I read was different. It lacked info on the author, who published it and when. There was nothing but the title, the story text and illustrations. Little bit odd how kids' books do that. I guess it's a public domain thing. Whatever. It matters not, because we pretty much love this story! We've read it a number of times and will no doubt continue to read it again and again."}, {"userName": "Angela Ferrari", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5339220-angela-ferrari", "userReview": "The pigs know they have to build their house. But the reason Ive always loved this book is it shows the differences among the siblings and it is much like real life. There is usually one who has to take care of the others mistake and they don't ask questions, just open their doors to family. I wonder why they never went back to moms house??Theme- brothers, mistakes, survival, sticking together"}, {"userName": "Phoenix2", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6542967-phoenix2", "userReview": "The three little pigs is one of the classic fairy tales that every kid knows.

I understand the authors\u2019 message in this book. Not only what he is saying but how he feels as he writes this book. The book is told through third person perspective. The three little pigs are trying to find a way to keep their houses strong to keep the big bad wolf away. No matter what happens to the three little pigs they are always there for each other. \"Three Little Pigs\" takes place in each of the little pig\u2019s homes. The setting is significant to the story, because it\u2019s about the wolf trying to blow their houses down. The time period is not stated. The theme I noticed in the book \"Three Little Pigs\" was staying strong together. Not only in this book do the pigs stick together but you always need that one person by your side through everything in life. I would recommend this book to children ages five to seven and adults. This book is adorable and has cute pictures that anyone could enjoy."}, {"userName": "Janet Coba", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59738396-janet-coba", "userReview": "My kids really love this book. I think they really enjoy it because they play out the story, and their dad plays the wolf. Well, most of us know how the story goes. There are three little pigs who know that the wold is coming. The three little pigs decide to go their separate ways and build their own houses. As the story continues, the wolf blows down house one and house two. The little pigsFrom house 1 and 2 run to the third house. The wolf cannot blow this house down, so he tries to force himself in. The three little pigs come up with a plan and the wolf ends up with a burnt behind and runs away.  I truly love this book especially because I have three little pigs of my own. I have three boys and they don't always see eye to eye. However, this book always reminds them how they have to sticktogether when they run into trouble. Together they are stronger then they are alone. Love this book."}, {"userName": "Jitendra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8234821-jitendra", "userReview": "Reminds you the lesson - think and work hard."}, {"userName": "Karina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12281208-karina", "userReview": "When I was a little girl I loved this book so much!"}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7039931-michele", "userReview": "Pretty much the perfect book for children.

One pig made his house out of straw, the other one out of sticks and the third brother built his house out of brick. The two first brothers were mocking the third one who made his out of bricks. This tale introduces the wolf as he approaches nearby pigs in order to eat them. The wolf destroys the house of straw and the house of sticks, as the ultimate alternative, the two pigs living in those house, were leftwithout choice as they ran to their brothers house made of brick and his brother opens his house to the other pigs. At the end the wolf couldn\u2019t blow the house built out of bricks, so he decides to enter through the chimney and he fell and died. The main themes are patience which the book shows us that It\u2019s not about building stuff in the fastest possible way, but about taking your time and making it right. Brotherhood can be seen at the end of the story when the third pig gave shelter to the other pigs despite being mocked earlier in the story.This story is really fascinating and I enjoy it every time I read it, it teaches us a very important lesson in life and its to not take the easy path of the road. The first two pigs, decided to make the house in the easiest possible way just to finish quickly and as the story goes by, they ended up dealing with consequences. In life we need to get stuff done, but not to only get rid of them, but to get it done in a way that they become effective. I recommend this book for kids coursing 1st grade and 2nd grade. Its never to early to show kids the importance of taking the hard way and making stuff right, rather than taking the easy way and then having to lead with the consequences. Always put your best effort in everything you do, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a small or big task, its about how you do it and the effects you want to show."}, {"userName": "Eboni Johnson", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64653203-eboni-johnson", "userReview": "The Three Little Pigs by Al Dempster is placed under Children\u2019s Literature as a folktale. It is intended for an audience ages three to seven years. This story is about three pigs and a wolf\u2019s journey. In the story, each pig builds a house \u2013 one of sticks, straw, and bricks. Then along comes a big bad wolf trying to fool the three little pigs - using trickery in hopes to eat the pigs. I rated The Three Little Pigs by Al Dempster five stars because of the dramatic illustrations, plot, and use of language. The illustrations capture the wolf\u2019s evil expressions and the silliness of the pigs. The plot shows repetition, but remain exciting, and the use of language is seen through the illustrations. As a child, I loved this book \u2013 the talking animals, trying to predict what was going to happen next \u2013 the rise and fall of the plot. Young readers enjoy stories that have a protagonist and antagonist, and The Three Little Pigs is a great story to have children reenact. When reading other versions of this book I often wonder if there was ever a story telling the wolf\u2019s side of the story \u2013 children would love to hear a version of that story."}, {"userName": "Edna Velasquez", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73414232-edna-velasquez", "userReview": "NoneK- 3This book is about three little bigs who decide to go their separate ways to build their own houses after knowing that the wolf is coming.

The illustrations, plot, and use of language is seen through the pictures in the book. I love how the talking animals are portrayed in this book.
