My mother has said yes. And so have I, deep in the darkness of my flesh. Will you help me? Tell me, Mother, will you? What's your advice? And you, dear aunts? Tell me, is it love? Is it really love that's troubling me so? Making me feel as if I'm about to drown...\" A realization I've made over the past few months is I have to read more Quebecois writers. Every single female Quebecois writer I've come across has been wonderful. I've read an H\u00e9bert novella and a collection of poems, this is the first time for me to read a full book and what an experience. I love it when poets write novels. And this one, although was difficult to follow at the start, is amazing and full of intrigue. And it was apparently based on a true story, one which took place in 19th Century Quebec.Elisabeth d'Aulni\u00e8res and Antoine Tassy, squire of Kamouraska. What else would a girl want? This is called a gothic mystery but I saw it as something more, as a woman in despair. She is abused, her husband openly cheats on her, and she perhaps falls for the first man who is kind to her, the first man she opens up to about her husband's abuse. Using this American Protestant man, H\u00e9bert shows how different he was from Catholic French culture:\"They're afraid of you, Doctor Nelson. As if, under all that obvious selflessness of yours-- too obvious, perhaps-- some fearsome identity lies hidden...That original flaw, deeper than your Protestant religion, deeper than your English language...\" I enjoyed this book very much. You feel the despair of a woman trapped, having nowhere to go, being forced to bear children and stay in a loveless marriage. This is the despair of a very young woman who seems to have aged before her time because of turmoil.

Based on the true story of the 1838 murder of Seigneur of Kamouraska by an American doctor in love with the Seigneur's wife, Hebert's novel shows us a respectably married woman remembering her great passion and the murder of her first husband. Much of the action takes place inside Elisabeth Rolland's head as she waits beside the bed of her dying second husband. The style is stream of consciousness at times, and it can take some effort to figure out just what is happening, But it contains an engrossing, frigtening account of how the doctor fled with his rival's body across the snow-blasted countryside of the Lower St. Lawrence. That by itself is worth taking the time to unravel the story. H\u00e9bert wrote in French but the English translation by Norman Shapiro captures some of the original text's force and beauty. And Jutra's film is breathtakingly beautiful, as well as considerbly clearer than the novel.

Passion and violence. Deathbeds. Fever. Madness. Forbidden passion destroying the lives of everyone in its wake. The dark tension-filled drama of long Russian novels. Anna Karenina or Doctor Zhivago, but the snows are Canadian and the language is French.Madame Rolland is caring for her husband on his deathbed. For years, she has been the image of respectability \u2013 crisp and frigid perhaps, but imminently respectable. Yet her mind is unable to extricate itself from her past. She is haunted, preyed upon by the passion and violence of her former life. Hallucinatory images from the past block the reality of present life from her psyche.The instability of Elisabeth Rolland\u2019s mind is reflected in the style of the writing. The narrative switches from present to past with no warning or apology; the main character is described in both 3rd person and 1st person, depending on the time stream she is experiencing; the stream of consciousness narration expresses the emotion of the story far more than the chronology of the plot. This was by no means an easy book to read \u2013 either in its content or its narrative flow. It expressed the aura of the Canadian winter with crystalline beauty, but I found myself resenting the lack of clarity or control in its emotional trajectory. The stream of consciousness style made it easy to enter into the emotion of the moment, but more difficult to step back and analyze the actions of the characters. When I found myself feeling sympathetic towards the characters who were plotting homicide, I knew this book would not be a re-read for me. *****If you appreciated this review, check out my blog at pagesandmargins.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Anda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3907410-anda", "userReview": "Ok, \u00e7a semble d'\u00eatre un romance-novel, mais en fait, c'est l'histoire d'une femme au 19\u00e8me si\u00e8cle qui se lutte avec les constrictions impos\u00e9s par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de ce temps-l\u00e0, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 traditionale et suffocante.

Hebert's story takes place in the town of the novel's title, a small community in Quebec. The time is the mid-19th century, decades after France's Canandian territories were taken away by England. Nevertheless, the Quebec motto \"Je me souviens\" (\"I remember . . . my language, my culture, my religion\") is evident everywhere in this story among the characters who are vividly of French ethnicity. At the center of the story is Elisabeth d'Aulineres, an unhappy wife of a brutal husband, who has an adulterous affair and bears her lover's child. So desperate is she to be with her lover, that she attempts to poison her husband. He survives, but is later shot dead by her lover, who then turns chicken and abandons Elizabeth by fleeing over the border to Vermont. Elizabeth serves time in jail, then is released, and later remarries, and has more children, though her second husband never really trusts her. Much of the book involves Elizabeth's shifting back and forth from consciousness to unconsciousness as she sleeps and unwillingly dreams of the dreadful turning point in her life. At times, she flashes back to her paranoia about being caught by the police for her crime. Generally, the narrative pattern is third person when Elisabeth is awake and tending to her her second husband or her children, and first person when she drifts into dreams, although Elisabeth's fearful, first-person thoughts may slip in pell-mell at any point. Hebert is able to fit Elizabeth into the role of victim rather than criminal by suggesting that her first husband was such a scoundrel that her and her lover's crime were justified. The psychological quagmire into which she is thrust, though, is a piteous one, and Hebert makes a strong statement about the plight of married women in general during this time period."}, {"userName": "Rebecka", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6476980-rebecka", "userReview": "This is an exquisitely well written book on one of my favorite themes, but it's also incredibly dense. I've been far too scatterbrained while reading it to fully appreciate it. I imagine Kamouraska is best read on a retreat away from any sort of distractions and especially any sort of stress, because this cannot be read while stressed.

Hebert's novel, Kamouraska, continues in this tradition. The novel opens in Quebec City, on a hot day of July (about 1857), in the home of the respectable Monsieur and Madame Rolland. Monsieur Rolland is dying, and his exhausted wife is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Beneath her mask of respectability, Madame Rolland carries a terrible secret, namely how, as a young woman, she became involved in an adulterous love triangle which led to murder. Sleeping only fitfully, the shocking tale of Mme. Rolland's early life is revealed (unconventionally) in fragments of dreams which seem to be equally made up of memory and nightmare. The reader accompanies her on this nightmarish journey. Hebert beautifully creates a sense of life in the charming small town of Sorel, Quebec in the 1830s. Her descriptions of winter are especially vivid. Though the winter is beautiful, it is also a sinister force which isolates and endangers the book's characters. The book is structured so that its short chapters brilliantly recreate the dread of a woman trapped between a present reality, and her fitful dreams. Both her present and her past unfold in fragments as she drifts in and out of consciousness. Mme. Elisabeth Rolland is a complex character, and the reader must decide how much she can be trusted to confront the history of her own life. In this regard, I was reminded of Daphne du Maurier's My Cousin Rachel."}, {"userName": "Amy Riggs", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18859059-amy-riggs", "userReview": "Though beautifully written, this story is not a comfortable one to read.

Je dois reconna\u00eetre que la lecture du roman m\u2019a paru particuli\u00e8rement ardue : j\u2019ai rarement eu affaire \u00e0 un texte si difficile \u00e0 aborder, si r\u00e9barbatif en quelque sorte. Un effort constant pour comprendre de quoi on parle, de quel moment, de quel lieu, de quel personnage, etc. Bref, se rep\u00e9rer n\u2019est pas chose facile dans cet \u00e9crit et il y a fort \u00e0 parier que ceci n\u2019est pas d\u00fb au hasard ou \u00e0 l\u2019inhabilet\u00e9 de l\u2019autrice. Les analepses, prolepses et pauses narratives sont l\u00e9gion. Le brouillage des rep\u00e8res rationnels semble miner le sang-froid du lecteur pour le pr\u00e9cipiter dans le monde effrayant et bouscul\u00e9 de la passion, des sentiments aussi imp\u00e9tueux que pernicieux. L\u2019h\u00e9ro\u00efne principale, Elisabeth, pr\u00e9sente d\u2019ailleurs les traits distinctifs de la femme fatale : elle inspire l\u2019amour fou tout en acheminant son amoureux vers sa perte. Et comme chaque figure de femme fatale, celle-ci n\u2019est pas unilat\u00e9rale mais porte bien \u00e0 confusion : est-ce une victime de l\u2019ordre social, de l\u2019univers masculin implacable, est-ce une incarnation de la peur de l'homme face \u00e0 ses propres d\u00e9sirs, face \u00e0 sa propre \u00e9tranget\u00e9 au monde structur\u00e9 dont il se croit l'h\u00e9ritier et le pilier ou bien serait-ce une cr\u00e9ature diabolique ? Le diabolisme est un motif r\u00e9solument d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 \u00e0 travers la narration. Voici un exemple : \"Antoine Tassy m\u00e9rite la mort. Il r\u00e9clame la mort. Par son silence m\u00eame. Par son inexplicable absence. Il vous provoque, comme il me provoque. Il veut se perdre et nous perdre avec lui. Ce d\u00e9sir de mort dans ses os depuis toujours. Allez-vous encore (\u00e9voquant la d\u00e9tresse d\u2019un enfant blond, miroir de votre propre d\u00e9sespoir) \u00e9viter de sacrifier Antoine\u2009? Tourner l\u2019arme contre vous\u2009? Le crime est le m\u00eame.\"Quant \u00e0 la peinture de la passion \u00e0 travers le style, celui-ci se fait volontiers expressionniste dans des passages comme celui-ci : \"Si je ferme les yeux, je te retrouve livr\u00e9 aux m\u00e9tamorphoses \u00e9tranges des m\u00e2les et des hommes.

Un matin, le coq s\u2019est pris les ergots dans la crini\u00e8re du cheval. Ton cheval se cabre. Se dresse sut ses pattes de derri\u00e8re. Le coq entrave d\u00e9ploie toute son envergure. Tente de se d\u00e9gager. A grands coups d\u2019ailes exasp\u00e9r\u00e9es. Se d\u00e9bat en vain. Coq et cheval ne forment plus qu\u2019un seul corps fabuleux. Un seul battement, un seul \u00e9cart d\u2019ailes et de fers. Un seul tumulte, hennissements, et cocoricos, emplissant l\u2019\u00e9curie de sa clameur, abattant les cloisons de la stalle. Dans un arrachement de plumes et de crins, de planches cass\u00e9es et de clous tordus.Je crie. C\u2019est toi, mon amour, cette fureur ameut\u00e9e.

Maybe that's not fair. Even with a universally unlikable character, a novel can still be compelling. And at times Kamouraska was, just not enough of the time.A greater complaint involves the admittedly unique narrative voice. While interesting, it struck me as too gimmicky. Much of story unfolds in the first-person ramblings of the sleep-deprived, fear-ridden (and some readers -- not me -- would say guilt-stricken) Elisabeth, whose verb-free clusters of nouns and modifiers mix past and present, husbands and lover, as well as various residences, within the same paragraph. The gimmick has some merit as a way of experiencing the inside of the heroine's scattered brain. But overuse of this voice becomes tedious and made this reader long for a clean narrative following a linear time progression. The ending left me wondering what the point of the whole story was, what insights into the human condition were offered. Yeah, I get that societal expectations could put a 19th century woman between a rock and a hard place, but by the end of the book, I didn't much care.On a happier note, the author's craftsmanship was evident in some striking imagery and an interesting sense of place."}, {"userName": "Robert Beech", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3349172-robert-beech", "userReview": "A psychological portrait, told in the first person, of a 19th century Quebecoise woman, accused of the murder of her husband.

L'amour na\u00eet instantan\u00e9ment entre les deux, amour d\u00e9vorant autant qu'il peut \u00eatre interdit. Les deux amants finissent par croire qu'ils ne peuvent exister sans la mort d'Antoine et projettent son assassinat avec l'aide d'une bonne, Am\u00e9lie. L'\u00e9poux \u00e9tant retourn\u00e9 vivre \u00e0 Kamouraska, la premi\u00e8re tentative de le tuer \u00e9choue et George part en tra\u00eeneau faire le travail lui-m\u00eame. Une fois Antoine tu\u00e9, les amants ne se reconnaissent plus. George s'enfuit aux \u00c9tats-Unis et \u00c9lisabeth est emprisonn\u00e9e pendant deux mois puis finalement rel\u00e2ch\u00e9e. Heureusement pour son avenir, J\u00e9r\u00f4me la demande en mariage et l'enterre vivante dans la \u00abbonne r\u00e9putation\u00bb.Th\u00e8me: la violence, le conformisme en sous-th\u00e8meStyle: Je mentionne tout particuli\u00e8rement la narration qui est un chef d'oeuvre. L'auteure nous entra\u00eene dans un d\u00e9lire, avec des volte-faces au niveau narratif tout \u00e0 fait spectaculaires. Dans le m\u00eame paragraphe le narrateur peut \u00eatre omniscient, \u00c9lisabeth, J\u00e9r\u00f4me ou un autre. L'auteur s'amuse \u00e0 le modifier sans pr\u00e9venir et le lecteur suit sans tr\u00e9bucher. C'est de la haute voltige. Le r\u00e9cit est celui d'une \u00e9vocation et reconstitution du pass\u00e9 qui mortifie la narratrice \u00c9lisabeth, femme ensevelie sous la conformit\u00e9 sociale. Le d\u00e9lire est terriblement \u00e9puisant, on sent la presque destruction psychologique du personnage. En fait elle est morte le jour o\u00f9 elle a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'amour et \u00e0 vivre pour sauvegarder son honneur et celui de sa famille.Un beau roman, une trag\u00e9die d'amour.4.5/5... j'ai moins aim\u00e9 ce roman que Les Fous de Bassan. Choisir le meilleur reste une question de go\u00fbt. Les deux sont tr\u00e8s bons et montrent combien Anne H\u00e9bert \u00e9tait une grande \u00e9crivaine. Je crois qu'il faut choisir selon le type pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 (roman d'amour = Kamouraska, roman-polar = Fous de Bassan)."}, {"userName": "Antonia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14723032-antonia", "userReview": "\"Who is Ultimately Guilty?\" is one of the essay questions my English Lit professor posed to the class. I recall writing and reciting an essay stating that \"Elisabeth D'Aulnieres is the one who is ultimately guilty\". I got some backlash from a classmate who felt that the main character was a victim, who should be sympathized, not accused. I can only perceive her as a manipulative character who influences others to do her will without taking any responsibility herself.I'm a big fan of Anne Hebert, and have read all of her novels.

Not too challenging for me as a university level french student. I enjoyed the plot, and slowly finding out what happened. I also found that it struck a great balance between the antiquity of the setting, and still sounding like it was written in the 20th century. The reason it only gets 3 stars is that it never wowed. I didn't have much of an emotional reaction, it didn't do anything to make it above average. So, a fine book, but nothing special."}, {"userName": "Andr\u00e9-claude Lebel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33729353-andr--claude-lebel", "userReview": "Apr\u00e8s quarante pages de confusion, on trouve enfin une certaine logique dans l'illogique de la structure.
