Our teenage protagonist, Avery, is attempting to piece it all together: a friendship that is becoming something more, a mother who fails him, and overwhelming, incomprehensible grief following the death of a loved one. Walton masterfully captures here the ways in which grief shatters one's narrative, the ways in which its sharp knives jab at unexpected moments.As Avery grapples with this most difficult of summers, he is also just a kid learning who he is. His phone is a landline named Susannah, poets become plants in his dreams, and his English teacher has loaned him a stack of books tall enough to last all summer (or maybe he'll need just a few trips to his nearest indie bookstore). Suffused with pop music and funeral rituals, and complex, genuine love, I Felt a Funeral, in My Brain is a nod to the vital importance of music and poetry as life-saving forces."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/684384-hannah", "userReview": "It's not often I read a book in one sitting, but this one grabbed me and wouldn't let go. Avery's world, shattered by betrayal and grief and reassembled with the help of a passel of poets will reel you in, rock you gently back and forth, and release you into the world, transformed."}, {"userName": "Tyler Goodson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7540065-tyler-goodson", "userReview": "On the first day of summer, Avery brings home a stack of poetry. Later that summer, as he tries to navigate crushing loss and disappointment, he turns to that poetry again and again; the reading and writing of it. This book is Avery's bold and thrilling record of his heartbreak, love, grief, and family. It's about creating art through pain, and dealing with pain through art. It blew me away."}, {"userName": "Barbette", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65318233-barbette", "userReview": "Walton is the poetry teacher I never had. He makes me want to eat up Sexton, Berryman, a host of other writers with a spoon. I left \"I Felt a Funeral, in My Brain\" wanting to read other books, and then this one again.I lapped Walton\u2019s words up, because there was a funeral in my brain, too. I inhaled his meditations and observations on how alcohol wrecks a family and leaves no one untouched. I felt hurt, but I also felt young and new and an empathetic kinship with the young protagonist.The poetry merging with prose format lends credibility, believability, and an accurate depiction of the strange sense of time and reality experienced by those floundering in new loss. My favorite book of this year. \"I Felt a Funeral\" is a book that matters."}, {"userName": "Rachel Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2173746-rachel-watkins", "userReview": "Being a human being is terribly hard. Those stuck between childhood and adulthood can be the most vulnerable, dealing with grown-up issues without the necessary emotional tools. In I FELT A FUNERAL, IN MY BRAIN, Will Walton shares Avery's story in a format that is totally original and a beautiful representation of teenager's inner emotional life. This book is a poem, a eulogy, and also a work of short fiction that you will never forget. Walton took big risks with this book and the payoff is huge."}, {"userName": "jaroda", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16654757-jaroda", "userReview": "One of my most anticipated releases of 2018, I FELT A FUNERAL, IN MY BRAIN is novel that reads like a poem. Avery is lost, trying to make sense of everything going on in his life. Inspired by the poems he reads, he decides to write his way through it all. Covering topics such as addiction, death and sexuality, Will Walton has woven a unique storytelling experience that is both brutally honest and honestly beautiful.

It's a love poem; it's a eulogy; it's poetry; it's prose; it's uplifting; it's heart-cracking.

Book! Because it's Will Walton writing, everything is tender and full of love, but also pain and questions and grappling with memories. I was struck by how different the prose style is here from his previous book, echoing the book's poetic concerns\u2013 it's not that it's more abstract, but rather both tighter and blurrier at the same time.

I don\u2019t generally like poetry so I knew this would be a tough read for me. I have a hard time understanding poetry. I kinda just want things spelled out for me. I really enjoyed the story. Only because poetry isn\u2019t my thing, I wish I could have gotten more detail about characters and events. It\u2019s not like the story was lacking in any way, I\u2019m just used to more detailed writing. I really liked Luca, but we didn\u2019t get a ton of him which made me a little sad. The format was interesting and different from anything I read. It jumped time back and forth a lot and that took a bit for me to adjust to on top of adjusting to the poetry. I\u2019m glad I challenged myself to read this. It was good. And I feel like I have a better appreciation for poetry and might try some more here and there, but it\u2019s just really not my thing. I\u2019m not sure I quite understood the ending. But that\u2019s okay.

The book is poetic and feels more like a grieving memoir than a fiction. The structure of the book adds to the weight of Avery's mind as some pages have as few as 3 words interspersed beautifully on the page. The story begins by quickly addressing that Avery has lost his grandfather, nicknamed Pal. The how is something we do not learn about the how until much further on as Avery recounts what lead to Pal's death. He recounts the struggles of his family's addiction to alcohol [2 generations of addicts] and his own understanding of his family's problems: his mother's current addiction to alcohol and Pal's past addiction. With his best friend, Luca as support, Avery doesn't go through this journey entirely alone. Both boys have dealt with alcoholic mothers; however as both boys find themselves in love with each other, the Christian ideals of AA adds another layer of stress for Avery.The book takes occasional detours to the present at Pal's funeral as Avery addresses those in attendance. These glimpses at the present are only told through Avery's own thoughts and give us brief insights into what Pal meant to him. As the book progresses to the climatic death, Avery's own telling of the story begins to breakdown. With a sudden shift to a numbered list of moments that jumps from before Avery's trip to say goodbye to his grandpa, to after arriving and back and forth until Pal passes. After the death everything feels cathartic. A release for Avery as he tells his mom that they will take each day together, one at a time. A release when he has sex with Luca for the first time. A release as he realizes that everyone, friends and family, will always be there behind him, whether he sees them or not. After it all, I really want to buy the book when it releases just to support the author. I sincerely recommend anyone and everyone familiar with death to read this. It is at times confusing and tragic but such is life after loss."}, {"userName": "christinemm", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15632140-christinemm", "userReview": "This short young adult fiction story is about a 16 year old male who is struggling. A deep thinking poet, he aspires to write more as he spends a summer recovering from a knee injury while taking doctor prescribed pain meds. Raised without a biological father his father figure is his best friend grandfather. The boy is gay and in the closet and in love with his best friend. Near the end we see his deeper thinking and his attempt to understand how adults cope when life throws you problems and non-ideal life situations. How does an adult cope, keep going, and rebuild a life? As he ponders adult struggles he seems in denial of his own internal struggle. I won\u2019t tell anymore lest it spoil the story. He also struggles with Christian religious opposition to his suspected homosexuality. This is about loss and grieving after death as well. Includes an influential positive teacher who wncourages his weiting and learning via reading books. Deep topics. I got used to the writing style, it reminds me of the thoughts that go through your head as you go theough your day but not writing out all the action or all the dialogue and lacking many descriptions of place, while also losing chunks of time. In the end you inderstand alk that MATTERS and it as an emotional punch. Effective writing conveya emotion and makes us care and think so I am rating 5 stars = Love It."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7185639-lauren", "userReview": "A very intoxicating (pardon the pun) little novel that is partly prose and partly something else entirely. Avery has lost his grandfather, a prominent and steady figure in his life, and uses poetry, music, dead poets, and experimenting with his own limits to cope. As he tries to understand the more \u201cadult\u201d things he is forced to deal with, his alcoholic mother, his grandfather\u2019s hidden alcoholism, a best friend/hook up partner who isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s ready for a full commitment, and his budding poetic soul, Avery dabbles in the bigger philosophical questions one begins to contemplate at that age. The story goes back and forth in time from his grandfather\u2019s funeral to the summer before. Parts of this were a bit jumbled for me. It didn\u2019t flow as well as it could have. But I LOVED Walton\u2019s poetic references. I made notes of every book/poet he mentioned and I highly recommend everyone finding Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s poem, The Fish, that Avery read at his grandfather\u2019s funeral. I happened to have a copy of Bishop\u2019s poetry, and I agree with Avery, it was very fitting for Pal."}, {"userName": "Theresa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3685174-theresa", "userReview": "My library received an ARC from PUSH/Scholastic. This is a book told with a train of thought that roams around just as an unsettled mind can\u2019t fixate on one thought at a time. Avery has just lost his grandpa, \u201cPal,\u201d and he comforts himself by writing poetry, remembering Pal, listening to Pop music, and thinking about Poets. This is a quick read, but it\u2019s also a lot to take in. It\u2019s an emotional roller coaster that covers death, grief, alcoholism, religion, sexual orientation and more. While some of the writing is beautiful and some of the thoughts profound, I had a hard time with the nonlinear writing style. Also, I\u2019m not a lover of tragic Poets or Pop music, so I had a hard time finding a personal relationship with Avery. Others might be more inclined to understand his metaphors.
