I think that I am struggling because I thoroughly enjoyed the story and don't want to be cynical but I think I need to be. The issues discussed in the book are as follows: underage drinking, illegal car racing, high school bullying, bomb threats, parents teaching children entitlement, parents rallying to fire a coach, paralysis, a car accident, legal troubles, premature labor, a premature baby in NICU, abortion, troubled marriages/divorce, pornography and I may be missing some. Yes, all those issues were addressed in this book and although it is a lot I think my real problem was they were all resolved by the end in a happy way. God answered all the prayers, everyone felt better and had resolved their issues. At one point in the book, it stresses that God answers prayers not as we want, but in his time, in his way and that everything that happens, God has a purpose for it. Yet, everything was fixed in the way that the characters wanted it to be. I wish I had faith in positive resolutions. I continue to remind myself that this is fiction and that the point was that God does answer prayers, continue praying and pray without ceasing. Reality brings us different answers."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754448-brenda", "userReview": "John and Abbie Reynolds have just survived a close call with divorce, but now their marriage seems to be on solid ground. John is still coaching football at Marion High School, and while he really tries to connect with his students and football players he is having difficulty with the team, they had bad attitudes and in general came off cocky,and the parents of the boys are even worse, having lost two of the first four games of the season, the parents are rude and condescending, threatening to get John fired if things don't improve. So when an unsigned letter shows up at the school questioning whether he is a good moral leader, because they say that he knows his players are drinking and drag racing but does nothing about it, and in an ironic twist of fate John is in a car accident, hit by a boy who was drag racing, while he survives he is paralyzed from the waist down. Can their marriage survive this, and how will it affect those around them?Karen Kingsbury's writing skills shine thru in this book, the characters come off as very real, as they deal with day to day struggles. I enjoy the way she weaves God's message throughout her books, her stories are always very inspiring and reminds the reader that with God all things are possible.While this is the second book in the Timeless Love Series, it can easily be read as a stand alone story, but I would recommend reading the first story, because you will get a glimpse of what John and Abbie's marriage endured, with the help of God.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an inspirational story, that has some substance to it, be prepared you won't be able to put this one down!Even though I was provided a copy of this book to review by Booksneeze it in no way alters my opinion of this story."}, {"userName": "Quiniece Sheppard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13545136-quiniece-sheppard", "userReview": "Wow. This book was amazing. So glad I read this book as I had heard of Karen Kingsbury, but never read any one of her books. I am now a supporter of her work. If I could sum this book up in a phrase it would be \"God still performs miracles\". Anything can happen if you are crazy enough believe in the impossible. That's exactly what happened in this book. Everyone experienced a miracle and it just wasn't one person as sometimes we believe that miracles only happen to certain people or they can't happen to us, but they happen to anyone who believes in the source of the miracle, which is God. I found myself rejoicing with John got the miracle of walking again even though the doctors told him he would be paralyzed for the rest of his life. I rejoiced when John's daughter got a miracle with the pre-mature birth of her daughter whom the daughters said would never make it. I also rejoiced in the re-uniting of a husband and a wife who were divorced but decided to give it another shot. There were so many miracles and acts of faith in this book that I'm not able to name them all. When God shows up, our lives will never be the same. We can't stay the same when we have God and that's another lesson this book teaches us. It teaches us that with God nothing is impossible. That's exactly what a miracle is. I can't wait to read other works by this author. This book was heartfelt and very touching. I enjoyed every minute of reading it."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2790490-katie", "userReview": "Although this was the second book in a series, I jumped right into the story without missing a beat. Karen skillfully wrote in such a style that it gave the reader enough background not to be lost in this next installment in the Timeless Love series. I instantly grew attached to John and Abby and their new-found love. Learning about how close they came to ending their marriage \u2013 and all the joys that they were experiencing since finding their love again \u2013 was beautiful. John and Abby viewed their marriage as something incredibly special and sacred\u2026making everything they did seems so pure and good. Their testimony was beautiful. I enjoyed every moment of reading about their renewed love with each other and Christ.The side story of Marion\u2019s Quarter Back, Jake, was also very moving. From his struggles with his peers and his divorced parents strained relationship, the reader couldn\u2019t help put instantly like the guy. Compared to his other peers, he seemed like a nice guy, and as the story progressed it was wonderful to watch him grow and mature. The hardships and sorrow he went through, while at the time seemed unbearably hard, only helped him to grow closer to Christ and build a stronger relationship with Him.It\u2019s been a while since I have read a book that has made me cry, but this one struck me hard. About half way through the book, when the crisis arose in John and Abby\u2019s life, Karen wrote in such a personal way that I felt the character\u2019s pain and confusion. I couldn\u2019t help but connect to them and feel for them as they went through seemingly insurmountable disaster. I found myself hoping for a good outcome right along with the characters! You know you hold a priceless book in your hands when this happens!There is only one caution that I must give my younger readers. In the book the subject of pornography is discussed between a father and son. I thought the conversation was very edifying in our world with the internet being so close to our fingertips, but depending on the age of the reader, it may be a little much. So I just caution my readers in this area \u2013 it\u2019s only discussed in one scene. There are also a few intimate scenes between John and Abby that might be a little much for younger readers. After going to a dance class, John leads Abby upstairs for a different kind of dance lesson\u2026things like that. Karen never is explicit, but says enough for the reader to put together the rest.As this book held my interest and kept me flipping the pages as fast as I could read them (with a box of Kleenex nearby), I knew this book would get 5 big stars from me. It was captivating, had an awesome story plot, was writing to perfection, and had a strong message against divorce, porn, and car racing. This is a book with a powerful story that will stay with you long after you have finished the book.I reviewed this book for Thomas Nelson/BookSneeze. The thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are soley my own."}, {"userName": "Nola Redd", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1015045-nola-redd", "userReview": "We met John and Abby Reynolds in \"A Time to Dance\", when they struggled to come together after 21 years of marriage. Kingsbury brings them to us again in A Time to Embrace, a novel of pain and faith.Everything seems to be back on track for the couple after their near-divorce scare. But one fateful night, a night when a few seconds make a lifetime of difference, changes everything. Abby and John must struggle to come together, and to come to the Lord.As John struggles with a newly imperfect body, he also struggles with his faith. Like any human, he can\u2019t help but ask, Why me? Why this? Why now? He wrestles with his pride and his anger. And yet, out of the ashes of his life comes forgiveness that witnesses strongly for his town.At the same time, Abby fights her own battles. With John\u2019s life changed, she strives to appear strong, to give him somewhere to lean on. She fights to support him and love him, even as he pulls away and becomes distant. And she tries to be her own source of strength, before she learns again to rely on her Heavenly Father.Mixed into the couple\u2019s struggle is the fight of those who love them. Their daughter, whose prayers helped save their marriage, now turns away from God. Their youngest son watches his dreams disappear. Their oldest son fights his own spiritual battles. And the boys who bear the blame \u2013 and their parents, who carry their share \u2013 must fight their own battles. Slowly but surely, each comes to see the hand of God amid the tragedy.Once again, Kingsbury has brought us a heart-touching tale that begs the question, why do bad things happen to good people? Her three-dimensional characters stand up to the challenges given, reacting realistically and drawing the reader further into the story. I did raise my eyebrows at the miraculous conclusion, which I didn\u2019t feel was altogether necessary, or even helpful. I loved watching John, his family, and his community come together, and felt that the ending read more as a \u2018feel good\u2019 ending than a realistic one. After all of that struggle, I don\u2019t think the surgery made for a happy ending \u2013 instead, the happiness came from the peace everyone found. A more realistic ending would also have helped provide hope for those who struggle with permanent injuries.Overall, the novel is an emotionally compelling read. The spiritual journey of each character, major and minor, kept the reader intrigued. Kingsbury has again managed to share a joyful story of a Christian family returning to God despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 their tragedy."}, {"userName": "Reanne Melhorn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12086891-reanne-melhorn", "userReview": "In this novel by Karen Kingsbury, there is an intense focus on love, loyalty, trust, and expectance. In A Time to Embrace, Nicole, Abby and John\u2019s daughter, discovers many things. First, she finds out about how John and Abby and almost divorced the night of her wedding \u2013 the night of their anniversary. As Abby tries to figure out how to deal with how to react to this new information (John\u2019s and Abby\u2019s affairs on each other), she also tries to balance her new marriage and college, and something else that she wasn\u2019t expecting, nor had they planned on happening, for several more years \u2013 Nicole was pregnant. As much as she wanted to feel happy about her new baby growing inside of her, she just couldn\u2019t. Nicole began to slip into a deep depression because of her pregnancy, afraid of all of the what-ifs that stood in her future. She had planned to finish college and start her carrier before they even thought about children \u2013 but her child had been an accident. Also, John gets into a horrible accident, caused by two of his own football players (gets paralyzed because of it) and faces losing his job because of a group of disgruntled parents. This series has to be one of my favorites, for sure! It has a rather addicting storyline, and I couldn't wait to finish it! Karen Kingsbury has a wonderful talent. I couldn't put it down! I am one that normally doesn't really like religious books, as I normally fimd them very dry and boring. It was actually quite the opposite here! I found this book and the one before it extremely addicting and inspiring. Reading this has made me want to be a better Catholic, as well...People who enjoy reading religious books would enjoy this novel, as it explores ones\u2019 own sense of religion, making the reader question oneself about how they had treated their religion. Also, people who enjoy romance novels would enjoy this book. People who enjoy reading a long, slightly more challenging read would also enjoy this book because it makes a person question their own morals on multiple levels. Generally anyone who enjoys a good book that challenges their mind would thoroughly enjoy this book. People who enjoy reading tragedies would enjoy this as well, being that there are many tragedies in this book, but not in the classic sense \u2013 more of things that people today would consider tragic to happen."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426353-ellen", "userReview": "A Time to Embrace by Karen KingsburyA Time to Embrace is a beautifully woven story about forgiveness and love.

I think I cried more and gasped more during this book than I have for any other novel. Abby & John had some problems, like most married couples do, but God helped them sort them out. They still are working out some problems, but you can tell that they love each other and God is going to help them through this. Their daughter Nicole has just gotten married & that's another key to fixing their marriage puzzle. The love these two people share is amazingly beautiful and the author, Karen, did an amazing job expressing their love through words. John is the high school's football coach and health teacher, and lately, the parents of the football team have not been very kind to him. They are petitioning to get him fired just because their sons are not as talented as the quarterback. But that's not the only thing causing problems, the main problem for John is that his star player, Jake, has some anger problems. But the day his dad buys him a brand spanking new hot rod, his mood changes and he starts being nicer to the people he's hurt most. A tragedy occurs and Abby is left wondering what went wrong, what she could have done and Jake is at a loss for words, wondering why in the world he did what he did. This book was amazingly written and I love the author's way with words. I could feel the love between Abby and John the entire time I was reading it.

I do believe in God and in the need for ceaseless prayer, but this part of the book was so distracting for me. Every prayer was immediately answered, and almost always answered word for word the way it was prayed. This does little to encourage me as a believer. I felt like every prayer had to be answered immediately as if the author thought we would forget, or give up our hope in God if the prayer wasn't answered in the very next sentence. In trying to see this book through the eyes of a nonbeliever, I think this would be taken to be childish and unrealistic, and the book discarded before they took away the real value of the message in the book. In this book, there should have been more spoken of the truth of prayer - that you have to seek to live in the center of God's will, and pray from that heart, not just 'ask and you shall receive' (immediately - before the beginning of the next paragraph!)."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43611-lori", "userReview": "Another amazing, fantastic read from Kingsbury.

I did enjoy reading the two books that make this series and the storyline, However, That being said,This book deals with a lot of heavy topics. Teenage drinking, street racing, paralysis, pre-term labor to name some. At one point one of the characters makes the comment of God always answers our prayers, not necessarily how we want but it a way He sees as best. And yet, somehow everyone in this book lives happily ever after.I am sorry but that is just not real life. Life is hard and challenging and at times it seems like you are in a never ending nightmare.
