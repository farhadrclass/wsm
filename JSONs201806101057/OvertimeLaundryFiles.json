'All bureaucracies obey certain iron laws, and one of the oldest is this: get your seasonal leave booked early, lest you be trampled in the rush.' He broke the rule and failed to book his leave in time. Not surprising considering the way the last book ended.

I have never heard of Charles Stross before, but who am I to deny myself of a free ebook, right?In \nOvertime\n, Bob Howard ends up being the night shift guard on duty on Christmas -- he didn't want to, but he wasn't able to file his holiday leave so he was left with no choice. Bob was prepared for an uneventful night alone in his temporary office, but memories of the Laundry Christmas party and some strange noises and temperature drops tell him that something else is coming -- through the chimney.I have never read any books from the Laundry Series, so the characters and the settings in \nOvertime\n were all new to me. I was kind of wary about that and I thought I would get lost in the story, but I was surprised that I wasn't. While I would want a better explanation of who the other characters were and what Laundry was really all about, I felt that this novella was still complete enough to stand on its own. It's very reminiscent to Jasper Fforde's work, with the same British humor (although I think Stross is Scottish) with urban fantasy tones. And I liked the Christmas twist on the story, too.I'm not sure if I want to splurge on the other Laundry series books, but I am definitely curious. I think I would need a little more convincing...but not so much. Any words to convince me to do so?"}, {"userName": "Elspeth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2765967-elspeth", "userReview": "This has some moments of mirth, but over all it was pretty meh-tastic."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david", "userReview": "This is an entertaining short story (and free download) in Charles Stross's Laundry series.

The play on Santa Clause is great and for a Holiday book it's a fun little tale. I like the Laundry Books cause of how wry and dry Bob is purposely designed and written to be and seeing the crazy cosmic horror world through his jaded eyes makes for a fun read.

It pokes a bit of fun at the English traditions, a lot of fun at corporate bureaucratic culture, and then wraps itself up in a tidy conclusion. As I was reading this, I thought my file was corrupted - I was 20 pages into a 38 page story and I still wasn't sure where the conflict was and had only one clumsily inserted clue about the nature of the antagonist. To be honest, I don't think this is a very good example of Mr. Stross's abilities as a writer. If it were longer he could have added more subtlety and mystery, but the very short length meant he had to pare the story down to it's absolute bare essentials. For me, the long setup and short conclusion threw the balance and cadence way off. A crucial read for fans of the Laundry Files series, but not recommended for people who aren't already familiar with the series."}, {"userName": "Jules Jones", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10074986-jules-jones", "userReview": "Cthulhu Christmas-themed novelette set in the Laundryverse, a couple of books into the series timeline. There's just about enough backstory that I think someone completely new to the Laundryverse could enjoy this, but you'll get a lot more fun out of it if you already know at least a little about the world it's set in. Bob Howard works for a branch of the British secret service which is devoted to putting off for as long as possible the forthcoming invasion of our universe by the eldritch horrors from beyond time and space. Except it's still the civil service, with all that implies about audit trails and HR...Being confined to a hospital bed by your last field assignment is no excuse for not putting in your annual leave request on time, so Bob's left minding the office phone over Christmas as Duty Officer. The upside is triple pay. The downside -- sometimes you have to earn that triple pay. It's Christmas Eve, and the Bringer of Gifts will be visiting all the boys and girls, even the ones at work. And especially the ones who work in the Laundry.Lovely satire of the office Christmas party and life in the civil service under austerity measures, with a large helping of geeky jokes, and good fun to read. It was a Hugo nominee for good reason.Originally published and still available as a free read at Tor.com, but also now available formatted as a cheap DRM-free ebook."}, {"userName": "John Cress", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149709-john-cress", "userReview": "This was a short story which was only a buck plus won an award so I figured why not. The preview also discussed the paranormal so I was a bit anxious to give it is try. However, this ended up being like one of those award winning movies that I would ask myself, 'how did that win?'. The story centers around an office for those hunting paranormal events. Santa ends up being one of these events. This sounds like a great premise but I found my mind wandering off and the story for what ever reason just didn't grab me. I can't quite figure out why but the 'it' factor just wasn't there.

I think the humour somewhat undermines the horror, which also seems too easily resolved.

Its based on the idea that Platos cavern idea is very realand if you do a lot of figures on the wall, you might get the attention of someone else whos looking from a different spot in the cave. The someone else is what we usually call demons.Since the cave is all about ideas, and the only pure language is math, then the best way to make shadow bunnies is by using math... and computers are, essentially, machines with the ability to do unearthly amounts of mathematical operations... So, basically? Your local friendly IT support guy ends up being a sorceror and demonologist, and working for the Laundrythe secret agency under Her Majesty to keep people safe from things that go bump on the day.This story plays with the idea that the human brain is, in truth, the most complex computer of them all. So, when a lot of humans think about the same thing, and believe in the same thing... The shadows on the wall are going to be BIG. Big enough to bring something over to our reality from the someone elses world.Something that crawls down chimneys on Christmas Eve.Bob is right out of medical leave, hes working overtime, and it has been prophesised by the Forecast Division that the end of the world is near. Whats a guy to do, except fetch his stocking and pray that the thing with tentacles finds the pastries before it finds him?This new instalment is short and funny. It didnt made me laugh out loud, like previous stories in the series have, but it was a delicious twist on a very seasonal tradition. I think youd probably be better off starting somewhere else in the series, but stillI love every single one of the Laundry titles."}, {"userName": "R.C.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4129722-r-c", "userReview": "I was pleasantly surprised by this short story. The first few pages are kind of difficult to get through because the narrator (1st person, main character) is wry, sardonic, and has a tendency to make many asides--basically, your quintessential Brit. But given the length of the story, I plowed forward and was rewarded.The characters, or at least the setting, are from a series done by the author. If I had read those books beforehand, I would have caught on a bit quicker as to what was going on. That being said, everything is laid out quite nicely and the story stands alone. I enjoyed the wry humor and found the whole evil twist on the Christmas/Nordic lore of Santa Claus hilarious.My only complaint is the way the first two-thirds of the story is presented; it jumps back and forth from present to past to present. While it worked, I felt that the tension that was building up in the present was a shell of what could have been, had it not been interrupted so often by the Ghost of Christmas Party's past. I may have to go and read the 2 books in Stross' The Laundry series now, if this story is but a brief example of the prose and humor of those books."}, {"userName": "Wayne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3977252-wayne", "userReview": "Ha! Kinda funny how things work out. A yuletide tale for the impending yuletide season. As dark and twisted as the story was, I cannot honestly say it scares me more than this time of year in general.

Yeah, the holiday season is the bane of the self employed. No extended paid vacation time for me. I dearly miss those full time employed days. Anyway, when did a book review become all about me? Oh yeah, when I started writing it. Its implicit in the contract signed by readers of my reviews. Read between the lines if the chance arises, dear reader.
