But honestly this book is about so much more than a kidnapping. Obviously that is a huge part of it, but it's very different from any other kidnapping story I have read. Right off we know who did it. But we also see how everyone is affected by it. We see time passing and how everyone tries to cope. It is about a kidnapping, but it\u2019s also about the power of a mother's love, loss, anger, forgiveness and so much more.We first meet Lucy Wakefield. Lucy tells us she can\u2019t tell her story straight. She has to tell it in circles, like rings of a tree that signify the passage of time.Lucy starts by saying how badly she wanted a child. She is very successful in business but what she wants most is a child. She is devastated that she\u2019s been unable to conceive a child after years of trying both naturally and with medical help. When having a child consumes all of her thoughts and time, her husband eventually leaves her. She knows that her chances of adopting as a single mother are very slim. On one of her frequent trips to IKEA she makes a split second decision that will change her life and the lives of so many others.Marilyn has relived the worst day of her live over and over. She remembers that she overslept that day. She remembers that the babysitter had to cancel and she was anxious as she was supposed to deliver a report at work that afternoon.\u201cWithout a babysitter, I was in trouble or so I thought, then unaware of what real trouble was.\u201dI can\u2019t even imagine going through something like this.I loved that the chapters were labeled clearly as there were many points of view. It just made the alternating perspectives of Mia, Lucy, Marilyn and so many others involved easier to keep up with. An easy read in regards to the way it was written. But it was also emotional, heartbreaking and devastating. I felt so many different emotions while reading this powerful book! The characters were all so well-defined. The passing of time and how differently people adapted to what had happened. As much as I wanted to see what was going to happen next, I was still enjoying everything I was reading. I learned a lot about meditation and yoga, the reunification process, China and Chinese culture and more.I felt the ending was a bit open to interpretation, but I was okay with that. I can\u2019t even imagine how hard it was to try to write an ending to a story like this.An engrossing read that I highly recommend!!"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "I've read books that have left me bawling - others I've laughed so hard that I was rolling on the floor. Others where I didn't like the characters at all, but thought the story was brilliant.In this *impossible-story-to-forget*, I felt INTENSE ANGER towards a character more than I can ever remember experiencing. I can't say enough high praise for author Helen Klein Ross in the way she wrote this book. ( the roller coaster emotions & thoughts she pulled out of us readers). If there was a voting award category for BEST BOOK CLUB pick for readers to vote, \"What Was Mine\" would make not only make the list ... but could win the grand award. There are many things I'd like to share in this review - yet almost anything I do, becomes a spoiler. So..... instead of a normal 'review'... ( 5 stars from me)...I'll share one detail: \"A Baby is Kidnapped and raised by the single woman who took her for 20 years\". ( but you may have already read that). Oh well! :)As for the rest of this review, I will share directly to a few of the characters.LUCY: Here is what I have to say to you > what you did from the moment you kidnapped a baby was WRONG... wrong ... wrong ... ( we all know that)....However, I didn't 'directly FEEL \"intense anger\" towards you until one morning when you went for a swim when in China. I HATED you when you said \"the water made you feel calmer\". I was pissed at you for feeling annoyed that you had to share the public pool with another swimmer. I wanted to kill you in that moment. Oh, I was soooo MAD at you!!!!! And yes.... ( at times), I even felt compassion towards you too. WE CAN THANK Our VERY TALENTED AUTHOR!!! CHERYL: We need to have a conversation - sister!!! You said something that I will continue to think about long after having read this book. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID... ( we can debate pros and cons later)... let's not give anything away to our readers, though. ( they can read this themselves). Other readers might debate with later too. MIA: I'm soooooo sorry sweetheart!!!!TOM: Do you realize you were somewhat of a turd?? If you have doubts..I'm happy to set you straight!MARILYN: What can I possibly say? OH MY GOD, my heart broke for you!!!I was also very moved and inspired of the difference Yoga, meditation and a vegan diet added to your life. Your years of getting support - practicing forgiveness -was realistic and incredible. You became my hero. Thank you..I'm sincerely moved. MOTHERS ... [MOTHER TO MOTHER], CUT IT OUT!!!! Stop comparing who is a better mother by who cooks more - who is a stay at home mother - or a working mother. STOP THE MOTHER WARS! ( daughters might take a lesson too). \"What Was Mine\", was more addicting than M&M's!!!!Thank you Gallery Books, Netgalley, and Helen Klein Ross"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "This book about a baby kidnapping has me all tied up in knots. First, there\u2019s the tone throughout the whole story. I would call it almost perky. Tell me, truthfully, how do the words \u201cperky\u201d and \u201ckidnap\u201d go together in any universe? Okay, if I take it down a notch and just call it \u201ccalm,\u201d it\u2019s still majorly weird. The initial abduction, of course, is high drama, but there\u2019s also this eerie calm encasing it. I can\u2019t decide if I liked the calm or not, but I had to keep reading, even though I was tired and hungry. Since calm didn\u2019t go with the deed, I felt all off kilter, but then I remembered that sometimes a calm sociopath does throw you for a loop.But what really really has me all unchy is the ending. I hated it. And the bad part is, I can\u2019t talk about it in this review because it would be one big spoiler. It\u2019s times like this I wish I belonged to a book group that picked this book as its next read. I want to empathically voice my feelings on the damn ending, which just seemed all wrong. It really has me thinking about loss and love, crime and punishment, attachment and detachment, belonging and not belonging. Is the ending realistic? I\u2019m hoping it isn\u2019t, but I fear it is. And this is what messes with my head. Does the author really believe the ending is what should have happened, or is she just trying to stir it up? I prefer to think it\u2019s the latter. I felt this pressure to agree with the ending, which was disturbing as hell. When I think of the ending, two words come to mind: church and PC. I cannot say any more.The baby was abducted from IKEA. (I'm guessing the writer had to get permission to use their name?) The abduction scene is so well written, I could just see the aisle where the baby was taken from. I\u2019m certain that I\u2019ll never be at IKEA again without thinking of this book, and I\u2019ll no doubt be on the lookout for unattended kids and potential kidnappers. I hope no one catches me doing my pretend PI bit. The story is told from different points of view (which worked great), and the main narrator is the abductor herself. This by itself makes the book unusual and fun\u2014how often is the villain also the storyteller? We also hear from the birth mother and from the abducted child (when grown up), and this adds complexity and excitement to the story. The characters at times felt a little flat (it\u2019s that \u201ctoo calm\u201d thing again), but I still found them interesting.There were a couple of coincidences that I just didn\u2019t buy. And I\u2019m not big on premonitions (as a plot device, they often seem like cheating to me). There was a premonition in this book that bugged me; it seemed like the author was trying to cover up for a far-fetched coincidence. Luckily, the premonition wasn\u2019t given a lot of air time.I don\u2019t often read psychological thrillers, and there are only a few that are favorites (We Need to Talk About Kevin, Gone Girl, The Dinner). Though I don\u2019t think What Was Mine is as good as these gems, it nonetheless burrowed into my skin like a chigger.This offbeat and well-written psychological study of motherhood was a clear 4-star book until I hit the messed-up ending. And then I was all No, No, No! So 3 stars it is, though they\u2019re shining pretty bright.I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t forget this book, mostly because the ending wound me up so much. Please read this. Then we can pretend we\u2019re in a book club, and even if you love the ending, we can go cuckoo over it together."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "4.5 StarsAs the beautiful song goes by Jamie Lawson I \"Wasn't Expecting That \".\"Lucy Wakefield is a seemingly ordinary woman who does something extraordinary in a desperate moment.

This was a book that had my thoughts and emotions all over the place. The plot was imaginative, characters were well developed and pacing was excellent. The story is told from the alternating perspectives of Lucy, Mia, Mia's birth mother and others intimately involved in the lives of this family.Really enjoyed this book and the narration was excellent."}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "Yikes! What Was Mine is so creepy -- every parent's worst nightmare. And yet I can't quite believe how much I enjoyed reading this book -- it is so well done. On impulse, desperate for a child, Lucy kidnaps Marilyn's baby from an IKEA store when the baby is 4 months old. She renames the baby Mia and goes on to raise the baby as her own, appearing to the world as the single mother of an adopted child. The kidnapping happens in the early 1990s. The story is alternatingly told from the perspectives of Lucy, Marilyn and a few other people affected by the kidnapping. They tell the story from today's vantage point, with the benefit of hindsight, slowly revealing what happened in the years following the kidnapping. Lucy is completely deadpan in her self-justification for what she did, and her satisfaction that she has done a good job raising Marilyn's daughter -- with occasional flashes of insight at the craziness of what she did and the pain she must have caused Marilyn. In contrast, Marilyn falls apart and later as best she can puts the pieces back together -- but, again, with the benefit of time she tells her story in a matter of fact way. It's well written, it's clever, it's chilling, and it made me want to rush to the end to figure whether and how Lucy's deception comes crashing down. And the end was certainly interesting, although it definitely won't be satisfying to everyone. No more said to avoid spoilers. This a book with absolutely no violence but that had my stomach in knots and my shoulders up to my ears. Very well done, harrowing and so clever. Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for an opportunity to read an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Maxine (Booklover Catlady)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22943325-maxine-booklover-catlady", "userReview": "Imagine this...you turn your back on your baby left in a shopping trolley to take a phone call from your workplace, you are distracted for minutes, but you will regret those minutes for the rest of your life. Your baby has been taken...Every mothers nightmare right? Just can't imagine the sheer terror that would turn your blood cold. This book tackles that very scenario and does it in a highly engaging and readable way. A book you won't forget in a hurry.Lucy Wakefield is a seemingly ordinary woman who does something extraordinary in a desperate moment: she takes a baby girl from a shopping cart and raises her as her own. It\u2019s a secret she manages to keep for over two decades\u2014from her daughter, the babysitter who helped raise her, family, coworkers, and friends.When Lucy\u2019s now-grown daughter Mia discovers the devastating truth of her origins, she is overwhelmed by confusion and anger and determines not to speak again to the mother who raised her. She reaches out to her birth mother for a tearful reunion, and Lucy is forced to flee to China to avoid prosecution. What follows is a ripple effect that alters the lives of many and challenges our understanding of the very meaning of motherhood.Is Lucy a bad person? You really have to come to your own conclusions on that. The book doesn't let things be very clear cut from the start, the scary thing is she gets away with raising her newly \"adopted\" daughter for 21 years! Yes, 21 years...With changing viewpoints and voices the book explores so many different issues around what motherhood is and isn't and it is fascinating (if not somewhat difficult) to read the roll-out impact over the years on Lucy, Mia and the birth mother. Did she do the wrong thing by putting an urgent phone call over keeping an eye on her baby? Did she deserve to feel guilty and beat herself up? Does it make a difference how the abductor (Lucy) raises the stolen baby? Does it matter if she is brought up well or not? As the book steams forward to the reconnection of Mia with her birth mother you will no doubt go through a fair few thoughts and feelings around this book. Quite incredible to find out your daughter is alive and well no doubt 21 years on! The ways this impacts on the new family and everyone is just something that needs to be read for yourself. Does nurture or nature prevail? This is a great read that I think many will enjoy, this one gets 4 happy reading stars from me. Enjoy!I received a copy of this book thanks to the publisher via NetGalley, many thanks."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "What Was Mine*WARNING MY REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*When my firstborn son was only 14 months old I allowed him to stay with his paternal grandparents for almost a month. That meant he had to travel fifteen hundred miles away from me all the way from South Florida to Boston.Up to that point, we had never been apart, not even for a day and though rationally I knew he was safe and well taken care of, I can still recall the apprehension, unease and sense of emptiness I felt during those weeks.What were my biggest fears? Did he feel I had abandoned him? Would he recognize me when he saw me? How long would it take for a one year-old to forget his mom's face?Of course I realize there's not comparison between my experience and what happens in this story, but for some reason reading it triggered those memories and gave me a sense of the pain and horror one must experience when losing your child in any way, but especially in the dramatic, horrifying fashion described in this novel.What Was Mine is an engrossing novel, at times absorbing and agonizing but also deeply moving and though-provoking.I appreciated Helen Klein Ross ability to create characters that were rich and morally complex, not an easy task considering the disturbing nature of this story.As readers our sympathies lie mostly with the two main characters, Mia and Marilyn and with their extended families, but I thought Lucy was a very well-developed, complex protagonist, maybe we should agree to call her our quasi-villain?We certainly get to know Lucy better than any of the other characters and although I (mostly) hated her for what she did, I was also able to understand the motivations behind her unconscious actions.I found Mia to be a somewhat one-dimensional character, especially considering the pivotal role she played in the story, I still didn't seem to get a full sense of her relationships with Lucy and her aunt. In a way Mia's connection to Wendy, her loving Chinese nanny, is more accurately described than the one she had with her own secretive mother. Marilyn's voice felt very authentic and sensibly narrated but I would've liked to get to know her a little better. Her divorce and subsequent decision to start a new life in California made perfect sense to me.And although Wendy was a minor character I thought she was very well drawn and her sense of decency and personal story touched me deeply.The chapters set in China were particularly engrossing, very interesting to see that culture juxtaposed and compared to ours especially within the frame of this story. The descriptions of how China's one-child policy affected the lives of Wendy and her family served to highlight our very profound differences but also our undeniable similarities. And I appreciated the respect Helen Klein Ross showed for the Chinese people and their culture at large.It was also extremely fascinating to see how 20 years of advances in science and technology, the Internet and the interconnectivity we now enjoy has created such contrasting paradigms in the ways we live, all within a relative short period of time. I am sure kids are still kidnap, but with the ubiquitous presence of smartphones and cameras everywhere, would it be so easy for a stranger to take a baby from a public place in a largely populated area and get away with it? Somehow I doubt it.A couple of things that really bothered me, first, what kind of father after 21 years of absence doesn't run home to hug his long lost child the VERY moment she's found??? I don't care that he was overseas, had another wife, whatever, I couldn't believe how nonchalant and detached he was.There were also a few instances when the kidnapping of baby Natalie was referred to as a \"mistake\". No matter how charitable one want to be, there's not way to look at this act, as unpremeditated as it was and describe it as anything but a senseless, unconscious crime. And so I am left wondering, would I be able to forgive a woman that so selfishly and callously kidnapped my baby and then shows not remorse or regret for the harm she caused? Honestly I am not sure, I'd like to think I would but is probably easier to believe in forgiveness and reconciliation as abstract concepts than to put them in practice under such appalling circumstances.A good and very wise friend told me the other day \"In the end nothing is not worth forgiving\", granted this friend is way more enlightened than me, but I agree with her that finding mercy and forgiveness is a goal very much worth pursuing, not matter how wronged you'd been. Now the question of whether or not Lucy should have served time in jail is a whole other issue...The conclusion to What Was Mine felt a tad abrupt but I am one that prefers an ambiguous, inconclusive finish to an elaborated, neatly-wrap ending that feels too perfect and unauthentic.I listened to the audio version of this book which was very well narrated by a multicast. Fiction doesn't always work on audio but this one did for me. So if you are able to moderately suspend disbelief and looking for a riveting, intense story, I highly recommend this one.And I have to say, I drive by an IKEA on my way to work every day. I'll probably never look at that store in the same way, that's for sure."}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "5 well deserved stars!

It was that good.The story was told in alternating perspectives of Lucy, Mia, and Marilyn as well as a few others that had some impact connected to the kidnapping.

While the heat of that emotion dimmed some after getting to know her better, I never could reconcile how one woman can decide her pain means more than another woman's. How can your desire for a child make it okay to take someone else's baby who's obviously cared for and loved?This story wrecked me as we're given extraordinary insight into the wide-ranging impact of a baby abduction, short and long term.

There's not much that's predictable here and some really important themes run rampant...motherhood, grief, forgiveness, family, loyalty, justice.

This story is fascinating and provocative, ideal for book clubs and online group discussions. I'm encouraging my friends to read it now so I can talk about it...NOW!

Lucy and her husband had gotten pregnant when they were in college together, but they felt that it just wasn't the right time to start a family. Needless to say, the decision was made for them when Lucy lost the baby. Lucy prayed that the chance to have a baby would come again. Years later, Lucy and her husband kept trying and failing to have a baby. Lucy tried IVF, but to no avail, nothing worked. A friend of Lucy's told her, \"if you visualize it, it will come,\" and so Lucy set up a nursery in their home.

The book is engaging and highly readable. I zoomed through the pages in just a couple of days wanting to know what might happen next. What makes this unique, is the depth of the characters.

In particular, I loved the slow transformation of Marilyn from harried first-time mom in NJ, to a wisened CA earthy mother. 3.5 stars rounded up.Thank you to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for a galley of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jamise // Spines & Vines", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13111928-jamise-spines-vines", "userReview": "Rating 4.5 Excellent read, a definite page turner! In efforts not to spoil the book for other readers, What Was Mine gave me just the amount of crazy and WTH's that I enjoy when reading a book of this nature. Although the subject matter is any parents worst nightmare, I thoroughly enjoyed how the author somehow made me as a reader feel empathy for Lucy. At times I was angry with Marilyn but I also felt sorry for her. My emotions were all over the place which is the recipe for a good read for me. The only thing that kept my rating from being 5 stars is that I did not like the way the book ended. I wanted more!! On the up side maybe there will be a sequel because this story can definitely evolve!"}, {"userName": "Poppy fairy ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18322003-poppy-fairy", "userReview": "My review is on www.ireadnovels.wordpress.com100% an excellent page turner. Lucy Wakefield takes a baby girl from a shopping cart in IKEA. She takes the baby home and keeps the baby girl by changing the baby's name to Mia. One fatal day Mia in her twenties discovers that she was stolen as a baby and is reunited with her real birth mother. But who will Mia think as her mum?

As a parent, I would never wish upon any parent to go through the trauma that Tom and Marilyn endured. The loss/kidnapping of an infant (or any child) is every parent's nightmare. To have that child stolen from you and be raised by another - a horrible and most despicable act. I think that what struck me with this book is the fact that the kidnapper Lucy justified her crime using all sorts of excuses. The baby's mother was neglectful and left the child alone in a shopping cart, the child reacted to her, etc. But nowhere did she think of the child's best interests - only her yearning for a baby. Lucy was a good caregiver; baby Mia did not lack for anything. Lucy told her sister and co-workers that she adopted Mia from a teenage mom from Kansas. She rarely saw her own family and did not have many friends from outside work. Lies do have a way of catching up and Marilyn learns of Mia's existence. She establishes contact and Mia learns about Lucy's deception. Lucy leaves the country on a business trip to China (no extradition laws). Mia goes to San Mateo to be with her birth mother's family.This book raises all sorts of ethical issues. While Lucy committed a most heinous crime, could Mia put her in prison for life? What about restitution for Mia's birth parents? How does one integrate a \"lost\" child back into a family? Mia's birth mother Marilyn was a little too \"granola\" for me, focusing on chi, astrology, and yoga (not that there is anything wrong with those things, lol). I do have one criticism of the book. The ending is way too abrupt. I would have liked to have seen more closure for all involved. Thank you to NetGalley and Gallery, Threshold, Pocket Books for a review copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Carole", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630646-carole", "userReview": "It was hard to choose between 4-5 stars for this one. I turned the pages quickly, engrossed in the story told from the perspectives of Mia, Lucy & Marilyn. Baby Natalie is taken from her Mother's shopping cart and raised lovingly by Lucy. It was strange that I could empathize with Lucy even though she kidnapped Natalie. I was interested to read this book, as this could have been my story as a toddler. My parents had taken me Christmas shopping when I was 18 months old. My Mom let me out of the cart to see what toys I might like. She turned to attend to my baby brother, and I toddled around the corner of the aisle. When she realized I wasn't near, she and my Dad frantically searched for me. My Mom saw a woman running for the front doors of the store with me in her arms. Thankfully my Mom caught up to her, and grabbed me from her. My Mom left her cart full of presents, and she said she couldn't even begin to indentify the woman, she was so rattled by the attempted abduction.My favorite quote from this book is \"When you forgive, the prisoner you set free is yourself\" this is a story of forgivenes, and one I recommend.

What Was Mine had me up and reading at 4am. As a parent, reading a book about a baby\u2019s kidnapping is always unsettling. Most of us have experienced at least one brief moment of terror when our eyes weren\u2019t quick enough in their search for our children. Most of us are lucky enough to have feeling quickly replaced by an overwhelming sense of relief when, in short order, we realize he/she had been right there all along, just an arm\u2019s length away. Marilyn was not that lucky.Lucy had been trying for a baby for quite a while when she was married. Now she has a bit of an obsession with Ikea. There she finds a baby whose mother has turned her back for just a few seconds too many. She kidnaps said baby but deludes herself into thinking that at some point soon she\u2019ll find a way to return her. She\u2019s in denial of her actions and the severity of the consequences which I found to be a little infuriating. She is a woman we would expect to know better \u2013 professional, no other implied behavioral health issues or criminal tendencies\u2026 She raises Mia as her own for 21 years until Lucy learns the truth through a series of serendipitous coincidences and events.One thing I loved about this book is that it\u2019s not meant to be a mystery. There\u2019s no whodunnit. We know right out the gate what\u2019s happened. What we don\u2019t know is where it leaves everyone in their relationships. Will Marilyn be able to forgive Lucy? Could she ever accept that Mia may feel anything other than hatred toward Lucy? Will Mia ever feel as though she belongs with her birth family? Can her siblings accept her? Will Mia ever be able to feel secure in her sense of identity? The author really gets to the heart of the matter by telling us the story through the eyes of many of the characters including Lucy, Marilyn, Mia, Lucy\u2019s sister, Mia\u2019s nanny, and others. The pieces of the puzzle put themselves together perfectly through these narratives.The only thing that prevents me from giving this book 5 stars is the ending. It was rather abrupt and didn\u2019t give me a sense of being fully complete. I would be surprised if this book doesn\u2019t become a very popular read, even a best-seller in 2016.My rating: 4.5 stars (Rounded up here as Goodreads doesn't allow for 1/2 stars.)Many thanks to Gallery books via NetGalley for providing me with a free ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review. www.litwitwineanddine.com"}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "It sucked you up into the story and obsession immediately. And uses the current switching narrator method within tiny chapters that is so much the rage. It works here. The tension is high.And yet I am appalled overall at my own reaction. Because during the first 3/4ths of the novel I was invested to motives, feelings, rationalizations, movements to obscure locations by relocating etc.Why? I really don't know why. Possibly because the 3 main woman characters seemed like \"nice\" ladies?What I do know is that this book makes a credible case for stealing a baby out of an IKEA while the baby's biological mother is shopping and distracted. With 21 more years to follow for reasons not to bring her back.This is chick lit. that is skillful. Skillful enough to make the anguish for the bereft parents become secondary to the emotional connections to the kidnapper for the reader. Why am I not surprised at the seemingly forgivable justification for obtaining her centrally perceived need? It happens all the time when people cross laws to get what they think they deserve and need. But I still am shocked at how people, mostly women themselves, perceive this book. All methods of other peoples' noses being the limit of my own swinging fist being part of my heritage and essential makeup, I guess. I wonder how they would feel if someone never returned their baby until they were an adult. This will sell, I'm sure. The writing pulled you in and that is why I gave it 3 stars. But I don't think I would read any more by this author. I'm sure I won't. The more I think about this one, the sicker it is. By not acting or behaving to be sick in its reality, but instead by heralding as core the meek and cuddly perpetrator supreme. Yes, it's very sick. And sicker yet, for being sick disguised.And the ending! Repulsive. 2.5 stars and I should have rounded it down."}, {"userName": " Li'l Owl ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48372551-li-l-owl", "userReview": "One woman, Lucy, is devastated to learn she is unable to have a baby. She is consumed to the point of insanity, if only for a moment. One women, Marilyn, has a baby. She has taken her for granted, if only for a moment. One little girl, Mia/Natalie caught in between. Leading to the consequences left in the wake of that one moment. This is a very good book all in all. The beginning is well done, going back and forth between the lives of Lucy and Marilyn after that one fateful moment in time following the abduction of baby girl, Mia/Natalie. The middle was filled out nicely with Lucy and Mia living a seemingly normal life together. The pace is fast and full of suspense and I nearly read it in one sitting.Unfortunately, the ending was very disappointing. All three of the moving parts of the story come together with a solid start to the conclusion of the book. The realization and truth of Lucy's secret comes to light. Mia discovers that her life with her mom, Lucy, is not what it seemed. And Marilyn finally gets her wish that her baby girl returns to her, even if it's after she's all grown up. The ending was very disappointing for me, which is a shame because the book had such promise!

Good can come from an unimaginable event, without denying the horror of the crime, and this book shows that. I was satisfied with the ending, not only because it was open ended, but because I could understand Mia's decision - she was doing to the best of her ability what she thought was best.Ironically, however, Mia was the hardest one I found to connect with. I just couldn't grasp her voice - she definitely sounded younger than 21, which contributed to her one-dimensional nature.

What if you did something that you knew was wrong, but you couldn't go back and undo it? What if you knew that what you were doing would haunt you for the rest of your life, but you chose to follow through and do it anyways?Helen Klein Ross covers all of these dilemmas and more in her new novel, What Was Mine, which is set to be released on January 5, 2016.What Was Mine is the story Lucy, of a recently divorced woman who wants only to be able to have a child. Unable to now fulfill this dream on her own, she finds herself searching for ways in which to get a baby - but she never in her wildest dreams suspected that she might steal one and raise it as her own. Now, more than 2 decades after \"the incident,\" Lucy must face the fact that her daughter has learned the truth about her childhood. As her world starts crumbling down around her, Lucy must decide what's important and what it truly means to be a family.WOW OH WOW, it's been a while since I got so engrossed in a book. Heck, I even finished this one midday because I couldn't wait to finish my work in order to read it. It REALLY IS that good. All of these books are coming out these days claiming to be \"the next Gone Girl,\" but let's be real, there's only one real Gone Girl. However, this is the closest I have read to that style of book and I was certainly not disappointed.I personally loved the way this book was written from seemingly everyone's perspective. It jumps around a bit on the timeline to give some different perspectives and insight, but it was never once confusing and every character had a very distinct voice that only helped to add to the drama and suspense. I hate books that have a clear good-guy vs. bad-guy theme and this book is perfect in that the \"good-guy\" isn't always good and the \"bad-guy\" is often the most likable. If a book can keep me guessing until the final page, I am going to be a fan.If you are a parent, loved Gone Girl so much that you've been on the quest for the next best thing, or you just want to indulge yourself in a really, really good book - I couldn't recommend Ross's What Was Mine more.What Was Mine goes on sale on January 5, 2016 so be sure to preorder your copy today so that you can start reading it the moment it's released!My rating of What Was Mine: \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 (I was provided with a free copy of this book in order to conduct this review.)WEBSITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM"}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "A special thank you to Gallery Books and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

An abduction. A Kidnapping. I loved everything about this book! What happens in a split-second;  a decision, based on desperation, need, want, and obsession. Two women. Both professionals. A distraction. One baby. Someone loses. Someone gains. However, a thought-provoking question: For one woman: Are you prepared to live with your choices? For another woman: Can you truly get ever back What Was Mine and Lost? A baby. A daughter. Caught in the middle of two worlds. Lucy is married,  a successful career in the ad world, and wants a baby. After unsuccessful attempts, infertility drugs, and years of trying, nothing seems to be working. Her husband is tired of her obsession and leaves. She wants a baby. So she tries visualizing, by setting up an entire nursery. She goes to her local IKEA NJ store and sees a baby in a cart. A four-month-old beautiful baby. It seems to be unattended. This may be a sign. A baby for her to rescue. She will pick it up just for a moment. However, the one moment turns into, walking out the door with a baby. In the car, she is overwhelmed with what she has just done.Too late to take back the baby,  she falls in love. She will keep the baby for her own. She gets away with it for twenty years, changing the name, watching the news over the years, and even finding out the identity of the real mother. She keeps to herself and tells everyone she has adopted the baby. She hires a wonderful nanny from China to help take care of daughter, Mia which has a big impact on her life through adulthood. (clever tie in here) As a single professional, Lucy offers her daughter, Mia the best of art, education, and culture. She does not date or has friends\u2014her world revolves around her daughter.The biological mother  (Marilyn) is guilt-ridden, having walked away from the cart on a phone call for work for a minute. Her marriage is destroyed, and she will never get over losing her daughter. Even when she moves, remarries and has another family. This story is told from the alternating perspectives of Lucy Wakefield (the woman who raises someone else's baby as her own), Mia (the former baby), Mia\u2019s birth mother, Marilyn. Now, the juicy part  (which I thought was a brilliant and clever twist by the author). Lucy is a ghost writer for a book and wants more. She wants her name on the book with the co-author. Greed gets in the way of her perfect life. It turns out to be devastating for her in the end. At the book signing, I was on pins and needles--suspense, intensity. Author\u2019s lives are not so private, especially when a thriller book is written about a baby snatching, and the real mother reads it. The biological mother reads all books about baby kidnapping, trying to find out why this happened to her. Of course, there is social media and Facebook. From this part, one reader will be glued to this page-turner! All the secrets come out in the open, leaving behind a pile of devastation. We hear from different perspectives: Lucy, the biological mother, Marilyn, and later from the daughter when she is grown. A twist with China, the nanny, and the ending was perfect. I could almost see a sequel, to continue with Lucy, Mia, and Marilyn. (especially Lucy) The author does an outstanding job of keeping things neutral, allowing readers to form their own opinions. You almost feel sympathy for Lucy at times, as well as Mia, and of course Marilyn. Two different women at the end; however, early on, they were similar in many ways. How different Mia's life would have been if raised by the biological mother. What makes WHAT WAS MINE  so spectacular: \u2022\tPresentation/Marketing:  Ross\u2019 website.

It\u2019s a secret she manages to keep for over two decades\u2014from her daughter, the babysitter who helped raise her, family, coworkers, and friends.When Lucy\u2019s now-grown daughter Mia discovers the devastating truth of her origins, she is overwhelmed by confusion and anger and determines not to speak again to the mother who raised her. She reaches out to her birth mother for a tearful reunion, and Lucy is forced to flee to China to avoid prosecution. What follows is a ripple effect that alters the lives of many and challenges our understanding of the very meaning of motherhood.Author Helen Klein Ross, whose work has appeared in The New Yorker, weaves a powerful story of upheaval and resilience told from the alternating perspectives of Lucy, Mia, Mia\u2019s birth mother, and others intimately involved in the kidnapping.
