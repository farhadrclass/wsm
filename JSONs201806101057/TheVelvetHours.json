I knew I just had to read this novel. Marthe de Florian was a courtesan who amassed a life of riches and wealth. Her apartment when discovered in 2010 and had remained untouched for seven decades revealed a wealth of antiques including a magnificent painting of her by the well known artist Gioanni Boldini. The author Alyson Richman with her wonderful flair for writing fills in the unknowns of Marthe De Florian's story and presents us with a wonderful novel of historical fiction which is lyrical and moving. A truly beautiful piece of writing where the prose flows and the characters are well developed. A wonderful sense of time and place and each time I picked up this novel I found myself transported to this beautiful Paris apartment and enjoyed the vivid images painted by the author of the antiques and paintings. The book tells the story of the Marthe De Florian and her rags to riches story and her niece whom she allows into her life just before the onset of World War one.I can only describe this novel as a quiet sensual and graceful novel with a quiet and yet interesting plot that spans from the late 1800s through to the start of the Second World War. There is romance which I am not a major fan of in historical fiction but it is well written and works in this novel. I found myself constantly googling , painters and places mentioned in the book and while this is historical fiction and the author tale is rich and imagined using the apartment in Paris as its background for the story it had me completely drawn in and intrigued from start to finish and enjoyed every moment spent with this book."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Marthe de Florian, though this was not always her name, was born into poverty, at an early age she witnessed the death of her younger sister, Odile, something she never forget. She raised herself up, using the gifts available to her, beauty and charm. She was the mistress of a wealthy man and came to be beloved by a famous painter. Two stories, her granddaughter Solange, only meets her when she is nineteen. Marthe tells Solange the story of her life and a tight bond is formed between them. The Germans are advancing on Paris, and soon escape will be impossible. But, the past provides for the present at times and so it proves true in this story.The prose when storytelling or descriptive is elegant and seductive. Fill of beauty and charm. The story compelling, especially since it is based on a real person. Occasionally I did find the dialogue clunky and over sentimental, but all in all the author did a fabulous job.The author acknowledges that little is known about Marthe but she does a wonderful job filling in and creating her story. It all rings true, could have happened just this way. Such a wonderful blend of the historical and the personal. Her apartment was left untouched for seventy years and only opened in 2010, just the mystery of that alone was compelling. Here is a link which includes pictures of what was found, I find them haunting, yet beautiful. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/artic...

Marthe, the estranged grandmother, shares her life story with her granddaughter Solange in 1940. The book alternates between the current life of Solange and the past life of Marthe. Solange\u2019s life is just beginning while Marthe\u2019s is near the end. The short merging of their two lives forms the fabric of the story.I loved Marthe\u2019s story and while I was reading the book I wanted to understand how she became estranged from her son? How did she survive all these years on her own? How did she end up living in this great apartment? I wanted the answers, and this got me hooked into the book. The story also involved the lives of Solange\u2019s family and friends facing German occupation and the impact on all their lives.I don\u2019t want to give away too much of the story but it was well executed and enjoyable. I am looking forward to more novels from Alyson Richman. I was sad when I finished the book.Paperback is now 6.29 on Amazon - cheaper than kindle version - https://www.facebook.com/suzyapproved...- not sure for how long!"}, {"userName": "PorshaJo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo", "userReview": "A few years ago, a Paris apartment was opened after having lain untouched for seven decades. It was discovered after its owner died aged 91. Upon viewing the apartment, it was like a time warp, where nothing was disturbed and it contained a large painting by the artist Boldini of a lovely French woman. Again, this little piece of history now becomes this novel.The author heard about this and weaved the story, The Velvet Hours. The story focuses on two women. The first, Marthe de Florian, a woman who cultivated a life of art and beauty, and lived as though time stood still. The second, her granddaughter, Solange, who is a writer and is intrigued by her grandmothers life story and wants to write a novel about her. Marthe meets her granddaughter and begins to tell her of how she grew up, obtained the apartment, and how she met Giovanni Boldini, who eventually painted her portrait. Marthe is quite the recluse who has built this world inside her apartment, and it does not seem to be impacted by the events going on in Paris. The Germans are approaching, making life a bit difficult, and scary for Solange, who is part Jewish. The book goes back and forth between the two women where you learn about each of them and how their lives turn out during this difficult time in history.I love books that pluck a piece of history and built an elaborate story around it. The Velvet Hours is a wonderful example of this. It is a slow moving story with just a tiny bit of romance. But a wonderful look at a different take on this time in history. I picked this up after reading Diane S's review and I'm glad that I did. It's quite the moving story."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I'll be honest, I started a review copy of this book assuming I would bail, but instead I got sucked in and halfway through before I even knew what was happening.The author was inspired by the time-capsule apartment that was only recently discovered, left behind in Paris at the start of World War II and only opened again when the owner's granddaughter died. The painting, the love letters, the details of the room, all inspired the author to write a fictionalized account of the woman and her life. She imagines her as a \"kept woman,\" creating a space where no war or conflict exists, where a lover can take three baths to prepare to see her man, and spend money on art and trinkets. She also imagines the granddaughter, who is in her early 20s when the war starts, and a secret of her heritage makes the situation more dire.

I remember being intrigued when the story of this \"time capsule\" apartment came out, and Alyson Richman did a beautiful job bringing it back to life.The heart of the story is a grandmother telling her newly-found granddaughter about her eccentric life. Marthe was a courtesan during the Belle \u00c9poque, and she rose from poverty to become the owner of this lavish apartment filled with amazing treasures. Her granddaughter, Solange, is a struggling young writer looking for inspiration, and definitely finds it in Marthe's tales.At times I thought the pacing was slow, a lot of time was spent describing things - paintings, ceramics, and such - but the story picked up when the threat of World War II was upon them. It was here that the characters were truly challenged, and Solange learns from her grandmother that sometimes sentimentality must be sacrificed for a greater purpose.THE VELVET HOURS is a rich story of history, romance, and survival, perfect for fans of late 19th/early 20th century fiction. 3.75 stars!Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "From 1898 to 1940 we meet Solange and Marthe de Florian.Solange is the granddaughter of Marthe and the grandmother Solange never knew existed until she was nineteen years old. Solange's father never knew Marthe was his birth mother until he was eighteen and kept Marthe from Solange until Solange's mother had passed away.The meeting of the two women allowed Solange to learn of her grandmother's life and legacy in an apartment filled with collected treasures and the traces of men Marthe had collected during her lifetime.I really enjoyed getting to know Marthe and Solange as Marthe told her life story to her granddaughter. What a treat it must have been for Solange to listen to the story. Marthe's life was one that went from poverty to living a luxurious life paid for by Charles and other men. THE VELVET HOURS was enticing, sensual, and exceptionally interesting since it was based on the real life of Marthe. \u200bI truly enjoyed the book and recommend THE VELVET HOURS for historical fiction fans. Ms. Richman's writing and research are absolutely marvelous.Don't forget to search for photos of Marthe's apartment and her famous portrait\u200b by \u200bartist, \u200bGiovanni Boldini. It is totally amazing to me how the apartment and its contents made it through WWII without being ransacked or destroyed and that no one entered it for 70 years.ENJOY when you read THE VELVET HOURS. \u200bI hope you fall in love with Marthe's story as I did. \u200b5/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "4.5 starsWhile I really liked the entire book a lot, the beginning and the ending were outstanding. The start of the book perfectly set the stage for the entire story, and the ending wrapped it up beautifully. The Velvet Hours focuses on the lives of two women: Marthe de Florian, a member of the demi-monde, whose story begins in the late 1800\u2019s and Solange, a young woman living in Paris during World War II. As the story unfolds, Solange learns she is related to Marthe and begins visiting her regularly. During these visits, Marthe relays the story of her intriguing life and the magnificent painting of Marthe that hangs in her spectacular Belle Epoque-era apartment. Alyson Richman\u2019s focus on detail really makes this book. Her in-depth descriptions of the fashions worn by Marthe, the collections of art accumulated by Marthe and even the apartment itself are incredible. The author clearly did her research, and her ability to so vividly depict the characters and the setting is just fabulous. As always, one of my favorite parts about historical fiction is learning more about the time period involved and placing people and culturally significant items from an era in their context. Richman focuses a lot on fashion and haute couture from the Belle Epoque era, and I enjoyed looking up and learning about some of the famous designers from this era in Paris such as the Callot Soeurs. She also threw in a reference to H.A. and Margret Rey, the creators of Curious George, who fled Europe during Hitler\u2019s reign. I have always loved Curious George and had no idea that the Reys had left Europe with so many others in the late 1930\u2019s and early 1940\u2019s. One of my other favorite parts about historical fiction is when an author includes an Author\u2019s Notes section with information relating to the genesis of the novel and information regarding the historical aspects of the novel. Richman includes a wonderfully detailed Author\u2019s Note regarding her inspiration for the novel (which is partially based on a true event), and the limited information she was able to find regarding the actual participants. I found that section absolutely fascinating. I highly recommend this novel.

Her latest novel, THE VELVET HOURS, both follows and elevates her pattern in what is her finest work to date.Reading the pages of THE VELVET HOURS is like leafing through old letters or lifting old garments and artifacts from a trunk. Each piece holds such fascination, such history, it is worth lingering to gather their essence. Richman deftly makes a global narrative set in two wars into an intimate rendering of family and society. Her description of physical objects grounds the reader in the pages, and makes for a consuming sensory experience.All of Richman\u2019s characters are complicated and human. It is difficult to make a courtesan into a noble figure, but Richman does just that, and it is this courtesan\u2013Marthe de Florian\u2013who is the pulsing heart of the work. My only complaint is that the book ended. The story that follows the story is worthy of a novel, and I hope Richman picks up where she left off to give the reader more.I feel as if I have been to the Parisian apartment-turned-time-capsule that inspired this novel, and I\u2019d like to linger.

It deals with war-torn France for at least part of the book, and having read and loved The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The author creates a rich setting and memorable characters. It is the story of two women, and is at least based partly on an actual apartment in Paris that was preserved for seventy years after the death of its inhabitant, Marthe de Florian. This novel tells the imagined tale of Marthe de Florian, a courtesan during the Belle Epoque era, and her granddaughter, Solange. The relationship between Marthe and Solange develops through the novel as Marthe relates her life story to Solange. This is center of the book, but Solange's life outside of her relationship with her grandmother also becomes a focus, as World War II commences and the Germans invade France.

you read a book and end up disappointed; other times, you might be satisfied, but not overly moved. Or you may have a good solid book that left you happy. When I finished reading The Velvet Hours, I was left feeling grateful to have read such an interesting, beautiful novel that I will never forget. The Velvet Hours behind with an ending, but why a furnished, loved home is abandoned is a mystery to be answered by going back to a beginning. Of Mathilde Beaugiron who became Marthe de Florian, and her granddaughter Solange, who spends time learning her grandmere's past, and her story is just stunning. I'm not quite sure if I loved Marthe, or if I just loved the way Richman wrote her story. It doesn't matter, though. I found her tale truly engrossing. Solange's part was interesting as well, particularly since she is a young woman in love, in 1940 Paris, on the brink of German occupation. Solange's story should have been more compelling than Marthe's, and to most it may be, but for me, Marthe owned my heart. I could not help comparing The Velvet Hours to The Nightingale. They're not really the same story \u2014not even close \u2014but the time period, the theme of family and devotion, and the location of WWII-era Paris should be enough to spark interest in those readers. The Velvet Hours deserves an audience. It is an intelligent, emotional, and lovely story I won't soon forget."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4364717-nancy", "userReview": "In The Velvet Hours, the story of courtesan Marthe de Florian is told through meetings with her granddaughter Solange in Marthe's finely appointed Paris apartment. We learn about Marthe and her Belle Epoque life in chapters that alternate with Solange's life in the World War II era. The writing is descriptive and tantalizing, and the story is interesting and moved along at a pace which allowed me to savor every word. An added interest to this story is the fact that Marthe and Solange were actual people and the apartment in all its finery was maintained until 2010. Readers of World War II historical fiction from a woman's perspective will enjoy this book.

I enjoyed it for awhile but Marthe's POV was not enjoyable for me. The book is told in 2 POV, Marthe and her granddaughter, Solange. I did enjoy reading about Solange, but being inside Marthe's head was annoying. I found her to be so shallow, haughty, and narcissistic. I put the book down several times, and almost DNF. But, I found myself wanting to find out what happened to Solange, so I carried on. The prose was good, even though I didn't enjoy one of the main characters.

I love how the author read an article about a mysterious Parisian apartment that had been discovered after 70 years and then based a historical fiction novel on the possible back story of the original owner of that apartment and her granddaughter. The story takes place from the Belle \u00c9poque period around 1898 to World War II in the 1940s. It's told from the perspective of the grandmother and her granddaughter. The grandmother was a courtesan so much of the book is sensual and feels very risqu\u00e9. A great piece of fiction for an escape mixed in with some history."}, {"userName": "Nirit", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22121328-nirit", "userReview": "\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d5\u05de\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd. \u05de\u05de\u05ea\u05e7 \u05dc\u05d7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05d4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9. \u05de\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2\u05e2 \u05e9\u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0, \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05ea\u05d5\u05db\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e2\u05d6\u05d5\u05d1.\u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e2 \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d6 \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d4\u05db\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d0\u05e6\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d6 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e1\u05d5\u05e3 \u05d4\u05de\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d4-19. \u05e1\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0\u05e0\u05d6' \u05e9\u05dc\u05d0 \u05de\u05de\u05d6\u05de\u05df \u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d0\u05de\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e4\u05d2\u05e9\u05ea \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd \u05e1\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4 \u05de\u05e6\u05d3 \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4, \u05d5\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e2\u05ea \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e1\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4. \u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05d1\u05d9\u05dc, \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05ea \u05e1\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0\u05e0\u05d6' \u05d2\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05e9\u05d9\u05d4 \u05de\u05e6\u05d3 \u05d0\u05de\u05d4. \u05de\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4, \u05e1\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05e1\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0\u05e0\u05d6' \u05d7\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05e7\u05ea \u05de\u05d4\u05d4\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d5\u05d2\u05dd \u05d4\u05e1\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4 \u05de\u05d4\u05de\u05ea\u05d7 \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e3 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d6 \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d4\u05db\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e9.\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e1\u05e8\u05d8 \u05e0\u05e4\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d5\u05e1\u05d5\u05d7\u05d8 \u05d3\u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea.\u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d8\u05e8\u05dd \u05d9\u05e6\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05ea\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea. \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d1\u05de\u05e1\u05d2\u05e8\u05ea \u05e7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e6\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (\"\u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\u05df\" \u05e9\u05dc \u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9 \u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05d0\u05e8)."}, {"userName": "Meital Ben-Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33499409-meital-ben-daniel", "userReview": "Another great historical romance told by Alyson Richman.

I must admit that it took me three starts to get into this book. I normally like detailed writing but I found that especially the beginning was so bogged down in descriptive details of Marthe de Florian\u2019s possessions that I grew tired of it. Ms. deFlorian did not achieve this wealth because of any great accomplishments or inheritance but rather because she was a courtesan for a wealthy married man. I also could have done without the explicit descriptions of positions that they used during sex. She sought out Chinese art which showed the many positions of love making. That said there was the relationship with her granddaughter Solange who first is introduced to her grandmother in 1938. Solange is an author and spends time with Marthe for two years. Marthe tells her story to her granddaughter including how she acquired each piece of art, porcelain, and other beautiful objects. The most impressive piece that she owns is a portrait of herself which was commissioned by a well known artist of the time. During all of this time I really didn\u2019t see an real emotional attachment being formed between the two women, maybe it just got lost in the details.In 1940 right before the German occupation and after Marthe\u2019s death, Solange locks the apartment for the last time and fleeing Paris. It is really not clear to me why she never returned to the apartment. I would have liked to have more time spent in describing the rest of Solange\u2019s life but the story just \u201cstopped\u201d.I appreciate that there is definitely some good writing here but I don\u2019t think that I could recommend it. I would also caution readers who might be offended by some of the explicit sex in this book.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher and NetGalley, thank you."}, {"userName": "Sue ", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/690922-sue", "userReview": "\"Those hours were like velvet to me. Stories spun of silken thread\"This wonderful novel brings together two stories based in Paris. The first story is that of Marthe deFlorian, a poor girl who became a courtesan during the Belle Epoque era and her granddaughter Solange who doesn't even know of Marthe's existence until 1938. After they meet, Marthe starts sharing the story of her life with her granddaughter who wants to be an author. Over the two years that they talk, Solange learns about her grandmothers life and her love of art and beautiful objects. In 1940, after Marthe's death, Solange locks her grandmothers apartment for the last time before she flees Paris before the Germans arrive. This apartment was not unlocked again until 2010 after the death of Solange.The book alternates between the stories of the two main characters. Often in books with two main characters telling their story, I like one more than the other but with this book, I was equally interested in the stories of both women. They both gave a beautiful look at their time periods, not just the clothes and the art of the time but also the mood of the people in Paris. The reader can feel the unrest going on in Paris as the Germans get closer to invading France.This is a fantastic historical fiction novel with two main characters that Alyson Richman's readers won't soon forget.

Alyson Richman brilliantly weaves together the story of Marthe, a beautiful young courtesan in Paris in the 19th Century, with that of her granddaughter, Solange, a young woman discovering who she is at the onset of WWII. This is a mesmerizing look into Paris during both time periods, told in such incredible detail that you will feel as if you are in Marthe's apartment or walking along the streets of Paris. The author has once again used colors, fabrics, sounds, and scents to add layers to the story. But it is the emotions, the love, and the journeys of both Marthe and Solange that are the heart of the story, and they are characters who are so unique, you will never forget them. I leave you with a wonderful passage: \"I now knew the language of caresses, the music of escalated breath. I understood that kisses could leave their own imprint. That skin retained the memory of a lover's touch, like a fossil pressed into stone.\""}, {"userName": "Lynne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17408049-lynne", "userReview": "Made it through 60%.
