The answer is none. There is none too much semen.For proof of this, proceed directly to The Unlimited Dream Company. I couldn\u2019t name a book more semen-spangled if you held a loaded dick to my head. Even the word \u2018semen\u2019 has to hold some kind of per-page record here. If you can make your way past all the goo, this is actually quite a lovingly endearing story\u2014perhaps in spite of the fact that the predominance of it concerns a guy ejaculating flowers and shooting snakes out of his penis. Sci-Fi, so much to answer for. That said, the passages on flora and animalia alone merit inclusion on your reading list. I know Ballard gets tagged with the lazy \u2018transgressive\u2019 ribbon all the time (or at least used to; I\u2019m sure his descendants have outpaced him) and that he\u2019s notoriously hit-or-miss. Here, he\u2019s mostly \u2018hit.\u2019 Barring a bit of repetition that could have been tightened-up (did I mention semen?), the majority of Dream Co. is stunningly well-written. The core of the plot is a tricky beast; one is never sure which direction Ballard is going to end the whole shebang in but, for my money, he absolutely nails the landing. It\u2019s a beauty and, yeah, true loves eats itself. ORIf you\u2019ve ever longed to read a book where a guy transforms into a deer and fucks everything in sight while flinging cum over an entire town, then immediately pass GO.

Ballard, The Unlimited Dream CompanyA man named Blake crashes his plane in a small British town. He is transformed into a demigod in the town. Or perhaps, he is dead and this is some weird limbo he is stuck in. Or perhaps he is just mad. Anyway, Blake isn't a very reliable narrator. The story keeps getting weirder and weirder, breaking out of any form of simple narrative and becoming fractured, recursive, fractaled, contradictory. As this book begins to \"take flight\" and enters into fertile vision territory, it begins to seed and grow into some funky William Blake inspired story. In a lot of ways, this novel is a \"retelling/reincarnation\" of Blake's poem Milton (just as in Milton, Blake was reinterpreting/retelling/reincarnating Milton's masterpiece 'Paradise Lost'). Confused? That is OK. This book shouldn't even be thought of as dystopian or science fiction. In reality is a surreal fantasy, a vision-based parable, a verdent exploration of death, sex, and life. Read it like you would look at a painting Salvador Dal\u00ed might have done if he was exploring the art of William Blake."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I find it difficult to know how to talk about this book. I loved the vibrant writing and surreal story, but could not recommend this to 95% of the readers I know. Why? Well, you see... Blake is a bit of a loser. He steals a plane and crashes it into the Thames at Shepperton, and that's when everything goes a bit strange. He develops strong desires for everyone and everything in the town (see 95% comment earlier). Just like in dreams, relationships have no consequences, people can fly and commune with the sea and forest creatures. Blake becomes like a pagan dream god - even spreading his semen around grows a tropical rainforest. And yes, I said the word semen. Trust me, if you can't take it the two times in this review, this is not the book for you.But maybe you are a reader who can push aside all of your senses of moral violation to enjoy the writing, the description, the dreamy world of this book. If you can, you should. I couldn't put it down. The aerial wedding scene is particularly memorable. \"When they had gone, I walked alone through the late afternoon, my damp suit covered with a coat of rainbows, a confetti of petals, celebrating my marriage with the meadow.\"I've marked this as sci-fi/fantasy, and it isn't really... more absurdist/surrealism. In a brief interview in the back, Ballard says he started writing sci-fi. I am hooked and want to read more. There is a beautiful recent volume of complete short stories that might be the next thing I hunt down."}, {"userName": "David Peak", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6407188-david-peak", "userReview": "Top-tier Ballard, in the same realm as The Atrocity Exhibition, Crash, and High-Rise, despite each of those books being so different from one another. Blake's frenetic and hallucinatory rebirth after death wavers from euphoria to outright horror, sometimes in the same moment, and while dreamlike, the events are consistently relayed through Ballard's sharp and smart prose.

Why? Because I LOATHED this book and continuing to read it was worse than the time I got three detentions at school on my birthday, worse than waiting for the results of a medical test that might prove you have a horrible disease, worse than being trapped in a train compartment with an interminable bore. I just needed it to be OVER. So why did I continue to the end, and not throw the book in the dustbin, or flush it down the loo or donate it to the nearest organised Bonfire Night event? Because I was hoping that at some point I would discover some coherence or meaning to make the awfulness of wasting my life on this book worthwhile. This was a forlorn hope.When I was young, I devoured science fiction novels so fast that I had read almost all they had in my local library by the time I was about 15. And yet, I never read anything by J G Ballard, supposedly one of the giants of this genre. I know that there have been many attempts by many people, most of them cleverer than me, to define SF. I don't know what SF is, but I can say with certainty, this wasn't it. There was no science here, no logic. It was like the demented, rambling outpourings of a sex maniac on LSD.I have never thought that I was a prude, but I prefer my reading not to have semen on every page (if Ballard was paid for every time he used the word, he must have been very well paid). Other people's sex is boring and his vision of sex, paedophilia, incest, semen, shit, blood and pus was stomach churningly disgusting.I suspect this was intended to be some sort of Eden parable since the whole unclothed population of Shepperton \"did not know they were naked\". I was bored the second time this was mentioned, never mind the 3rd, 4th, 5th and nth.You might have gathered that I didn't much like this book! The best thing I can say about it is that it was not badly written, in fact, J G Ballard is probably quite a good writer. It's a pity, therefore, that he wasted his talent on this load of meaningless drivel."}, {"userName": "Jason Coleman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903942-jason-coleman", "userReview": "This book gets off to a good start, with one of those great, swift openings of Ballard's that throws you right in the deep end (early chapter title: \"I Steal the Aircraft\").

[He has] drowned in his aircraft, but frees himself by an enormous effort of the imagination, and through the effort of his imagination transforms Shepperton into a kind of Edenic paradise, full of exotic plants and animals.'I know I've given the book a three star rating (this may change \"Bitches in Bookshops\" style given time (postscript: this indeed has changed over time)), which along with the majority of Russell Hoban books I've rated, doesn't mean to come off as complete indifference. As with\u00a0Ballard's Crash and the aforementioned Hoban books, this book was powerful enough on the first read to stay with me for the next decade. Mostly due to the fact that The Unlimited Dream Company is quite esoteric in the overt symbolism throughout which I really like. The central figure is a drowned pilot who has dreams of turning into animals, which in turn, as quoted above, is the catalyst for the strange events which take place in Shepperton. There are characters and pieces of dialogue which were striking to read. It's more a Blakean poem than the other media generation apocalyptic novels Ballard is known for on a surface level. In this novel the culture presented isn't terrifically specific, more universal: man's inner paradise of imagination vs the deadness of reality/society which surrounds him.For me, some of the best lines\u00a0of dialogue across film/literature/theatre\u00a0is contained in this novel when Blake tells Miriam he will make flowers from her various parts of her body*, which called to mind the dialogue in Angela Carter's apocalyptic novella Heroes and Villains. In many ways this book also reminded me of Ted Hughes' Gaudete, going so far as acting as a key to better understand Gaudete. Both contain a central figure who challenges the environment around them, both are held in two places at once: living and dead, hidden. The dualistic primitive yet spiritual nature of brutal, 'deviant' sexuality is presented as an act to birth an awakening of sorts, something which is positive in Ballard's novella and can be seen as more destructive in Hughes' poem.Both texts also complement each other in addressing the shamanistic role of the writer. I think all writers utilise (/subvert and play with) their experiences to underpin\u00a0their fiction, whether these are real life events or half daydreams, and why? To what purpose\u00a0if not to inform, entertain, communicate\u00a0and\u00a0express an idea or thought or feeling, and interact with the reader on some level.\u00a0There are probably countless interviews by Hughes on this, but for the purpose of this post, Ballard touches on that role nicely as well:'In many ways I feel that, without realising it at the time, that I was writing a piece of my autobiography, that it's about the writers' imagination, and in particular, my own imagination. Transforming the humdrum reality that he occupies and turning it into an unlimited dream company.'(quoted J. G. Ballard comes from this interview with him that took place in 1993:\u00a0http://vimeo.com/23066777)* The quote in full (and what a stunning couple of lines at that):'Miriam - I'll give you any flowers you want!' Rhapsodizing over the thousand scents of her body, I exclaimed: 'I'll grow orchids from your hands, roses from your breasts. You can have magnolias in your hair...!''And in my heart?''In your womb I'll set a fly-trap!'[first read in 2012, this review was written June 2012 & you can also find this on wordpress]"}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23445895-blair", "userReview": "One of my best friends bought me a used copy of this for my 26th birthday.

It was the first work by Ballard I had ever read and it was one of those times when you first taste a well-established writer's work and wonder, \"why the fuck haven't I been reading so-and-so's work for years?\" The balance of unabashed sexuality, psychedelic experience, violence, and (somehow, still) classic tropes was so cleanly new to me it was intoxicating. Of course, there's the bias that Unlimited Dream Company was my first Ballard experience - of which I've had many more since - but I still find this novel to be more daring and boundary-breaking of all his work I've read. Ballard is often undervalued, I think, because he reuses certain themes and styles, especially in his short stories. But that shouldn't take away from his ability to have his finger on the pulse of the things in our culture that make us feel both uncomfortable and excited and the same time.

The refrain that the vices of the present are seen as metaphors for the virtues of the future repeat and resonate through the book's pages. Old ways of thinking about religion need to be discarded.

A hash is a sort of mashup of a fun run, scavenger hunt, and night at the bar all rolled into one. The groups that put these on are called kennels, and they exist all over the world. And every one of them is unique in how much they run, drink, and engage in generalized debauchery. I started hashing in Oxford, Mississippi, with a group mostly composed of military guys and a few counter culture weirdos. Those hashes were heavy on the running and the drinking (my favorite hash of all time was six miles long with eight \"beer stops\" along the trail, which was mostly through the woods). Then I moved to Memphis. I started hashing there to meet new friends, which I did, but I never loved hashing in Memphis as much. There were a bunch of out of shape swingers that were a part of the kennel, so hashes in Memphis tended to skimp on running through the woods and go over-the-top on the debauchery. I don't self-identify as a prude, but I never loved that atmosphere, it was just too much for me to ever totally embrace. I missed the exhaustion and cuts and bruises that accompanied an inebriated run through unmolested forest and swamp, activities that may have been adult in nature (if immature) but were always innocuous at their core. J.G. Ballard's oeuvre has a sort of consistency to it. If someone described a book as \"Ballardian,\" I would immediately get a general sense of what they meant. With the exception of Empire of the Sun, his books are a hallucinatory mix of disillusionment, disassociation, violence, and sex. That ratio varies; High Rise is heavy with violence and sex, whereas The Drowned World is more cerebral, exploring the degree to which our civilized veneer melts away with declining creature comforts and stability. And I love both of those books.If a mix of those elements makes a book Ballardian, The Unlimited Dream Company is the most Ballardian book I've read yet. Everything I find so fascinating about his work is cranked up to eleven, with a hyper-sexual and violent protagonist, a plane crash (vehicular wrecks are a staple of Ballard's novels), and a surreal, changing landscape that toes a line between dream and nightmare. Starting this book, I really felt like I should have enjoyed it. But I didn't. The sexual content of The Unlimited Dream Company was surely a metaphor for something, but I could not ascertain what. It was weird, and it was incredibly creepy. The psychedelic descriptions of the village of Shepperton, where the protagonist crash lands early in the story, should have served to dilute the discomfort of that content, but as the book progressed, I felt that it instead acted as a catalyst, amplifying the nausea induced by the narrator-protagonist's mores. About halfway through, I stopped reading this book, and reverted more to skimming it, which I continued to do until the very end. I usually don't enjoy reading Ballard in the sense that his books induce a mild stress, but I like reading them, because his prose is fantastic. I did not enjoy reading The Unlimited Dream Company, and this time I mean that in the sense that I actively disliked it. I know other people will enjoy reading it, because they'll be able to look past the sexually violent dreamscape that it becomes a third of the way through at the latest and parse what Ballard was trying to say through this novel. But I couldn't suppress a sense of unease that transcended the typical anxiety that I get when I read his work, and that unease started several pages in and just never let up.

Tropical flora and fauna appear; pan-sexual celebrations occur regularly; and in a final climax of liberation, the townspeople learn to fly.\u2019Blurb from the 1990 Paladin paperback edition.Ballard plunges us headlong into a Messianic fantasy which begins when his hero, Blake, steals a Cessna aeroplane from an airfield and crashes into the river at Shepperton.The setting is important as Shepperton is a place famous for its film and TV studios and stands symbolically in the British consciousness as a media Mecca.Blake escapes from the plane, collapses, and is revived by the amazed townsfolk who tell him that he had been dead for about eleven minutes.Following his \u2018resurrection\u2019 Blake begins to entertain sexual fantasies as tropical birds and flora start to manifest and transform the town into a jungle paradise.The symbolism of the plane could be read as that of a cruciform, emphasised by the fact that the crippled children whom he befriends, collect pieces of the dead plane like the relics of a Saint.Blake is involved with four people in particular:-Miriam St Cloud: Miriam is a doctor. Her scientific scepticism is damaged immediately by Blake\u2019s apparent return from the dead. Later she becomes \u2013 at least in the eyes of Blake\u2019s followers \u2013 his bride.Mrs St Cloud: Miriam\u2019s mother. Blake engages in a feverish act of sex with her which transforms into a symbolic act of birth with Mrs St Cloud giving birth to Blake, born anew. Thus she becomes a mother figure. The father figure is the Reverend Wingate, a \u2018father\u2019 in the religious as well as symbolic sense, filling the role of father to Blake. Wingate is the first to see Blake\u2019s \u2018divinity\u2019 and hands over his church to him to do with as he wants.Finally, there is Starks. His role seems to be as a Judas and to oppose Blake. Indeed, some aspects of his life are the antithesis of Blake\u2019s. he cages or kills animals or birds. Blake seems to generate animals and birds which are far happier and healthier than Starks\u2019 caged specimens.As Blake\u2019s powers increase, Shepperton is transformed into a jungle and in his dreams Blake himself turns into a bird or whale and in turn transforms the townsfolk into appropriate creatures to accompany him. When he awakens it appears that the townsfolk seem to remember having the same \u2018dream\u2019.The Messianic drama continues. Blake begins to heal people. He absorbs people into his own body (symbolic cannibalism) and, in a kind of orgiastic carnival, teaches the entire town how to fly.As with many messiahs, his followers \u2013 led by Starks \u2013 eventually turn on him and he is killed again, his body left in the strange shrine-cum-grave which the disabled children have been building from dead flowers and Blake\u2019s \u2018relics\u2019.Then, by absorbing the life-forces of the creatures of the forest, he rebuilds his body, acquiring aspects of the various creatures of the woodland and rises once more, this time transforming the entire population of Shepperton and releasing them into what Ballard terms \u2018the true reality.\u2019As in \u2018Concrete Island\u2019 the hero finds himself trapped in a specific environment, and is forced to either adapt himself to it or fight to escape. In this case, as escape seems impossible (the landscape recedes whenever he tries and he can never pass the barrier) he is forced to transform the environment to suit himself.There are other Ballard motifs. We have the low-flying aircraft; his obsession with modernistic public architecture (a multi-storey car-park is the venue for Blake\u2019s marriage to Miriam); the exotic landscape which permeates most of the book, and sexual fetishism and transference.It is not an easy novel, but then Ballard\u2019s novels are never easy to understand, but unlike other \u2018difficult\u2019 books Ballard\u2019s work can be read for the sheer poetic beauty and the imagery alone."}], "description": "When a light aircraft crashes into the Thames at Shepperton, the young pilot who struggles to the surface minutes later seems to have come back from the dead. Within hours everything in the dormitory suburb is transformed. Vultures invade rooftops, luxuriant tropical vegetation overruns the quiet avenues, and the local inhabitants are propelled by the young man\u2019s urgent visions through ecstatic sexual celebrations toward an apocalyptic climax. In this characteristically inventive novel Ballard displays to devastating effect the extraordinary imagination that has established him as one of the twentieth century\u2019s most visionary writers.", "title": "The Unlimited Dream Company", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16234589-the-unlimited-dream-company", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361148557l/16234589.jpg", "reviews": 99, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7010931.J_G_Ballard", "name": "J.G.
