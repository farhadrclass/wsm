The Vanishing Act has received rave reviews, and it is worth clarifying that I understand entirely why that is. I just disagree with the general consensus. The Vanishing Act has received those rave reviews because it is short, charming book that stands out both for the strength of its prose and its originality. And it is true to say that it is, fundamentally, written very well. However, for me there was one utterly fundamental problem with this book, and that is that for all of the fantastic writing, there isn't actually any plot. It's a book about a girl focusing on the disappearance of her mother, but in fact what happens is that the girl considers her mother's disappearance and assesses it, with more than a few references to basic philosophy and with the help of several one dimensional characters. But that is all. There is little in the way of character development once all the characters have been introduced, and even less in the way of plot progression. The one aspect of the plot that could be considered a twist is blindingly obvious (or at least it was to me) long before it is revealed, but without any sort of advancement in the rest of the plot it was difficult to care about that twist anyway. I could talk more about other positives and negatives about the book, one negative being that the author has a disorientating habit of jumping into flashbacks without any sort of warning, and the clear positive being that, at times, it is very enjoyable to read. But the lack of a plot in the book is a killer blow for me. It is a real shame, because the potential in this book is clear. But without answering any of the questions that the book poses, it's difficult for me to consider that as a novel there is much overarching merit to be awarded here. It may well be that the book would be a useful educational tool for school children to assess, but as a book in its own right it left me feeling distinctly underwhelmed."}, {"userName": "Leslie Lehr", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7447748-leslie-lehr", "userReview": "I grabbed this book from my stack of must-reads to take to the hospital because it was light. When my surgery was pushed back and I was left alone in the corner bed with an IV and warm blankets and no phone, I opened this book and escaped into another world. When the surgeon apologized for the delay then left me alone, I hid my delight in returning to this magical island as if it was my own vanishing act. Mette Jakobsen's lovely novel is a sensory poem about a little girl on an island torn between her father's philosophy of reason and her mysterious mother's creative world view. A past war brought these colorful characters together on this solitary island, but it is the presence of a dead boy who brings Minou to question it. The story flows simply and the message is subtle, but I could feel the wind and smell the sea. The next day, as I recovered from surgery, I read the ending and understood. There is great calm and comfort for both Minou and the reader in these pages."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2069203-elizabeth", "userReview": "Melancholic and thoughtful. This is a strange book filled with fragile characters. It is part-fable, part study of the isolated, and part mystery. Nothing much is resolved or explained and the dreamy prose almost makes up for it. Almost. Still, I enjoyed the beautiful language and details of island life.

Gorgeous imagery, philosophy, and art combine to make a novel that may be enjoyed by adults, teens, or precocious twelve year-olds. Minou lives on a small island, one that can be walked around in under an hour. In addition to Minou and her lighthouse, there is her father, a priest in the church, Boxman and his dog, No Name, in the barn, and, before she vanished, Minou's mother. One year ago Minou's mother disappeared. Though it is believed that she died, Minou knows she didn't- and can rationally prove it. Her father's devotion to philosophy and her mother's love of art and imagination combine in Minou. When a dead boy washes up on the shore, he brings with him the smell of oranges and questions both physical and philosophical. It will take both her understanding of philosophy and her mother's love of art and imagination for Minou to process the visitor.Like Erin Morgenstern's The Night Circus, reading the The Vanishing Act is like peering into a snow globe. Though I can imagine what characters are thinking, I am removed from them, observing their strange, miniature world, my nose pressed right up against the glass. And like an intricate miniature, I want to carry this gem around, to peer into the world Mette Jakobsen has created whenever the mood strikes. The Vanishing Act doesn't disappear with the turn of the final page, but has stayed with me, alternately haunting and niggling my mind.In the end, I wanted a little more information about the experiences Minou's parents had during the war and about where her mother might have gone. I think the postcard was a wonderful suggestion that Minou has found her philosophy, but I wanted it to (at least momentarily) enlighten her father, too. But despite these desires, I still adore the book and want a copy to carry in my pocket."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5242679-brooke", "userReview": "Erin Morgenstern's ( author of The Night Circus) review of this book is what made me want to read this.

The best stories change you I am not the same after The Vanishing Act as I was before.\"Being an Erin Morgenstern fan and loving her review of this book wasn't enough for me...The Vanishing Act for me was a jumbled mess. It did not flow very well because the story kept changing to many times from past to present. The main story wasn't bad and every once in awhile I was like \"okay now that was described kind of beautifully...\"But overall not a very good book in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "The Vanishing Act is the fairytale-like story of Minou, a young girl who lives on a tiny, remote island with her father, who considers himself a philosopher: her mother has disappeared and is believed by everyone else to be dead. The island is so small that it only has two other residents - a magician (and his dog) and a priest. The story opens with the frozen corpse of a boy washing up on the beach, and as Minou and her father wait for a boat from the mainland to retrieve the body, she examines her memories of her mother and of her own life, questioning both her path in life and her conviction that her mother is still alive.For the first time in a long time I find myself with absolutely no idea how to categorise a book. Is it magical realism? Perhaps, but nothing magical actually happens when you examine the story, even though it feels very far from any recognisable reality. Is it historical fiction? Possibly, as 'the war' is frequently referenced, and there's certainly no modern technology on the island, but there are no clues to where in the world the story is meant to be taking place, and the war is never directly identified. The most popular category chosen so far on Goodreads is 'fantasy', but it's not truly fantastical in any obvious way, though the book definitely has that feel about it. It could certainly be read by children but feels like it was written for adults, and as far as I know it is being marketed as adult fiction.The whole story is whimsical and twee almost beyond belief, and I found its quirks really annoying, with the philosophical asides seeming very cursory. The more I think about this, actually, the more I think it would perhaps be better off as a book for children - seen through that lens, I suppose the characters might be considered amusing: I couldn't help but see them as bizarre and ridiculously unrealistic. With so few characters it is hardly difficult to work out what the solution to the 'mystery' is going to be, and I thought the 'twist' was supposed to be obvious from the beginning (again, a younger reader probably wouldn't pick up on this quite as easily). However, despite my reservations, I did want to keep reading - the story has a certain timeless charm.The Vanishing Act has been praised by Erin Morgenstern, author of The Night Circus: it may also appeal to fans of The Snow Child and The Girl with Glass Feet - though all of those books are better than this one. It's reasonably good for a bit of enchanting escapism, but rather insubstantial and, if it is a fable, then I'm afraid it didn't teach me anything."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane", "userReview": "\u201cYou might not believe my story. You might read it as a fairytale, a fable straight out of my imagination.\u201dSo says twelve year-old Minou. She lives on a small, remote, nameless island Minou with her Papa, who is a philosopher and a fisherman. The island has only just two more residents. Priest and Boxman. A holy man and a magician.Why they are there, what happened in the past isn\u2019t clear, isn\u2019t clear. And there are other questions in the air.What happened to Minou\u2019s Mama?She set out for a walk in her very best shoes, and she didn\u2019t come back. The grown-ups said that she must have had an accident, that she must be dead. But Minou knew better. She knew that Mama had set out to have a grand adventure, and that she would be back soon.And where did the boy come from?The body of a young boy washed up the shore, and his body had been brought up and laid out to wait for the supply boat to take him back to the mainland. Minou where he has come from, what he has seen. And she tells him stories, sure that he has come to help her to put together all the memories and all the clues that will lead her to her Mama.Minou is an engaging narrator and a charming child: a rational seeker of truth, like her Papa, and an imaginative, creative artist, like her Mama. It is so easy to empathise with her, to understand her moment of loneliness, to warm to her relationship with Papa, to be touched by her unfailing hope that Mama will come back to her, to love her joy in the world around her.She tells her story in beautiful, clear prose, full of ideas and images. It illuminates her stories, the remoteness and loneliness of the only home she has ever known, and the sadness that haunts the adults around her. Minou is, of course, too young to grasp all of the implications of what is happening around her but her words say more than she knows.So much in this little book is irresistible.\u201cIt is in the heart and not in the words \u2013 not even in the most beautiful ones \u2013 but in the heart, in the skeleton bird pushing against your chest, wanting to fly, that we know for certain who and what we love. That is all we have, and all there is.\u201dBut it\u2019s not quite perfect.The story is too slight and the characters are too simply drawn to catch all of the images and ideas that are thrown into the air. Some of the simplicity is, of course, the result of Minou\u2019s youth, there were moments when I felt that the characters were only there to present those images and ideas.And the story of Minou\u2019s Mama didn\u2019t quite work: it was predictable, and in a \u2018she\u2019s that sort of woman and so this will be her destiny\u2019 kind of way.It was still lovely: Minou, the pictures she painted, the ideas she explored.Just not quite as lovely as I\u2019d hoped."}, {"userName": "Latie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10574830-latie", "userReview": "As I was reading this book I initially found it interesting, unique, and written with a consistent atmosphere of magic. However when I made it to the final page of the book I found myself puzzled. Jakobsen narrates the book from a 12 year olds point of view, Minou, who resides on a tiny island with a band of misfit characters: a philosopher, a priest, a magician, a dog and a dead boy. I kept looking for connections, hidden meanings, or for Minou to explain things. No answers came. Despite this, the book stuck with me, mainly because I thought there was a mystery to unravel. I suppose I related to Papa, the Philosopher of the book who spends his days looking for answers in life\u2019s greatest mysteries. After thinking about it for quite some time, I suppose Jakobsen wants the readers to acknowledge that there will be mysteries and forces we will encounter in life that cannot be explained. Circumstances that we can pick apart and still not discover satisfying answers. Instead we should look at the big picture and not get caught up in the fine details that make up art. Overall I will give the book a 3/5. It is written beautifully almost in a poetic style, and has an unusual but charming setting. There are also some good lessons and quotes to be found in the book. However I found the plot inconsistent and without needed development to tie some lose ends. Additionally I think this book was written with a younger audience in mind (tweens/teens) which may be why I didn\u2019t find it as inspiring as other readers have. Happy Reading."}, {"userName": "Alison Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5277478-alison-kennedy", "userReview": "I just didn't get this. I'm sure it was one giant metaphor for loss but it just felt overly lengthy and lacking in any kind of plot! All this philosophical discussion versus imagination. The setting was a horribly isolated and cold island (my worst nightmare - cold and hardly any people!). The father figure seemed a bit less than capable of bringing up a child - what with the indoctrination of philosophical thinking as the only way of seeing the world. Then there was the acquisition of a frozen dead body from which he was supposedly going to discover the Truth - not an ideal environment for a child and having her sit with a dead body was rather bizarre. The twist was so glaringly obvious and the prose was poetic at times but I have read better and the structure was disorientating to the extent it discouraged engagement with the tale.As I say, I do believe it was all probably about death and loss of her mother but it felt utterly pointless to me. I love a good metaphor but this was just beyond enjoyable. Definitely not my kind of book."}, {"userName": "TheBookSmugglers", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1223249-thebooksmugglers", "userReview": "\u201cPhilosophers step back and look at the big picture.\u201d \u201cThat is not what Mama does.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Papa agreed. \u201cShe says the tiniest brush stroke matters.\u201d \u201cBut sometimes, my girl, when you look in such detail, you lose the big picture.\u201dMinou lives on a tiny isolated (and nameless) island alongside her wannabe philosopher-fisherman Papa, the heartbroken magician Boxman, the pretzel-making Priest and the dog No-Name. Only one person is missing: Minou\u2019s Mama, who disappeared one year earlier after she left the house for a walk wearing her best shoes. Everybody thinks Mama is dead but Minou believes she will be back soon.One day the body of a young boy washes up the shore and Papa decides to bring the body inside their house where it will wait for the supplies boat, three days away. Her father thinks the boy will help him \u2013 finally \u2013 to find the Absolute Truth. Minou thinks the dead boy can explain her mother\u2019s absence if only she can put together all the memories and all the clues leading up to that fateful day.The Vanishing Act is one of those books there are really hard to pin down. Perhaps the best metaphor would be \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d: the poetic prose and the engaging philosophical core disguising an extremely common-place plot with stereotypical characters.At first glance, it seems a magical little story about a girl\u2019s coming-of-age as she comes to terms with her mother\u2019s disappearance. The prose is beautiful, clear and often disguises a poignancy surrounding the lives of the adults within the story that the narrator \u2013 being a young, green girl \u2013 can\u2019t quite grasp but which is painfully clear to the reader. It is quite easy to infer for example, that her father\u2019s nightmares about \u201chiding in a cellar\u201d through \u201cthe war\u201d, hints at him being a WWII survivor. The author also skilfully presents the remoteness and the sense of isolation of its setting.The story unfolds slowly as Minou relives her memories of her mother and the moments that have shaped her life so far. As such, we see how she has always thought herself to be just like her father whom she often sided with: a logical truth-searcher. But in reality she is also just like her Mama: an imaginative, creative artiste. Perhaps the best aspect about The Vanishing Act is exactly the fact that Minou embodies a combination of traits that dismantle the false dichotomy that you can only be a logical thinker OR a creative soul but not both. As such, Papa is portrayed as quite the sad figure \u2013 trying so hard to explain what happened to him during the war by attempting to go at it via an extremely logical route, believing that scholars\u2019 ideas are unquestionable.The book loses much of its appeal when we look at its small details though. These are very hard to avoid in the very controlled, small environment of the novel. There is a clear attempt to present these characters and their lives as perhaps \u201cuniversal\u201d truths in themselves or at least that\u2019s how one could interpret the fact that none of the characters apart from Minou have actual names or personalities. As such, the Priest doesn\u2019t do much beyond \u201cPriestly\u201d things and \u201cBoxman\u201d is a mysterious magician whose allure proved to be too much for Mama. This brings me to the biggest problem I had with the novel \u2013 which is Mama\u2019s portrayal as a quirky bunch of stereotypes that Lead to Her Death.Beware: we are about to enter slightly spoilery territory now.Because of course Mama is a Mysteriously Exuberant Woman with her Bright Red Hair and her Creativity Soul. Even the story of how she arrived on the island reinforces this with her surprising arrival carrying a live peacock, wearing flowers on her hair and being object of Papa\u2019s love at first sight. And of course, she is also the only soul that cannot bear the confinement of the island, who ends up having a run-of-the-mill affair with the man-next-door and who ends up obviously Tragically Dying because of her Anguished Sadness (her death either suicide or Dramatic Fall off a Cliff).One could easily argue though that these aspects are portrayed as such because of Minou\u2019s limited narrative as a young girl. But I did not feel that the text itself questioned this portrayal in any way. I also can\u2019t help but to feel that we are perhaps to feel more sympathetic toward the father and his sadly pathetic life rather than the cheating Mama who dared going for a walk and never came back.All of that said, The Vanishing Act is a charming fast read. I enjoyed reading it to a certain extent but do not, in any way, shape or form feel that my life has been altered for doing so (points at Dramatic Front Page Blurb)."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11215659-jean", "userReview": "The Vanishing Act was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Book Prize 2012. Its opening is striking as Minou finds a dead boy in the very first sentence. The novel is written in the first person, with Minou as narrator and we are introduced to life on the island through Minou's eyes. It is nearly a year since her mother disappeared, and Minou believes that her mother will come back to the island. The island is remote; the only other persons on the island are Minou\u2019s father, Boxman (and his dog No Name) and Priest. Minou's father enjoys philosophy whereas her mother placed imagination above the realm of rationality; Minou attempts to use philosophical reasoning to construct a watertight theory that her mother will return. As the novel touches on philosophy with mention of Descartes and Kant, it would provide a gentle introduction to philosophy for curious Year 6 readers, and open up conversations about reason and imagination; different skills we use to interpret the world. Minou speaks to the dead boy and writes down what is happening so that she will be able to update her mother when she returns. The novel explores the different ways Minou is coming to terms with the disappearance of her mother; speaking to the dead boy, writing stories and writing a diary. It would enable a class to explore the different ways we untangle events - thinking, speaking to others, writing things down, recording events, and the values of being good listeners. It deals sensitively with loss and surprise. The tone is quite understated in which the author creates an atmosphere of remoteness and potential loneliness. An interesting activity would be to discuss the book\u2019s title, both before and after reading the novel, as it has more than one meaning. I would recommend the book for Year 6 readers."}, {"userName": "Chris Chester", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2660837-chris-chester", "userReview": "I wasn't quite as enchanted by The Vanishing Act as some other reviewers. It's short, sparsely worded and sparsely populated, giving it an airy, magical feel. Given the limited canvas that Jakobsen was working with then, it's a little disappointing that her characters are lacking in depth, adhering more to the rough shapes and outlines in a children's book.At the same time, Jakobsen, a student of philosophy, seems to be trying to broach very adult topics. I have a suspicion that this novel was intended to persuade fans of Descartes' pure reason to step back from their notion of logic and embrace their hearts to a greater degree. But then, the heartfelt artists in the book are also deeply and profoundly flawed, so perhaps we're intended to fall somewhere in the middle.I don't know that I would recommend this book to many people, because how many people do you know that are interested in essentially YA fiction that also name drops Descartes every other page? Still, a good first effort. I'd like to see her next work attempt a narrative of greater substance."}, {"userName": "Merilyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8159532-merilyn", "userReview": "Fable-like tale set on a tiny, freezing island which has an out of commission lighthouse.

Minou discovers a dead boy washed up onto the beach and the novel covers the three days during which he lies frozen in Mama's bedroom, waiting for the supply boat to comes.

This is what she says: \"This book is a precious thing. I want to keep it in a painted box with a raven feather and sea-polished stones, taking it out when I feel the need to visit Minou on her island again. The best stories change you. I am not the same after The Vanishing Act as I was before.\"I don't think I loved it that much, but I certainly did enjoy it, and it's a very enchanting book. It's the story of Minou, who lives on a tiny snow-covered island with her philosopher Papa. The other inhabitants of the island are Boxman the magician, No-Name, his dog, and Priest the priest. A year before the story begins, Minou's mother disappeared. Minou knows that she isn't dead, despite her shoe being found washed up. Then one day, Minou finds a dead boy washed up on the beach. Her father lays him in her mother's room. Can Minou's mother's disappearance be explained by him? Minou will not accept that her mother is dead and using Descartes, is determined to find out what happened.I thought this was a very interesting one, with an interesting premise. I love stories like this; however I didn't love this one, though I really liked it. I thought Minou's parents were interesting: her father is a philosopher-type, and he's interested in proofing everything with logic and reason, whereas her mother is more interested in the imagination. Two very different people, and then you have Minou, who tends more to reasoning and logic, but also the imagination.This book definitely feels like a fable, and I'm very glad that I got it from W.W. Norton. I didn't love the writing style, but it was sweet and simple. Not nearly as good as Erin Morgenstern's writing style though. Still, I would definitely recommend it. I've included both the US and UK covers, as well as the Australian (original) cover. I think I like the British one best (the one on the left).\"The first time I read the book I think I kind of rushed through it to get to the end, because I wanted to finish it quickly and read other things. And I didn't enjoy the book as much because of it. I still don't think it's an amazing book, but I did like it more reading it a second time. As with most characters who are around my age, I felt that the narration was a little simplistic, as if Minou wasn't really twelve. She seemed more like ten or so, and there's nothing wrong with that. She sees things happening around her very clearly, without understanding a lot of their implications. She just writes them down. But we, the reader, can presumably understand them a bit more than her, and that is what makes the book moving. There's so much tension on the island that Minou cannot sense but doesn't really understand. The Vanishing Act is a very under-appreciated novel; it was first published in Australia, and maybe Americans just aren't interested enough in this sort of thing. All I know is that on Amazon, the hardcover edition was $2.10 and is now $7.50, as opposed to the original price of $23.95. That's disgraceful. And it's not even a bargain book! It's just the original hardcover edition. You can take advantage of that low price though. The book can be bought here, and even though the paperback edition is out, the hardcover is way cheaper. Anyway, why am I talking about this mundane stuff? The Vanishing Act is set in a dreamy world between fantasy and reality; in other words, it is magic realism, one of my favorite genres as long as the book is not too surreal. And The Vanishing Act is in some ways, but not too much. This is a beautiful little tale, and I'm certainly glad I reread it. It's really worth reading, and it should have gotten a little more attention than it did on its release in the United States.

Within the first chapter of The Vanishing Act by Mette Jakobsen, I felt drawn to the novel\u2019s tiny island.Seemingly frozen in time, the tiny island is home to a handful of people. At first glance, these folks escaped to the island because they couldn\u2019t take the regular world anymore. There\u2019s Priest who bakes incessantly, a magician who makes magic boxes, Papa the philosopher (who claims to be a descendant of Descartes), and Minou, the philosopher\u2019s daughter.Minou stumbles upon a dead boy in the snow. Her father brings the boy to their home until the next shipping boat is scheduled to arrive. Her father, who is on a journey to discover the truth, encourages Minou to talk to the boy. The frozen, dead boy is a catalyst for Minou as she comes to terms with her mother\u2019s disappearance. All the adults on the island is convinced that her mother is dead, but Minou reasons that it\u2019s the opposite.Read the rest of the review on my blog: http://www.fromlefttowrite.com/book-r..."}, {"userName": "Lita", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42047932-lita", "userReview": "When I started this book I did not care for it. I found the writing style sporadic and hard to latch onto...but I am glad I stuck with it! The book centers around a young girl named Minou, who lives on a very small snowy island with a cast of colorful characters. Her mother the artist, her father the philosopher, her dog \"no name\", and her neighbors the priest and the magician. Anyone who has ever lost a close loved one should read this book. It takes us though two stages of grief that are many times kept in our minds as private - the stages of denial and acceptance - through the simplistic and innocent eyes of a child. Minou uses the only tools provided on her isolated island to process her loss...a pen and paper, a frozen dead boy, her thoughts, and the teachings given to her by the very different few people she can interact with. This is a very quick read and a book I will someday revisit...without doubt."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/418282-angie", "userReview": "3/3.5 Gosh, this book, I can hardly organize my thoughts. I finished reading it this morning and simply could not stop thinking about it. I mean, all day. It is not a fairy tale, and there is no real magic, per se, so I can't easily describe what it is that has me so gripped. The story is mysterious and melancholy and I think most readers will not be happy with the ending. I had the story figured out when I was half way through. I spent the last half of the book trying to visualize how the author was going to play it out rather than letting myself enjoy it. So I decided to read it again tonight. And I am so glad I did. Reading it in one sitting made for a better experience for me. I still really like this book for some reason I can't completely pinpoint; however, this quote may help sum it up: 'Sometimes' explained Boxman, 'sadness has a sweet, enchanting edge. It pulls at your heart and you can't get enough.'I'll be reading it again, no doubt."}, {"userName": "Gretel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7945503-gretel", "userReview": "A book written supposedly from the perspective of a child that didn't sound at all like a child. The writing is not bad; the prose is sparse with some lovely imagery sometimes, but it is not as stunning as the other reviews are making it out to be. I feel the name-dropping of philosophers is done constantly and it is pretty unbelievable that a young child would feel so invested in the subject of philosophy. Kant or Descartes are funneled into everything in this book, be it a conversation or just an innocent scenery observation. Even when preserving a dead boy's body for mainland collection you compare him to some philosopher. It's not a subject that particularly interests me, but if you're familiar with it then you may have a different reaction to the book. Maybe I just didn't 'get it'. I feel that with an interesting setting like that - a tiny island, the story could've been so much more."}, {"userName": "bct", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29660840-bct", "userReview": "I was quite disappointed when I read this book last summer after buying it in a second hand bookshop in Stratford-upon-Avon. Despite many good reviews the book has received, I for once in my life disagree. Firstly there was no plot, and every other chapter the author went back to talk about Minou's past. As the story progressed, nothing happened. It just kept going about how she longed to be with her mother. Unless there was something I did not get, I'm afraid that the story just didn't do anything for me. Halfway through, being bored, I expected a massive plot twist to get the ball rolling - except it never happened. Once I'd finished, I was quite relieved, I'm sorry to say, that it was over. Agreeably, the language was very structured and pretty, but there was just no content. It left me feeling quite sad and miserable. :("}, {"userName": "Marcie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1359040-marcie", "userReview": "I picked this book off the Staff Picks shelf of the library, and chose to take it home because it had a lovely review by Erin Morganstern, author of The Night Circus, on the back. I thought it was odd that the back of the book didn't have any kind of a summary of the plot, but after reading the book, I understand why.There was no plot.Parts of the book were written beautifully, and I can see why some people would love the whimsical fable aspect of it. But I found it disconcerting that the characters had no names, that the story skipped around in time, and that the adults on the island were incapable of raising a child. And more importantly, nothing happened. I kept thinking Minou was going to come to some philosophical discovery, but I got to the end of the book, and she didn't.

Yet it is their child Minou who stole my heart. Twelve years old, trying to make sense of her mother disappearance, using the philosophical thinking of her father and the imagination that her mother prized so highly. All centered around a dead boy who comes ashore and is kept in the lighthouse for three days. This is a hard novel to classify, it is a little bit magical, a little mystical and a little bit sad. It is about loneliness, isolation and secrets and discovery. It is a quietly deceptive novel done well."}, {"userName": "Katharine Holden", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1029616-katharine-holden", "userReview": "Weird and wonderful. I was put off at first by an over the top recommendation on the back cover by Erin Morgenstern the author of Night Circus, who blithered on about never being the same after reading this novel. And then it turned out to be true for me, too. It's everything: the island that is so tiny yet has a church and a bell tower, talking to the dead boy in the spare room while he waits for the delivery boat, the dog in his cardigan, the shoe funeral, the wonderful metaphor of cakes not turning out, Descartes' family tree, being assigned an office so small you have to leave your briefcase outside the door....such a good book and so beautifully, sadly, humorously written.

The setting evoked an aura that fascinated me. Minou was a well rounded young protagonist. I liked the magical feel that anything was possible.The plotting just left me cold. I got really bored with the characters and their slow paced interactions. I kept thinking that I was missing all sorts of symbolism. When I read something like The Great Gatsby, I want to go back and rethink the symbols. Here, I didn't care enough. What was up with that dead boy who was being kept cold in the mother's bedroom? Why did the dog have to be No Name? Oh, I know, the setting was also not named. The universality of it all? Who cares?
