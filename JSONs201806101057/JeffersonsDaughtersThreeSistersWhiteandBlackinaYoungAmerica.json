She wants to tell us about the three daughters that Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson \"raised\" to adulthood. I say \"raised\" because as you continue reading you discover just how little direct contact he often had with his daughters, particularly Harriet, who was born into slavery via her mother, Sally Hemings. Hemings had been promised freedom for her children when they turned 21 years old but Jefferson's gendered attitudes and belief in racial inequalities resulted in her never being given legal documents to protect her freed status. Instead Harriet had to pass as white and thus disappeared from historical records to protect herself and her children. Kerrison has a good chapter walking us through her look into every type of record she could to try and find out what happened to Harriet and it is a good example for wouldbe historians to understand. History is not easy to construct if one is not of the most privileged group. While there is no doubt that compared to other slaves Jefferson owned the Hemings children were treated better, they were still treated as his slaves because they were.Jefferson's daughter, Maria, leaves behind more records of her life yet because she was not the chosen companion of her father, we do not have as much as we do from the older daughter, Martha, that's I'll write about in the next paragraph. Maria comes across as a very different personality though how much of that reflects innate differences versis how they were raised and how much contact they had with their father. Maria did marry and have children but she died relatively young. Even though Jefferson claimed her death touched him, given the information that Kerrison shares his grief felt weak to me.The daughter Jefferson was closest to, Martha, was the one whom we know most about because she functioned in many ways as \"first lady\" in the family and in his political career. Martha's personality seems to change dramatically from her early life in America to her years in France to her return to America. At first, we might hope she's learned to see all humans as human from her years in a convent but records about her life back at her father's and then her plantation show she thoroughly bought into the philosophy underlying slavery and enforced it.At times the text is challenging to follow. If the chapters had been laid out one sister and then another it would have been clearer to follow perhaps but the text is more chronologically arranged. The switching between sisters' experiences and describing the world they live in feels overwhelming at times. I believe their experiences could have been better differentiated at times to help a layperson understand more easily.Even as a historian who has studied gender and slavery, this book was emotionally challenging to read. It should be difficult to read and Kerrison has done a good job of not toning down the realities."}, {"userName": "Biblio Files (takingadayoff)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff", "userReview": "Thomas Jefferson had three daughters, two with his wife Martha, and one with his slave, Sally Hemings. Jefferson's Daughters looks at how the daughters were raised, their education, upbringing, expectations, and how they fared in adulthood. Although I was aware that Jefferson had children with Sally Hemings, I did not know that Hemings was actually a half sister of his deceased wife - they had the same father. Sally Hemings' mother also probably had a white father, so Sally was, by all accounts, fair skinned and straight haired. Still, this was no love match. Sally was a slave and Jefferson treated her and her children as slaves. He made some concessions, such as allowing them to be house servants rather than field hands, but he was hardly the proud father. In fact, he was embarrassed when it became common knowledge that he was fathering children with a slave. The fact that he did not respond to the public accusations lets us know that it was not considered acceptable behavior and that Jefferson himself was well aware of that.Sally had some leverage with Jefferson, though. She had been with the Jefferson family in Paris when he was the Ambassador to France and she learned French, and more important, that if she stayed in France instead of returning to Virginia with the family, she would be a free woman. Instead, she bargained with Jefferson, who apparently wanted to continue the relationship with the sixteen year old. He agreed that any children she had with him would be freed when they reached adulthood. She decided to trust him and returned with the family to the States.Jefferson never treated the children as anything other than slaves, allotting them the usual rations and clothing allowances, not educating them, and when they became adults, he didn't actually sign over their freedom, rather he allowed them to \"escape.\" To legally free them would have been to acknowledge paternity, which he would not do.Harriet Hemings, half sister to the Jefferson girls, saw her brothers set out as free black men, and how difficult that was for them. She could only imagine how difficult it would be for a free black woman. So she decided her best bet was to pass as white. Evidently, she was able to do so. Kerrison's account at the end of the book of how she approached the puzzle of where Harriet went and who she became is a fascinating study in detection and genealogy.Excellent study of how women in an upper class American household at the turn of the 18th century lived."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1251273-susan", "userReview": "A well written biography of Thomas Jefferson's three daughters, Martha, Maria, and Harriet, the first two born to his wife, the third born to his slave, Sally Hemings. Martha has already been the subject of a full-length biography, but Maria, who died as a young woman, and Harriet, who disappeared into obscurity after being freed, have been given less attention. Much of the book is devoted to bringing the latter two out of the shadows. Kerrison looks at Maria, who has suffered in comparison with her more accomplished sister, in her own light, and attempts to reconstruct Harriet's post-slavery life. I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120873-rachel", "userReview": "This is a definite must-read for those who likes to read history, especially American history. Ever since I visited Monticello, I have been fascinated with Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemmings. This book even shared more details of Maria Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson's younger daughter, whom nothing has been written much about. I will admit that it wasn't till this past year that I realized that Thomas Jefferson had 2 daughters, since not much was mentioned about Maria. I didn't even know he had a third daughter till I read this book. This is incredibly fascinating. It is a historical research, that is packed full of information about the three daughters that I am looking at history with a renewed interest. This is not a novel, by any means. It embraces everything, especially the issue of slavery and Jefferson's descendants who were born in slavery but left, passing for white. This is a heavily researched book on Jefferson and his impact on his daughters, the people around him and while the rest of the nation celebrates his heritage as a founding father, this book exposes his human flaws in the fact that he doesn't think his daughters have a voice in the new country. It is an incredible read and one that I think would appeal to new readers to history as well as those who do research for a living. Kerrison did a fine job of tying all the ends together in her research, while admitting there is more that is left to the ages because she doesn't have all the information. What she has here is a great start, and definitely more information regarding Jefferson's daughters, who ensured his comforts in his old age and made sure his legacies continued. I personally think this is my favorite book so far on the Jefferson women. I am enlightened now as to what his third daughter had endured when she left the plantation to be an independent woman. While Harriet still remains shrouded in the veils of history, Kerrison did her best to explain what Harriet had to endure as a slave, as an unrecognized daughter of Jefferson and what might have happened to her once she left the plantation with her older brother. Kerrison also devoted time to that time period where slaves would try to pass for white especially if they were lighter-skinned. It covers a sensitive subject that still resonates even today, 200 years after the Revolution. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone who is interested in history."}, {"userName": "Cherei", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5171527-cherei", "userReview": "I read this book slowly.. as I wanted time to research a few items that I'd read. OMG! The author outdid herself. This has to be one of the best researched novels of Jefferson's daughters. If you've read, \"First Daughter\".. then, this book is a MUST read. You will gain insights that you would not have even thought of prior to reading this story. It's a standalone novel.. you do not need to do prior reading.. but, it does help you understand the Jefferson family and their role in forming this country!I did not realize that his \"wooded\" retreat was three days from Monticello. Everyone else made out like it was just a few miles in the woods. Jefferson's architectural building concepts were so far ahead of his time.. it's not funny. Though, I found it very odd that he chose to give himself the best lit rooms.. and then, locked the library. To visit his sanctuary was by permission only. An absolute treat for the mind!

Martha, the oldest, was educated in France during her father's long period of residence there. She benefitted from the coursework at her elite Parisian school, which was not meant to prepare her as an \u201cornamental\u201d wife, as was the goal in the US, but was meant to prepare young women with the knowledge to enter into philosophical and political discussions in the salons of Europe. She thrived, but unfortunately she returned to rural Virginia when her father's tenure in Paris ended. Gone were the intellectual stimulation, and her only outlet became the education of her own daughters and sons. This included fluency in French, Spanish, and Latin, which was a subject only boys were taught. For all Jefferson's talk of \u201cequality\u201d and his love of books and knowledge, he was completely negligent in applauding and utilizing the exceptional minds of his daughters. Needlepoint, music, art, French, manners, and of course household management were encouraged rather than science, math, philosophy, economics, or rhetoric. At the end of the day, Martha's daughters were the most educated women of the period, but unfortunately, the US at this time did not recognize the importance of education for women. Martha's younger sister, Maria, died at the age of thirty-five due to the complications of childbirth, but she only spent 2-3 years in Paris, and was not as indoctrinated in the culture of learning. She had one son who survived childhood, but he was very young when she died. At the other end of the social ladder was Harriet Hemings Jefferson. Her education was focused on learning a trade so that when she was freed at the age of twenty-one, she could find work. However, because Sally Deming's daughter and three sons worked in Monticello home, they were exposed to the culture, mannerisms and lessons of the of the upper class, and they absorbed the behaviors like sponges. Although Harriet did not learn to write until adulthood, her brothers learned by watching, and as they entered the world outside of slavery, they could read and write. Besides the differences in the education and living conditions of the three sisters, the author provided extensive background information on the practice of \u201cpassing\u201d, which all four of Sally Hemings's children chose to do, rather than become \u201cfreed slaves\u201d, and there intelligence and perseverance allowed them to achieve success. Occasionally the author seemed to repeat information, but since I was reading a Net galley, courtesy of Random House, this might not be the case in the final, and it wasn't that much of a distraction. I was engrossed in the story, and would definitely recommend for students of history, both casual and professional. It is a perfect fit for courses in women's studies, and US history, both cultural and political, and as a character study of Thomas Jefferson. Once again, in my opinion, he comes up short.I can't help but wonder if Martha's and Sally's outcomes would have been different if they had remained in France. Sally's living conditions would surely have been better, and any daughters Martha might have had the educational opportunities they deserved. This is a strong contender for my book club the next time I host."}, {"userName": "Jo Ann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/227587-jo-ann", "userReview": "This was a very intriguing read for me, and served to inform me more about the mores, values, educational opportunities (and lack thereof), in both Jefferson's time, and for Jefferson in particular. All 3 daughters, and the man himself, were certainly impacted by societal expectations and prejudices. I knew quite a bit about Martha, little about Maria, and almost nothing about Harriet, whose mother was Sally Hemings. We still do not know much about Harriet...much of what the author writes about her is conjecture, based on the times. I know we'll never know more, but I wish we did. While I loved reading about the 3 daughters, what continues to amaze me are the discrepancies between what Jefferson said he believed, and what he acted (or didn't act) upon. For instance, he loved his family...I truly believe he loved his 2 girls from Martha, and loved Martha. But, as we look at his planning of Monticello, he was more enamored with himself and his own comforts, relegating even his loved ones to poor, dark, small rooms, while he basked in the beautiful rooms for himself. He will remain an enigma to me, and this book served only to solidify that enigma!"}, {"userName": "Bridget Vollmer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34658266-bridget-vollmer", "userReview": "I received this book in a GR giveaway in exchange for my review.This I my first book I've read pertaining to Jefferson' daughters.I thought Catherine Kerrison did a wonderful job not only describing the very different lives of the three sisters but also daily life, education, and the social environment of that time period.

In fact I'm somewhat shocked this was even printed in 2018. The information included is dated, inaccurate, and slavery apologist in tone.This biography while extremely approachable is heavily and not respectfully edited in respect to chattel slavery. This biography includes 2 white women who exploited enslaved peoples and one enslaved person. The enslaved person is presented as a labor exempt 'worker'. If an author is too fragile to acknowledge that enslaved peoples were never 'workers' it doesn't bode well for the text. The white women are never once clearly identified as slave owners.I know very little about the everyday life, personal thoughts, expectations, customs and manners of southern white chattel-slave owning women during this time period so that's interesting. The clothing, education and socialization expectations are all new and a fascinating addition to what I know about British and French women of comparable class and social standing. The featured exchanges between Martha and her contemporaries at her French Boarding School over their lifetimes is enlightening. Ms Kerrison mentions Annette Gordon-Reed's groundbreaking research into The Hemings Family with great respect but seems to use the facts provided therein minimally and to flat effect. Gone is the verbose richness and detail of setting which highlight the recounting of the histories of Martha and Maria Jefferson and their families/contemporaries. There seems to be a bare bones, almost outline approach with facts connected but barely fleshed out with appropriate period detail. Not many facts are known about any of these women and their lives but a much richer narrative is created for Martha and Maria. Also as this is published in 2018 by a Professor of History and Women & Gender Studies, I expected the current verbiage of 'enslaved peoples', which is now considered moderately standard in academia. Those expectations were in vain. Worse yet Kerrison actually adds the title 'slave' to various enslaved peoples and never once the title 'slave owner' in referencing the multiple slave owning white people in this book. Example: 'Slave Isaac Jefferson...' Whereas Thomas Jefferson is never once referred to as 'Slave Owner Thomas Jefferson...' While this treatment of enslaved peoples is not uncommon in historians who heavily study white 'slave owners', it's still blatantly biased and a racist treatment of enslaved peoples. There exist centuries of historical precedent to ignore, dismiss and downplay the evils of chattel slavery in biographies of slave exploiting white people. This text includes no mention of the methods white women used to exploit enslaved labor nor typical punishments enacted by white women towards enslaved people, especially those in the house. The author tries to insulate Martha and Maria from any hint of the exploitation that made up their normal daily lives. They exploited enslaved peoples who they also held in captivity for their labor, this is never even indirectly addressed. It's bizarre. If I'm reading about this period in the UK about women of comparable class the roles of servants would be prominent as well as the names of personal attendants. This lack results in the inclusion of inaccurate information about the lives and skills of Martha and Maria. For example it's highly doubtful Martha or Maria had more than a theoretical knowledge of cooking and household management as we understand these chores today. Household/exploited (slave) labor management would largely have been handled first by Betty Hemings and then likely by Sally. White wives and daughters on plantations like these planned menus and read aloud recipes to enslaved women, who already knew the recipes by heart.White women who had that much exploited labor at their disposal across multiple plantations didn't 'do' much of anything. That is, after all, the main purpose of stealing, oppressing and exploiting whole families of people-a desire to NOT labor yourself. These women didn't labor beyond child birth. They didn't suffer want or privation no matter how strained their circumstances. The system of forced labor that was chattel slavery existed expressly so white women of this class could have no real expectations of labor either mental or physical.These women weren't even responsible for their own kids. They didn't breastfeed, change diapers, stay up at night with unsleeping babies/toddlers/kids and would only have been minimally involved even in the care of sick children. Enslaved women would have provided the vast majority of the care and discipline for Martha's large brood of kids. None of this is mentioned or detailed.The narratives of enslaved peoples in the US feature white women directly oppressing enslaved peoples, especially women working in the house. White women were often instigators of slave punishments, the sale of individuals away from their families and the sale of enslaved children fathered by white men. These white women had an active, not passive nor spectator role during this time period. This well documented history is completely missing from this narrative with the exception of single story in which a daughter of Martha personally whips an enslaved women.These facts are left out because the author wishes to distance Martha and Maria Jefferson from their harmful and exploitative behaviors. These women lived and breathed exploitation and oppression. Biographers must effectively place their subjects in their appropriate historical place and time. Ms Kerrison has published multiple non-fiction histories/texts on the lives, expectations, customs, education and hobbies of southern slave owning white women during this time period. Clearly she is aware of the role these women played in slavery, that she would choose to edit that from a biography about white female slave owners is concerning. This unfortunately calls into question the validity of all of the information provided in this text, as it clearly is heavily edited to reflect the author's own bias, prejudices and racism."}, {"userName": "John Findlay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22770246-john-findlay", "userReview": "While I was aware of the Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings relationship and that he fathered several children by her, this book fills in many details that I did not know. And it also depicts the very privileged lives of his two legitimate daughters, Martha and Maria. But women clearly play a very limited role in the early days of our country, being deprived of a full education and the ability to control their own destiny. To ensure their futures, they needed to find an appropriate husband, and their educations were geared towards being good conversationalists, rather than earning a living or contributing to politics. Of course, slavery was even worse, and one of Jefferson's daughters has the double curse of being both a woman and a slave. I was unaware of the fact that Sally Hemings and Jefferson's wife were half-sisters, or that Sally Hemings was 3/4 white. Her children by Jefferson were 7/8 white, yet were still considered black slaves. Their relationship started after Jefferson's wife had died and extracted a promise from him that he would not remarry. Sally could have stayed in Paris, after Jefferson was recalled, and become a free woman, but chose to return to America with Jefferson with an understanding that her children would live in freedom. Several of the children were not formally released from slavery, but were just allowed to \"run\" and to then pass as white. I especially enjoyed the last section of the book as Kerrison tries to uncover what may have happened to Harriet Hemings from the sparse information available. As with several books I have read about Thomas Jefferson, I was left with the feeling that he should not be as revered as he is. While he wrote beautiful words, he did not believe \"all men are created equal\" extended to black men, or to women in general. After finishing the book, I wish Borglum had found someone else to honor on Mt. Rushmore.

Fortunately, the book got better as it went along, and it had interesting information about Jefferson and his white and black offspring, as well as facts about the role of women and of blacks in American society from the 1700s through today. As has been outlined in other books I have read, Jefferson treated Sally Hemings, his mistress; their children; and Sally's other relatives, who made up most of the house slaves at Monticello, much better than his other slaves. Still they were slaves, existing under his control. Jefferson never acknowledged his slave children (even though some plantation owners did) and never officially freed his slave children. He just let them slip away from Monticello, mostly into freedom living as whites. Jefferson, who penned the phrase \"all men are created equal,\" kept people in bondage until his dying day.

While it started off very well and was completely captivating, the last third of the book ended in endless repetition. (That's got to be some sort of logical fallacy.) So here we have the story of Jefferson's three daughters Martha, Maria, and Harriet. In the beginning, we get lots of detail on Martha because he life is so well documented. Maria's brief life was a bit less so. While Martha and Maria are his daughters born to his wife Martha Wayles, Harriet is his daughter by his slave Sally Hemings. Because of that, Harriet leads a life that is almost completely unknown for very reasons that Kerrison does a great job at laying out. The book does an excellent job of laying out the status of men, women, and slaves during the era. I especially liked the descriptions of the architecture of Monticello and how it clearly demonstrated those differences. Where the book falls down is at the end. Kerrison runs out of ways to say \"we don't know\" when describing what is unknown about about Harriet's life. Kerrision then spends much time going over the same points on status again and again. It felt almost as if I were hearing the same sentences over and over again. The end of this book really needed a good editing and tightening up. It was so bad, I kept losing the narrative.For the most part (the first 3/4s), this book was great.

I come from the upper Midwest and was not familiar with either Southern ways nor racial diversity. I chose to read this book because I was interested in the lives of women in the post Revolutionary era. Professor Kerrison examines the live of 3 very different women. Martha and Maria are the daughters of Thomas Jefferson and his wife Martha. Harriet Hemings is Jefferson's daughter by slave Sally Hemings. Eldest daughter Martha traveled with Jefferson to France where she was educated in a convent school. Besides the typical studies of music, dance and needlework, the sisters taught Martha in subjects more frequently reserved for young men. Social contact with Jefferson's political and personal acquaintances introduced her to many educated, sophisticated, politically aware women. She grew into a woman who loved reading and the accumulation of knowledge. Younger daughter Maria stayed with relatives for the majority of Jefferson's time in Paris. She stayed with a family where she was loved, coddled and schooled in the traditional role of a Southern plantation owners wife. She joined her sister and father in Paris for a short time but was resistant to education in languages, literature, mathematics and geography. Sally accompanied the Jefferson's to Paris and returned with them after exacting a promise from Jefferson that their children would be freed from slavery at adulthood. Harriet and was raised as an upper level slave with freedoms not enjoyed by other household slaves. She was eventually trained in the skill of spinning. Author Kerrison adroitly incorporated known facts about these three women with blanks filled in by describing the typical lives of women in their place in society, often positing several possibilities of action. Her narratives present an interesting study of their lives, roles in society and the general attitudes toward women in different levels of society. After marrying a suitable but not very robust or successful man, Martha directed her love of learning to educating her many children and assisting her rather remote father. Maria, on the other hand, married a loving, successful man and happily lived the life of a planter's wife. Her marriage was plagued with stillborn children and poor health. She died in childbirth leaving one son and a grieving widower. Little is know of Harriet's life beyond a few bare facts but Kerrison describes well the life of an upper slave in that era. She came from a large and loving family. As she approached the age where she would be freed, according to Sally's bargain with Jefferson, she left her family and the plantation...possibly with the assistance of her brother and to a small degree Jefferson himself. She vanished into the Washington (DC) area where, later accounts tell us, she passed for white, married and had a family. She, perhaps, had the happiest life of all three of Jefferson's daughters.I loved the descriptions of the everyday lives of these three women. I was fascinated by information on the political climates, emerging philosophies concerning women's roles and rights, and on the eye-opening slave culture in the post Revolutionary US. I felt badly for these three women who were locked into the cultures in which they were born and wished I could reach back in time to tell them that some things will change and that, sadly, other things haven't."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14070102-nicole", "userReview": "First of all, I disliked this book because the author uses the phrases they \"would have\" or she \"may have\" or he \"probably\" so many times its infuriating. She's basically saying she has no idea what actually happened, but here's what was happening in society at the same time. It's completely pointless!On the other hand, it's hard to find women in the history back then. Men are just so much more visible - women disappear, especially when they die young or are enslaved. So she didn't really have a lot to work with.The parts about Harriet are pure conjecture. There's literally nothing in there that the author can state as fact. Finally, the book kind of made me hate Jefferson for thinking so little of women and dedicating so little time and energy to their education.Overall, a very frustrating read."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050732-julie", "userReview": "Received an ARC via NetGalleyThis book has a good number of paintings and photos of what the author discusses. The author has a lot of bibliographic information and notes at the end of the book if you want to do more reading/research. The completed book is supposed to have a family tree and map, which I think would have greatly helped me keep track of everybody and where they are located. I also would have liked a timeline. The author went back and forth on dates a lot and sometimes I would get confused. I think that the person that would really like the book is someone who has read a lot of American History of the late 1700s and earlier 1800s as well as social history of women. Heads Up: there are a lot of Marthas in this so you have to pay attention to keep track of them. The author often says \u2018perhaps she\u2019 and \u2018maybe she\u2019 because even though she has done a lot of research there is no concrete proof for a lot of the actions/feelings of the women of that time."}, {"userName": "Pam Lindholm-levy", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2244675-pam-lindholm-levy", "userReview": "Thomas Jefferson had three daughters who lived to adulthood, two, Martha and Maria with his wife, and one with his slave and concubine (not sure about that word, but mistress implies he was married), Sally Hemings. Martha had an excellent education in Paris, Maria came over later and was not a diligent student. Sally worked in the large house and came home pregnant with the first of her children with Jefferson.Martha and Maria lived the lives of Virginia planter wives. Sally had made a pact with Jefferson in Paris that their children would be freed from slavery when they reached age 21. We know all this.New to me, and interesting, was that Martha, besides having 12 children eventually and running her father's household---her husband was always off trying to make money and being in the Virginia legislature---she gave her daughters the same excellent education she had had. The writer wonders at length whether this education, more like what young men of the time had, was helpful to the daughters. They were at the same time being raised to be wives, mothers, and slave owners. The daughters indeed did grow up feeling entitled, and certainly had little to do as they got older, with Jefferson's other daughter, Harriet Hemings, whom he put to work in his fabric mill at age 14 there at Monticello. There is no record of Harriet in Jefferson's meticulous record keeping except as a slave. But he kept his vow to Sally, that Harriet (and her brothers) would be free at age 21. But all he noted was that she \"run.\" As if she were a fugitive.The writer's chapter on Harriet's possible life in Washington D.C., where there is no Harriet Hemings in the municipal records, was thorough. Harriet was 7/8 white, enough to \"pass,\" and was said to be beautiful like her mother. It appears that she did pass, and disappeared from history. This chapter, and the writer's searching for \"Harriets\" was so interesting, and made the reader know how invested in Jefferson's Daughters she was. Let's hope someday Harriet turns up in history, just like the fact of her and her brothers actually being Jefferson's children finally turned up and was acknowledged by historians who had wanted to keep denying it."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1135996-rhonda", "userReview": "Although i found Professor Annette Gordon-Reed\u2019s books about the family of Sally Hemmings and their relationship to Thomas Jefferson more engaging than this book, I appreciated the perspectives presented about the entitled lives of his daughters Martha and Maria Jefferson and that of their unacknowledged half-sister / cousin Harriet Hemings. Simply fascinating. And heartbreaking, for even the \u201clegitimate\u201d sister Maria who may have had some abolitionist leanings, put these handily aside when the economics of running her husband\u2019s properties and maintenance of their genteel southern lifestyle became the higher priority. I was also much persuaded of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s narcissism, whether displayed in the design of his home Monticello, his treatment of his young girls Martha and Maria and consideration of their needs, his likely rape of the teenage Sally Hemmings in Paris (I don\u2019t think anyone would seriously call it a seduction or affair), or his choice to obtain, retain and barter other humans, specifically his enslaved \u201cfamily\u201d on Monticello. The fact that his lavish lifestyle left Martha and others to \u201cpay the price\u201d upon his death illustrated to me the magnitude of that narcissism and the limits of his wisdom, empathy and ethics. I was intrigued by the author\u2019s suggestion that Harriet\u2019s choice to \u201cpass\u201d as white when allowed to leave Monticello was a transgressive act, bringing to mind bell hooks and her theories. Reading the book, sometimes a slow endeavor, brought the reward of glimpsing the author\u2019s essential commitments, morally and ethically in terms of the role of women in society. However, I would much like to read a response from an African American womanist perspective, especially theological. All in all, I applaud the author for her commitment to the difficult task of creating this story of lives considered far less valuable than their paterfamilias, lives far more difficult to research and reveal. I am so glad the author stayed the course in the endeavor and gave to us this book."}, {"userName": "Brandi D'angelo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22139378-brandi-d-angelo", "userReview": "Jefferson's Daughters is chock full of history, not only about Jefferson's daughters, but of the time period, customs, education, social etiquette, work, and more. One of the main themes is that of slavery. Author Catherine Kerrison does a fine job of delving into the hard telling of the history of slavery, how it affected woman in particular, and how its effects are still woven into life as we know it today. The story centers around 3 of Jefferson's daughters, two of which are white and the third is mostly black and a slave. The reader learns how completely different lives are led, depending on your skin color. Slavery was a really tough life, not only in the actual work, but in how you were treated in regards to your clothing, housing, time with family etc. It is awful. I was mesmerized by the description of nail-making in the chapter entitled, \"Harriet's Monticello.\" She describes how boys as young as 10 were put to work in the nailery, where it was brutally hot, especially in the summertime. They would hold iron in the fire until it was hot enough, and then swung a hammer, repeatedly, until it was shaped into a nail. Sometimes, a boy could yield 1000 nails in a 14-hour work day. Wow, a 14-hour work day. A lesser, but still prominent theme, was that of white women, told thru the story of Jefferson's two white daughters. While they were afforded lovely clothes, rich food, education, travel, etc., they still did not end up with the kinds of riches, property, and rights that men did. Women have come a long way, baby!Regardless of skin color, life was difficult and arduous back then. So many births ended in deaths, and it didn't matter how much money you had. So many people died of disease (typhus, measles, whooping cough) and infection. I like how the book ended, encouraging people to continue to pursue the inalienable rights that the founding fathers wrote about. So true!! We have to keep working, together, to build on that legacy."}, {"userName": "Marti", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2259573-marti", "userReview": "Jefferson\u2019s Daughters by Catherine Kerrison was a unusual choice for me to read. It was historically researched nonfiction, that relied on the many accounts of the time period to help fill in gaps. Despite my trepidation of the genre, I was fascinated enough to pick up and completely read the book. I found myself intrigued by the contradictions that made up Thomas Jefferson and how he treated his daughters. Thomas Jefferson had three daughters that survived past childhood. Two of his daughters, Martha and Mary were from his marriage to Martha Wayles Skelton. Harriet Hemings, his youngest daughter was born to Sally Hemings and was one of four (six, but two died in while babies) children fathered by Jefferson. The book enumerates the life of Martha, Mary and Harriet. Martha, Mary and Harriet\u2019s upbringing and education were separate as Harriet was enslaved. From childhood, to marriage, and to their death (or disappearance), their lives were described and put into context for the times. Catherine Kerrison\u2019s research and thoroughness shows within the writing of the book. At time, the book does delve into some subjects deeply, which interestingly did not detract from the book.Jefferson\u2019s Daughters is a long book. It is relatively easy to read, but its thoroughness does require attention and thought. Catherine Kerrison\u2019s research of the time does help the reader understand the times that the daughter\u2019s lived in. Jefferson\u2019s Daughters is a good nonfiction book, that brings the time period and the daughter\u2019s lives to the reader."}, {"userName": "Farfoff", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2010161-farfoff", "userReview": "There were a lot of things I did like in this book, but I found it hard to read. The pace is slow and it was too long -- I skimmed the last bits. I liked the way the Jefferson wasn't really the center of the book -- this is really about the women and less about him. She does tell us enough history to set the story + the women's place in it. I love that the author spends time talking about small pox inoculations and the Philadelphia balloon launch, etc. I found it hard to follow in time and hard to keep track of all the names -- there was a family tree at the beginning of the book, but I almost needed one printed out. There is lots of talk of architecture, houses, and moving between them. Keeping track of the names of houses on top of the names of people became difficult for me. A map might have helped -- again, maybe I needed to print it out. I found moving forward and backward in time and trying to keep track of which sister was where when was difficult. A timeline might have helped. AND: it is no Warmth of Other Suns -- there is a lot of speculation and discussion of how things \"must have been\" -- I almost would have preferred a little bit of story telling in there to make it come alive. I would recommend this along side other books if you happen to enjoy reading about this period in American History. It fit nicely with a couple of other books I read on the era recently."}], "description": "The remarkable untold story of Thomas Jefferson's three daughters - two white and free, one black and enslaved - and the divergent paths they forged in a newly independent America.\nThomas Jefferson had three daughters: Martha and Maria by his wife, Martha Wayles Jefferson, and Harriet by his slave Sally Hemings. In Jefferson's Daughters, Catherine Kerrison, a scholar of early American and women's history, recounts the remarkable journey of these three women - and how their struggle to define themselves reflects both the possibilities and the limitations that resulted from the American Revolution. Although the three women shared a father, the similarities end there. Martha and Maria received a fine convent school education while they lived with their father during his diplomatic posting in Paris - a hothouse of intellectual ferment whose celebrated salonni\u00e8res are vividly brought to life in Kerrison's narrative. Once they returned home, however, the sisters found their options limited by the laws and customs of early America. Harriet Hemings followed a different path. She escaped slavery - apparently with the assistance of Jefferson himself. Leaving Monticello behind, she boarded a coach and set off for a decidedly uncertain future. For this groundbreaking triple biography, Kerrison has uncovered never-before-published documents written by the Jefferson sisters when they were in their teens, as well as letters written by members of the Jefferson and Hemings families. She has interviewed Hemings family descendants (and, with their cooperation, initiating DNA testing) and searched for possible descendants of Harriet Hemings.The eventful lives of Thomas Jefferson's daughters provide a unique vantage point from which to examine the complicated patrimony of the American Revolution itself. The richly interwoven story of these three strong women and their fight to shape their own destinies sheds new light on the ongoing movement toward human rights in America - and on the personal and political legacy of one of our most controversial Founding Fathers.", "title": "Jefferson's Daughters: Three Sisters, White and Black, in a Young America", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34859714-jefferson-s-daughters", "average": 3.72, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492222278l/34859714.jpg", "reviews": 121, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/301756.Catherine_Kerrison", "name": "Catherine Kerrison"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Biography", "Historical", "North American Hi..."], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34859714-jefferson-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36106943-jefferson-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34925192-jefferson-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/549387.Claiming_the_Pen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23282380-virginia-women", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
