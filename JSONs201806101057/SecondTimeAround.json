The ten years following their college graduation have not been the easiest or the happiest for any of the girls. They are determined to get it right this time. When one of the girls buys their home during the college years, the girls discover that you can go home again. The money that Arden left them is just what they needed to get their lives back on track. Second Time Around is a well written novel with real and engaging characters. You learn to adore the girls and root for their success. Whether it be for their happy marriage or successful careers, you WANT to see them succeed. I thoroughly enjoyed Second Time Around. The camaraderie and friendship is something that Beth Kendrick writes well and all women can relate to. I look forward to reading more from Beth Kendrick.http://charlotteswebofbooks.blogspot...."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7475151-jessica", "userReview": "I am usually very easy to please when it comes to books and I never say I dislike one, but this book did not meet my expectations to what I thought it would be. There are several characters in this book and up to the very ending, I had a rather difficult time keeping track of each one. Although the characters all melded well with one another, their stories were weak and not fully formed. In order to completely understand each character there would have need to be more details about their lives.The story has very random points that never actually get into completion. Many things happen to each character, though we never truly see how they end up for them.The ending was rushed and left many questions still unanswered. Despite the cliches and the rather predictable scenarios, there was a good morale to the story. It is rather a shame to see that it's compilation was rather choppy and chaotic."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2771351-kimberly", "userReview": "Four former-roommates come into a lot of money when their fifth friend dies of lupus. The money arrives just as their respective lives are falling apart, so they all end up together in a small town in their old dorm, which one of the girls is transforming into a B&B with her share of the money.There are the typical chick-lit cliches (and I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying this): each girl finds her ideal man, each girl is a terrific success at what she chooses to do, and the theme of \"college friendship is forever\" is almost nauseatingly strong.However, there are a great many chick-lit cliches that are not in this book.

Five women, friends since college, get together for a mini-reunion once a year. One dies, leaving a million dollars to be split between the rest. The catch? They need to use the money to follow their dreams.Each woman has a job she doesn't love. Each has a seemingly impossible dream. The money gives those dreams a chance. While changing their careers, the women are forces to deal with personal problems ranging from guilt over accepting their dead friend's money, infertility, poor choices in love and one is haunted by a secret she has kept for over a decade.Second Time Around is full of fun and sorrow, potential and regret, hope and fear. It really makes the reader question what they would change in their lives if given $250,000. Imagine the possibilities. The enduring friendship of the four women left mourning their friend is inspirational, a wonderful example of what friendship between women should be.Beth Kendrick has written a book that does what all books should do. She put ideas in my head. She made me consider my life. She gave me something to think about. The message that life is too short to waste time on things you don't love is an important one and it couldn't have been written more beautifully. Second Time Around is chick-lit that focuses on the whole of a woman, not just her romantic life. I would love to see more books of this nature and highly recommend Second Time Around to any woman willing to reexamine where her life is headed. Funny, entertaining and meaningful - Second Time Around hits the trifecta."}, {"userName": "Anissa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7538688-anissa", "userReview": "I picked this up because it's been sitting on my bookshelf for too long. It's chick-lit & for what it is, it's fine. I think I have officially outgrown this type of chick-lit. It felt very much like a Lifetime movie & by that I mean, you have your standard main characters & you know that it's going to end pretty tidily. There's nothing wrong with that in & of itself but I am beyond finding that very satisfying at this point. All other things being equal, I'd have rather read a Maeve Binchy novel.

I had read Kendrick's book Nearlyweds the summer of 2009 and absolutely loved it so I decided to try to win Second Time Around. And what do you know? I actually won it! Amazing.Now that you know how I came across this novel, let me tell you that I loved, loved, loved it. I had a gala event that I was planning for work this past weekend and reading this book was a fantastic escape. I was incredibly stressed out so the fact that I was able to focus on the characters and the story really shows how great this novel was. It was also a particularly delicious experience to read this book while laying in my hotel room bed the morning after the gala - massive weight off my shoulders, a great book, and an incredibly squashy and comfy bed. Heaven.If you've ever wondered what would happened if you had done something differently (and come on, who hasn't?), you'll really enjoy this book. These four friends get the chance to change their lives and, as cliched as this sounds, find happiness. Each of the four women have a chance for a mini do over in their lives when they inherit $250,000 and each of them handles it in different ways. The four friends are the key to this novel so I want to give a little peek into how they deal with their new situations.Brooke is the sensible one of the bunch who decided to stay in their college town and is working at the alumni office. When the money comes to her she decides to jump right in and do what she's always wanted.Cait is working as an English professor and is hoping for tenure. She's always wanted to write a novel but even with this money, she can't quite seem to take the chance. Suddenly her situation changes at the college she's teaching at and she finally runs out of excuses. Jamie is the wild girl who always does what she wants and everyone else be damned. Guys come and go and she seems to be content with her job as a bartender - until her boss refuses her time off and she quits. In typical Jamie fashion, she falls headlong into her dream job when she's visiting Brooke. Then there's Anna. She's the only married one of the four but things are not all sunshine and lollipops. She and her husband have been trying for a baby for years and it has finally taken a toll on their marriage. He has to go oversees for work so she decides it's a perfect time to visit with the girls at Brooke's place and it's there she rediscovers her passion for baking.This book has everything - laughing, crying, loving, fighting, playing, and thinking - and it's all wonderfully woven together. The characters are all well rounded and incredibly likeable. I like that none of the women are perfect because, really, who is? The great thing about having this many different characters is that there's usually one that you can really identify with. In my case it was Cait. I can't quite put my finger on why but hers was the story that I always enjoyed going back to. Not to say that I didn't like reading about the other women, because I did. I actually wanted to be friends with them. And I think that is a key thing. These women have a friendship that all other females envy. Ten years ago they met in college and have stayed in touch ever since. While they may be living in different parts of the country, they still manage to see each other at least once a year and always pick up where they left off. They're doing better than some of my friends and I and we're all (for the most part) in the same province! Hence, the envy.I also think the setting is key. The four friends are back in their college town, which is a quaint, stereotypical upstate New York college town. For me, this was the kind of place that I always thought of when I thought about going away to university. The cover also helped convey what the setting was going to be like as well. There's nothing like seeing some Muskoka chairs, one with books on it, surrounded by green space. I think there also may be some sort of deeper meaning behind the setting. Perhaps Kendrick had all the women end up in the same town they went to college in for a reason. I think it might be because that's when things started to change and they began to make \"real\" decisions for the first time. I may have gone waaaay too deep for this novel, but it's an interesting thought.I highly recommend this book because it really is everything that chick lit should be. Compelling female characters, great friendship, a little bit of romance, and a journey. Do you really need any more convincing? Find this novel in some way or another and read it. You won't regret it."}, {"userName": "Christina (Confessions of a Book Addict)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2418140-christina-confessions-of-a-book-addict", "userReview": "I was drawn to the premise immediately. A group of English majors and best friends who graduated ten years ago from a small liberal arts college meet every 4th of July to catch up. They discuss everything and anything, but mostly how they wish they had different jobs and perhaps didn't major in English. Arden, their wealthy friend from the group, is dying of lupus, which saddens this group of girls tremendously. A few months after their 4th of July get together, she passes on and leaves them each $250,000. But there is a stipulation. They must use this money to pay off their debt and pursue their real dreams, whether it be to become an event planner, a pastry chef, a novelist, or a bed and breakfast owner. Beth Kendrick's Second Time Around is like a fresh breath of air. While reading this entertaining novel, I enjoyed fantasizing about dropping everything and pursuing my own dreams if I were given a chance just like these women. This is a must read for anyone who is a fan of chick-lit and has ever pondered the important question of.........what if?What is so great about this novel is the simple fact that there are four women that are extremely relatable. There's Jamie who is a bartender and has traveled around the world serving up drinks. She never really sees things through. Then there's Brooke who is a southern belle and resident nice girl that works for the college they graduated from. Cait is an English professor that always falls for the wrong guy and Anna, a copywriter, who rarely works and is trying to conceive, but finds out she's infertile. Most women could relate to at least one of these characters; they were very realistic. Which leads me to another thing I enjoyed about this novel: friendship. Second Time Around illustrates true friendship and strong female characters that support each other through time times. I feel like this is rare in chick-list; there's always that one mean girl, but these four women got along swimmingly.I also enjoyed Kendrick's incorporation of classic literature. Since I, too, was an English major, I particularly liked the various allusions to Shakespeare or Dickens. I also liked that Kendrick put a quote before each chapter. It was a nice touch. However, you don't have to be an English nerd to appreciate this.My only issue with this novel is that things sometimes worked out too easily for the girls. It was rather unbelievable at times. Some of the girls didn't have to work too hard in order to achieve their dreams.....sometimes it fell into their laps. I also wasn't a fan of Cait's writing. She wanted to become an author and found herself writing a romance novel. Kendrick incorporated a few excerpts from her writing, which in theory sounds entertaining; however, I am not a fan of romance novels. At all. Personally, this drove me nuts, but if you are a fan, they you will appreciate this glimpse into Cait's writing.All in all, I felt this was an interesting summer read that makes you think about the fact that maybe it isn't too late to strive for some of the goals that were set in college. Anyone, not just English majors, will enjoy this novel and the premise. I mean comon'.......Who doesn't dream of dropping everything to chase after your dreams?"}, {"userName": "chippyvale", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5382311-chippyvale", "userReview": "Every year, a group of former English majors meet up to update each other on their lives. The book starts off with the premise that majoring in English equals to saddling oneself with school debts after one has graduated and unabling to find a decent job. This resonates throughout the entire novel; somewhere along the story, a hardware shop assistant by the name of Everett echoed that sentiment too whose major was philosophy. \"Fine arts major?\" \"Worse. Philosophy.\" He spread his arms out to encompass his realm of drywall and crowbars and PVC pipes. \"See where four years of Aristotle and Descartes'll get you?\" He held out his right hand. \"I'm Everett.\" Having had friends who major in English literature, I was all too familiar with that complaint. I was keen to know what the author had in mind to rectify that age-old grouse. Practicality in the book refers to majoring in Law (as seen on the first page of the novel) or Engineering. However, I was a lil bemused by the sudden \"windfall\" whereby each person inherited a whooping 250 grand. I won't say what the reason for the windfall was for fear of ruining the story for those who have yet to read it. It was pretty cliche. The money allowed the friends to have a \"second chance\" in life whereby each of them sought to chase after their dreams. For instance, one of the characters Brooke used her inheritance to purchase Henley House in order to refurbish it as a Bed & Breakfast; Jamie who quit her bartending job, turned into an event-planner. Her seemingly overnight success left me puzzled; if only that would happen in real life! Overall, it was a good and light-hearted read. There weren't any big surprises in the book; definitely a few twists and turns but nothing too major. As mentioned earlier, the novel started off with the premise that majoring in English is impractical, and it ended off with that theme in mind, albeit an optimistic one. It was like trying to assure readers that it matters not what major he or she chooses in college as long as he or she has a passion for it. With passion, comes potential. \"We may not always be practical, but we have infinite potential.\" - Anna.It's perfect for someone who's looking for a good pick-me-up read. ;)"}, {"userName": "Peebee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4658421-peebee", "userReview": "Your basic chick lit involving a bunch of college girlfriends.

So they get to live their dreams (sort of) by going back to their college town and starting businesses...a B&B (in the off-campus house where they all lived), event planning and bakery all synergistically keeping each other employed, and pissing off some people who would rather not see them come back to town. Not terribly deep writing but not terrible either, and everything works out with their lives in the end (except of course for the one who died in the beginning, although some of her issues get resolved posthumously.)
