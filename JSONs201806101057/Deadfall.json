Jeffrey now takes his pen to the zombie genre. From my experience, zombie novels can be as trite and plodding as their subject matter, or do something truly remarkable with their undead cast. Expectations are high.Amber Redgrave is a mercenary (or security consultant as she prefers), and we meet her on one of her assignments: being a bodyguard for a rich, old lady, standing in for ex SAS and ex partner, John. Following an unexpected turn of events, Amber speaks to John about the assignment, and via an accidental phonecall, learns of a bigger mission. John is due to join a team of top flight mercenaries to recover a couple of children from a band of kidnappers. The team is a man short, so Amber volunteers her services.And this is the first 22 pages!Before you can say Land of the Dead sucks, we're following Amber and her team (involving old flame John and sexist arsehole Eddie among others) into a mining village in the middle of nowhere in the search for the missing children.Already, this says something about the pace. The opening chapter is chock full of action, and literally the slight drop in pace to squeeze in the required set up is the only part without wall to wall action. Once Amber and her crew land at the village, the action never lets up. I mean NEVER, right until the last line. Even the subplot of two environmentalists quickly gets going. The couple infiltrate a laboratory in which they believe animal tests are being carried out. They stumble onto a lot more than spraying perfume in dogs' eyes! These two provide some of the most suspenseful moments of the book.I don't play many video games, but this book reads like an amalgamation of several successful titles. The scenes with the 100% suited and booted commandos are Call of Duty, with bullets, grenades, rockets and mines flying. Then we have the more intimate Resident Evil scenes, taking out zombies with a handgun in farmhouses and mine tunnels. Finally (and my favourite parts of the book) we have early Metal Gear Solid action, with the environmentalists avoiding guards and security cameras, hiding in bathrooms, manholes, etc. As a reader, I was holding my breath with the characters as they go through several close calls!The flaw with the book for me was the characterisation. Only the enviromentalists Lofty and Jill stood out as different. The mercenaries were all pretty much the same and were interchangeable, apart from the in your face attitude of Crazy Eddie. There was the opportunity of some real quirky characters to accompany Amber and John into the fray. The book did not spend enough time with the uncaring mastermind behind the zombie plague to really make the reader hate him. But then with a pace as blistering as Deadfall's would this gave slowed down the read?Jeffrey does some interesting things with the zombies in the last few chapters and throws in a bit of technical jargon that sat right with me. It was both believable and interesting and a good touch. And also, let's get this out of the way, Jeffrey does NOT play it safe with the gore. Zombies are going to be messy, and this book doesn't disappoint. Jeffrey takes particular detail in the difference between a fresh zombie and a well fermented zombie! A scene in the minds with the oldest and most damaged of the dead was a stand out for me, both disgusting and bizarre. Good stuff!In summary, while the deeper and more literary readers might turn up their noses, Deadfall has a lightning pace and zombies, zombies, zombies! Zombie fans will adore it. Horror and action fans will not be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Dylan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2101805-dylan", "userReview": "Zombies, and lots of them. What's not to like, eh?Amber Redgrave is a security consultant -- that's bodyguard to you and me -- who, after a disastrous assignment jumps at the opportunity of redeeming herself when a chance phone call offers her a place on a covert operation to rescue two child hostages. The plan is to helicopter into a remote wooded area where the hostages are being held in a disused mining village, release the children, and then get the hell out of there, all before sunrise. What ensues, however, is carnage in the form of reanimated corpses intent on only one thing: killing the mercenaries and eating their flesh.Shaun Jeffrey has taken an oft-used plot of people trapped by overwhelming numbers of zombies and breathed life into it -\u2013 proving that life can reside in the undead. The \"virus\" that brings these zombies back from the grave is a refreshing alternative to the usual methods of contamination, and serves as a positive means to push the story along while providing an important subplot.This novel is certainly not short of pace, as it zips along at breakneck speed with barely a chance to pause for breath between chapters. Amber is instantly likeable, and not just because she's a determined heroine who gives as good as she gets, but because we are allowed to see her vulnerable side in the form of failed relationships with her former lover and suicidal brother. Her constant battle for acceptance with Eddie, one of the mercenaries in the team, is what really pulls her character development along, and the way their relationship changes as the book hurtles towards its climax is a nice touch by the author.But the characters in Deadfall are, unfortunately, one area where the novel could have done with a bit more fleshing out (and there's already plenty of flesh in this book, both zombie flesh being shredded by bullets and human flesh being torn and consumed by the ravenous undead). Apart from Amber and Eddie -- and perhaps Lofty and his girlfriend Jill in that subplot that proves vital to the novel -- the other characters dropped into this precarious situation of fending off those monsters that cannot die seem to have as little life in them as the zombies themselves. Do they live or die? Who cares, it all adds to the body count. Maybe that's harsh, and it's not intended to be so, because at the end of it all Deadfall races along at such a pace, and is filled with so much splatter and gunfire and mutilation and an incredible plot twist that comes straight out of left field to slap you in the face with more force than a decomposing hand, that frankly all I cared about was Amber and her fight with Eddie and the zombies.When the dust settles and the gun smoke clears and all you're left with is the sweet stench of cordite and decaying flesh, you have to ask yourself what the ingredients are to make a good zombie novel become a great one. The answer is simple:1. Gore.2. An armory load of bullets and bombs.3. A high body count.Deadfall, by Shaun Jeffrey, ticks all these boxes and the result is one hell of a high octane, blood thirsty, seat-of-your-pants, wild ride."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "Full review on my blog: http://theaussiezombie.blogspot.comThis is one of the hardest reviews I\u2019ve ever written. When I first started reading Deadfall I had to push myself to keep reading. I nearly abandoned it several times, but something kept drawing me back \u2013 Mr. Jeffrey\u2019s writing skills. The first half of the book was action-packed but also a little bit too \u2018military ops\u2019 for my taste. I liked the main character, Amber, from the beginning. Tough, relentless, no-holds-barred chick with a \u2018tude \u2013 but for me Deadfall had a slow start, a little like treading water. I had a feeling the action was coming, but I was starting to get impatient. Amber\u2019s interactions with her \u2018partner\u2019 Eddie screamed sexism but had me sniggering with their tit-for-tat encounters.The zombies (and yes, I bought this book because it featured zombies!) took a little bit too long to arrive, and then just as background. But at the halfway mark Deadfall kicked up the action a full two stars. The zombies emerged from the darkness, Amber developed into an amazing character, and the seemingly secondary characters of Lofty and Jill occupied top billing.As the story kicks into top gear, I was hooked \u2013 the characters develop their third dimensions, the writing becomes enthralling and spine-tingling, and the climax left me guessing, and cheering for Amber, Lofty and Eddie.The added bonus of the alternative ending leaves Deadfall wide open for a sequel\u2026.is this another cliffhanger?(Loved the alternative ending too!)"}, {"userName": "Birgit", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4563598-birgit", "userReview": "Have you ever read a book that felt like you're in the middle of an action movie? If not, I've got some real sweet recommendations for you - books by Shaun Jeffery. This one in particular is about zombies, yes zombies, and while not everyone might like them, or the horror genre in general, you'll be in for a real treat if this is just your thing. In case you're not really into dead people trying to eat those who are still alive, maybe the feisty heroine Amber and her team of mercenaries will persuade you to give it a try after all. Fast paced, full of action, and really well written, I honestly couldn't put the book down. His description of characters and settings literally made the book come to live while reading.Last but not least I loved that the author added a different ending, the director's cut, so to say. Both are great, though I kinda prefer the one that made it.In short: A gripping book that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of the action - great movie potential and obviously a fantastic read!"}, {"userName": "Ginger Nuts ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1850764-ginger-nuts", "userReview": "Deadfall, the latest novel from The Kult author Shaun Jeffrey is is take on the zombie genre. Now before some of you sigh, I know who you are, and I generally feel the same as you but , this book goes swims against the tide and is a great zombie book.A team of mercenaries led by Amber Redgrave the feisty female heroine of the novel have been contracted to rescue two children being held hostage by rouge ex-soldiers. Unknown to the team this is a ruse and the real danger is far more horrific.On the flip side are a pair of eco warriors Jill and Lofty who by sheer chance, when they decide to check out a local test facility, end up helping out the team of mercenaries when the proverbial hits the fan.This is the second novel of Shaun's from Leucrota press, sees Shaun on full on action mode, to call this a zombie novel would be a great disservice to his writing. This is not a case of jumping on the zombie bandwagon, far far from it. Yes there is an army of stinking rotting reanimated corpses, yes the only sure fire way to kill them is a shot to the head. To me this was more of an adventure novel, like those of Jeremy Robinson and Jonathan Mayberry, than a horror novel, which in my humble opinion is a good thing. This novel deserves to read by a much wider audience than that of the mere zombie fan. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of gruesome and terrifying scenes for the discerning horror writer. I just feel there is so much more to this than a zombie novel.The action scenes are handled with great confidence, it is easy to see why Shaun has become one of my go to authors, even though this is only his third published novel, he has developed his own style of writing. Strong, and sleek with good well thought out characters. The Pages almost reek with the smell of cordite, blood and sweat. You can tell he has put a lot of effort into the research, the mercenaries feel real, and their characters are fleshed out so you really do care what happens to them, even if one or two of them are not exactly likeable. The conflict that arises within the group of mercenaries, due to the situation and the fact that all these testosterone jockies have to deal with a female leader.The darker moments of Deadfall and counterbalanced with some good comic light relief, a lot of which is provided by Lofty and Jill. These moments flow seamlessly into the narrative, without any sense shoehorning, which is no mean feat, as it is not easy to marry these two types of writing without it seeming forced. Nor are they there only for comic relief, lofty and Jill play a key role in the development of the plot, and play a major role in turning this from just being a another zombie tale, into an essential zombie novel.So to the zombies. To be honest, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of zombie novels, that I can truly say were any good. Shaun has put a lot of effort into creating his zombies, the reason for their existence is well thought out, and as believable as a zombie novel can be. The shambling dead are really well described, in all their rotting glory. And their creation plays a central role in the plot of the novel, both from the view points of Lofty and Jill and the team of mercenaries.One of the main problems with zombie novels is that it is very hard to have even the remotest upbeat ending, without giving anything away the final paragraph of brought a sly smile to my face. I think it was an apt finale for this book. It is also nice to see a zombie novel that doesn't involve the end of the world.This is a much more straight forward novel than Shaun's previous The Kult, (which by the way is also a great novel), here he swaps mystery and plot twists for a tightly written novel full of action and tension, which goes to show that Shaun can deftly turn his hand to more than one type of genre.Deadfall bucks the trend of really terrible zombie novels, so much so it makes all those hours wasted reading a truly awful zombie stories worthwhile. Even if you have become jaded and sick of zombie novels, pick up Deadfall, you will not be disappointedShaun's previous novel The Kult, is currently under going movie development, if anything Deadfall is even more suited to the movie treatment, with any luck some smart thinking producer will have read this and perhaps finally make a decent zombie film."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth A.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2146364-elizabeth-a", "userReview": "\"The usual principles of combat seemed useless when fighting an impervious enemy, an enemy that didn\u2019t need sleep and that functioned on the compulsion to kill, and she knew if they were to get out alive she had to adapt.\" \u2013 Amber RedgraveIf someone had told weapons specialist and ex-military member Amber \u201cBig Red\u201d Redgrave that a security assignment gone bad resulting in two deaths was going to be the best part of her day, she\u2019d probably have stayed in bed. Fortunately for readers of author Shaun Jeffrey\u2019s newest book, Deadfall, she didn\u2019t.Following the ill-fated security assignment that starts Deadfall off with a bang, Amber returns to the office for debriefing by agency owner and ex-SAS man, John Richmond. Though a lucrative and time sensitive matter has arisen, given the morning\u2019s events he doesn\u2019t want Amber involved and insists that she take some time to decompress.Amber, however, wants to get right back into things, so when she takes a call from the client indicating that they need an additional team member she talks herself onto the mission team\u2026 without Richmond\u2019s knowledge. Understandably, he is not pleased to see Amber later that day at the mission rendezvous point. It being too late to replace her, he begrudgingly accepts her presence.The eight man team is informed that their mission is to rescue the client\u2019s two children, who have been kidnapped. Though the wealthy client is willing to pay the ransom, he\u2019s not convinced the kidnappers will actually release the kids even if he does. Therefore, having learned that the kidnappers are hiding out in a remote, abandoned mining village he wants the team to go in and get the kids back before the 24 hour ransom deadline expires. A classic insertion and rescue mission, right?Not quite. Instead of finding the kidnappers and missing kids in the village, they find it eerily quiet and seemingly quite empty. That is until hundreds of people start pouring out of the abandoned mine shaft and begin attacking the team. As they try to repel the assault they notice that the people are not slowing down, let alone dying, despite being shot\u2026 unless it\u2019s a head shot. Impossible as it seems, the team quickly realizes that they aren\u2019t dealing with living people, but with the undead. And we\u2019re not talking Night of the Living Dead shuffling, slow moving zombies. No, these are the 28 Days Later chase you down speedy kind of zombies, and the resulting fight by the team to stay alive and get back to civilization is a white-knuckled ride with gore aplenty.But there\u2019s more going on in Deadfall than just a good zombie romp. In addition to having to deal with scores of the undead, there\u2019s the question of exactly who their client really is and why they were set up, as well as the realization that not all the team members are who they seem to be. Further, Jeffrey has given a unique twist to the origin of the zombies in Deadfall, one that is both believable and allows for an ending that manages to simultaneously wrap things up and leave them open, in equally satisfying measures.First with The Kult and now with Deadfall, Shaun Jeffrey is quickly establishing himself as the \u2018go to\u2019 guy for high-intensity action. Having already demonstrated that he can write both traditional crime fiction and horror with equal skill, I can\u2019t wait to see what Jeffrey serves up next!"}, {"userName": "Lorraine Versini", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5808310-lorraine-versini", "userReview": "Wowzers.Just from seeing the cover, I just knew this was a book for me. It just freaks me out. Yet I was still curious, bit like when you're watching a horror movie and you've got your hands in front of your eyes but you're still peeping between your fingers, that kind of feeling. So that's why I decided this book would be next in line after reading The Kult and acquiring all of Shaun's other Ebooks.This is definitely one of those \"can't put it down\" books. I just had to know what was happening next.The plot is extremely fast-paced. The whole story covers just over 24 hours, and is packed with action and suspense. There isn't a single \"dead moment\", and the reader gets drawn into the story right from the start. But what I thought made this book totally awesome, is how it was a totally different experience to watching zombie movies (zombie book virgin I was until I read this one). It's a complete experience for the reader. One that involves all the senses. Sight and hearing obviously. But also touch, taste, smell, through the cleverly written descriptions. The reader is a witness to the scenes, but also feels like the characters. Nothing is left to imagination, every single detail is included. Well apart from what actually rotting zombie flesh smells like, but still, I just guess it's pretty close to chicken that's gone off if not worse.As usual, you can expect the unexpected twist when you expect it the least. And expect to not have any idea about the end. Because it won't end the way you're thinking it will. Or maybe it will, but that's after you've thought about every single exit scenario. Gosh Shaun's books totally mess up with your brain...A smashing read. Loved it. Gore galore, a plot that is not actually that far-fetched for a zombie story, and manages to distance itself from the usual \"experiment gone wrong\" kind of story, and twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Not the happiest book in the world, but when you are dealing with zombies, who really expects it?I received a copy of this book through the Goodreads giveaway."}, {"userName": "Timo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10136036-timo", "userReview": "I didn't like it and given the good reviews here it was a huge disappointment. The author's writing style is repetitive (\"did i just read this couple pages earlier?\") and therefore quite numbing. Also this book offers nothing new to the vast array of zombie books."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1429106-amy", "userReview": "I love zombie stories and the concept of creating a zombie army made for an interesting story. I can really see it as a zombie movie and/or video game.

Wasn't great, didn't suck. Few characters had much development past a few lines. Still not sure who a few of them were, other than zombie fodder."}], "description": "A team of mercenaries race to an abandoned mining village to rescue two children held hostage by rogue ex-soldiers. But the kidnappers are a ruse, the real threat more terrifying than any of them could imagine. Aided by a couple of unsuspecting eco-warriors, mercenary team leader Amber Redgrave must fight to survive against foes that don't sleep and don't feel pain. Now as the body count rises, so do the stakes, and when the dead won't stay dead, there's going to be hell to pay.", "title": "Deadfall", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7540697-deadfall", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347518909l/7540697.jpg", "reviews": 28, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1003944.Shaun_Jeffrey", "name": "Shaun Jeffrey"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7540697-deadfall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10876422-deadfall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17823814-deadfall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6393198-the-kult", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13495087-the-mutilation-machination", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9369354-dead-man-s-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12835602-killers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13502062-dead-world"]}
