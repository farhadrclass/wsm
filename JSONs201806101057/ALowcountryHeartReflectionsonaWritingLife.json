Pat Conroy was one of them and I would so have loved to meet him in person, envy those who have. I feel this loss of opportunity and the loss of this fabulous author even more so after having read this wonderful collection of blog entries, speeches and of course his eulogy. There is so much humor, his admiration for other authors and yes he names them, the state of publishing today, his history in the Citadel, basketball, his friends, his family, the editors he has had the privilege to work with and along side. So much, his wife the author Cassandra King. His wit, his intelligence, his humanity and his love for his home shines through. Regrets, sorrows, joys, one definitely gets the full range of characteristics that made him the special person he was.I have read all his books but two, one nonfiction on his writing life and his cookbook, which I didn't know about. Was intruded to new authors I now want to search out and read. I am so glad this has been published, a last glimpse of a great author and very human man.ARC from publisher."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "What I love about Pat Conroy is how he wore his heart on his sleeve. He seemed to love everybody, and he would tell you so. He loved the South, he loved his family and friends, he loved his readers, and he also loved books. A Lowcountry Heart is a posthumous collection of writings from Conroy, who died a year ago this month. The book includes speeches he's made, his \"letters\" that were posted online (Conroy didn't like the term blog), some magazine articles and interviews, and very touching tributes from his longtime friends and wife. Reading this was a lovely way to remember the author.I listened to this on audio, and I enjoyed most of the pieces. There were a few writings that were a bit confusing because I haven't read enough of Conroy's novels to fully appreciate the context. But overall, this was a charming collection, and I gathered that Conroy could really light up a room and was a great person to know. His wife described him as \"extremely outgoing,\" but Conroy preferred to say, \"I'm obnoxiously friendly.\" I never met Pat Conroy, but I wish I had. And he wrote so beautifully about South Carolina that I want to visit there. Meanwhile, I'll keep reading his books, and luckily he was so prolific that I will be entertained for a while. I'm glad I read this one. Recommended for fans of the bighearted Pat Conroy.P.S. I also highly recommend Conroy's memoir My Reading Life, which is a charming tribute to the writers and books he's loved, and other people who have influenced his reading.Favorite Quote[from the Introduction by his wife, Cassandra King]\"Pat was always happiest when he was writing, when he lost himself in the narrative that overtook him and flowed from his pen onto the pages of the yellow legal pads he used for his books. His musings, critiques, observations, and meditations he was more likely to write in his journals, which are also full of bits and pieces of stories he hoped to use one day. Pat collected stories like others might collect rare stamps, or a library of illustrious music. Hearing a good story filled him with great excitement. Afterward, he was apt to grab a pen and say to the teller, 'Consider that story stolen. If you plan to write it one day, you'd better do it first.'\""}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "4\u2605 + 1 \u2605 (because it's dedicated to me and you)A final reading gift from The Great Conroy\u2014The Prince of Tides.Composed of interviews, articles, speeches, letters, and tributes, this one is dedicated to us, his loyal readers. A final posthumous love letter to us devoted fans.When Pat started writing his blog he did not own an e-device and had never been on Twitter or Facebook.

He began each offering with \u201cHey, out there\u201d and ended with \u201cGreat love . . .\u201dI enjoyed this immensely and recommend it highly to other readers who have had multiple book affairs with him.I did not know that: Pat was once invited by Margaret Mitchell's heirs to write a sequel to Gone with the Wind (negotiations and conditions proved too overwhelming and stringent).Too funny: \u201cI found myself in the men\u2019s room with the huge actor Mr. T. When I looked over as I stood beside him peeing, I said, 'Mine\u2019s bigger', and Mr. T screamed with laughter and I\u2019ve loved Mr. T since that moment.\"I wish I had written this but Mary Ellen Thompson gets the credit: \u201cReading a Pat Conroy novel is like being lashed to a mast, and sailing into a story that surrounds you like a blanket of fog.

At 58.0%: Enjoying some of these pieces more than others, but it's clear that the man had some wonderful long-term friendships.I'm a fan of this author and was one of those saddened when he passed away. Since I was heading to the Lowcountry this month decided it was the perfect opportunity to read this one. As you can see from the blurb, it's a collection of pieces, and I was in tears for the first several. This man's gift was his honestly and vulnerability in his writing, and there is a reason he is much beloved by his readers. In this collection, some from his blog, he pays homage to reader, writers, teachers, mentors, friends, and all who wear the ring.

Throughout A LOWCOUNTRY HEART,  the indisputable power of Conroy\u2019s work resonates, and his influence promises to endure. A sharing of stories. A moving tribute and a cherished keepsake for Conroy fans. To one of the best-loved writers of contemporary American letters.\u201cA man who loved the written work beyond all measure, and who believed that each of us has at least one great story to tell.\u201dFrom Conroy\u2019s famous \u201chey, out there,\u201d his first letter ever written for his website, his hated word \u201cblog\u201d, his special friends, and his love of the LowCountry\u2014Charleston. From his special journals, letters, interviews, and essays, to his oldest friend, Bernie Schein's farewell letter to the beautiful introduction and acknowledgments by his beloved wife and writer, Cassandra King Conroy. Even includes a Conversation with Pat Conroy, from Beaufort Lifestyles, Oct 2015.A touching collection  of moments and treasures from the man we all admired. From an intimate letter to his grandson about sportsmanship and basketball, Citadel, Andie MacDowell, Beaufort, his books, his writing life, teachers, Vietnam, Charlie Gibson of Good Morning America, Paris Days, A Eulogy for a Southern Gentleman, South of Broad,  Penn Center, one of the first schools for freed slaves, (his final resting place-Memorial Garden), birthdays, travels, teachers, his first book, sermons and speeches, plus many more special tidbits from an extraordinary man.Each fan will have special fond memories of different segments of the memoir. I particularly enjoyed how he met Cassandra King , later in life, where they found in their fifties and sixties, a time of joy, productivity, and contentment. Their shared love of books, writing, and life. Their first meeting at a writer\u2019s conference in Birmingham, Alabama. She fell upon his spell. Their twenty years together. People were Starstruck by him and his presence. \u201cPat could make the deaf hear and the mute speak. Sweeping you up in a conversation with those intense blue eyes focused like lasers on you and you alone, he had the ability to ferret out your secret self that had been undercover for a lifetime. \u201cFrom his musings,  critiques, observations, and meditations, his journals, and stories. How a hearing a good story filled him with great excitement. His love of book signings. Stories were a way Pat connected with readers. It was amusing  to read about his resisting modern technology, emails, blogs, tweets, and twitters. However, most of the works in this collection come from the \"blog\" he began to write when he was between books; when his health began to fail since he was limited to travel.These were called blog posts or letters. He never learned to type. It was the way he collected the stories he would turn into the books his readers yearned for. He would take your story and make it large and glorious and unforgettable. From his great love of books, his first, The Boo,  plus some of his favorite authors and friends, John Grisham, John Irving, Richard Russo, Anne Rivers Siddons, Ron Rash, Fannie Flagg, and more\u2013 books that inspired him, and his family. Being a native Carolinian, enjoyed revisiting special places like the Highlands, NC, Atlanta, GA, Charleston and Beaufort, SC, among others. Pat was a great man, a talented author, possessing a rare gift, which is missed tremendously.A beautiful collection, a treasure, and tribute to his work and his life.

I read the first half before going to sleep last night and finished this morning as soon as I woke up. I feel like I've just spent several hours visiting with an old friend, and now his death has hit me all over again. It destroys me that we will never read another one of this stories again, so I'm going to have to go back and re-read his others (I may even go back and finish South of Broad, which was the only one I didn't love, but knowing more of the backstory might make it more appealing now.) If you are a fan of Pat Conroy, and have read all of his books (including The Death of Santini), then you will want to devour this one (you do need the background of his stories to appreciate it because the whole book refers back to them). It's a collection of his blog posts (he wasn't very computer-savvy, and started each post with \"Hey out there --\" which made me smile each time I started a new chapter.I haven't cried this much since I finished The Nightingale last summer, even though these are a different kind of tears. What a storyteller he was. What a loss. But I'm so thankful for this collection, which ends with the eulogy given at his funeral; this last part did me in:\"Some of us he entertained grandly. Others of us he outraged greatly. To all of us, he gave a rare gift. He came to us from afar, like Faulkner and like Wolfe. But I respectfully suggest, in ways more real and more loving than either of them, that he gave us the opportunity, in the phrase of Burns, 'to see ourselves as others see us.' For this alone, we should be forever grateful to Pat Conroy, our very own prince of tides. \" 'Good-night sweet prince. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.'

I read hundreds of books from various of genres, but none of them have had the significant impact that Pat books has on me. Starting with the first book I read, South of Broad, the novels will always have a permanent place in my heart. Now unto the contents of this book, it is hard to even type out this review without getting emotional.Pat was loved by his readers, the lengths he took to make sure everyone feel welcome is amazing. I liked how it was described how he waited in long lines for his fans and always greeted them with warmth. I never met him in person, but I can tell how much he cared about the people that supported him. Told by his wife, she explained in great detail how lovable he was among his friends and peers. Grieved that he never learned to type, he wrote all of his notes down. I liked how he did not rely on Kindle or any other technological device, but wanted to be personal with his fans. Social media was not keen to him, that is what made me love him more. There were so many highlights in this book, but the pictures with the rich detail accompanied this masterpiece.Pat I love you, thank you for sharing your stories with the world.

For me the saddest day this year was the death of Conroy, and the thought of never having any more of his stories much depressed me. I still feel a loss. I am glad that I got to meet him once and shake his hand (I didn't ask for an autograph or bend his ear, but was just delighted to be near him for a few minutes). His books, especially LORDS OF DISCIPLINE and GREAT SANTINI, touched many deep emotions in me and may even have helped shape my view of the world. Much of what is included in this small collection (many pieces from his blog) I already had read, but that didn't matter. I read them again. And yes, there is some room for criticism, as the compilers chose essays that were often repetitive, as if there were certain things (like his basketball team, for instance) that he couldn't completely let go of. One only hopes there is a hidden treasure trove of unpublished material somewhere, even if it be mere scraps and fragments, for we hungry Conroy fans are feeling the withdrawals. I liked those entries written by friends, colleagues, and family in remembrance of Conroy. Although he had some negative personality traits and behaviors during his life (which it seems he always acknowledged), what he gave to his readers will far outreach those small blemishes, because this fan thinks he more often than not stood up on the right side of most issues, while continuing to love even those who opposed him (such as his classmates for a few decades). He was a nostalgic man. He paid a price for his stands, but he was often ahead of most people in his sympathies.

What makes him an island unto himself is his intimate, confessional writing. I\u2019ve been wrestling with trying to articulate exactly why his words speak to so many and have arrived at the conclusion that at the foundation of his God given gift to effortlessly arrange words is the bedrock of clear thinking. Too many people buckle under the weight of their own unwieldy emotional level, and as it is only human nature to duck and cover from pain and confusion, their unexamined emotional life takes on a crippling weight all its own and leads to a list of crimes against the human heart. The magic of Conroy is in his fearlessness to call anything by name and his cache of language to do so exactly. In so doing for himself, he does so for humanity. His is a dauntless, confident voice so surefooted, his readers know and trust him. Each of his novels sends the reader through the thicket of life itself then leaves them parked in front of a mirror to reflect. In A Lowcountry Heart, Conroy tells his legions of fans not only how he does this, but why. I\u2019ve heard Conroy called a generous writer by many, and this book tells me how he earned the reputation. Behold, the man behind the curtain, who has a seat across from you and looks you in the eye as he explains what goes on in his passionate soul.
