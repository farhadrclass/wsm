I became familiar with The Masked Man, aka David Shoemaker, mainly through his work at Grantland, and have always found him to be an interesting and thought provoking read on the subject.There is a lot of interesting history and stories in the book. However, I think it suffers from the format. Chapters focus on a particular wrestler, similar to his Dead Wrestler of the Week columns, but as a result, there's a lot of repeated material as the histories of various wrestlers intersect. This is fine for columns that stand by themselves, but in a book, it becomes off-putting. Since it's all told from a third party perspective, there isn't much gained from hearing the same story in a different context.I think, to some degree, the book would be improved if it cut the number of wrestlers it focused on, and went longer form on a small number. Andre the Giant may be the last person who is as much legend as reality. People spinning yarns about Andre the Giant is probably a very good book unto itself, but here he's just the guy between Junkyard Dog and Lou Albano (that's a little unfair: Andre is never \"just the guy\" to a wrestling fan and Shoemaker is no different. But it illustrates the point). I don't mean to say either in particular should have been cut, but I don't think thought was given to the fact including more wrestlers implicitly cut the attention given to any individual.Overall, I enjoyed this book and would be eager to have more by Shoemaker. I'm somewhat critical only because there is so little quality content on the subject, and I know what he's capable of delivering. Any wrestling fan should definitely pick this one up."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Lynn Harrison", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4911921-jennifer-lynn-harrison", "userReview": "Yes, it is true that I have only finished the 6 hour PART 1 of this Audible book, but I am going to split the review in 2 parts, just as the book is split into two parts.This was GOOD. If you like wrestling, that is. If you are not already a WWE fan, and do not already know a LOT of wrestling history (which, don't worry- I DO) then this book is not going to be a good read for you. The author jumps in without pausing for breath. For example, he will start talking about Wrestlemania matches, assuming that you already know all the outcomes (I do). This book (so far) has TONS of amazing tidbits of info, biographies, behind the scenes stories, info on deals, ratings, etc. BUT did not discuss the actual topic in the TITLE-- DEATH within the wrestling industry. I mean, I liked re-learning that Andre the Giant drank 2 litres of vodka as his 'one drink', but I kept waiting in vain for the author to discuss the great number of men and women who have died (mainly of heart failure) because of the tole this industry (and the drugs, in cases) take on their bodies. Owen Hart died IN the ring and is not mentioned, Chris Benoit (steroids) not mentioned, Eddie Guerrero (heart attack) not mentioned, yet JunkYard Dog's death was discussed at length, and he died in an un-wrestling related car accident....? So, false advertisement so far. Again, I am 6 hours in, with 6 to go. Currently, the book goes back and forth between the past and present days of wrestling, but at the moment of this section's end, it is focusing on the career of Macho Man (no mention of his death yet) and the advertisements that various wrestlers have done over the years.Basically, if you like wrestling, you WILL like this book, because it is full of great stuff; it is just not the book that I thought it would be, based on the title.--Jen from Quebec :0)"}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon", "userReview": "David Shoemaker rose to prominence with his weekly Deadspin column, \u201cDead Wrestler of the Week\u201d. At first glance, the column\u2019s title seems unnecessarily harsh but Shoemaker writes with a real passion for those who entertained us during their sometimes short lived career. At some point, he decided to adapt this into a book about the history of pro wrestling and those who\u2019ve passed before their time. Cramming over one hundred years of history into a tight four hundred pages isn\u2019t an easy task but Shoemaker does a surprisingly comprehensive job.For someone who has read countless wrestling biographies and viewed dozens of documentaries on the subject, this book may not be a necessary read. Shoemaker covers ground that many have in the past with extensive write-ups on the collapse of the NWA (National Wrestling Alliance), the poaching of top territory stars by Vince McMahon in his ambitious attempt to bring the WWF to a national audience as well as the Monday Night War between WWF and WCW and the era-defining moment of the Montreal Screwjob. Of course, no attempt to tell the history of pro wrestling should be without these subjects but there\u2019s only so much to say about it before it sounds repetitive.That being said, while I\u2019m sure I\u2019m aware of ninety percent of what Shoemaker is writing, I still found it to be an engaging and entertaining read. One thing worth noting is his exhaustive research into the days before professional wrestling was a performance art and still maintained a certain sense of legitimacy. Prior to its move to a more entertainment based spectacle, matches could last hours with one in fact lasting nearly five and a half hours before one for the participants just gave up due to exhaustion! Shoemaker traced the evolution of the sport back to legendary promoter Toots Mondt who is basically responsible for the scripted style that we enjoy today.The format is a little strange with the timeline of major events broken up by what could be considered obituaries for wrestlers who have since passed on and what they had meant to the industry. There\u2019s some great write-ups for such legendary performers as Randy Savage, Junkyard Dog, Owen Hart, Gorgeous George, The Fabulous Moolah and even low level talents like Ray \u201cThe Big Bossman\u201d Traylor. While they\u2019re very comprehensive for their length, they often break up the flow of the text and seem inserted randomly with no real timeline or reason for their positioning.What we\u2019re left with at the end of the day is a pretty extensive look at pro wrestling\u2019s history. It\u2019s not the best that I\u2019ve read on the subject \u2013 there are better books that focus on a very specific time or promotion (Heath McCoy\u2019s book about Stampede Wrestling is a great example) but as an overall history of the \u201csport\u201d, Shoemaker gives us a solid read."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31738445-kristi", "userReview": "Every child of the 80s who grew up watching wrestling on Saturday mornings should give this book a chance. I was floored by how eloquent and insightful the writing was, because come on, it's a book about wrestling, so my expectations were low. David Shoemaker is an entertaining writer that really understands how to write about sports, something that so many become so passionate about. He is at turns funny and brutally honest, and it made for a perfectly sobering look at the real-life trauma that so many on-screen characters have faced over the last couple of decades. I highly recommend this book to pretty much anyone that is curious in the least about the WWF, the origins of wrestling, and the tragedy that befell so many that lived to entertain."}, {"userName": "Theo Girvan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40828078-theo-girvan", "userReview": "The ref counts three, the timekeeper rings the bell, the announcer says goodnight, the houselights come up.

Then I finally realized WHAT it was that these guys do night after night, and that childhood love came rushing back along with a newfound respect for the performers and what they do. These are professional stuntmen/actors and while they are loved, they generally aren't respected in the way that they should be and this book seems to try correct that and pay a little tribute.I think this is a book every Pro wrestling fan should read, from the casual fan to the super fan. Informative and quite interesting, really happy I read it."}, {"userName": "Jeff Raymond", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32271-jeff-raymond", "userReview": "In the last year, I've been roped back into the world of professional wrestling. A rite of passage for any preteen boy as is, it's decidedly uncool as a thirtysomething, but being older now I've come to appreciate a lot of the unique storytelling aspects that go along with the goofy lowbrow craziness that comes with the sport format.David Shoemaker is best known for his Deadspin \"Dead Wrestler of the Week\" pieces as well as writing a regular column for Grantland on the ins and outs of the WWE. It's probably my favorite feature on Grantland these days if only because he appears to be the only mainstream writer taking wrestling seriously, and giving him a full length book opportunity to discuss the topic was something I had to jump at.The book follows two parallel paths. One of the paths is a detailed history of professional wrestling in America, running from the early stages of the genre through the territorial system and in through the Attitude Era of the WWE. The book is near perfect in this regard - it takes a very straightforward, sober look at the ups and downs of the industry, staying serious while being unafraid to come down on some of the more ridiculous or negative turns. While not fully exhaustive, it is surprisingly detailed and might very well be the best printed piece on the subject we have.The other portion of the book is a series of reprints, contextually located in the era the book is covering, of the \"Dead Wrestler\" columns from Deadspin. Seeing as I hadn't read these again since my return to the wrestling fold, they were an interesting look back, but they were also pieces I had already read. As Shoemaker may be catching an audience that he didn't previously have, I'm not completely against the reprints here, but, in this case, it felt less like a value add and more like padding for a book that would have understandably been shorter without them.Really, though, the strength of the book is the context. There's a wealth of information here for anyone who isn't versed in the history of wrestling promotions, and it's a book I can see lending to a number of people who are interested more in the bigger picture than just a bunch of oversized men fake fighting on television. It would benefit from some more information from the last few years, but, as a whole, an excellent read anyone who has had any interest in wrestling, past or present, to give some time."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/819002-drew", "userReview": "Outstanding. Absolutely essential for any fan of pro wrestling, or for anyone seeking to understand why people are fans of pro wrestling. This book truly captures the spirit of the whole silly business, and the fact that it does so through a chronicle of untimely deaths is not lost on me. Wrestling is dark and fucked up--it's a fixed sport in which people entertain crowds by doing incredibly dangerous things to each other and themselves. By focusing on the negative consequences wrestling had on particular practitioners of its dark arts, Shoemaker tells what I would call the spiritual history of wrestling. I've read a whole bunch of books about the business over the years, and I've heard a lot more detail about some aspects of it than I ever got from this book. But there were a lot of great stories in The Squared Circle that I'd never heard. I felt that the attempts to understand some of the worst things that happened in the wrestling business (the tragedy of the Von Erich family, Chris Benoit's horrible crimes) got closer to summing up how I actually feel about them, as well as providing insight I've often found lacking in more straightforward accounts of pro wrestling's history. So yeah, this book is a must. It won't make you happy--other than The Ultimate Warrior, everyone discussed in detail in this book is dead, for starters--but it will make you think, and tell you stories that'll stick with you for the rest of your life (in particular, I will never forget a story about Fritz Von Erich that I read in here). I'm really glad Shoemaker wrote this book, and I hope he writes more about wrestling before it's all said and done.P.S. One warning--the hardcover edition I got has a serious error at the beginning of the Brian Pillman chapter, in which it's obvious that at least a paragraph of text has been unintentionally removed. The chapter refers often to Pillman's one-time tag team partner, Steve Austin, but never identifies him by his full name. It also throws you right into the middle of the action, and if you don't already know what is being discussed (I did--I've seen a documentary about Brian Pillman), you might be pretty lost. So hopefully this error will get fixed in time for the paperback."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1225357-kyle", "userReview": "I grew up watching wrestling. I loved Macho Man Randy Savage, the Ultimate Warrior, the Rockers, the Bush Whackers, hell I could go on and on. As I grew older I lost interest, but when Savage died in 2011 I tuned into Monday Night Raw to see what sort of tribute they would do and I was immediately sucked back in. And when CM Punk dropped this pipe bomb a few months later I was hooked.The next thing you know I'm looking for some good wrestling writers online and I stumble across Shoemaker's work first with his Dead Wrestler of the Week column on Deadspin and then his Grantland stuff. I enjoyed his writing so I was excited when I learned he was writing this book.Though I liked this book for the most part, it's reliance on material from the Deadspin articles hindered my enjoyment somewhat. First, I had already read the Deadspin stuff and because many of the chapters were originally intended to stand alone, Shoemaker often covers the same ground in multiple spots. Also, by keeping the focus on dead wrestlers, wrestlers that played such a vital role in the industry but are still alive (Hulk Hogan, The Undertaker, Ric Flair, etc.) are only mentioned when they cross the paths of the dead ones."}, {"userName": "Tyler Conium", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27228422-tyler-conium", "userReview": "This book is, for the most part, written about all the lives that have been lost to pro wrestling. From Owen Hart and Mr. Perfect, to Chris Benoit. The beginning of the book was very descriptive, as the author takes you through the territorial era. There was much to learn from the first 1/3 of the book, with many wrestlers I knew next to nothing about. However, it seemed midway through the book, Shoemaker's descriptions became less and less in depth. In talking about the more popular wrestlers - you would think there would be more information - instead those chapters seemed quick and only hit on the most common points. As a fan, there isn't much to learn from these chapters, which is unfortunate. In fact, many of the references Shoemaker pulls are directly credited to Wikipedia, which is not the best source of truthful material, and all generally only holds the high points. Overall, it was a solid but underwhelming read. The marriage between death and pro wrestling is long and stories. I feel as though there was so much more Shoemaker could have done with this concept - the first of its kind. In the end, it fell a bit short in details, and even for the average wrestling fan, won't provide much new information."}, {"userName": "Darcy McLaughlin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3667656-darcy-mclaughlin", "userReview": "This book is enjoyable, but if you're already a pretty dedicated wrestling fan then you will probably have heard many of the stories it contains. It's valuable for the early stars it covers, the pre-WWII era wrestling world where people would pay to watch a 3 hour match end in a draw. The bits of history it contains is intriguing to a modern fan, specifically the fact that people have been in on the \"fake\" sport since the very beginning (and we don't really care).Shoemaker definitely has an intelligent approach to the material. The guy hasn't met a reference he didn't like, and has a really big hang up on Barthes in particular. At times it can get a bit tiring, the over-intellectualizing of the entire thing but it is a nice change of pace from other books I've read. Another downfall of the book is that it is a compilation (mostly) of pieces he had written previously, and as such there are some moments when things are repeated. It's not a big deal, but can be a bit repetitive when you've just read about the event a chapter before and it comes up again ten pages later."}, {"userName": "Markus", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4203830-markus", "userReview": "Started really well, tons of good history about the early days of wrestling and a good bios of wrestlers that i did't even know about.

Pro-Wrestling isn't considered the most high-brow of pursuits but another note-to-self was to stop being defensive about things you enjoy as long as you recognize them for what they are (hey I know too many adults who enjoy Superhero comics and Govinda movies instead of being embarrassed by them, so to each our own...)The Squared Circle: Life, Death, and Professional Wrestling exceeded all my expectations of what a deep-dive into pro-wrestling history would be like. Initially apprehensive of reading a book around dead wrestlers, I remember starting off thinking this would be fun anyways other than that. After I read the list of chapters I had another moment of 'do I really want to know about the history of American wrestling in the early 1900's and details of grapplers and promotions I'd never heard off'? Or should I just go to the parts with the meat - I was here for 'modern pro-wrestling history' what with myself being a proud product of the Attitude Era who was 'born-again' many years later. So the temptation to skip to chapters about periods and people you knew little about was high. I'm glad I did nothing of that sort and proceeded in order.Shoemaker is not just a wrestling buff and historian but he's also a very intelligent man and an skilled writer. I always feel that the ability to share your opinions without sounding like you're opinionated is like walking a tightrope between two skyscrapers. To top that off by bringing philosophy and musings about life into something as visceral as professional wrestling is like walking the same tightrope while having a cup of tea. Lest I have not been clear, Shoemaker does this with aplomb. Intertwined with pop culture, the cultural zeitgeist of the times (mostly American), through-out contrasting the real v/s reel aspect of pro-wrestling, understanding how the average fan would 'see' things in that age to explain actions - there is so much to learn. Sex, Lies & Headlocks for the 18-35 male looking for nostalgia this is not. Shoemaker's blogposty style is also perfect for this manner of teaching history as he jumps between a lens from far-away & many years later about the industry at large and it's evolution; to closer analyses of the individual men, women and families (these are the titular dead wrestlers so to speak) which provide a different lens (sometimes even allowing the same incident to be viewed from different points of view).In pro-wrestling speak, this is one book which breaks kayfabe and is yet over with both the marks and smarks."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/206033-kevin", "userReview": "Clear, cogent, brilliantly argued look at pro-wrestling as a struggle between sport and drama, between real life and entertainment, the ultimate encounter with real life being death.

I had watched professional wrestling as a kid (the skit where the Ultimate Warrior is bitten by a cobra after Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts betrayed him after Warrior asked Roberts to help him overcome his fears so he could defeat the Undertaker sticks in my mind), but I wasn't really invested in professional wrestling until my freshman year in college, when I saw three future friends watch SummerSlam 2000, specifically the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match that featured Edge & Christian, the Hardy Boyz, and the Dudley Boyz (\"z\" was used to copyright their names and because it was the late 1990's/early 2000's). Professional wrestling, in the form of WCW/nWo: Revenge on the Nintendo 64, cemented our friendships, as our nightly boisterous battle royales gave us the testing platform that assured that our personalities were compatible.After college, professional wrestling still played a key role in my connections to the world, especially since I had nothing but disposable time and income. I dragged my oldest friends to wrestling shows in Long Island and the City; eventually, they made it clear that the bonds of friendship can be stretched by professional wrestling only so far, and it was clear to me that they didn't enjoy it as much as I did anyway. I made new friends who would travel with me to Philadelphia and small towns in Connecticut and Pennsylvania to watch niche independent professional wrestling companies' shows. And professional wrestling is the bond that brings my current friends together every month as we watch pay-per-views with strangers, soaking in the atmosphere as much as the actual show on screen.For all that, I hadn't been compelled to learn more about the history of professional wrestling in the United States, much less Canada, Mexico, Japan, India, or any of the European nations that lay claim to professional wrestling's history. Shoemaker's book is a good primer for professional wrestling history, filtered through wrestlers who exemplified the different eras of wrestling. The essays, which are mostly adapted from his The Dead Wrestler of the Week columns on Deadspin.com, are too brief but insightful as they try to summarize the wrestlers' lives and how they impacted or were impacted by the periods in which they plied their craft.Shoemaker tries to fit almost a century's worth of wrestling in his book, and his ambition outstrips the book's format's ability to discuss much of it in detail. Because the essays are adapted from his columns, there is a lot of repetition; in a more traditional book, the repetition would be used to create explicit links of thought and common ideas. As it is, it feels more like a collection of columns that mention his ideas rather than a book of eulogies that unite around common themes.Take, for example, his essays about the Modern Era wrestlers Brian \"Crush\" Adams and Yokozuna. Each touches on the period of creative floundering that the then-WWF (now WWE) suffered during the mid-1990s. Each touches on the geopolitics of professional wrestling, how wrestling exploits the value of the foreign Other in order to give the fans easy delineations between hero and villain, and how this is one of the oldest tricks in professional wrestling's book. The two teamed together on various occasions. But the connections between them are not made explicit or explored for the book's thematic impact.The book attempts to be comprehensive about professional wrestling in the United States, but there are some odd omissions. Shoemaker claims (rightfully) that Extreme Championship Wrestling played a large role in how professional wrestling in the Modern Era changed; however, notable wrestlers who worked in Extreme Championship Wrestling, like Anthony \"Pitbull #2\" Durante or Mike \"Mike Awesome/The Gladiator\" Alphonso, aren't covered, which leaves the book with an ECW-shaped hole. He also discusses that Vincent K. McMahon is the current champion of professional wrestling in the United States, but his format doesn't allow him to discuss the fall of the WWE's main competitor, World Championship Wrestling, because no one who is particularly identified with that company is dead yet.Shoemaker's book makes for a good introductory primer about professional wrestling in the United States, but there is still much more to discuss. I hope that he writes a follow-up book; he's shown a deft pen for explaining the history to the uninitiated and for separating the various layers of reality in which professional wrestling operates."}, {"userName": "Brett Milam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8142597-brett-milam", "userReview": "When it comes to writing about professional wrestling, it\u2019s hard to come by truly great writers of the craft. David Shoemaker is one such writer. He\u2019s eloquent and his book \u201cThe Squared Circle\u201d reads like a Greek play, a battle between Gods in a, well, squared circle. It\u2019s a book that spun out of his column chronicling the deaths of wrestlers and came to encompass the history of professional wrestling.And professional wrestling\u2019s history is also the history of American spectator events, television, cable, PPV, and everything in between. As one example, how many great sports athletes, entertainers and other figures cite Gorgeous George, a prominent wrestler in the 1950s timed with the explosion of television, as an influence? Muhammad Ali, for one.\u201cThe world wants to be deceived, so let it be deceived,\u201d is a quote Shoemaker has from Petronius toward the start of his book and right there is the catch. That quote perfectly encapsulates the magic of art, of fiction and of entertainment. That\u2019s the rub. When I go to the movies, I don\u2019t want Brad Pitt winking at me that he\u2019s an actor and all of this is fake. I want to \u201cbuy in\u201d to the fictional presentation. When I read Stephen King, I don\u2019t want an interlude from the author winking at me. I want to \u201cbuy in.\u201d Professional wrestling is no different. I\u2019m not here to convince people that professional wrestling is vastly under-credited and under-analyzed and under-respected, which it is, but it\u2019s worth stressing the rub. And it\u2019s just a good quote.As Shoemaker opens the book, he gets at what\u2019s really \u201cfake\u201d about professional wrestling and to which says something larger about other sports and life and idolatry, \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a mythology populated not by gods, but by real men, fallible mortals who served as vessels for a larger truth, men who lived the lives of kings and who suffered to be our idols. This is the ultimate fakery of wrestling \u2014 that the emperor has no clothes, that the gods are mortals. But in reliving their lives, what became clear is that the mythology is what matters the most. We make our own gods for our own purposes. And we love them, and that\u2019s the whole point.\u201dRight. We don\u2019t want to know the story of Joe Montana having a concussion, not remembering where or who he is. We want to \u201cbuy in\u201d to their godliness, their feats that seem beyond human abilities on the gridiron, in the squared circle, on the stage, wherever. Even if you\u2019re not a wrestling fan, the idolatry that wrestling fans bestow on professional wrestlers is one other fans of other sports and entertainment products can relate to. Moreover, they can relate to watching (and anguishing) over the fall of their gods.Which is why I think even a non-wrestling fan could enjoy this book. It\u2019s a familiar story of the highs, lows, drugs, sex, deception and tragedy associated with the searing heat of the spotlight, the desire to maintain the spotlight and the pitfalls of an elusive spotlight.Perhaps the worst tragedy of it all is the \u201cignoble existence\u201d of a wrestler in the real world, a \u201cpainful and deadly one,\u201d as Shoemaker says toward the end of the book. That a wrestler punishes themselves in the ring, punishes themselves going up and down the roads that transverse the world, and they do so under the bizarre suffocating blanket of wrestling\u2019s \u201cfakery.\u201d Sure, the wrestling fans give them idol-status, if they\u2019re good enough, if they punish themselves enough and even then, we always beg for that \u201cone last match,\u201d but beyond that niche? They\u2019re like the gods of the sewers.Reading this book gives you the most comprehensive, well-written expose and homage into the lives of those that lived this ignoble existence and died for it. Sacrificial lambs to the altar of their dreams."}, {"userName": "Michael Nash", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7049262-michael-nash", "userReview": "This is one of the best books I\u2019ve read all year. You wouldn\u2019t think that there would be much of a market for moving, elegiac prose about Professional Wrestling, but that\u2019s what this is. From the introduction: \"This is a book about dead wrestlers. It was supposed to be, anyway. But along the way, it became a history of professional wrestling told through the stories of the people who made the myths and who thereafter died. It's a story of a mythology populated not by gods but by real men, fallible mortals who served as vessels for a larger truth, men who lived the life of kings and who suffered to be our idols. This is the ultimate fakery of wrestling-- that the emperor has no clothes, that the gods are mortals. But in reliving their lives, what became clear is that the mythology is what matters most. We make our own gods for our own purposes. And we love them, and that's the whole point.\"\tI got into pro-wrestling in August, and have since become fascinated by it as a medium. My interest is academic as well as visceral. Wrestling has this fascinating cooperation between wrestlers and audience in creating a funhouse mirror version of reality. And while I\u2019m sure you could point to other instances of this happening, the level of bombast and extravagance present in pro-wrestling is surely uniquely American. Further, a medium in which a wrestler (CM Punk in a 2011 episode of Monday Night RAW) can give a speech that begins with \u201cOops, I\u2019m breaking the fourth wall\u201d and proceeds to detail all of the real-world problems of the Wrestling industry, but is in fact written by the very people he is criticizing (in wrestling parlance, a \u201cworked shoot\u201d) suggests a delightful level of post-modernism. This is all to say that David Shoemaker gets it. This book took the things that I loved about wrestling and articulated them in a way that I had not. On the subject of the \u201cfakeness\u201d wrestling Shoemaker writes: \u201cWrestling didn't *become* fake in any sort of active way. It could have diverged toward legitimacy like boxing did, but it did not, and shouldn't be judged on those terms. It was once a purer sport, sure-- a sport full of fixed matches and exploitative put-ons. But just as much as it was a sport, it was a sideshow -- a carney act that eventually made it to Broadway. So the next time you hear somebody say 'you know wrestling is fake, right?' you can tell him that yes, you know. That's exactly the point.\"\tIt is by turns informative (with long sections providing background on the wrestling industry from the early days to the Monday Night Wars and the modern dominance of the WWE) funny (Shoemaker on Jack Adkisson aka Fritz von Erich: \"Like so many other tropes in the wrestling world, the Nazism was a lie told to advance a greater truth about the existence of evil in the world and the need to overcome it with headlocks and such.\") and tragic (dealing as it does primarily with the lives of dead wrestlers, and their often horrific deaths.) It even has a chapter on the notorious Chris Benoit, who has been scrubbed from all official records or products of the WWE.\tIn short, I highly, highly recommend it, even for people that aren\u2019t into wrestling. But then, I also recommend wrestling to people that aren\u2019t into wrestling, so what do I know?"}], "description": "Grantland and Deadspin correspondent presents a breakthrough examination of the professional wrestling, its history, its fans, and its wider cultural impact that does for the sport what Chuck Klosterman did for heavy metal.\u00a0The Squared Circle grows out of David Shoemaker\u2019s writing for Deadspin, where he started the column \u201cDead Wrestler of the Week\u201d (which boasts over 1 million page views) -- a feature on the many wrestling superstars who died too young because of the abuse they subject their bodies to -- and his writing for Grantland, where he covers the pro wrestling world, and its place in the pop culture mainstream. Shoemaker\u2019s sportswriting has since struck a nerve with generations of wrestling fans who\u2014like him\u2014grew up worshipping a sport often derided as \u201cfake\u201d in the wider culture. To them, these professional wrestling superstars are not just heroes but an emotional outlet and the lens through which they learned to see the world.\u00a0Starting in the early 1900s and exploring the path of pro wrestling in America through the present day, The Squared Circle is the first book to acknowledge both the sport\u2019s broader significance and wrestling fans\u2019 keen intellect and sense of irony. Divided into eras, each section offers a snapshot of the wrestling world, profiles some of the period\u2019s preeminent wrestlers, and the sport\u2019s influence on our broader culture. Through the brawling, bombast, and bloodletting, Shoemaker argues that pro wrestling can teach us about the nature of performance, audience, and, yes, art.\u00a0Full of unknown history, humor, and self-deprecating reminiscence\u2014but also offering a compelling look at the sport\u2019s rightful place in pop culture\u2014The Squared Circle is the book that legions of wrestling fans have been waiting for.
