Granted, if there is a favourite, I will try my best to purchase it. Especially a hardcover version. I found New York to Dallas in a second hand store this summer and paid over my $6 for it. I nearly cried when I left behind about 20 other hardcover JD ROBB books but I had no room in my luggage for any more. (If you happen to be visiting Bandon, OR, check out Kimberly's Book Nook. It is a treasure trove of books.)I was a little wary starting this series. Nora Roberts had not really been a hit with me as an author ... and as she also writes as JD ROBB, hence my caution. Especially as one of the main characters was Irish. But I went in and I am so glad I did. 33 books later and it is not getting old.I knew this one would be quite a pivotal book in the series. All the other books are \"..... In Death\" - this one had a completely different title. Those of you who have read the series will know that Dallas, the city, featured in the past.\nBut Dallas. She'd never considered he'd use Dallas ...\nRoarke! What can I say that I haven't said already. He is sexy, generous, loving, kind, rich ... and Irish!!!\nI once stood in a field in Ireland, alone, a little lost, and wishing for you more than I wished for my next breath. And you came, though I never asked you, you came because you knew I needed you. we don't always do what's right, what's good. Not even for each other. but when it counts, down to the core of it, I believe we do exactly that. What's right and good for each other.\"\"There's no rules to that, Eve. It's just love.\"Just love, she thought when he stepped out. She may have been going into her own personal hell to face a killer, but right at that moment she considered herself the luckiest woman in the world.\nOK, they have their ups and downs. It is not all rosy in the garden. She can be a bitch. He can be a bollocks (to use one of his own expressions). But, at the end of the day, they are always there for each other.\n\"What do you have in your pocket?\"He smiled, drew out the gray button that had fallen off her very ugly suit the first day they'd met.She couldn't understand why that stupid button moved her so damn much.\nTell me about it, Eve. Moves me to tears every time I read about it!Bit of a shocker thrown in that I sort of saw coming. The tale was quite gruesome. The \"bad guy\" was a total prick. As we were in Dallas for a lot of the story, we didn't interact much with the secondary characters much. We did catch up with Peabody, Feeney and Dr Mira.I will take a wee break now and read something else but I am sure I will be back on the \"In Death\" bandwagon very soon.\n\"I believe that's the sweetest thing you've said to me in all our time together.\"\n\n... she watched New York break through the clouds.\nSweet Epilogue too."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6049062-jen", "userReview": "Book #33 and still going strong!! I LOVED this one! First of all, I should know better than to start an Eve and Roarke book when I have work in RL to do!! Nothing ends up existing when I become captivated by one of JD Robb's masterpieces. This installment ended being one of the very best of the series. I was kind of worried about this one as I knew that Eve would probably be going to Dallas to solve a case instead of her home town of New York. The thing is...for Eve; Dallas has memories for Eve...and they are traumatic ones. I knew without a doubt that this book was going to be heavy...and it was an emotional read in several ways.Roarke remained in fine form by being Eve's rock, and all I can say is he still remains the best hero I have ever become aquainted with in Romance. I mean it when I say that no man will ever be able to top Roarke.I could go on all day about this series! The fact is, JD Robb has created a world in this series that feels real to me. The characters in it have become people that I am familiar with, and they have come alive in my mind whenever I crack open one of these books! This is the only series to date that has 45 + books in it, and is still going strong. I know people may be skeptical about that, but it's no joke...this series is unique, exciting, suspenseful, and I love every book I have read in it.If you are an avid reader, you need to take this series on! I promise....you won't be disappointed! It is the best of the best, and I don't feel it can ever be beat!"}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "This was one of the most emotional books of the series. Eve has to go back to Dallas - the place where she was found as a broken, beaten child - to confront a serial killer who has a vendetta against her. It was a tough road for her, but there were also plenty of diversions to keep the story from being too depression-inducing. The best of the diversionary tactics was Eve's complete annoyance with the \"Southern Hospitality\" that is so common in Texas. \n\u201cHow's it going down there?\"\"It's weird. They're too polite, they talk funny, and stuff has too much shine on it.\u201d \nI have to admit that, being from Los Angeles, it threw me off a bit at first too. People are so nice, courteous, and friendly that I thought they were either crazy or trying to set me up to ask for money. It took me a while to let my guard down, but I'm happy to say that after 19 years here, I'm friendly to people I meet in my daily life too. Younger me would think older me is a crazy person for talking to strangers and smiling at them. But, hey, when in Rome...The only thing missing from this book was Peabody & McNab. I love that couple. But, it was still probably the most intense book of the series and makes up for their loss with the emotional and gritty in Eve and Roarke's relationship."}, {"userName": "Banny Kirsten Marie Reviews", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68664225-banny-kirsten-marie-reviews", "userReview": "This was most defiantly one of the best but gruesome detective books that i have ever read in my life! I loved the plot and the characters and at then end the story had me on my knees begging for more. This book is number 33 in the In Death Series but i honestly did not care i have read about three books in the series but never have i read them in the order they should be in. Not that it madders because each book is just a diffrent case to be solved. New York to Dallas is an open and shut case about rape\u2026 People may find a book like that disturbing and there was few times that i wanted to throw the book across the room and run to the bathroom and throw up! The investigator Eve Dallas is on a mission to arrest Isaac Mcqueen who is a man that has been abducting young girls and rapeing them. This strong, brave, and courages women has had run in's with this character before and she also had a father who had his way with her whenever she was younger.  I admire Detective Eve Dallas because if i had seen what was locked away in Isaac Mcqueens closet all those years ago then i would not be able to take the case and i would proably move out of town and clear the images out of my mind. I bet you would like me to tell you what was in Mcqueens closet\u2026 Well if you want to know so bad either crack open the book or send me a message because i do not want to ruin anything for other people.  This was my first ever adult novel and real detective story and i simply adored it and J.D Rob is one of my favorite authors. This book goes beyond drop dead amazing\u2026 I loved how intense it was and how sexy it could get whenever it came to the relationship with Eve and her husband Roarke who was also a detective just so you know. This is why crime became one of my favorite genras its a reccomendation to everyone who likes to read about a god women investigator but NOT a book for kids or anyone under 16\u2026 Possibly even 17 this is a fare warning very gruesome!

I enjoyed it, as I often enjoy these books, but one thought that I can't shake, now that I'm done, is the idea that this series is going to have to draw to a conclusion now. A lot of the large, overarching story threads that have been interwoven are being given answers, and I feel that, as far as the interpersonal/relationship conflicts go, not just with Eve and Roarke, but the secondary characters as well, that these have all been pretty well tied up. So further books are either going to need new interpersonal conflicts, new secondary characters, or are going to have to rely pretty solely on the mystery conflicts to drive them. Since the heart of these books has always been how the characters weave into the stories, I find it difficult to imagine the series going on much longer."}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "I ALMOST gave this 5 stars, but the sheer coincidence of the character TWIST was enough for 4 1/2. Nonetheless this was a REALLY REALLY good book:1) Creepy bad guy2) Lots of character stakes3) Overall plot forward-pushing.Thumbs up! It's so amazing that after 33 books you can still really CARE about how the characters interact with one another, whether they succeed or not. THis one had a TON of tension, the most in quite a while in the series. Yes, we've seen a lot of this past trauma touched on before, but the cathartic push seems to close some doors behind Eve, so she can really move forward from her past, maybe big relationship progress for the future?! I mean, this series is kind of wish-fulfillment in a lot of ways, but I guess I relate to Eve's attitude a lot, and the character interactions are well worth the price of admission. :) Can't wait for the next one, which sounds like a really fun premise."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5477946-kristen", "userReview": "5+ StarsFavorite book in the Series thus far.

Robb\u2019s immensely popular futuristic series that shows what happens after the HEA ends with the main couple who end up married. Eve Dallas and Roarke is one of my all favorite romantic couples. Roarke is my favorite hero hands down, regardless of him being way too perfect for words. After so many books with these two, I feel as if they\u2019re old friends I can turn to for comfort. Also I love how the series takes place in New York City and forty years in a future I can see coming to pass. I can\u2019t wait for the day when I can have my own flying car and auto chef.New York to Dallas should be a milestone in this series. I knew something big was going to go down when for the first time, the title didn\u2019t have the two words- In Death. I had an inkling what this shocking reveal might be that happens in this story, and I was correct. Unfortunately the way this was divulged was less than satisfactory. It was very lacking and just thrown in there, as if Robb knew what her readers wanted and she had to give them something to make them happy. Lately, I\u2019ve become fatigued with this series. After 33 books, what more can you do? I love seeing the tender side of Roarke and Eve and how they\u2019re still trying to figure each other out. These two are such opposites, and for all purposes, shouldn\u2019t be able to sustain a relationship together. But they do, and even though the toughest of times, they work out their issues and always go to bed together, waking up the next morning in each other\u2019s arms. Most of the time Eve is a snarling cranky wench the next day, while Roarke just sits there placating her with his swarmy sexiness.New York to Dallas is set up like most of the past books. A horrible crime has been committed and Eve must solve it, always with Roarke lending more than a helping hand. But this latest case hits close to home for Eve. A pedophile killer has broken out of jail, which coincidentally is the first case Eve ever solved. The pedophile, Issac McQueen was the first criminal Eve brought down when she was still green and just starting out as a police officer. Now that Issac is on the loose, he\u2019s up to his old tricks and has targeted Eve. Also, Issac may be hiding out in Dallas, Texas. Eve once lived there as a child and was left by her mother who in turn was horribly abuse by her father, who she killed in self-defense as he tried to rape her again. Eve has to confront her past again, while remaining strong as she tries to figure out where Issac is, who\u2019s helping him and stop him from kidnapping, raping and killing young girls.The McQueen case hits Eve hard because she once was a victim just like the girls McQueen targets. Whenever young girls are involved and brutalized by some monster, Eve takes it personally because she was once in their shoes. But the McQueen case takes on a whole new meaning because someone working with McQueen may have ties to Eve\u2019s past and her parents.I was so hoping New York to Dallas would hit one out of the park for me. It didn\u2019t. I did find the case and the non-stop action from Eve and her crew to be on the edge of your seat material, but it feels as if it has that been there, done that feeling to it already. The way Eve and Roarke interact has become routine, even down to the minimal love scenes they share together. At a certain point I felt as if these two were tired about everything and they need to get away to regroup.The big twist that should shock failed for me. The way it was revealed was poorly executed and comes out of the blue, more like a throwaway. It didn\u2019t really fit, and even when Eve has that light bulb moment, I had to re-read because it was confusing. I felt as if I missed something, as if Robb left out a few important pieces that should have been introduced earlier on. This spoiler really closes up so many loose ends for Eve and her past, and I wonder if perhaps Robb perhaps is decided to finally end this series. There\u2019s not much more she can do with the characters. They can\u2019t really grow anymore and they have become static. Even if a new uber type villain is introduced to shake things up, it really wouldn\u2019t breathe life back into this series.All parties have to end and with the In Death books and the case of Eve and Roarke, I really think it\u2019s time to say goodbye and say thanks for the good times. New York to Dallas was more ho hum reading with a few zingers here and there, but not enough to keep me reading this series indefinitely.I was hoping for so much more with this book, but in the end it just didn\u2019t deliver."}, {"userName": "Saly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3192922-saly", "userReview": "I am not going to go into the story but just say a few things about the series, it has become really predictable not that, that is bad but I would like to see Eve evolve.Things there in all books:Eve getting so into a case, that she doesn't eat, sleep and acts like a boor and has dreams about her past mixed up with the victims, as usual Roarke is there, feeding her and forcing her to look after herself, even siccing Mira on her when needed. We have the customary fight for no reason when Even tries to piss Roarke off.I do believe the series has to end because these things have become so noticeable to me. All these plot elements are utilized each time.

But then I thought, No, there will always be serial killers, stuff that blows up, devious minds, and twisted stories!This is right up there in my all time favourites of this series - love, love, love this book. Meeting Eve's mother, as horrible as that woman was, filled in some gaps in Eve's background and confirmed some of Eve's suspicions/ideas about her mother. Isaac MacQueen is so twisted and sick - a villain you love to hate period! He also gave Eve the chance to finally put her memory of her father to bed and be done with it.Lots of extra characters in this book, but not so many to bog you down.

Why? It's the culmination of everything Eve and Roarke have done in their relationship up to this point. With tender moments, agonizing soul searching (well as much as Eve and Roarke can agonize), and a vulnerability that express why and how these two love each other; combined with the crime procedural we've come to expect in an In Death book; J.D. Robb masterfully gives us the exact right blend of both the inner workings of a loving committed relationship AND the inner workings of a depraved mad man. It's not easy for an author to continue to play out what happens in a relationship with two long standing characters; but here we find the author digging deeper into why Roarke and Eve love each other and how they continue to sustain that love."}, {"userName": "Tiffany PSquared", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27443399-tiffany-psquared", "userReview": "Talk about jumping into the deep end of the pool! This was my first Eve Dallas book and I opted for the audiobook. (I know, I know. It was a crazy place to start a series) I don't know if it was the ardent delivery of the narrator that alienated me from Lieutenant Dallas - I do love a good strong female lead - but I felt like maybe she was a bit too strong. Untouchable. Unrelatable. And ultimately I think I ended up feeling sorry for her husband and her therapist/profiler Dr. Mira - that they were committed to loving her and dealing with all of her... issues.I'm not sure if I'm interested at all in reading any more of this series. The story itself wasn't lacking any of Nora Roberts' J.D. Robb's usual characterization, build, or excitement of conflict resolution. The villain was sufficiently evil, his crimes sufficiently atrocious, and the resolution sufficiently thrilling. The sole reason I'm opting against continuing the series is simply that I found myself unable to relate - in any way - to the MC.For dedicated \"...in Death\" fans this is not a judgment against you or the series as a whole.

The pages of this book are super intense and I had the creepy crawly feelings all throughout as I read it.

After reading it I can totally get on board with the name change because it felt a little out of step with the others. I felt a lot like Eve did while reading this book. She wasn't in her familiar place, with her familiar people doing her familiar things. She had to set up her board in a Dallas hotel room, she could only intermittently connect with her regular posse. The Dallas E-detectives were a little off, the bull-pen at the Dallas precinct was too clean, the people too shiny. They smiled a lot. It all threw her off her stride. So in reading this book everything felt a little off.The police procedural aspect of the book was still very solid. But I can't give this book higher than 3 stars for a couple of reasons.First, again with the psycho-sociopath with mommy issues. I think if you do a mental back-track of all the serial killers/psychopaths in the series, fully half of them will be these emotionally stunted man-boys with mother issues. And they all somehow get focused on Eve. And Second, there is a fairly major plot twist/reveal in the course of the story that felt implausible to me. I know that is is a small world after all, but Eve's world must be the size of a pin given how many people she manages to meet up with who have connections with each other and to her. I remember feeling major skepticism when it was revealed that Eve's father and Roarke's father had known each other. But I shrugged it off and went with it. This time though my reaction was 'oh for the love of....gimme a break.'In retrospect though, it feels all very tidy-plot syndrome. It feels like some long-hanging dangly threads are being snipped. But if this plot twist means that the long-standing issue of Eve and her nightmares and her not-quite being able to get over her hellacious childhood can finally be put to rest then I'll live with this one too. I hope that is what this means. I hope this is the final step in Eve being able to finally, fully heal.So while I liked the police procedural aspect of the book, I wasn't crazy about the personal stuff in this one. Still, it is a must read for devotees of the series."}, {"userName": "Jane Jago", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54499726-jane-jago", "userReview": "Awaiting the new In Death due out in February.

An escapee pedophile and murderer that 12 years ago, rookie officer Dallas of the NYPD had brought him in, is now going after revenge against her. The similarities with her abusive past and this case is bringing out feelings and memories that had been buried all this time and that she has been fighting to overcome. All through the previous books she learns little by little pieces of memory from the terrifying and abusive past of when she was a little child of 8 years and was found traumatized, broken, hungry and covered in blood after killing the monster who was her Dad. The unconditional love of her husband Roarke and the motherly love and understanding of Mira, the department psychiatrist and profiler, has been the catalyst to open like flower petals those new memories and given her a way of adjusting and the tools for learning to overcome that past.Isaac, the pedophile is using some of the knowledge he obtain in prison about her past to complete his new mission of revenge and keep going where he left off. Using one of the victims from the past, he is able to demand that Eve return to the city where she was found as a child, Dallas, Texas, and where she had been raped, abused physically and mentally and used as a mark by her Dad. During the developing of the story her wounds are reopen and her feelings become raw, while trying to keep her sanity and strength to be able to do her job and save the victims that are hers now. To top all, the partner that is helping this guy is someone very close from her past and has played a big part in her nightmares. Out of her comfort zone, it is important for her to grasp at anything that reminds her of who she is now and all that keeps her grounded, even away she uses her own people to help her along.This book brings out raw emotions, the power of true love and great detective work all at once in these chapters. For those that follow the series you get a glance at the power that drives this detective to make her the best homicide detective of NYPD and get a deeper understanding of Eve Dallas the person. A very adsorbing and intense book, that pulls at the strings of your heart core and keeps you in constant expectancy of the outcome, all the way to the finish. In my opinion, this is one of the best installment, if not her best of the series, makes me wonder what J.D. Robb will bring next.review link: http://www.onceuponatwilight.com/2011..."}, {"userName": "Allison (The Allure of Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1637878-allison-the-allure-of-books", "userReview": "Well folks, another installment (the 33rd!) of the In Death series, New York to Dallas, by J.D. Robb is going to be released next week. If you\u2019ve followed my blog for any decent amount of time, you know I am an obsessive fan of the series. This one is no exception! It definitely takes things a little bit off the beaten path\u2026Eve, Roarke and the posse all start out in the futuristic NYC as usual\u2026then an old case \u2013 Eve\u2019s first case \u2013 comes back to haunt her in a big way. Dude breaks out of jail and all hell breaks loose. Y\u2019all, this guy is one evil SOB. One of the best things about the series (to me) is that the murders (Eve is a homicide detective) are grisly and realistic. In this case, we have a pedophile whose victim count reaches the double digits. This time around, he is more interested in making Eve crazy than anything else. He has an elaborate plan that eventually has Eve and Roarke chasing him to Dallas (also known as Eve\u2019s worst nightmare).So, I won\u2019t get into too many spoilers for those of you that haven\u2019t read the series, but for those of you that have: lots of Eve\u2019s past is revealed in Dallas. So much, in fact, that the coincidences mount up quick enough that you\u2019ll have to suspend disbelief a little bit to take it all in. Pretty intense stuff too.Also, Eve has cops in Dallas working with her for the most part, so not as much with Peabody, Feeney or any of the rest this time around. I kinda miss having them around! Although, I am happy to say that you do get to witness Whitney giving somebody hell for their incompetence (I never feel like the book is complete without getting to see him chewing somebody out) and there are a couple of awww scenes where Feeney acts all fatherly towards Eve. So all is not lost.Definitely another strong addition to the series! Not my favorite, but I think long-time readers are going to appreciate the insight into Eve\u2019s past. Definitely nice to have that development. I\u2019m very curious now to see what happens in the next book when things shift back to NYC!"}, {"userName": "\u2606 Sammy \u2606\u5f61", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14144676-sammy", "userReview": "New York to Dallas was by far one of the most emotional & intense of the In Death series! In this book, Eve is trying to catch a serial sadistic rapist who broke out of prison. In Eve's pursuit of Isaac McQueen (the rapist), Eve and Roarke must travel to Dallas, TX, which is the city that holds a lot of memories regarding Eve's broken childhood. My heart hurt for Eve as she had to deal with horrific aspects of the case involving McQueen as well as her having to come to terms with her past. I definitely was emotional at several points during this book. There was a scene in particular that involved Galahad (her cat) that got me all teary eyed. I definitely didn't expect to get emotional over a scene with her pet!Roarke as usual was amazing. He did his best to support Eve and to take care of her physically and emotionally when she wasn't taking care of herself. He also provided some comic relief as well.There was one scene where Roarke prepared a bath for Eve, and knowing her so well; Roarke made the water temperature very hot. Eve invites Roarke to join her and this is part of the conversation that followed:Eve: \"It's not that hot\"Roarke: \"If I had a lobster, we'd boil it and eat it.\"Eve: \"You set the temp.\"Roarke: \"So I did, and now, with no lobster in sight, we're boiling my balls.\"Overall, I would give this book 5 stars! It was full of suspense, character growth, a HUGE plot twist that I didn't see coming, and definitely lots of love :)**One of my favorite quotes**Eve: \"For two people who started out so fucked up, we're okay.\""}, {"userName": "\u269c\ufe0fTrea", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5223520-trea", "userReview": "Oh, my, gosh! I literally could not put this book down! It was amazing! It kept me on the edge of my seat and had me running the spectrum of emotions! I loved that we got so much resolution in this book, even though that resolution led to more issues for Eve herself. I loved how far this book pushed Eve out of her comfort zone, and showed the dichotomy between her homicide teams and other teams in the Police fraternity. The bonds of Eve's relationship with Roarke were also tested here, and I believe overall that they came out stronger for it. I think this is the strongest book in the series so far, and this story will have far reaching impacts on the Eve Universe for years to come."}, {"userName": "Under the Covers Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35433419-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "NEW YORK TO DALLAS is book 33 in the In Death series and it is by far the most intense one of the series. When Eve was just a rookie, she had an encounter with Isaac McQueen, a man who was a murderer and pedophile. When McQueen escapes prison and returns to his apartment again, seeking Eve out, she has no choice but to return to her past. The pages of this book are super intense and I had the creepy crawly feelings all throughout as I read it. There was something very scary and disgusting about McQueen that I really, really hated and as a result, he made for a very good villain.Like I mentioned before, this book is by far the most intense book in the series. With it\u2019s fast-paced writing and roller-coaster emotions, be sure to clear the rest of your schedule when you read this book. I read it quickly, drawn in by the writing and the intense mystery plot. I tend to have a lot of favorite books in this series, but I would definitely say that this particular one is probably in my top two. I\u2019m so glad that I got a physical personalized copy because it will definitely be a prize possession displayed on my bookshelves.*Reviewed by Annie\u2764 \u2661 Don't want to miss any of our posts?

And Roarke sure isn't experiencing a picnic with all the dirty looks and nasty comments he's getting from the Dallas PD. At least until he proves his lightning skills with a computer! Then there's the psychological trauma Eve is experiencing with McQueen's partner and her real identity. The discovery [on our part] that Eve first started to remember her childhood trauma when she forced open that door on McQueen's apartment all those years ago. Thank god for Dr. Mira! She really helps Roarke and Dallas come to an understanding. I did love Commander Whitney's slam on the prison officials...go, dude!I think the reason I didn't give New York to Dallas a 5 is because it's just too easy for Eve to take over the investigation in Dallas. Yeah, I love that everyone saw that she is the best person to be in charge, but it just seems such an unlikely realization. Cops have always seemed very territorial in all the books and TV shows...yeah, yeah, I know...fiction is not real-life, but still. I am surprised that Roarke doesn't feed everyone...With all the talk of how both their pasts affects how people see them, I have to wonder if Robb is setting us up for Eve leaving the NYPSD. I did enjoy Eve's comment about Roarke and his Empire of Everything!The StoryIt starts with Peabody, Dallas, and Detective Strong receiving medals for their part in taking down the corrupt cops from Treachery in Death on the same day they learn that Isaac McQueen, pedophile and serial killer, has escaped prison. He's murdered a doctor and taken Tray Schuster's girlfriend prisoner. The girlfriend's lucky. She was only raped and carved into.Unfortunately, McQueen has done his homework and he wants to torture Eve and where better than Dallas, Texas where Eve's real life began. McQueen starts with an old victim, Melinda Jones. She had had the brass to show up at his prison cell and tell him off. Now he's getting the last laugh when he re-carves his signature in her chest. Both the Jones girls turned their experiences around: Melinda became a social worker specializing in rape and abuse cases while Bree became a cop. Together they've moved forward. Until Sister Suzan and McQueen take their world apart.The CharactersLt. Eve Dallas is a New York Homicide cop who is determined to stand for the dead and find justice for them. Eve has put a lot of perps away over the years including a nasty serial killer shortly after she graduated from the police academy. Roarke is her very sexy, empathic husband strong enough to stand beside her and her decisions and strong enough to hold her when the abuse she endured from her pedophile father gets in the way. Galahad, their cat, also plays an important role in this one.Eve's crew makes a brief appearance: Baxter, Trueheart, Carmichael, Feeney, Ian, and Peabody along with Commander Whitney while Peabody's parents, Roarke, Charles and Louise, Summerset, Crack, Mavis, baby Bella, and Leonardo, Trina, and Nadine Furst all showed up for the award ceremony.Dallas, Texas, PDLt. Ricchio is the head Dallas cop and amazingly cool with Eve taking over\u2026he can see what an incredible cop she is. The FBI agents, Nikos and Laurence, are a mixed bag. Nikos has a huge chip on her shoulder and appears to be in charge while Laurence is the real power behind the badge with a realistic appreciation for Dallas and Roarke.Isaac McQueen is a serial killer and pedophile whom Eve caught in her first months out of the Academy. He's escaped from prison and is determined to take Eve down. Sister Suzan Devon, a.k.a., Sylvia, a.k.a., Stella is McQueen's partner in Texas and, hoo boy, what a mess this woman is. Melinda Jones and Detective Bree Jones were both the last victims taken by McQueen before Eve followed her instincts and freed them. Thirteen-year-old Darlie Morganstern is McQueen's latest victim.The Cover and TitleVery cool electric blue cover of a nightlit Dallas skyline with the title poppin' as an airline announcement in black rectangles and yellow LEDs.A title that sends Eve from New York to Dallas in so many ways. I do love the vignette of the plane filled with the Dallas skyline!"}], "description": "The number-one New York Times-bestselling author J. D.
