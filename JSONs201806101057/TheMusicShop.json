I was born in 1985, so technically, I am a child of the 90s, but I think that these two decades share the same spirit of a certain kind of innocence, before the coming of the new millennium and all the \u2018\u2019gifts\u2019\u2019 it brought (yeah, right\u2026) I\u2019m not a big fan of the music that conquered the 80s, but when I happen to listen to a chart-hit of the era, I travel back to my childhood and the parties when we were 9-10 years old.Joyce pays homage to the beauty of the vinyls, the nostalgia that is connected with them, before the shiny CDs took over. Personally, I never liked cassettes, although God knows we had more than we could count. In this story, we find ourselves in London, during the last years of the 80s and in a music shop that sells vinyls exclusively. Frank, the owner, is surrounded by a quirky set of characters who aid him in his struggle to keep the spirit of the neighbourhood alive against modernity. One day, a lovely young woman, wearing a green coat and with her hands hidden in gloves, faints right outside his shop. And his life begins to change.Now, the blurb may make us think that this is going to be a light, carefree read. Essentially, a romance. It isn\u2019t. Not entirely, at least. And most definitely, it is not a romance. It is a story that contains a heart-warming, tender, well-constructed relationship, but to call it a \u2018\u2019\u2019romance\u2019\u2019 wouldn\u2019t do it justice. In my opinion, this is Contemporary Quirky Fiction at its best. (...I just made up a genre in order to justify my silly definition, but anway\u2026) Each character, from Frank to Ilse, to the various customers who have been helped by him, is integral to the story. There are personal stories of sadness and pain, of hope and joy and remembrance, people trying to soothe their wounds and keep the memories alive through music. This is what Frank regards as his mission.The characters of Frank and Ilse are the best example of how an author can create a romantic relationship that will touch even the sworn enemies of anything romance-related (...that is moi\u2026) Frank is loyal to his job, somewhat a loner in the extreme, and perhaps a bit too empathetic and stuck to the past. A realistic protagonist that you wish you had as your friend back in that day. Ilse is sensitive, bright, kind and with a heavy dose of mystery trailing behind her.Initially, I thought there would have been an element of magical realism in her, that\u2019s how ethereal and mysterious she seemed. Father Anthony (loved him to piece, he is everything a priest is supposed to be), Kit and Maud consist Frank\u2019s \u2018\u2019gang\u2019\u2019 and they are as sympathetic and weird as you can get. Maud wasn\u2019t much to my liking, I didn\u2019t have any sympathy for her attitude, but to each their own\u2026I am a bit of a potty-mouth myself, but she seemed to be continually disrespectfulJoyce writes in a manner that is immediate, fresh and lyrical at the same time. She provides a treat for every lover of music. At the mention of every composer, every singer, every band, I could hear the notes partying (or waltzing or praying) in my head. I was reminded of all the extraordinary music creations the human mind has conceived. Even the quality pop-rock of the 1980s and the 90s...So it triggers a major level of nostalgia for an era when a singer didn't have to appear on stage, dressed only in the underwear or in a meat-dress in order to become famous or to make up for the lack of any talent. I give extra points for the reference to \u2018\u2019Beata Viscera\u2019\u2019, my favourite hymn to the Virgin Mary. Also bonus points for what I consider the most beautiful piece to come from Iceland, 'Heyr, Himna Smi\u00f0ur'.For me, the major question of the novel has to do with the strength of our principles. Frank refuses to go with the flow, if it means betraying his ideals and all he is living for.Why should modern times demand of someone to become an altogether different person? Why should we offend what we don\u2019t agree with and look down on those we consider \u2018\u2019old school\u2019\u2019? This is very relevant in our current times with politics, religion, society in general. Some of us stick to certain values. If others consider it \u2018\u2019Ancient History\u2019\u2019 that\u2019s all very well, but respecting different opinions should be a bidirectional thing. So, as you see, this book definitely gives you plenty to think about.This is a book that will appeal to practically everyone. The music lovers, the fans of the 80s, the followers of the vinyls, the Londonphiles, the readers who wish for a contemporary read with something to say and themes we can all relate to. I even forgave the somewhat \u2018\u2019cheesy\u2019\u2019 ending:)\n\u2018\u2019I heard the things you told me. The birds and the storm and a dog barking. I heard a summer day.Thunder. I heard the wind. People slipping on ice, and then falling asleep by the fire.\u2019\u2019\nMany thanks to Random House and NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "The Music Shop by Rachel Joyce is a 2018 Random House publication. A quirky, but sweet love story wrapped inside a loving ode to music-I love stories like this one where a group of people, from various walks of life, all of whom are misfits or eccentric in one way or another, but are kind and giving souls, converge to create a delightful and unique tale of friendship and love.  The music shop is the absolute perfect backdrop for such a story, reminding us of how important a role music, of all kinds, plays in our lives. The story is set in the mid-eighties, in London, where Frank has set up an indie music shop, in a neighborhood struggling to survive in rapidly changing times. As the story opens, we watch in fascinated awe as Frank shows off his unique talent of choosing just the right song for his customers, even if they are initially skeptical. He is never wrong and wins the utmost respect of his clients, who have discovered artists and songs they never would have otherwise, thanks to Frank. But, an ominous threat is hanging over Frank\u2019s shop- CD\u2019s. While vinyl is being aggressively shoved out of the way in favor of compact discs, Frank steadfastly refuses to sell them. He pays a high cost for his stubbornness as fewer people will work with him or they charge him more money for their products.But, life will turn on a dime, when a woman faints in front of his shop. Her name is Ilse Brauchmann, and she cast an uneasy charm on Frank, his shop, and in fact the entire neighborhood. From here, the reader will watch as Frank and Ilse form a wobbly relationship that slowly develops into something much more substantial. But, despite the sincerity and strength of those feelings, old abuses and disappointments may stymie their development and growth. Can they admit their feelings for each other or will unforeseen circumstance tear them apart for good? Movies often release soundtracks, so why can\u2019t we do the same with books? How cool would that be? This book has a definitive musical backdrop that would make a great addition to anyone\u2019s playlist, especially if you love the eighties. The music fit perfectly alongside the eccentric, damaged, and wounded souls in this story, who fight on moral grounds, who were like a family, despite their eccentricities. Some people adapt and change with the times, accepting the inevitable, while others fight against it with nobility, even if it ends up in futility. Yet, there are occasions, despite the odds, they still manage to carve out a niche for themselves, never having to sacrifice their own convictions. Frank was like that, and I admired his tenacity, in standing up to corporate pressure the way he did. I loved all the characters featured in this story, all of whom were flawed in some way, all with heavy burdens to bear, making it easy to sympathize with them. While the story has that oddball quirkiness to it, that whimsical and nostalgic quality that feels so charming, wry humor and a few laugh out loud moments, there is a dark undertone to the story, that our brain acknowledges, but it is so offset by the tone, the bark feels worse than the bite, but it hangs in the air like a thundercloud that refuses to dissipate. It does seem to take an inordinately long time before the sun finally pokes through those clouds. There was one issue I had with the story, which was the whiplash inducing slamming on of the brakes to one section of the story, disrupting the continuity- which left me feeling disoriented for a time. The momentum that had steadily climbed to that climactic moment, almost tanked. I felt like I had lost something significant in that vacuum of time. The warp speed of the last quarter of the book almost choked the life out of the hard- earned love and fragile emotions the reader had steadily built up to that point. However, the story did rally in a come from behind win, earning some redemption points with a sweet and tender conclusion that left me with all the warm and fuzzy feels. Ultimately, this is an offbeat, feel good story, and heaven knows we could all use more of those!! 3.5 stars rounded up"}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "This is a wonderful novel set in the late 1980s London, that evokes the culture and music of the era, and the economic decline hitting local communities and the ever encroachment of developers threatening the identity of a place, and its people. In the midst of the change taking place is Frank, running his Indie Music Shop, welcoming everyone and drawing an offbeat crowd. The CD has taken off, but Frank is not interested, preferring vinyl, in which there is a current resurgence. Amidst the growing closure of local businesses, Frank stands by the strength of his convictions, an idealist in Thatcher's Britain that is geared to crushing idealism with its gods of ruthless capitalism and grasping consumerism. Frank is a kind and compassionate man, with a magical gift of honing into the piece of music his customers need, rather than what they may be wanting.German Ilse Brauchmann faints outside Frank's shop, she is destined to rock Frank's world. Ilse is a woman with secrets, getting married, dresses in green and is never to be seen without her gloves. We get a real sense of community as a raft of stories are unveiled about those who visit the store such as the bank manager, that include loss and other troubles that music helps and resolves, all thanks to Frank. Ilse's entry into Frank's life brings back his memories of Peg, his eccentric mother responsible for initiating and informing his unsurpassed musical knowledge. His problematic relationship with Peg haunts him. Frank gives music lessons to Ilse in a cafe, with a waitress that becomes invested in the blossoming love affair between the couple. Frank struggles to express his feelings to Ilse, which is ironic given how effectively Frank tunes into the feelings of others. This is a tale inhabited with a wide array of quirky characters, Maude the tattooist, Father Anthony, Kit and others, that charm and beguile. Frank and Ilse's relationship founders, years pass until Ilse returns to a changed landscape and people. Is it possible that love can be resurrected against all the odds with the power of music?Rachel Joyce writes a love letter to all that music can be in this lovely novel. It is a story of loss, love, pain, friendship, and community solidarity. A community that tries to support Frank, after he has helped them despite the wrecking ball to community support that are the developers in London. Above all else, it is about the healing power of music, its capacity to unite, ease trauma, evoke and access memories, inspire and help address our deepest needs. It forces Frank to connect with his past and with his feelings. It highlights how music is nothing without the silences, which have a power of their own. Joyce has a knack for creating a range of characters which cannot fail to engage the reader. Additionally, the book is bound to serve as an education in music to many readers from the classical composers, to Aretha, and to the inimitable Sex Pistols and so much more. An engaging and entertaining book.

I have the largest iPod Apple ever made, and it doesn't accommodate my entire music collection\u2014how can I get rid of a song?For me, music is such a trigger of emotion, and a specific song can easily transport me to a time, a place, a special memory. So why it took me so long to read Rachel Joyce's lovely \nThe Music Shop\n, I'll never know.\"Frank could not play music, he could not read a score, he had no practical knowledge whatsoever, but when he sat in front of a customer and truly listened, he heard a kind of song. He wasn't talking a full-blown symphony. It would be a few notes; at the most, a strain. And it didn't happen all the time, only when he let go of being Frank and inhabited a space that was more in the middle. It had been this way ever since he could remember.\"Frank owns a record shop on a rapidly deteriorating, dead-end street in a London suburb. It's the late 1980s, and vinyl is struggling to survive over cassettes and the increasingly popular CD, but Frank is a purist. He'll never sell anything other than records, despite the reps from the different labels trying to convince him that he's making a huge mistake. Vinyl sounds the best, and provides so much more of an experience for the listener.Even though his store, and the other stores that surround it, isn't doing that well financially, the store serves as a gathering place for people in the neighborhood, people who come to Frank in need of help, and he finds them the exact song they need, even when they don't know it. Into this chaos one afternoon comes a beautiful woman, Ilse Brauchmann. Frank feels an instant connection to her, with her regal bearing and her slight German accent. He finds himself thinking of her constantly, yet Ilse talks of a fianc\u00e9e, and clearly has secrets she doesn't want to divulge.Nearly all his life, Frank has never let anyone get too close to him, for fear of getting hurt as he had in his past. But he has fallen head over heels in love with Ilse, despite the fact that he knows next to nothing about her. When she asks him to give her music lessons, after some initial reluctance, he dives in wholeheartedly, teaching Ilse about all different songs, artists, and genres of music, and sharing the way those songs made him feel. It is the closest he can come to sharing his heart with her.As he tries to come to terms with his feelings, Frank is struggling financially to keep the store afloat, to fight those who refuse to sell him records because he won't buy CDs. He tries to keep his neighbors feeling secure despite the street's falling into greater disrepair, and a development company making everyone offers to buy their property to build something new. When Frank finds out that Ilse isn't quite whom she says she is, it threatens to debilitate Frank for good, as the betrayal opens old wounds and revives old hurts he had never quite gotten past.\"Sometimes all that people needed was to know they were not alone. Other times it was more a question of keeping them in touch with their feelings until they wore them out\u2014people clung to what was familiar, even when it was painful.\"\nThe Music Shop\n is a book with such heart and charm, such vivid characters, and it was truly such a lovely read. Joyce perfectly captures the mood of London in the late 1980s, as the gulf between the haves and the have-nots grew ever wider. She also captures the passion of a true music lover, the beauty of friendship, and the walls we build around our heart to protect ourselves after we've been hurt too many times.As I learned from one of her earlier books, \nThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\n (see my review), Joyce is a consummate storyteller who draws you in and makes you care about her characters. One character in particular, Frank's employee Kit, felt strangely underdeveloped, and you never really understood him despite his key role in the plot.I did feel the story took a little too long to truly get going, and then dragged a bit toward its conclusion. But in the end, even if I wasn't surprised by the ending, the book really touched my heart, and the music lover in me savored every note. \nThe Music Shop\n is one of those books that felt like a warm hug, kind of like Gabrielle Zevin's \nThe Storied Life of AJ Fikry\n.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html."}, {"userName": "Miriam Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35740838-miriam-smith", "userReview": "What a delightful and enjoyable read \"The Music Shop\" by Rachel Joyce is! It doesn't demand constant attention or keep you awake at night, it's just a lovely nostalgic story that makes you feel so happy when reading it, it's almost like you're floating through the pages (though the ending did have me in emotional goosebumps). \"The Music Shop\" is a very character driven novel. Set in 1988 the story is about Frank who owns a music shop selling only vinyl records - don't mention Cd's!! He knows everything about music and always finds the right album the customers need. One day a mysterious woman walks into his life - German Ilse Brauchmann - and from then on everything in his world changes.There's some really wonderful characters in this fabulous story from the main protagonist Frank (everyone needs a Frank in their life) to Maud a tattooist who says so little but expresses so much. I loved the developing relationship between Frank and Ilse and with Kit the endearing naive shop assistant added into the mix, things don't always go to plan.There's such a lovely community feel to Unity Street where the shop is located, with its multicultural residents and shop keepers living their simple and uncomplicated lives, where every event or change in routine is picked over and analysed in such a humorous and light hearted way. Customers would go into Frank's shop lost and come out found, having discovered the right music for their troubles and feeling healed.I really enjoyed reading this book, there's nothing to not like about it - without a doubt it's made me feel differently about music and I will certainly be listening to it in a completely new way from now on. Rachel Joyce is a very talented and established author and I look forward to reading more books by her. 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "!! NOW AVAILABLE !!4.5 Stars\n\u201dThere was once a music shop. From the outside it looked like any shop, in any backstreet. It had no name above the door. No record display in the window. There was just a homemade poster stuck to the glass. FOR THE MUSIC YOU NEED!! EVERYONE WELCOME!! WE ONLY SELL VINYL!!\u201d\nThe shop was difficult to navigate with boxes packed in everywhere one looked; every nook and cranny had records, although none were classified. There were two booths for listening with turntables in between. And Frank, as much of a fixture as the records, felt it was best to keep the shop open late into the evening for those passing by in need of music. You could find what you needed, as long as it was on vinyl. And if you didn\u2019t know what you wanted or needed, Frank could always tell exactly what you did need. Stacks of classical, rock, blues, jazz, punk, heavy metal, he carried it all \u2013 as long as it was on vinyl. \n\u201dFrank could not play music, he could not read a score, he had no practical knowledge whatsoever, but when he sat in front of a customer and truly listened, he heard a kind of song. He wasn\u2019t talking a full-blown symphony. It would be a few notes, at the most, a strain. And it didn\u2019t happen all the time, only when he let go of being Frank and inhabited a space that was more in the middle. It had been this way ever since he could remember. \u2018Intuition,\u2019 Father Anthony called it. \u2018Weird shit\u2019 that was Maud.\u201d\nIn 1974, the year Frank bought his shop, Britain was beginning a recession that year, but he didn\u2019t want to quibble over the asking price, and so he bought this place, despite the stench, despite the condition it was in, despite the crumbling masonry falling now and then. He began to tackle the things that needed tackling right away. Slowly, he began to make repairs, plastering walls, repairing pipes, fixing the roof, and replacing the windows. People begin to pop into the shop just to see how it\u2019s coming along, and he begins to know his neighbors better. Word spreads about his shop, and slowly, over time, he builds up a somewhat regular clientele. His customers are amazed that he always seems to know just the right music for them. \n\u201dMusic comes out of silence and at the end it goes back to it. It\u2019s a journey. You see?\u201d\n His mother had told him when he was six. \n\u201dAnd of course the silence at the beginning of a piece of music is always different from the silence at the end.\u201d\n Why? He questioned her. \n\u201dBecause if you listen, the world changes. It\u2019s like falling in love. Only no one gets hurt.\u201d\n By the time his shop is up and running, music has changed. Moved beyond vinyl to 8-track tapes, then cassette tapes, and then, by 1988, came CDs. Shiny, eye-catching and new. But Frank remains steadfast in his determination to keep in the old and blocking the way for those new, shiny objects. In this neighborhood, it feels as though time has marched on, but time seems to have forgotten this neighborhood, these people. Throughout this story are many quirky and endearing characters, but there is one character that really stands out from the rest: Ilse, a young woman who may wear her heart on her sleeve, but that sleeve is made of amour. He first meets her when she faints just outside the door to the music shop. A new person in this neighborhood is worthy of notice, but there\u2019s something about her that sets her apart from them. It\u2019s not just the clothes or the gloves that she wears, it\u2019s not her green coat, or her German accent that sneaks through when she speaks, and she\u2019s just a bit of an enigma. And that difference is something they all seem to find intriguing. There are a host of other characters, Father Anthony, Maud, and Kit, with the occasional glance back in time to Frank\u2019s memories of his mother, Peg. Each character is uniquely charming, even grumpy Maud. There are also those that wander into the shop as a break in their day of wandering the streets.There is a considerable amount of conversation about music, which should be obvious since it is a book that is based on the comings and goings of people in a music shop, but the range of eras and genres of music is fairly eclectic. I loved this, the discussions which were less about music than about the feelings evoked, what the artist was trying to say, to convey to those listening. The description of this book says that it is \u201ca love story and a journey through music,\u201d however there are many different kinds of love stories, as many as there are different songs, and this story deals with more than one way that love is shared. I would say that this is a love story / song to music, and the ability that both music and words have of breaking, and healing, our hearts.In a very basic sense, there\u2019s an essence to \n\u201dThe Music Shop\u201d\n which charmed me as much as her \n\u201cThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry,\u201d\n which I loved. There\u2019s a raw, but not overly sentimental charm to these characters, as well as an emotional journey over time, as well. Like Harold\u2019s followers, you\u2019ll be cheering these characters on in their journeys.

The future\u2019s vinyl,\u2019 he said.. . . \u2018Life has surface noise! Do you want to listen to furniture polish?\u2019Frank is a rumpled older fellow with a large, eclectic collection of vinyl records in a rundown shop in a rundown little side-street in a rundown part of London, which developers are eyeing for new housing.Kit is the clumsy kid he\u2019s taken under his wing to help out in the shop (when he isn\u2019t breaking things), and there ae various side characters who also do business in the street: undertaker, tattooist, you get the idea. There are some people who have lived there for years, and there are some cheap rooms to let. It's a neighbourhood. Yes, it's run-down. Yes the buildings are crumbling. But yes, these people need each other and their homes.Frank\u2019s shelves are arranged in such a way that only he knows where anything is. He sorts his records by putting like with like. The thing is, only Frank know why one piece of music belongs with another, a symphony with an Aretha Franklin along with Johnny Cash or someone.Frank \u2018reads\u2019 people. He doesn\u2019t know how, but he listens, truly listens when they tell him why they\u2019re looking for music \u2013 a breakup, a celebration, a moment of reflection. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for, but Frank does. He might hand them a concerto and a pop song, send them into one of his listening booths (converted wardrobes) and watch their faces light up when they hear their just-right selections.This reminds me of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, with its peculiar collection of books and odd customers, but this is a unique story about some very particular music. We are given snippets of Frank\u2019s growing up with his self-absorbed mother, Peg, a musical genius (in her way). He always call his mother by name.\u201c\u2018Music comes out of silence and at the end it goes back to it. It\u2019s a journey. You see?\u2019\u2018Yes, Peg,\u2019 Though he didn\u2019t see. Not yet. He was only six.\u201dShe loves Beethoven, Handel, Miles Davis. Frank says she crashes through the boundaries like jazz musicians do. She told him\u201cJazz was about the spaces between notes. It was about what happened when you listened to the thing inside you. The gaps and the cracks. Because that was where life really happened; when you were brave enough to free-fall.\u201dPeg\u2019s musical influence obviously soaked deeply into him, and it\u2019s all very well that Frank loves the shop and people love Frank, but it doesn\u2019t pay the bills. Is he doing all right?\u201cFrank said he wasn\u2019t sure. He wasn\u2019t in the red exactly, but he was probably heading (kind of) in that (sort of) general (pinkish) direction.\u201dWhen the mysterious, lovely German, Ilse Brauchmann wanders in, everything changes. I think some readers have made lists of all the music mentioned, and I can see why. I didn't, but I will have to go listen to Miles Davis though. Here\u2019s why.\u201c\u2018This is the record that will change history,\u2019 said Peg. \u2018Why?\u2019 She blew a plume of smoke towards a tea-coloured patch on the ceiling.\u2018Because it takes music to a whole new place. Miles Davis booked all the best players but they had hardly any idea what they were going to play. He gave them outlines, told them to improvise, and they played as if the music was sitting right with them in the studio. One day everyone will have \u201cKIND OF BLUE\u201d. Even the people who don\u2019t like jazz will have it.\u2019How could she be certain?\u2018Because it\u2019s the dog\u2019s bollocks. That\u2019s why.\u2019\u201dGood enough for me!

You might call him the music whisperer with his knack for choosing songs that tend to elevate people depending on their circumstances. Frank owns a music store selling only vinyl records, refusing to go with the popular CD. His talent for knowing just what music will fix what ails other people is fun to watch as lonely, sad people listen to the music he chooses for them and then come to some realization of themselves. Sadly, while Frank can figure out what strangers need, he can\u2019t quite deal with his own feelings. I don\u2019t know enough about music to really know some of the classical or jazz titles but certainly recognized some of songs. This is an ode to music, a sentimental love story, a story of friendship. However, it just fell a little short for me. Harold Frye and Queenie Hennessy, characters I loved from Joyce\u2019s previous novels were the reasons I decided to read this book . But this book just didn\u2019t grab me in the same way and neither did the characters. Chalk it up to expectations that were too high. It\u2019s a quick read with a predictable ending.

So dull... I loved Rachel Joyce's The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy. She has a talent for delving into deep emotions through quirky characters. The Music Shop set off to do the same, but unfortunately I didn't feel like it delivered. In the 1980s, Frank runs a small vinyl record shop. He is huge and sensitive. He has a knack for connecting people with music that soothes their troubled souls. Visitors to the shop adore him. But vinyl is going down the tubes and Frank refuses to get with the times and sell cds. A few other misfits form part of the ensemble, including distressed Ilse, with whom Frank seems to be engaged in a push me pull you awkward tangle. And I won't say more to avoid spoilers but it's not hard to guess where this one ends up heading. Maybe I'm just being grumpy, but unlike her previous books, this time it felt like Joyce's characters were missing emotional depth or originality. I'm not going to give up on her yet, but I hope she gets back in her game next time round.

He refuses to sell CDs even when the distributors all threaten to drop him. He loves music and is able to match a person with the music they need. What he doesn\u2019t think he needs is love. There\u2019s a dry wit to the book. The characters are a group of misfits and oddballs and there\u2019s humor in their dialog and activities. It\u2019s also a well written book. A book that makes you think. When Peg discusses how music is about silence, you just get it. \u201cAnd of course, the silence at the beginning of a piece of music is always different from the silence at the end.\u201d \u201cWhy Peg?\u201d \u201cBecause if you listen, the world changes. It\u2019s like falling in love. Only no one gets hurt.\u201dJoyce manages to really get the time and place. The atmosphere- the grafffiti, the developers trying to buy up the properties, the falling down condition of the properties, is as much a character as Frank, Ilse or Kit. Unfortunately, the book is not consistently interesting. It goes through numerous dry patches where nothing happens. Just when I would begin to think I should stop reading, it would get better and I would decide to stick with it. The memories of Peg talking about music were my favorites. An interest in music is a must for this book. Not just classical, but all. The ending made the dry patches worth it.

The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy still remains my favourite book by this author by far.I liked the setting in the run down music shop in an even more run down area of town. I really liked the time period and I enjoyed several of the characters especially Frank himself and the accident prone Kit. It was unfortunate that I also liked the Singing Teapot waitress more than I did Ilse who I never actually warmed to. The author gets lots of points for her ability to write quirky characters without slipping into stereotypes.This is not a romance by any stretch of the imagination, but the love story is there and is very poignant. A few tears, or at least wet eyes, at the end. There is lots and lots about music and many references, some to pieces or songs I don't know and others I do. I listened to a few online and did not always understand why Frank found them appropriate but then that was his skill not mine!Overall a nice contemporary novel with a great cast of characters, well written and enjoyable to read."}, {"userName": "Nenia \u2728 Queen of Literary Trash, Protector of Out-of-Print Gems, Khaleesi of Bodice Rippers, Mother of Smut, the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention \u2728 Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-queen-of-literary-trash-protector-of-out-of-print-gems-khalees", "userReview": "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestHere's the thing: the concept is great. Frank owns a record store in the 1980s, when records are beginning to be replaced by CDs. He holds fast to his beloved records, falls in love, and his favorite music becomes the soundtrack to his pursuit of the forbidden woman, interspersed with the memories of the music from his childhood, with his tempestuous, eccentric mother.I think Rachel Joyce wanted to write the next HIGH FIDELITY, but she doesn't have the charm or the wit of Nick Hornby. Instead, she writes what I call \"hand-holding fiction.\" Maggie Stiefvater does this, too. The prose is lovely but often overly precious, and everything is explained to you in great detail, as if the author doesn't trust the readers enough to let them figure it out for themselves. We must always be told what a character is feeling, and why, instead of being allowed to infer that ourselves.It's. So. Freaking. Annoying.Another thing that really galled me about this book is the manic pixie dreamgirl element. Frank is lost, adrift, and it's the entrance of a tortured, quirkygirl that grounds him and gives him meaning. I hate the manic pixie dreamgirl trope, because in such stories the heroine becomes a means to an end: a reward to the male character for dutifully completing his character arc. As if that weren't enough, they're both pretentious AF. Frank gives her \"music lessons\" where he mansplains to her for hours about what musicians are good and what the records mean (kindly eff off, Frank), and Ilse is flighty and mysterious and utterly flat, apart from having a fancy accent and fancy clothes.If you ever wondered what the little shits in John Green novels would be like in middle age, pick up this book and satisfy your curiosity, because these characters are totally the little shits in John Green novels all grown up and in the midst of a mid-life crisis.I received an ARC of this book for review. 2 stars"}, {"userName": "Tucker", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39633342-tucker", "userReview": "Rachel Joyce is a master at writing about ordinary people and their often hidden struggles, and celebrating their courage and resilience in the face of those struggles. In \u201cThe Music Shop\u201d she once again writes about those \u201cordinary\u201d people in a clear-eyed, unsentimental, and inspiring manner. The book focuses on a group of seemingly unremarkable people who have businesses on Unity Street. At the center of those shops and of the story itself is Frank and his music shop. Frank has an unusual and magical gift; he can listen to people\u2019s conversations and suggest specific pieces of music to help with whatever difficulties they may be having. As Frank describes it, \u201cSometimes all that people needed was to know they were not alone. Other times it was more a question of keeping them in touch with their feelings until they wore them out\u2014 people clung to what was familiar, even when it was painful.\u201d Because of this gift Frank has devoted customers, but the music delivery business is changing and Frank is unwilling to accommodate those changes. He knows that the totality of the musical experience provided by vinyl records cannot be matched by cassettes or cd\u2019s. (I heartily agree!) When devastating losses occur in Frank\u2019s life, he finds himself unable to cope. He has always been able to rescue others but doesn\u2019t know how to rescue himself. But rescue does occur, and the manner in which it plays out is joyous and heartwarming.In addition to a great story, Rachel Joyce\u2019s knowledge of all types of music, from classical to punk, adds a wonderful sonic dimension to the book. I frequently found myself interrupting my reading so I could find and listen to specific pieces she refers to.

I loved both The Rosie Project and Effect, for example, but have never found myself drawn to the work of Rachel Joyce despite the many rave reviews I have read.Sadly, I found The Music Shop to be so interminably slow that at 50% I had to put this novel down. Maybe as I reader of largely crime fiction and thrillers, I demand more action and momentum in a plot, but this was not so much as a meander as like wading through treacle. I won\u2019t describe the plot as other readers, who I suspect will have enjoyed this more, will do so, but so very little happens and Rachel Joyce manages to drag it out to a soul destroying length. An entire one-hundred-pages is devoted to pondering on a woman with an accent and a green coat who faints outside of Frank\u2019s music shop. Joyce begins her novel in 1988 and lonely Frank with his awkward and unusual upbringing is devoted to serving his customers and giving them the music they need in order to solve their many dilemmas in life. Frank learnt all of his music knowledge through his non-conventional mother, Peg, and there is a huge amount of repetition in this novel as first Joyce shows Frank learning from Peg, before Frank then goes on to deliver the same lesson to a customer. I think the most irritating aspect of Joyce\u2019s writing is that she is so acutely aware that she has captured the niche end of charming contemporary fiction that she deliberately serves up awkward characters with common problems with the intention that there will be something within the pages that strikes a chord with every reader. The problem with doing this, however, is that it entails contrived characterisations and necessitates an overload of saccharine sweet schmaltz to complete the setup. The literary equivalent of pulling teeth. I shall not be reading anymore of Rachel Joyce\u2019s work although I have no quibbles about her writing, just the genre. On a positive note (!), I did learn some very interesting facts about classical music and I suspect if I had continued to the end, I would have learnt about the more modern classics too.

Joyce also highlights the benefits of community and relationships while crafting genuinely wonderful characters that will stay\u00a0with me for a long time.My favorite part of the book is the focus on music and its benefits. Frank, the main character, has a gift of knowing exactly which song will help or appeal to a customer. I also loved the characters; Joyce created such a wonderful group of people that I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know. What didn\u2019t appeal to me as much was the long gap in time between the two parts of the story. I felt that too much time passed for the events to seem realistic.

There are twin brothers with a funeral parlor, a female tattoo artist, a Polish baker, a religious store run by an ex-priest, and the music shop. These business establishments face a row of apartments opposite that have seen better times, along with a corner bomb site that was never redeveloped. The main character in the book is Frank, a staunch devotee of vinyl records with a knack of advising customers of what music they need. They might come into the shop thinking they want Chopin and walk out with Aretha Franklin instead...and be thankful for it. Frank had a wealthy and eccentric mother named Peg (and wanted to be called as such by Frank) who relentlessly taught him a wide array of music along with the personal stories of their composers. It was a fervent passion for Peg which she passed along to her son. Unfortunately, in her eccentricity she deprived Frank of a normal childhood and destroyed the most serious romantic relationship of his young life. These experiences reverberate through Frank over the years along with the music. It lands Frank into his music shop business surrounded by his coterie of interesting workers/friends. Then one day an attractive young woman in a pea green coat peers into the music shop's window and everything changes for Frank. A real estate development corporation is pressuring the shop owners to sell, the record company reps are coming down on Frank because he won't sell CDs or cassettes, and Frank is battling strong feelings for the mysterious German girl that wandered into his shop months ago.

For readers of a certain vintage, all sorts of memories will be invoked by this: \u201cYou ease the record from its cover. It\u2019s years since you\u2019ve held one but you do it without thinking. Slide your fingers inside the sleeve, careful not to touch the vinyl. Draw it out. Hear the rustle of paper. Balance it in the span of your palm, the outer rim on your thumb, the label on the tip of your middle finger. As it brushes your wrist, feel the soft static kiss of it. Smooth as liquorice and twice as shiny. Light spills over it like water. Breathe in the new smell.\u201d Sweet and funny and moving."}, {"userName": "Malina Skrobosinski", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46824567-malina-skrobosinski", "userReview": "\"Bon appetit\"\nI devoured this enchanting tale created by Rachel Joyce. It was captivating, enlightening, moving, and even exasperating at times. It's not the kind of novel that is overly gratifying... at least not at first... that's where the exasperation comes in, but in the end, I found it to be very rewarding. Meet Frank... Frank is a 40 year old single man that owns a music shop. \"I'm going to help people find music.\" Frank could not play music, he could not read a score, he had no practical knowledge whatsoever, but when he sat in front of a customer and truly listened, he heard a kind of song. Frank was committed to music, but love... that was something he was never going to consider again. \n\"I'm done with all that. My shop is all I need.\"\n Yes, Frank was content with spending the rest of his days in his music shop selling vinyl records and helping people find music. Only fate had other things in store for him... times were changing. Vinyl was no longer being sought after, CD's have become the new way to listen to music. Music reps are encouraging Frank that if he wants to make it in the business, he's got to sell CD's, but Frank's not budging. As if this wasn't enough frustration for Frank, a mysterious German woman faints in front of his shop, leaving him and everyone in the community stunned. She returns later to thank Frank for helping her, and it's then that Frank realizes that he can't \"hear\" this woman... she has no song, she's completely silent to him. Silence was where the magic happened. The story between Frank and Ilse Brauchmann is so unconventional... it's really like nothing else. It's not a classic love tale that you would hope for. It's complicated... but isn't all love? What's so great about this story is that they come together through a love of music. Only they're both broken and with each others help, they find a way through. The cure is in the disease. I really enjoyed the character development in this novel despite the fact that many of the characters were not given very robust roles or titles in the novel. The overall sense of the community on Unity Street really makes the novel come alive with warmth and... well... unity. There was something unique about each character, I enjoyed Maud's feisty and snappy dialogue. Kit, and his clumsy, can't do anything right, but always wanting to get it right attitude. The waitress... such a simple character in the novel, but yet she added so much in those chapters I felt. Those are just to name a few, but the community really does come alive. I'm going to have to check out some of Rachel Joyce's other work. This was such a fun and quick read. I realize it probably won't be for everyone, but if you love music and enjoy a simple (okay, maybe not so simple) love story, then I say give it a chance. I'd like to thank NetGalley, Random House Publishing Group, and Rachel Joyce for allowing me the chance to read this novel in exchange for my review. I really, really enjoyed it!"}], "description": "A love story and a journey through music, the exquisite and perfectly pitched new novel from the bestselling author of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy", "title": "The Music Shop", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26854212-the-music-shop", "average": 3.84, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1503590162l/26854212.jpg", "reviews": 1721, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5309857.Rachel_Joyce", "name": "Rachel Joyce"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Music", "Contemporary", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26854212-the-music-shop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31348215-the-music-shop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34203744-the-music-shop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35103141-the-music-shop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32614368-the-music-shop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35818806-the-music-shop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31869154-the-music-shop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13227454-the-unlikely-pilgrimage-of-harold-fry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20890479-the-love-song-of-miss-queenie-hennessy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17192373-perfect", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19191545-a-faraway-smell-of-lemon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24909831-a-snow-garden-and-other-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
