The main character is immature, spoiled, obnoxious and needs a one-way ticket to military school. In fact, it was really difficult to relate to any of the characters of Double Vision or their situation, a plot which jumps from topic to topic with no real rhyme or reason."}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "First things first: I need to mention I received this book in Goodreads giveaway. A 12-year-old Lincoln (Linc) Baker is a big troublemaker. I admit some of the things he comes up on his field trips would not even cross my mind when I was 12. On his trip to chicken farms he finally got over his head when he released chickens from their cages. The ungrateful birds attacked him; some kind sole from his class made a movie out of this and put in on Youtube. The farmer sued his family for a million dollar damage. Some of CIA people saw the movie with chickens and realized Linc looked exactly like their agent who disappeared and who is supposed to make an exchange with a crime boss. So now Linc has a choice: to play a substitute, or see himself expelled from school and his parents broken as a result of his stunt with chickens. Simple enough choice, is not it? Well, things go wrong from the beginning, and the situation is getting worse. This is definitely a children book; some of the things seem absurd from adult point of view (12-year-old super-agent, really?). However, the book was entertaining enough for me as an adult whose childhood is long gone. It would be almost impossible for me to stop reading had I found this book during my early teens. The books is entertaining, hard to put down. Solid 4.5 stars with 0.5 added for this book being the first one from the author."}, {"userName": "Julienne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71211973-julienne", "userReview": "A really good book!

Lincoln Baker is a normal twelve-year-old boy. He likes skateboarding and hanging out with his friends. He's bright, but not a terribly great student. And he's impulsive, especially on field trips. During a trip to a chicken farm, he frees the birds with disastrous results.He's been suspended from school, and his parents (not terribly well off) are being sued by the farmer. But there may be a way out. Two agents show up on his doorstep and want Linc to pose as a missing agent, a missing kid super agent, who Linc just happens to look exactly like. Through some sneaky maneuvers, the agents convince the Bakers to let Linc join them for \"boot camp.\" Instead, he's off to Paris after a crash course in all things Benjamin Green, agent extraordinaire. Of course, the one short assignment turns into a race around Paris, a search for a shady Da Vinci painting, dealing with a French family with a big secret, dodging bad guys galore and solving puzzles and ciphers.The book is being marketed for Middle-Grade Reluctant Readers. I think it hits the mark. The pace never bogs down, the mystery is fun to follow, and the characters are well-drawn. Not so reluctant readers will enjoy it, too. And so will more than a few parents.Linc's voice is fresh, funny and real. He's a typical kid with a sarcastic edge but a great heart. This is a fun start to what promises to be a wonderful series of adventures. I've recommended it to several friends with children in the age range."}, {"userName": "Mark Pryor", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5397106-mark-pryor", "userReview": "I didn't read this book, my son did.

It really has been, as far as I can tell, the best book he's read. It was also fun for me, as a parent, to lie on his bed with him at night and use the codes to crack the riddles within the book.

Every night when it was time to close the cover they'd both whine and beg for one more chapter. I finally learned to close the book one chapter early so I could say yes to their request for more.Linc is a great character - we all loved watching him go from having \"Linc Disasters\" that nearly ruined his life, to creating \"Linc Disasters\" that saved his skin.Francoise and Henry were great sidekicks. As the mother of 2 daughters, I always love seeing fiesty, intelligent girls on the page! And Henry is the perfect geek - We loved his Benjamin Green fanboy start and his Agent Q like knack for inventing spy gadgets.Double Vision combined the best of James Bond, the Da Vinci Code and pitch perfect kid voice and feel. There was enough danger to keep the tension high, and just enough violence to keep it real. Actions had consequences, and those consequences just brought the tension higher as we wondered how Linc would wiggle his way out of his latest mess.The humor in the book is spot on and had my girls giggling more than a few times.While this book is definitely a \"boy book\" - my daughters still really enjoyed it. They loved the action, the mystery, the code breaking and the edge-of-your-seat adventures.My kids also loved the Paris backdrop. It's a place that has been on our \"to see\" list for a couple of years now, and my kids have made me promise that when we go we'll bring Double Vision with us and read it again.

These are problems that the top-secret special ops team, Pandora, can make disappear--if Linc can successfully impersonate their top junior agent, Benjamin Green, who's gone missing. The mission: travel to Paris to rescue Jacques M\u00e9g\u00e9re, who's been taken captive by a criminal organization for hiding an evil Mona Lisa that can create mass hypnosis. Linc may be a dead ringer for Benjamin Green, but he doesn't have a black belt in karate and can't run five miles at Olympic speed. His cover is blown quickly--by both tech-genius Henry (who also appears to be Benjamin Green's biggest fan) and Jacques's feisty daughter, Fran\u00e7oise. Run-ins and switch-ups with the real Benjamin Green keep readers turning the pages, while the codes and ciphers keep them guessing.F.T.

It was funny. It was exciting and complicated in a fun way. There were some great surprises and I like how nervous I got for Linc, but he turned out to be smarter than he thought he was. I think I like reading about scary adventures more than I want to have them.\"As soon as she had closed the back cover, she immediately asked if we could go out and buy the next installment of Lincoln Baker's adventures.

(I'd mentioned I was reading a book he might be interested in and he stole it right out from under my nose.) The reason I mention this is because there were a couple moments in which I, as an adult reader, had some trouble accepting certain aspects, like CIA agents dropping in on parents and feeding them a random story about how Linc - their son - was a punk who needed boot camp...and then go on to recruit their son into a super-spy lifestyle. Kinda defies logic. HOWEVER.I am an adult. And nowhere was this made more clear to me than when my 10-year-old son snatched the book away and proceeded to read it cover-to-cover in the space of a day. He came back to me and told me he loved it. I asked him what he loved about it. His answers: action, adventure, twists and turns! He liked the surprises. (Who is really the bad guy? Etc.)I wanted to ask him - what about the chickens (read the book)? Do you really believe that CIA agents would show up at a house and recruit a kid? In short, I wanted to ask him all of the adult questions that an adult reader demands of a book. I sat back down with the book - now that I was allowed to have it. I contemplated it. I started it again and tried to imagine myself as a ten-year-old boy. Then I saw it: this book has everything kids like:1. A smart, funny main character. Linc reminds me very much of Ash on Pokemon. (Bear with me.) Ash has left his family in search of adventure and training. He's off exploring the world on his own terms and he has a good heart. Linc leaves his family - to help them. He doesn't want his folks to suffer. The choices he makes are based on his internal compass. 2. The classic \"You are chosen for something important.\" Every kid - I don't care who they are, where they come from or whatever - wants to be special. They want to be part of something bigger than themselves. Harry in Harry Potter wants to be loved and accepted. Kids live vicariously through heroes like this. Linc has been chosen to beat bad guys and right wrongs. That's fun stuff. 3. Hero's journey! I mean, come on, Luke had to leave Tatooine - Dorothy had to leave Oz - Frodo had to leave the Shire. Linc has to leave the U.S. for Paris...and kids can actually aspire to go there. 4. Twins/lookalikes. Sweet Valley High and all the spinoffs went for years. Parent Trap. Nuf said.So, it turns out - despite my hesitant start - I really enjoyed this book. Kinda harkens me back to afternoons of cartoons. Over-the-top, just-for-fun fun. ~JennyP.S. Every year my son's school allows Halloween costumes...if the costume is of a character in a book. My kiddo has chosen to go as Linc.

When he and his friend Daryl \"accidentally\" let out a bunch of chickens when their class is on a field trip to a chicken farm, it's the last straw. The farmer wants to sue his family (which is struggling already), the school wants to expel him, and he's an international sensation on YouTube with bird poop on his head. This draws him to the attention of \"a top secret special ops team called Pandora\" that realizes he is a dead ringer for one of their kid agents, Benjamin Green. Ben is missing in France, where a \"evil Mona Lisa\" has been stolen from a baker's family. This painting can hypnotize crowds of people, and Pandora is worried that it will fall into the wrong hands. Linc's parents are told that if he goes into a \"boot camp\", he'll be off the hook for damages, and he is whisked off to France, quickly trained, and plopped smack dab in the middle of intrigue and adventure. Francois, the daughter of the baker HATES Ben, because she feels he is responsible for her father's disappearance. The two are able to follow clues that the father leaves, and uncover double agencts, double crossing, and a lot of danger!Strengths: This book did not wast a minute sucking me in. The field trip is short but disastrous, I could believe the agents' excuses and his parents' submission in letting him go. Even the kid agents and quick training seemed plausible. Pitch perfect for middle school boys. Definitely ordering a copy.Weaknesses: I'm not a huge fan of clue oriented mysteries, and this does have a path of clues that have to be found and followed, but it wasn't belabored.

AND BEFORE you start expecting stuff about Greek gods or me being bitten by a spider that turned me into some kind of superhero\u2014sorry to disappoint you. This isn\u2019t one of those stories. At least my field trip wasn\u2019t to a museum, but it wasn\u2019t anywhere cool like Universal Studios either. I go to Lompoc Middle School in California, where expectations are high, but the budget is low. So for our field trip, we went to a chicken farm. Which actually turned out to change my life.What a great opening paragraph that is, Esteemed Reader. I could spend the whole review talking about it (don't worry, I won't). It hooks the reader in the last sentence with a straight throat grab. Less subtle openings get set aside:) The reader has to wonder how a trip to a chicken farm can change someone's life. But more important than establishing setting, which Bradley does, smoothly, this opening paragraph establishes tone (and possibly voice, though the way editors talk about voice sometimes, I'm not sure I know what voice is anymore or if I ever did).So 12-year-old Lincoln Baker, or Linc, is at a chicken farm with his sixth-grade class, in a scene written with amusing descriptions, such as:One of the chickens made a noise and pooped. Then another did the same: chirp, then poop. Chirp, poop.I'm not going to spoil it for you, but in a hilarious episode, Linc manages to be swarmed by chickens and the whole thing ends up on YouTube. Linc lands himself in big-time trouble as Farmer Johnson hires some big shot lawyers and threatens to sue his poor (formerly middle class, I'm sure) family for everything they've got. And, of course, Linc's in trouble at home. Witness how Bradley tells us about her protagonist while expertly rooting the exposition in conflict as Mom deals out the punishment:Mom had just come off her shift when we got home around one, and she was waiting in my room, ready to let me have it. I\u2019ll save you the whole Linc-Is-in-Trouble-Again speech, because if you\u2019ve ever been in trouble, you know what those sound like.  Here\u2019s the recap. 1. I was grounded for the rest of the year (it was November, but still). 2. No TV, even though all these new shows are on (an argument that fell on deaf ears with Mom). 3. No skateboarding (my sole mode of transportation). Not that it mattered\u2014see number one. 4. No going over to Daryl\u2019s, who has an Xbox, unlike me. So no video games, even if I just got to level five on Racing Mania Seven (another argument that fell on deaf ears).It's all fun and games until secret government agents show up. They've seen Linc's chicken antics on YouTube (tax dollars well spent) and they have an intriguing proposition:\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I looked at the grainy picture of a kid, in black cargo pants and a black polo shirt. He had dark hair, blue eyes\u2014and he looked just like me, just a lot more serious. \u201cThere\u2019s this blond streak down the front of his hair, but \u2026\u201d\u201cLooks just like you, right?\u201d Agent Fullerton looked excited. \u201cUncanny.\u201d \u201cWhat? Everyone has a double.\u201d I handed the creepy picture back and sat down in one of the plastic lawn chairs. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d \u201cOne of the kids from your class stuck a video of you at the chicken farm on YouTube. Our scanning software has been searching for a match, but we didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be this close.\u201d Agent Fullerton tucked the picture back in his pocket. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make you an offer. The kid in the picture is Benjamin Green. He\u2019s one of Pandora\u2019s top secret agents\u2014and he\u2019s gone \u2026 missing.\u201dI could tell you more, but we all know where this is going right? Lincoln Baker is about to pose as a secret agent on an incredible mission during which he may just save the world! Maybe. But the great thing about Double Vision is you don't know where it's going. All of this happens by chapter 3! Bradley establishes our protagonist and his motivations:Now, this is what you would call an impossible dilemma. Right? I agree to this, and my family\u2019s troubles will be taken care of, but I would put my life in danger. I don\u2019t do this, the Bakers might be bankrupt and homeless.My two favorite things about Double Vision are Bradley's pace and tone. This book moves as fast as Dan Gutman's The Genius Files series, which is perfect for the book's target audience. The twists and turns come fast and Bradley stays one step ahead of the reader to the end. There's an evil Mona Lisa painting (it's complicated) and a whole lot of action and gadgets, which is always an unbeatable combination. What I love is Bradley's use of first person narration to really keep things moving:Now, I know you must be bored with this guy already\u2014I know I was. I\u2019ll give you a quick recap so we can get to the part where I get my first taste of junior agent life and things get interesting.A book in which an ordinary boy suddenly becomes a world traveling agent requires no small amount of exposition, but younger readers don't care. They want action and they want humor. Bradley gives them plenty of both. By having Linc skip the boring parts, she not only picks up the pace, but further establishes character and tone. Here's my favorite chapter ending/opening combination.Chapter Ending:But otherwise, this secret agent training was pretty dull\u2014I mean you\u2019re bored just reading this, right? So I\u2019ll fast-forward to the next day: Monday morning, 7 a.m. That\u2019s when Agent Fullerton showed up at my hotel room just as I was messing up on Henry\u2019s latest who-is-Benjamin-Green quiz. \u201cTime to go,\u201d was all Fullerton said. And that\u2019s when things got dangerous. Fast.Chapter Opening:OKAY, SO MAYBE IT DIDN\u2019T GET DANGEROUS immediately. First, we had to pack, then there was a really long cab ride to the airport, and after that we had to go through security\u2014you get the idea. And I'm going to stop there before I reveal any spoilers. If you love action, and you love funny (who doesn't), you should absolutely move F.T. Bradley's Double Vision series to the top of your list. As always, I'll leave you with some of my favorite passages from Double Vision: Daryl jumped up next to me. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He saluted Mrs. Valdez. Daryl is the kind of guy who always acts like he\u2019s had one bowl of Lucky Charms too many for breakfast.\u201cNo,\u201d I heard Farmer Johnson say. \u201cNobody gets near my chickens.\u201dIF THIS WERE A MOVIE, NOW WOULD BE the part where they play some pumped-up tune, showing me running, sweating, and learning all about Benjamin Green while guzzling energy drinks. But as you\u2019ve probably figured out by now, this isn\u2019t your typical action-hero story. We guzzled orange juice instead of power drinks and ordered room service, too: big stacks of pancakes with extra syrup.Then with a sharp left, he took an alleyway, making us bounce on the cobblestones. The alley was so narrow, it was a miracle Guillaume didn\u2019t lose his side mirrors. A sharp turn made the tires squeal, and I was pretty sure we tipped onto the two right wheels for a second there."}, {"userName": "Ellen Zarate", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29368222-ellen-zarate", "userReview": "Non stop action ensues when Linc, a ne'er-do-well 12-year-old, gets a chance to save his family from a lawsuit he caused with a silly prank.

Somebody that looks like him or her and may even act the same way. Nearly everyone who knows Lincoln, who goes by the nickname Linc, hopes and prays for his parents\u2019 sake that this is not true. Twelve year old Linc has quite the reputation. Some of which he nearly deserves as he has caused a few issues over the years. At other times, he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.Both are at work in the latest fiasco during the recent field trip. Thanks to the incident and the use of social media by one of his classmates, agents Stark and Fullerton are now aware of Lincoln\u2019s existence and his resemblance to a missing agent. They represent \u201cPandora\u201d which is some sort of top secret special operation team connected to the United State government.They have a missing kid agent by the name of Benjamin Green. Despite Linc\u2019s lack of spy skills, lack of athletic skills and other issues, Linc closely resembles the missing agent. After a quick crash course in training, they want Linc to assume the mission Benjamin was on in Paris, France where he went missing and deliver a certain package. If Linc will agree, Pandora in the form of agents Stark and Fullerton will clean up the mess he made during the recent field trip and deal with the financial fallout of those events. It doesn\u2019t take long before Linc is on the ground in Paris and trying to be the missing agent with surprising results.Aimed at readers ages 8-12 this is a fun read that is pure escapism. While the parents remain clueless about the real nature of Linc\u2019s activities and location, readers are taken to the streets of Paris where culture and history await. Readers learn a bit about history and more as Linc and others in the team work the case in the streets of Paris. Double Vision is the start of a new series that, while it reminds one of the classic Hardy Boys and Encyclopedia Brown, clearly is firmly rooted in the 21st century with its use of technology. The use of technology does not get in the way of making the characters - and by extension the readers - think to work through the various clues to solve the case.Short chapters with plenty of action keep the story moving forward while also providing plenty of material for all age groups to enjoy. Linc gets himself into predicaments that will make adults especially parents cringe and laugh at the same time while thoroughly entertaining to 8-12 year old set. This solidly good book has something for both boys and girls with solidly strong writing and plot development.

But first, before I talk about that, I have to share with you about Lincoln Baker. I think F.T. Bradley has been spying on my 13 yr old son. Linc, as his friends call him has what his friends parents call \"Linc Disasters\" and they are not allowed to go with him on his \"exploring\" on field trips. And truly, I don't think Linc wants to do anything wrong. He is just a curious boy. Who might be in need of some medication. Here is what Mrs. Valdez says before they get off the bus at the chicken farm at \"o'dark thirty\" as Linc says.\"And Lincoln.\"That's me. \"Yeah-I mean yes, Mrs. Valdez?\"\"Can I count on you to behave?\" She gave me one of those death- ray looks. Mrs. Valdez had reason to be worried.\"I won't spoil the fun of finding out what he did but suffice it to say he caused some major trouble on two other field trips. And now they are at a chicken farm. Where they are not allowed to see the chickens. Use your imagination. Just to help you, my son, much like Linc, set the fire alarm off at the YMCA when he was 3. I was trying to book his birthday party. They don't care if he was restless. They get really mad. Guess where he didn't have his birthday party. I identify with Ms. Vasquez and with Linc's parents!Linc honestly feels bad about causing trouble. Not about what he did at the chicken farm. He thought it was funny and the chicken farmer deserved it, but he is really sorry for causing trouble for his parents and the lawsuit, well it will wipe them out. He feels very guilty. Until a seemingly miracle drops in his lap.All he has to do is slip into this missing teen spy's place, deliver a package and he's out. Two days tops. And he gets to go to Paris. But nothing is that simple. Soon Linc finds that he is sorely out of shape to be a teen spy, that the missing spy that he bears an uncanny resemblance to seems to be working for the bad guys, and French pastries are the best. Two days turn into a week and the longer it takes to get the missing Mona Lisa, the less chances that the lawsuit against his family will disappear.But, Linc does have two allies, Francoise, the daughter of the original owner and caretaker of the missing Mona Lisa and Henry, the gadget maker. (The gadget maker is always the best, isn't he?) And with their help, he thinks he might be able to outsmart the bad guys, whoever they may be.This is a fun book to read, taking you on a dizzying tour of Paris and a breakneck race to save Francoise's father and the painting from the hands of terrorists. And more importantly to Linc, save his family. Linc is outrageously funny, his situations improbable, but fun never the less, and the complete story is a quick and enjoyable read for adults as well as kids. I highly recommend this series!"}, {"userName": "ACS Book-finder", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12808357-acs-book-finder", "userReview": "Double Vision by F.T. BradleyLincoln Baker is a 12-year old boy who seems to stay in trouble on a daily basis. Linc is a jokester whose antics finally catch up with him on a school field trip. Their teacher, Mrs. Valdez has made arrangements for her class to take a tour of a chicken farm. Only one restriction, Farmer Johnson does not want the students to go anywhere near the barns where the chickens are housed. Well, Linc just can\u2019t resist and encouraged by his friends, he puts his plan in motion. Problem\u2026Linc ends up letting all the chickens out of the barn. Farmer Johnson is furious and hires a lawyer to sue Linc\u2019s parents for the cost of damages to the chickens and the farm.Linc\u2019s parents are your normal, middle-class family and certainly can\u2019t afford a million dollar lawsuit. They are still recovering from Linc\u2019s last trouble. When some government agents show up on Linc\u2019s doorstep offering a way to make the lawsuit disappear, Linc says yes and the government agents convince his parents to send him to \u201creform camp for trouble makers.\u201d Turns out that these secret agents need Linc\u2019s help because he looks exactly like one of the junior spies, Benjamin Green, who has gone missing. They need Linc to recover a package that could threaten national security.Linc is suddenly thrown into the world of espionage and travels to France for a meeting that the real Junior Agent Benjamin Green was supposed to keep. While Linc may look like Benjamin Greene, he is definitely not a secret agent. Along the way, Linc must use his own special \u201cjokester\u201d skills to avoid capture and meets some very interesting people. With the help of a young girl named Francoise, Linc works to recover the package and solve the mystery of the missing Benjamin Green.This was a really good read. While targeted for the age group of 8-12, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was fast pace without losing the reader and I thought the antics of the main character were very much in line with what a lot of 12-year olds might actually try. Apparently this is the first book in a triology, and I look forward to reading the other two books. I easily recommend this book!DISCLOSURE: We received a complimentary copy"}, {"userName": "S.W.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7369242-s-w", "userReview": "A cool mix of action and adventure.Ever since I first saw this book I\u2019ve wanted to read it. So, I waited for ages for the ebook to be available for me here in Australia. No such luck. I finally put an end to the waiting and ordered a paperback copy from the Book Depository in the UK (It was a great deal with free postage). And I have to say that I\u2019m very glad that I decided to grab a copy, because I loved this book.Linc is a normal kid, who has a talent for causing mayhem without even trying. One day, his mayhem has some pretty serious repercussions on his family and it looks like everything is taking a dive because of him. Then, everything changes. His uncanny resemblance to a high performing kid spy becomes his ticket to an amazing adventure, and hopefully a solution to the problems he\u2019s brought upon his folks.Without giving away too much of the plot, Linc embarks on a top secret mission to recover a priceless piece of art that could fall into the wrong hands. Far from the quiet streets of his hometown, he finds himself on a thrilling adventure through Paris solving hidden clues with his new friend, Francoise.In a way, this book reminded me of a Da Vinci Code for kids, without the murders and dark themes. Just an urgent mission to solve the clues before it was too late. This is one of the most enjoyable books that I\u2019ve read this year. Great job. I\u2019m looking forward to books 2 and 3.In a nutshell \u2026 The plot is great. It has a nice mix of action, adventure and a likeable cast. Twists, turns and the suspicion of double agents had me changing my mind along the way as the mystery unfolded. Highly recommended.Note: I don\u2019t claim to be a pro-reviewer, I am a reader. My reviews are based on my personal thoughts around the story that the book is trying to tell. I try to focus on the story (which is the reason I read) rather than dissect the book and pass comment on typos, writing style or structure."}, {"userName": "Amy_Read to My Heart's Content", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3797236-amy-read-to-my-heart-s-content", "userReview": "Full Review at: http://superreadingkids.blogspot.com/...Mom's Thoughts:Yes this is an children's book but I found myself loving it as well! I would read it out loud to the boys and I would get quiet for a little bit, and then, Conner would say, \" Mom! Stop reading ahead!\" He was right, too! I was reading ahead!The excitement level is very high in this book and it will keep you on your toes. Linc is a wonderful, mischievous, interesting young boy that every child could relate to, especially my twins. He tends to get in trouble because of his class clown status and the fact that he is very curious. I swear the incident with the chickens (both times) had all of us ( even DAD) cracking up. I even seen Conner's eyes twinkle with ideas; so I am definitely not taking him around any chickens anytime soon. But besides all the comedy and interesting exploits Linc tends to make; there is a lot of mystery in this book. That is what kept me so enthralled! It made me think of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code only because of all the clues, puzzles, and tricks the characters needed to solve. In Double Vision, Linc is steady trying to figure out different clues and different puzzles that are taking him around France, trying to get a very special person's father back. This character is my girl! I loved her and I think just including her in this story makes Double Vision fun for girls, boys, and adults too! I loved the character development in the story and I love all the interesting people Linc meets that help him and yet sometimes hinder him too. This book is packed full of action and it truly is hard to only read a few chapters every night. I also had a very hard time not sneaking back and reading the whole book without my boys! I would definitely have to give Double Vision five stars! *****"}, {"userName": "Jm", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17199290-jm", "userReview": "Lincoln Baker est un jeune gar\u00e7on am\u00e9ricain qui a un talent incroyable... pour s'attirer des ennuis !

It was better than Stormbreaker! (You know, the Alex Ryder series?) When I started, this was my main fear that was quickly dispelled: this book would be a book that only young boys could enjoy. Well, as I said before, this fear quickly went away and I became wrapped up in the story.Now, I know the the twin thing has been in a couple books I've read, but that didn't mean that I was bored because of it; the author did an amazing job and managed to keep it new and fresh so that it didn't seem like a bad remake of Prince and the Pauper like most 'we look identical' plotlines. I loved it! It was very interesting to see Ben and Linc interact with each other. The bad guys in this book were also well-written. In many spy stories for kids, it's implied that the bad guys are like the mafia, but ten times worse, and the people end up falling way short of every single expectation. In this book, F.T. Bradley managed to make it believable, yet not so scary that kids would be freaked out by the book. Also, this book was funny! Though a lot of the humor would appeal more to middle-grade boys, there were still parts where I had to giggle. All in all, it was a really good book. I would recommend this mainly to boys ages 7-12, but that doesn't mean that they aren't the only people who can enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Mymcbooks", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5994426-mymcbooks", "userReview": "My Review: Linc couldn\u2019t resist the chance to start some trouble at Mr. Johnson\u2019s chicken farm during a field trip which resulted in a lawsuit.
