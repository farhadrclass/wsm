Chaz has found a lady...or rather a lady friend has found him. Readers will be thoroughly entertained with the Lady & the Tramp'esque love affair between Chaz and Dolores.The Hunger War is the perfect blend of gore, intrigue and kooky romantic comedy. Once again I've got to hand it to Pinkerton for such an outside the box zombie tale.On a side note, I could totally see this being made into a movie. It's got the same quirk that made Isaac Marion's, Warm Bodies such a hit.Blood is spilled, body parts are eaten, zombies make some whoopie...and it all comes together to give readers a delightfully light reading experience sure to leave them with a smile on their face. Pun to cover intended! =) Enjoy!www.bookie-monster.com"}, {"userName": "Teresa Crawford", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7258525-teresa-crawford", "userReview": "Just a fun kooky zombie book about zombies who just really want to be \"free to live\""}, {"userName": "David Watson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6600299-david-watson", "userReview": "Life wasn\u2019t easy for Chaz. He died too young in a construction accident only to be brought back to life by the government as the world\u2019s first smart zombie. The government decided that the experiment was a bad idea and destroyed the lab and tried to exterminate Chaz. Chaz escaped though and accidentally started the zombie apocalypse in New York City. Chaz didn\u2019t ask for this to happen and he\u2019s not sure how to stop it but Manhattan belongs to the zombies now.Being a smart zombie has its advantages, the other zombies are now looking at Chaz as a leader and he may be the one to lead the zombies to a new way of life. Also a second smart zombie named Dolores has found Chaz and together the two will lead the zombies into battle against the humans in the Hunger Wars. Can two zombies in love lead a revolution and find a cure for death? How I started The Apocalypse Book 2: The Hunger Wars has your answers.I loved how this book manages to include action, comedy and horror in the same story. The story starts with a bang as Chaz\u2019s son Peter is running the city streets trying to get supplies for his father, while dodging zombies and trying to escape gun happy humans.The book goes along at a pretty brisk pace with the battle for New York and Dolores\u2019s adventures going from Portland to New York.What I liked most about the book was the humor in it. Like when Dolores and Chaz are sharing a bowl of toes and Chaz remarks that they are out of finger food. I also liked Dolores leading zombies into a bedroom to help some humans escape and commenting to the zombies: \u201cCome and get it, yummy, yummy in your tummy.\u201d Also just hearing Chaz trying to rally the zombies for their battle against humanity was funny and a little scary at the same time.There are also some great moments of horror in this book such as towards the end when a boy spots a zombie in his yard after loosing his mother to one. This book also has a zombie sex scene that will be painful if you\u2019re a guy. In the scene I loved how the guy realizes that even in his current state he is not immortal and while he is falling apart, he\u2019s still not sure he likes the idea of death. All in all I enjoyed this book with some minor exceptions. There was a couple of points where the dialog wasn\u2019t very good. The scenes with Breck Palmer and Chaz\u2019s son seemed unnecessary but I think that was meant to start a future storyline. Also in the middle of the book the story changes directions as Chaz and Dolores try to rescue some humans. At this point I found myself feeling disappointed, I liked where the story was going but towards the end I did like where the author went with it.During the last few pages of the book I found myself thinking it would look great to see this on a movie screen and it set up a third book in the series. I\u2019m hoping the character of Lumpy gets a bigger role in the next book. How I started The Apocalypse is a fun book with a lot of heart and I think zombie fiction fans will really love it."}, {"userName": "Matimate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/198595-matimate", "userReview": "Chaz is back and the this time he is facing the ugliness of the world of living. The previous book was packed with good characters and plot, the second starts good but then it went little bit to the drain. I enjoyed the zombie emancipation and the way how they strive to ehm survive, but this book was somehow with open end."}], "description": "", "title": "How I Started the Apocalypse, Book Two: The Hunger War\n      \n          (How I Started the Apocalypse #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18719473-how-i-started-the-apocalypse-book-two", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1382844123l/18719473.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/288505.Brian_Pinkerton", "name": "Brian Pinkerton"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Apocalyptic", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18719473-how-i-started-the-apocalypse-book-two", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/519809.Abducted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17199501-killer-s-diary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23545306-bender", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16059968-how-i-started-the-apocalypse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1599446.Vengeance"]}
