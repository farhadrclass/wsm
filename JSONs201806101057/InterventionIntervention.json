This is a stand alone novel about a drug intervention and a murder. Ms. Blackstock is one of the few mystery writers who can prevent me from figuring out who committed a crime until she, as the author, chooses to tell me. I found the characters very believable; they were flawed and made mistakes in the midst of a crisis situation just as most of us probably would. If they had made perfect decisions every step of the way it would have seemed unreal. One reviewer found the mother, Barbara Covington, a little bit over the top and annoying. I can understand this reaction to the mother in this novel, but I thought she was a very genuine character whose actions were out of love and desperation for her daughters well being. This was a quick read for me because I didn't want to put it down. It is compelling, interesting reading, and will stay on my bookshelf and be lent to others."}, {"userName": "Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206366-lawrence", "userReview": "Very enlighteningThis book was very enlightening to the hurt and pain of being addictive to drugs in the family. I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to all Terri Blackstock fans."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael", "userReview": "One of my biggest criticisms of contemporary Christian fiction is that while the stories and situations may be compelling and interesting, the characters and their reactions to the situations or chain of events often are not. Too often, you can predict the story arc for each character based on his or her introduction in the novel. You can guess who will be \"saved\" and who won't be early in the story, thus ruining some of the enjoyment of the story and diminishing the authenticity of the novel. (I'm looking at you \"Left Behind.\")So, when a book comes along from the contemporary Christian genre that has not only well drawn, realistic characters but also ones who react in authentic manners, it always draws my attention a bit. That's the case with Terri Blackstock's \"Intervention\"\"Invention\" is the story of widowed mother Barbara and her two children. Her oldest, daughter Emily has embraced the world of drugs and addiction in the wake of her father's death while her younger son, Logan has his own struggles but hasn't quite gone down the same path. In desperation to save her daughter, Barbara enrolls her in a rehab program, complete with an intervention agent who will come and take Emily to the facility so Emily can't talk her mother out of this course of action. The two set off for Georgia but the interventionist is murdered in the parking garage of the Atlanta airport and Emily becomes the prime suspect. Barbara races to Atlanta with her son in tow to try and find Emily, convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt of her daughter's innocence.Blackstock does a nice job of making Barbara feel like a real character over the course of the story. Her faith and prayers are authentic as as her doubts as the evidence begins to pile up. Barbara is not a perfect person or mother and Blackstock allows her to be portrayed as such at several points in the early stages of the novel. However, once the novel hits a certain point and some aspects of what is really going on are revealed that things being to slowly unravel. The last third of the novel depends a lot on Barbara becoming McGyver-like in her ability to get information and do certain things to help track down Emily. Yes, Google is a powerful tool but it certainly shouldn't allow Barbara to get one step ahead of the police in her investigation as is portrayed here. And the revelation of what exactly is going here and why is a bit of a disappointment.It's a shame really because for the first 200 pages, \"Intervention\" is a well crafted, suspense thriller with realistic characters and a horrifying situation."}, {"userName": "Julie Graves", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74167-julie-graves", "userReview": "Barbara Covington is desperate to save her daughter from drug addiction. Emily has been in rehab before and has gone right back to the drugs that she craves. Barbara finally stages an intervention. Trish from Road Back Recovery Center arrives to escort Emily to rehab.When Trish and Emily land in Atlanta Barbara's nightmare begins. Trish is found dead in the parking garage and Emily is missing. Barbara and her son Lance arrive in Atlanta where the police believe that Emily is the one who murdered Trish. Everyone sees Emily as a junkie willing to do anything for her next fix. Only Barbara believes that her daughter is not the cold-blooded killer that everyone believes her to be.When Barbara receives a text from her daughter saying \"mom help me\" she is more than convinced that something horrible has happened to her daughter. Frustrated that the police seem to be doing nothing to help find Emily, Barbara is determined to go out on her own and find her no matter where it takes her.Filled with the anguish and helplessness that a parent must feel when their child sinks into substance abuse the author captures those powerful feelings and emotions in each page of Intervention. At the end of the book Terri Blackstock shares about her own daughter's substance abuse. The feeling of first-hand experience and emotions are apparent throughout the story. The mystery and suspense of Intervention kept me on the edge of my seat. An excellent novel that has me ready to delve into the next book in the series Vicious Cycle."}, {"userName": "Rissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41794459-rissa", "userReview": "She was an addict, going to get help.

I will still read you if you aren't totally religious - but at least I have full warning that you are coming at me with scripture. For instance - um - Jodi Piccoult? I think she has religious tones in her books - but I enjoy them - and I'm ok with that. One of my favorite books was about religion and orphans and blah blah blah blah. It's been a while since I read it. But - again - DISCLAIMER!For the book itself - interesting enough. Who would have thought you would be kidnapped as you were going into a rehab center? I find it difficult to imagine the mothers thoughts. The need to find her daughter vrs the need for her to stay safe for her son. If one of my children went missing, would I be able to sit and wait and hope the police knew what to look for? I don't like how (in general), the non police people always know more than the real police people. Does that give credence to what the mother did? As skinny models teach you that is beautiful, books like this can teach you that you will always find out more than the cops, and no matter how stupid you are, they will be there just at the exact second you need them. I guess I like more where my thoughts went from reading this novel, than anything the novel actually gave me. And I'm not going to lie, I just skimmed all the god crap out.

This was one of the best I've read from her. I really empathized with the characters and cared about their relationships and dilemmas. As usual, Blackstock's faith comes through in the story, but not in a preachy or corny way. She is very good at developing believable Christian and non-Christian characters and doesn't feel the need to have the story be about people getting saved. A lot of Christian fiction (especially in film) falls into that trap, and the effect of the story itself often gets lost or loses its power as the audience begins to feel that it was all just a set up for an agenda. This book is certainly Christian fiction, but it is first and foremost a good thriller of a story. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5158133-valerie", "userReview": "I hated this book. Well, I hatd the character of the mother. While she was portrayed as a mother bear type, willing to do whatever it took to protect her child, I saw her as shrill, pushy, and manipulative and just getting in the way. I tried to keep reading, kept hoping her character would dial it down a little but it didn't happen and I finally couldn't stand it anymore and quit reading.I did, however, end up reading the 2nd book in this series, \"Vicious Cycle\" which I liked a lot, which was surprising.

Her last hope is the beginning of a new nightmare, Intervention is about a Christian mum who has had her fair share of tragedy the last few years and all that seems to be holding her together is the love of her son Lance and the belief that no matter what obstacles she comes across God is always looking out for her. Her daughter, shortly after the death of the father decided to take the road of drugs and alcohol. Barbara is at her last hope and decides that it is time to get her 18yr old daughter Emily the help she needs and hires a professional interventionist, however along the way to the airport Trish (the interventionist) is found dead and Emily nowhere to be seen and becomes the only suspect in the murder of Trish. Barbara and Lance jump on a plane , to prove to the police that her daughter is not a killer , but as time goes by and the levels of panic intensify we are left with the decision of whether Emily\u2019s addiction with drugs led her to kill or is she another victim of the murderer . An excellent written book that will keep you guessing till the end, and in parts your heart will cry out for Barbara and once you\u2019ve finished you will be thanking God for providing the family with the faith to go on and persuade a number of different leads that seemed impossible, but as the scripture says \u201cWith Go as my saviour, anything is possible\u201d. As with the majority of Christian books, Terri has provided us with a discussion section at the back of the book, a list of resources used and a special note from the author. Excerpt from Acknowledgements:\u201cThis book was a special labour of love, because I firmly believe that our culture is killing our kids. This story is fictional, but unfortunately, its truths apply to many families across the world today. To those who are trapped in the bondage of addiction, it\u2019s your story too. The hill you\u2019re climbing may look insurmountable, but Jesus came to set the captives free\u201d"}, {"userName": "Krusher Basta", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3884711-krusher-basta", "userReview": "I can\u2019t remember where I heard about this book and what made me decide to try it, but somehow I missed that this was Christian Fiction. I am a Christian; a practicing Catholic. My family goes to church every Sunday, our children go to Catholic schools, and we enjoy being a part of our church community. But when I choose a book to read, particularly fiction, I am not looking religious message. To be honest, Terri Blackstock wasn\u2019t too overbearing in this regard, I just wasn\u2019t expecting it. The first half of the book was a little slow, but she had my interest in the last third of the book. However, overall I had an issue with the \u201cChristian\u201d theme. I don\u2019t want this review to be a spoiler so I will just say this. The issue I have with the message \u201cChristians\u201d try to get across, or at least how I hear it, is that if you pray God will swoop in and save the day (or in the case of TV Evangelists they will send God in to save the day after a sizable contribution has been made). In the book Barbara, the Mother, got in the way of the Atlanta Police, who were trying to find her daughter, and put her life, and her son\u2019s, in grave danger. But by praying everything worked out. In reality she would have made things far worse for her daughter and her son. I believe we were created by a Supreme Being, God. And that he gave us a free will. With that free will we humans make many mistakes and usually pay the consequences for those mistakes. Hopefully, we learn something. To me being a good Christian means that we try our best, acknowledge our failures, ask for forgiveness, and carry on. We do not jump into a viper pit and pray for God to protect us."}, {"userName": "Kav", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6025638-kav", "userReview": "Absolutely riveting. This author sure knows how to spin a suspenseful tale! I was completely captivated on page one. The subject matter is gritty and there are so many emotional punches -- at times I couldn't catch my breath. Page turning does not begin to describe how compelling a read Intervention is.  Barbara is a relatable heroine. She's been through so much -- especially where her daughter is concerned. And yet she clings to the Lord -- looks to Him for comfort and direction. When her daughter's drug addiction upends her world she struggles to take control....only to lose it completely in an unexpected and horrific way.  Suddenly her missing daughter goes from victim to suspect and Barbara doesn't trust the local police handling the case. She bulldozes through their investigation with assistance from her intrepid, computer savvy son. They drum up leads and chase them down as danger mounts and Barbara grows more desperate to save her child. I didn't put this book down until I reached the end...in the wee hours of the morning. This story is gut-wrenching and frightening as it mirrors reality. But Blackstock has also infused it with the joyous hope of Christ's saving grace. It's a story that is very close to the author's heart and that is evident in the rawness of the telling. Make sure to read the her note at the end."}, {"userName": "Agnes (BeaderBubbe)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3265140-agnes-beaderbubbe", "userReview": "Emily, who lost her father, pulls herself away from her mom and brother to live the life of an addict.

The police think she killed the counselor but her mom is set on finding the truth and does not believe her daughter is guilty.

While her mom could not help her when Emily was in the middle of the drug world; she pulled no stops to get to her daughter despite the police warnings to stay out of it.

I liked the character of Lance, he provided comic relief. I did not like the fact that every time the mother described her daughter to someone she would always call her pretty. I got tired of that description...I felt as if it was very shallow. Every mother would describe their daughter as pretty. I enjoyed the perspective of Emily, and hearing her tell what'd happened....but I didn't really like the killer/kidnapper's POV.
