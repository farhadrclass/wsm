One criticism is that while I found the sub-plot of the Trademart to be very interesting it seemed to just fade off without any explanation. Where did the Trader come from? How was he able to take a persons inner-most self...was it magic? Kira, Leader and Matty all seem to have magical powers...where did their powers come from. Their world seems to be ours...there are references to Shakespeare and periods of our history. But we have no magic, so where did it come from. I liked the allegorical aspect of people trading what is really important (their souls) in return for things like the removal of a birthmark, being taller, younger, less, bald, better looking, pretty furniture, a slot machine. It seems to speak to our own society where being beautiful is valued over kindness and intelligence (just watch an episode of Real Housewives of anywhere). Where people bankrupt themselves in pursuit of material goods they can't afford. All of the books in this series are allegories...The Giver showed what happens when people try to prevent any painful experience from ever happening to the people in its community...Gathering Blue showed a corrupt society where people had forgotten how to care for one another...and Messenger showed how a society that was based on caring principles could become corrupted. I look forward to reading Son, the final book in this series."}, {"userName": "Miranda Reads", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71848701-miranda-reads", "userReview": "This series should've stopped with the Giver.Mostly because: That. Ending. \nARE YOU KIDDING ME???\ndeeep breathsOkay, let me back up a bit. In this quasi-magic, quasi-dystopian world, we have humans with magical gifts living in harsh, cruel and primitive villages.In the previous book we followed Kira, who was gifted with great artistic skills with embroidery (talk about a disappointing super power!) as she is used and abused by those in power. This book, we follow Matt (Kira's old companion).\nThings seem more when you\u2019re little. They seem bigger, and distances seem farther.\nMatt - now Matty - is roughly a teenager and is coming into powers of his own. And (unsurprisingly) world has become very, very confusing for him. His deepest desire is to become the Messenger - in charge of relaying communication between the crude, vengeful and often irrational villages surround his little town. Only, some of their madness is infecting his home. \nAnd he could see as well that they had not yet approached the worst of it.\nA Trader has come to town and what he is trading causes harm to the entire population. Gentle friends are quickly becoming cruel, kind folks are becoming apathetic and soon the entire village shifts from idyllic to something far, far worse.In the midst of that, Matty is sent out with one, final task - to find Kira and bring her back before it's too late. But with her lame leg and the Forest's ever-increasingly menacing presence, Matty will soon find that even he might not make it back at all.Overall, I liked this one a bit more than the previous but I'm still peeved that after three books we're left with not even a scrap of information regarding their powers, the society (i.e. how the forest can have a consciousness) or the world-that-used-to-be.The Trader arc was never truly resolved and I don't think I could forgive the author for what she did to Matty. I'll finish this series but my heart isn't in it anymore.Audiobook CommentsWell-read and a pleasure to listen to. The variation in tone made this audiobook extremely engaging!"}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1999284-kimberly", "userReview": "This book was terrible. And stupid.It pains me to say so, because (as everyone likely knows by now) The Giver is one of my most favorite books of all time. In this book, we get to see Jonas again (and even Gabe, for a moment) so I thought for sure it would tie things together and give me some emotional resolution. And while it was good to see what happened to Jonas (even though he is never called by that name in this book, it's clearly Jonas) there were too many other major flaws for me to enjoy the story. Major spoilers ahead, so read at your own risk.First of all, I was more than a little confused to learn that Jonas literally arrived in Village (also, this trend of capitalizing nouns and not putting \"the\" in front of them--annoying as fuck) on a sled. The sled is now in Museum in Village. (SEE?! Annoying!) Because the ending of The Giver is so open ended, I kind of thought maybe the sled was a metaphor, or a hallucination, or something. Why was there randomly a sled? He literally rode a sled into town? All right. Okay. I'll pretend to buy that. BUT...Jonas is around 20-21 in this story. He has already been named the leader of this new community (his name is now Leader) and apparently has been for some time. Really? A thirteen-year-old shows up one day on a sled, with an infant, and in a few years he's the leader of the community? This is kind of explained by saying that Leader has a gift, the ability to \"see beyond.\" Yes, I've heard that before. Jonas could see colors when the other genetically engineered people in his childhood community could not. But wait--this is not the same \"seeing beyond\" that we know from before. Adult Jonas can actually see...beyond...what normal people can see. Like, he can stand in his study and focus really hard on the forest and \"see\" to the other side. But it makes him really tired. Hmmmm. When did he discover/master this particular skill? We never find out. At one point Matty, the main character in this story, is hanging out with Leader and admiring his many books. Leader says that they arrived one day (when he was about 15) on a river barge--just a bunch of wooden crates filled with books. We are led to understand that these were the books that the Giver had owned, sent down the river to Jonas as a token of forgiveness for leaving them and making them deal with memories and colors. So, what happened in his old community? Is the Giver still there? Did they sort themselves out? Again, we never find out. Jonas has never gone back to his old community, never regained contact with his family, nothing. No juicy tidbits for a Giver fan to hold on to.Apart from the frustrating lack of information about Jonas, we have a strange subplot involving trading pieces of your soul (or your family's health) for things like slot machines that give you candy. There's this shady fellow called Trademaster who is apparently magical in some way, because he's collecting \"the deepest self\" of many of the people in Village and trading them for these slot machines. This is making many of the people in Village turn into hostile assholes who are mean to each other, and want to close the borders to prevent additional refugees from coming in. So, you would think that this Trademaster fellow would be the Big Bad of the story. Who is he? What does he want? What on earth is he doing? Guess what? We see him once, and then...we. Never. Find. Out.Somehow related to this \"close the borders\" subplot is the fact that Forest (not THE forest, but proper noun Forest) is thickening, decaying, and killing people who try to enter it. Like, Forest is literally attacking people with vines and sharp sticks when they try to pass through. This obviously has something to do with why people in Village are becoming so mean, and also probably with Trademaster, but none of it is ever explained. Zip, zero, zilch, nothing. The book ends with Matty sacrificing himself by using up all of his healing power to \"heal\" the forest, which then heals the people in Village (by restoring their deepest selves) and Jonas and Kira (oh, she's here too) traipse out of the woods together. That's the end. The main character dies stopping this malevolent evil that is completely unexplained. Where was it coming from? Why is Forest trying to kill everyone? Are the slot machines evil? Who is Trademaster? What exactly were people trading? WHY IS THIS BOOK SO TERRIBLE?!We never find out.So, if you're looking for a completely nonsensical and frustrating read, I highly recommend this book. Otherwise, if you've read The Giver and are thinking about continuing the series, I strongly suggest that you do not, because you will be sorely disappointed.And yes, I'm still going to read Son. Glutton for punishment, I guess."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/634689-julie", "userReview": "Arrrrrgh! (In the best way...)I was 15 pages from the end and said to my husband, \"I don't see how this is going to end!\" So when I get to the end, I moaned, and he asked whether it was a bad ending, to which I replied, \"Really good--but bad.\"And that is all I can tell you. This is one you really must read if you have not. I think I might even read it again to really \"get\" it. If you can, start with The Giver and go right through to Gathering Blue and then Messenger. I have not enjoyed a related series of books so much since Goose Girl, Enna Burning, and River Secrets.

But overall?Eh. This one follows Matty as he lives his new life in Village. Several years have passed since Gathering Blue. He has lost his \"uneducated\" slang way of speaking and now talks totally \"normal.\" He pretty much has a completely different personality. He has been civilized. Not that it's a bad thing, but I definitely noticed a huge change. The plot of this very short book (less than 200 pages) is centered on Matty's life and his special ability. Also, some of the people in the Village are getting obsessed with this trading thing that goes on. What they trade is a mystery, but the smart people stay away from it. When people trade, they start to change.The traders end up wanting to close Village to new refugees, so Matty must go and bring Kira back before Village is closed for good. Matty must go through Forest, but Forest is also changing, and becoming a real danger to any humans traveling through it.SO.... this book has one of my biggest pet peeves in it. I won't say what it is because... spoilers. So that kind of influenced my feelings when the story ended. Also, the resolution just felt kind of unsatisfying.I really liked Matty and will still read the final one. But I think this was my least favorite so far. \nMinor spoilerish items below!\nI didn't get the Traders thing. That really wasn't explained at all. And really, the explanation for Forest was kind of weak, in my view. Did the guy named Trader who brought trading to Village have some ability or something? I felt there was potential there for a more exciting subplot, but it didn't go anywhere. Everything was wrapped up perfectly (well besides that ONE POO-POO THING HAPPENING) and rushed at the end.

This book is incredible. I confess to not loving Gathering Blue, but I think that was more because I was confused it wasn't directly about The Giver. But this quartet IS all tied together in knots. It's really awesome, and the cameos make me squee insanely. I wish I'd reread Gathering Blue before this one, though, because Messenger features...MATTY!! From Gathering Blue! SO YAY. And also. Oh. my. gosh. Jonas is in here. JONAS, LITTLE KIND AND WONDERFUL JONAS. Although he's all growed up. Gabe is briefly mentioned but he's not a huge part.The style is Lowry's trademark simplistically but beautiful flow of prose. I LURVE IT. It could be viewed as \"too simple\" but that's half the reason I like it. There's not excess. It's just the story. And that's blissful. It also features this creepy jumunji jungle. It was very nature-survival-ish, actually, which is quite different from the other books. But I LIKE. It's always fun when the foliage comes out to eat you.It's also really really short. Like less than 200-pages and yet WOW. It. hurt. me. badly. Just...wow. The ending. It has a worse cliffhanger than The Giver and I'm just A LITTLE BIT DISTRAUGHT RIGHT NOW, OKAY?!!

I liked this one better than the first, Gathering Blue. Actually, it had potential to be a great book, but it's like Lowry forgot her plot lines and things just fell off at the end of the book. The first two books, The Giver and Gathering Blue deal with utopian societies. This book takes place in a village with all the outcasts from these utopian societies. It's called the village of the Broken, people with some deformity, disfigurement or handicap that were ousted from their home village now live here. It is a great village where everyone accepts each other, has endless patience and are willing to help anyone along the way. Then these auctions called Trademart starts and it's simple at first, where people trade one good for another. But then people start trading part of their souls to fix their disfigurements. As the villagers become 'normal' their village changes. People mock others behind their backs, no one wants to help others anymore and now they want to close their village to any new outcasts, fearing the village will run out of supplies and resources. A messenger is sent out to all the surrounding places to let everyone know that the village of the Broken is builing a wall and closing itself down. This messenger has a secret too but will it help or hurt the village. And here's where the book falls off a little. The ending is a little anticlimactic, I was really interested in the Trademart aspect and then all of a sudden it wasn't mentioned anymore, it wasn't resolved. But I will say, for the age this book is written for, it is a good read and I think most tweens could get something valuable out of this book."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "[ Matty is a healer.

I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the two previous novels in this \"series,\" but it had such a powerful ending and the extreme geek in me was so excited that it united all three of the books together in such a good way... It's just hard for me.Matty didn't appeal to me as much as Jonas or Kira had in the previous novels, and while his struggles were interesting I felt it focused entirely too much on the journey through the forest while I was really wanting to know more about what was going on in Village as well as how exactly things were progressing in Kira's village that was featured in Gathering Blue (at the end of that it's in a pretty big mess, but we never get a real idea of HOW it changed or why).I felt this definitely could have used 50 more pages to flesh out different aspects of the story, and even then it still would have been pretty short! Seriously, I understand the basics of what was going on at Trade Mart, but I was still so curious as to what was going on that I wanted more information!Still, the ending was strong for me and I had a hard time sleeping after finishing it since I found myself thinking about it after I'd turned my light off. I can't really justify a 4-star rating on this even though it did keep me thinking, however. I liked it, but it just didn't resonate with me as much as the previous two.

Readers who were dissatisfied by the vague ending of The Giver will appreciate the glimpse of Gabe and Jonas' important role as Leader of Village. Matty, who befriended Kira in Gathering Blue, is the main character in Messenger. He is anticipating earning his true name, which he hopes will be Messenger. He knows all the paths of the mysterious forest, which becomes more and more sinister as the story progresses. Village, under Jonas' leadership, welcomes those who have escaped from other communities. However, the sinister influence of Trader is changing the people of Village. They decide to build a wall to stop immigrants from entering Village. Matty is sent into the forest with messages for the other communities and to bring Kira back before the wall goes up.

The author continues to build a very convincing fantasy world in which individuals with a variety of physical and/or emotional wounds as a consequence of life in a dystopian community are welcomed into Village, a place where they are valued and where their individual gifts are recognized and nurtured.As I expected from this author, the very strong undercurrent of spirituality is continued. This element is, in my opinion, slightly too melodramatic in the ending of this book; hence, I give it a slightly lower rating.

Matty, (Matt, in the previous book), is almost all grown up now, but beginning to discover something about himself that frightens him. Something that he doesn\u2019t understand\u2014something that could potentially effect great change in his world.Other than that, Messenger\u2019s plot follows an entirely different trajectory than that of its predecessors. In the previous two books things were bad, and things that seemed good were not really very good at all. There\u2019s a growing sense of unease\u2014a dull horror that things are not what they seem\u2014building up to a better ending. With Messenger, things start out just the way they should. Life is good in the Village. People share, and don\u2019t discriminate between others just because they\u2019re disabled in some way or another. From there, it gradually travels downhill. The mysterious Trade Mart has people trading away their inner selves and becoming selfish, and only receiving silly stuff in return, like velvet-covered furniture, an improved complexion, or an old slot machine that spits out candy. But what can be done about it? Trades are forever. That's where Matty comes in.Matty is like Jonas in a lot of ways. He\u2019s just beginning to grow up, and realize that there is more to the world than meets the eye. He\u2019s good-hearted, and willing to sacrifice himself for others if necessary. He\u2019s even beginning to experience the stirring of new power within himself, just like Jonas\u2014Jonas could \u201csee beyond,\u201d The Giver could \u201chear beyond,\u201d and Matty\u2014well, he can fix a frog.

The \"Messenger\" focuses on Matty, a character who briefly appeared in \"Gathering Blue\". We can see that everything is doing fine in the village he is currently living, but something ominous is approaching. Is not an unexplainable phenomenon or a fictional creature, but the society itself. The village who once was a humble and sympathetic place, is now becoming wretched, selfish, and uncaring... which is basically what is going on nowadays. The book teaches us bravery, courage, wisdom and the inner strength that unleashes during the darkest days.

The incredibly unique Forest, and what happens to it, and what it does, and also everything that happens in this entire book?? I CAN'T, I CAN'T, I CAN'T.So yeah, 5 stars. This quartet is growing on me. xD"}, {"userName": "Maurinejt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1220877-maurinejt", "userReview": "It's not that this book was bad per se. It is like the others in this series, beautifully written and deals with beloved characters. However, it would be a stretch to say I liked it. First, the plot elements are mystical which has never really happened before and I found totally out of place in the world. The series has toyed here and there with fantastic ideas, but they could be explained, if at a stretch. The Messenger is dealing with things like sentient forests and paranormal powers and it comes out of nowhere. Ultimately though, I didn't like this book because nothing was concluded. The final sacrifice was made yet the main problem is left unresolved. The thing is, you can't force salvation. To save someone, he or she needs to want to be saved and have some idea of what they're being saved from...or they'll go right back where they were. The solution in The Messenger is at best an extremely costly finger in the dike: the problem is still there, the cause of the problem is still there, and the water is still going to drown the populace. This is not a satisfactory end to a book. In fact, I felt I had wasted quite a lot of time reading a story that went nowhere."}, {"userName": "\u064a\u0627\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u062b\u0627\u0628\u062a", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015",

In it, in another lively and exciting story, Lowry continues to examine ideals and problems of socialism. She also brings in a heated immigration debate. I've really enjoyed the whole group of these books.However, the very end of this one made me mad. I don't know what I expected, and I probably wouldn't have minded it, actually, except that she chose to include some hints earlier in the book that make the end feel like pretty damn certain allegory.I never thought I'd say it, but Lois Lowry has let me down."}, {"userName": "Jinky", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013741-jinky", "userReview": "Reference: The Giver (book #1), Gathering Blue (book #2), Messenger (book #3)Let me begin to tell you that I had to re-align my thinking since book #2 because for some reason I had a wrong name in mind. I was quick to forget that the main character in book #1 was Jonas. For some reason when reading book #2 and saw the name Christopher, I pictured Jonas. So throughout book #2 and most of book #3 Christopher was Jonas to me. You can imagine how the story must have been different for me. I suppose knowing that now, I have two versions!! ~I think I need to take some Gingkoba 'cause I'm loosing it!!Okay, now for Messenger. Well, Matt in book #2 is now Matty and speaker in this book He is six years older from where book #2 left off. We find that he ends up living in Christopher's village. There he learned manners and proper grammar. He found place as courier of messages between villages and does so going through the Forest with ease. Then Matty's new village started to change as the Trade Market comes to bloom. The kind-hearted people basically traded their souls for vanity and trivial amusements. The people changed so much that they got tired of welcoming in the damaged and voted to close their doors to newcomers. This charge compelled Matty to go back to his old town to get Kira to her father before the the closing. At this point, the Forest was not kind as well. In fact, it seemed to live to torture and kill those in its path, even fierce Matty. That said, Matty and Kira's journey back to Christopher became hell-like. In the mean time, Leader (with powers to see beyond) kept Christopher updated in his children's (Christopher had considered Matty his son) travel. When Leader saw that Matty and Kira was at death's door, he went after them. Kira with powers to depict what's ahead through her threading saw that Leader was on his way to meet them. But Leader too was at death's door. It became apparent that it was time to use Matty's power though he felt it wouldn't do much considering his condition. Then, ... you'll have to read the rest!The whole trilogy was dark and dreary for most of it's story. It was painful to read but we find hope in the courage of it's amazing characters. We were reminded that a society can slowly and easily be corrupt. We are challenged to look around about us and know that individually we have power to help it to thrive well. We are all advocates to maintaining a civil society and securing that for our posterity. We are invited to discover and use our individual power for good. These are some of the things that I got out of these books."}, {"userName": "Peachy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095554-peachy", "userReview": "Messenger is the last in the trilogy that commenced with the ever popular The Giver, and which then was followed by Gathering Blue. Unfortunately the first two novels proved to be difficult acts to follow successfully, in my opinion. This story seemed somewhat contrived, haphazard and written with less creative flow. I was left with a lot of unanswered questions by the end, and felt slightly ripped off and let down. Ultimately I feel the story had the potential to be so much more. Ah, well, I would still recommend the series for children, as I do find there are a lot of morality issues addressed as well as an underlying meaningful social commentary.www.booksnakereviews.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7555122-laura", "userReview": "I was not impressed with this follow up book to The Giver and Gathering Blue. I felt no emotional ties to this book or the characters even though the characters were not new to the story. This totally missed the mark for me.

It was so nice to see how these books are beginning to thread together. I was wondering for a while if each book was more like a standalone experience versus an ongoing story, but now I know! Messenger is my favorite in this series so far. It enjoyed seeing familiar characters, and I felt more emotion while reading this one than I did the others. The dystopian world many authors in this genre create is no joke and this one is just as impressive. Maybe it doesn't have all the action/suspense that some of the more recent books do, but Messenger's impact is made elsewhere: The members of Messenger's society are naive and they do exactly what they are told, even when they shouldn't. It's an important reminder for the youth of today's world that although it is important to follow instructions and comply with rules/laws, it's also important to know when to advocate for change. We all have our own gifts for this purpose and I loved how Messenger incorporated this notion. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this series ends!My favorite quote:\u201cOur gifts are our weaponry.\u201dThe Giver Quartet includes the following installments:"}], "description": "Messenger is the masterful third novel in the Giver Quartet, which began with the dystopian bestseller The Giver, now a major motion picture.\u00a0Matty has lived in Village and flourished under the guidance of Seer, a blind man known for his special sight.
