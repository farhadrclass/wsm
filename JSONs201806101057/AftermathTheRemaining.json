All the mayhem and zombie apocalypse continues, with a serious dose of trouble from the redneck warlord faction to make it all that much more dramatic and ratchet up the stakes and the danger. This gets only two stars from me, though, because of two things: It seriously needed and editor, and it's just so rah-rah soldier and testosterone. First, the editor: There are so many places where words are spelled incorrectly or simply the wrong word is used that I lost count. Molles frequently writes \"bare\" when it should be \"bear,\" for example, \"staid\" instead of \"stayed,\" \"pale\" instead of \"pail,\" \"stare\" instead of \"stair,\" etc. Sure, these homophones will make it through a spell checker, but a spell check is completely different from a meaning check, and that's why a good writer needs a good editor.The plot also has some serious problems which an editor could have pointed out and given the author a chance to address. The biggest plot hole is Lee's side trip to Smithfield. It makes no sense that Lee would finally make it to his bunker, finally get a load of supplies for the people at Camp Ryder who are on the verge of starvation, and instead of going back there w/the supplies immediately would instead head off into the middle of an infected city on a completely different mission that might very well get him killed. No. I don't buy it. It's just dumb. If he's as smart and savvy as he's otherwise portrayed, he would have made sure the supplies got back to the people who needed them, and *then* gone on his mission. If he'd done that, Camp Ryder would have loved him and would have given him many more men and resources so he would have been much better able to accomplish the goal of checking on Maria's sister/looking for other survivors in Smithfield. And even if we believe he's going to go off on this fool's errand before he makes sure the supplies get to Camp Ryder, it goes completely against his mission not to at least take some steps to ensure that the supplies get there w/o him. He wouldn't take the supply truck and all of his little team into the infected area. That was just stupid. Sure, it ended up making for some good drama, but stupid. And the whole Doc subplot was also implausible. I can buy that this Doc guy was a spy for Milo and was trying to deliver Lee to Milo all in order to save his girlfriend, Nicole. Fine. But if that's what he was doing, then why, when Lee said he was not going back to Camp Ryder but was instead going into Smithfield, why would Doc say \"I'm going with you?\" How would that have helped Doc's plan to get Lee to Milo? Are we to believe Doc thought he might capture Lee and drag him to Milo somehow on his own? Again, makes no sense. Not plausible. So while it all comes together in the end, how we get there needed more thought, and a good editor would have helped encourage Molles to think about this plot a little more and smooth it out before it went to press. Finally, on the rah-rah: If Molles is not former military himself, he's done a great job on research because the details of the weapons and the gear and tactics and terminology of a special forces military operator seem very realistic and convincing. This is great, but it comes along with a sort of military boosterism that just bugs me. It could be worse, so it probably won't bother most readers. It's just not for me. The fact that I'm already reading the third installment in this series shows that I'm enjoying it and have become engaged enough with the characters and the situation that I want to find out what happens to them. That, alone, is no small achievement and reason enough to consider giving these books a read."}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9140603-derek", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of the post apocalyptic genre. I'm also a big fan of zombies. Not all zombie books are post apocalyptic, but this series seems to be what I would consider the best of both worlds.I really like the characters, and the pace of the books is excellent. Truly masterfully told.Dialogue is something that I tend to notice as being weak, or unnecessary filler in a lot of books. Certainly not this series. It seems very well done.The plot kept me interested the whole time. Always wondering what the next chapter had in store.And I dare say, as far as zombies go, this series does it better than anything I've seen so far. Zombies don't live on endlessly, crawling around with half a body. They're people. They lose enough blood, they die. It's so much more realistic than most of what you see out there.I love how the zombies (never actually referred to as zombies, which I like) function. I love how terrifying they are compared to anything else I've read. They truly are the most horrifying zombies I've ever seen, and I love it.I consider The Remaining series among my top 3 favorite reads of all time, right up there with WOOL and Ready Player One.I hope this series never ends. I'm very impressed by D.J. Molles incredible ability to create and tell a truly unique, captivating, and gripping story."}, {"userName": "Yara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18085531-yara", "userReview": "While this is not the best book in the world, I would recommend it for when you don't have the energy to think and need some brainless reading.

Let's start with what I enjoyed about this book: 1. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, never a dull moment. 2. The infected use objects as weapons to kill people. I've read a fair share of post-apocalpyse books and not once did an infected/zombie/whatever pick up a shovel to try and bash someones brains in. Now that's fucking scary. The two things that bugged me about this book were: 1. NOTHING ever went right. Seriously, not a damn thing. You couldn't so much as pick up a graham cracker crumb without having a horde of 500 crazies find you and tear you apart, and if you did end up getting away, you'd end up running into Milo and having him torture you to death (this didn't really happen, but you get what I'm saying). But I guess that's also what kept me so into the book, it was one crazy situation leading into an even crazier situation. 2. Some of the decisions that were made that were completely illogical ::this will contain a spoiler, heads up:: So Lee and a few of the guys from Camp Ryder get hold of a bunch of supplies (food, water, medical equipment, etc) from one of the bunkers and are about to bring them back to the camp. Keep in mind, Camp Ryder has completely used up all their food, so not getting these supplies back will be detrimental. But Lee made a promise that he would check to see if he could find any survivors, specifically the sister of one of the girls at Camp Ryder. So before going back to camp with all the supplies, they go on a possible suicide mission to the big city (filled with the infected) for the possibility of maybe finding this sister, risking everyones lives and the supplies that people are relying on. ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!!? Just take the supplies back FIRST then go another day for fucks sake. That was annoying. Ok even though I just wrote much more about what I didn't like about the book, I want to reiterate that I did enjoy this book. I just got frustrated with some of the characters. I highly recommend this for anyone who reads post-apocalyptic books."}, {"userName": "Brittany Kuehn", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7177905-brittany-kuehn", "userReview": "So I read this because I really liked the first of the series; I still enjoyed this book but it definitely went down hill. All the things I found somewhat annoying in the first book were much more ridiculous in the second. The book lacked direction and the main character made absurd choices! He was a really unbelievable, a hard core military man would not just decide to detour and look in on an infected city because someone was curious when 50 lives are depending on your current mission.. sorry, nope, make second trip and come back later. I am obviously going to continue to read these books, even though it looks like they are going down hill fast.. but hey, Ill do anything to avoid studying for finals."}, {"userName": "Timothy Mayer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2206481-timothy-mayer", "userReview": "The Remaining: Aftermath continues where the previous Aftermath novel ended. Capt.Lee Harden, US Army, has finally rendezvoused with a group of survivors. Known as \"Camp Ryder\", from the truck plant they occupy, they are few in number and led by an older man named Bus. But there is division in the ranks, notably from a faction allied with Jerry, who had been a successful businessman before The End Of The World As We Know It.While Harden is recuperating, there is a massive attack on the compound from the Infected. Using his tactical knowledge, Capt. Harden is able to repel the invaders and save the camp. But a young woman loses her life in the attack. Furthermore, an examination of the perimeter fence shows it had been cut. The Infected were lured to the breach with a CD player quietly reading from Moby Dick.As a newcomer, Harden is the source of suspicion. The only way he can regain the trust of the camp is to venture outside and find supplies. The novel revs into gear as Harden and a few volunteers go forth in search of food, medicine and whatever before the camp residents begin starving to death. The Infected are everywhere. As is the local meth-head warlord, Milo. And Milo may have a traitor on the inside of Camp Ryder.As in the first novel, The Remaining: Aftermath is one action scene after another. Capt. Harden is either rescuing people or trying to escape from a trap. The feel of the book is relentless again: you can't catch your breath in one scene because another attack is imminent. And, like the previous novel, there is plenty of technical detail about military hardware.There's some new characters. Notably, Father Jim, a gun-toting priest who takes care of the remains of his flock. Father Jim looks on Capt. Harden as some sort of divine avenger. He's an interesting character and I hope we'll see more of him as the series progresses.Amongst all the explosions and bullets flying can be found this bit of insight:\"This is a concept drilled into any soldier, from day one as a recruit. It is reinforced mentally and physically, officially and unofficially, through indoctrination and through the military subculture. Nothing you do as a recruit is right, even if you\u2019re right. The instructors are always striving to achieve the sensation of failure, because it is imminent and inevitable that every soldier, every warrior will someday find themselves in a position where even their best efforts were not enough, and the greatest plan in the world still didn\u2019t work out. That failure can bring out two things in a man: forfeit or fight. A normal man forfeits, where a warrior fights.\"And the Infected are starting to evolve. toward the beginning of the book, Harden is nearly trapped by a group of Infected working together. The Infected are starting to exhibit pack animal characteristics.This is an intense series and I'm curious to see where the author will be taking it."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4454804-john", "userReview": "This series remains very solid with the second installment -- it's a roller-coaster ride with a very credible storyline and not much unnecessary fat to go with it. The characters are engaging, and the overall tone makes for a very compelling story.With the popularity of The Walking Dead TV series, I find myself wondering why someone such as HBO or TNT or SyFy hasn't looked into picking up this series for TV. It plays on the same zombie themes that make The Walking Dead so popular, and the characters are easily as engaging as those in The Walking Dead, but the premise and storyline is more purposeful, lending itself to have more of a post-apocalyptic/societal collapse/rebuilding themes, somewhat along the lines of other shows like Revolution, Under The Dome, or Jericho. As with the first book, there is some clunky editing in a couple of spots but nothing too egregious -- just a few obvious examples of where automatic spell checking was relied upon more than an actual copy editor or alpha readers with an editorial eye.All in all, one of the most engaging series I've read in quite some time."}, {"userName": "Pablo Padilla", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7610134-pablo-padilla", "userReview": "From start to finish, this book is such a fun and action packed, well written, amazing-imagery, great descriptions book.

D J Molle\u2019s \u2018The Remaining\u2019 started a new series of books that followed trained military expert Captain Lee Harden and his mission to rebuild America should the undead hit the fan. As an introduction, \u2018The Remaining\u2019 did a great job in creating the world and exploring Harden\u2019s tenacity to stick to the mission, but it ended so abruptly. \u2018The Remaining: The Aftermath\u2019 picks up moments later and continues the tale, but does it still deliver a week into his mission?If Harden is not being chased by virus infected crazies, he is being shot at by unfriendly humans. Either way, it appears he is always out of luck, until \u2018The Aftermath\u2019. Harden has now found a stable community that he can build upon to realise his mission of restoring the ideas behind what makes America great. With limited resources, Harden and some of the other survivors set out to find a hidden military bunker full of supplies. All that is in the way is an army of the undead and a few military nutcases \u2013 easy.\u2018The Aftermath\u2019 continues in the tone and style of \u2018The Remaining\u2019 in both a positive and negative way. The pace remains high and the action even seems to hot up in book two as the mindless threat of the undead begins to evolve. This is coupled with a larger and more threatening human presence. Not only must Harden combat the violent groups outside of his own, but factions from within that plan to use old-fashioned politics to usurp power.Where the series falls down once more is in the episodic style. To say that \u2018The Remaining\u2019 owes a lot to \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 is an understatement \u2013 they are two similar worlds that are built on similar character and episodic development. Where \u2018The Aftermath\u2019 is able to improve on \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 is the fact that the undead are not actually zombies, but infected. This opens up far more potential for Molles to explore his creations as they begin to think in a pack mentality that alters the way the humans must survive.There is a larger universe to \u2018The Remaining\u2019 books that is very interesting, but feels just out of reach. Molles is more interested in telling a snapshot of the story and filling it with action, a reader will have to go through the entire set to get a better understanding of how the world of \u2018The Remaining\u2019 came to be. Thankfully, if the action remains as entertaining as in \u2018The Aftermath\u2019 this will not be problem as getting the overview will be a joy. Some of the sequences are electric \u2013 a struggle for petrol on a quiet road, or the hospital stand-off. I also liked the introduction of a human threat and the way that Molles concludes this book in a way you may not suspect.All of Molles\u2019 \u2018The Remaining\u2019 books should be read in order if you can as although each is a great action science fiction horror, the main series narrative does add to the fun. At times \u2018The Aftermath\u2019 just feels like an empty-headed action book, but knowing that it is part of a larger vision really fleshes it out."}, {"userName": "Saturnfx", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13830689-saturnfx", "userReview": "in the zombie and infected genre of books, you have many styles, from comical, gore, horror, serious, etc.This is most certainly falling in the serious drama type genre. It is sad, it is at times hopeless, and it is very well written for its category.Is the story good? Yes, its good. Perhaps for some its a bit too \"real\". No storybook fantasies of being king of zombieland or having a curiously fun time in the survival of it all. It is just oppressive and has a feel of almost being in a wartorn country...which in all likelihood is the reality of the situation.The more unrealistic aspects of this narrative is the iron will of the protagonist and his seemingly endless selfless quest to try and bring some order to the chaos. I know most people would simply say f-it all and go hide in the luxury bunkers with a few close friends for a few years until society sorts itself out one way or another. Not to say everyone reacts like that, but most would, which in a way sort of makes the character a bit less connectable to the reader. Not to say it is a poorly written character, Lee is quite well developed, but it seems he lacks the certain selfishness that humanity has in general...and frankly, sometimes the reader is rooting for him to go a bit selfish now and then...take a vacation, relax, and let stuff sort itself out for a bit while he at least heals up.I highly recommend this whole series of books, with an warning though...be prepared to be huffing a lot. Murphys law is very much in effect here and will make you wonder why at times he simply doesn't just leave or put a bullet in his head..both being justifiable under the endless array of circumstances.The infected: Not zombies...actually gives you the chills at times because it is based more on just a nasty virus making most people primal verses the shuffling undead.Think cannibalistic pack wolves mentality with some shreds of their former self still there verses the shuffling dead. This adds first off a bit of realism, but more importantly, a moral dilemma considering they aren't so far gone that they have simply lost their entire self...I mean, sure, their primary concern is to murder you and eat you (and everything else that isn't one of their own), but there is still something there...in book 1, there is a part where a infected is even scratching out on the ground the word help...which makes the whole concept horrific (imagine being trapped inside a primal brain but not strong enough to get past it).This sadly hasn't truly been addressed yet to its fullest potential(currently reading book 4), but the scope is terrible, but also adds a slight veil of hope that a cure could happen (not the focus of the book. the focus of the book is try to live till tomorrow).Complex, well written, good arcs, no supermen but plenty of bravery, and believable reactions (mostly). Definitely one of the better narratives.But seriously...Lee needs a week off."}, {"userName": "Kristin Taggart", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16051353-kristin-taggart", "userReview": "I don't use star ratings, so please read my review!(Description nicked from B&N.com.)\u201cTo Captain Lee Harden, Project Hometown feels like a distant dream and the completion of his mission seems unattainable. Wounded and weaponless, he has stumbled upon a group of survivors that seems willing to help. But a tragedy in the group causes a deep rift to come to light and forces him into action. In the chaos of the world outside, Lee is pursued by a new threat: someone who will stop at nothing to get what he has.\u201dI almost didn\u2019t pick this book up after reading The Remaining and seeing what seemed to me to be its rather huge logistical plot holes. The story was pretty good, despite the fact that I occasionally wanted to shake the author by the shoulders and ask what the heck he was thinking. With that in mind, I took the plunge and grabbed this one. Bear in mind that this book is only available in e-book format right now, with the print version not due until late June.Molles has found his stride in this second book. By putting Harden into a larger and more settled group of people, the author allows him to go from running around aimlessly to actually planning and acting with forethought. It\u2019s a different kind of adventure from the first book, where our hero was bouncing all over the place willy-nilly. This is the point where Hardin really begins to carry out his mission, which suits his character much better. He does have some natural leadership qualities, and having him roaming around the countryside by himself doesn\u2019t work as well.Also in this book, we get a more concrete antagonist than just the mindless shells of humanity. As with many stories, readers are shown that humans don\u2019t need a rampaging virus to act like savages\u2014we\u2019re perfectly capable of doing that all on our own. While it\u2019s certainly scary to think of zombie-ish creatures wandering around looking for something to attack, I find it creepier to realize that some people would do so carefully, with calm consideration, just because they could. And Molles does an excellent job at portraying people whom you wouldn\u2019t want to meet in a dystopian setting of any kind.With all of this, the novel feels much more cohesive than the first one, and it also feels more solid. Although the characters are running around the countryside just as much, there\u2019s more of a goal this time around, and this makes the focus of the story work much better.I liked this book much more than the original novel, and I\u2019ll be picking up the next ones in the near future.

Especially when he found himself in some impossible situations. Let me tell you, more than once I was hanging off the edge of my seat, biting my nails, hoping, praying that Lee would make it out alive and not get infected. One part really frustrated me to no end. I literally screamed at the book, asking WHAT JUST HAPPENED! I didn't see that part coming at all, and once again, I thought, nope, there's just no way things will ever work out for Lee. Now these infected have gotten \"better\" at what they do in this one. They're adapting in such a way that NO ONE expected and it's terrifying to read how different the infected are now compared to book 1. I didn't expect that either and it really made the book better in my opinion. It would get boring if nothing ever happened! In this one, Lee does have a lot more going on and trying so hard to do what he was trained to do.

Not traditional zombies, more the \"infected\" type, but I like both so fine by me. No mushy viewpoint of feeling sorry for the infected or romanticizing them, just thrilling roller coaster action and great characters. You will enjoy this whether you are military or not - but if you ARE military or gun savvy this series with not hack you off. Molles did some research - thank goodness - and for once nothing irritated me. Also, the female characters were well written. (one of my pet peeves) They were a variety of women, as we actually are, from sarcastic bad asses to whinier helpless types and everything in between. They were very individual and seemed well thought out - allowed to grow and change and be full characters. Often in this genre the women characters irritate the crap out of me. They are usually written as mommy/wives or whores and barely even exist in the story except to be rescued, slept with, scream \"somebody save my chillllldren\", or munched on.

I could have done with fewer hordes of Infected. I find it hard to understand how so many could survive for so many weeks. As top predators they wold run out of food, poor access to water would have lead to a lot of death by dehydration, and they should be succumbing to disease and infection at a high rate. The smaller packs that roam the countryside are more believable, but I can't accept the premise that hordes of infected with hundreds of members would be able to survive for weeks with so little prey. Surely they would starve en mass and be succumbing to disease and not be increasing in numbers.

Am starting the next one, immediately."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28083077-cindy", "userReview": "Good continuation of the first book. Lots of zombies, lots of action. Sometimes it almost seems like too much conflict. Lee's injuries seemed to me like they would have prevented him from doing much of what he did so that didn't seem to fit."}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2142019-steph", "userReview": "Listened to audiobook with hubby.
