Most people who review the book seem to love it. They talk about how riveting and suspenseful the book is and how they felt compelled to finish it in a single reading. I guess I\u2019ll have to be one of the few dissenting voices. I really, really, really disliked Room and yes, I do have specific reasons why.I can\u2019t imagine anyone not knowing the basic plot of Room, but for those who don\u2019t, the book was inspired by the true story of Elisabeth Fritzl, an Austrian woman who had been imprisoned in her father\u2019s basement for twenty-four years, during which time he repeatedly assaulted and raped her. She eventually bore him seven children and had one miscarriage. Three of her children, one daughter and two sons had been imprisoned with their mother for the whole of their lives (until rescue).Room takes its basic plot from the Fritzl case as well as the cases of Jaycee Lee Dugard in California and of Natascha Kampusch and Sabine Dardenne.Room is narrated by a young boy, Jack, who has just \u201ccelebrated\u201d his fifth birthday. Jack has never known a human being other than his mother, who he calls \u201cMa.\u201d \u201cMa,\u201d we come to learn, was abducted one night at age nineteen on her way to the school library. For the past seven years she\u2019s been held captive in a garden shed fitted with soundproofed cork, lead-lined walls, and a coded metal security door and raped repeatedly by her captor, a man she calls \u201cOld Nick.\u201d Two years into her abduction, \u201cMa\u201d gave birth to a son, the five-year-old Jack mentioned above.We soon learn that \u201cMa\u201d has tried to make life as normal and as sane as possible for Jack as one can in a room that measures 11x11. She holds \u201cPhys Ed\u201d classes for Jack in the morning and tries to ensure that he gets some exercise. She insists that they keep to strict mealtimes. They do have a TV, and though \u201cMa\u201d limits Jack\u2019s TV watching just like any good parent would do, it is from TV that Jack learns about the outside world, that he learns the stories that \u201cMa\u201d entertains him with are true ones. However, despite the fact that Jack has access to television, he really isn\u2019t aware that anything exists outside of \u201cRoom.\u201d Even \u201cOld Nick\u201d isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d to Jack because Jack\u2019s always safe in \u201cWardrobe\u201d when \u201cOld Nick\u201d comes through \u201cDoor.\u201d All Jack really knows about \u201cOld Nick\u201d is that he \u201cbrings groceries and Sundaytreat and disappears the trash, but he's not human like us. He only happens in the night, like bats.... I think Ma doesn't like to talk about him in case he gets realer.\u201dI have to admit, I\u2019ve never been fond of books narrated by children, but Room, for me, was especially odious. \u201cMa\u201d has created characters out of all the objects in \u201cRoom\u201d and Jack refers to them as though they are real, living, breathing persons. There\u2019s \u201cWardrobe\u201d and \u201cRug\u201d and \u201cPlant\u201d and \u201cMeltedy Spoon.\u201d One page of this is bad enough, but an entire book? It took a lot of determination for me to finish the thing. Here\u2019s Jack describing a typical day in \u201cRoom\u201d:We have thousands of things to do every morning, like give Plant a cup of water in Sink for no spilling, then put her back on her saucer on Dresser.... I count one hundred cereal and waterfall the milk that\u2019s nearly the same white as the bowls, no splashing, we thank Baby Jesus.Waterfall the milk??????Regarding his TV watching, Jack says:I'd love to watch TV all the time, but it rots our brains. Before I came down from Heaven Ma left it on all day long and got turned into a zombie that's like a ghost but walks thump thump. So now she always switches off after one show, then the cells multiply again in the day and we can watch another show after dinner and grow more brains in our sleep.And here\u2019s Jack talking about some \u201cquiet time\u201d with \u201cMa\u201d:I get on Ma\u2019s lap in Rocker with our legs all jumbled up. She\u2019s the wizard transformed into a giant squid and I\u2019m prince JackerJack and I escape in the end. We do tickles and Bouncy Bouncy and jaggedy shadows on Bed Wall.Well, a paragraph of that here and there might have worked, but a whole half of a book? Not on your life. And this is a kid who can sing along to Eminem and Woody Guthrie music videos. He knows the latest dances. He listens to people speak on TV. His own mother, the only person with whom he converses, speaks normally. He uses words like \u201crappelling\u201d and \u201chippopotami\u201d with ease. Heck, he even knows more about the fall of the Berlin Wall than many Germans. So what\u2019s with the almost unintelligible baby talk? I know he\u2019s only five, but other than his horrendous speech, he seems to be a very precocious five. And please. How many rundowns of \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d or \u201cSpongebob Squarepants\u201d can one reader take without wanting to throw the book across the room?(From here on this review will contain minor plot spoilers. Please don\u2019t continue reading if plot spoilers will ruin the book for you.)The story of Room is split into two parts, the first part occurring in \u201cRoom\u201d and the second part occurring \u201cOutside\u201d after \u201cMa\u201d and Jack escape. The escape is, to put it mildly, totally ludicrous. For a kid who doesn\u2019t even believe the outside world exists, to do what Jack did is beyond belief. It\u2019s like Donoghue didn\u2019t know what she wanted her book to be \u2013 the claustrophobic story of captivity inside a small room and how it limits the emotional and intellectual growth of a five-year-old or how a five-year-old who\u2019s been imprisoned in an 11x11 room all his life can mature and be a hero. None of us, including Donoghue, can have it both ways.Once we realize that Jack and \u201cMa\u201d (we never do learn her name) are being held captive, one would think that Room would take on a sinister, suspenseful atmosphere and leave us wondering what \u201cOld Nick\u201d is going to do next. Instead, it\u2019s painfully boring and slow going and almost totally lacking in suspense. Because Donoghue confines her point of view, at least in the first half of the book, to Jack, the insight we get is painfully mundane, and well, boring. When we finally reach the unbelievable \u201cescape\u201d from \u201cRoom,\u201d it all feels forced and shallow and contrived.Some people have made the remark that Donoghue captures perfectly the voice of a young child. I don\u2019t think she does. I don\u2019t even think she captures perfectly the voice of a young child who\u2019s been imprisoned and cut off from the world for all of his five years of life. However, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s just say that Donoghue does capture a five-year-old\u2019s speech pattern perfectly. How many books written by five-year-olds do you find engrossing and enlightening? My bet is none. Five-year-olds can be cute in small doses and of course we love them and want the best for them, but let\u2019s be truthful, they really aren\u2019t very insightful or interesting for long periods of time, and neither is Jack.And then, after the totally implausible \u201cescape\u201d from \u201cRoom,\u201d Donoghue fails to explore, with deep insight, the ramifications of reentering a world from which one\u2019s been absent for seven years, or in Jack\u2019s case, a world he\u2019s never known. I felt Donoghue glossed over this difficult transition. I felt the second half of the book lacked depth just as the first half did, though in a different way. What does \u201cMa\u201d feel now that she\u2019s free? Is she going to reunite with her own parents? (Her mother refused to accept \u201cMa\u2019s\u201d seeming death, while her father needed to do so and even held a funeral for her.) Is she going to introduce them to their grandson and him to them? Being held in captivity for years, then introduced/reintroduced to the outside world is going to be traumatic for anyone, but for some mysterious reason, Donoghue doesn\u2019t want to explore the rich store of human emotions she could have mined. There was a curious disconnect between the intense trauma \u201cMa\u201d and Jack would have had to suffer and the blitheness with which Donoghue relates their story.And what of the unnatural bond, truly reminiscent of that in \u201cPsycho,\u201d formed between Jack and \u201cMa\u201d while in \u201cRoom?\u201d Yes, I realize that two people imprisoned together for years are going to form a deep bond, but once those people are freed, especially if they are a twenty-six year old mother and her five-year-old son, then some separation and setting of boundaries is going to be necessary in order to promote mental and emotional health. But Donoghue never explores this facet of \u201cMa\u2019s\u201d and Jack\u2019s captivity, though clearly, she realized it exists. At one point, Jack says of himself, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a human, but I\u2019m a me-and-Ma as well.\u201d That outlook might have served him well in \u201cRoom\u201d but it\u2019s a dangerous one to cultivate in \u201cOutside.\u201dDonoghue took a real risk with Room and I applaud her for her courage. I think this is going to be a very polarizing book \u2013 people will probably either love it or hate it. They will feel it worked wonderfully or they will feel it didn\u2019t work at all. Obviously, for me, it didn\u2019t work at all. I thought the premise was wonderful, but I felt Donoghue failed to deliver. I honestly can\u2019t understand how this book even made the Booker longlist, let alone the shortlist. I expect more depth and insight from a Booker nominated work. Do I think Donoghue was a lazy storyteller with Room? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go that far, but I do think she capitalized on gimmicks and topicality, and I was very disappointed. In the end, the whole thing felt like a cheap trick to me, and after reading it, I felt like I had to go take a long, hot shower.1/5Recommended: No."}, {"userName": "j", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-j", "userReview": "I was all ready to hate this book. Doesn't it sound obnoxious? An adult novel about harrowing things, but narrated by a 5-year-old? Mere gimmickry, right, a showy writing experiment, likely to win praise from the easily impressed.But I don't think I am that easily impressed, and damn, this book is kind of a stunner. Because yes, if not handled exactly right, a book narrated by a child probably would be obnoxious. I haven't read Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close yet, and I might or might not like it, but I already know that it is written in the voice of a precocious 9-year-old, and precocious kids usually are pretty annoying. But Jack, the narrator of Room, is not really precocious, and Emma Donoghue has managed to capture a realistic child's voice without turning out a book that's overly simplistic or too calculated. And I really don't know how she did it. As you begin reading this story of a boy who has spent his entire life locked in one small room, the son of the unfortunate Ma (who is never named, because she's Ma), who was kidnapped and has been kept in the room for the last seven years, it does seem too cute: all the objects in Room are proper nouns with genders, like Floor and Bed and Duvet and Wardrobe, which kind of makes sense because to Jack, they are the only onlys of those things in the world, because the whole world is Room (he has a TV, which he thinks shows make-believe things that live on planets inside the TV). But I kept reading, and there's really remarkable depth to the story even though such a limited narrative scope. What really grabbed me is the way the book perfectly captures the malleability of a kid's mind, the way they take what they know and use it as a filter to interpret the stuff they encounter that they don't understand. I once read something by Stephen King that posited that all children are more or less clinically insane until about age seven, when those parts of their brain firm up and they stop coming up with ideas like, \"oh it got dark because a giant monster ate the sun.\" And of course, Emma Donoghue knows that we are not 5-year-olds, and she somehow manages to weave in all these staggeringly sad truths about the world, and growing up, and our relationships with our parents, and how fleeting time and relationships can be, all into the voice of this little boy who doesn't even realize what he's saying, but it doesn't feel crammed in, or like a cheat (the Magical Negro 5-Year-Old).I didn't say anything about the plot because I think it really helps to not know much beyond the premise going in (and it's one of those books I would really like to have read knowing absolutely nothing at all, but such is life). And yes, it's more of a heart book than a head book, but I don't think it is bad that sometimes books try to engage us in different ways. And certainly there's room, with this premise, for a different kind of book, almost a social satire, but that's not what we have here, and it's still quite an experience."}, {"userName": "Jesse (JesseTheReader)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114361-jesse-jessethereader", "userReview": "Such a gripping and emotional read!

clearly he knows that i am a \"reader\". but just as clearly he does not get that i like my books to have at least an edge of un-reality to them. you know, fantasy. horror. science fiction. historical fiction. and if not that, then just something, anything that moves them away from mainstream depictions of the modern real world. now Room looks like a snapshot of life right from the news. or right from my place of work! good grief, i deal with depressing enough stuff already goddamnit! reading the back cover description was like reading the label of a bottle of poison - i do not want to drink this. but fine, i respect you Michael and so i will read this one. just don't get mad if it takes me two months to get through this fucking thing. __________it took me over two weeks to finish the first half. i finished the second half during an afternoon and part of an evening. an amazing novel and a very emotional experience. i think i'll save writing a review for a little bit and let it sink in for a while.__________it's hard for me to define exactly why the first half of the novel was so hard to get through. at first i convinced myself that the child's perspective was just too \"hearbreakingly poignant\", and i am not the kind of person who is enthusiastic about reading works of heartbreaking poignance. but that is patently false; i love those kinds of books although i would never admit it openly. well, i'd say it in a GR review, but i would never say that out loud, if that makes sense. perhaps i'm a hypocrite that way. so then i convinced myself that there was just something wrong with the narrator's voice, something off, he just seemed - at different points - to be either too precocious or too simple for a child his age. i compared him a lot to my nephews, and it didn't gel - his thought process did not parallel their thought process. but then i thought about this kid's situation, the extreme sort of home-schooling he received, the protective wall that his amazing mom built for him, the way he interpreted the world...and it made sense, a whole lot of sense. his voice turned out to be a very real one for me, at least based upon my understanding of his young life.and so i realized that the reason i was avoiding coming back to Room's first half was more basic, more simple. it made me want to cry, all the time. perhaps i'm too soft, maybe i just have too thin a skin. it's not like i have any illusions about kids - they are not saints to me, nor are they just tiny adults. i'm comfortable around children and i prefer them to many adults i've met, but i don't idealize them either. however i do have a big natural urge to protect them. i'm not sure where that comes from; i don't think it's based on genetics or upbringing. and so it was just really hard to return again and again to a novel that had as its central situation the kind of thing that i try actively to never contemplate. as in, i'll turn the channel or put down the paper if i come across a story like this one. to be honest, each time i read a few lines of the first half, my eyes would well up a little, that shortness of breath thing happened - and often in public, on the bus, at a coffeeshop, reading at a lunch spot. the private world of this novel became a public experience to me. i avoided this book at first because i do not like to appear weak - to the world around me, or to myself.i told the guy who loaned me the book about my issues and was given some advice: just stick with it, it will open up and it will be beautiful. and so i did. and the book did. it was good advice.the first half of the book was beautiful as well. wonderfully written. but thank God, the second half really did open up. it was like taking a breath of wonderful, clean air, somewhere in nature, away from the city. the humor remained but it was transformed into something wry, something that was still poignant but with a sheen of sardonic humor that i appreciated (and, truth be told, perhaps had a level of distance to it that i rather lazily connected to as well). the anger i felt in the first half towards Old Nick was inchoate - the kind of blind rage that i feel towards anyone who'd harm a child. the anger i felt in the second half was of a kind that is more comfortable, more familiar - towards the media, towards pop psychology, towards various institutions and the like. the second half had lessons to be learned - lessons about perception and isolation and materialism and the family bond and the bond between mother & son, protector & protected. the simple fact of \"lessons to be learned\" made the second half so much easier to read, it made the narrative positively propulsive in my desire to learn what was going to happen next. the horribly (and needfully) static nature of the book's first half was replaced by an emotional dynamism that really grabbed me. again, this is not a critique of the first half, which i think was perfectly written. instead, it is a critique of my own ability to deal with challenging, terrifying situations involving kids - since i couldn't do anything to stop or even hurt Old Nick, i wanted only to look away. and so the second half turned out to be more of a familiar road, with familiar pleasures. the first half of the book was horribly unique and my mind balked. the second half eased me back into a world i could deal with, respond to, and not shut down. at the end of the second half, the end of the novel itself, i read those last few sentences over and again, closed the book, and cried. such a relief. it's funny to think of all the tears i had saved up."}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "This book was awful. Emotionless. Annoying.Look, I get it, it's quite difficult to write from the perspective of a 5-year old as a grown up. I can hardly remember what it was like being five, and I can't even begin to write from the POV of one. I do, however, know an enjoyable story when I see it, and I know when I'm annoyed. And I know that this book annoyed me greatly.The hallmark of any brilliant novel is the ability to make the reader empathize for the characters in the book. I want to be able to understand and experience the joy, suffering, frustration, anger, whatever it is that the main characters and the main narrators feel. I got none of that here, due in part to the emotional immaturity and lack of comprehension on the very young main characters' part, and in part due to my frustration and annoyance at the five year old narrator.The little boy's is haphazard, almost a stream of consciousness narration.\nI choose Meltedy Spoon with the white all blobby on his handle when he leaned on the pan of boiling pasta by accident. Ma doesn\u2019t like Meltedy Spoon but he\u2019s my favorite because he\u2019s not the same.\nAnd I have to tell you, it is annoying as fuck. In that sense, maybe the book is fairly true to the depiction of kids, because to be honest, a lot of kids are pretty damn annoying to me.Maybe this kid is annoying because he doesn't know anything outside Room. Maybe he's immature because of his seclusion. Maybe this. Maybe that. I don't want to have to make excuses for the book's shortcomings.This book takes place in a room. Have you ever been locked up for an entire day in a room (without a computer or an iPhone for company?) It is as boring as it sounds, and this book is as boring as it sounds. But it's not boring because the mom has the kid and they love each other! That makes it awesome, right? Not for me. I have a little sister. She's 10 years younger than I am. Consequently, I had to put up with a hell of a lot of little kids growing up. They were intelligent, bright, precocious. I still couldn't stand their company. This book was hell.The story of Ma is pretty awful, because she's been kidnapped and raped and locked up. We got no sense of that. There is no emotion, there is no horror, there is no knowing what happened to her because the story is told from the perspective of a stupid little child. The choice of the narrator completely ruins what should have been a heart-wrenching tale."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "Healthy ambition is a laudable trait and I admire people willing to reach beyond their grasp in the attempt to achieve something special. \nI respect the author\u2019s choice to write a dark-themed story narrated entirely from the perspective of a five year old boy. While the unreliable narrator is nothing new in literature, its deployment here felt fresh and so I give points for that. Unfortunately, that is about all I can give points for because the novel itself was a huge miss for me. Huge!! Obviously, the story is intended to be an emotional ordeal with its depiction of a young woman and her 5 year old son being held captive in a garden shack (the eponymous \u201cRoom\u201d) by a sociopath named \u201cOld Nick.\u201d At the beginning of the story, the woman, who was 19 when she was abducted, has been in the Room for almost 10 years. Her son, Jack, just turned 5...you can do the math regarding Jack\u2019s paternity. Neither of them has been outside the Room in all that time. This is dark stuff. This is uncomfortable stuff. This is a story about a horrible person doing horrible things. It should have punched me in the core and twisted me up in knots. Yet it never affected me. Now, if I was a cold, empathy-impaired individual, I might chalk up my lack of reaction to a simple case of \u201cnot my kind of story\u201d and leave it at that. However, if you\u2019ve read any of my reviews, you should have clued into the fact that I\u2019m a deeply  some would say overly  emotional reader. Books move me, that\u2019s why I read them. They make me laugh, cry, rage, exult\u2026they make me feel. Yet, despite the highly charged subject matter of the story, no more than an occasional trickle of emotion ever filtered through to me from the page. Something was serious amiss in the delivery. Given my blas\u00e9 reaction to the story, I began to suspect that the use of a child narrator was nothing more than a huge gimmick designed to help distinguish a story that otherwise had very little to recommend it. I know that's not the consensus opinion, but it's honestly how I felt. To be fair, it\u2019s more likely that the use of Jack as the narrator, while an interesting plot device, simply presented too many serious challenges that the novel, unfortunately, was unable to successfully overcome. To the good, the author does a nice job of showing us the world of Room through the lens of Jack\u2019s childhood perception. We learn how Jack has named and anthropomorphized every object in the room and thinks of them as his friends, and how he refers to each channel on the TV as a different planet. Initially, this is kind of cute, but it got old and decrepit in short order. The real problem for me was that Jack was too detached from the horror of his situation and it care-blocked the impact of the story on the reader\u2026at least this reader. Children Jack\u2019s age, while certainly able to show empathy, are generally so egocentric that any feelings of compassion for another\u2019s pain are weak and undeveloped, being more about parroting behavior they\u2019ve learned from caregivers than a true placing of themselves \u201cin the shoes\u201d of the other person. Unfortunately, this worked against my connection with the narrative. Jack\u2019s happy-go-lucky outlook was too strong a filter between what I could tell was happening in the story and what I knew I was supposed to be feeling about it. Jack\u2019s personal, subjective experience of his captivity is completely lacking in any sense of sadness or dread. This is because his mother does a wonderful job of sheltering him from the reality of their situation. However, Jack also doesn\u2019t experience feelings of discomfort about the abuse that his mother is subjected to and this subtracts a great deal from the power of these scenes. Without his own internal sense of bewilderment, confinement or pain, much of the intended poignancy was lost on me. I knew I was supposed to feel something, but I didn't. That\u2019s just me. If I had found the emotional tether that could have pulled me into the Room with Jack and his mother, my feelings for the book would have been much different. The writing is fine and the author\u2019s ability to convincingly give voice to Jack was worthy of note. I just never found the necessary connection and that is a shame. I envy those of you that loved this as I was really looking forward to reading it. 2.0 stars."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "[\"In the world I notice persons are nearly always stressed and have no time,\" for example, shows up towards the end.

Jack and his Ma share Room. He thinks of every object in Room like Rug or Plant or Meltdy Spoon as a friend to be treasured, and he and Ma spend every day doing their chores and playing games like Scream where they yell as loudly as they can. Jack loves his Ma and Room, but he\u2019s scared of Old Nick who comes some nights and stays with Ma in Bed while Jack sleeps in Wardrobe. Jack\u2019s Ma blows his mind by telling him that she used to live Outside, and that Old Nick stole her and brought her to Room seven years ago. She has a plan for them to get out of Room, but Jack can\u2019t believe that the things he\u2019s seen on the fuzzy TV screen for years are real. How can there be anything but him and Ma and Room?The premise for this book sounds like something that a Stephen King or Dean Koontz would have come up with, and it certainly works as a kind of horror novel as Jack\u2019s innocent depiction of life inside Room shows Ma to be the victim of a horrible crime that she is trying to shield her son from. What makes this so chilling and heartbreaking is Jack\u2019s view of the Room as the entire world, and he has so adapted to it that the very idea of real people existing outside of it is something akin to blasphemy to him.The writing here is exceptional, and Emma Donoghue makes what could be an over-the-top plot into a character based and all too plausible story. It\u2019s creepy and chilling and terrible and intriguing and kind of sweet. Mostly, it's all kinds of messed up. Perhaps the most horrible thing about Room is that Old Nick doesn\u2019t believe in providing books because there\u2019s plenty of TV to watch, and poor Ma is stuck rereading a few paperbacks like Twilight and The DaVinci Code over and over. It\u2019s a fate worse than death\u2026."}, {"userName": "Tulpesh Patel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/639407-tulpesh-patel", "userReview": "Based on, or \u2018inspired by\u2019 shocking cases like that of Josef Fritzl, Room is the story of a boy, Jack, born and raised with his captive mother in a 12 foot square room. Narrated by the boy himself, it\u2019s a child\u2019s eye view of a small world housing a great deal of imagination, pain and love. Packed with the emotional punch and occasional humour that comes with having a child narrator, comparisons will inevitably be drawn to John Boyne\u2019s The Boy with the Striped Pyjamas. In my opinion, Room surpasses that book because the protagonist feels more real; Donoghue accomplishes the job of not only getting inside the head of a child, as Boyne very cleverly, but more cloyingly did, but she also has a protagonist who\u2019s only experience of the world is a television with four fuzzy channels and his mother\u2019s stories, which adds a whole new, tougher and more horrific, dimension.In describing the lives of these two captives in this tiny room, Donoghue exercise as much, if not more, imagination than creators of entire universes, like Tolkien. The tiny attention to detail paid to their room and Jack\u2019s description of it, makes it an all too real and terrible place. It\u2019s not really a plot-driven book, although I found my heart racing on several occasions, desperate to find out what happens to this dear, naive little boy. It is definitely a book that is difficult to write about with revealing spoiling for those who are yet to enjoy it. At its core I guess it\u2019s about the indomitable human spirit, but there is a palpable sadness and desperation that makes gripping but painful reading. There is more violence contained in a muttered line about cork floorboards than a dozen Bret Easton Ellis novels put together, a true testament to Donoghue\u2019s skill at creating empathy for Jack and his mother. Room definitely deserves its place on the Booker Prize short-list but it is far from perfect. The focus on the two central characters leaves others in the novel feeling like broadly painted caricatures. There are also some clever post-modern allusions to the cult of celebrity, which provide neat satire, but these are tangled with occasional moments, largely towards the end of the novel, where Jack\u2019s voice feels a just a little too much like the author\u2019s commentary on modern life, rather than simply Jack\u2019s view of the world. I very much agree with the Audrey Niffenegger quote on the sleeve: \u201cWhen it\u2019s over you look up: the world looks the same but you are somehow different and that feeling lingers for days\u201d.

I think the story is poignant and indeed deserved to be told, but not from the 1st person POV of a child.I managed to read more than half of it, and when I did reach the halfway point I became so happy I was closer to the end, but then I realized that I should never feel this way reading a book for pleasure.This book brought me no pleasure whatsoever.

No? Well, it\u2019s about this Italian Jew who is sent to a concentration camp with his wife and son during World War II, and in order to shield his son from the horrors of war, he tells him that they are really just playing a super fun game and that everyone in the camp is a contestant. Not surprisingly, his son believes the whole thing (kids are pretty dumb, right?) and he is able to maintain this ruse right up until the Allied invasion. So, Room is kind of like that except without the Allied invasion. Here you\u2019ve got this 5 year-old kid whose mother feeds him a pack of lies to prevent him from knowing the truth about their actual state of existence\u2014which is that they are trapped in someone\u2019s backyard shed and probably will never see the light of day again. My inclination is to mention what happens next, but then I think I would be doing the book a disservice. What I can say, however, is that the entire novel is narrated by the 5 year-old schmuck, and while this may sound like it could be annoying, it really isn\u2019t.

Hearing that it's being made into a movie is intriguing. I'm always excited/anxious when this happens as I worry that it will replace some of things I loved most about the book...if that makes sense. This book had such a hold on me that I finished it in two sittings. After I was done it was all I could think about for days and still think about quite often. Dora the Explorer was on TV as I was flipping channels the other day and I immediately thought of this novel again. Told from the point of view of five-year-old Jack (child-speak and all) was unexpected but ended up being wonderful. It took a little time (maybe 10 pages) to get used to following Jack's train of thought but after that it was easy. He stole my heart! I was drawn into their private world right from the beginning. Even though Ma is not a main voice in the novel a vivid picture is given from Jack's descriptions. I could feel the love she had for Jack while she struggled to keep it together for herself and her son. I was so impressed by her resourcefulness and how she even helps Jack somewhat thrive in a place she desperately wants to escape. An amazing and heart-wrenching story of love and survival. Although there is much dark subject matter I felt it was handled gently. My emotions were wrung out and it truly made me thankful for my freedom and the freedom of my child. It kept me tightly gripped and on the edge of my seat until the very end. Definitely an extremely riveting and powerful read that I highly recommend.

I was very undecided about stars, but there are many much better books I've given 3*, so this gets 2*, even though there was, on reflection, more to it than I first thought. The quality of the writing is not sufficient for 3*.Overall, I think it\u2019s poorly written (exacerbated by the way Donoghue tries to use unusual language for specific effect), but it is something of a page-turner, it\u2019s quite a quick read (unless you overempathise, get depressed, and need a break) and it does contain some interesting ideas, especially in the second half about aspects of coping with \u201cfreedom\u201d (though I am unsure how many are taken directly from news reports and interviews with former captives, and how many are her own).OVERVIEWThe situation is well-known: a twenty six year old woman, \u201cMa\u201d, is living with her five year old son, Jack, in a tiny locked room. She has been there since she was abducted aged nineteen, and the story is narrated by Jack. They have daily visits from their captor, who brings meagre supplies, though they do have a TV and half a dozen books. Jack thinks reality is everything in their room, and that everything \u201cin TV\u201d is pretend.The first half of the book is set in Room (yes, with a capital letter and no article (\u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d), like most of the few objects in their lives), and the second half is on the outside. It is clearly influenced by the recent news stories of Natasha Kampusch and Jaycee Lee Duggard etc, and that potentially prurient aspect did hold me back from reading this book for a long time. But I subsequently learned that Donoghue has said she was more influenced by the Fritzl case, which seems odd, because that was fundamentally different, as the abductor, imprisoner, and impregnator was the father of the young woman (more than one, initially).LANGUAGE AND WRITINGRight from the start, I found the narration annoying - not because it's by a 5-year old, but because he's such an unconvincing 5-year old. For example, he has a very good vocabulary for his age (fair enough), and yet there are a few really basic words that he seems not to know (instead of \"a man\" or \"the woman\" he refers to \"a he\" and \"the she\" - except on one occasion when he unaccountably gets it right), and he often gets irregular past tenses and word order wrong, in the way that children younger than five often do (\u201cI winned\u201d, \u201cwe knowed\u201d, \u201cI brung\u201d, \u201cwhy you don\u2019t like\u201d and to a driver, \u201cmay you go us please to\u2026\u201d). Furthermore, he repeatedly makes these errors despite his mother's diligence in correcting his grammar and the fact he watches TV. It\u2019s almost as if you can see Donoghue weighing up the need for Jack to be intelligent and insightful enough to tell the story in an engaging way (which, to a large extent, he does) with the need to tick certain boxes to make it clear he is just a small child. Similarly, we\u2019re expected to believe that Jack points out \u201ca dog crossing a road with a human on a rope\u201d and thinks someone lighting up is trying to set himself on fire, even though he\u2019s had TV and a mother who has tried to teach him about the (fictitious) world.The fact Jack is still breastfed is not surprising: it\u2019s comforting for both of them. What is surprising though is that the word itself seems to be taboo (instead, he talks about \u201chaving some\u201d, without ever saying what), and yet he\u2019s happy to use the words \u201cpenis\u201d and \u201cvagina\u201d, and is open about bathing with his mother. That may sound like nit-picking, but it\u2019s an example of the sort of thing that frustrated me. I just didn\u2019t feel Donoghue had really thought it through thoroughly. If you\u2019re going to play with language to make your point, you need to be able to do so convincingly.PLOTThe book is in five sections, though really it falls more naturally into two: inside and outside. The relationship between mother and son is touching and the book opens by establishing the routines and rituals of their restricted life, including the almost liturgical way they say \u201cgood night\u201d to all their (few) possessions: \u201cGood night, Room\u2026 good night, Rug\u201d etc. The creativity required to raise a child in a confined space with such limited resources are impressive, too (they blow their eggs, so the whole shells can be threaded to make a snake, and do PE using their limited furniture as gym props).Initially, and in some ways, their life doesn\u2019t seem as bad as you might expect, and even the first appearance of their captor (\u201cOld Nick\u201d) is relatively benign. That reflects the way Ma is raising Jack in the most positive way she can. Of course, we know something of the real horrors of the story, and they are discussed, though never in graphic detail, in part because Jack\u2019s comprehension is limited, and in part because of Ma's success in shielding him from the nature of the situation.I thought the escape was badly done, but much better is the when, leading up to it, Ma has to explain to Jack that what he\u2019s seen \u201cin TV\u201d is real. They go through a confusing process of \u201cunlying\u201d as she tries to prepare him for what might follow an escape. Once outside, it\u2019s superficially about the practicalities of adjusting to the real world, but really it\u2019s questioning the nature and price of freedom. I found this part had more interesting ideas, but contained more implausibility of plot (though I\u2019m no expert in such matters) and very flat new characters. In particular, the method and speed with which the police locate Room was absurd, and also some of the logistics, practicalities and oversights of those charged with their care and settlement on the outside were dodgy, such as the first planned trip for these traumatised celebrities being to a museum with an uncle whom Jack had only met once!WHAT IS FREEDOM?The reader roots for Ma and Jack to escape, and they do (no spoiler \u2013 the book blurb tells you). Hooray! But of course they soon discover a new form of captivity: medical/psychiatric, hiding from fame, and so on. And this is where it gets interesting and starts to feel more plausible. Jack\u2019s only knowledge of outside is from occasional TV programmes, and Ma\u2019s is from seven years ago, when she was a carefree student, rather than a traumatised mother. Jack has to discover the world, and Ma has to (re)discover a new version of herself; she tells Jack, \u201cI know you need me to be your ma but I\u2019m having to remember how to be me as well\u201d, to which he replies, \u201cBut I thought the her and the Ma were the same\u201d. Similarly, having more, can leave one feeling impoverished: Jack is puzzled when Ma cautions him to be careful of something her brother gave to her, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was hers-not-mine. In Room everything was ours.\u201dSome of the things they struggle to cope with are not ones that would initially have occurred to me (germs, sunburn, stairs), and one effect is to make it almost as if Jack has acquired Asperger\u2019s syndrome: he can\u2019t filter the multiple stimuli of a busy world; doesn\u2019t understand social conventions, etiquette, and privacy; is confused by relationships and pronouns (\u201cThe \u2018you\u2019 means Ma, not me, I\u2019m getting good at telling\u201d); takes common idioms literally (such as \u201cI\u2019m afraid so\u201d and \u201cget his act together\u201d, but surely some cropped up from Ma and TV?); doesn\u2019t like being touched or having to wear shoes; is borderline agoraphobic; increases his counting-his-teeth stress-relieving tactic; is uncoordinated from poor spatial perception; and feels insecure without routine. Jack asks, \u201cBut what\u2019s the rule?\u201d, to which he is told \u201cThere is no rule.\u201d That\u2019s a liberating idea to Ma, but scary to Jack. He misses Room and his few possessions because it\u2019s all he\u2019d ever known; Ma, understandably, wants to leave it all behind both literally and in even from conversation and memory. When he has nightmares, the doctor says \u201cNow you\u2019re safe, it\u2019s [the brain] gathering up all those scary thoughts you don\u2019t need any more, and throwing them out\u201d, but Jack disagrees, \u201cactually he\u2019s got it backwards. In Room I was safe and Outside is the scary.\u201dAnother aspect is how Ma\u2019s family react. The girl they knew \u2013 and thought dead \u2013 has been replaced by someone similar, but different, and they have Jack to contend with. Ma loves him unconditionally, despite his parentage, but if you were her mother or father, how would you feel about this constant reminder of what happened?To sum up, this wasn\u2019t as prurient as I feared, and it was very thought-provoking, but it could have been SO much better.THE FILMThe only occasions I've preferred a film to the original book are where I didn't enjoy the book. I'm told the film of this is excellent, especially the boy who plays Jack. A couple of friends, who knew my reasons for disliking this, have almost persuaded me to see it. I don't think I'll pay money to watch it in the cinema, but once it's on TV, I might. With the right cast, and subtle direction and dialog, I may change my views of what should be a powerful story."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "What makes up the world to five-year-old Jack, our window into life in Room? His mother for sure, a loving, very engaged 24/7 presence. Old Nick is an occasional visitor, although only glimpsed through the almost-closed doors of a wardrobe. A skylight allows Jack and Ma to see the sun, and sometimes the moon. A television offers a view on Outside, the world beyond Room. Jack and his 26-year-old mother get through their days with a strict schedule, a rich imaginative life and absolute love for each other. They need all those things. Jack has never seen the outside of their eleven-foot-square room. His mother has been held prisoner by a madman for seven years. One might think that it would be a strain to read an entire adult novel in the voice of such a young child. I felt trepidatious for a while, myself. But once I got used to the norms of Jack\u2019s speech, the rest just flowed. A child and mother held prisoner for so long is nothing less than a horror story. It was uncomfortable to read, and reminded me of the feelings summoned by some of Stephen King\u2019s scarier efforts. But Room is not just a tale of terror, of captivity and isolation. It delves into larger issues, particularly in the latter chapters. What is real? What is just an image seen on a TV screen? Are we better off, in some ways, to live in a world that has everything defined, ordered, secure, than having to cope with actual reality? Where does one draw that line? Room was inspired, at least in part, by actual, disturbing, events. In Austria, a young woman, Elizabeth Fritzl, was imprisoned for 24 years by her serial-rapist father, bearing him seven children. One of those died as a result of the evil father refusing to seek medical treatment for him. There are echoes of that event here. But while a real-life horror story may have been a basis for the book, Room is not a downer. It offers both the dark excitement of a scary story and a thoughtful look at what defines us as people. In contrast to the monstrous, Donaghue gives us an inspirational, loving parent in the same vein as Roberto Benigni\u2019s Guido Orefice from It\u2019s a Beautiful Life. Ma makes a real life for Jack. Donaghue offers a caustic look at contemporary media as well, presenting the media as severely truth-challenged and lacking in insight and ethics. A TV interviewer is insulting in her stupidity. I was convinced by the voice Donaghue gave Jack, the true strength of her writing here. But I found that towards the back end of the story, Jack started sounding much too grown-up, and was clearly serving as the author\u2019s avatar. But for the vast majority of her book, Donaghue carries it off, amazingly. The story is compelling, the writing creative and effective. If you don\u2019t make room for Room on your reading list, you won\u2019t know Jack, and that would be a shame.In light of recent (2013) events in Ohio, this book should see a revival in interest.==============================EXTRA STUFF7/3/13 - I happened across Oprah selecting Room as one of eleven books to devour on a long flight."}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "This book was as interesting and twisted as I hoped it would be! The writing style was slightly jarring and I got one sentence into the audiobook before going NOPE (annoying child voice... argh), but I did end up enjoying it once I got further into it!This book's main selling point is that it's not just your average trauma story of being locked in isolation-- it's told through the eyes of a child, and that room is all he's known for his entire life. I went into this expecting almost a thriller, a \"will they get out of that situation???\" type of storyline, but I was wrong. This follows more of a \"can they get out, and when they do, can they live normally in the outside world after being locked up for so long?\" And I liked that version more than I thought I would. Although half way through this book it wrapped itself up and felt very weird to continue onward, I did enjoy seeing the character progress throughout the end of the book, and although I wish we could have seen from someone other than Jack's perspective (he got exhausting and frustrating after a while), I think this would be a REALLY good book to discuss amongst friends and I'm sure the movie is very jarring.There were certain points that gave me chills so bad that I had to put the book down, just because the severity of what these characters went through was so chilling, and all of it is undermined by the fact that the entire thing is told from the perspective of someone that's too young to understand. I just think this book brings up great controversies, was a tragic story of a mother and son who had to go through hell, and it was just as gripping and unforgettable as I hoped it would be. My only complaint is the pacing throughout the middle of it, and Jack's voice growing irritating after a while."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Arabey", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13592557-mohammed-arabey", "userReview": "A Book Room to Remember..

Even Grandma often says that, but she and Steppa don't have jobs, so I don't know how persons with jobs do the jobs and all the living as well.In Room me and Ma had time for everything. I guess the time gets spread very thin like butter all over the world, the roads and houses and playgrounds and stores, so there's only a little smear of time on each place, then everyone has to hurry on to the next bit....\u201d \nHow we really care less than we think..\n\u201cAlso everywhere I'm looking at kids, adults mostly don't seem to like them, not even the parents do. They call the kids gorgeous and so cute, they make the kids do the thing all over again so they can take a photo, but they don't want to actually play with them, they'd rather drink coffee talking to other adults.

How this book is anything but blither is beyond me. The reality is that the plot for this book was ripped from the headlines, based on the stories of Jaycee Dugard, Natascha Kampusch, and the Fritzl family. Emma Donoghue was given a $2 million advance to write Room. With cash in hand and only a plot outline, clearly no one gave a shit if the final work were good or not. What a better way to save face than to tout a piece of crap book you actually paid someone to write as a \"gem.\" UGH. In the end, all we have is yet another author exploiting and getting rich off of the real life tragedies of others. I suppose I wouldn't mind so much -- hey, I may even cheer it on -- if it were done well. In this case, it was done horribly. You see, if you truly do want to hear the blabbering of a 5 year-old for 300 pages, then you immediately need to change careers and become a kindergarten teacher. Look. It takes talent to write in the voice of a child, which is precisely why so few authors are successful at it. When a good author writes from a child's perspective, the book becomes a classic. Think about it. J.D. Salinger, Harper Lee, Roald Dahl, and James Joyce. As for the rest of them? The child narrator is nothing more than a laughable gimmick. Emma Donoghue falls flat on her face -- and drags us down with her -- for an entire novel with that very gimmick. I don't have patience for \"silly penis is always standing up in the morning. I push him down,\" nor \"penis floats,\" and especially not \"my poo is hard to push out.\" I don't care for rambling recounts of Dylan the Digger and Dora the Explorer, either. Further, I found it odd that a child who is remarkably well-versed in the narrative would have such huge inconsistencies in his spoken English, many times sounding like a 3 year-old while at other times having perfect grammar. Huh? Finally, I got rather annoyed by Capitalizing Nouns and Other Objects in the Room, I found it Distracting and Annoying, and to me it screams Piss Poor Writer. Don't forget to throw in some of Donoghue's own politics for fun: our 5 year-old is still breastfeeding and he loves to tell us which boob produces the creamiest milk. Don't be disgusted. After all, it's natural! And let's not forget the most blatant and frankly, lame, self-insertion by an author into her own novel: Noreen is a kind and clever nurse who hails from merry ol' Ireland, just like our author. BARF. Forgive me for not passionately hating this book more. Quite simply, it bored the hell out of me. I spent half the time wishing someone would throw the narrator back in the room so he'd shut the hell up. I spent the other half wanting to slap Donoghue's publishers.

I won't say what happens in the end, but the ending was dependent on the second half of the book, where we got to know one of the two main characters in the book.There is Jack, and then his mother. Curiously enough, Jack is the narrator, and his POV is unique. He lends strength to his mother, he makes her shine with her patience, her fortitude, and her bravery. I have yet to watch the movie version, but it's no coincidence that the actress playing the role of Ma, Brie Larson, got the oscar for best actress this year.Jack is sometimes gullible sometimes not. Sometimes he expresses curiosity. The latter sentiment is the driving force behind a child's growth. Us adults lose something when we have understood our version of the Room.
