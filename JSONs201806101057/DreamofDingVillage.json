The bones shivered in the starry night while the robust voice of Ma Xianglin danced to the tunes of the fiddle; the smell of stale blood fading in the stench of a blood merchant. As Ma Xianglin sang, the bright-red bridal jacket matched wits with Lingling\u2019s cheeks as they blushed to Ding Liang\u2019s flirty stares. As Ma Xianglin sang, Li Sanren saw his fate in the red sesame dots plastered on his arm; the grunting of a pig made Zhao Xiuqin quiver at thought of the animal feasting on her last rice bag. The anxiousness of finding a cure prevailed in the vindictive heavens, the wrinkles on Grandpa Ding\u2019s forehead deepened like the concave shadows of the coffins. As Ma Xianglin sang, Ding Village trembled as the blood thickened. Faces popping out through serpentine lines, hopeful souls jutting out blood- filled veins, feeding the hungry mouth of a needle; the scent of money coagulating in the sharp odour of fresh blood, the optimism of a better life floating in the swirls of endless blood streams, the remnants of fate engraved on the discarded cotton balls. The cry of a child piercing through the brick walls, as its parents shook their \"blood tree\u201d. The people of Ding Village had found a treasure which flowed within their bodies. Gazing into a bloody puddle, there I stood watching my own reflection amid the squalor and chaos wondering about my survival in this battle between life and death, only to it being trampled by Ding Hui\u2019s greedy grin. The puddle was gone, so was my reflection and gone was the blood from the veins; the fiddle had stopped playing but Ma Xianglin\u2019s melodies lingered through the lanes of the Ding Village and I was still standing on the barren land, whiffs of rusty blood emitting from crying souls.\n\u201cEver since the blood came. Ever since the blood ran red.\u201d\nBlood is like a \u201cnatural spring\u201d which never runs dry; the words of the government official were magical to the impoverished villagers. How foolish they were frolicking in their own illiterate ways of ploughing the fields when they had a gold mind resting within them. How scheming was the government to target impoverished existence for their egotistical monetary gains. What a mess of humanity! When stomachs burn with hunger, when a single bag of rice becomes the fetching prize of livelihood and when societal discrepancies value an ounce of life on monetary scales of rich and poor, one can\u2019t really blame the need or the immense desire to acquire money. Thus, it did not shock me when the villagers were mesmerized by the economical rise of the neighbouring county even as the blood banks proliferated simultaneously. Life had become scarier than selling blood. The blood boom planted the very first seedling of prosperity in Ding Villages. Life had become much more pleasing and affluent. As the blood ran more fervently into various blood banks, new houses saw the light of the day. Domestic amenities that once were only a luxuriant illusion were now a reality. The farmers of Ding Village bathed in the remunerations of their \u201cnatural spring\u201d. Ever since the blood came to Ding Village, the villagers were in high spirits. Selling blood had become a commonplace with self-nominated \u2018blood heads\u2019 going door to door with their medical equipment buying blood like boisterous salesmen. Blood plasma had become a crisp 100-yuan gifting benefactor. Blood had replaced the shrine of Guan Yu hailing its power of wealth.As the veins puffed-up bursting with blood, so did the insatiability for money. As the leaves became red with the ambiance of blood, corruption seeped through the streams of blood and money. The birth of \u2018blood heads\u2019 or \u2018blood merchants\u2019 saw the growth of middle-men who strived solely for pecuniary revenues and supremacy. The blood ran red and with it fetched immorality of human sensibilities embedding the dreaded fever that muted the voices of Ding Village.The dream of Ding Village was a bloodied reverie.\n\u201cThe fever hid in blood; Grandpa hid in dreams. The fever loved its blood; Grandpa loved its dreams.\u201d\nGrandpa Ding\u2019s dreams are an important part of the prose as they preserve the quintessence of the narrative. Ding Shiuyang knew that the fever ravaging the bodies was the dreaded AIDS. Death had become a routine scenario and the yearning for life as muddled as the infected blood that ran through the veins. The hope of finding a cure was as feeble as the bodies of the villagers. The fever brought with it the bedlam of corruption, greediness, the omnipotent ruthless world of real estate, love, infidelity, treachery, the raging callousness of government officials and ultimately the horror of death. The meteoric rise of prosperity was bloodied amid the angry \"red sesame \u2013seeds like dots\". The \u2018fever\u2019 had wrecked the body\u2019s immunity, but the fight for life had to be continued, because until the last breathe one has to go on living and one has to find a concrete reason to live in that period of time, just like Ding Liang had found one in Lingling and Zhao Dequan in Lingling\u2019s red jacket. To those who find death daunting than life, have not yet met the people of Ding Village. In the world of blood-selling there were no perfect endings. The gluttony of money even prevailed in the fraudulent commerce of coffins. To the people of Ding Village, even the respite of death was marred by deception and betrayal. Grandpa Ding\u2019s school was too a victim of human insensitivity.Yan Lianke\u2019s novel braved the initial storm of censorship as it stood tall among the numerous malicious controversies, depicting a fictitious take on the real life blood- selling chaos in the Henan province in China in the early 1990s, which claimed lives of several thousand rural folks. Due to the booming research in bio-technological sector, the government of China commenced on the Plasmapheresis campaign that spread drastically in the interiors of the Chinese rural landscape. The popular campaign of \u2018plasma economy\u2019 became a prosperous industry of blood and money trade benefiting both the pharmaceutical companies and the impoverished villagers. The financial explosion that ruled for more than decade saw the rise of various fraudulent elements (middle-men) indulging in reckless practice of via the application of used needles and unhygienic medical environment. The ravenous greed for money and power spun a web of fallacy and corruption that ranged from blood trading for profit, the governmental targeting of the naive illiterate and impoverished villages, the illicit sale of free-governmental coffins and other workings of banned activities. Yan Lianke, also touches upon the subject of \u2018ghost marriages\u2019. The age old-tradition of marriage beyond life was also marred by corrupted functioning of Ding Hui, becoming another money-making institution. And, analogous to Ding Hui\u2019s efforts to escape the criminal indictment by declining to face the veracity of the crime, the Chinese government too has been turning a blind eye to the entire malicious scandal. The residue of the tragedy still thrives in the malevolent residue that is trickled through blood with every new birthing generation.\n\u201cThey died like falling leaves. Their light extinguishing, gone from this world.\u201d\nIn life they inched towards death and in death they crawled towards life. In the quest of finding love for their life, the people of Ding Village bled not only from their arms but from their souls too. The juicy tomato glistened in the blazing sun waiting to be picked; the voice of Ding Qiang ascended beyond the graves resonating into the bloody streaks patterned onto the white funeral scrolls; the cold mountainous terrains guarded its once precious jewel because at the end of it all when the smell of life weakens amongst changing seasons, someone needs to recite the tales of the buried. Some stories must be told. Thank you, Mr. Yan Lianke for being the voice for the voiceless!The price of blood emptying in stolen coffins and mislaid humanity."}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "At first, this novel seems like an extensive and overwrought parable - a local village gets into the business of selling its blood for a quick source of cash, and the village itself begins to die.But the story becomes more horrifying once you know that it is real - Henan Province in China experimented with a 'Plasma Economy' system in the 1990s, offering villagers money for blood donations. But the program is a disaster - using dirty cotton balls, mixing multiple blood samples in a centrifuge, and re-using needles. When the program was rolled up in 1995, over one million people were infected with AIDS in that one province alone, and with some villages having over a 60% infection rate. The novel grows grotesque as time passes - the elementary school becomes a hospice, and the man who runs the blood-selling program then moves into the coffin business (after selling the ones the government gave him for free), and then into the business of marrying the deceased so they will not be lonesome in the afterlife. The book is also a story about censorship - the author toned down any references to the government's wrongdoing or negligence, but that was not enough. The book was banned from publication and distribution, and that was almost the end of it. (It is still easy to find a pirated copy, however. Just type the Chinese title into Google).Dream of Ding Village is a book which moves through allegory and imagery, with recurring dreams and unearthly imagery - the villagers' arms look like slices of fatty pork, for example. It is melodramatic too often, but slips away into a more somber mood as the characters die off and white funeral scrolls hang in the windows. It is the story of a wholly preventable tragedy."}, {"userName": "Libros Prestados", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36773851-libros-prestados", "userReview": "Este libro me ha parecido denso, pero no s\u00e9 si porque lo es o porque yo estaba densa. No digo \"denso\" en un sentido intr\u00ednsecamente malo, sino que me ha costado leerlo, he tenido que espaciar la lectura en el tiempo, porque no pod\u00eda leer demasiadas p\u00e1ginas cada d\u00eda.No es un libro de tem\u00e1tica f\u00e1cil, de hecho, es muy duro: nos narra la situaci\u00f3n de una aldea china donde la mayor parte de la poblaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 infectada con el virus VIH por la venta de sangre a gran escala que se produjo en la zona, alentada (m\u00e1s bien obligada) por el gobierno, y que resultaba en su d\u00eda una muy atractiva fuente de dinero. Habla de muerte, de abandono de las autoridades, de corrupci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica, de codicia desmedida, de lo bajo que podemos caer los seres humanos. Y tal vez lo que m\u00e1s me haya costado es precisamente lo bellamente que est\u00e1 contado. Es casi l\u00edrico. Narra momentos horribles con una prosa tan bonita que por un momento casi olvidas lo que est\u00e1 contando. Casi. Tambi\u00e9n mezcla lo on\u00edrico con lo real, con ese abuelo (padre del mayor responsable de la compraventa de sangre en el pueblo) que va viendo los estragos de la enfermedad en sus vecinos y sue\u00f1a con lo que ocurre m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la aldea. C\u00f3mo esto al final se une al brutal crecimiento econ\u00f3mico de China, que al final va dejando sus propias v\u00edctimas.No es un libro para leer en cualquier momento, como he dicho es muy duro, pero Yan Lianke expresa el horror de forma po\u00e9tica y es al final una denuncia necesaria de unos hechos que siguen siendo ocultados en China.

It was like a fad, encouraged by the government. Whole villages got into it. It was really lucrative. People bought houses with blood money. You can probably guess what happened next, right? Everyone died of AIDS.Yan Lianke turns this into an allegory, which you can see why that was tempting. This is big business and the government, profiting by poisoning the blood of the deceived masses. It's basically allegorical already. He doesn't make the story quite as engaging as you think it'll be. There's a lot going on here: one guy is selling arranged marriages between dead people so they have company in the afterlife, while another tries to have one last conjugal fling with his wife in order to infect her so she can't remarry when he's gone. Two of the infected find each other in a grotesque and moving love story. All this should be 100% gripping, right? It's only 80% gripping. I don't know why Lianke chooses to have a dead kid narrate the whole thing.But still: that's a crazy story, right? The things people will do to each other in this world. Even a slightly-too-arty job with it will be very good, and that's what this is. It's totally worth a read."}, {"userName": "Dagio_maya ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69893331-dagio-maya", "userReview": "- Gennaio 2015- Il sogno cinese Il romanzo prende spunto dalla massiccia campagna per la raccolta di sangue svoltasi in Cina negli '80 che ebbe come conseguenza un'intensa diffusione di Aids nei pi\u00f9 sperduti villaggi dell'Henan.La voce narrante \u00e8 quella di un morto: un bambino avvelenato per vendetta contro il padre colpevole di aver comprato e venduto sangue.

Il mito della ricchezza (dell\u2019accumulo di beni solidi e liquidi) \u00e8 veramente in Cina molto sentito. Non molto tempo fa ho letto una notizia curiosa quanto esemplare in questo senso: un uomo passa 48 ore chiuso in un Internet Point a cercare il modo per avviare un'impresa e diventare ricco. Lo stress lo fa svenire e va in coma. Rimane in coma per ben due anni durante i quali la famiglia ed il personale medico cercano di stimolare in tutti i modi il risveglio.

A quanto pare era l'unico motivo che poteva fargli tornare la voglia di vivere!!!Questo aspetto nel romanzo di Yan Lianke \u00e8 molto presente ma non si avrebbe un'idea pi\u00f9 completa della Cina se non si presentassero anche le contraddizioni in cui \u00e8 immersa. Accanto alla spudorata ricerca di soldi sopravvivono tradizioni arcaiche che stridono con questo anelito alla modernit\u00e0 una fra queste (e che troviamo anche nel romanzo) \u00e8 rappresentata dai i cosiddetti \"matrimoni fantasma\". Si organizzano veri e propri matrimoni tra defunti morti giovani e non sposati.

Poverty stricken farmers began eagerly selling their blood, and many small villages in rural areas saw a temporary boom in prosperity. Temporary, because the blood collection practices spread HIV. Yan Lianke is from Henan Province, where some estimates say one million people were infected and entire villages were wiped out by the virus. Dream of Ding Village is the story of one such place.The book's narrator is 12 year old Ding Qiang. He is a ghost, poisoned by the sick villagers as retaliation for his father's blood collection business. Qiang's dad, Ding Hui, was the biggest \"bloodhead\" in three counties. When people didn't come to his collection stations, he put his tubes and needles into the basket of his bicycle and head into the fields. With tales or riches and/or patriotic duty, he'd convince the farmers to lie down under a nearby tree, 700 cc collection bags (labeled 500 ccs for payment purposes) hanging from a convenient branch.Qiang's Grandpa, Professor Ding, feels guilty for his son's role in the illness of the villagers. He gathers the sick into a cooperative community in the local elementary school where they can share scarce resources and not worry about infecting their families. But illness makes some people desperate and others heedless of consequences. Meanwhile, Ding Hui has a new business - intercepting the free coffins provided by the government and selling them to anxious villagers.I think I'd have liked this more if I hadn't just read The Vagrants by Yiyun Li, about the denunciation and execution of a counterrevolutionary in 1979 China. While Yan's characterizations fit his narrator, I found myself wishing for Li's deeper insights into the villagers and especially the Ding family. Still, it tells an important story and leaves you with unforgettable images.

Eine Mischung aus Fatalismus und dem festen Glauben an ein Leben nach dem irdischen Tod sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass man sich mehr darum k\u00fcmmerte, wie man starb, als dass man starb. Nachkommen, die die Riten f\u00fcr die Verstorbenen durchf\u00fchren, ein sch\u00f6ner Sarg, und die meisten waren zufrieden.Der Sarg spielt sowieso in diesem Roman eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Je gr\u00f6\u00dfer, sch\u00f6ner und besseres Holz verwendend, um so gr\u00f6\u00dfer das Wohlbefinden des Toten, der in ihm die Ewigkeit verbringen soll. Man liest in chinesischer Literatur immer wieder \u00fcber die Wichtigkeit eines Sargs, doch selten so ausf\u00fchrlich und spannend wie hier. Stellenweise glaubt man sich in die Beschreibung des Schilds des Achill versetzt, was Details angeht.Zu ganz gro\u00dfer Form findet Yan Lianke dann entsprechend auch bei der Beschreibung des Todes und Begr\u00e4bnisses des Onkels und seiner Lingling. Der Stolz, die Begeisterung, die Freude, die die Anwesenden des opulenten Begr\u00e4bnisses empfinden, so fremdartig vielleicht f\u00fcr uns, die wir eine v\u00f6llig andere Trauerkultur haben, ist beeindruckend, seltsam, traurig und fr\u00f6hlich zugleich, und das ist gro\u00dfe Literatur, die den Leser r\u00fchrt und im Ged\u00e4chtnis bleibt.Das Buch ist letztlich eine lebensnahe Beschreibung des menschlichen Wesens - einerseits gibt es die, die aus allem Profit schlagen wollen, egal, was dies bei anderen verursacht; gerade im so extrem pl\u00f6tzlich boomenden Kapitalismus des Chinas der Neunziger Jahre war R\u00fccksichtslosigkeit, Egoismus und v\u00f6llige Vernachl\u00e4ssigung von Umwelt und sozialer Umgebung wohl gang und g\u00e4be. Selbst in Zeiten, wo man seine restliche Lebenszeit eher in Wochen als in Jahren z\u00e4hlt, gibt es Menschen, die anderen Kranken Geld, Reis und M\u00f6bel stehlen und Lebensmittel horten. Ding Hui, der den Bewohnern des Ding-Dorfs erst ihr Blut abkauft, ihnen dann Lebensmittel und schlie\u00dflich S\u00e4rge, die er selbst umsonst bekommt, teuer verkauft, und dann noch ein Gesch\u00e4ft mit den noch unverheirateten Toten aufzieht, dass diese posthum mit anderen Toten verheiratet werden k\u00f6nnen, ist ein Musterbeispiel f\u00fcr den Gesch\u00e4ftsmann ohne Moral. Andererseits trifft man auch hin und wieder auf \u00fcberraschend selbstlose Personen in diesem Dorf, dem Spiegel f\u00fcr ganz China und letztlich die ganze Welt.Daneben ist die Erz\u00e4hlperspektive ungewohnt und spannend: Der relativ fr\u00fch verstorbene Sohn des Blutbarons Ding Hui ist, als Geist, nat\u00fcrlich allwissend und omnipr\u00e4sent, trotzdem hat er eine eigene Meinung zu allem, was passiert. So einen Geistererz\u00e4hler habe ich in dieser Konsequenz noch nicht gesehen.Gewiss ist das Buch auch eine politische Anklage an die chinesische Regierung, die ihren Bewohnern erst das Blut aussaugt, und als dann AIDS um sich greift, nichts tut, um ihnen zu helfen. Man f\u00fchlt sich stellenweise ins Mittelalter versetzt, und muss sich immer wieder ins Ged\u00e4chtnis rufen, dass die Geschichte am Ende des letzten Jahrtausends spielt. Man hofft, dass sich die Situation inzwischen verbessert hat - aber irgendwie zweifle ich daran.Nachtrag vom 18.12.2014: Nein, es hat sich nichts verbessert."}, {"userName": "Mark Staniforth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4106933-mark-staniforth", "userReview": "In 'Dream Of Ding Village' Yan Lianke, one of China's most pre-eminent and controversial novelists, tackles the harrowing topic of AIDS in his country's impoverished rural regions.Longlisted for the 2011 MAN Asian Literary Prize, 'Dream of Ding Village' is as gruelling as you might expect given its subject matter. But Lianke lends it an extra dimension by employing his trademark satire and black humour to devastating effect.Lianke's most famous work, 'Serving The People', about an affair between a red army soldier and the wife of a high-ranking Party official, was banned in his homeland and 'Dream Of Ding Village' went the same way, accused of painting an unnecessarily bleak and alarmist picture of the epidemic afflicting millions of rural Chinese.In fact, Lianke's book acts as much as an allegory of the Chinese economy's clumsy lurch towards capitalism as it does a damning indictment of a system which preaches equality but is riddled with corruption, and whose selfish clamour extends, in Lianke's expert hands, as far as the after-life.'Dream Of Ding Village' is based on the true story of an horrific period in which ruthless free-marketeers coerced villagers into selling their blood and in the process infected them with the AIDS virus, wiping out entire communities.It is narrated by the ghost of Xiao Qiang, a young boy who has been killed by his family's neighbours as retribution for the role of his father, the most prominent of the so-called blood-hounds, in spreading the disease.Entirely unabashed by the mounting tragedy, the boy's father continues to exploit the villagers, first by selling them the coffins that are meant to be given to them free by the state, then, ultimately, by convincing them to pay to marry off their dead sons and daughters so as not to leave them lonely in the after-life.He succeeds because this is a society long since rendered hopelessly na\u00efve by the bludgeoning force of multi-layered, single-party rule. As the villagers fall ill and prepare to die in increasing numbers, they blithely accept changes in authority based on nothing more than ownership of the village seal. Blackmail and corruption is endemic even among the stricken: one man even schemes to be buried with the seal so as to retain his authority after his death.This blend of hard fact - Lianke is from the province of Hunan, where the scandal was at its most devastating, and spent time living with AIDS victims and corroborating their stories - and fiction, works well in such expert hands, exposing the inherent futility of a fast-changing nation's grasp at the best of both worlds.If Liang's choice of narrator is a little contrived, and if the story is so devoid of hope and corrupt of morals so as to be hard going at times, it is also a remarkable and unforgettable book. Lianke's beautiful descriptions of such a desolate landscape sustain the reader through this gut-wrenchingly sad tale, and give a voice to the victims of the hidden tragedy he has brought so brilliantly to light."}, {"userName": "Marianne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne", "userReview": "Yan Lianke\u2019s latest work, Dream of Ding Village, is narrated by Ding Qiang: \u201cI was only twelve, in my fifth year of school, when I died. I died from eating a poisoned tomato I found on the way home from school\u2026I died not from AIDS, but because my dad had run a blood collection station in Ding Village ten years earlier. He bought blood from the villagers and resold it for a profit.\u201d Qiang\u2019s narration details how the dirt-poor villagers were coerced into selling their blood at Government-sanctioned collection stations and even, literally, \u201cin the field\u201d: the flattery or the appeal to patriotism that formed not the soft or hard sell, but the hard buy. Interspersed throughout the narration are the dreams of his Grandpa, Professor Ding Shuiyang: seemingly surreal but increasingly accurate and premonitory, from them we learn how, in the midst of abject poverty, bitterness and increasing hopelessness, some people\u2019s behaviour sinks to breathtaking greed, corruption and short-sightedness. Qiang gets to see both sides of the coin as his father, Ding Hui, was a \u201cbloodhead\u201d, who used criminally negligent blood collection practices, whilst his uncle, Ding Liang, contracted AIDS in the self-same place. Hui profits initially from buying and selling blood, then from selling Government-issued coffins to the families of the AIDS victims and developing Funeral Parks, then from matchmaking the dead so they will not be lonely in the afterlife. Dream of Ding Village portrays the death of the villagers and ultimately, the death of the village.Filled with elegant prose, rich imagery, strong characters and allegory, Yan Lianke\u2019s work exposes the nepotism and greed rife in China whilst at the same time giving us poignant moments of love, self-sacrifice and humanity between the villagers. It may be difficult to imagine that this subject matter could evoke humour, but the absurdity of certain situations (a free coffin from the Government as consolation for dying from AIDS; an AIDS couple arguing about who should die first so that a nice coffin and a good funeral will be assured; matchmaking the dead) does not fail to raise a chuckle. Yan claims that Dream of Ding Village is a sanitized version of the documentary he intends to write. If only a fraction of the events portrayed had truly happened, then it would already be a tragedy of epic proportions: it is easy to see why the Chinese authorities have banned this book. The lack of responsibility taken or reparation made would certainly warrant a cover up. Dream of Ding Village is a powerful read: in places it will leave you gasping and it will stay with you long after you turn the last page. It will also make you grateful that you donate blood under conditions so vastly different from these. Cindy Carter\u2019s excellent translation deserves a special mention."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5143619-michael", "userReview": "Dream of Ding Village is the sad and poignant story of a village destroyed when old ways meet new and the devastating effect it had on a family. The Ding family had lived in Ding Village for generations but the village is struggling with poverty a huge problem. The town directors looking to turn things around decide to open blood collecting centres were people have there blood taken in exchange for money. For a while things improve with people having more money but then illness starts to show itself among those who gave blood. The illness would soon be identified as Aids.The Ding family would be a cornerstone of this with Hui getting himself in the bussiness and becomes rich and goes to extroidary lengths like making coffins for the villagers and selling the bodies of villagers to be married. Liang Hui's brother would get infected and realising he was living on borrowed time chose to live with his lover while still married wich would cause discust in the families and villagers. Hai's father does his best to try and help the sick villagers only to find it a lost cause as he dismays with what has happened to the village and his family.This is the first book i have read from an Eastern author and is one that is very sobering considering it is based on real events. I can see why this book would be censored in China as outbreaks of desease and government ways of exploiting the situation would not look good being seen by the greater population. The real revalation for me is the clash between old and new and how things that can seem good can have terrible effects.

Ding Village is a township falling into decay, people drop dead everyday from the \"fever.\" HIV/AIDS has contaminated over half of the population which has engaged in blood selling to raise money to develop the local economy and bring its residents out of poverty. Corrupt blood brokers, or blood heads, arise to compete with government blood banks, reusing needles and dirty cotton balls on young and old, men and women, alike. The Ding family is at the center of this controversy - Ding Hui is a local blood head who has made his family rich on the backs of his neighbors; his 12 year-old son is murdered (poisoned by locals) as retribution for the many villagers that Ding Hui infected with disease, his brother is dying of AIDS, his mother died of exposure to hepatitis-contaminated blood, and his father, the unofficial town leader is begging Ding Hui to ask the town for forgiveness. But Ding Hui continues to scam the locals, rising in official ranks - when a state official tells Ding Hui that the residents of Ding Village are eligible for free caskets to bury the sick and dying, Ding Hui never delivers the message, instead, he sells off the coffins to the sick from other villages, resulting in his townspeople chopping down all of their trees to build coffins. Death is senseless and without dignity in this book, every life expendable.

It's a recent story - poorer regions of China hoped to improve their lives by selling their blood. The trade was quickly privatized, a lot of corners were cut, the blood buyers kept on re-using needles with the effect that Hepatitis and HIV spread quickly (here's a good write-up from The Economist).The story itself is told mostly with the dead child's grandfather as the main character, practically the only decent and non-greedy person in the entire village; everybody else (with the narrator's father not as main villain, but as biggest egoist) tries to make a quick buck, endlessly scheming to get more money, more things, more influence, more connections, always as egoistic as possible (for example, the party officials start a matchmaking service for dead people so that the dead won't have to live alone in the afterlife - in reality, it's to get dowries and matchmaking fees); everything falls apart, but everybody contributes their own small cut to the murder/suicide of the village. A tragedy of the commons where the resource is the village itself.Grandfather as the only one keeps on trying to help everybody with the only consequence that everybody uses him for their own gain; he hasn't understood that there are no morals left (a bit like Horv\u00e1th's Jugend Ohne Gott/The Age of Fish).

Peasants sold their blood and developed HIV and later AIDS. Some villages were wiped out when everyone died from AIDS or fled the depressing conditions of what amounted to a death camp. Just like in the Great Leap Forward, the peasants were the ones to suffer the most in these blood selling rackets. Yan Lianke does a great job showing how women AIDS patients are treated differently from men with AIDS, even though both acquired the disease through selling blood. The star of this novel is Grandpa, whose grandson is poisoned after Grandpa's son runs the blood sales in Ding Village and some villagers decide to retaliate. The story is told from the point of view of the 10 year old dead grandson. Grandpa's other son has 'the fever', ie AIDS, and is left alone when his wife leaves him. Another villager named Lingling is likewise abandoned by her husband after she contracts the fever. So Uncle and Lingling start an affair that becomes public knowledge after some of the villagers lock the pair in a shed and tell Lingling's husband about it. What ensues is a touching love story that lasts until the pair dies. Throughout the book, Grandpa dreams about the tragedies unfolding in Ding Village, dreams which all come true.

Did you already have your dosage of Mo Yan, have just realised that there's a world of great Chinese literature waiting for you out there but cannot decide on your next choice? Then go to your bookstore and find Yan Lianke's 'Dream of Ding Village.' I don't know about the English translation, but it is clear to me that they found the right translator for the Spanish edition. A devastating account of the desolation that swoops over a village in rural Henan when AIDS cuts short the lives and dreams of wealth of all its inhabitants. This is a hard book to read. There are, indeed, moments of a (very Chinese, I would dare to say) humour, glimpses of hope, friendship and shared dignity within this local community where life and death seem to be intertwined at its most. However, the story is still what it is -brutal, full of despair, an unsweetened portrait of the worst consequences of a dehumanizing 'progress' in a country where traditions and family run deeper than any political change and are bound to clash when confronted to each other.Overall, a must. However, after this book I have decided to try and find some lighter stuff. Lighter, as in, still literature but less dramatic genres. It's the risk that you take with books like these or last week's choice of Elie Wiesel's trilogy.

The translation was decent. I think Cindy Carter struck a fairly balanced chord of making it accessible to western readers while keeping (somewhat) the poetry that is Chinese writing. I found her to be among the Lisa See, Gail Tsukiyama crowd. But what surprised me most was how not depressing this book is. And yes, this book is dealing with some incredibly heavy topics, mainly death and greed and ignorance. But no matter what happens, there is always life. Life marches on despite everything. And it was that small hope that you felt throughout the story that kept it just right of the edge of depressing. Yan crafted this story with finesse and precision. While it skewers the corruption of local government, he lovingly paints the life and times of rural China. And he stayed away from the caricatures that you too often find when dealing with \"expose-type\" stories here. These are people you can find here. And I found myself invested in their lives.

I originally thought it would be good for my Chinaphile wife, but got hooked. The book quickly pulls you into a slower time that is distant and yet familiar at the same time. Somewhere between fact and fiction is Ding Village, a place in rural China that has fallen victim to the clash of socialism versus capitalism. The poor but peaceful village has been invaded by a disease. Greed has turned villager against villager, husband against wife and father against son. The villagers are literally selling their souls when they sell their blood to \"bloodheads\", shady blood dealers who accidentally bring AIDS to the land. It's sad and stirring. It reminds me of Blindness by Jose Sammarago. Unfortunately it went on too long. There's only so much misery that the poor reader can take. And in the end, the vengeance you've been expected, happens much like you thought it would. This book could've benefited from a good, and forceful, editor.

When I started reading this it felt a little too familiar... ears of corn and the \"higher ups\" are mentioned in the first few pages (though to be fair they are not mentioned much through the rest of the book). The very simple prose was the same as with The Four Books, a fable-like quality to it. This worked well in The Four Books, where Lianke was creating a story around the Great Leap Forward, getting to the essence of it, and not knowing much about China, I found it interesting. However, in Dream of Ding village, I felt that the fable-esque style was at odds with the story - of a rural village decimated by AIDS ten years after the government's blood selling schemes. It was interesting in the finding out more about China way, for the first 50-100 pages, but after that, it's people dying of AIDS, with very ordinary prose. Still, there is something I like about Lianke and will read another of his books in perhaps a couple of years.

(It's about the blood-selling scandal in which villagers were persuaded/forced to sell their blood, got infected with HIV, and died without any reparation or recognition.) It's a satire so it's funny as well as horrible, and it's more about the impact of the situation on the personalities in a small village rather than about politics and so on. It's sort of got the quality of a fable to it.It was good! Don't read if you're sad.*I was wondering about the reason for this. I suppose the Moral Vacuum at the Heart of Communist China is just what Westerners like to read about modern China, rather than chicklit or epic fantasy or whatever.
