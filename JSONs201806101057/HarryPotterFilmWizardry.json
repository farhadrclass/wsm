Harry Potter: Film Wizardry does just that: a scrapbook that encompassed the decade-long saga, where everyone from the producers, directors, and production designer explain in details how they conceptualised some of the plot points and settings; and the actors, including the three stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, hit memory lane to disclose some of the best, funniest, and sometimes most uncomfortable times they had playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the films. The book begins with a foreward from Dan, Rupert, and Emma, who gush about how much of an impact the series made in their lives. Dan remarked on the journey both he and Harry endured in the ten years; Rupert took pride in playing brave Ron Weasley, the \"ultimate ginger,\" in his words; and Emma voiced her respect for her young, annoying, brainy Muggle-born fictional counterpart she thought she had nothing in common with early in the series, but who she embraced with all her heart by the end. It then lead into the first of many producer's notes scattered throughout the book, where David Heyman, the man who read the first Harry Potter book, fell in love, and immediately insisted on making the films, explained how he began to piece the movies together well over ten years ago. Author Brian Sibley compiled the scrapbook with a combination of production notes, countless cast and crew interviews, set visits, knowledge of the book and film series, and production photos and movie stills to make the quintessential anthology of the Harry Potter film series. The book itself ended with a sneak preview of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, with nothing more than image captions under a dozen or so small photos from Gringotts and Hogwarts. Just enough of a teaser to make the reader wish there were a few more pages at the end, chronicling the end of the saga. One of best features of the book, however, was that it focuses on so many of the minor details fans could never have been expected to notice, and the production teams that worked endlessly to make them. Here you have clear shots of Daily Prophetarticles and issues, rooms filled with creatures like Buckbeak and thestrals, various angles of the Room of Requirement both from Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows: Part II, Privet Drive and Diagon Alley, and countless rooms, corridors, and facets from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (I definitely wished there were more photos than only the sneak-peek of Gringotts). \"Everybody involved in these eight films knows that we have been part of something very special, and that there will never be another experience like this one,\" proclaims producer David Heyman in the introduction. He's right, of course, and while the people who made the movies were there for births, marriages, divorces and even deaths, fans have been along for the ride, hoping for a chance to sit in the front seat. This is finally it!From tidbits like how Helena Bonham Carter perforated Matthew Lewis's eardrum with her magic wand in Order of the Phoenix, to grand designs like how the filmmakers created an entire Hogsmeade miniature village with intricately detailed micro-window displays the size of a \u00a31 note, the book simply doesn't disappoint. It's the perfect mix of fact and -- as McGonagall would say -- \"well-mannered frivolity.\"On top of all that publisher Harper-Collins inserted over half a dozen prop replicas, like your very own sealed invitation to attend Hogwarts (addressed to Mr H Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs, naturally), a Quidditch World Cup programme, and even a \"real\" Maurader's Map. There are also several fold-out pages, one of which contains the Black Family Tree Tapestry.I highly recommend 'Harry Potter Film Wizardry' for any passionate Harry Potter fan, from one proud owner of this marvelous book to you all."}, {"userName": "Reading Teen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3329955-reading-teen", "userReview": "This was one of my Christmas gifts, and I spent most of Christmas day reading this book. \ufeffIt is full of many cool things.

To some people, I can see how this might sound a little boring. It isn't. This book, this awesome book is highly recommended to anybody who is even slightly interested in Harry Potter. Even if you still think that it's boring, get for the things that come with it. Ever wanted to read the Marauder's Map? Here's your chance. And it also has snapshots from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. These pictures show The Room of Requirement before and after Fiendfyre is set to it and The Room of Requirment in it's Dumbledore's Army hideout form. It also has many concept art drawings of pretty much everything. Pretty much every page has concept art drawings of characters, creatures, and structures.Seriously, any fan of Harry Potter would be practically drooling over this book if they had any sense at all. It is highly enjoyable and it points out small details that are in the movies that you never noticed before. It is a seriously awesome book.Austinhttp://www.readingteen.net/2010/12/bo..."}, {"userName": "Radwa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5591839-radwa", "userReview": "\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u0644\u0623\u0649 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0645\u0639\u062c\u0628 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0649 \u0628\u0648\u062a\u0631 ,,\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0648\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0644\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0641\u0644\u0627\u0645 , \u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629 \u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0644\u0627\u0645"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47269270-kelly", "userReview": "So much fun!"}, {"userName": "Eline", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4331729-eline", "userReview": "Lovely book with a lot of behind the scenes info and titbits sprinkled throughout.

He says, \u201cIt all began one winter morning in 1997. My assistant Nisha came into my office to recommend an unpublished manuscript by a first-time novelist that she had enjoyed. \u201cWhat is it called?\u201d I asked. \u201cHarry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone,\u201d she replied. \u201cMmmm,\u201d I mumbled skeptically . . . . That evening, I decided to read a few pages before going to sleep. I read and I read and I read, and by the time I lay the book down and looked at my watch, it was 4:00 a.m. Jo Rowling\u2019s writing was so vivid, her imagination so rich . . . I knew immediately that I wanted to make it into a film . . . \u201dNow, keep in mind that Heyman went after the film rights before the first book was even published, and the publisher itself (Bloomsbury in London), by no means predicted the book to be a bestseller! Rowling\u2019s advance was (wait for it) only 2,500 British pounds \u2013 roughly $5000. Yup. The first printing was only 500 copies! Double yup.In HARRY POTTER FILM WIZARDRY, David Heyman explains what happened to a handful of these first edition copies: he sent them to his lucky top tier screenwriters to see if anyone was interested in penning the script. First round . . . not a single one of them wanted to write the script (Idiots! And they even got to keep their 1st editions!) But in a later round, the wonderful Steve Kloves, who has written all but one of the scripts, signed on.Another story that Heyman tells early in the book is about casting Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. I\u2019d heard the legend, but wasn\u2019t sure how accurate it was. Turns out, it\u2019s entirely true: they had been auditioning young boys to play Harry for nine long months, and with just three months before filming was scheduled to begin, they had yet to find their main character! But lo and behold, Heyman happened to be at a play one night, and sitting one row in back of him was 10-yr-old Daniel Radcliffe, every bit the boy-wizard they\u2019d been looking for. Fortunately, Daniel also happened to be an actor, and funny enough, his parents had already been approached by the film\u2019s director, Chris Columbus, about Daniel auditioning because Columbus had seen him in the BBC adaptation of David Copperfield. But (you may not believe this part), Daniel\u2019s parents hadn\u2019t wanted him to audition, and turned down the offer. But once Heyman suggested it too, the Radcliffes finally agreed, and the rest is cinematic history.Daniel was taking a bath when he learned that he\u2019d won the role :)These are just a few of the cool behind-the-scenes stories that are told in this highly entertaining book.Then there is all the mock memorabilia! I\u2019ve seen books like this before, but nothing that even comes close to how cleverly it\u2019s done here. Harry\u2019s acceptance letter to Hogwarts, a four-page fold out with a map of Diagon Alley (along with a creepy Borgin and Burkes catalog), an Advanced Potion Making text book with adhesive labels for your own home-brewed potions, a Quidditch World Cup Programme, an invitation to the Yule Ball, and among many other such treasures, your very own Marauder\u2019s Map! Oh, yes, my friends, it can all be yours!But wait, there\u2019s more!I would have bought this book for the concept art alone. Or to be more precise, for this particular sketch of Hogwarts and its surrounding grounds, penned in a matter of minutes by J.K. Rowling herself, for the production designer. In a nutshell, HARRY POTTER FILM WIZARDRY is 160 pages of pure awesomeness!!"}, {"userName": "Lisa Vegan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan", "userReview": "This is a beautifully made, informative, and fun movie companion book! Well, maybe this is nothing more than a glorified movie magazine in book form, but it gave me plenty of entertainment value. I adore the Harry Potter books and I really like the movies, and this is a fun book for fans of the movies. The book covers all 8 movies, so I got to see a (very) few scenes from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 before the movie comes out. The graphic artists who designed the films and their contents also designed this book, and they did a fabulous job, with both endeavors. There is much attention to detail, even including the printed on name plate at the beginning of the book.The book chronologically covers the 8 movies, with many other movie related things scattered throughout the book. It\u2019s very well structured, without being overly organized. The book is stuffed with plenty of photos, and there is a lot of behind the scenes information about how they did special effects, made various things and outfits, copies of many call sheets, storyboard sketches, etc. etc. etc. There are many mini interviews with cast members, directors, and others involved in the making of the films, and most of them had very interesting things to say. It\u2019s amazing all the people, skills, materials, schedules, etc. needed to make these films. I was even more impressed when I realized the attention they paid to detail, and that makes sense given the high quality of the films. Short synopses of the movies are given, along with a bit about how and why there were deviations from the books. I got a much better look at so many of the props than I did while watching the actual movies.Readers will see how J.K. Rowling was directly involved with some aspects of the filmmaking. For instance, she wanted Alan Rickman to play Snape, and when he said he couldn\u2019t play him if he didn\u2019t know the character, Rowling told him something about Snape that until that point she\u2019d told nobody else.Families with children interested in this book should buy one copy to keep pristine and at least one copy with which to play. There are all sorts of tear out and removable items: Harry\u2019s invitation to Hogwarts, programs, product catalogue, tickets, cards, the marauder\u2019s map, etc. props from the actual movies, some of them in sticker form, I think; I didn\u2019t tear out anything. There are also several pages that fold out. Because of all these loose parts and some pages easy to tear/ruin, I very much doubt that this book will be available for borrowing at very many, if any, libraries. Because of all these props, this book can serve as a toy too, one that will enhance imaginative \u201cHarry Potter\u201d play. I bought one copy that I am keeping intact and I\u2019m likely to share it with others only when the book is in my presence too."}, {"userName": "PurplyCookie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2214498-purplycookie", "userReview": "If you are a Harry Potter fanatic this is a must-have addition to your library. It covers the Harry Potter world in a virtual 3-D approach. The book is full of surprises and beautiful artwork. Mere words cannot convey the enjoyment the reader will receive from this book.This beautiful book offers a way to hold the wizarding world of Harry Potter in your hands. And as an extra special bonus there are sections about the final two films, including a preview of my favorite new discovery: Fleur's double phoenix wedding dress. Also, learn why Yule Ball ice sculptures never melt, where Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts are really \"minted,\" how to get a Hippogriff to work with actors, the inspiration behind Hogwarts castle, and why Dementors move the way they do.The level of detail in the book is amazing. For example, the Quidditch program contains an advertisement for Pumpkin Juice. You might want to order two copies: one to keep pristine; and other to take out all the special art from its protective sleeves to decorate your room or office. I would love to pretend to do Christmas shopping out of the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes catalogue! I now have a new appreciation for the talent and vision of the filmmakers whose work is highlighted here. The text explains how movie magic was accomplished, down to the special salt that stands in for snow in the models, which has diamond shaped crystals and even crunches like the real thing.The pictures, layout, and hidden goodies made the book worth the steep price. Not only is the book interesting, but it shows a lot of the objects and concepts included in the movies that you may have missed. It brings the world of Harry Potter to life as you turn each page. The artwork, footnotes, call sheets, snapshots, memories of the cast, crew and production teams all come together in a way that takes the reader into how the movies were made and feel a part of what must have been a truly remarkable experience for all involved.It's the perfect gift for any long-time (or new) Potter fan\u2014I got it for myself as a Christmas gift. You get to see, close up, so many of the magical things that were created to fill Harry's world. I know it's a clich\u00e9, but the book is almost magical. All of the special touches make it feel like you have a true treasure pulled right out of the Gringott's bank vault.More of Purplycookie\u2019s Reviews @:  http://www.goodreads.com/purplycookie Book Details: Title Harry Potter Film WizardryAuthor Brian SibleyReviewed By Purplycookie"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2411388-hannah", "userReview": "A totally entertaining book for fans of the HP movie franchise. Filled with insider tid-bits and behind-the scenes factoids from all 7 of the movies. Members from the cast and crew contribute to the sometimes funny, sometimes informative and always fascinating phenom that are the Harry Potter movies. Attention to creative and artistic detail is evident throughout the book. It's easy to get lost in just looking at all the tiny, (almost unseen), but beautifully rendered artistic elements throughtout the book. BRAVO to the creative directors responsible.As a bonus feature (of which I was deprived because this was a library book and some CRETIN stole them all from this copy), this book also contains interactive pullouts like a mauraders map, tickets to the Yule Ball, etc. - of which I am sure are every bit as cool as the rest of the book, but I cannot positively rate (because some CRETIN stole them all from my library copy).One small quibble: I do hope the publishers will re-print a revised edition of this to include information from Part II of The Deathly Hallows. Unfortunately, this edition only covered The Sorcerers Stone through Part I of The Deathly Hallows. It would be wonderful to have more information on the finale and beyond.A perfect book to spend a few hours on a lazy afternoon visiting with.

Think of it as a Harry Potter making-of extras in all of the HP movie DVDs, except they are in words (instead of in moving pictures) and more in-depth than anything I've ever seen in the DVD extras. I can't comment on it chapter by chapter; there are simply too many goodness inside this book. But suffice to say the book will appeal to those fans who are looking for collectible items AND fans who want to learn more about filmmaking, Harry Potter style.The author of this book, Brian Sibley, is the same one who made the Lord of The Rings movie companion books. Sibley is no stranger to compiling materials from movies to create a profound source of information on these epic movie series. You can bet on Sibley's thoroughness in collecting the materials. But the biggest kudos go to the publishers (and Warner Bros., I suppose), for the exclusive package this book comes in - it is hard cover, filled with 'interactive' pop-ups (Yule Ball invitations, Borgin & Burke leaflet, etc.), and an elegant Potter-esque design.

It was great to read comments from the producers, directors and actors about their experiences filming the series. It really made me appreciate how much work went into the films, especially with props and the sets. All of the concept art we get to see in the book is absolutely gorgeous, if it was available to buy I definitely would! The best thing about this book is all the the removable props you get, I am so happy to have my own Marauder's Map!!"}, {"userName": "OwlBeReading", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32931646-owlbereading", "userReview": "I kind of glossed over this one and mainly looked at the pictures because I already know all of the information. This was just a way for me to ease out of the Potter universe. Overall the formatting is great, writing spectacular, and incredibly informative. I'm going to use this as a model for my yearbook spreads!
