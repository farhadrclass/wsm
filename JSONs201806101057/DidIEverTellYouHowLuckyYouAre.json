to have stumble upon this classic called \u201cDid I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?\u201d Out of all of the Dr. Seuss books I had read over the years, this was the one that I have never even heard of before and I was interested in reading this book and see if it holds up to Dr. Seuss\u2019 other great works. Well, it turns out that it DOES measure up to Dr. Seuss\u2019 other great works and I was quite pleased with the results of this book!The book starts off with a young boy meeting up with an old man in the middle of the Desert of Drize and the old man starts singing a song to the boy about how there are more people less fortunate than he is and how he is lucky to be himself. One of my favorite passages in this book included:\n\u201cAnd suppose that you lived in that forest in France,Where the average young person just hasn\u2019t a chanceTo escape from the perilous pants-eating-plants!But your pants are safe! You\u2019re a fortunate guy.And you ought to be shouting, \u201cHow lucky am I!\u201d\nDr. Seuss has done it again with his creative lyrical proses, along with providing a deep message for the readers to relate to. I loved the fact that Dr. Seuss is narrating a story about how the boy should be lucky to be himself when there are other people out there that have worse lives than he does and it was pretty interesting in seeing the lives of other people and how hard their lives can get with whatever jobs they have to deal with. I think it brings the real world message about how life can get really tough for people, but as long as you stay as yourself, you will always be lucky in getting through life, which I think is a pretty positive message for both children and adults. Dr. Seuss\u2019 artwork is as usual creative and hilarious to look at, especially of the images of the all the different places that Dr. Seuss shows us such as the spooky Kaverns of Krock, which look like dark building arcs that bend all over the place.For anyone who is not used to Dr. Seuss\u2019 usual way with tongue twisters in his books, there are many paragraphs in this book where the wording gets a little crazy and it might be difficult for smaller children to read through. Parents might want to read this book with their children, so that they could not only help their children understand the wording in this book, but also let them have some fun with pronouncing the imaginative words in this book.Overall, \u201cDid I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?\u201d is a truly brilliant and memorable book about the importance of being satisfied with what you have that fans of Dr. Seuss should definitely pick up!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Tyler Jones", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2171826-tyler-jones", "userReview": "If you must read this bookthen you're very luckyYou don't have to reada book twelve times more yucky.True, there are no zombiesor heroes heroicinstead there's philosophy(they tell me it's \"stoic\").So if you don't like itdon't stomp, yell, and cursejust try to remember -it could have been worse."}, {"userName": "Neda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9984116-neda", "userReview": "Full of imagination & creativity..

I was looking over my Dad's shoulder at that picture of a lonely, bent coat hanger suspended from a fraying piece of twine over a rocky gorge on a seemingly uninhabited world. I felt  so bad  for that hanger, and I wanted to do whatever it took to avoid its fate.I turned out fine.Childhood existential crisis aside, this book carries a lot of great lessons and, as with all of Dr. Seuss's work, avoids being overly simplistic or cutesy. The other day in a work meeting, I used the metaphor of the bees watch watchers to win an argument. How many children's books can really remain that applicable to everyday life?"}, {"userName": "Eveline", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1215947-eveline", "userReview": "\"When you think things are bad, when you feel sour and blue, when you start to get mad\u2026 You should do what I do!

I have a slew of favorites, but I felt this one needed to be added. This little paragraph from the book reminds me that... well the obvious.Since I\u2019m from the Netherlands I didn\u2019t read them as a child, translation being impossible. I read them to my son when he was young; I enjoyed them as much as he did. You can read them at such a sing songy tone; they are pleasant, upbeat and have so many little life lessons.

I was hoping for a book that illustrated the many wonderful things we experience in every day life, instead it was a book about how horrible life could be. Even that would have some value in helping kids to appreciate what they have, but because the horribleness takes place in silly, make believe places in silly, unrealistic ways it becomes difficult to bridge the text to real life. I know that this being a Dr. Seuss book I should have expected silly, make believe notions in abundance, and I sincerely believe in the importance of silliness and making believe in everyday life, unfortunately, in this book, it makes realizing that most of us are incredibly lucky to have the lives we do look like a joke."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Al-Garawi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4650824-mohammed-al-garawi", "userReview": "Very beautiful message and hilarious concepts to get the message through."}, {"userName": "Nathanael Vetters", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66351100-nathanael-vetters", "userReview": "Classic Dr. Seuss.

The rhyming texts and unique characters remind each reader to focus on the good parts of life and never feel down about anything. The reader is transformed to far-away places in order to understand optimism. This story fits into the controlled vocabulary genre of picture books. a.) A strength from this book comes from the wild characters and comedic language to present a valuable lesson for every reader and listener. b.) Throughout this story, we meet characters such as the Schlottz, Herbie Hart, Professor de Breeze and the Brothers Ba-zoo. By using these creatives figures, students are able to grasp the importance of optimism and happiness. In addition to focusing on the outrageous characters, Suess is able to bring a comedic performance to every page with the outlandish illustrations and hilarious texts. What reader would not laugh when listening to \"Or suppose, just for instance, you lived in Ga-Zair with your bedroom up here and your bathroom up THERE!\" while imaging how crazy it would be to climb hundreds of stairs from your bedroom to your bathroom as presented in the illustration? c.) Readers will especially love meeting \"Hawtch-Hawtcher Bee-Watcher. His job is to watch....is to keep both his eyes on the lazy town bee. A bee that is watched will work harder, you see\" or be happy they are not \"poor Harry Haddow. Try as he will he cant make any shadow!\" (p. 26 & p. 35). If the language does not make the readers laugh, I know the images on pages 38-39 showing a little boy running away from the \"perilous pants-eating-plants\" from the forest of France will surely bring joy to any classroom (p. 38). Many different lessons and activities can help students understand the important message presented in this book by Dr. Seuss. Educators must always remind students how important it is to think positively about your own actions and feelings. Many students return home from school to negative, unsupportive situations; teachers can be the difference in helping students believe in themselves. A few activities the students can complete would be listing positive aspects about themselves and finding ways to create positive feelings such as reading books to make you laugh, making friends at school and completing all activities to feel a sense of accomplishment."}, {"userName": "Sadia Mansoor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42662691-sadia-mansoor", "userReview": "\u201cWhen you think things are bad,when you feel sour and blue,when you start to get mad...you should do what I do!Just tell yourself, Duckie, you're really quite lucky!Some people are much more...oh, ever so much more...oh, muchly much-much moreunlucky than you!\u201d  One of the greatest lesson this book teaches you is to always be grateful for who you are & where you are.

Even me, who makes just over what is considered the poverty line or maybe I'm just at it, am humble enough to know that my life could be worse and I am grateful for everything I have.

No matter how badly your day is going, or how unlucky you think that you are, there is always someone \"oh, mutely much-much more unlucky than you.\" I enjoy that Dr. Suess books can be such fun reads for kids, as well as have this much deeper meaning.
