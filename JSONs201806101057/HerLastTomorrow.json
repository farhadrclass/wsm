This is also the first book I've read by Adam croft.Nick is a stay-at-home mom trying to be a writer while he looks after his 5 year old daughter, Ellie. His wife Tasha works outside the home and is the bread-winner of the family and gladly holds this over him. One morning, Tasha wakes everyone up at 5:00A.M. in the morning, because she is leaving on a business trip, and doesn\u2019t have enough confidence in her husband, to get up later and have his daughter in school on time. After Tasha leaves, Nick and Ellie fall back asleep, and scrambles to get Ellie to school on time. Once buckled up in the car seat, Ellie kicks up a tantrum and demands a drawing she forgot in the house. Nick leaves her in her car seat and runs inside to get the picture.Nick\u2019s only gone for a minute, but when he returns\u2026ELLIE IS GONE! She couldn\u2019t have wandered off\u2026someone had taken her\u2026kidnapped her! But Who & Why? He was now in panic mode. The police are called to the scene, and Tasha is on her way home, but the police soon suspect Nick is involved in some way.Within 48 hours, Nick receives a ransom email from Jen Hood, advising Nick not to alert the police but follow these instructions\u2026\u201cELLIE IS SAFE. YOU CAN HAVE HER BACK AFTER YOU KILL YOUR WIFE.\u201dIn exchange for his daughter's safe return, Nick will have to do the unthinkable: he must murder his wife. What a dilemma! What would you do? What a super story premise.What will Nick do? Can he and his family survive this ordeal.? This is a fast-paced thriller with short chapters and a limited number of characters for easy reading. The only issue I had with the book is that I found the ending a bit rushed, but still an enjoyable read, and for that reason I gave it 4 stars.This was my first book I've read by this author and eagerly look forward to reading , \u201cOnly The Truth\u201d next."}, {"userName": "Malia", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia", "userReview": "This book started at a clip and really grabbed my attention, unfortunately, this did not hold through the novel.

For that reason alone, I happily accepted the offer to read this in exchange for an honest review.After the first half-dozen chapters that shift in perspective from the father to the mother, however, I decided I've never run into two more self-centered idiots (figuratively or literally). Thank heaven, I said to myself, they married each other and didn't spoil two families.And for the most part, it went downhill from there till close to the end, when the kidnapper was identified (which was a surprise to me, and for the record, that's a good thing). Even though it isn't all that bad on the whole, I just can't in good conscience round up my review to 4 stars.The reason for that, mostly, is that all the parents' paranoid thoughts, second-guessing and endlessly questioning why I'm doing/thinking/planning whatever and what the outcome might be (or not) got old almost from the git-go. To quote Nick, the father, \"If I'm so sure of myself and my decision, why am I analyzing it constantly?\"Why indeed. In the acknowledgements, the author explains that the originally self-published book (2015) went through an editing process after the current publisher picked it up, during which 30,000 words were added. That is, I suggest, about 29,999 too many.I will add, though, that the book is well written from a technical standpoint, and I re-emphasize that the premise is a solid one that I'm sure many readers will enjoy. For me, though, it fell a little bit short of really good."}, {"userName": "Linda Strong", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13684015-linda-strong", "userReview": "Nick and Tasha's marriage is showing a few cracks. He's a writer, and stay-at-home dad to their 5-year-old daughter, Ellie. Tasha works full time plus a few hours and takes pride and pleasure from what she does. In her mind, she is working for their daughter's future since Nick's earnings are hit and miss.Nick and Tasha have had words in the early am hours before taking Ellie to school. Running a little behind, Ellie throws a hissy fit in the car because of a drawn picture she's left in the house. Nick leaves her in her car seat and runs inside to fetch said picture.In less than a minute, when Nick runs back outside, Ellis is nowhere to be seen. Gone without a trace. He knows that she didn't just wander off ... someone took her, but who, why?As the police are looking closer and closer at Nick, he receives an email. \"They\" have Ellie and if he wants her back alive, he must kill his wife. He and he alone must make a decision that will most certainly cause a death .. but what will he choose?Is it right to take a life in order to save a life? What if the lives are your wife .. whom you no longer love ... or your daughter, who you love with all your heart?What a great story premise! It's full of tension and suspense. The chapters alternate between Nick and Tasha's voices. Suspicion starts creeping in as Tasha learns about her husband's years-old secret. The police are questioning Nick's every move. The threads holding them together slowly start unraveling. And where is Tasha?This is a well-written psychological look at what happens when a child is kidnapped and the ransom demand is non-negotiable. This was my first book I've read by this author and eagerly look forward to reading more.I gave it 5 stars ... the story was riveting and kept me engaged from the very beginning to the very end.. and the ending was totally unexpected.Many thanks to the author / Thomas & Mercer / Netgalley who provided an advance copy of HER LAST TOMORROW."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13487611-lee", "userReview": "Wow this is a very unusual theme for a book and I loved it. Nick Connor is facing some severe trouble. Someone has kidnapped his daughter, five year old Ellie and he is told the only way to get her back is to kill his wife. This makes for a very exciting, gripping and suspenseful story. Could you murder your partner to save your child?, this is the awful situation Nick finds himself in.

It appeared so often on my Facebook feed that I felt I ought to read it. I liked that it was a Harlan Coben/Linwood Barclay style psychological thriller but set in England. It is easily the worst book I have read in a long time. No character development, ridiculous plot. Thankfully it is very short so the time I wasted hoping it would improve wasn't a huge chunk out of my life. I keep reading that it is almost impossible to get published without connections, even if your book is great.

As a parent we would do anything for our children, but to kill for them, and not just anyone either. Could you honestly kill the person you married and chose to spend the rest of your life with? I have to admit I just don't know if I could do it and I pray that I never find myself in the same position as Nick does in this book.I was well and truly gripped by this story and I flew through it within no time as I literally could not put it down. I felt so sorry for Nick, when he realises his daughter is missing, I could feel my heart racing as I could very much feel the panic building inside of him. Her Last Tomorrow certainly makes for a very tense reading experience. It's a novel that will certainly have the reader questioning themselves as to what they would do in the same position.

The writing is not complicated, the book is not long, and the chapters are short. Sometimes books that shift perspectives can be confusing, but because this one only alternates between Nick and Tasha with few other characters to muddle it, it's smooth sailing all the way through. I enjoyed it as a quick read on the night of our very first snow this season and was quite satisfied. Could you kill your spouse to save your daughter? What if you don't feel like you even like your the woman you married anymore, let alone love her? We start with a fairly typical morning in the household shared by Nick, Tasha, and five year old Ellie. Ridiculously, Tasha makes Nick and Ellie get up far earlier than they have to. She has to leave for work before they do, and she thinks that's the only way to make sure Nick manages to get her to school on time. Of course, he falls back asleep while he waits and they're going to be late anyway. Ellie demands a drawing she forgot in the house once she's buckled into her carseat. Already running behind but trying to avoid a tantrum, Nick runs back inside the house to grab it. He's only gone for a minute, but Ellie is gone when he returns. Panic ensues. Hopes that she's just wandered off are soon dashed as the hours pass. Someone has to have her. Her little five year old legs couldn't have carried her far enough to keep her so hidden on her own, alluding the police searching her. Nick soon finds that his suspicions are correct when he receives a chilling email. He's told he must kill his wife if he wants to see his daughter again and not to alert the police. Is he capable of murder? Could he hire someone to do it for him? Or risk telling the police? With no idea who would take his child and want his wife dead, he must decide. I thought the ending was a bit rushed. I think it could have been fleshed out a bit. I still think it was an enjoyable read and would recommend it. What a chilling premise!I received this book from Net Galley and Thomas & Mercer, thank you!

Nick is a writer, struggling to make his next release a success and in a slowly dwindling marriage. His greatest love is his five year old daughter. So when she disappears, his world is shattered as the finger of suspicion is placed firmly in his direction. Even his own wife starts to doubt him. I thought the writing of this book was easily to digest and it\u2019s short, sharp chapters made for comfortable reading. I liked the alternate narrators too. The story had a few red herrings thrown about, which is a must within this genre and kept me guessing. The pace of the book is satisfactory enough. One thing I found odd is how the police respond to the report of a missing child - we have seen time and time again that in real life cases if a child isn\u2019t found within a few hours it makes national news. This wasn\u2019t reflected in the story and suggested a slight lack of research on the authors part.Although the books climax wasn\u2019t earth shattering, I enjoyed it overall and would probably read this author again.

I think it must have been given a little bit of a mini makeover by the publisher as it seems a bit more polished now compared to the reviews from when it was first self published. The plot and general idea of this book is actually rather intriguing. And, on the whole, I did really enjoy this book. Adam Croft has an assured writing style that gradually gets under your skin as he weaves his twisted way through this terrible tragedy for Nick and Tasha. Their 5 year old daughter, Ellie, has been kidnapped from the car outside her own home while Nick has popped back into the house just before the school run. Nick is then approached by the kidnappers in an e-mail saying that he can get Ellie back but to do so....he must kill his wife. Now, of course Nick doesn't go to the police but rather shockingly, murdering Tasha doesn't seem such an abhorrent idea to him as it did it me! The question is, how far will Nick go to get his daughter home?The main problem I had with this book was that nobody really seemed that bothered about Ellie being missing! Nick and Tasha appeared to go about their usual lives and there was no screaming or crying from them, just a very unemotional working through of a hiccup in their lives! I found it very bizarre! And the police kind of popped in and out but again there was no feeling of emergency in their responses. Where was their support, their family liaison officer, the press? I just struggled to connect with their lack of urgency especially as the days passed.Her Last Tomorrow did tick a lot of boxes for me but unfortunately believable plotlines wasn't one of them. There is no doubt though that Adam Croft is a talented storyteller and an even more talented publicist to get such a buzz going about this book-it has a HUGE amount of reviews over on Amazon. I will definitely be keeping a look out for further books penned by the author, especially in this genre as there is definitely something there that I'm happy to explore further."}, {"userName": "Sharon Haigh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43593953-sharon-haigh", "userReview": "I loved this book.

Whether or not two such deeply unlikable people should be allowed to breed is one question. There seems to be a glut of these stories lately. People with parenting skills on a par with Kate and Gerry McCann who deliberately leave their precious child in a dangerous situation then get all surprised and hand wringy when the poor child goes missing as a direct result of their negligence. Plot fails early on one major point, related to emails. I'm not going to spoil it by telling why. Irritating, frequent, computer snob type promotional paragraphs for Mac.

For even though the former may have done some deeply questionable things and may be self destructive or even downright villainous, they still manage to incite empathy from the reader. If the way a character is created stops you from feeling any empathy for them, then ultimately, the book has failed in its purpose because no matter what happens to them, no one reading will give a damn.The two main characters definitely fell upon the side of dislikable, although admittedly Nick was far more so than Tasha, and it got to the point where I cringed at the thought of turning the page and hearing more of what they had to say. Both of them are ignorant, selfish, self-absorbed and honestly I have no idea why they were so desperate to have a baby because they treat her (and her disappearance) as a minor inconvenience to their oh-so-important lives.In addition to the parents' appalling characterisation, I feel as though we didn't have enough time with their child to really care enough about her going missing. Honestly, I kind of hope that a lovely family drove passed and saw how shit her parents were and decided to save her from them. As far as I can tell, the only reason why they seem to care about their child is so that they can rub it in their partner's face that they love her more. And don't even get me started on the whole ransom email thing.My patience has been seriously cut short over the past few days when it comes to shitty literature and I mean, I could stick with this book for another 200 pages to say that I gave it a fair chance but honestly, I'd much rather stick pins in my eyes.Head on over to http://bit.ly/2y7JSWV for this book, as well as all of the others featured in my reviews, complete with the added bonuses of free worldwide shipping and bringing a little joy to my life."}, {"userName": "Zoe Hall", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34708201-zoe-hall", "userReview": "I read this book on a whim as I'd seen it advertised and it was also recommended to me.

One minute your daughter's missing, the next minute you're plotting to kill your wife, the next minute you've worked out who the kidnapper is. Then that's it, the story is over. The writing is easy to follow, but I've read many books that do this kind of plot much better, which is a shame as I had high hopes for this book. Massively disappointed with the culprit, who was not even a pivotal character in the book. They needed to be introduced earlier on for it to be believable in my opinion.Not bad, but not the best thriller I've read.

But soon his murky past will collide with his idyllic life and threaten the very people he loves the most in the world. When his five-year-old daughter, Ellie, is kidnapped, Nick's life is thrown into a tailspin. In exchange for his daughter's safe return, Nick will have to do the unthinkable: he must murder his wife.
