WildMatt MooreEric J. GuignardPatty TempletonEagerly, I began to read the 1st of the 22 stories in this over 500-page volume published by Blood Bound Books. \u201cAhhhh, this is exactly what I need,\u201d I thought to myself as \u2018The Run\u2019 by Aric Sundquist enveloped me. And it happened just that way, again and again, each time I set my daily work aside and returned to the pages of \u2018Night Terrors III\u2019.Highlights? Well, there wasn\u2019t a clinker in the lot, but a few that resonated particularly for me were the aforementioned \u2018The Run\u2019, \u2018Homeless Bags\u2019 by Dean H. Wild, \u2018Tyger\u2019 by Steve Rasnic Tem (already a huge fan of his work, I just started his latest novel, \u2018Blood Kin\u2019 \u2013so far I\u2019m enthralled), \u2018You\u2019re a Winner\u2019 by Matt Moore, \u2018Whispers of the Earth\u2019 by Eric J. Guigard, \u2018Kill-Box Road Trip\u2019 by Patty Templeton, and \u2018Fed\u2019 by Jessica Lilien. But, like I said, each tale in this collection is a gem. You can\u2019t go wrong.I\u2019ll be visiting these pages again.Do yourself a favor.This one satisfies.This one scratches that itch."}, {"userName": "Lilyn G. | Sci-Fi & Scary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33783014-lilyn-g-sci-fi-scary", "userReview": "You can find this full review and many others at Scifi and Scary's Book Reviews.Night Terrors III, which I received via publisher outreach after reviewing Prince of Nightmares , was one of the best anthologies I\u2019ve read. The great definitely outweighed the mediocre, and there were only a couple stinkers in the bunch. The only thing that kept this from receiving a top rating from me was that the last few stories were unfortunately not that great, so the book felt like it ended with some of its weakest work instead of ending on a strong point.Like I\u2019ve done with anthologies in the past, I\u2019ve left my notes so you can see specifically what I rated/thought of each story. The Run by Aric Sundquist \u2013 4/5 \u2013 Twisted, interesting, but not memoriable.Homeless Bags by Dean H Wild \u2013 5/5 \u2013 with a healthy heap of \u201cWelp, I\u2019m never looking at my luggage the same way again, and oh please God let me never get stuck in an airport during the storm. This was a downright creepy read!Listen by Jack Ketchum \u2013 3/5 \u2013 It definitely wasn\u2019t what you expected, and there were two unique twists in it, but I just wasn\u2019t fond of that particular writing style and didn\u2019t care overmuch for the story.Man Holding Razer Blade by John McNee \u2013 5/5 \u2013 Definitely see McNee\u2019s style. A twisted read that wraps up fantastically.Sailor\u2019s Rest by Jay Caselberg \u2013 3/5- This wasn\u2019t a bad story, persay, but it seems almost out of place with the tone and depth of the other stories.The Dead Boy by Paul Tremblay \u2013 no rating \u2013 did not read. Skipped as soon as it became apparent that it was going to in depth about a dead child. Didn\u2019t need those triggers hit.Home Care by Kevin David Anderson \u2013 2/5- cliche and uninteresting.Tyger by Steve Rasnic Tem \u2013 4/5 \u2013 An angry, darker version of Calvin and HobbesPandoras Children by Simon McCaffrey \u2013 5/5 \u2013 Oooh, this is interesting, and I want to read an expanded version of it! All demons and aliens and scientific racing and\u2026boom.You\u2019re a Winner! by Matt Moore -3/5 \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about this tale of someone going crazy(er).The Deer Chaser by Rachel Nussbaum \u2013 5/5 \u2013 This was an excellent entry into the rumored monsters category. Truly a delight to read.The Stones of Bavdongarde by Peter Charron- 5/5 \u2013 Great classic monster fic!The Love of A Troll on a Mid-Winter\u2019s Night by Jennifer Brozek \u2013 4/5 \u2013 This was interesting and a bit off-beat. The ending made me pause for a minute, and then go \u201cOoooh. Gotcha!\u201d Stomach \u201cBug\u201d. Hahaha!Show and Tell by Taylor Grant \u2013 4/5 \u2013 Kooky, but fun. One of the \u201cTales from the Crypt\u201d style tales that falls just a tad bit short of the mark.Whispers of the Earth by Eric. J. Guignard \u2013 4/5 \u2013 Decent story, good premise, but could have had a stronger ending.The Next in Line by Richard Farren Barber \u2013 4/5 \u2013 For the type of story its meant to be, its pretty good. Peer tales are powerful things to an impressionable mind.White Moon Rising by Dennis Etchison \u2013 2/5 \u2013 Not a fan. Beyond random spacing issues, it was too disjointed and just not that interesting.Of the Color Turmeric, Climbing on Fingertips by Gerry Huntman \u2013 4/5 \u2013 Good creep, good gore. Utterly implausible, but still interesting!Kill-Box Road Trip by Patty Templeton \u2013 5/5 Great read. Reminded me of a snarkier, darker BtVS with a twist of originality. Loved the Pandora\u2019s Box reference.Falco Wreck by Raymon Little \u2013 3/5 \u2013 Good story, but something about it just seemed unoriginal enough that I couldn\u2019t be interested in it.Dreams in a Pink Light District by Kyle S. Johnson \u2013 2/5 \u2026.what? Maybe I entirely missed something vital, but this just seemed confusing and not-interesting.Fed by Jessica Lilien \u2013 3/5 \u2013 Seemingly a possible tale about PPD. Not enough to this for it to be good. Felt like it was ended where it was just for the sake of ending it instead of it being a natural conclusion to the story.Overall, the editor did a good job putting this collection together, and I can honestly say I\u2019d willingly pick up the other books in this series. I never thought I\u2019d say that about an anthology!Disclaimer: Received a copy free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Elisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24746698-elisa", "userReview": "I received a free copy from the Publisher in exchange for an honest review. Thank you, Blood Bound Books!I always start my reviews of short story collections with the disclaimer that most tend to be uneven, especially when they include many different authors. Night Terrors III does include a few tales that I didn't understand (and therefore, did not enjoy), but the big majority of the book is five-star material. If you sent a troll to threaten me to choose my favorite or else he'd open Pandora's box, I guess I\u2019d bring all the ills back into the world, as I just can\u2019t do it. Of The Color Turmeric, Climbing on Fingertips was a favorite. Written by Gerry Huntman, an Australian author of speculative fiction, it will give me nightmares. Fed, by Jessica Lilien, should not be read by any woman who is planning to become a mother. Ever. The Stone of Bavdongarde by Peter Charron is set in the Second World War and accomplishes the impressive task of making the Nazis be the lesser of two evils. Even Richard Farren Barber's The Next in Line, with all the simplicity of the most basic childhood terrors, made my skin crawl. But really, I would have to list all the stories if I wanted to talk about my favorites. For horror aficionados, this is a wonderful, scary, addictive book."}, {"userName": "Veronica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25954528-veronica", "userReview": "All I can say is wow! Writing short stories is not easy to do but each one of these wonderful stories are original and well thought out. I do have some favorites and one or two that I was not keen on but that is normal and due to personal preference. All in all, this is a very addictive and stay up late at night reading kind of horror anthology. The best part is that some of the authors are new to me and there is a wonderful introduction for each of them. The stories range from pure horror to supernatural to just plain weird. It is a great read for lovers of Horror Fiction."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9439088-wanda", "userReview": "Not the Best, But...It's a bit more difficult to review an anthology than a novel; I always have to guard against rating it based on the last story read!This collection was fairly good. Fewer stories made me grimace than made me smile, and fewer still made me want to put the book down.There were one or two that I was quite tempted to skip, but I made it through them all. All in all, it turned out to be better than I expected, a book I could read anytime, not just read to kill time in the bathroom."}, {"userName": "Kevin Maring", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3874646-kevin-maring", "userReview": "I got this as a freeby; Mister Tem is an excellent editor who is able to put together a balanced and entertaining blend of authors.
