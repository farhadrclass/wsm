Sadly the few books written by Miss Colleen that I've read haven't been my style. Although I like a good mystery, I really dislike violence, and her books have too much violence for my tastes. In addition to human/human violence, there was also animal/human violence. There were several other things I disliked, including the fact that some of the comments regarding bears seemed ill-researched and therefore took me out of the story and made it feel unbelievable to me. The plot was interesting, and the main characters were complex and grew during the story, but overall this book really wasn't one I liked."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2511537-barbara", "userReview": "I struggled a little bit rating this one. It held my interest, I enjoyed it, and I loved the mix of mystery and romance. There were simply several times during the course of the book that I found something a little hard to fully believe, so I considered rating it a three, but entertainment value won out and I went with a four. The author does a very good job making the reader feel they are actually experiencing the Alaskan wilderness, and I enjoyed the characters of Haley, Brooke, and Tank. If you want an intense mystery with some sweet parts mixed in, I would recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721595-melissa", "userReview": "2.5 stars--Christian romantic suspense--Woman goes to Alaska to photograph a guy who deals with bears, finds out something about parents who were killed.

That's how I describe my attitude through the entirety of this book. I can't really blame the author; freelance writers tend to be of an, er, lesser quality. The usage of Christianity felt forced, the relationships were very superficial, the dialogue was synonymous with a 14 year olds creative writing assignment.

When Haley Walsh returns to Stalwart, Alaska, a small community with big secrets, more threats than just painful memories are lying in wait. On assignment to document a celebrity wildlife expert's interaction with bears in the wild, she also plans to seek out the truth about the suspicious death of her parents. Grudgingly along on the expedition is Tank Lassiter, a local biologist who has no choice but to lead the group through the rugged Alaska territory. Years before, as a young girl, Haley had lost part of one leg in a mine cave-in which took the life of her sister. Her parents blamed Haley for her sister's death and sent her away to live with her grandmother. Haley doesn't let the partial loss of a limb slow her down, but she does have emotional issues. Tank Lassiter's wife died in a strange drowning accident, and he is very protective of his little girl. He prefers a life away from civilization and uncivilized city folk. He and Haley don't always see eye to eye, but they like what they see when they look at each other. Will the strength of their growing love overcome the challenge of their very different lives? Mysteries abound, and each day brings a new adventure in this modern-day Alaska frontier romantic tale. If you like to step outside your reading box and look for love stories in beautiful settings with a different story line, then you will enjoy \"Alaska Twilight\"!"}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16793358-deborah", "userReview": "Haley Mitchell is a photographer that is given the rare opportunity to document biologist Tank Lassiter's work with bears in Alaska. She loves the beauty of the wilderness, but knows how deadly it can really be. Haley struggles with trying to find clues to the mystery of her past, but is strangely drawn to the wilderness - and Tank. Haley is in Alaska for reasons of her own, and so is Tank. He could never imagine living anywhere but Alaska, and with a little girl to raise on his own, he couldn't choose a better place for her to grow up. But when a human death is blamed on one of his grizzlies, Tank is racing against the clock to prove otherwise. Will Tank and Haley find answers in their quests for the truth?Coble paints some very beautiful word pictures in this novel; scenes of the great Alaskan wilderness and the deadly beauty it offers. While the romantic interests of the characters is the typical song and dance we are getting from almost any Christian romantic novel, this story line is interesting and fresh despite the anticipated outcome. A little bit of mystery and suspense was thrown into the novel, and that kept it fresh and intriguing. A solid read and a good mystery besides."}, {"userName": "JoAnne", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17879047-joanne", "userReview": "This book has a pretty heavy Christian message.

I lumbered through the middle to see the semi-okay romance develop. But by the end, just when I thought the suspense might make the story better, it got so far-fetched that I was groaning in misery. WAY too many coincidences and just too predictable throughout. The last few chapters really just became laughable they were so ridiculous.Probably deserves one star, but I usually reserve that for books I can't stand to even finish.Oh, and I have a life-long fear of bears, but this book about the importance of bear preservation did absolutely nothing to ease that fear.
