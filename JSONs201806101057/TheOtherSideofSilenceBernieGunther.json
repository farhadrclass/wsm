Our sardonic, cynic hero (and closet romantic) is Bernie Gunther, whose exploits as a Berlin homicide detective and reluctant participant in various SS schemes during World War 2 are featured in previous entries in this series, is trying to live a quiet life as the concierge of a fancy hotel in Cap Ferrat, a peninsula between Nice and Monaco. Playing bridge is the highest level of excitement he craves. But all that changes when the town\u2019s most famous resident, Maugham, now age 82, invites him to a bridge game and then presses him to serve as an intermediary in blackmail negotiations over some damaging photos of a naked pool party at his villa from just before the war. The infamous spy, Guy Burgess, is featured in the photos, a former MI6 and KGB double agent who did propaganda with BBC during the war and later served in sensitive sites with the Foreign Office before defecting to Russia in 1951. That Maugham served a long time with MI6, starting with running a network of agents in Petrograd in World War 1, the exposure would put him under suspicions.It turns out that a particular nemesis of Bernie\u2019s, Otto Hebel, is a key player in the threat, a former SS officer who caused him great personal pain and loss with blackmail schemes during the war and now serves with the brutal security force of East Germany, the Stasi. Bernie is particularly vulnerable because he is tainted with his collusion with famous war criminals of the Nazi regime and is living under false name, using papers ironically procured for him as part a deal with another former Nazi, now the current head of the Stasi. When the blackmail escalates to a larger threat to undermine confidence in British intelligence services, right when trust among its allies was critical for teamwork on dealing with the Suez Canal crisis, a lot of their spymasters show up in town with aggressive doubts about Bernie\u2019s role. So you can see Bernie is between a rock and a hard place. The challenge of surviving this nexus of dangerous forces actually has the effect of stirring Bernie out of a suicidal depression. Instead of running, he can\u2019t resist acting from his growing friendship with Maugham and doing his best for a man who has a similar combination of cynical outlook and viciously playful humor. Bernie is also wakened to supreme craftiness by the murder of a friend and his deep desire to stay in Cap Ferrat due to a love relationship that blossoms with a woman working on a biography of Maugham. Though he has sworn off killing enemies, he has to find a way to achieve vengeance against Hebel, who in a long flashback to his time in Konigsberg, East Prussia, in 1945 features a suspected role for the SS agent\u2019s greed in mistakes that led to the Russian topedo sinking of an evacuation ship, the Wilhelm Gustloff, with the loss of 9,000 civilians (a real event that still stands as the largest maritime death toll in history). The blend of historical fact and figures with an intricate and plausible espionage yarn makes this a fun ride. The attempt to portray Maugham\u2019s personality and details of his lifestyle at his fabulous Villa Mauresque made for an extra treat. Here is a sample of some of the banter there:A Brit asks Bernie:Do you think he could be a Russian agent? He wouldn't be the first communist to own a fucking Picasso.\"\"Including Picasso\".A point where Bernie notices a the Gauguin's painting of a Tahitian woman has seven toes brings up some of Maugham's misogyny:\"You know why I bought her? To remind me how ugly I find women. ...\"I looked at the picture and nodded. \"She's not my type ...That's why high heels were invented, isn't it? To stop women looking like us.\"\"And you wonder why your relationships go wrong? Take it from Gauguin. You can't trust Western ideals of beauty ...Every angel is really a devil. And every woman is a whore.\"\"Not every woman. Only the ones who ask for money.\"And here we get Bernie's response to Maugham's comment the \"Love is just a dirty trick that\u2019s played on us to achieve continuation of the species.\": Love and hate, human feelings and emotion, they\u2019re all the same God-given illusion. It\u2019s what convinces us that we\u2019re here and that we count for something in this universe. When we don\u2019t. Not for a second. Everything we feel and that we think\u2014it\u2019s all the same cosmic joke. You should know that more than most people, Mr. Maugham. You\u2019ve been playing God and inflicting cosmic jokes on your characters for sixty years.The book was provided by the publisher for review through the Netgalley program and is due out on March 29th."}, {"userName": "Nikos Tsentemeidis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27325053-nikos-tsentemeidis", "userReview":

I do not read many thrillers, but will always read a Bernie Gunther. They are well researched, full of real historical persons and you get treated to truly witty wise-cracks, so what else would you wish for in a historical thriller. Contrary to the other Bernie thrillers, which can move through the 1930th, '40th and halfway '50th in one story, it is the first one which had only one flashback to Bernie's life in Nazi Germany and in particular the timeframe when the Russians are approaching at the beginning of 1945. For the rest, the entire story of the book is set at the Cote d'Azur in 1956. As usual, Bernie's past is catching up on him in the person of a former SS officer who caused Bernie much harm in the war. The story evolves around Somerset Maugham. I always enjoy how Philip Kerr chooses his main characters for his Bernie books. Who would ever thought Bernie would be a house guest of Somerset Maugham! Maugham is a very enjoyable persona, a splendid man in a splendid mansion, delivering his devious views on mankind in a constant flow of words. There are some very excentric officers of MI5 and MI6 to enjoy as well. Bernie survives, but barely, as he always does. He is not getting any younger and is more weary in this novel, but another Bernie novel has been announced, so I am confident he will be forced into trouble again. I will patiently await his further exploits."}, {"userName": "Tom Mathews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews", "userReview": "Readers who aren\u2019t familiar with Bernie Gunther have missed out on a classically cynical detective living in a time and place where there is much to be cynical about. Those who have read Philip Kerr\u2019s engaging series know that, if nothing else, Gunther has served as an engaging tour guide to life in Germany during the years that the Nazi party was in power. In this eleventh book in the series, one war is over and another, colder war has begun. Kerr\u2019s Berlin gumshoe is in hiding, changing his name and career. Life is hard when you are forced to hide out on the French Riviera, working as concierge at a hotel for the soon-to-be-called jet set. Try as he might, though, trouble soon finds Bernie. British author and former intelligence operative W. Somerset Maugham, living nearby is being blackmailed and wants Gunther to coordinate the payoff. This brings him into contact with an old nemesis, Harold Henning, with whom he has crossed paths before with tragic consequences. From there, the story evolves into a twisted tale of Byzantine spycraft, involving acronymous agencies from multiple countries. Gunther, ever the rogue agent, is deeply in trouble and has to rely on all of his skills to make it to the end alive. It might be wise to wear a neck brace when reading this book. I\u2019m still not sure if this is a story of double agents, triple agents, quadruple agents, or something even more Machiavellian. Bottom line, I loved it. Be advised, this book is part of a series that does have a significant back story with recurring characters. For this reason I assigned this a series rating of 3.5* and recommend you consider starting the series at the beginning. Bernie Gunther first appears in the Berlin Noir: March Violets / The Pale Criminal / A German Requiem trilogy. *[Some people insist on reading series in order starting at the beginning. I believe that this is absolutely necessary with some series and unnecessary in others. In my reviews I assign books in a series a score of one to five in which the higher score denotes increased importance of reading the book in order. A series with returning villains, an ongoing story arc, and evolving family dynamics will rate higher than one where the plot in each book is totally unrelated to the others. As an example, a Nancy Drew book would be a one. There is no evolving story arc. Nancy hasn\u2019t grown any older in fifty years and, face it, Ned is never going to propose to her. The Lord of the Rings, on the other hand, is a five. Reading the trilogy in order is essential to fully understanding and appreciating the story. One book picks up right where its predecessor leaves off and Fellowship of the Ring contains information that readers of The Two Towers really need to know. Besides, Tolkien originally wrote it as a single volume.]** review was based on an advanced reading copy obtained at no cost from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review. While this does take any \u2018not worth what I paid for it\u2019 statements out of my review, it otherwise has no impact on the content of my review.FYI: On a 5-point scale I assign stars based on my assessment of what the book needs in the way of improvements:-5 Stars \u2013 Nothing at all. If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.-4 Stars \u2013 It could stand for a few tweaks here and there but it\u2019s pretty good as it is.-3 Stars \u2013 A solid C grade. Some serious rewriting would be needed in order for this book to be considered great or memorable.-2 Stars \u2013 This book needs a lot of work. A good start would be to change the plot, the character development, the writing style and the ending. -1 Star - The only thing that would improve this book is a good bonfire."}, {"userName": "Chrissa Vasileiou", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18434544-chrissa-vasileiou", "userReview": "\u0397 \u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf site \"Book City\": \u0397 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b9\u03c9\u03c0\u03ae\u03c2"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "I love books and there are many series that I follow, but I think that Bernie Gunther is possibly my favourite fictional character \u2013 so a new Gunther novel is a reading highlight for me. This is a series I have read, and re-read, a lot over the years and I am delighted to say that this is one of my favourite books so far.As always, we jump around in Bernie\u2019s life and, in this novel, it is 1956 and he is living on the French Riviera. Pushing sixty, working as a concierge at the Grand Hotel de Saint-Jean, he is nestled between Nice and Monaco and living under the assumed name of Walter Wolf. It is not an exciting life and he has taken up bridge to help stave off the thoughts of suicide that plague him, especially at night. For, with Bernie, his history is always pressing on him and those memories just never leave him alone\u2026Of course, many Germans must have been living under false passports at that time and Bernie\u2019s was given to him by the deputy head of the Stasi. However, when a guest checks in under the name Harold Heinz Hebel, Bernie immediately recognises him as Harold Hennig \u2013 fomer Captain in the SD and a known blackmailer. Indeed, blackmail is central to this novel, as Bernie is introduced to the author, W. Somerset Maugham, who asks Bernie (or Mr Wolf\u2026) for help as he is being blackmailed himself.In this novel, we will travel back to 1938 and 1945 as well as an exciting and involved story set firmly in 1956. The author invokes the world of W. Somerset Maugham (also a favourite author of mine) wonderfully well. This storyline also involves the Cambridge spy ring and we have the involvement of Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt. Kerr juggles the different threads so well, including a side story involving the theme of playing bridge, plus the beautiful Anne French, who is pressing Bernie to introduce her to Maugham, as she wants to write a biography of the reclusive writers life.Although saddened to reach the end of this novel, I was thrilled to read that there will be another in the series, planned for next year. I look forward to meeting up with Bernie Gunther once again and reading more of his adventures. Wry, clever, pragmatic, intelligent and resourceful \u2013 I hope that, wherever and whenever, we meet him again that he will continue to thrill his many followers."}, {"userName": "Maria Bikaki", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16500960-maria-bikaki", "userReview": "\u0397 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u039c\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9. \u039b\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf \u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03c1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ad\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1, \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac \u03b7 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1\u03b6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0393\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7\u03b8\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03b4\u03ad\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1. \u0388\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03be\u03b5\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03ce \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ad\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b2\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7. \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf, \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf, \u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0 \u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03c1. \u0388\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03be\u03b5\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9. \u0395\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2."}, {"userName": "Judy Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4814399-judy-lesley", "userReview": "For readers who anxiously await each new installment in the Bernie Gunther series, grab some quiet time and just start reading this one, but have your seatbelt buckled because you are going on a corkscrew twisty ride. Readers new to the series can certainly begin here, I'm not going to tell you not to, but you need to understand that Bernie has a huge amount of backstory and this author loves to bring back characters from several books back and it might get a little confusing. In this story Bernie is really, really bored. So bored with his life that he goes so far as to try to end it. I say he couldn't have been very serious in the first place to have failed so completely. However, that was good news for me - and you.Imagine living on the French Riviera and being bored. Most of us would have a hard time contemplating that but then Bernie has lived a life chock full of life threatening and death defying experiences so he doesn't look at things the same way you or I might. He's is his position as concierge of the Grand Hotel du Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, it's 1956, he's changed his name to Walter Wolf, nobody knows about his past in Germany during World War II, he has found a regular group to play bridge with, all is not well but he's getting along. Then, looking across the hotel lobby he spots someone from his past and everything changes in the blink of an eye. That's the last time you will ever be completely certain in this novel that there isn't another plot twist waiting in the next paragraph.Filled with absolutely fascinating information concerning the British Intelligence community during World War II and how they interacted with first the Germans and now (in 1956) with the Russians - with the Americans lurking on the periphery - this novel is almost a history lesson of how these systems came to impact the war. Secrets don't remain secret because someone always has access to the information to use as blackmail against a target to make them do exactly what you want. Somerset Maugham and his nephew Robin play a large role in this story along with other true historical figures from the times. The double crosses come at a race-track-fast rate. Bernie is even more moody and depressed in this novel than in others. Maybe he will learn at some point to stay clear of the type of woman he gravitates toward? There is a murder which Bernie solves almost in an off-hand manner without having the criminal brought to justice. Later in the novel he explains his thinking of the difference between revenge and vengeance and that's all it took for me to cheer Bernie's decision at the conclusion of the novel.The feeling of being in this place at this time is wonderfully shored up with mentions of Bernie seeing the yacht of Aristotle Onassis moored in the harbor. Somerset Maugham receives an invitation to the wedding of Prince Rainier and Grace Kelly in Monaco. All kinds of neat little tidbits are scattered throughout the book to place you firmly in the location and the time frame. Positively recommended for readers who want to know more about World War II from the viewpoint of those who did the day-to-day dirty work for their respective governments. Plus, it just happens to be a darn good reading experience too.I received this novel through the Amazon Vine Voices program, NetGalley and Penguin Group."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark", "userReview": "Another tale from the Bernie Gunther adventures and as his author writes them in no chronological order this one takes place in 1956 in the South of France. Bernie is a concierge in a French Hotel, made me watch Richard E Grants \"hotel secrets\" episode about the fantastic hotels in the South of France, to give me a feeling for the surroundings.Bernie gets invited by the great W. Somerset Maugham and gets thrown into his world because the great writer gets blackmailed by a Nazi that twice made a damaging impression or trespass in Gunthers life. That said we get two stories of Gunthers experiences with this man that are moments from a Nazi Germany that give new insight for people into matters of WWII that are generally not that well known. This time the man has decided to blackmail the writers private life which involves a lot of his homosexual lifestyle which was not accepted in those days and could still get you landed in jail or worse. How many homosexuals did die in the Nazi concentration camps?- Like a lot of groups in Germany and occupied territories that were not considered the moral norm they were gathered and slaughtered or used as a working force. Gunther gets involved in the murky world of spies this time as well and his role is the one of sacrificial lamb which he has no clue of until it is way to late. Bernie has got himself tangled into the Cambridge spy-ring and the games spies seem to be up to.Will Bernie's survivor skills get him through this adventure when it seems that his wartime history will not leave him in peace.Another great tale of postwar Europe in which we can feel the cold war becoming more of a reality and a Europe only a decade away from a devastating war. A well written period piece and a splendid story about Bernie Gunther. looking forward to the next installment: Prussian Blue.

An unpleasant blackmailer named Harold Heinz Hebel, who Bernie encountered back in 1938, and then during the winter of 1944/45, who we learn about in flashback, is the catalyst for another absorbing and surprising tale. The present day narrative takes place in 1956 with Bernie working at a hotel on the French Riviera. Bernie\u2019s involvement in the blackmail case continues his dark, brooding character development. Pushing 60 years of age he already considers himself a dead man. His dark philosophising is truly the stuff of legend. Can it get any worse? Oh yes. Even when you\u2019re down there\u2019s the chance of a few more painful kicks. There are rich rewards for anyone who follows Bernie through this series and these continue in 'The Other Side of Silence\u2019. This time out it's Burgess and Maclean, or at least a tape of Burgess talking to KGB officers which incriminate W. Somerset Maugham and, more significantly, the British intelligence services. Bernie's interactions with Maugham are one of the many pleasures of this novel.Wonderful, as always.

This is the first book I have read of the series and it works as a standalone. We encounter Gunther trying to commit suicide but thankfully failing. His wife has left him to return home. Gunther finds himself helping W. Somerset Maugham, a writer and one time spy, who is being blackmailed by an old and loathed foe of Gunther, Harold Henning. He has a photograph which has Maugham with Guy Burgess, and others in compromising acts in a gay sex orgy party. However, nothing and no-one is as they seem. The blackmail plot turns out to be more complex and far reaching than first envisaged, there is a bigger target than just Maugham. It appears that the British Intelligence Services would prefer not to have their gross incompetence aired in public and more specifically to the Americans. There are tapes which suggest there are a greater number of traitors who are leaking state secrets to Russia. Gunther's bridge partner is murdered and he begins a sexual relationship with Anne French. French is writing a biography of Maugham and wants Gunther to get her access to the notoriously reclusive Maugham. In a tale littered with heightened tension, Gunther discovers that he does want to live and draws on his phenomenal gift for getting out of exceedingly tight corners and handling the deepest betrayals.Philip Kerr has an unerring eye for this historical period, like the Cambridge Spy Ring and British Intelligence and its failures, to spin a superb atmospheric Cold War tale of spies and intrigue. The piece de resistance is the cynical and world weary Gunther. His dark humour and history make him at ease with dealing with Maugham and the grim world he lives in. This twisted and beguiling tale located in actual history and real characters is superb and has the feel of credible authenticity. A memorable and compelling read which i recommend to others.

No longer. The Other Side of Silence is the 11th novel of Philip Kerr\u2019s Bernie Gunther series. I was quite disappointed. The cynical attitude and dark wit is sadly weak or missing. In his earlier books, when Philip Kerr was writing about the horror of life under the Nazis, he excelled. But he has lost his touch. Having read, many years ago, the major novels and most of the short stories of W. Somerset Maugham, I was initially intrigued by his life and his life style. I had no idea and knew little about Maugham. It is not that I am going to give up on Philip Kerr and I will likely try his next novel Prussian Blue. I will give The Other Side of Silence 2 stars primarily because of what I learned about Maugham, not because of the convoluted plot surrounding British Intelligence.

The writing is topnotch, even better than usual, and the heavily ironic Berlin-style humor is hot and heavy coming out of Bernie's mouth. If you've read all his previous misadventures, then you understand how he got so jaded and depressed. He has every right to feel that way. In fact, in the early pages of this book, he even recounts that he tried suicide. How he is still standing beats me...and I fear for his future--I am afraid he will end soon. He is in his early sixties in this book, set in 1956 in the French Riviera. While some reviewers didn't like the absence of Hitler-era detail, I loved how the brilliant, well-researched author Philip Kerr shows the aftermath of the Nazi regime. Bernie is a former Berlin policeman who was used by the Nazis and pressed into doing their bidding, flung into the gulag by the Soviets after World War II, and escaped with the aid of a sinister old acquaintance (who becomes the real-life East German head of the Stasi, Erich Mielke. Find his photo on Wikipedia.com and shiver from the evil shooting out his eyes at you, not kidding). In this book Bernie \"hides out\" as a concierge at a swish French hotel, tangles with famed British author Somerset Maugham, and runs into Cold War spies from both sides, getting squished in the middle. Of course there is his usual dalliance with a femme fatale--one who may or may not be just what she seems. If I could give this book more stars, then I surely would. And I do not even like noir as a rule, and this historical thriller reeks of it...it is world-weary and wonderfully well done. There is a phrase \"Prussian blue\" worked into the conclusion, and after that, the end papers note to readers says that the next Bernie Gunther book is called PRUSSIAN BLUE and publishes in 2017. I believe the text gives us a tiny hint of what we can expect, and as usual, I suspect it will not be pretty. Poor, sad Bernie Gunther.

Almost every building to the south of Adolf-Hitler-Platz, including the famous castle and the cathedral where Kant was buried, were destroyed or damaged.\" And it got worse. I learned of the sinking of a ship where over nine thousand souls were lost.The action in this book finds Bernie working under assumed identity as concierge at the Grand Hotel on the French Riviera. I should say it starts off finding him in the depths of depression after his third wife has left him and his attempt at asphyxiation fails when the car he sits in runs out of gas.

I have now read all eleven novels -- and I think you have to read them in order -- and \"The Other Side of Silence\" is one of the better. Set in the Riviera and Germany both before and after WWII, the subject is blackmail and the addition is the fictional characterization of the famed English gay novelist and spy Somerset Maugham. The Painted Veil\"The Painted Veil\" is one of my favorite books and was made into an underappreciated movie with Edward Norton and Naomi Watts. Although I don't want to fight with blurbs, which may have been taken out of context, Salon's Jonathan Ames makes the bogus bold statement that \"Philip Kerr is the only bona fide heir to Raymond Chandler Raymond Chandler.\" Yes, his Bernie Gunther is a hard-boiled detective but the early books were marred by Chandleresque prose that tried to hard. Long ago, Kerr hit his stride. I love Chandler, don't get me wrong. But Kerr has outgrown his infatuation to write really fine prose, like this passage when an aging yet still virile Gunther has just been dumped by the femme fatale with whom he's fallen in love: \"In a way I'd seen it coming and been stupid enough to ignore what my keener senses had already told me. Not that it really counted for very much in the scheme of things. It was nothing more than just another tragedy in a long line of tragedies of the kind Bernie Gunther was already well used to. If anyone had the constitution to take it on the chin, that person was him, I told myself. Maybe that's what all human ordinary life amounts to. One tragedy heaped on top of another like sharp gray layers of shale.\" Great writing -- and notice the first-person narrator shifting into a third person reference to himself to show how disconnected he is to his own external identity. He is, at this time, living under an assumed name and trying and failing to achieve some sort of stability that will forever elude him. Unlike Chandler, Kerr's books are heavily researched and rich with WWII history (in that way he is like Alan Furst Alan Furst). Chandler's weren't historical fiction. And, given Kerr's eleven books that shift back and forth and time, we have seen Gunther struggle with personal and historical events -- including Hitler and the rise and fall of Nazism -- over many decades. If there is one thing, from a novelist's perspective, that annoys me in the style is Kerr's overuse of dialog for exposition -- characters often talk with Kerr holding the microphone too close, and the exchanges go on for too long when prose would have been more natural. But that's a writer's quibble. This is an enjoyable and interesting read, and if you're a Kerr addict like me, you pre-order. If you're just starting out on this wonderful road, begin here with The Berlin Noir trilogy: Berlin Noir: March Violets / The Pale Criminal / A German Requiem. And, if you just can't get enough, skip over to the great historical spy novelist Alan Furst, where it's less important to read in order.

Based in 1956. This is my first, and I was astonished at the quality of this work. Think of a combination of Le Carre and Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe.Brilliant plotting, character, and dialogue. I wish I had started at number 1, based before WWII - I will now!\"The war is over. Bernie Gunther, our sardonic former Berlin homicide detective and unwilling SS officer, is now living on the French Riviera. It is 1956 and Bernie is the go-to guy at the Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat, the man you turn to for touring tips or if you need a fourth for bridge. As it happens, a local writer needs just that, someone to fill the fourth seat in a regular game that is the usual evening diversion at the Villa Mauresque. Not just any writer. Perhaps the richest and most famous living writer in the world: W. Somerset Maugham. And it turns out it is not just a bridge partner that he needs; it\u2019s some professional advice. Maugham is being blackmailed\u2014perhaps because of his unorthodox lifestyle. Or perhaps because of something in his past, because once upon a time, Maugham worked for the British secret service, and the people now blackmailing him are spies.As Gunther fans know, all roads lead back to the viper\u2019s nest that was Hitler\u2019s Third Reich and to the killing fields that spread like a disease across Europe. Even in 1956, peace has not come to the continent: now the Soviets have the H-bomb and spies from every major power feel free to make all of Europe their personal playground.\""}, {"userName": "Larry Deaton", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2980533-larry-deaton", "userReview": "The latest book in Philip Kerr's Bernie Gunther series may indeed be his best yet.

There are also British traitors to deal with (Roger Hollis, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt, who were associates of Kim Philby.)Kerr weaves this story of life on the decadent Riviera, which only takes a few days, together with an extended flashback to Konigsberg when the city was falling to the Russians to give you an appreciation of the moral decisions that Gunther grapples with. One of the great things about the book was the brilliant move by Gunther to get out of jam he is in when he himself is accused of spying for the Russians.

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick", "userReview": "The Other Side of Silence is the 11th novel in Philip Kerr\u2018s bestselling series of detective stories featuring Bernie Gunther. (A 12th is forthcoming as I write.) However, unlike the books that precede it in the series, this suspenseful and well-crafted tale is primarily a post-war spy story. MI6, the East German Stasi, and the Soviet NKVD are all involved. For the most part, the previous 10 books have centered on crimes committed in Nazi Germany during the 1930s and in Nazi-occupied territory during World War II.The action in The Other Side of Silence takes place in 1956 on the French Riviera, where former Berlin homicide detective Bernie Gunther is working as the concierge at a luxury hotel under an assumed name. The year 1956 is an interesting and obviously deliberate choice. That was the eventful year when Britain and France went to war against Egypt after Gamal Abdel Nasser seized the Suez Canal. Almost simultaneously, the USSR squelched the Hungarian Revolution. And the wedding of Monaco\u2019s Prince Rainier and Hollywood star Grace Kelly is about to take place nearby. These events in the background anchor and help generate the urgency of the tale.Like every one of the novels that precede it in the Bernie Gunther series, The Other Side of Silence is grounded in history. Real-world personalities play central roles in the story: the 82-year-old W. Somerset Maugham, then the world\u2019s most famous and wealthiest author; the British Soviet spies, Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean; former Nazi spymaster Markus Wolf, number two in the Stasi; Sir John Sinclair, then Director General of MI6; and Roger Hollis, who became Director General of MI5 during the period depicted in the novel. Maugham himself was for many years a British spymaster, so this story is chock full of espionage agents.As always, Bernie stumbles into a beautiful woman, with whom he (predictably) falls hopelessly in love. Her name is Anne French. She\u2019s a writer who for some unstated reason is desperately eager to meet Somerset Maugham. She\u2019s convinced that Bernie can find a way to introduce them. Bernie calculates that he might be able to wangle an invitation if he teaches her to play bridge. Though Bernie is a reasonably skilled amateur player, Maugham is fanatical about bridge and supremely skilled at it. Naturally, Bernie\u2019s maneuvering to pull this off is merely the prelude to a complex story that brings him face to face with a mass murderer with whom he had a run-in in 1937. It also involves him with many of the aforementioned spies. The Other Side of Silence is another thrilling tale in the saga of Bernie Gunther."}], "description": "Bernie Gunther has done various jobs since the war. Now it's the 1950s and he's working in a hotel on the Cote D'Azur. It's winter, and the Riviera is empty and a little sad. In a bar one evening he bumps into Herr Leuthard, an acquaintance from the war, who offers him a most enticing job. Leuthard owns the Grand Hotel du Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. It's the best hotel on the Cote D'Azur and everyone has heard of it. Leuthard knows of Bernie' skills and thinks he could use them. Bernie's not so sure, says his detective days are over and he couldn't find a missing person in a phone booth.No matter, Leuthard tells him, I need a concierge, not a detective. A good concierge has to be a bit like a detective. He's expected to know things, to fix things - sometimes he has to know things he's not supposed to know, and do things that others wouldn't want to do. Pleasing guests can be a tricky business, especially the ones with a lot of money.It sounds like a cushy number for a man like Bernie Gunther. And so begins a new adventure for him, where he'll discover just how many bad people pass through the doors of the Grand Hotel du Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.", "title": "The Other Side of Silence\n      \n          (Bernie Gunther #11)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26834496-the-other-side-of-silence", "average": 4.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1459234756l/26834496.jpg", "reviews": 347, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/53936.Philip_Kerr", "name": "Philip Kerr"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26834496-the-other-side-of-silence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25893956-the-other-side-of-silence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35190748", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25500760-the-other-side-of-silence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28227295-the-other-side-of-silence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29983921-the-other-side-of-silence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/236819.March_Violets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/236814.Berlin_Noir", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118841.The_One_from_the_Other", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11448085-prague-fatale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/236816.The_Pale_Criminal"]}
