Cool. Except, your \"friend\" doesn't want to tell you about any of that. All he wants to do is describe the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built: So you're like, no, go back to the part about the ripped up bodies.And he's like, no, let me tell you more about the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built. And you say, tell me more about the gigantic albino penguins.And he says, haven't I told you about the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built yet? Tell me more about your team members and that one guy you were with when that blob monster chased you! No, I need to tell you about the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built when the light hits it at 2:31 p.m.Tell me more about what happened with that monster!And he's like, I think I need to tell you about the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built when the light hits it at 2:36 p.m. By that point you're like, That's OK! I've gotta go clean my fish tank now or something...and you're not my friend anymore...(and who the heck is Roerich?)By the time I reached the last part of this book, I really didn't care about the story or what was to be found in the grandest, deepest, most ancient of all chambers in Antarctica that he was leading up to. I didn't care what his teammate saw that he REFUSED to talk about. And I didn't care about the ENTIRE history of this civilization that he somehow managed to decipher from pictographs off a wall in less than a day. Perhaps the writer was trying to create suspense throughout the story, but I just felt teased and strung along for most of it."}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af

As I was experiencing Lovecraft\u2019s supremely awesome, nightmarish masterpiece, At the Mountains of Madness (ATMOM), it really struck me for the first time that he was a tremendously literate writer. I have been a fan of Lovecraft for a long time and have always been gaga for his bizarre imaginative stories. However, what jumped out at me on this reading of ATMOM was how impressively Lovecraft enhances the sense of dread that hangs over his stories through the colorful, melodramatic language he employs. He had a real gift for the written word. To demonstrate HPL's expertise with dramtic language, I have put together a few examples of quotes from ATMOM along with a more straight-forward, less colorful approach that a lesser \"non-awesome\" writer (NAW) might employ. EXAMPLE 1NAW: \"Finally, we arrived at the South Pole.\" \nHPL: \"At last we were truly entering the white, aeon-dead world of the ultimate south.\" \nEXAMPLE 2NAW: \"The sunlight reflecting off the ice created some unusual visual effects.\" \n HPL:\"Distant mountains floated in the sky like enchanted cities, and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver and scarlet land of Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun.\" \nEXAMPLE 3NAW: \"The mountain range had an eerie appearance\" \n HPL: \u201cIt was as if these stark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote time, space, and ultra-dimensionality. I could not help feeling that they were evil things\u2014mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss. That seething, half-luminous cloud background held ineffable suggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially spatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness, desolation, and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral world.\u201d \n EXAMPLE 4NAW: \u201cThe structures were of an extremely odd nature.\u201d \nHPL: \u201cThere were geometrical forms for which Euclid could scarcely find a name- cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation; terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion; shafts with odd bulbous enlargements; broken columns in curious groups; and five-pointed or five-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness.\u201d\n...What can we learn from the above? My takeaway is that Lovecraft was more than just a freakishly twisted genius creator of the superbly bizarre. He was also the king of melodrama who had literary chops to spare and could create atmosphere out of whole cloth even while describing the most mundane of activities. Put simply, HP Lovecraft was the MAN!!! It is also my opinion that the MAN was at his absolute best in ATMOM. I must admit that I say this with some hesitation because I have had a deep and long lasting love affair with both \u201cThe Call of Cthulhu\u201d and \u201cThe Dunwich Horror.\u201d However, despite an epic battle between story titans, I think that ATMOM wins a narrow victory because of its length and its detailed and comprehensive discussion of the \u201cCthulhu Mythos\u201d which I thought was superb. \nPLOT SUMMARY AND THOUGHTS\nATMOM is the story of a doomed scientific expedition to Antarctica told in the first person by William Dyer, a geologist from Lovecraft\u2019s famous \u201cMiskatonic University.\u201d Dyer explains at the very beginning of the novella that his reason for putting this story to paper is in the hope that that by recounting his extraordinary experiences, he can dissuade any further exploration of the region. He also recognizes the likelihood that the more fantastic elements of his story will not be accepted: \n Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet if I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left.\nThe main expedition group (which does not include our narrator) begins exploration of the surrounding area. They eventually discover 14 specimens of a previously unknown species of life (having both plant and animal qualities) that appear to be close to 50 Million years old. The discovery calls into question all of the current scientific theories regarding the history of life on Earth. Despite their age, 8 of the 14 specimens appear to be in almost pristine condition. One of the group members provides the following description of these Elder Things:\n Six feet end to end, three and five-tenths feet central diameter, tapering to one foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious growths\u2013combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans which gives almost a seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal myth, especially fabled Elder Things in the Necronomicon.\n When Dyer and the remaining members of the party suddenly lose contact with the expedition, they fly to the camp to investigate and what they find is\u2026\u2026\u2026I am going to stop there so as not to give away any major spoilers. Let me just say that what Dyer and Danforth (another group member) find at the camp and what they encounter during their subsequent investigations are the stuff of glorious, wonderful and terrifying nightmares as only HP can write them. In addition, a portion of the remaining story is a wonderfully detailed back story of many central aspects of Lovecraft\u2019s universe. It has been said that ATMOM was Lovecraft\u2019s way of re-categorizing the Cthulhu mythology from his earlier stories into something with more of a science fiction flavor. Mythology, fantasy or science fiction, whatever flavor you want to call it, it is scrumptiously DELICIOUS. Finally, ATMOM ties together many of Lovecraft\u2019s earlier stories, including: \u201cThe Dunwich Horror, \u201cThe Call of Cthulhu,\u201d \u201cThe Colour Out of Space,\u201d \u201cHaunter in the Dark,\u201d \u201cThe Thing on the Doorstep,\u201d \u201cPickman\u2019s Model,\u201d and \u201cThe Shadow over Innsmouth.\u201d Long time readers of Lovecraft will have fun spotting the references and connections to these stories. To sum up, this is an extraordinary story and is now on my list of \u201cAll Time Favorites.\u201d While HPL has written so many wonderful stories that it is hard to call any one his masterpiece. However, if you had to select just one story to embody the greatness of Lovecraft\u2019s work, you could do worse than picking this novella. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! P.S. Here is a bonus quote and accompanying photo that I did not have a good place to include it in the body of the review. Enjoy.\n\u201cIt was the utter, objective embodiment of the fantastic novelist's \"thing that should not be\"; and its nearest comprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees it from a station platform - the great black front looming colossally out of infinite subterraneous distance, constellated with strangely coloured lights and filling the prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinder.\""}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "A TRAGIC HOMECOMINGAnd so we slept for a million millennia, on the edge of our great city. So close and yet so far! Why were we outside of our fair city, our families and companions mere steps away? The reasons are lost in time. And as we slumbered, our tropical paradise became a land of neverending winter, a polar graveyard. \nWe were woken, those of us who still lived. Four lived and four were lost. We woke in confusion and terror, our tropic city gone, the snow and wind howling around us. Strange bipedal things cried out and lay their hands upon us, intent on experimentation, their four-legged companions barking and savage... we slew them all in our panic. Odd creatures, these bipedal explorers. Were they the new masters of this world? Were they our peers? We, the Elder Race, have few of those.\nWe took some of their equipment, and a body each of the bipeds and their companions for further study. We buried our dead and then made haste back to our city, to see what changes a million millennia had wrought. After our leave-taking, new explorers arrived. They discovered our city.\n\nWe returned to our home. It had became an empty palace of the dead. Where were our fellows? Where were our servants, the creatures we called Shoggoths?\nOnly our loyal companions remained in this terrible empty city. They squawked their excitement at our return. A million millennia is a long time! But they could tell us nothing of what had become of our world.\n\nAnd as we explored our ruins, so the new explorers explored as well. \n\nOvercome with despair, we journeyed to a refuge that had been built by our kind, a city constructed within a subterranean sea. We followed our tunnels down. And there we found not our sought-for homecoming... but another necropolis. And so we found our doom. Shoggoths! Traitorous servants! As they had risen up against our kind in ages past, they had rebelled again - but this time they had won. They had destroyed our undersea refuge and all of our kind. And as we gazed upon our shattered city within the dark waters beneath the earth, the Shoggoths rose once more... and slew the last of us. 'Twas indeed a tragic homecoming. We that remained of the Elder Race, lost out of time, born again into a world so strange, and then so quickly slain.The biped explorers had their own meeting with our rebel servants. The meeting did not go well.\nAnd yet, unlike us, they managed to escape the Shoggoths, and fled our city. In their flight, did they pass near that fearsome land next to ours, beyond our mountains? Ancient Kadath. A place out of time, home to the Old Ones. Terrible Kadath! We had lived in Kadath's shadow, in the shadow of those old slumbering gods, so long ago.

Keely", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely", "userReview": "I used to defend Lovecraft's reputation, arguing that he'd suffered the same fate as fellow pulp author Howard: that later writers, hoping to profit off of his name, put it on the cover of all sorts of middling short story collections--cliche and badly-written stuff that (if the reader is lucky) might actually contain one or two stories by the original author.However, in this tale, Lovecraft proves that he can write just as badly as his gaggle of followers. It is meant to be a story of the fantastical, of the supernatural, of mystery and suspense--yet it is full of the very things that kill off any sense of wonder or the uncanny. Nothing demysticizes like familiarity, and this book is full of precise descriptions of his monstrous creatures, their histories, their habits--Lovecraft even spends a few paragraphs telling us how they like to furnish and decorate their living rooms. A tip for writers of the supernatural: if you want a being to be mysterious and unsettling, don't go off on a tangent about its commitment to feng shui.In the Annotated Lovecraft, where I most recently read this story, noted critic S.T. Joshi claims that Lovecraft wasn't a pulp author, but something else, something greater--yet this story, one of Lovecraft's most well-known, is rife with all the worst habits of the pulps: pointless details, repetitive descriptions, crutch words, extensive exposition, little change in tone or voice, convenient plotting, and impossibly insightful protagonists. Beyond that, Lovecraft doesn't even deliver on those things that make pulps worth reading in the first place: verve, action, dynamic characters, and tension.The whole story is basically a scientist explaining to the reader a series of carvings that he's looking at. The actual plot--the fact that he and his team of researchers are trapped in Antarctica and think that something is killing them off--is treated as a secondary concern.The thin story is padded out by interminable details, the same comments and observations, repeated over and over, page after page. Like a bad game of Dungeons and Dragons, every new room is needlessly described: they entered a spheroid oblong, 63 yards long and 41 yards wide, the walls were worked stone, covered in carvings depicting some tentacled creature.There are always carvings.As we go along, the protagonist describes it all to us minutely, with a level of insight that grows increasingly laughable. At one point, he mentions that he can somehow tell, by a series of ancient stone-etched pictures left by an alien race, that they had lost the skill of telepathy and switched to spoken communication. In the real world, archaeologists struggle their entire careers to figure out what particular people, places, events, and objects are being represented in surviving remnants of murals, but our plucky narrator doesn't suffer a moment's confusion on how aliens artistically rendered telepathic powers some hundred million years ago.Indeed, the entire expedition seems to have a level of knowledge and familiarity with 'eldritch tomes' and 'esoteric history' that is quite impressive. Keep in mind that these aren't paranormal researchers, but regular geologists, archaeologists, paleontologists, &c.--and yet, every time they enter a new room, they never fail to comment that this or that carving reminds them of something they once read in the Necronomicon. They throw off references to the mi-go and the shaggoth as if discussing nothing so remarkable as varieties of sparrow, and recall in detail historical events of a hundred million years ago with the utmost nonchalance.Apparently, far from being an incomprehensible mystery the mere overhearing of which accursed syllables invokes incurable madness, the History of Cthonic Horrors is in fact a basic undergrad class required at all proper universities (and Marty's favorite topic when he's trying to impress drunk girls at the Young Scientists mixer).Now, perhaps the fact that the narrator never fails to halt his headlong flight from horrid monsters in order to examine and explain the carvings is meant to represent the fellow's meticulous character--which brings up an important writing lesson: once a fact has been established in the text, it does not need to be reiterated ad nauseam. You don't have to mention the character's clothes and sword in every scene, because once those things have been described, the reader isn't going to assume the character is suddenly naked and defenseless just because the scene changed. Having the character demonstrate this trait once or twice in a story is perfectly effective, without wasting a lot of space reiterating.Reading this plodding list of details reminded me of nothing so much as discussing writing with a teenage would-be fantasy author: ask about his book, and he'll spend forty minutes telling you what color swords the southern nation has, how many priest-kings ruled in succession over the Lost Isles, what city-states exported the most grain in the decades since the mana-plague, and the convoluted rules he's put together for how a fire spell works.In short, by the end, he hasn't mentioned anything that resembles a story: no sense of character, psychology, pacing, tone, plotting, structure, theme, climax, pivotal scenes, conflict, tension, style, language, dialogue--never forget that, when it comes to a good story, setting is irrelevant. Get together some costumes and props, build a set, arrange the furniture, get your lighting perfect, and guess what: you still don't have a play.Yet you can perform Shakespeare in a blank room, all the actors dressed in nondescript black, and you'll still get a great story, great characters and emotions and moments. Change the setting to a space station, an elf kingdom, a Wild West boomtown, a port full of pirates, and it doesn't matter--the story is still the thing that carries it.It's frustrating to watch an author just obsess over details, because overall, it's something they do to please themselves, not their audience. It's like a set dresser carefully filling all the drawers on set with realistic, accurate props that will never be used in the play, never seen by the audience. At some point, it's just a self-indulgent game.However, that doesn't mean I don't understand the appeal of this story--indeed, it has consistently been popular, republished over and over throughout the years as a 'Lovecraft classic'. It's chock-full of exposition and explanation, and there are few things that fandom likes more. To have Lovecraft's world, his mysteries, his horrors laid out so simply, so fully, makes them easy to understand, easy to tie together--and easy to obsess over. That collection of little details, of the inner-workings of a fictional world is what much of fandom is built on. It is less a story and more a Star Wars technical guide.A proper mystery, a story of true terror and fantasy doesn't give out simple explanations, because that would undermine the very sense of unease, of the supernatural on which such a story is based. Mystery and explanation are antithetical to one another: once the mystery has been explained, then the mystery has ended.Yet, there are many readers who come away from a fantastical story asking 'what really happened?'--which, of course, is the wrong question, because what really happened was that an author sat down and created a piece of fiction from his imagination. There is no reality outside of the story, the story exists to be a good story, to have feeling, pacing, and structure that works. A story does not actually exist in any concrete world 'out there' to be discovered and enumerated.The error Lovecraft makes here (the same error Mike Mignola made with Hellboy recently) was taking a strange and fantastical world and trying to 'lock it down', to make it into something explicable, predictable, fundamentally known. Some might suggest that this urge opens up that world to other authors, by allowing them to know what 'really happened', but in truth, it closes off the world, it limits fundamentally what that world can be, and what stories can take place within it--not only for other prospective authors, but also for readers.It shrinks the whole thing down and makes it more easily digestible--which is diametrically opposed to the supposed theme of Lovecraft's stories: that there are things, both objects and ideas that are larger than we are, that are too grand for us to ever truly understand, things that cannot be simply encapsulated through a straightforward summary of events. This story, more than any other, is a betrayal of the very thing that is supposed to set Lovecraft's work apart, making it interesting and influential in the first place.Instead, we get something along the lines of 'true tales' of Atlantis and the Hollow Earth that charlatans were peddling at the time, and which have since transformed into shows about 'Ancient Aliens' on the History Channel. Perhaps that's the true legacy of Lovecraft's work: uncredentialed wackos spouting paranoid alien conspiracies--well, that and cute Cthulhu plushies."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Hi, I'm Rob Lowe and I just read Mountains of Madness by H.P.

Lovecraft. If you're an old role-playing game geek like me, this will appeal to the dungeoneer in you. Plenty of delving and mystery in this one!If you're a fan of the movie Prometheus, you'd do well to hark back to the origin of many of the movie's tropes. They are similar, at least on the surface: An impossibly old alien race creates life on earth for the purpose of enslaving it, yadda, yadda. If you hated the movie Prometheus, you'd do well to hark back to the origin of many of the movie's tropes . . . need I go on?The story begins with that rarefied sense of heroic antarctic exploration that permeated the accounts of Scott, Amundsen, and Shackleton's expeditions. At that time, such an expedition was fraught with danger, due to drifting ice, unforeseen logistical shortcomings, and, of course, the weather. Since the Antarctic was relatively unknown when Lovecraft wrote the story, it's easy to see why he would set his story in what appeared in that day to be an utterly alien place, though it was right here at home on planet earth.Or was it \"home,\" really? Whose home? And for how long?Now, I'm a big Lovecraft fan. But there was one thing, stylistically, that drove me absolutely nuts about this story. It's a minor thing, but it prevents me from giving an unbridled five-star rating to the story. Frankly, I really disliked the use of shortwave reports between the narrator, William Dyer, and Lake's remote base. The choppiness of the language seemed correct and historically accurate to me, since shortwave radio had been in use for only a decade or so before Lovecraft wrote the story. The characters would, like Lovecraft, have been habituated to using short, choppy phrases because of the telegraph system that preceded the explosion of shortwave radio in the 1920s. But what didn't seem correct, and what threw me out of the rhythm of the story, was the use of flowery words and complex phraseology in the messages themselves. They aren't as blatantly ugly on paper as they are when read aloud. Try it sometime. It feels overwrought and contrived. Not to mention that these info-dumps could have been spread out and integrated into the story itself a little better. But this is a minor complaint. All-in-all, I loved the slow escalation of the horror in the story. It begins with a lot of hyperbole and, indeed, engages in it throughout. Still, Lovecraft manages to build the sense of dread to a fitting crescendo. In several instances, I was surprised by a plot twist that I should have seen coming. Ah, Lovecraft, you trickster! You fooled me again!One thing I really enjoyed was the narrator's ambiguous feelings regarding the Old Ones. Though his primary emotional reaction toward these beings are fear and revulsion, there is also a moment of pity and near-empathy that I found endearing. This is not my favorite Lovecraft story. But it's not one of his lesser works, either. If you haven't had a crack at Lovecraft, it's not a bad place to start. And if you're a Lovecraft fan, as I am, you'll recognize many of the elements, though you'll be surprised by others, such as the narrator's conflicting feelings that I've outlined above. I'm no expert on Lovecraft's evolution as a storyteller, but I have to wonder if these surprises are indicative of a certain maturation in his writing. Someone smarter than me with more resources and time will have to determine that. For my own reading enjoyment, though, At the Mountains of Madness, though flawed, still reflects the writer's genius.

People love the whole mythos thing, and I don't blame them, because the Lovecraftian mythos is awesome. But I don't particularly enjoy actually reading Lovecraft because his actual stories simply aren't very good. In this novel, for example, the story is basically a framework for him to do some world building. There's no real plot, character development, or dramatic tension. Lovecraft is clearly more concerned with building a history of the Old Ones than he is in telling a good story. I think I might get more enjoyment from reading Lovecraft's wikipedia page than I do from reading any of his stories. This might sound like a horrible thing to say about an author, but it's not meant to be. Again, I think the worlds that Lovecraft builds are AWESOME.

We are in Lovecraft\u2019s universe where even penguins are grotesque. I mean, whoever heard of an ugly penguin? At the Mountains of Madness is H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s best known novel, not that difficult an accomplishment as he did not write that many (only this one and The Case of Charles Dexter Ward I believe. A wise decision because I find that his style is much more suited to the short story format. There are some amazing, creepy and wildly entertaining tales in the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d anthology The Best of H.P. Lovecraft Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre that I reviewed rambled about in detail.At the Mountains of Madness is basically about an expedition to an unexplored part of Antarctica. The intrepid explorers of course run into weird Lovecraftian things and the protagonist lives to tell the tale as a deterrent to other explorers. The main asset of this book is Lovecraft\u2019s painstaking world building, free from the constraint of the short story format he takes his time describing the setup, the landscape and the increasingly strange discoveries. As a result the novel is steeped in creepy atmosphere you can really immerse into.That said I really don\u2019t think this should be anyone\u2019s gateway into Lovecraft\u2019s fiction. The descriptions can seem a little interminable and the pacing can be something of a slog for the impatient readers, especially if they are not familiar with Lovecraft\u2019s idiosyncratic writing style. The readers who have enjoyed some Lovecraft stories, especially the \u201cThe Cthulhu Mythos\u201d one will find much to enjoy here. The infamous Necronomicon by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred (as opposed his totally sane relatives I guess) is often referred to. The Elder Ones, the Shoggoths and some unnamed things even the monsters are sacred of are featured. As usual with Lovecraft there is no dialogue to speak of and characterization is nonexistent. There is also not a lot of action in this book, the climax is a little vague. All the creepy setup does not result in a spectacular payoff. If you just read it for the creep factor you should be well satisfied.In spite of its popularity this is not my favorite of his works but personally I will always have time for more Lovecraft.(3.5 stars)"}, {"userName": "Jesse Dixon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2658912-jesse-dixon", "userReview": "[Group of scientists go to Antarctica, one group are killed, other group of two investigate, find aliens.

White, Cold ice giants with funny penguins dancing around like happy feet!That was before I read this book.If you ask me now about South pole, I would probably answer you in a toneless voice and a daunting thousand-yard stare....\" It is a white, aeon-dead world which has shunned most of the living organisms, a nightmarish gateway to accursed ultimate abyss where stark unforgiving winds whisper the songs of death: the millions of years old runes of old ones....and no one can even find a polar bear to cuddle as they are found in the North Pole.\"An expedition to unknown.Isn't that how all the greatest disaster stories begin? William Dyer, a geologist and a professor at Miskatonic University retells his disastrous and horrifying expedition to Antarctica, in the hope to prevent any other research team from making the same mistakes he did. The mistake of entering the lifeless world in the name of science which resulted in deaths of his colleagues as well as discoveries that could destroy the world. Word of advice; Do not read this story as your introduction to Lovecraftian works. Start with some of his well-known short works.Why?Lovecraft's writing style is truly like an abyss of dark poems. He conjures up the words in a dark fashion which gradually pushes you into a unworldly and unrealistic plane of horrors. So it's better to start small, understand his style and then read this because At the Mountains of Madness is one of his longest stories.There is also a second reason. The \"old gods\" mentioned in this story needs a better and bigger introduction (which can be found in author's other dark short stories) before one pick up this book to truly enjoy the story. The old ones are explored deeply and shown in a completely different light, exploring their history and origin like never before! Overall it's a great read with the usual Lovecraftian creepiness mixed with a bit of Jules Verne, albeit a bit long and slow in the middle chapters.----------------------------------------I also found a novelette, A Colder War (1997) by Charles Stross which is loosely connected to the aftermath of this story.There is a  graphic novel adaption too!

This was no doubt due to Lovecraft\u2019s lifelong enthusiasm for the Antarctic explorers. At the Mountains of Madness has its literary fathers\u2014Poe\u2019s A. Gordon Pym, M.P. Sheil\u2019s The Purple Cloud\u2014but H.P.\u2019s principal sources were the contemporaneous accounts of the expeditions themselves. Byrd\u2019s was of course his immediate inspiration (Byrd returned in 1930, At the Mountains of Madness was written in 1931), but Lovecraft had also followed not only Amundsen\u2019s and the unfortunate Scott\u2019s undertakings (1912) when he was a very young man but also Borchegrevink\u2019s Southern Cross Expedition (1902) when he was still a boy. Lovecraft took pains to get the details right, and it shows.The perfectly realized polar setting, though, is only part of it. The detailed treatment of the underground cyclopean city is very good too, but H.P. had done this sort of thing before, and done it well\u2014almost as good as here. No, it is the scientifically precise description of the bodies of \u201cThe Elder Things\u201d that first throws fear into the reader\u2019s heart. What follows is a transcription of the wireless transmissions made by Lake, a professor of biology at Miskatonic University: \n\u201c10:15 P.M. Important discovery. Orrendorf and Watkins, working underground at 9:45 with light, found monstrous barrel-shaped fossil of wholly unknown nature; probably vegetable unless overgrown specimen of unknown marine radiata. Tissue evidently preserved by mineral salts. Tough as leather, but astonishing flexibility retained in places. Marks of broken-off parts at ends and around sides. Six feet end to end, 3.5 feet central diameter, tapering to 1 foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious growths. Combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans. All greatly damaged but one, which gives almost seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal myth, especially fabled Elder Things in Necronomicon. These wings seem to be membraneous, stretched on framework of glandular tubing. Apparent minute orifices in frame tubing at wing tips. Ends of body shrivelled, giving no clue to interior or to what has been broken off there. Must dissect when we get back to camp. Can\u2019t decide whether vegetable or animal. Many features obviously of almost incredible primitiveness. . . . Having trouble with dogs. They can\u2019t endure the new specimen, and would probably tear it to pieces if we didn\u2019t keep it at a distance from them.\u201d\nI\u2019ll stop here, because I don\u2019t want to spoil things for you. Things get weirder with Lake\u2019s account of the dissection, and even weirder when\u2014soon after\u2014his regular transmissions disappear into radio silence. It is then that the narrator, geology professor William Dyer, accompanied by graduate student Danforth, go in search of the advance expedition. What they find are the ruins of an alien civilization, a tale of cultural degeneracy outlined in bas-relief, an explanation for the disappearance of Lake and his men, and a final intolerable horror.I don\u2019t want to give the best away, but I think I can say this much: the ending of At the Mountain of Madness is particularly good because 1) the Elder Things you view with horror at first later become sympathetic as you realize the greater horror they themeselves face, 2) the tale of Elder Things and their sad fate is filled with bizarre echoes of American Slavery in a way that (at least for me) both affirms Lovecraft\u2019s racism and redeems it.All things considered, it is one of Lovecraft\u2019s best. But its publication history was not a happy one. Weird Tales refused it because it was too long, and, although it was eventually published in Astounding Stories (Feb., March, April 1936), Astounding editor F. Orlin Tremaine chopped up H.P.\u2019s paragraphs, changed his punctuation, and cut out a thousand words toward the end.

Lovecraft has proven that he is master of descriptive writing that creates a sense of mystery, atmosphere, and dismay. The author\u2019s vivid depictions of the landscape of these Polar Regions pull the reader into a nightmare realm and leave the reader with a disturbing sense of loneliness and anticipation of what the explorers will encounter next.

Maybe for me when I was twelve?But. I did enjoy the story, I mean - the ideas, some of them at least, were interesting, I was curious as to where the whole thing was heading and it was sort of satisfying in the end. Lovecraft's writing is undeniably well crafted and polished, even though I was a bit tired of endless descriptions, as the descriptions is not my thing at all, unless something peculiar, exotic and fantastic is being described - like aliens or artifacts of all kinds. That's why I could bear with it to some point in \"Mountains\". I won't start with counting how many novels and movies ripped the idea(s) of the novelette, you know that already. It's a milestone for sci-fi and horror and I appreciate its importance.Alas, right now 'tis the time to feel the foul smell of Old Ones, as I am going to spill some bile.I wasn't scared for a second and I wasn't even getting into the atmosphere of dark mystery or anything. Maybe if it wasn't a first person narration it would work for me? It's like this narrator guy is in some state of neurosis or something, because whenever he sees something bigger than him, something he can't explain immediately, something that is covered from his view - he gets a bad feeling, he knows it's evil, he feels it's sinister, it's abhorrent and it's unnatural and it's disturbing. I guess he wasn't checked at doctor's before this trip, or maybe he lacked some essential vitamins in his diet, I assume magnesium and folic acid as well.He mentions disturbing Nicholas Roerich's paintings, for example. I mean, seriously, that guy? go google him and if you find any images of him disturbing you on the level of horror you do need help. And I'm not saying it to insult you, I just really worry about you in case his art disturbs you just like our narrator. I wonder how our narrator would react to the art of the late H.R.Giger? That's Necronomicon for you, pal!This constant looking out at everything and seeing abominations everywhere, even in every shape of nature and animals got really sort of annoying at some point. And silly. Also it's really not fair when the narrator says something like \"I saw horrors and monstrosities, they all were so monstrous and horrendous that I won't dare to mention them here...\" Every time I read similar lines in books I feel like asking for a refund and leaving the show. I want the damn monstrosities and abominations to show up! I don't want the descriptions of shadows and stink, and scary sounds, and how narrators' guts were wrenching and sphincters were clenching instead!I digress. Forgive me.However, I understand this is how atmosphere is built and I should really let it go, I guess, and so I am. Expedition, adventure, mysteries and secrets revealed, what's not to like? And monsters. Aliens. The Old Ones.When the monster looks like an overgrown cucumber with fake wings, spaghetti pasta instead of limbs and some sea creature on top I kind of start giggling and fail to dig the horror yet another time. It's an alien all right, but please don't suggest me being afraid of it. And of course its blood is green, it's a cucumber after all! And no wonder it stank - in USSR there was this cologne for men called \"Ogurechniy\" (cucumber), you have no idea how stinky it was, so I kind of have an idea of the stink. I for once believe the narrator.But fine. I guess an alien is an alien and I have a respect for them no matter how they looked, I won't be discriminating their silly looks and I will instead appreciate the civilization they built. They left their story - the story of their WHOLE span of history on Earth - in the elaborate and highly mastered works of art - the mural sculptures. \"The technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and aesthetically evolved to the highest degree of civilised mastery; though utterly alien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race. In delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach it.\" While I hardly believe they could create any delicacies with their spaghettis, I will buy this information. What I don't buy, is how narrator and his partner in descent to ancient city could DECiPHER everything. You're so full of shit, mr Lovecraft!!! How on earth, how this was possible?? This alien cucumbers, they were so \"utterly alien\", your narrator couldn't understand their writing, not a single thing was known about them before, because he never finished the abhorrent book of Necronomicon, yet he was able to read the carvings or sculptures and clearly explain everything to himself and us! Like, to smallest details! Culture, traditions! This is like if it was me, in the Prometheus movie, looking at the stella in the forbidden chamber and saying, oooh, I get it, I get now everything about their rituals and xenomorphs and what black goo was. Ok, wrong example, we barely could see what the stella was about, unless we stopped the vid on youtube or googled it really obsessively. I did, not like it helped. But I still don't believe any explanations could be given in some couple or plus another couple of hours they've been in there, in those building or caves. The narrator didn't say he worked it all out after the years of analyzing, no, he said they understood everything immediately on place. Hence their knowledge on shoggoths and such. Like, you ask yourself, how many years it took people to decipher Dresden codes or Egyptian writings? This guy must have been some genius! Both of them. Or maybe he was psychic? That would explain a lot. Now, the shoggots. I have a problem with the concept of the whole thing here. I mean first narrator fears/hates Old Ones, then he kind of respects them for building their civilization and basically is ready to obey to their higher intellect. And then he learns about shoggots and their evolution and then he... feels for poor masters that lost their obedient slaves and hates the slaves for outsmarting their masters, who basically used them and abused them and then used them again. And he deeply sympathises with the Old Ones. Wow. Kinda rings a bell? \"we had slavery, but america was great\" sort of bell? This is really troubling me. Yeah, shoggots were disgusting. But Lovecraft was racist, which is more disgusting. In some of his works he managed to avoid such tones and subjects. And I thought he almost did in this one. Figures he didn't.Nonetheless, I did have some fun. Because I had some laugh and I read one of the classics of horror genre, which is a reward in itself. Now I can rant with Guillermo del Toro on his unmade movie, if I ever meet him! At the time his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single mad word of all too obvious source: \u201cTekeli-li! Tekeli-li!\u201d Ahahahahahahaha!

The guy had issues and his prose was the purplest, like most pulp writers of his time. But all American fantasy and horror written since the 1930s has been influenced by Lovecraft. Lovecraft himself was heavily influenced by others, of course, and At the Mountains of Madness, one of his most famous works, made explicit reference to Edgar Allen Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.This is a novella about a scientific expedition to Antarctica. The Antarctic was even more mysterious and unknown in the 1930s, so it was a perfect place for Lovecraft to situate an ancient, alien city. His narrator, in recounting his perilous journey from which only he and one other explorer/scientist returned, is attempting to discourage others from following in their footsteps, lest they too unearth Things Man Was Not Meant to Know.All the classic Lovecraft tropes are here \u2014 alienness incomprehensible to human minds, non-Euclidian geometry, sanity loss, and awful truths about prehistory revealed. The city the scientists discover in the South Pole was once inhabited by a race of creatures from another star, known only as the Old Ones. The Old Ones were scientifically and culturally advanced, and created servants to help them build their great cities. These servants, awful, intelligent monstrosities known as Shoggoths, eventually rebelled against their creators, making this ancient story literally older than mankind.Surprisingly to me, given Lovecraft's usual xenophobia and characterization of the alien as unknowable and inimical, his narrator displays an almost touching compassion and understanding for the Old Ones, observing that they were simply \"men of another age, albeit alien.\"In the climax, the awful truth is revealed, there is much slime and carnage, and the narrator narrowly escapes from the terrible underground tunnels of the ancient city of the Old Ones.You will never see penguins the same way again. Tekeli-li!"}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "At the Mountains of Madness is one of H.P. Lovecraft's longest stories, and one of the few not set in his trademark New England setting. I've often seen it mentioned as the definitive Lovecraft story, and the best introduction to his Cthulu mythos, but I don't agree - and will explain why shortly.At the Mountains of Madness is narrated by William Dyer, a geologist and professor at Arkham's Miskatonic University, in the form of a warning: Dyer writes down the account of an expedition to Antarctica in which he took part in order to stop another one which is being planned. Dyer's account aims to reveal information previously undisclosed, and deter any potential explorers - though despite the written and photographic proof he offers, he fears that his warnings might be in vain.Dyer's expedition was supposed to drill the frozen earth and collect samples for further study; what it found in the desolate, white emptiness of Antarctica are frozen remains of unknown specimens, perfectly preserved. This is just the beginning: soon a part of Dyer's team is brutally murdered, and the bodies of dogs and humans torn open and dissected. A trail of strange, inhuman footprints leads Dyer and his companion to a range of mountains higher than the Himalayas; they cross the monstrous range by an airplane, and discover prehuman, frozen ruins of a city, with architecture completely alien to the human imagination.This discovery is also the story's biggest drawback. Essentially, from the moment Dyer enters the frozen ruins Lovecraft begins to tell the reader the entire history of the ancient civilization which once inhabited them - down to minute detail. Dyer watches ancient pictographs and the layouts of the rooms he goes through, and delivers minutiae about the ancient creatures in the dullest possible way - there is no excitement, joy (or in this case fright) of a discovery in this novel - there's only information, information and information. At the Mountains of Madness becomes a giant infodump - it's like Lovecraft was writing a short history of an imagined ancient civilization and not a story, which I guess was what he actually was doing. At the Mountains of Madness is filled with good imagery (such as overgrown, grotesque penguins), but this same imagery is completely suffocated by the sheer amount of information Lovecraft dumps on his readers - without any real plot or character development. At the Mountains of Madness ignores the idea of showing, not telling, and tells, tells, tells - to put it simply, I never thought that a tragic exploration of Antarctica could be so dull and boring. Lovecraft wrote down the condensed history of the Old Ones, but forgot to embed it into a narrative which would be even remotely engaging. The pacing at times is truly glacial, and even the trademark gloomy conclusion doesn't quite save it - after reading several of Lovecraft's stories I got used to it and came almost to expect it.The best part about reading the book was China Mieville's introduction, in which he discusses Lovecraft's major themes and his influence on horror and weird writing - but while I can see and agree with the points that he makes, I ultimately cannot share his enthusiasm and admiration for At the Mountains of Madness."}, {"userName": "Kaora", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora", "userReview": "I could not help feeling that they were evil things-mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss.My husband has always loved Lovecraft and tried to convince me to read him, so this was my first experience with Lovecraft's writings.For the most part I enjoyed it. It was a bit slow at the start, as Lovecraft puts such incredible detail into crafting his stories, including the longitude and latitude of the explorer's camps and the measurements of the mountains they are exploring.The incredible detail worked when it came to mapping out their discoveries, and the horrors that awaited them in the mountains. The tale isn't very long, and didn't really creep me out, but the writing is good and the tale was intriguing enough to keep me turning pages.It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of earth\u2019s dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests."}, {"userName": "Thanos", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35198318-thanos", "userReview": "\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03b8\u03b1 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03b3\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf. \u039f\u03b9 \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Lovecraft \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c8\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03b5\u03be\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03af \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5.\u039f\u03b9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Lovecraft \u03b1\u03c2 \u03be\u03b5\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03af\u03c3\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2.\u03a3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u2026 \u0391\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 read with caution!"}], "description": "At the Mountains of Madness is a novella by horror writer H.
