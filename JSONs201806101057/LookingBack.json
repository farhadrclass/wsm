The antiquated language and 1940s attitudes of the characters was incongruous, given that they were using cellphones and listening to CDs. It felt like someone had put the cast of an old 40s movie into a time machine and dumped them into 21st century New England. I hated all the main characters, felt sorry for their husbands and the plot was so transparent that it was completely obvious what was going to happen. *cringe*"}, {"userName": "Michelle Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3485266-michelle-robinson", "userReview": "I think this book is well written the charachters are well drawn and are quite believable. The is no neat closure at the end of the book. I like that it felt more real.I personally could not like this book due to the way it ends. I understand that the ending is probably really realistic and what could actually happen. However, I was so disgusted by Norma and her total lack of conscience that I never quite got over it. In that this book left a lasting impression on me, I would recommend it. However, I disliked Norma to such a degree that I never read another Belva Plain book. I know that is an extreme but it was my true feeling. Years later I could still remember almost this whole book, just not the title. I searched for it for quite a while to include it here in my booklist.

The dialogue and thoughts of the characters was reminiscent of the mid 1900s with virginity before marriage and staying at home afterwards and raising children while the characters used technology like cellphones. I have read that this author is well liked and people enjoy her novels but this one didn't do it for me."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/203464-elaine", "userReview": "This book is set in modern times however all the characters talk and act like they should be part of their parent's generation which gives the story the feeling of being stuck in a kind of time-warp.

As the story unfolds, some of their experiences are interesting and somewhat predictable. The situation one of the women gets into to is so horrific, that perhaps I began to disengage from the story.

I really had to work to finish the book. I'm not one to jump ship, hoping something in the end will redeem the book. I'm sorry to say nothing could save this book. What begins as an engaging story about three college roommates; brainy Norma, lovely Amanda, preppy Cecile and their differing futures takes a bewildering stumble into quicksand. When the three women graduate, Amanda, desperate to escape her lower-class background, marries Larry Balsan, Norma's brother, who is in the family real estate business. As Mrs. Balsan, she can shop to her heart's content, but she soon realizes she is not as happy as Cecile, who marries her college sweetheart (architect Peter), or even Norma, who is biding her time until she meets Mr. Right. So far so good, but the plot is thrown off kilter when Amanda and her aloof, widower father-in-law inexplicably tumble into an affair. The awkwardness of such a union bleeds into the prose, and Plain is unable to make the twist work. There is no satisfying tension or electricity between Amanda and L.B., as he is known, so their passionate affair rings false. Plain compounds the problems with her plot by turning the steadfast Norma into a conniving schemer who, out of misguided loyalty to her brother, undermines Cecile's husband. An unsatisfying end that pits friends against each other."}, {"userName": "H Green", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42621934-h-green", "userReview": "send again later"}, {"userName": "Meryan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8992462-meryan", "userReview": "This is about 3 girls that went to college together, Cecile, who is the confident and rich one.

I truly believe that Belva Plain has a voice all her own and it comes from real-life drama within families. This novel was an eye opener and yet not too surprising with how things unfolded although I was caught up with what happened to the family. I strongly believe that family is the most important thing and family must always remain full of unconditional love as well as integrity and morals. I hate dishonest people and hate infidelity with every fiber of my being. Somehow those that are not walking upright are paid their due reward for their actions."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "They were the most unlikely friends - kind, rich Cecile, brave, talented Norma and Amanda the poor girl they met at college.

I have to admit that I loved this book myself but then, I love Belva Plain's work. In my opinion, she was a brilliant author. She will be missed very dearly. I enjoyed this book very much and will give it an A+! I tend to ignore readers' reviews until I've read the book, I notice.

I can't say why without giving away the entire storyline but the affair wasn't at all credible and neither was the betrayal at the very end. The women were all expected to get married and then be little housewives instead of wanting big bad careers but these were educated, intelligent women. I might have accepted this from a book written in the 1940s, when women had few other options, but this was fairly recent and had a contemporary setting. Having loved Evergreen when it first came out, I left this one feeling very disappointed.
