Stop it, White ol' boy, you're killing me!TH White's version of the King Arthur myth is...unusual. It's not a straight up retelling of the tale that tries to pinpoint any kind of actual date upon when the \"real\" King Arthur lived and base the story in that period. It floats about, taking little bits of history from here, a legend or two from there, and cobbles them together. It makes for an interesting fantasy.It's also distracting. I'm the sort that likes to get immersed in my fantasy. I want to feel like I'm in that world. So, when a ghost knight is questing after a mythical beast and out of nowhere the author is talking about police officers it breaks up my willing suspension of disbelief. Funny, I know, that something that's real should ruin my belief of something fake. It worked so well in Python's \"The Holy Grail\"...Ah, but I'm making too much of this and right from the start of my review. The fact is I really enjoyed The Stone in the Stone. The above gripe is a relatively minor one. For the most part I was able to sit back and enjoy the fantastical scenes, colorful imagery and oddball characters cooked up by White. It's an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink kind of book at times, but you just have to go with it, because of course it would be a kooky life, the adolescence of the man who later drew a sword from a stone in order to become king, referenced water spirits for his life choices and overcame the Knights Who Say Ni with a two letter word and a herring.

White, The Sword in the Stone I loved it and will definitely write more later as I read the follow-ups with the kids. My brats absolutely enjoyed it, even if many of the jokes, the funky blending of the Medieval with the Modern, might have floated a bit over their tiny wee heads. We three (my brood and me) are excited to push forwad and read the rest of The Once and Future King. Anyway, I think White perfectly captured the magic, power, fears and the joy of both youth and myth with this retelling of early Arthurian legend. White's theme of power and justice (\"Might Makes Right\") seem to perfectly capture the political Zeitgiest of now. Perhaps, White like Merlin was just writing through time backwards and wanted to capture the queer contradictions of Imperial Democracy in the global 21st century, but wanted to write it in the 1930s so Disney would be around to animate it in the 60s and thus make his point resonate better in the early 21st century."}, {"userName": "Calista", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16731747-calista", "userReview": "I'll say I really enjoyed parts of this book and I zoned out during other parts of this movie. I'm a huge fan of the Disney cartoon and the characters and scenes they left out for the most part were smart and I didn't miss them.I am glad that I read this classic and I want to finish the Once and future King. There is a lot going on here and much of it is the myth of King Arthur. I feel like this was written for a different time and when it was written it revolutionized the Arthurian Myth. I still love the story of the boy Wart learning from Merlin and not understanding what a gift that is. He got to be animals and learn the lesson of putting yourself in another's shoes and what is life like for them. I think it's a powerful story. I also love love that British Dialect he gave to so many of the characters. It was amazing. Whatever is in the water in Britain gives the people the power of words. I love it. They are so descriptive. I think as an American we have lost a little of that gift as a whole and reduced our language down. I know not everyone. I also love how many times Wart puts the sword back in the stone to prove he can pull it out.

I didn't remember how the narrative voice blended humour and beautiful descriptions, anachronisms and explanations of relatively historically accurate details. I forgot how intertextual it is -- Merlin putting his fingers together like Sherlock Holmes, and all the hints at Lancelot's doings and so on, and Robin Hood...But it is all those things. There are parts of it that are beautiful, parts that are so wonderfully well described, like Wart's time with the geese, or when he's turned into a fish, and the narrative voice is so wonderfully understanding of what goes on inside people's minds. I like the way it treats Kay -- like he's good at heart, but he messes things up by trying too hard to be what he's not, the pride in him. And one of my favourite moments is when Ector says to him that he will always be proud of him, and Kay then decides to tell the truth...So glad I came back to this book.

I finally finished it, and all I really have to say is that I shall not be starting \"The Once and Future King\" any time soon. When I picked up this book up at a library book sale I had such high expectations for the story, which quickly evaporated within the first four chapters. The book was not exactly poorly written (and I've read worse), but the tone of voice conflicts with the overall narration, which prevents the reader from being fully invested in the characters and overarching story. Being part of the Arthurian legend, the fantasy and magic one would expect to find contained within its pages just was not there; as the story seemed to be grappling with too little plot and an author who could not make up his mind about who their audience is. Most of the adventures that Wart went on were both boring and tedious and whilst clever the additions of modern topics such as Eton College, or Nazism seemed asynchronous to the main plot. However it should be noted that as Merlin lives time in reverse order perhaps it does make some sense to have references to a more modern age. Perhaps T.H. White improved the story when he included \"The Sword in the Stone\" as the first part of \"The Once and Future King\", but having looked at the latter book very little of the story seems to have been edited or changed. While one can commend T.H. White for trying the story never came off the page as it should have done. When this book was purchased I was hoping to step into a world of wonder, steeped in the lore of King Arthur, instead the reader is immersed in a book that appears cobbled together and no adventure for Wart has any connection to the chapters that came before it."}, {"userName": "Deborah Pickstone", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37849334-deborah-pickstone", "userReview": "Can you believe I had never read this? As I began it seemed so clearly for children that I was a little put off. Then it occurred to me that I was reading one of the grandparents of modern magical fantasy and very funny in parts, too!

Not to mention it being 'written' in Northern English (Wart rhymes with cart not tort).

I acquired a distaste for T.H. White sometime during my MA, and I'm not sure exactly why: rereading The Sword in the Stone, I still rather loved it, with its gentle humour and the character of the narratorial voice and its understanding of each character. I note that in my first review I noticed the way it treats Kay, which is a good sign for this dissertation...It's written in a conversational way, but it's also beautiful. There are descriptions of the natural world that are almost breathtaking, and Wart can at once be a silly little boy and a very noble one. And Kay can at once be a proud big kid, prone to bullying, and a scared boy who really just wants to hold his own. And Merlyn can be a mysterious wizard and a kindly old man.I'm looking forward to rereading the rest of it now -- although I think the warm sympathy for Kay is less of a thing in the other books, and they're probably not going to be so useful."}, {"userName": "Scott Sheaffer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3203625-scott-sheaffer", "userReview": "This is a great book for anyone into medieval, Arthurian legend.

I read the Time-Life edition. There should be lots of words and terms you've never encountered before. Unless, of course, you are an expert on Norman England, falconry, hunting boars, long-ago dog breeds, tilting, jousting and medieval butchery. I want to label this a quirky fantasy. It's certainly can't be taken seriously. The audience seems to be juvenile, but the language, specifically the terminology, is challenging. (But then, young fantasy fans expect unknown names, kingdoms, objects, etc. to appear in their stories.) And the humor had me laughing out loud. Disney fans know how Wart became Arthur, and that Merlin wears a robe of stars, and all that other Sword in the Stone stuff, and may think it all child's play, but this is not a dumbed down book.

I like Merlin's attitude towards education \"education is experience!\" and the stories where Wart gets turned into animals are cool and philosophical.(Except there is no squirrel story! I was waiting the whole book for a squirrel story and there is none!)The pacing of the book is very good, and you learn a lot of new words from the medieval period. I like how because Merlin has come from the future, he can mention things like cars and stuff like that, there's no time period policing.However - just be warned that this particular edition has not been updated since it was published in 1938. So it still has all sorts of nasty sexist and racist and ableist and classist comments common to that era. In this particular edition, there is the n*word. I just want to mention that because I hate to think of some unsuspecting 9 year old picking it up and then having a very nasty shock right in the middle. (It's the scene when Wart gets turned into a bird) There's also some nasty commentary about barbaric Native Americans, gross imagery of the magic \"Anthropogie\" some of which is based on non-white stereotypes, and stuff like that. Also, plenty of garden variety sexism that women always ruin fun with their chatter and safety concerns and are such wet blankets. Also never as good as men at athletics. (the scene describing Maid Marion is hilarious - every time the author describes something she can do, he makes sure to add a sentence about how Robin Hood does it better) And also a thoughtlessly cruel and ableist description of a boy unable to speak who is kept in a cage. And then you don't know what happens to him, even when you know what happens to the that was kept in the cage next to him. So, yeah, I don't know about other editions, just a warning about the edition with this cover.In an updated book, the story would be quite lovely.

I knew the basic characters like Arthur, Merlin (here Merlyn), Sir Kay, Sir Ector, Lancelot, etc. Many people recommended this book 'The Sword in the Stone' which is the part 1 of the OATFK therefore I took it into consideration and started reading. It was far better and at the same time far worse from my expectations. The book is the classical retelling of the original Arthurian Legends. I thought it would be a serious and a direct story but it had humour, witty dialogues and funny events in it aimed at younger kids but with the language that they wouldn't easily understand, especially the dialogues of personalities like king Pellinore and Merlyns witty philosophy. The book sometimes was truly great with small adventures like Tom Sawyer and sometimes extremely boring (All the parts where Wart \"King Arthur\" is turned into birds and animals by Merlyn) are the most boring. There is no aim and usefulness of this. Apart from this the book is pretty good. The dialogues and the witty humour is the most adorable. I would like to warn anyone who is taking up these books not to keep any expectations or judge it by its covers, I guarantee you that its totally different from what you'd think. White has created controversial characters. Merlyns personality is a lot like Gandalf!(Not Dumbledore). Ectors is like Hatake Kakashi, cool and calm but decisive. Kay is good for nothing bray with a bright future and Wart Aka Arthur is a simple young boy in search for adventures and answers about this world. The book sometimes progresses really slow and sometimes really fast. The worst parts at those when Arthur gets converted into insects and birds by Merlyn as a part of \"Educational Aid.\" Robin Hood is also mentioned here. It focuses in the young age and how he came I be the king. I like the parts when Arthur meets Merlyn, the boar hunt, the Christmas celebration and the teaching classes and I totally hate the transformation parts. They should be erased from the book. I personally think that the last few chapters were a bit rushed. I learned 165 new words from the book. I think children above 13 can read this book as it has some descriptive nature, mind blowing dialogs, boring lectures and lots of fun! Watch out. This is not the usual King Arthur you want. It is a fairly average book and takes around 2 days to read if you really are interested.PlotBook I, \u201cThe Sword and the Stone\u201dWe are introduced to the Wart, a young boy who eventually becomes KingArthur. The Wart grows up in the castle of Sir\u00a0Ector, his foster father. The Wart spends his days in the company of\u00a0Kay, Sir Ector\u2019s son and the heir to his title, amusing himself as best he can while Kay is instructed in the proper ways of knighthood. One night while lost in the forest, the Wart encounters the magician\u00a0Merlyn, a befuddled but powerful old man who announces that he will be the Wart\u2019s tutor. During the next six years, Merlyn tries to instill some of his wisdom in the Wart, teaching him about virtue and the world by turning the Wart into various animals. Finally, Kay is knighted, and the Wart becomes his squire, a kind of servant who assists and attends to his master as the knight travels in search of adventure. When the king of England,Uther Pendragon, dies, he leaves no heir, and it is proclaimed that the next rightful king will be whoever can pull out a mysterious sword that has been driven into a rock. The Wart and Kay travel to London, where a tournament is being held so that the finest knights will have the opportunity to try to remove the sword. While running an errand for Kay, the Wart removes the sword from the stone, and he is declared the next king of England."}, {"userName": "Greg Deane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12449102-greg-deane", "userReview": "This is an amusing work for children, though entertaining for all ages, with a number of interesting mediaeval words, like 'austringer', 'alaunt' 'solar room' and 'fewmets. The novel offers a good many insights into life in feudal households and the unfolding of the seasons in rural England. White gives interesting insights into haymaking, jousting, the path to knighthood and archery But the story is heavy with anachronisms, so that Robin Hood who resisted the tyranny of King John in the 12th and 13th centuries becomes a friend and teacher of Wart who is to become king of England in the fifth century. There are amusing allusions to an electric company and to the Encyclopaedia Britannica and to spectacles worn by King Pellinore and Merlin, though none existed before the 15th century. There is also an excessive reliance on shape changing, so that the Wart becomes a fish, two types of bird and a badger.The book is most valuable for its psychological examination of the preparation of boy for the throne of England, implying that Merlin was divinely appointed to develop and inform Arthur to be king. It may be the book is a justification of the Divine Right of kings to rule, at least at the court of Camelot.However, one serious failing with the book is White's outward insistence that Kay, Arthur's foster brother and eventual seneschal, is essentially a good person. But all the evidence is that Kay is mean, selfish and envious. Otherwise, the book is gently thoughtful though the descriptions of slaughter and killing and violent contests may be troublesome to squeamish parents and teachers who try hard to bowdlerise the writers they approve for their children's reading."}, {"userName": "Samantha ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2060997-samantha", "userReview": "I loved The Sword in the Stone. I watched the Disney movie before I read the novel and I loved that too. However, the book is a lot different from the movie and even though I know the story I still enjoyed it immensely. The book is about a boy named Wart who lives with Sir Ector and his son, Kay, in a castle. Wart never knew his real parents, but Sir Ector treats him like a son and Kay is a brother to him. Wart's adventures begin when he is lost in the woods and stumbles upon the cottage of the wizard Merlyn. Merlyn ends up accompanying the Wart home and becomes his and Kay's tutor. Merlyn makes learning fun for the boys and is an often humorous character; his spells don't alwasys turn out quite right. Wart recieves a special education from Merlyn, gaining lots of knowledge as the wizard turns him into various animals. It seems like the reader is right there with Wart growing up as he goes on countless adventures and meets interesting people. There are wizard duels and talking trees; Robin Wood and his band of merry outlaws; boar hunts and wicked witches. One of my favorite characters was King Pellinore, a goodnatured knight fated to go on a quest after the Beast Glatisant for his whole life. The story is exciting and funny and Wart is a very lovable, human character. I can see why this book is a classic- the themes are universal and anyone can enjoy this.

Often I wasn't sure which 'he' was being referred to, either.

White and his life and sorrows and struggles. A classic of children\u2019s fantasy, The Sword in the Stone is a funny and inventive story of King Arthur\u2019s childhood. It was first published in 1938, but it feels incredibly fresh. Much of the book is made up of a series of set pieces in which Arthur (known as the Wart) is changed into different animals like a fish, a falcon, and a badger, and meets various comic or menacing characters, such as Robin Hood (cleverly disguised as Robin Wood). The underlying idea is that the Wart is being secretly prepared to be king by his tutor, Merlyn. The book abounds in comic anachronisms (ostensibly because Merlyn lives backwards), but it is also filled with acutely observed historical details about medieval times. No attempt has been made to simplify the language, and so one of its joys is the multitude of strange words and terms, which I remember delighting in as a child. A wonderful, strange and memorable fantasy, perfect for any clever child."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl", "userReview": "Because much was cut from the trilogy for the 'fix-it' Once and Future King, including some bits other readers describe that tempt me so much, like food and a duel...._____________Too soon after reading the omnibus to read now, but my comment in the buddy read thread:I found an early (first?) edition in my library system and it's glorious. So much was cut for the omnibus. I don't have time/energy to read it now, but I did skim through the wizard vs. witch duel and that was fun. I love the endaper illustration by Robert Lawson. And the 'decorations' by the author are actually illustrations in their own right, and quite charming. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3329502-stacy", "userReview": "Let me just say that I am REALLY proud of myself for finishing this book. It's very well written and imaginative and descriptive, it's just not at all my genre. ;) So there were some days I had to tell myself, \"Okay, 10 minutes of this book and then you can read whatever you want to read.\" It's on the Ambleside Year 7 list for two of my kids for next year so I wanted to pre-read it, and if I'm going to have them read it, I figured I'd better read it, too. I loved the character of Wart, and Merlyn is a kind and lovable old wizard. The last several pages were excellent. (Some of the other more fantastical scenes will be loved by my Isaac, for sure, and I think I'll have Mark read this one aloud to the older kids.)"}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1421407-janet", "userReview": "One of my very favorite books as a child--what I loved most about it was being transformed into the various animals and other incarnations along with Wart, the future King Arthur. How it felt to be a hawk in the mews...a fish in the moat... the strangeness of becoming a tree, or a mountain, and viewing the world with that change in time perception. Always stayed with me, that feeling, of being a mountain, what the world would look like if you lived so slowly... it truly expanded my life.

In every version that I have loved, I loved it for the romance and the tragedy. Arthur himself I have never connected with, in any version. For me, he has always been too mythical a figure, too chivalrous a hero, too distant a king. Who is Arthur really, but a man amplified or diminished by authorial mercy? TH White takes us back in time to the boy, in that we may know him before his legend. I am not sure I found the King when I met Wart, not even after he drew the sword from the stone and claimed his birthright as Arthur. What I found was a trusting boy with the kindest, most altruistic heart, whom we will eventually lose to his destiny and then to his death. '\u201cIf I were to be made a knight,\" said the Wart, staring dreamily into the fire, \"I should insist on doing my vigil by myself, as Hob does with his hawks, and I should pray to God to let me encounter all the evil in the world in my own person, so that if I conquered there would be none left, and, if I were defeated, I would be the one to suffer for it.\"\"That would be extremely presumptuous of you,\" said Merlyn, \"and you would be conquered, and you would suffer for it.\"\"I shouldn't mind.\"\"Wouldn't you? Wait till it happens and see.\"\"Why do people not think, when they are grown up, as I do when I am young?\"\"Oh dear,\" said Merlyn. '\"You are making me feel confused. Suppose you wait till you are grown up and know the reason?\"\"I don't think that is an answer at all,\" replied the Wart, justly.Merlyn wrung his hands. \"Well, anyway,\" he said, \"suppose they did not let you stand against all the evil in the world?\"\"I could ask,\" said the Wart.\"You could ask,\" repeated Merlyn. He thrust the end of his beard into his mouth, stared tragically into the fire, and began to munch it fiercely.\u201d\u2019But for a prolonged moment, in the short span of this first story in the omnibus *, Wart the child gets to be a child, innocent and free. The Sword in the Stone is not deliberately a children\u2019s book, though it is often thought of as one for its magical whimsy and animal adventures. Which kid could not imagine swimming with the fish as a fish, or slithering with a snake as a snake? With Merlyn\u2019s guidance, Wart lives the best life of a child fully immersed in his world. In that regard, The Sword in the Stone was written wonderfully. Where this eighty-year old classic of medieval telling stands today, so outside of its time in generation, old-fashioned language and sententious tenor, with a modern audience is unclear to me. I find myself caught between trying to embrace it as a child might but finding it aged, or as an adult could but not engaging with the eccentricity, and alas, latched on to neither. I want it to be more serious, to fold me deeper into beautiful language, and to move me as did a few passages but I could not begrudge Wart a carefree, wondrous childhood. On sadness and loss, as the king grows up, I hear these will come in great throes in the books next. Perhaps there, I will finally find Arthur in a version that I can love. [* The Once and Future King omnibus comprises The Sword in the Stone (1938, #1), The Queen of Air and Darkness (1939, #2), The Ill-Made Knight  (1940, #3), The Candle in the Wind  (1958, #4); and a standalone The Book of Merlyn (1941, published 1977, #5)]"}, {"userName": "Thom", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom", "userReview": "This is one of the more famous Arthur stories, and I am fairly sure I saw the Disney film decades ago. It did not make a large impression on me. Certain aspects of the book are very good, and others are far less so.Young \"Wart\" is not descended from nobility like his companion Kay, and the two of them grow up in and around castle life. Only towards the end of the novel is there any potential friction, as Kay starts through his knighthood ceremony, leaving Wart as the squire. The finale of the novel moves far too fast, reducing Wart's moping to a few pages and skipping over Sir Kay's actions completely.Well done was the anachronistic Merlyn. The comedy in his comments feels timeless, even though the novel was written several decades ago. He also introduces Wart to experiences that will make him the well-rounded King Arthur of legend. These experiences culminate in the strength to pull the Sword from the Stone.The novel has several passages of characters delivering long diatribes about various topics, some religious and some otherwise. These detract from the main narrative and increase the difficulty of reading. I can\u2019t say whether this is the style of T.H. White or the mode of the time, but I didn\u2019t enjoy it.I went into this novel thinking of it as a young adult novel, or perhaps even a children's book, ala Disney's interpretation. What I found would be difficult for most kids to understand or even for many adults to explain. While I enjoyed the very good bits, this novel (and probably the series) are not especially recommended."}], "description": "T.H.
