I would like to thank the author for this book. I really liked this book. If you like re-tellings of old fairy tales then you will probably like this one. It has a little bit of magic, romance, crazy psycho killer, all in a quaint little town called Lobster Cove. Charlotte comes to Lobster Cove to be with her sister Annabel after Charlotte gets let go from her job. She's able to still work from home through networking and told Annabel she would give her a month to see if she wants to live there forever. I will be adding a few *SPOILERS*Charlotte goes into a clothing store called, \"One Enchanted Evening\" There is a creepy old lady there that tells her to choose a wardrobe to open. Charlotte thinks this lady is a freak and just wants to get out of there. The lady talks Charlotte into trying to open wardrobes until one actually opens and hanging there is Red Riding Hoods cloak! The lady mumbles some stuff about the hood picking Charlotte and she just basically says whatever and leaves the place. Finding out later the hood can move on it's own and pulls itself down over Charlotte's eyes and writes to her. The cloak calls itself the Red Writing Hood. I know it sounds corny but it really isn't. Anyway, so Charlotte has to find a man dressed in a wolf mask killing people and take him out of the game. She gets help from a nice war veteran named Luke who runs an organic shop. He makes different things from his grandmother's old recipes. Eventually they get the killer and a little surprise ending that I thought was great. I hope there will be more on this little town!

Kelley is a 2014 Wild Rose Press publication. I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Touted as a modern day spin on the Little Red Riding Hood fairytale, this book piqued my interest since I am always keeping my eyes open for something a little off the beat path. Charlotte is at loose ends and has promised her sister she would stick around Lobster Cove, Maine for at least a month and will try to keep her mind open to the possibility of settling down there. But, the sleepy community has some oddities, one of which is a consignment shop that seems to make it's own hours. When Charlotte's sister wrangles an invitation to a Halloween costume party for Charlotte, the consignment shop is the best place to look for a last minute costume. Who would ever have thought the red cape Charlotte ended up with would be enchanted.Luke is an ex- military guy with a few war scars, and disabilities he hides quite well. When he and Charlotte interrupt a horrific attack they soon discover they have been chosen to discover the identity of a \u201cwolf\u201d who was responsible the first attack, and will most certainly attack again. The red cape becomes their partner as it whispers inside information to Charlotte as she and Luke try to flush out the \u201cWolf\u201d. Well, if it's an imaginative tale you seek, then this one is what you are looking for. A mystery thriller with a paranormal element, which parallels with the Red Riding Hood story. The killer's identity and the reasons behind the attacks were not the book's strong suit. I don't know why I didn't really get the Wolf part of things, but I suppose the wolf was simply a whack job or there was some sort of symbolism involved which I didn't latch onto, or maybe the reasoning was not meant to be a big puzzle to solve. What I did like was the whimsical aspects of the story and I was happy to see Charlotte find a place to hang her hat, a love interest, and apparently a new purpose. This story is certainly different, and I would recommend keeping your mind open when you start reading this one. Since I don't normally read anything along these lines I was not sure what rating to settle on, but since the story was so unique I think I will go with 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Joy D.

It reminded me of an ABC Family movie or the show Once Upon a Time. The retelling of Little Red Riding Hood is great and the characters are very easy to relate too. Even though the majority of this book isn't to dark, there were moments that were dark and added an edge to the story that I really enjoyed. The mystery, love story and horror parts all intertwine wonderful making this a quick and easy read. This book isn't long so it would be a perfect read for a Saturday cuddled up with some coco. If you are a fan of fairy tales, like a good mystery or a love story, you will thoroughly enjoy this book! Charlotte is a great character to follow and you will be done with this book before you even put it down!"}, {"userName": "L.J.

That being said, the story line is very imaginative, it moves along well, caught my interest right away, and has great characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and read through it rapidly, despite having a very busy weekend (helping a daughter move, and celebrating the birthdays of two others!).

This week, we dip into the paranormal romance basket to find a bit of modern fairy tale fare with One Enchanted Evening. Will this basket of goodies end our local feast on a high note or will this evening be not so enchanted after all?Before we slip on our red hoods, let us recite the Starving Reviewer\u2019s creed:1. I attempt to rate every book from the perspective of a fan of the genre2. I attempt to make every review as spoiler-free as possibleIt\u2019s not a groundbreaking recipe idea to mine the fairy tales of old for inspiration. Whether such a meal turns out tasting fresh and zesty or old and rehashed comes down to the new ingredients and substitutions the chef makes. So the first critical matter to deal with is whether Evening is the first, the second, or something simply \u2018meh\u2019 in between. I\u2019m happy to tell you that this meal is much more of the first, with no real bits of the second or the third, really.Evening is a breezy and even-paced read, drawing inspiration from the classic tale of Red Riding Hood, while turning it well on its head. There is a witty pun or two involved, but the core of the matter is actually a very serious one, delving into thwarting wolves in their hunt. As the narrative is set in modern Maine, let it be plain that the hunting wolf here is not an animal. In essence, we have a paranormal romance crime fairy tale here.The characters are smartly written and the supernatural elements are thought out and follow a logical form. Solid writing and a crisp, even pace make Evening a pleasant meal to down. While the actual plot isn\u2019t a revolutionary, palate-expanding meal, it\u2019s good and simple, with a capable heroine who is a step outside the typical romance-genre lead, a fairly deep male lead (there are some good parts exploring the mindset of a war veteran here), and an appropriately wicked villain. Combined with a well-written romance and a few capable action scenes, the meal concludes with a note of positivity wrapped in mystery.In summation, One Enchanted Evening is a crispy, airy pastry of paranormal romance with a tasty hint of drama and action. It isn\u2019t anything extremely deep or groundbreaking, but I would heartily recommend it to someone wanting a fun romantic novel with a splash of the paranormal and dramatic. If you\u2019re looking for a book that tackles \u2018deep issues\u2019 or something highly action-oriented, you would be best served elsewhere.FINAL VERDICT: **** (A crispy, airy pastry of paranormal romance with a tasty hint of drama and action!)"}, {"userName": "Merissa (Archaeolibrarian)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10258612-merissa-archaeolibrarian", "userReview": "I received this book from the author in return for a fair and honest review.This is a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood that had me smiling, if not laughing out loud, through most of the story. It starts with Charlotte having some sloppy joe time in her apartment until her sister shows up and bullies her to come out with her. Whilst they are out, they come across a consignment clothes shop with a very strange owner.Moving on and through circumstances beyond her control, Charlotte finds herself back at the consignment shop one evening and the owner helps her but in a very mysterious and cryptic way. She is given, or is chosen by, the Red Writing Hood which will help her and the village.Charlotte doesn't really understand any of what is going on but decides to go along with it for now. Little does she know that she's now walking a different path and one with danger on it.This is a brilliant story that had me laughing with the humorous way it is written, as well as worrying for Charlotte, Luke and 'other' women as the wolf starts to play his game. The characters are completely believable, the situations well written and the plot is fast-paced but solid.A book to be savored and enjoyed. Highly recommended for all."}, {"userName": "Debbie Ament", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13663000-debbie-ament", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book. It is a quick read with characters that are easy to relate to. The typical stereotypes are reversed; handsome hunk owns a small shop and sells herbs and spice packets from his grandma\u2019s secret recipes. Cute new girl in town has itchy feet and can\u2019t seem to settle in one place. Add one enchanted cloak, and a really, really bad guy and you have a modern twist of a old fairy tale.

The heroine finds a wellspring of courage she didn't know she had. The hero discovers disability doesn\u2019t equal weakness. The villain\u2014well, he\u2019s just plain rotten. Meanwhile, the reader will never look at a clothing from a consignment shop the same way again. Blurb:Enchanted clothing has a mind of its own.Restlessness plagued Charlotte Becker. Unable to settle down, she moved from place to place searching for an elusive something to calm her turbulent spirit. A sudden invitation from her sister sends her across country to Lobster Cove, Maine. Anchors abound by the sea, but surely nothing would keep her rooted in place in a pokey resort town during the off-season.Drawn into a consignment shop named One Enchanted Evening, Charlotte is confronted by a mysterious article of clothing requesting her help to stop a man in a wolf mask from killing women. Charlotte agrees to protect the citizens of Lobster Cove and find the hunter before an innocent is slain.Luke Maddox\u2019s hunting days are over. Wounded in action, he left the Marines to return to Lobster Cove, the only place to bring him peace as a child. Hiding his disability, he accepts life will be nothing more than dull routine. Then he meets a singular young woman wearing an unusual cloak. She tells an incredible story of a wolf that walks on two legs.And the hunt begins\u2026Excerpt:The woman\u2019s gaze raked over Charlotte. Sharp brown eyes caught her in an unblinking stare.\u201cUm, hi,\u201d said Charlotte, suddenly feeling as if she had walked out of her apartment without pants. Unconsciously, she ran a hand down her side, and was relieved to touch denim.\u201cOh? A consignment shop?\u201d chirped Annabel. \u201cPerhaps we could look around. My sister and I love vintage wear,\u201d she added with her winning smile. Charlotte rolled her eyes. Annabel never gave up easily. She\u2019d have that woman arm-wrestling over a price for the armoire before she could say interior designer discount.\u201cYour life is complete, Mrs. Fisher,\u201d said the shop owner pleasantly. \u201cNothing in here would fit.\u201d Amused, Charlotte for once noted Annabel at a complete loss for words.The coins on the woman\u2019s scarf jangled as her head swung toward her. Charlotte swallowed hard as the pantsless feeling crept up her legs again. \u201cYou have possibilities,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThe path traveled can be diverted. Come back when you\u2019re ready to accept the consequences. I warn you, though; the first step to fulfilling one\u2019s destiny can be dangerous. Good day.\u201d She shut the door in their faces.Annabel gawked at the building. \u201cHelluva way to run a business. She\u2019s not going to last long in Lobster Cove with that attitude.\u201d She slipped her arm into Charlotte\u2019s. \u201cCome on, I know a fabulous little place around the corner that sells dynamite shoes.\u201dAs Charlotte allowed herself to be led away, she glanced back over her shoulder. The curtains were still closed. The shop appeared as vacant as before, but she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that behind one of those obscured windows stood a little old lady peering intently in her direction.", "title": "One Enchanted Evening", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23251933-one-enchanted-evening", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411149541l/23251933.jpg", "reviews": 9, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7243546.L_A_Kelley", "name": "L.A.
