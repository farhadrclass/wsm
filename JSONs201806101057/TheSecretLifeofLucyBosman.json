It captured my attention, and made me want to read the synopsis to see what the book was about. When I saw that it was historical fiction, my heart skipped a beat, because that's one of my favorite genres.I was very quickly drawn up into the story of Lucy Bosman; Lucy tells her story in a rich, colorful way that makes you feel as if you're standing right next to her, seeing everything as she sees it. There are characters you will quickly fall in love with, some that will break your heart, and others that you want to kick in the tail. (My heart is still crying at what happened to Wilhemina). The story flows well, and you find yourself rooting for Lucy, who is very courageous, even in the face of adversity. To be honest, I didn't want this book to end, and I'm hoping that there will be a continuation, as I'm curious to find out what happens to Lucy. Author Rebekah Pierce has weaved a masterful tale of a woman who succeeded against enormous odds, and became a trailblazer in a time when a woman was expected to sit in the background and raise a family. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a positive, well-written story, I guarantee you'll love it as much as I did!"}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20921074-melinda", "userReview": "I received a free copy through Goodreads.---It was an interesting and insightful read. Slavery and racism, it was so wide spread in southern US during that time period. This story gave a glimpse as to what people, most notably the African Americans, went through and the struggles it took before they were finally 'freed'. Lucy Bosman, is definitely a feisty and determined young woman, who will let nothing stop her from her dreams. However, she has a secret, she is a mulatto who has much to lose shall anyone find out her secret. But along the way, she finds and makes great relationships with those around her (ok Sarah not so much, since she is all for herself). Lucy was truly an inspiration, then and even now by today's standards. Three things that need improvement on: 1. there were a few minor spelling errors that kind of bothered me, especially since I was rather engrossed with the story. 2. I wish the ending had a little more umph to it, while yes it was left very optimistic, it was a little bit of a let down compared to the rest of the story. 3. Lucy bounces between being a confident woman to a scared woman. Yes, I understand during that difficult time, Lucy struggled to understand and come to terms the extent of slavery and racism and she was still going through the traumatic loss of Charles but it's the feisty aura about her that captured people's attention, so would have loved to seen it a little more."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1483301-diane", "userReview": "Rebekah L. Pierce did an awesome job of portraying the life of a mulatto woman, Lucy Bosman, in the 1800's, especially when she looks white. Lucy was born a slave but received her freedom when she married her beloved Charles. They owned a farm and both worked very hard on it until Charles' death. Lucy inherits a building in Richmond and makes a journey to claim it. The reader is pulled into Lucy's life and feels her hope, her ambitions and the fear she lives in every day. The fear that she will be discovered as a 'nigger' and dealt with as such as they did in those times. It doesn't matter what she looks like......it doesn't matter that she has dreams, aspirations, courage and more. Then the war breaks out and people are in a frenzy and Richmond seems to be in the middle of it. Lucy was in fear before and now it escalates. Kudos to Ms. Pierce for writing a historical novel that encompasses the plight of not only Lucy but blacks during this time. It is an emotionally charged story about a true heroine. If you like history or historical fiction this is a must read!For more information about Rebekah L. Pierce check here: http://rebekahlpierce.com/DISCLAIMER: I am not using the word \"nigger\" in a derogatory sense at all. This is the word the author used and the word of the times(pre civil war).

It completely captured my attention and held it for the duration of the story. It captured it so well in fact, that when I reached the end of the book I was left wanting more. I want to hear more about Lucy\u2019s youth, her courtship and marriage, and especially where she ended up after the last page of this part of her story was told. Lucy is just one of those characters you find yourself caring for deeply and the author did an amazing job of creating this connection between character and reader.More please."}, {"userName": "Lizzie Winns", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25994349-lizzie-winns", "userReview": "This book was written in the slavery days. Right before the emancipation proclamation ended slavery. I really enjoyed this book, It made me feel all sorts of way, first I felt pain, pain for Lucy as a child, and pain for Lucy as an adult. Lucy was a black woman pretending to be white. She also married a white man who knew her secret. Lucy had to be careful as a white woman and a black woman. She hid her secret but it seemed like she only fooled the white people not the black folks... She also lost a few loved ones through racial discrimination... But in the end things kinda worked out for Lucy, it wasn't a happily ever after type book. But I loved it nevertheless."}, {"userName": "Anne Marie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18314034-anne-marie", "userReview": "Wonderful..

Lucy Bosman is a shrewd business woman in a day and time not too amenable to the dreams and desires of women - especially colored women.

Two years later, Lucy is planted firmly in Richmond, Virginia, running a successful business while passing as a white woman and avoiding the personal attentions and promises of love by plantation owner, Thomas Parker. She has managed to keep her identity a secret from the town and Thomas, but the looming Civil War threatens to change everything. In The Secret Life of Lucy Bosman, nothing is safe from the destruction of war and secrets.
