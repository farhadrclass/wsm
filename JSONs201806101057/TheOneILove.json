So glad to be done with this one. I only finished it because I wanted to see what would happen. It was by an Irish writer...about a woman who disappears and various people who are trying to find her...I didn't particularly like the characters--most of them didn't seem to have any morals--and in fact I didn't feel as if I really got to understand them at any rate. The writing was just not very strong.This novel is a classic example of telling rather than showing. And even though I love music, the Jack Lukeman theme felt completely forced and hollow.

I have read her other books and have loved them all, consuming them quickly even when there were things I told myself I'd get done before I continued. Alexandra Gone is no exception. Jane cares for everyone except herself, Elle straddles the line between being ridiculously selfish and having emotional illness, Tom is likable even when he's doing things that are wrong, and Leslie is so relatable (Is that a word? Maybe not.) as a person hiding from her life that you can't help but love them along with all of the other secondary characters.The book starts out with us missing Alexandra and you wonder what happened to her. Is she dead? Has something happened? Did she just decide one day to disappear and leave her life behind? Haven't we all considered it at least once? And then you realize that even though it does matter to all of these people what happened to her, it's not the real goal of the book to find out.This book has everything I was looking for, with just a little bit of mystery, some fun, some drama, some insanity, and all of it in one book just like life. But it doesn't get too dark or to difficult to make it through. Fans of Cecelia Ahern will love Anna McPartlin. I can't wait for a new one from her.http://vancie917.wordpress.com/"}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2196362-colleen", "userReview": "Alexandra, Goneby Anna McPartlin opens with the disappearance of Alexandra one afternoon in Dublin. The reader knows little about her but witnesses her disappearance and the subsequent devastation of her husband, Tom, and her family as they desperately hold out hope that she will be found healthy and safe. While looking for Alexandra, Tom has a chance meeting in a broken elevator with Leslie, Elle and Elle's sister, Jane. The four soon band together in the search for Alexandra and through that process come to know each other and to share their personal tragedies.Each of the four main characters has their own storyline:Jane is raising her teenage son alone but still loves her son's father, her teenage sweetheart. She is the matriarch of her family and takes responsibility for not only her sister Elle's career but the rest of life too - she manages her money, provides her with a home and is the rock upon which Elle relies. In addition to Elle, Jane is responsible for their alcoholic mother who lives with her and is prone to rude outbursts.Elle is the boisterous and unpredictable artist who makes unwise decisions in love and tends to live life in extremes - she is very much the opposite of Jane but their love and affection for each other is clear.Leslie is the solitary remaining living member of her family - cancer has ravaged the family's gene pool and she has lost both parents and two sisters to the disease. She knows she has the faulty gene that led to the early demise of her sisters due to ovarian or breast cancer and she essentially shuts down, closes herself off from people and relationships while she waits for her inevitable diagnosis and early death.Tom is devastated by his young wife's disappearance and his life slowly unravels after she goes missing. His relationship with his in-laws is strained as many of them blame him for her disappearance; as a result, he finds himself increasingly alone in his search for his wife and his desperation until he is trapped in the elevator with the three women who sign on for his search and rally around him.The story is essentially told around the absence of Alexandra - we learn very little about her throughout the novel and the real revelations are in the lives of the four main characters who are tied together in their search for Alexandra. At some point, I found myself almost forgetting about Alexandra as I became more and more drawn into the stories of the four main characters. Because the story is told from the points of view of these four main characters (with a few other minor ones thrown in for good measure), the novel seemed a little choppy to me in the beginning - I felt as if I barely knew any character well enough to care about them and kept wondering when I would learn more about Alexandra. But once I realized that the book was really not about Alexandra and the stories behind each of the four main characters began to unfold, I found I could not put the book down! In the last third of the novel, the revelations come fast and furious for each of the four main characters. Their stories were often very emotional as they dealt with histories of mental illness, sacrificed dreams and the loss of loved ones. I definitely shed a tear or two in the last part of the book.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel - even though some of the themes are quite heavy (death, loss, mental illness), the author infuses the dialogue with humor and quips which helps to lighten the mood of the novel. I am now eager to move onto the other novels by the author currently on my shelf - Pack Up the Moon,Apart from the Crowd, and As Sure As the Sun."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Defoy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1613620-jennifer-defoy", "userReview": "I really liked this book. The title would suggest that it is about Alexandra, and it is to an extent. But the real story involves the other characters and what they go through while trying to find Alexandra. Really the character Alexandra is just a catalyst to pull all of the other characters together. Not to say that Alexandra isn't part of the plot, because the entire book revolves around finding her, but she's not part of the main stories. This book reminded me a bit of a Maeve Binchy novel. Even before I read the author bio, and realized that McPartlin also lives in Ireland. I guess it's a similarity in Irish authors, but luckily Maeve Binchy is one of my favorite authors so being similar to one of her books is a good thing (at least in my opinion). The writing is similar and the dialect is the same. While this story doesn't have a Binchy style happy ending it is still very similar. There was really only one character that I connected with, and that was Leslie. I too have lost family to cancer, and like Leslie am scared every time I go to the doctor that they will find something. Even though I didn't really have a personal connection with the rest of the characters I still liked every one of them. Jane is the levelheaded one. She keeps everyone else \"in line\" so to speak. Elle is the one that adds drama and excitement to the story. Tom is the one we all want to feel sympathetic for. The rest of the characters help the plot along, but I didn't really feel anything for them. They were just kind of there. The writing was very good. It was humorous, touching, and romantic. Everything in the story was believable. I didn't feel as if any of the characters were fake, and the dialog was real. There were a few twists that I didn't see coming. And while I knew how the story would end I didn't expect it to take the path it took to get there. Overall this was a great book. I liked the characters, the plot, and the writing. It's very readable, and I think I could read this again."}, {"userName": "S\u00f3nia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10423285-s-nia", "userReview": "Anna McPartlin \u00e9 conhecida por escrever livros de leitura flu\u00edda, mas que nos possibilitam uma reflex\u00e3o sobre v\u00e1rios pormenores mais s\u00e9rios.

But when Jane got pregnant at seventeen, they drifted apart. Seventeen years later, Jane discovers Alexandra has disappeared and she sets about helping Alexandra\u2019s broken-hearted husband, Tom, to find his wife. But in searching for Alexandra Jane is about to confront some big questions about herself. Like, what happened to the high-spirited seventeen-year-old she once was? What will happen if she stops trying to control the world? And does love really mean letting people go? Two fractured people come together accidentally and in one another they find strength, friendship \u2013 and even the beginnings of hope \u2026**Please note that this book is also titled So What If I\u2019m Broken and Alexandra, Gone!**When I read Anna McPartlin\u2019s debut novel Pack up the Moon earlier this year I was so thankful that I had spotted the cover while browsing Google because otherwise I never would have bought the book because I would never have known it existed. I thought Pack up the Moon was stunning, it really blew me away and I quickly collected up the rest of Anna\u2019s books. I managed to get myself a copy of her latest book The One I Love (also known as Alexandra, Gone and So What If I\u2019m Broken?) to review and I started it fully expecting another cracking read and I wasn\u2019t disappointed at all.At the beginning of The One I Love, the entire Chapter One in fact, we\u2019re introduced to numerous characters; there\u2019s Alexandra, who after writing a note to husband Tom sets off to meet her friend but disappears on route, we meet Elle and Jane who are friends of Alexandra and who are sisters, Elle likes to write letters to the Universe whereas Jane has found herself pregnant at 17, we then meet Leslie, who we learn is cut off from all of her family and friends due to a genetic gene and then finally, we meet Tom, Alexandra\u2019s husband as he sets about trying to find his wife. It\u2019s complete chaos, ranging from 1989 to 1996, to the present day of 2007, told in letter forms and flashbacks, and I was a bit concerned the book would carry on that way. But after setting out the storyline by introducing us to the main characters, and their problems, we then stay in 2007 and the story progresses from there like a proper story should as they try to find Alexandra.The plot truly is fantastic, because although the basis for the entire plot is Alexandra being missing and Tom\u2019s search to find her, we also learn about Tom, Jane, Elle and Leslie. After meeting at a Jack Lukeman concert, they got stuck in the lift, they all band together to search for Alexandra but they also become friends as well. Yet they all have their own problems: Jane is still in love with her son Kurt\u2019s dad Dominic, Elle has deep-set issues with the world, Leslie lives her life under a cloud, constantly being hounded by a gene that has harmed other family members and Tom is just looking for his wife. As they all try to come to terms with their problems, and learn new secrets, and start new relationships you really begin to care about each and every one of them, and I was turning the pages avidly, desperate to carry on reading.There is no main or lead character in the novel, that\u2019s shared by Jane, Tom, Elle and Leslie and each have their own quirks and foibles that make them their own. I liked them all equally and found them all incredibly well rounded. But what I liked best was that they were all so human. They each made mistakes throughout the novel, little ones, big ones, and for me it just made me like them all the more. Jane was the most family-oriented, looking after her son Kurt as well as her aging, drunk mother Rose and flighty sister Elle, and always put them before herself. Elle, as I\u2019ve said, was flighty and impulsive and a bit of a wild child, and she spoke to me the most I think (for the record, I am nothing like Elle). Leslie was shy, staying alone and away from the world, until her encounter in the lift when she finally decided it was time to stop living like a hermit. And Tom, Tom was brave, when many people would have just left Alexandra for dead, Tom carried on looking for her and I totally admired that in him. He had heart and spirit. In fact, they all had heart and spirit. There are many other, minor, characters in the novel. Rose, Elle and Jane\u2019s spiky mother, Kurt, Jane\u2019s teenage son, Alexandra\u2019s family, her parents and siblings, Leslie\u2019s sister\u2019s widow Jim, they all made their mark and none more so than Alexandra herself. Alexandra herself is in four pages total, but the book is infinitely her. From the memories Jane has of her, to Tom\u2019s memories, her families memories, she just shines off the pages and despite not really knowing her, we do care for her. I\u2019ve no idea how McPartlin pulled that off, but she did, and for me, Alexandra was utterly real.The One I Love is about a lot of things, but the main thing that will stay with me is written on the front of the book: that no matter what, true friends will not give up and that encompasses the book perfectly. Not only that, but the feeling I got of how each of the characters found themselves, it was immense. McPartlin has pulled off another stunning novel, and for me she ranks up there with Marian Keyes and Melissa Hill in terms of how well she writes and how good she is at crafting a story. The book is told in third-person, moving from Jane to Elle to Leslie to Tom, which works fantastically well and I never got lost off despite there being so much going on. I adored the book, and Anna is two for two with me so far and I look forward to getting stuck into her other two novels. I sincerely hope she\u2019s working on another novel \u2013 and many other novels in the future \u2013 as she\u2019s definitely an author you want to be reading. She may not be huge in the UK, I can\u2019t really speak for Ireland, but she deserves to be. I am a huge fan."}, {"userName": "Mariazita", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5368409-mariazita", "userReview": "Gosto muito desta autora, os seus livros s\u00e3o sempre muito emotivos .Mais um livro com diferentes personagens, cada uma com um problema , e as suas maneiras de os superarem.Tudo come\u00e7a com o desaparecimento de Alexandra, Tom o seu marido tenta encontra-la desesperadamente, nessa procura por um mero acaso encontra Jane, uma amiga de inf\u00e2ncia de Alexandra, a qual n\u00e3o a via a dezassete anos, desde que ainda adolescente engravidou .Jane al\u00e9m de criar o seu filho, tem que ajudar a sua irm\u00e3 Elle, que tem uma maneira ca\u00f3tica de viver, e ainda a sua m\u00e3e Rose, que vive na cave da sua casa e tem um problema de alcoolismo.Leslie junta-se a estes na procura de Alexandra , mas Leslie tamb\u00e9m tem um verdadeiro drama pessoal, \u00e9 portadora do mesmo gene que matou toda a sua fam\u00edlia , cancro.E \u00e9 com esta dram\u00e1ticas hist\u00f3rias que este livro cativou-me, e ainda assim existe um toque de humor nas personagens que deixam todos estes dramas mais leves de ler.Muito bom."}, {"userName": "Carla Faleiro", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3656994-carla-faleiro", "userReview": "Sabe, quem passou pela experi\u00eancia, que perder algu\u00e9m \u00e9 algo que nos deixa no limite.

Jane Moore was once her best friend, but like a lot of friendships, life and events saw them separate. A chance meeting at a concert brings Alexandra's husband into contact with Jane, Jane's sister Elle & Leslie. After being trapped together in a lift, they decide they will help Tom to try and find Alexandra. Elle is a loose cannon, a liability but a fantastic artist who has many demons she needs to address. Leslie has lost so many of her family to cancer, she tested for the gene and has decided the best way to be safe is to keep a distance from people & family. This chance meeting will see them all come together and in helping Tom expose themselves to friendship and self exploration and personal growth.There is a lot about this story I liked, when someone disappears you want to know what has happened. Relationships forming and learning more about the characters, some happiness, some sadness and some laughter in between. People coming together, growth of characters and vesting interest is always a great art created by some very talented authors. What didn't I like? There are themes of infidelity, some codes broken that as friends and or family you just wouldn't do, lines you do not cross. However, in saying that, it does happen and brings realism to the story, I still personally do not like it.Yet another good tale by McPartlin, I enjoy meeting and following the characters she creates. I really wanted to know what happened to Alexandra and getting to know the characters followed secondary to that. Once the story got kick started, you find yourself being drawn in and not wanting to put the book down so you can find where their paths are going. 3/5 for me this time, I will continue to buy up this authors work although my favourite still remains, The Last Days Of Rabbit Hayes."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490212-cheryl", "userReview": "Alexandra, Gone by Anna McPartlinPublished by Downtown Press (Division of Simon & Schuster)ISBN 978-1-4391-2333-1At the request of Gallery & Pocket Books, a PB copy was sent, at no cost to me, for my honest opinion.

My Thoughts and Opinion: Most books I read, I can't wait to finish it to find out the ending. I was totally ambivalent with this one. I hated to see it end, but then I also wanted to see how it did end. I don't know about you, but, I become part of the story in which I am reading. That is why I didn't want to turn the last page because I became friends with the characters of this book. In Alexandra, Gone, the author writes a story of the lives of many loveable, but at times, troubled characters. I found myself laughing out loud on one page, eyes filling with tears on another, and frustrated with them on yet another. Ms. McPartlin tells a tender, funny, poignant and moving story of friendship, loss, disappointment, pain, denial and love on so many levels. This book is the type of book that you get so engrossed while reading that you are unaware of what is going on around you, at least that is what happened to me. I highly recommend reading Alexandra, Gone and becoming friends with Jane, Elle, Leslie and all the other characters.

Jane turned her life around and made a success of it and she's strong and a fighter though her weakness is her sons father,Dominic who basically has been using her for sex.I never much liked Elle, she's a grown woman who acts like a child and her sister excuses all her mistakes and pats her on the head n says it's okay. Elle was really irritating and eventually we find out why she is like this and when she does the unthinkable but I couldn't feel any sympathy for her.Jane forgives her the unthinkable and that really annoyed me as if they were making excuses for this illness she has so let her away with anything.Leslie started off as a real sad lonely character and gradually changed throughout the story into a much nicer person.It's obvious from the start in a way how her story is going to end and even though it's nice for her after everything she has been through,it just didn't sit right with me,felt wrong somehow.My favourite was Rose, the alcoholic mother of Jane and Elle. She was so funny and the things she would come out with,I would go back n read them just to laugh again.The book was actually really funny in places,the humour was pretty evident throughout which lightened some darker times and scenes.There were some little surprises threw in that rocked things up at times,some sad moments that you weren't expecting, but all these things add to the story in a good way.I really enjoyed this book for its humour,characters and great plot."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2698688-jennifer", "userReview": "From my blog...[return][return]Alexandra, Gone is a brilliantly stunning novel that showcases the masterful storytelling of author Anna McPartlin where readers learn just enough about the key cast to have their interest piqued. The novel begins with Alexandra's narrative on 21 June 2007 in Dublin where she left a note for her husband Tom to head to the grocery when he returned home from work and said she would be out for a brief time while having drinks with her friend Sherri. Alexandra departed the train in Dalkey, and then she completely vanished. Back in 1989, then 8 year-old Elle Moore began a tradition of spending New Year's Eve writing a letter to the Universe. By May of 1990 we learn that Jane Moore, Elle's 17-year old sister is pregnant and she has turned to her friend Alexandra for help. Jane gave birth to a baby boy, Kurt, and 4 months later Alexandra was gone from the Moore girls lives. In 1996 Imelda writes a letter to her husband Jim, imploring him to look after Leslie when she is gone, for Leslie will be left with no family once she succumbs to cancer. Which brings the reader up to present day with Tom Kavanagh pleading on a radio station for any information or leads that may help find his wife. Jim decides to hand out leaflets at a concert and finds himself trapped in a lift with Elle and Jane Moore and Leslie Sheehan. Elle and Jane are shocked to see a picture of their friend all these years later and stunned to her of her disappearance. The four make a pact to find out the truth of Alexandra's disappearance. McPartlin tells the story through the different voices of Elle, Jane, Leslie, and Tom, each with their unique viewpoints. The characters in Alexandra, Gone are vibrant, flawed, dysfunctional and deal with very serious issues, yet the book does not come across as either too heavy or depressing, rather the story is quite cleverly interwoven. Ingeniously, McPartlin tells the story of not merely a missing woman, but of families, friends, and friends who become family.

When an elevator breaks down she finds herself with Alexandra's husband Tom and ends up helping, along with Leslie (a fellow passenger in the elevator who has demons of her own) in the campaign to find what happened to Alexandra.Tom has done whatever was needed to try to help find his wife to no avail. His in-laws have had a tough time with their daughters disappearance but go on with their daily lives the best they can.This is a story of love and loss,new friendships and old, and how family dynamics can affect each member of that family. Underneath this often downright funny novel is the dark shadow of what really happened to Alexandra, (this would be a spoiler so I won't say).This was a fast read and I enjoyed it very much."}, {"userName": "Helen F", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17304055-helen-f", "userReview": "(Note: I read the edition titled The One I Love.

Reading the blurb, I had expected the book to be dark and with a greater focus on forensics because of Alexandra's disappearance. Instead, I entered this world of Jane, her sister Elle, their friend Leslie, their new friend Tom, and the rest of Jane's off-kilter family. Getting to know these people, what and who they love, their vulnerabilities and hopes, and their stories and strengths was full of laughs and surprises.In Jane, Elle, and Leslie of Alexandra, Gone, Anna McPartlin created such warm, witty, and fleshed out characters that the book reminded me of close friends that I miss. Despite the tragedies that occur, the book celebrates life and friendship. I highly recommend Alexandra, Gone to someone looking for a witty, unusual, and upbeat read.

I would have been irritated if we wouldn\u00b4t have gotten the solution to the disappearance. What did bother me was the conjunction `and`.

This was such a good story. Alexandra is indeed gone, disappeared one afternoon never to be seen again and the story is about the people who come together - accidentally, to try to help find her. Her husband Tom has never stopped looking for her and with the help of her oldest childhood friend and others, a new search unfolds as does the complex story of interwoven lives of real people. Despite the subject matter, this book is not a dark and depressing story, but instead one filled with humour, mad, funny moments, eccentric people and love. The love of family and friends.

The title would suggest that it is about Alexandra, and it is to an extent. But the real story involves the other characters and what they go through while trying to find Alexandra. Really the character Alexandra is just a catalyst to pull all of the other characters together. Not to say that Alexandra isn't part of the plot, because the entire book revolves around finding her, but she's not part of the main stories. A good story with a mix of characters and there lives.

There are some fairly dark parts about death, loss, mental illness, alcoholism and betrayal, but also some very funny bits.

Well, she did! The characters have depth and make you care that Alexandra is missing. You get to know her through the interactions of Jane, Leslie, Elle and Tom. McPartlin shines with her smart and funny dialogue and that earns extra points with me as a reader. There are a lot of emotional roller coasters hereand there are points at which you might be driven to tears, but the ending is worth it. I can't wait for her next release.
