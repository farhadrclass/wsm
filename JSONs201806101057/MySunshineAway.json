Walsh has written an ode to the power of memory, a beautiful examination of the balance between regret and hope. This novel is about the moments in our lives that hang with us, memories that follow us like ghosts. It's about the choices we make when the stakes are the highest, what we choose to do and what we choose not to, and in that sense, it is simply about being human."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "\u201cI want to rely on my memory.

The story is told from the point of view of a grown man looking back 20 years, describing the story through the eyes of himself as a hormonal, love struck teen. There is a horrible event that happens early in the book and then it meanders until the very end when a lackluster \"surprise\" reveal is supposed to shock the reader. Unfortunately, no amount of reveal would have rectified reading page upon page of musings by an uninteresting, unlikeable kid surrounded by boring, cardboard characters. And what the critics described as the author's ability to bring us back to the 1980s, to see and feel them was actually just a detour to discuss the Challenger disaster and two hurricanes that hit New Orleans but affected Baton Rouge, the setting in the book. Pages and pages were devoted to the heavy traffic, influx of refugees from New Orleans and the rise in crime...which had NOTHING to do with the story. And, in my \"favorite\" scene in the book, he went on for PAGES about his mother's crush on Robert Stack and the old show he hosted in the 80s, Unsolved Mysteries. Paragraphs were spent describing his voice. So, if like me, you've read the good reviews for this book and expect a nostalgic setting and a gripping story, I would recommend moving on."}, {"userName": "Kelli", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146551-kelli", "userReview": "This beautifully written melancholy story has me wrapped in a blanket of nostalgia for those bittersweet days of roaming the neighbor with a posse of kids in a time that felt safer but was not.

To say this novel provoked self-reflection is a Mississippi River-sized understatement. My Sunshine Away is a lyrical Louisiana novel traveling a boy's path toward manhood through burning memories of first love, the pain of non-requital, juvenile mistakes and self-doubts, going from innocence to the teen male's idolatry of sex and objectification of females, the protagonist learns life's hard lessons via a host of females and their relationships to the wrong kind of men, including his mother who was abandoned by his adulterous and absent father, his sister who had a penchant for abusive boyfriends, and his first love who was raped and struggled mightily to move on.I truly love this book. It is so many things: suspenseful, literary, coming-of-age. And yet, it doesn't fit neatly into one, rather it transcends categorization. It is, most of all, a melody of the evolution of a young teen into a man, a man of character, of morals, and of responsibility, first and foremost, to his children and the women in his life: a real father to his kids, a devoted husband to his wife, a caring son to his mother and a brother grateful for his sisters. A high recommendation."}, {"userName": "Chance Lee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2355889-chance-lee", "userReview": "On the first page of My Sunshine Away, a fifteen-year-old girl is raped. For the next 300 pages, the narrator, the girl's male classmate and neighbor, whines about how much her rape affects him. On the literal second-to-last-page of the book, he realizes \"life is not always about me and the unloading of my conscience. The story of Lindys' rape, for instance. It is about Lindy. And that is all.\" I wish he had realized this 300 pages ago, because the 300 pages in between are insufferable. Perhaps the conclusion is an attempt to break a cycle of rape culture, but by making it the literal second-to-last-page is way too little, way too late. The narrator also repeatedly makes excuses for his behavior saying \"hey, boys will be boys\" which defeats any noble purpose this book may have had. The story is set in Baton Rouge, LA, and although the narrator tells us that Louisiana is not the shithole you think it is, what he shows us is that Louisiana is the shithole you think it is -- hot, buggy, giant insects, etc. There is a lot of that dishonesty in the book, telling the reader one thing, but showing him another. Also, this is a whitewashed Louisiana, with no minorities or LGBT characters in sight.Putting aside my SJW instincts, this is still a bad adult book. The main character seems to think he is in love with the rape victim for the entire book, but he doesn't know what love actually is. He has it confused with obsessions and lust, and he never quite seems to entangle the two. Most of his \"love\" is focused on what she can do for him -- kiss him, show him her boobs, etc. When he finally decides to do something for her, it's not something like help her train for the track team or ask her questions about her personal life, it's /find her rapist./ The main goal, of course, is to \"save\" her and gain access to her vagina. Going from objectifying her to wanting to save her is not a leap in maturity, it is merely flipping the same coin to the other, slightly less tarnished side. There is some growth, as mentioned, that comes at the end. And the author appears to suspect what a douchebro his narrator is. Lindy, the rape victim, actually calls him out on it. \"That's why you act so interested in me. So you can be a little detective and solve the case.\" Unfortunately, the author discredits this when, in a 16-year-jump a few pages later, Lindy admits that the narrator was just trying to protect her. This is not the same as forgiveness; this is re-writing what actually happened. Perhaps the narrator wouldn't have experience such slow growth if he didn't spend so much damn time going off on unrelated tangents. There is an entire chapter about how Hurricane Katrina affected Baton Rouge, again a \"waaah, this disaster that ruined millions of lives affects me!!\" but in a much briefer form. This book takes place in the early 90s. Katrina was in 2005. The chapter reads like a bad Thought Catalog essay inserted for padding. Jesmyn Ward wrote about a town actually affected by Katrina and did it much better, instead of appropriating the disaster for some nebulous purpose.Things get worse when he says things like, \"What else, besides love, do we have?\" or \"There's nothing worse, after all, is there, than having to endure a love that you don't return?\" (except maybe rape) or \"What was that exactly? An animal? Some sort of Peeping Tom? A sensitive boy racked with love and guilt?\" (Definitely not Option C.) or -- \"It broke my heart like life does.\"Barf, y'all. This is not an adult novel. This is a young adult novel, one that, with some tweaks, might actually be decent. But in today's world of eternal adolescence, this seems to pass as a book to be marketed to adults. Speaking of marketing, let's play \"What the hell are these other authors thinking?\" It seems that all the author adjacent to Louisiana had to blurb it, contributing to the decline of Southern fiction. The blurbs on the back are so misleading. Kathryn Stockett, Jill McCorkle, and Matthew Thomas think this is a mystery. And Anne Rice is \"swept up\" by the \"wisdom and compassion of the narrator\" missing the complete lack of empathy the narrator has for anyone else. Hannah Pitard says it \"make[s] us long for the heartache of youth and its inevitable sins\" which makes me wonder if she even read the last page, which pretty much is the narrator saying he regrets everything and would do it differently. And, Matthew Thomas again, with his extra-long blurb, says \"we need more novelists with the guts and clarity of M.O. Walsh.\" Yes, we need more guts and clarity. This book has neither. Please, please no."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "My Sunshine Away by M.O.

This is an upcoming author to watch.In brief, Walsh chronicles what appears the perfect world of a Baton Rouge privileged neighborhood. The adults belong to the country club. Husbands play golf. Wives play tennis. Their children attend an exclusive private school.But a beautiful veneer covers many a fault that hides in a furniture piece beneath it. Many secrets hide behind the doors of the homes on Piney Road.The polished luster that shines on the surface of this Louisiana lagniappe of infidelity and violence is shattered by the brutal rape of Lindy Simpson, a beautiful golden teen track star at the Perkins Private school.Four suspects emerge, including the nameless narrator, a unique voice, that Walsh created, leaving the reader to wonder whether the key relayer of information has a shred of reliability. This is a masterful story of family, love, loss, and the nature of friendsip.

A special, poetic read and a book of rare quality. 4.5, may change it to five, have to let it sink in... It's not an easy read (at least, not for me) and it's not fast paced so I did spend some time getting into it, the story enfolds at a pace that rather fits the stiffling heat of the Louisiana swamps... and you just have to adjust your pace too, it's too hot anyway to speed it up. And then.... enjoy the story, the characters, the environment, the descriptions.... Intriguing and very well written. It is the first novel of M.O. Walsh, writer and teacher. Recommended!There were four suspects in the crime that occurred directly on the sidewalk of Pine Creek Road. It was a crime impossible during the daylight, when we neighbourhood kids would have been tearing around in go-karts, colouring chalk figures on our driveways, or chasing snakes down into storm gutters. But at night the streets of Woodland Hills sat empty and quiet, except for the pleasure of frogs greeting the mosquitoes, that rose in squadrons from the swamps behind our properties in Baton Rouge...I should tell you now that I was one of the suspects.

It's hard to believe this is M.O. Walsh's debut novel because it's a....BOMBSHELL! The writing is phenomenal. I was hooked after the first chapter. I felt like I was right there in the story with the narrator. Such vivid and intriguing storytelling. And speaking of that narrator, I loved how halfway through the novel, I still didn't know his name, and I STILL don't know because it was never revealed. There's a reason why we don't know the narrator's name, but don't worry I won't spoil it for you. \"My Sunshine Away\" is told in the past and present tense. We learn that the narrator was deeply infatuated with a girl, Lindy, who lived across the street from him growing up. In the summer of 1989, the narrator's crush is attacked and raped while bicycling home from track practice. Lindy's life is forever changed by the traumatic event. Lindy is the narrator's \"dream girl\" but he doesn't really know her personality/pain until the later chapters. My heart just ached for her. No arrests were made in the crime, but 4 suspects were thought to be Lindy's attacker, and the narrator is one of the alleged suspects. This book was intense, brazen, beautiful, soulful and feral. I loved how the narrator has this creepy demeanor when he talks about his affection for Lindy. Is he a misunderstood kid or a deeply troubled kid? I love how Walsh's writing keeps you guessing until the very end. \"My Sunshine Away\" is a great book because every time I tried to guess what was going to happen, I was wrong again and again. I literally had no idea how the story was going to wrap up but when it did, it was well worth the wait. There's little clues dropped here and there and now that I finished it, I can see how I missed them because the clues are so subtle. NOW THIS IS A NOVEL! I am blown away by its sheer beauty and raw intensity. I highly recommend it.

It ended as it began, with beautiful writing and incredible insight into the people residing in this Baton Rouge neighborhood, and a narrator trying to make sense of his teen-age self.It begins with the rape of a 15 year old girl, which is an unbelievable thing to process for everyone in this well-to-do, safe neighborhood, where kids run around unattended, ride their bikes to the private school they all share, and live out their childhoods innocently and without trauma. But there are things below the surface of that happy veneer. There's a psychiatrist who has horrible fights with his wife, and who takes in troubled foster children. Our unnamed narrator has divorced parents and an unhappy mother. The parents of Lindy, the bright, happy girl who was raped, have difficulties dealing with what happened to their daughter, and Lindy herself is damaged beyond thinking and tries out more and more dark ways of coping. Our narrator is a 14 year old neighbor who has loved Lindy for years, a typical teen-age boy with roaring hormones and confusion about who he is and what he thinks.This is a brilliant first novel that is written in beautiful language, and with such wonderful insight into the emotions and fears of our characters.

This story of suspense orbits a certain boy - our narrator - who pines for a golden girl just a fingertip out of reach. They've grown up together in the same upscale Baton Rouge neighborhood where everyone roots for the LSU tigers, gathers for crawfish boils, and cheers for high school athletics. It is an idyllic time in the late 80s, and kids still spend time outdoors in the woods exploring, riding bikes, and visiting in person - no texting or social media. But as teenaged boys sometimes can, our narrator gets a bit fixated on the girl. You might say he is a bit obsessed. There are binoculars involved and tree climbing. It is a harmless, but deep crush - or so he tells us. The girl is attacked one evening, a snare set for her on her bike path by someone who knows her habits well. She is seemingly incapacitated, and authorities cannot get her to identify her attacker. Should we trust this narrator?Beyond the suspense here, the structure made every chapter satisfying, ending with either a poignant observation or a feathery cliff hanger - nothing too sharp or jabby. Smooth. His descriptions of Louisiana summers and New Orleans are spot on. No outsider's interpretation of etouffee, thank goodness.Walsh also treats the random bystanders in a unique way. Here's this about a piano teacher, way early in the story: \"... taught private lessons during the summer, a lady so polite it is hard to imagine her even having a cameo in a story that begins this way. She wore bright floral blouses with shoulder pads. She carried folders crammed with photocopied scales and sheet music. She often wore hats. She is the innocent stuff in the background of time. Pin her up in the sky of this place. And though I often complained to my neighborhood friends that I hated these lessons, that I hated her, this was a lie.\" Totally loved that.Lastly, I'm a pretty dry-eyed, objective reader, yet there are observations here on fatherhood, motherhood, and about sibling love that had me in tears. Walsh inserted these slices of tenderness while I was still on the edge of my seat in suspense and simultaneously in dread of this boy's regular errors in judgement. If you can relate to growing up in suburbia in a quieter time or have ever felt a desperate crush as a teenager, this is going to feel like home. Tense, but home. Five stars.

She was beautiful but didn't seem to know it, a track runner who wasn't afraid to play with the boys.\"She seemed to walk that perfect line between a person you suspect you might not deserve and the prize life would be if everything turned out right.\"But one night, Lindy becomes the victim of a crime, a crime that not all of the boys even understand. Many in the neighborhood are suspects, at least for a time. Understandably for Lindy, but also for the 14-year-old narrator of \nMy Sunshine Away\n, the crime leaves an indelible mark on their lives.The narrator has had a crush on Lindy for some time, and as he grew into adolescence, that crush blossomed into a combination of lust, love, and perhaps a little obsession. He desperately wants Lindy to like him the way he likes her, and changes his image, his attitude, his activities in the hopes of getting her attention, yet she remains distant, until a tragedy in his own life brings her back\u2014sort of.\nMy Sunshine Away\n is a meditation on growing up, and how our lives, and our futures, are shaped by both incidents and people. The narrator, now an adult, is reflecting upon the events of a period of time in his life, and how those events continue to affect him. This is a story of how adulthood gives us a different perspective on the events of our childhood, and the behaviors of those around us. It's also a reflection of how youth gives us a na\u00efvet\u00e9 that we're sometimes fortunate not to lose until we grow up, because it can protect us from the horrors that may surround us.\"But for every adult person you look up to in life there is trailing behind them an invisible chain gang of ghosts, all of which, as a child, you are generously spared from meeting.\"I thought this book was tremendously well-written and really moving. There are elements of mystery running throughout, and M.O. Walsh does a great job making you wonder just how that thread will ultimately unfold. There's a feeling of nostalgia that pervades the book, as well as feeling powerless to control the events around you. The characters are flawed but fascinating, at times unlikeable but completely compelling.At times I found the book meandered a little too much, particularly one lengthy portion that compared Baton Rouge to New Orleans, and I struggled to keep my focus, but Walsh's storytelling and the emotions the book provokes pulled me back. This is definitely one that will get you thinking and, for a sap like me, feeling, as well.

Walsh, is set in the late 80's/early 90's in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The book begins with \"There were four suspects in the rape of Lindy Simpson.....\" and the narrator just happens to be one of them. The story is narrated by an unnamed man who tells of his childhood and teenage years along with his obsession of Lindy.It was very satisfying to read this story from a male point of view.

A book that immediately delves into touchy subjects much the same way Lolita does and has a voice that reminds me of Walker Percy. This book is uncomfortably honest, allowing us to contrast dangerous fantasy and youthful action. The link between love and obsession is here along with guilt conscious voyeurism and the torturous indecision of a teenager coming of age. God, this is like two or three classics in one. I'm still amazed the author could weave such a tale and come through the ending gracefully. The amount of growth and development of the narrator as he reaches the conclusion was the saving grace for me. Any book that handles touchy subjects and ends with positive and valuable messages has my approval, just as I am quick to demean any that are pandering and are nothing but shock value. A very good book, I love these selections from The Trail."}, {"userName": "Erin Samiloglu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12946540-erin-samiloglu", "userReview": "I haven't finished this book yet...(I'm at 52%) but I have to say how frustrated I am by it. I'll finish it because I'm OCD like that, not because I care one way or another. As far as I'm concerned, the only way I'd find this book interesting is if Lindy was attacked by Colonel Mustard in the study with the candlestick. It's obvious the writer is talented, but this book reminds me of a large home with a lot of pretty rooms that have no common theme. For instance, he goes out of his way to describe Louisiana and it's inhabitants, but then in the following chapters, the Louisiana backdrop is forgotten in favor of pushing through various characters (who speak without any colloquial flavor) and back stories that don't really add anything (as far as I can tell) to the story. I've just gotten to the section where the narrator describes seeing someone on his street throw a rock into a window and then mentioning that something like that never happens -- when just chapters before, he described several shady characters that did criminal stuff like that all the time...so it's not consistent and it's getting on my nerves. Plus the narrator is a turd. But who knows, maybe I'll change my mind once I finish the thing.PS this is also proof that marketing is everything. I've read tons of books that didn't get half the media circle jerk this book did but were a million times better. Oh well, tis the age we live in.Update Okay I finished it. He did add more about Louisiana but I still thought it sucked.

Told with both suspense and insight from the view of our unnamed narrator who unfolds events from the summer of 1989 when his 15-year-old neighbor Lindy is brutally raped. He tells us this story from 20 years after, as he pieces the events of those few years together from his memories which he tells us are somewhat blurred, but squarely fall into \"before the rape\" and \"after the rape\". In his telling, I could see and feel the neighborhood - the heat, the kids everywhere, the adults, the things hidden inside houses, the things visible. Walsh particularly gets right the affect of both mundane and horrible events on the families and individuals in this upper middle class neighborhood. We gain access to the mind of a teenager - his hopes, desires, needs and obsessions - another thing that Walsh writes with great insight and lack of judgment. And we have the opportunity to see how where he grew up and the events of his teenage years affected the man he is today.There were passages that took my breath away, there were times I felt I was racing to the next chapter to find out more about what really happened that hot summer night that Lindy was raped and what was really going on with both the teens and adults in that neighborhood. At the same time there were passages that felt superfluous, like the part about Hurricane Katrina. And for some reason the ending left me less satisfied than I expected to be. But those are my only nit-picks, and I highly recommend this book. I listened to the audiobook which was narrated by Kirby Heybourne (the voice of Nick in Gone Girl). He was a perfect choice for My Sunshine Away."}, {"userName": "Mair\u00e9ad (is roaming the Undying Lands)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9184362-mair-ad-is-roaming-the-undying-lands", "userReview": "{January 21st, 2015} ARC RECEIVED + THOUGHTS THUS FARAlthough I received this the other day, it is an ARC copy I received via a Goodreads Giveaway so I will be reading it, and posting the review later and closer to the release date me thinks.

Although I will say this at the moment it's one hell of a ride. Definitely will be an intense read for anyone I think with the subject it deals with. Although it deals with the subject via an outsider, the impact is so intense that it carries the story through and there's twists that when finding out that I should have realized via the tiny clues given and sprinkled throughout. There's also the aspect of issues that the main narrator progresses through as he looks back at his past over the duration--I was quite impressed with how smoothly the character growth he displayed and yet surprised at times. It was definitely a read worth while. o:Mind you there's a lot to say, the main narrator isn't without flaws and whatnot. The story really begins at a naive place until you dive further into the subject and the intensity that lies deeper than we actually talk about the said subject these days--without things getting out of hand (trust me, I've been there way too many times and people just either get uncomfortable or awkward or childish or very rarely can it be discussed about truly in a way that it is civil enough to think about). I could go on and on, but I think it's better to discuss and think about the subject upon finishing the book itself. It really leaves you speechless at what you just finished.

Walsh. The unnamed narrator of My Sunshine Away is fourteen during the summer of 1989. He lives with his mother in middle class Baton Rouge, where he rakes leaves, plays baseball in the streets, chases the ice cream van and spies on the object of his obsessive crush, fifteen year old Lindy Simpson. One late summer evening his suburban idyll is disrupted when Lindy is is attacked on their street on her way home from a track practice. This is a story of memory and hindsight, innocence and heartache, blessings and tragedy. Walsh brilliantly recalls the emotional intensity of adolescence, the confusion, the conviction, the naivete, and the regrets that can linger into adulthood. He highlights the joy and melancholy of first love, the shock of first disappointments, and the way in which these things stay with us. The intensity of the first person narrative is tempered slightly by the adult perspective as the narrator segues between recall and rumination of Lindy's rape and the aftermath. \"Every moment is crucial. And if we recognize this and embrace it, we will one day be able to look back and understand and feel and regret and reminisce and, if we are lucky, cherish.\"Referencing defining events such as the Challenger explosion, the capture of Jeffrey Dahmer and Hurricane Katrina, Walsh evokes nostalgia for long summer days on neighborhood streets, before the advent of cell phones and the internet. He explores the way in which the experiences of childhood and adolescence help to shape who we become as adults, but also the ways in which our memories of that time may be deeply flawed.\"But for every adult person you look up to in life there is trailing behind them an invisible chain gang of ghosts, all of which, as a child, you are generously spared from meeting.\"Evocative, tender and sincere My Sunshine Away is an absorbing, beautifully observed tale."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "It was a hot, humid evening when fifteen-year-old Lindy came riding her bike home from track practice in Baton Rouge. After an attack by a male hiding in the bushes Lindy was no longer a carefree child, and dark elements surfaced in the neighborhood. Looking back to the summer of 1989 when he was a fourteen-year-old boy, the unnamed narrator begins, \"There were four suspects in the rape of Lindy Simpson....I should tell you now that I was one of the suspects.\"The story is a coming-of-age tale about a boy infatuated with Lindy. He wanted to find her attacker, and suspected others in their affluent neighborhood. He also had to cope with raging hormones and some traumatic family events. Both he and Lindy had interactions with other neighbors who seemed real and complex. Voyeurs in the neighborhood sat up on tree branches with binoculars, spied from windows, and snapped clandestine photographs.

But in the summer of 1989, when fifteen-year-old Lindy Simpson--free spirit, track star, and belle of the block--experiences a horrible crime late one evening near her home, it becomes apparent that this idyllic stretch of Southern suburbia has a dark side, too. In My Sunshine Away, M.O. Walsh brilliantly juxtaposes the enchantment of a charmed childhood with the gripping story of a violent crime, unraveling families, and consuming adolescent love. Acutely wise and deeply honest, it is an astonishing and page-turning debut about the meaning of family, the power of memory, and our ability to forgive.", "title": "My Sunshine Away", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22367526.My_Sunshine_Away", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412528921l/22367526.jpg", "reviews": 1899, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3401307.M_O_Walsh", "name": "M.O.
