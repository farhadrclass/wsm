Fitting in was not an option.\u201d\nAnd... I've finished! *sob*The last few weeks have been a whirlwind of Lunar Chronicles. After finally giving in and picking up Scarlet, even though I hated Cinder, I just haven't been able to get enough of this series. And this longass final installment was a heart-pounding, fast-paced finale.You know, I actually checked and this is the longest YA book I have ever read at over 820 pages, the second longest being Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at 766 pages. I was a bit concerned seeing as I generally think any YA book over 500 pages feels too long, but I needn't have worried. I flew through this monster.I've come to the conclusion that I really like how Meyer balances retelling with the traditional story. She gets the amount of each just right, changing up enough to keep it surprising and exciting, but slotting in many parallels to the original stories that often catch me by surprise and make me smile.I also love how far the relationships have come. Lots of funny and touching dynamics, lots of great friendships to remind us that romance isn't everything. In Winter, I loved the title character so much. In addition to the brave, level-headed Cinder, the fiery Scarlet, and the sweet, intelligent Cress, we now have Ms beautiful and crazy. Each character is very different, but important in her own way, and together they make a funny, lovable team.The book wraps up very well, delivering a dramatic and bloody climax. There are many close calls, lots of action, and lots of crazy. As I've said about the previous two books: this might not be great literature, but it sure is a rush of wild excitement.And can we all just take a moment to talk about how great Thorne is? I compared him to Gilderoy Lockhart in my review of the last book and he is still my favourite character. He's just so hilarious and ridiculous... in the best way.\nThorne scoffed. \u201cCareful is my middle name. Right after Suave and Daring.\u201d\u201cDo you even know what you're saying half the time?\u201d asked Cinder.***\u201cA kiss from the Captain would probably melt my central processor.\u201dThorne winked at her. \u201cOh trust me. It would.\u201d\nI am such a fangirl.

Her name was Katerina. She used to gaze at the sky and observe the faint light of the moon. One night, she watched a falling star and made a wish. She wished that she would belong. Escape. Travel. Feel. Little did she know that her heart's desire was about to be granted. For when the star landed on Earth, it took a woman's form. In some stories they call her the fairy god-mother. In this one, they call her Marissa Meyer.\n\n\u201cShe's our princess. And she's coming home.\u201d\n\nMarissa Meyer searched for the best way to make wishes come true, but the answer was simple. Her words, her words would be a gift to mankind. She chose to narrate the classic tales everyone loved from a different angle, adding space and androids and plagues and monsters. Adding diverse heroes and heroines, characters of different color and weight and height and backround. Adding strong friendships, sweet romances, vivid adventuress, loathsome villains and a handful of stardust. And she created The Lunar Chronicles. She created Winter.\n\n\u201cInvade Luna. Start a rebellion. End a war.\u201d\n\nKaterina found in Winter everything she ever wanted. She read about Snow White, who was beautiful and kind, crazy and delusional, who hallucinated and sang eerie songs, who was in love with her best friend and guard. She read about Cinder, who tried to be brave and make difficult desicions that would result in sacrifices and bloodbath in order to take her throne back. About Scarlet, fierce and bold and determined Scarlet, who felt that she didn't fit in until she found her home in the face of a predator, a killer. About Cress, who dreamed about happily ever afters and pretended she was a hero from a movie when she was afraid, and didn't realize how valuable she was. These four girls were different, but were bound together by a common goal and a friendship that didn't know planets and social status.\n\n\u201cHelp me. Fight for me. And I will be the first ruler in the history of Luna who will also fight for you.\u201d\n\nShe also read about Kai, who was smart and selfless and put the welfare of his people above his own happiness. About Wolf, who was savage and murderous but also a soft cupcake who fought for his humanity. About Thorne, who was funny and cocky and didn't believe he was a hero until a strange girl turned his world upside down with her faith in him. About Jacin, who was intimidating and cold, eager to do anything for his princess. Four boys, four girls and one android. Katerina loved them all, for their strangeness and their flaws, their loyalty and their hearts. Her own heart broke when they were seperated, when they were forced to do terrible things or went through terrible things. She shed tears of joy and tears of sadness.She laughed until her stomach hurt.\n\n\u201cThorne scoffed. \u201cCareful is my middle name. Right after Suave and Daring.\u201d\u201cDo you even know what you're saying half the time?\u201d asked Cinder.\u201d \n\nShe followed them through riots and executions, battles and toe-curling kisses, powerful declarations and hilarious banters. She did find Winter a little long, but stars above! a part of her didn't want it to end. She hated goodbyes.\n\n\u201cThey're the first crew I've ever had and most of them even call me Captain. I'm going to miss them.\u201d\n\nOnce Upon a Time, Katerina finished Winter. She held the book against her heart and looked at the sky. There it was. A Rampion, whose passengers were a mechanic and an emperor, a farmer and a soldier, a hacker and a smuggler, a princess and a guard. They looked down and smiled at her. She smiled back.

Unexplained and DANGLING plot threads (in order of least to greatest importance, according to ME):The unidentified RAT. Yes, Cress was primarily responsible for all the spyware in Kai's palace, but no matter how great a hacker you are, you can't manifest cameras and listening devices in strategic locations. So how did they get there?I was convinced Torin had been brainwashed, but even without him being the culprit, someone else had to be. But who?I guess we'll never know.Iko's personality chip. This is how it went down: a. Garan's unnecessary software updates are mentioned, making it more than obvious that something is hinky. b. Uprising. c. Cinder unconscious for three days. d. Cinder wakes up and IMMEDIATELY calls for meeting of world powers, where she announces Garan's research is, and has always been, in Iko's wacky personality chip.Okay, fine. I'd pretty much guessed as much based the aforementioned OBVIOUS clue. BUT. Cinder never actually confirmed this speculation. And based on Iko's surprise at the announcement, it's clear Cinder didn't check it out off-page either.That's a NEAT trick.Wolf's (further) genetic modifications. Wolf spent his early years as one of Levana's super soldiers in constant fear that he'd fail somehow and end up back on the operating table. Everything he did from the time he woke up from his initial mods was in pursuit of avoiding the lot of the majority of his soldier brethren. B/c more animal than human. B/c slaves to instincts. B/c specifically created to be violent, remorseless killing machines. And when he woke up, I'll admit I was concerned. In fact, of ALL the Bad Things, this one upset me most. B/c LOVE Wolf. And his fear of this exact fate was palpable. But oh, look at that . . . He's pretty much the same Wolf he's always been except for a few cosmetic changes. Presumably b/c Scarlet (mate/alpha/blah/whatever), but who can really say, b/c Meyer certainly didn't. ALL that buildup, all that fear, all that pressure . . . all for nothing, apparently.2. ALL THE OTHER THINGS:I've already said waaaaay too much was happening in this book . . . Meyer got lazy. Some of that laziness is evident in the unresolved plot lines, but it's also a problem with various foreshadowings. In laying the groundwork for future plot twists, instead of the subtlety, the carefully inserted details that thrilled us in hindsight, we got this:\n\u201cWhy did I pass out?\u201d Cinder interrupted. Crouching beside the couch, Jacin felt for the pulse in Cinder\u2019s wrist. After a short silence, he let it drop down again. \u201cStress, probably, along with your physical reaction to having the portscreen connected to your\u201d\u2014he gestured to her general head area\u2014\u201c computer thing.\u201d \u201cAnd you call me squeamish,\u201d said Thorne. Cinder squinted. \u201cI passed out from stress? That\u2019s it?\u201d \u201cI believe the princess term is fainted,\u201d said Thorne.\n\nRiiiiiight. After being completely submerged in water, after a 4+ story swan dive, she passed out b/c STRESS. Do I even need to address all the problems with this? How 'bout I limit it to this one: in the past, every, single time Cinder has passed out/come close to passing out, her computer brain exploded into a frenzy of cautions and warnings. BUT.Not this time. So somehow, I just wasn't surprised when it was later revealed that Cinder did in fact have something seriously wrong with her. Shades of Panem.That's pretty self-explanatory, but Luna, its outer districts and their function, the inability to communicate between the districts and thus rebel in force . . . It all felt strangely familiar . . . There were also RIDICULOUSLY overused plot devices. Like this:\u201cI accept,\u201d Cinder said, dazed. She kept hold of Levana\u2019s trigger finger but allowed Levana to lower the gun. Cinder held out her hand and Levana stared at it for a moment before reaching forward and setting the gun into Cinder\u2019s palm. In the same movement, she grabbed the forgotten knife and lurched forward, driving the blade into Cinder\u2019s heart.\nAre. You. Effing kidding me? 3. EXTREME overuse of Lunar gifts for added shock factor: This primarily manifests in the utilization of mind control, which I already mentioned. What I couldn't say is that in quick succession, a random thaumaturge forces Scarlet to try to kill Wolf, AIMERY (the swine) forces Winter to try to strangle Jacin, and Levana forces Thorne to attack DAMN EVERYBODY, but especially Cress, whom he stabs IN THE GUT.And that's not the only time something like this happens, it's just the most memorable. SIDE NOTE: I've decided to add \"No mind control\" to my list of rules b/c it makes everything too damn easy. 4. Inconsistency:Winter. She is as CRAY as Levana, but in a far less nefarious way. Her crazy is self-inflicted, b/c she refuses--I mean absolutely refuses--to use her Lunar gift. Until she doesn't. Refuse, that is. Don't misunderstand, I didn't want her to kill Jacin. And if this was the only instance of inconsistency, I probably would've let it slide. But it wasn't.Jacin's parents weren't executed, as ordered. Again, it's not like I wanted his parents to die. But it's constantly reiterated that Levana does exactly what she says she's going to do. That's why Scarlet cut off her own finger. That's why Winter contemplated the uselessness of Dude-on-trial-for-rescuing/attempting-to-rescue-his-shell-child's begging for mercy for his family, b/c once Levana says they're to be killed/enslaved, that is what will happen. And yet, Jacin's parents escaped their fate b/c they'd conveniently relocated? LIKE THAT WOULD STOP HER. Especially when she went there herself to dose Winter with THE PLAGUE. Levana's complete and total meltdown b/c true appearance revealed. Let me see if I've got this right . . . Levana, so thoroughly insane and DETERMINED that she both convinces herself that she is the best woman for the job of Queen, then carries out various horrific plots to attain her selfless goal, just gives up when the world sees her real face? Is so distraught that she can barely control the most basic bioelectrical manipulations?Hmm . . . that's mighty convenient for Cinder . . . but somehow I'm not convinced.5. How the end played out:Seeing Levana on the palace steps was the first time Iko had ever seen the Lunar queen, and her scarred face made Iko wish she wasn\u2019t immune to glamours. After years of hearing about the queen\u2019s famous beauty, the truth had been something of a letdown. But the truth was out. Thanks to Cinder\u2019s video, now everyone knew what lurked beneath the illusion.\nYou know what I took away from this book? Winter is pretty. She's so, so pretty. She might be the prettiest girl in the world. And, BONUS, she's naturally pretty. Levana is ugly. So very ugly. Sickeningly ugly. B/c scarred in childhood trauma involving FIRE. You: How awful! Me: YES. It is.See, I went to school with a girl who had pulled a pot of boiling water on her head when she was a toddler, so I know exactly what that type of injury looks like. The rough, uneven scar tissue. The way that scar tissue pulls down the corner of your eye and mouth . . . It is permanent, it is (superficially) hideous, and even if she hadn't been one of the nicest people I'd ever met, I would NEVER have been able to bring myself to use such a tragic accident against her. Some things are beyond the pale.But Meyer made the results of a similar accident the main weakness of our sociopathic, megalomaniac villain. Our villain--whom I DESPISED, for a MULTITUDE of excellent reasons--but whose #1 goal in the midst of her madness was to be LOVED. So let's run her out of town b/c UGLY. That's definitely where our focus should be. Not on the scheming and machinations, not on the infanticide, the sororicide, not on commandeering her people's children for her army and her experiments, but on her scars. On her physical flaws. You disgust me.And I don't want to hear any, \"How else could they have defeated her?\" arguments. That's not my job. That was Meyer's job. And I think she failed. Miserably.

It's over 800 pages and a lot of it is just blah blah. It reminds me of a video game with too many tedious side quests and overlong cutscenes that you can't skip through. While there's plenty of action, the meat to garnish ratio here is not filling. A good 300 pages could have been cut without the audience missing anything important.Further, I hate to say this but for a story that is so progressive about minorities and women in STEM, some of the characters are just flat. Nearly all of the men are interchangeable and it takes a second to remember them and they are mostly only important in relation to the women they are paired with. I get it if Meyer is trying to make some sort of reverse-Bechdel commentary here, but I doubt these books are supposed to have that kind of depth.You can tell the technology is advanced because each time someone uses a portscreen, they don't have to let out that sigh of frustration because they have to x out of an ad asking them to download an app when they go to a mobile site. Of course, even with adblocking apps like Crystal, this is too much of a fantasy to even hope for in our modern times.Even with all of its problems, I have to say that this cover is my favorite of the entire series:(But the whole apple thing is kinda forced here in how it's implemented, tbh.)"}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15307304-kimberly", "userReview": "OHMYGREATLUNARFEELINGS.I just finished Cress ten minutes ago.During the ten minutes after I had finished Cress:How I feel when I see the release date for Winter:HOW SHALL I MAKE IT?O, Jacin and Winter, I await greedily.Come to mamaOh please I'm dying.Dear Ms. Meyer,Please give me this book lest I turn into a crazed and handsome half wolf, half lunar rabid warrior.

I am in love! A star for each one of my ships:*Scarlet & Wolf, forever my favorites. They, I think, have had the roughest journey of all, but they're love also seems the strongest. They never waver, especially in this book. *Cress & Thorne, who fully stole my heart in Winter. They are adorable beyond words, and so very, very perfect for each other.*Winter & Jacin, with their childhood love turned into something far fiercer and truer. They are each other's rocks in a world full of crazy.*Kai & Cinder, still a little awkward, but endearing as they're finally able to be a unit.I love them all. In that order, because sometimes I like to play favorites.And a star for every other brilliant thing Marissa does with her final book. Tense sequences, pacing that, even with over 800 pages, never lets up, the descriptive lunar setting, the number of times she ripped my heart out and left me breathless, dialogue that will have you laughing one minute, swooning the next, and fist pumping a second later, characters who are just so... them. One of my favorite things about this series is how unique each personality is, each romance is, each friendship is. All the different dynamics make me so damn giddy. I will love this motley crew of the Rampion - including Iko, still boy crazy, still hilarious - until the stars fade. Already I miss them dearly. Bravo, Ms. Meyer.

What splendid tragically heartbreaking exhilarating heart warming masterpiece of a conclusion was that? Okay, deeeeeeppp breaths.........Now to begin my review; first of all 823 pages of a story it was indeed. This was easily two books fit into one. Secondly they all finally got their happily ever afters, so I'm a messy ball of goo right now. The book started of with a slightly slower pace, then elevated slowly as the book progressed. I admit with the slow pace of CRESS, seeing the number of pages in this one scared me a bit, but that anxious feeling began to evaporate as soon as it condensed. The plot was well made and easily interpreted, it answered most, if not all, of the questions I had. It gave way to the separate unwinding of all the build up that had been made in its predecessor novel. I loved cinder from the the very beginning, and her badass mechanic toughness got me going so early on, I was sure I would continue this series. But then when I read SCARLET, I was like holy mother, there is a second to main character that I ship more than the main. I'm not sure if that's even possible in the world of books, because we all ship the main protagonist then love her beta's (pun intended), but in this case I knew I was hooked on scarlet and wolf and that did NOT change. I guess the best part of this whole series for me was the fact that it was four separate stories that met halfway in a beautifully and delicately carved masterpiece to make one whole story. So many characters each with their own story to tell. And somehow it all worked together perfectly, no hiccups or shortcomings. I admit I wanted more of a happy in happily ever after for winter, but I assume there is more to her in the stars above novellas. Overall this concluding novel, was intriguing, action filled, exhilaratingly heart warming, and about another hundred something adjectives I could use, but I think I've made my point......I would recommend this series to anyone that loves a good story and plot with a brilliant idea based characterization and incredibly authentic setting. I hope anyone who read this series enjoyed it as much as I did."}, {"userName": "Kainat \u300aHUFFLEPUFF & PROUD\u300b", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14717996-kainat-hufflepuff-proud", "userReview": "Solid 4.5 STARS. \n\u201cDo me a favor, Princess. The next time someone says they're going to kill you, don't just let them.\u201d \nI finished this! Again. They left me. Again. It's a bittersweet feeling. On one hand, I am completely satisfied with how Meyer decided to tie things up, but then on the other, i wouldn't have minded another book. Things felt a little rushed at times? The only complaint I have is Thorne and Cress's relationship. It feels wrong? I don't know about you guys but Cress is like a child in my head. Then we have Thorne who is a little narcissistic. Don't get me wrong, i still love the shit out of him. All I'm trying to say is he and Cress don't make much sense, or maybe as a couple, they lack development. His abrupt attraction for Cress was a bit inconceivable. I just didn't buy his sudden feelings for her. Where did they even come from? I would have preferred them just being friends. I think Thorne would be more suitable for someone like Scarlet and Cress with Wolf. May is my reread month!How do you feel about each character?Iko: She needs to get together with AIDAN and take over this horrible world. Cress: (Rapunzel)A lost bunny in the wilds. Someone protect this cinnamon roll. Thorne:(Flynn Rider) Silly, selfish . . is what he wants you to think.

I have so many feelings and even after a week of finishing it, I still don't know where to begin or how to gather my thoughts into actual words. So here is me trying my best.It was absolutely wonderful. This whole universe that Marissa Meyers morphed into her own is wonderful. Cyborgs, moon-people with brain manipulation (that is actually more scientific than magic) and the fight for the throne. That's what it boils down to, right? Fighting for the throne? What I especially loved about this book was Winter. She was so damaged and 'crazy', but she was still kind of wanting to do the right thing and selfless and-- absolutely adorable. When Marissa described the visions she would have about turning to ice or heads rolling on the floor or the walls bleeding, I felt like it was legitimately happening. Like, I saw what she saw and I understood why she would let other people believe her mind was completely gone: because it was easier to seem crazy than to seem weak. She reminds me so much of the cartoon Snow White though. Lover of all animals? Check.Kind of a loon? Check.Has an evil step-mother? Check.Has an evil step-mother that disguised herself as.. er.. this? Check.Eats an apple and falls asleep/dies? Check.Awakes with true loves..er.. yah. Well, maybe.Singing randomly? Check. My one concern is.. where are my dwarves? Unless we are counting Cinder, Cress, Scarlett, Thorne, Wolf, Iko and Kai as the dwarves.. which is a little weird but I could go with it.Meyer stayed true to the tales in each of these books. Even though they were formed into one, twisted and beautiful masterpiece, each character had their own fairytale. Jacin, our huntsman in this tale, is absolutely wonderful. He did everything in his power to keep his princess (Winter) safe. He got manipulated by Levana and her goons, basically was treated like a Ken doll because he had to keep his mind so blank, he would betray even the rightful queen to the throne if it meant saving the girl he-loves-but-won't-say-out-loud-because-that-might-put-her-in-more-danger-so-he-tries-to-keep-that-part-to-himself.Scarlett and Wolf are the epiphany of \"I will love you no matter what you look like and no matter how many times you try to kill our friends and no matter how many times you do the stupidest thing you can think of\". Scarlett really became her own wolf in this book. She saw what had to be done and did it with no remorse.Cinder and Kai are the most selfless people in this whole story. Especially Kai. Kai is set to marry the person he loathes the most. He is willing to kill her and himself in order to keep his people safe. Cinder has become the world's most wanted, has ruined her reputation, and has risked her life for people she has never even met before. For people she never even had any good thoughts about before. Even though they have something pure between them, they know what matters most is their kingdoms. I wish these two were real people. We need that kind of selflessness in these times.Thorne and Cress are my absolutely favorite characters possibly of all books and movies and shows I have ever witnesse in my life. Cress is full of pureness. She just wants to help. She is so scared of most things but she is still going to do what she has to in order to help her friends. Thorne sees that pureness and wants to live up to deserving her love. Because boy, does Cress love Thorne up and down and all around. My goodness, that crush is bigger than the moon itself. And I LOVE THAT. Because usually, heroines in young adult books these days are too stubborn or stupid to admit they like someone as much as Cress does. She doesn't care.I JUST LOVE THEM! I AM TRASH FOR THEM.IKO! It was really hard to find a GIF for Iko, so there's Nicki Minaj with blue hair. It kind of fits, right? No? Okay well anyway, Iko will do anything to help Cinder. She is obsessed with material things like dresses, make up, and imagining she knows what certain things taste like. She likes to look nice, there is nothing wrong with that! But she is so unbeliebably funny and realistic for an android and just flat out human. More human than most humans.Levana.. I liked her as the villain. She was flawed and hurt and basically trying to prove to no one but herself that she was worthy of being a queen. She wasn't pure evil, she had a reason for the things she was doing (even if they were legitimately wrong and she should have not tried to kill a child because of something someone else did). A good villain to me is someone who is doing what they see as right and that they have understanding and reasoning behind what they are doing. I mean, they are still wrong, hence being a villain, but it doesn't mean that you don't see where she is coming from.She wore her own kind of masks. It's absolute agony that this series is over. I have the novellas and the comic left to read, but I am going to miss these characters like I would miss my right arm. Meyer really knows how to make you fall in love with some characters that don't exist. But to soften the blow of a story ending, here is some killer fan art that someone named Julie Crowell drew. It's absolutely wonderful and miraculous and I wish I had this kind of talent.CREDIT: JULIE CROWELLWrensReads | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram"}], "description": "Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for her grace and kindness, and despite the scars that mark her face, her beauty is said to be even more breathtaking than that of her stepmother, Queen Levana.Winter despises her stepmother, and knows Levana won't approve of her feelings for her childhood friend--the handsome palace guard, Jacin.
