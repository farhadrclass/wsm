Ruth is depressed and overweight and she doesn't feel she's a good mother and she loves the depressing saltmarsh where she lives and she likes her job and blah blah. Yes, we get it. Nelson is a tough working-class northern guy, and blah blah blah. We get that too, we heard it all before (about three times in three other books, in fact) with exactly the same words you used in this book. If you can't find an original way to give information on your characters to potential new readers, maybe you should try something else, like, I don't know, writing something that ISN'T a series of books with the same characters? Not copying the two diminutive bits of forensic archaeology information straight from wikipedia would help, too. I suppose it may not make a difference to most readers, but having started a biological anthropology course just 3 months before reading this book I had enough knowledge to get infuriated at how superficial Griffith's presentation of forensic archaeology is. I'm not expecting her to get a degree in forensic sciences or anything, but at least get your facts straight and don't simplify things for the sake of a plot twist.So, although probably no one cares, here's a list of the most annoying things: - You do NOT establish the sex of a skeleton based on a single characteristic, and you definitely don't do it with one look. You're not good at suspense anyway, you might as well have written that Ruth spent hours squinting at the skeleton like serious professionals do and then came up with the answer. - An osteoarchaeologist would definitely not have nightmares and be horrified by cut marks on skulls. No, no and no, it just makes Ruth a character that is very difficult to believe in. If you work with human remains you get past that phase really quickly; or you never go through it, I never did. Does it sound heartless? We're interested in bones, we don't think that's morbid, and we certainly don't have nightmares about it. Ending a chapter in \"Those heads had been scalped!\" didn't make me go \"OMGwhatabarbarousthingtodo!\", it just made me roll my eyes and put the book down. (Incidentally, you can actually survive being scalped). - There is no way you get to PhD level without hearing about NAGPRA and the issue of repatriation of human remains belonging to Native American and Australian Aborigine tribes. It's a sensitive issue and a very interesting one, and I heard about it for the first time during the last year of my BA. Again lots of copying and pasting from wikipedia, lots of generalization, and nothing else. Will I read more books by Elly Griffiths in the future? Only if she doesn't mention forensic techniques ever again, and if Cathbad is there, because Cathbad is cool.

It felt to me like this is the weakest so far. The first half of the book includes much discussion of the exploration of Australia, the ravaging of Aboriginal holy relics, and efforts for the repatriation of human remains. I think this was just sort of interesting, too long, and delayed the \"meat\" of the book. The pace eventually picks up in the second half when the owner of a museum and horse racing stable dies, Nelson falls deathly ill, Ruth encounters Max, Judy uncovers a drug ring, and Cathbad does his thing. As usual, there is the tongue-in-cheek humor and mysticism."}, {"userName": "Jacki (Julia Flyte)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095931-jacki-julia-flyte", "userReview": "I have read and enjoyed the first three books in this series by Elly Griffiths, about forensic archeologist Dr Ruth Galloway. But this one was a disappointment. The storyline is ridiculous, the characters are stereotypes who behave in the silliest of ways, the writing is clunky and the pace is sluggish. It simply doesn't live up to its predecessors. If you're wondering if you need to have read the other books in the series, the answer is no: however if you haven't read them, they're better books than this one!The story kicks off with the discovery (by Ruth) of a museum curator lying dead next to the coffin of a fourteenth century bishop. The coffin was discovered during the construction of a supermarket and was brought to the museum for an official opening. The bishop was an ancestor of Lord Danforth Smith, a local horse trainer who also owns the museum. It emerges that the museum has been receiving threats connected to a collection of Aboriginal skulls which a group feels should be returned to Australia. The group includes Ruth's new next door neighbour as well as her druid friend Cathbad. There are several strands to the plot - some of which are unnecessary and seem to have been thrown in simply to provide a few red herrings. I was also irritated by the way that the author feels the need to tell us everything that has happened in the series up until now, to the point of spoiling little twists in the previous books (like what happened to her cat in The Crossing Places). Ruth is almost peripheral to much of the action in this installment - as is Nelson, for that matter. While it wasn't a total write off, it was a disappointment and I very much hope that the next book is an improvement."}, {"userName": "Tanja Berg", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg", "userReview": "I don\u2019t know what to make of the crimes presented in this book.

Despite the third novel ending with a cliffhanger, A Room Full of Bones starts with a typically humorous episode as Ruth rushes round the King's Lynn branch of Somerfield frantically shopping for Kate's first birthday party the following day. She has one final job on her way home at the rather unprepossessing Smith museum, overseeing the opening of the medieval coffin of Bishop Augustine Smith, an ancient ancestor of the family who run the museum. Arriving early, she finds herself met by the dead body of curator Neil Topham, lying beside the unopened coffin. True to form DCI Harry Nelson is having no truck with the talk of a curse surrounding the disturbance of the coffin causing the demise of Topham, preferring instead to take a closer look at the quantity of pure cocaine and the threatening letters from a group called the Elginists, who advocate the repatriation of the the Aborigine skulls, held within the Smith museum, to their original home down under.Looking into the death and the group behind the letters leaves DCI Nelson and his team stretched to the limit with the altogether more pressing matter of tackling the drugs which are proliferating the county of Norfolk. Suspicions about the pressure group known as the Elginists and the rather aristocratic racehorse trainer, Lord Danforth Smith ensure Nelson keeps digging and when a second death within a week connected to the museum occurs, also attributed to natural causes, Nelson knows that that he is finally getting closer to the truth. Lab assistant at the university by day, druid and godparent by night, Cathbad's usual talent for embroiling himself in matters continues, from his friendship with Ruth's Aussie neighbour to his shadowy connections to the Elginists. Griffiths has an excellent eye for characterisation and as well her regular cast she involves several others who provide an injection of humour, most notably in didgeridoo playing Australian neighbour, Bob Woonunga and the eclectic Smith family.As the novel progresses Griffiths returns to the continuing personal dramas of the characters, detailing Michelle's reaction on discovering that Nelson is the unnamed father of baby Kate. In a bid to save his marriage Nelson has agreed to stop seeing Kate and only to encounter Ruth when work makes this inevitable. With an empty nest and walking on eggshells around Michelle, Nelson is weighed down by guilt whilst a hurt Ruth attempts to convince herself that she wasn't slightly disappointed by his decision to save his marriage. As is the usual way of their interactions we see Nelson and Ruth tongue-tied and muddling along in a mix of misunderstandings and irritation when they come across each other. As the series progresses and readers learn more about the secondary characters who surround Ruth, the tension between the pairings of Shona and Phil, DS Dave Clough and field archaeologist, Trace and the more recent development of DS Judy Johnson and Cathbad come into their own and these elements become almost as critical to proceedings as the Nelson and Ruth connection. The pressures that Ruth is faced with differ in all of the cases which she has been involved with and the new consideration here is one-year-old daughter, Kate. Whilst slowly coming to terms with motherhood and the lack of sleep, Ruth is never less than certain that having a child was what she always wanted but, rest assured, her usual dry humour is in fine fettle throughout. Elly Griffith's great strength is in tempering the mystical new age messages from Cathbad, with the no- nonsense attitude of atheist Ruth and the out and out scepticism of Nelson. Emotions run high in A Room Full of Bones but the novel is cleverly plotted and delivers a highly satisfying mystery element, perhaps the most well thought out in the series so far. Long may the soap opera of the Saltmarsh continue!"}, {"userName": "John Wiltshire", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31591928-john-wiltshire", "userReview": "I'm getting increasingly irritated with this series. I was lying awake last night trying to work out why and it suddenly occurred to me that perhaps the author never actually intended it to be a series. The first book had something a bit special with interesting characters and a strong sense of place. But then the second book didn't progress anything from that, nor the third...This is the fourth now, and if I read one more time about the wood henge on the Saltmarsh being moved, or Cathbad protesting, or Eric's thoughts and sayings I'm giving up. The books just seem to harp on the same themes now. And in a similar vein, I don't see any character development at all from Book 1. Sure, events happen, but no change to the fundamental characters. Ruth was interesting in the first book. Now she's just a bit fatter with a baby in tow, and for some reason a great deal dumber. I mentioned in my review for Book 2 that I was surprised she didn't, for example, speak Latin, being an archaeologist and all. I am still being constantly amazed by her ignorance about almost everything! I don't know whether this is just a device the author uses to enable her to have exposition (Ruth doesn't know something so she asks Nelson and he explains; Nelson doesn't understand something so he asks...yeah, you get the idea). If I said someone was an Elginist to you, what would your immediate thought process be? Elgin...Elgin marbles...fight to have them repatriated to Greece, so a member of a group dedicated to repatriation of stolen artefacts? Well you're cleverer than a doctor and professor of archaeology, and a detective inspector, neither of whom could work that out unaided.Seriously, would an educated person, an archaeologist, not know the origin of the name of Catherine Wheel fireworks? I can't believe it. Every educated person can reel off things like that...it's the definition of being educated! And would a policeman, a Detective Inspector, not know what a pulmonary embolism is when the coroner tells him it's the cause of death?So, I come onto the liberal drivel, which I mentioned in a previous review. I tolerated the last book which was all about the Home Guard in Norfolk committing war crime atrocities on \"innocent\" German soldiers who invaded (ie, evil British soldiers) but now we're onto indigenous peoples and I suspect we're about to defeat evil British imperialists.I won't even get onto the pov annoyance. Actually, yes, I will. Anyone and everyone can and does have pov in these novels now. We just jump from character to character for tiny scenes from their pov just to forward the storytelling. It's not really good writing.But for all this...for all this, I'm still reading because they still do have something about them. I'll finish this one, but if there's not some major character development and purpose to this being a series I'm making this the last.I'll update when done. Nope, I've given up on this one. I got to a bit where Ruth Galloway--let's give her her title: Dr Ruth Galloway...let's remember she's an archaeologist in Norwich...has a discussion with a local historian and has to be told who Mother Julian is...Julian of Norwich. How can anyone not have heard of Julian of Norwich? Anyone who is educated, who can read, who has an enquiring mind...it literally beggars belief that an archaeologist would be fundamentally dumb. I just can't make any more allowances for this author."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "I'm always pleased to hear that another Elly Griffiths novel is on its way and no less this time. The mystery was a little different in this outing, with Ruth, the forensic archaeologist, more removed from the central action than in prior books. But she is very involved with the central characters and these novels are as much about the characters as the mystery.The story involves a small, local museum and the planned opening of a recently unearthed casket of a medieval bishop. Moving on from this, we learn of the local nobility's ownership of native bones taken by his ancestor from Australia in the last century. There is unexplained death of course, and hints of more other-worldly happenings alluded to in an earlier book. The story of Ruth, Nelson, the various members of the police, Cathbad the local Druid who always seems to be in the middle of everything, and now a visitor from Australia are all developed further. Quite a mix. There are some forensic surprises too.In some ways this edition feels less structured or perhaps more far flung with plot, but I didn't mind.

As well as the highly likeable Ruth, it features the other familiar characters from the previous books such as DCI Harry Nelson, Cathbad the druid etc.There are two intersecting plotlines in this novel. The first concerning a couple of suspicious deaths relating to a museum which has a collection of Australian Aboriginal skulls; the second relating to drug-smuggling through the port of Felixstowe. Correspondingly, the final chapters continually veer between one plotline and the other as they both come to a climax.

In the past the Bishop was thought to have been buried inside Norwich Cathedral. Lord Danforth Smith couldn't be more pleased to welcome his long deceased ancestor to his museum but it seems he is alone with these feelings for he has a growing number of those in opposition to this transference and more than this...much more.Soon Ruth finds a new neighbor from the Aboriginal part of Australia.

This one does not really involve Ruth's skills as a forensic archeologist but two different mysteries twine themselves throughout the story. Kate, Ruth's daughter, is one now and is starting to develop a personality. The story involves a misplaced casket of a medieval bishop who has some surprising secrets. These secrets push Nelson and Ruth to a new dimension in their relationship. There is also a drug operation causing trouble and a mysterious stable and museum. There are a lot of twists and turns before it comes to a satisfying conclusion. I can't recommend this series more highly. It is important to read them in order as they build on each other.

Despite all the warnings Augustine gave about leaving his remains alone, a small \"unveiling\" is scheduled in the Smith Museum, presently owned by one of Augustine's descendants. Forensic archaeologist Dr. Ruth Galloway has been asked to preside over the opening of the coffin, but when she shows up at the museum a little early, she finds the curator dead on the floor by the bishop's remains.Ruth's daughter Kate has just turned one, and Ruth feels as though she's slowly getting the hang of being a mother, even if Kate lets her get very little sleep. She'd like to be more interested in the curator's death, but the coroner labels it natural causes, and Ruth moves on to the next items in her busy agenda.Bishop Augustine's unveiling is done very quietly, which is a good thing because something totally unexpected occurs. Augustine's descendant, Lord Smith, shows Ruth a room full of Aboriginal bones another ancestor harvested and brought back to England from Australia. A group called the Elginists is demanding that the bones be repatriated to their homeland, but Lord Smith views them as his rightful possessions and refuses. Shortly thereafter Lord Smith dies-- also of natural causes?-- and Detective Chief Inspector Harry Nelson is brought in to investigate.Having been searching for drug smugglers, Nelson isn't convinced that these deaths are natural, especially when threatening letters to both victims turn up, but when he's hospitalized with a mysterious and deadly fever, his team have to take up the slack and try to find out how a medieval bishop, Aboriginal bones and drug smuggling all tie in together.Although part of a series, this book can easily be read as a standalone because Griffiths fills in many details from the previous books (sometimes to the detriment of earlier plot points). The story here is a good one, with several elements that I didn't deduce before the author showed me how they fit together.If you're the type of reader who demands that favorite characters remain front and center in each book of a series, you're going to be a bit disappointed in this one. Although there is much about Ruth and Harry's ever-evolving relationship, they are often at the periphery of the investigation. Although I did miss them, this allows Griffiths to let her secondary characters stretch their wings a bit and provide many exciting scenes.Two things really excited me about this book. One was the plot. I love stories with strong elements of superstition and legend in them that can be explained by something concrete and almost commonplace. Not only does it give my brain a workout, this sort of plot does the same for the characters in showing how they react to it and investigate it. Griffiths' plot moved like a well-oiled machine, and I found myself reading faster and faster in an attempt to gather it all in and find a solution before the characters did.The second thing that excited me was Griffiths' cast of characters. The cast is growing and developing strong new faces, which bodes well for the future of the series. The relationship between Ruth and Harry with its awkwardness and misunderstandings, the way Ruth is adapting to motherhood and the appearance of another man in her life, the way Harry and his wife are trying to hold things together... all these elements are constantly evolving as they would in the real world. In this book I was reminded time and again of my favorite \"relationship\" series written by Deborah Crombie. To have this series join the ranks of those in which the characters attain such a level of verisimilitude is very exciting stuff indeed."}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "First Sentence: The coffin is definitely a health and safety hazard.Professor and forensic archeologist Ruth Galloway arrives at a family-owned museum to supervise the opening of the family\u2019s ancestor, a medieval bishop. Instead, she finds the body of the museum curator dead of an apparent heart attack. His death is followed by that of the Museum owner and owner of a horse-training stable, who had received threatening letters regarding the repatriation of Aboriginal skulls to an Australian representative. Do the skulls carry a curse, or is there an equally evil but more human motivation going on?Ms. Griffiths has a very good ear for dialogue and for wry humor. The characters emotions, doubts and insecurities are handled in a way that we can be empathic to them, having perhaps experienced some of them ourselves. However, there are times that the protagonist\u2019s inner dialogue is often stronger and more natural than the verbal exchanges between characters. This is offset by the very evocative descriptions; not only of places, but of feelings and concerns.The characters are dimensional and although some may feel there is too much back-story given, I very much appreciate an author who does not assume everyone has read the previous books in the series. A weakness comes when the characters\u2019 stories\u2019 overwhelms the mystery and the person for whom you may feel the most sympathy is one of the more secondary characters. Yet there is such realism and near rawness of emotion, it shouldn\u2019t be changed.The story gives a very interesting presentation of the two sides of the argument regarding the repatriation of art and artifacts. While there are other authors who do include mysticism in their plots, Griffiths combines both the mysticism of the Celtic and Aboriginal beliefs in a very effective way yet also providing a scientific explanation as well. \u201cA Room Full of Bones\u201d contains several different threads to the story.

I think the worst part was when all sense was abandoned and one drug tripping hippie type entered the dreams of a friend who was lying in hospital close to dying from a deadly spore he inhaled while standing too near a coffin being opened after a few hundred years. Really? I have been waiting for the series to offer up a little more forensics archeology (that's what the main character supposedly does for a living) but there has really been so very little of that. Anyone who has read the Irish Country Doctor series or even the James Herriott country vet stories knows what I mean. The story is only so appealing because so much interesting information about the main character's specialty is learned by the reader as the story goes along. This one drops a sentence now and then but not enough. I do like the characters but thought by now they would flesh out a little more and Ruth Galloway especialy. OH and let's not reapeat everything that happened verbatim from previous books in each subsequent book okay? A quick refresher in the beginning for newcomers to the series or folks who have waited a while between books is plenty. That's good enough, no need to do that more than once in the same book. I think someone needs a proper reader/editor instead of yes men who just run 'round crying, \"Marvelous!\". I do like these and hope Ms Griffiths writes more. She certainly has a knack for it, more than all of us armchair critics who write silly little reviews.

Griffiths manages to leave the end of each book, if not on a cliffhanger, with enough suspense that you are always keen to see what happens next. The last book The House at Sea\u2019s End had Michelle, the glamorous wife of DCI Harry Nelson beginning to suspect that Ruth\u2019s infant daughter with an unnamed father is her husband\u2019s child. However the author doesn\u2019t plunge us straight into this plot strand but starts the book with the first death that Nelson has to investigate.Ruth is scheduled to attend the official opening of the mediaeval coffin of a Norfolk Bishop. The prelate is also the ancestor of a prominent Norfolk family, headed by Lord Danforth Smith, who owns the museum where the ceremony will take place. Before the coffin can be opened however, the curator of the museum, Neil Topham, is found dead next to the sarcophagus. Although death is ruled the result of natural causes, Nelson\u2019s interest is sufficiently piqued to look into the background of all the Smith family.When a second person connected to the mediaeval bishop is found dead rumours circulate of an ancient curse that is affecting all those who come into contact with the body. Meanwhile a group of people are pressurising the museum to return the aboriginal skulls that have been languishing in the museum\u2019s store. Led by the druid Cathbad, he once more plays a catalytic role when danger comes to both Ruth and Nelson.After the previous three books, I found that I was reading this as much for the characters as the crime that Nelson has to solve. The protagonists are now settling down into their respective roles and many of the subsidiary characters of the previous books are given more substance in this one. These include Shona, now pregnant and living with Phil, Ruth\u2019s boss and Nelson\u2019s wife Michelle, who is given a much sympathetic portrayal as the betrayed wife struggling to come to terms with Nelson and Ruth\u2019s previous relationship and the baby daughter who looks so like her father.The actual murder investigation was interesting and became more complex than it initially appeared. I\u2019m not sure I completely believed the background to either the deaths or to the subsidiary crime that the Smith family become embroiled in but it was an enjoyable read.But the true strength of Elly Griffith\u2019s writing is her focus on characterisation and the relationships that interweave between groups of people.

The series features Ruth Galloway, an overweight, introverted forensic anthropologist and archaeology teacher at a local university. The series is set in a seaside area not far from Brighton. This is the fourth book in the series. Ruth will soon be celebrating Kate's birthday. Kate is nearly a year old now and, of course, has changed Ruth's life completely. Kate is the result of a one night stand with a local police detective. Their paths cross often since Ruth is also a consultant when bones are discovered. Thanks to Britain's archaeology laws, any bones that are found could mean either a murder or a potentially important archaeological site. A local privately owned museum is celebrating an important find: a coffin containing the body of a 14th century bishop is being opened. The occasion is being celebrated with some celebration. However, Ruth gets there a little earlier and discovers the museum director on the floor with a faint pulse. He dies before he gets to the hospital. The prognosis is uncertain so DI Nelson investigates. His team is also investigating a baffling drug importation case at the same time. Nelson finds letters to the Director warning him about something, but the meaning is unclear. Lord Danforth Smith, a local horse trainer and descendent of the 14th C bishop, is also the proud owner of the museum which has, as the title says, \"A Room Full of Bones.\" The bones were taken by his grandfather who owned mines in Australia and took the bones of native Australians back to Britain when he retired. Ruth is asked by Lord Smith to assess the bones. He has been asked to return them to Australia because the natives believe that their ancestors are not truly at rest unless their bones are returned to their native land. He resists that idea completely of course. As always, Griffiths writes with a great deal of atmosphere and not a little tongue-in-cheek. This is a series that is worth reading, but if you do, start with the first.

In general, I feel that the writing of Ms. Griffiths is much more approachable than Ms. Reich's current releases. The books still have the feeling of being fresh and the characters not worn out. Furthermore, I enjoy the characters of this book. As stated previously, they aren't perfect and have their character flaws, so one can generally put themselves into the storyline. The story flowed incredibly well and left me guessing as to the ending. Drama and crime were very well balanced to keep my interest and to get to know the characters. I would like to see scenery developed a bit deeper. I have noted that this is a weakness with Ms. Griffith's writing. I like to feel \"that I am in a scene and can picture it in my mind\". This is something that I have noted has been missing across the board with all her books, but I do still consider them to be enjoyable despite this flaw. On an ending note,as the books do build off one another and Ms. Griffith's writing is highly character driven, I do encourage readers to read the books in order to have a firm grasp of each character's development."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "A Room Full of Bones by Elly GriffithsPublished 2012, Houghton Mifflin HarcourtStars: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (3.5)Review also posted at: Slapdash & Sundry3.5 starsI'm having a hard time deciding just what to rate this between 3 and 4 stars, so I'm going to settle on 3.5 stars.Storywise, I feel like it was a pretty week entry in the series. There were a LOT of plot strings in this one, and while it's nice that they all didn't end up being the same culprit/storyline, they made for a tangled mess at certain points. Also, the plot twist was interesting. Not what I expected, but also made for a little bit of a letdown in terms of solving a whodunnit. Thus, 3 stars of \"like it\" but not \"love it\" quality.On the other hand, there was quite a bit of development in many of the characters, Ruth, Cathbad, Nelson, Michelle, Max, Judy, Clough, etc. I'm a big fan of character growth and development (one primary reason I love series so much), so this tempted me to make it 4 stars.All around, still entertaining, so a little more than liked it, a little less than loved it."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4501926-richard", "userReview": "Much awaited return of of Ruth Galloway, the fourth in an excellent series set in Norfolk. Familiar characters return and perhaps are to over written to bring the reader up to speed. As a result I feel the first part of the book drags and is in danger of becoming becalmed.However it remains faithful to its characters and advances their stories along seamlessly perhaps with a nod to a television series.there is a good mystery / thriller in here somewhere and it is beautifully crafted into the conclusion of the book. A stand alone book it isn't however and I doubt if read first would have you scurrying to the library to read the earlier accounts.I though am hooked through all four books and want to learn more about the characters especially Nelson the detective and Cathbad the true soul of the writing.I look forward to reading more in this series but hope the stories will speak for themselves as independent pieces."}, {"userName": "Snicketts", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237278-snicketts", "userReview": "I enjoyed this one more than number three in the series. The newly introduced characters had more presence to them this time. I liked what the author did with the relationship between the two main characters and the new facets of the supporting recurring characters. They're really settling in to feel familiar and reliable. The ambiguity between the 'spiritual' solution and the 'scientific' solution was neatly handled with no arch commentary one way or the other. The story also touched on some interesting material concerning the ownership of archaeological finds that rang very true. I'm still loving Ruth and her busy little home in the corner of a place I know well. There was less of Nelson in this one, but a realistic and bittersweet look at his marriage. Cathbad and Judy have a nice sub-plot going on that is showing us a new side of Cathbad, humanising him somewhat.

It is one thing to be head of Forensic Archelogy at the University of North Norfolk. It is quite another thing to raise a child as a single parent. In addition to everything else the overwhelmed mother is doing, she was talked into having a birthday party for Kate. That means she is desperately racing though the market trying to find the right stuff for adults and kids in attendance before heading to another appointment. Dr. Galloway is glad the child escaped being born on Halloween. Bad enough she has Pagan godfather, but at least she was born on All Saints Day. Dr. Galloway needs to get the shopping done quickly as she has to get over to the local museum for a media event. With the department chair out of town, Dr. Galloway has to stand in to represent the University at the Smith Museum for the opening of the coffin believed to belong to Bishop Augustine Smith.Discovered at a site that was once a church destroyed by bombing during WW2 the industrial land had kept several secrets until now. As the site was being cleared and worked for a new building, the foundations of a medieval church were discovered. Also found was most likely the high alter for the ancient church. Underneath that, a coffin was discovered that dates back to the fourteenth century. The inscriptions on the coffin and other clues indicate that it holds the remains of Bishop Augustine Smith. If that is true, it would mean that Bishop Augustine Smith was entombed at a fairly minor parish church in King\u2019s Lynn and not at Norwich Cathedral as historians have long believed.With descendants of Bishop Smith alive and well connected, somebody made a decision to open the coffin in front of the media. The bones have to be examined and carbon dated, but first there has to be media coverage despite the fact that Lord Danforth Smith would prefer otherwise. The Smith Museum and its contents are part of a family legacy tied to the Bishop and numerous other parties so opening the coffin at the museum is going to be a media event. This is history and the opening of the coffin must be recorded and presented for all to see. That is until Ruth goes deep into the Smith Museum and finds the curator, Neil Topham, dead on the floor next to the coffin. She calls for help and before long DCI Henry Nelson and his team are involved in the case. It is not long after that when a second body is discovered. History, legends, and the past are all present, but clearly, there is a very modern day murderer at work in A Room Full of Bones.The fourth book in the series that began with The Crossing Places is another good one. Though it could have been better as a plot point used for one character is used again here for another one. By doing so, it comes across as a soap opera contrivance and a clich\u00e9 and not character development as intended. It also creates a moment of incredulity for the reader and is jarring due to the stupidity of it all.Still the history and the mystery are strong storytelling elements in A Room Full of Bones as is the ongoing personal relationship between individuals as well as the investigative team as a whole. This series is as much about the mystery and the past as it is about how these characters live their lives away from the job. Even the minor characters are not superfluous or shallow. These series features books of depth and complexity and are very much worth your time.

On Halloween night, the Smith Museum in King's Lynn is preparing for an unusual event -- the opening of a coffin containing the bones of a medieval bishop. But when forensic archaelogist Ruth Galloway arrives to supervise, she finds the curator, Neil Topham, dead beside the coffin. Topham's death seems to be related to other uncanny incidents, including the arcane and suspect methods of a group called the Elginists, which aims to repatriate the museum's extensive collection of Aborigine skulls; the untimely demise of the museum's owner, Lord Smith; and the sudden illness of DCI Harry Nelson, who Ruth's friend Cathbad believes is lost in The Dreaming -- a hallucinogenic state central to some Indigenous Australian beliefs. Tensions build as Nelson's life hangs in the balance. Something must be done to set matters right and lift Nelson out of the clutches of death, but will Ruth be able to muster herself out of a state of guilt and foreboding in order to do what she does best?", "title": "A Room Full of Bones\n      \n          (Ruth Galloway #4)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12624533-a-room-full-of-bones", "average": 3.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1471642573l/12624533.jpg", "reviews": 689, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2541526.Elly_Griffiths", "name": "Elly Griffiths"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Mystery", "Fiction", "European Literature", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12624533-a-room-full-of-bones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6268639-a-room-full-of-bones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12783927-a-room-full-of-bones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15729023-k-nslan-av-d-d", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13184022-a-room-full-of-bones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6688087-the-crossing-places", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6268632-the-janus-stone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9130129-the-house-at-sea-s-end", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15814458-a-dying-fall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18222687-the-outcast-dead"]}
