The story concerns the child Grace Serenity born to a pair of teenagers. Cheri gives birth to Grace Serenity but dies in a car crash soon after she flees the hospital. The chapters alternate between Jake, and Leila the childless Nigerian woman married to David, an English curate. Leila is not your average minister\u2019s wife, if such a thing even exists. Jake is a 40 year old man afraid of commitment who has broken up with Anna and, being jobless, gets roped into going on the quest by Deborah\u2019s husband Perry and other family members. It is a sad story of a child caught between two families. Matt, the young single father,his parents and sister, and the desperate childless couple, David and Leila, who want to adopt Grace.The book raises issues associated with interracial marriages, childlessness, adoption, parental rights and. It also presents a sad picture and comment on some family relationships.I found some of the characters like Perry and Deborah, selfish, manipulative and self obsessed in the extreme and wondered why Jake was so fascinated with them. Despite this I became involved in the story and it kept me reading to see what happened, even though I had an idea what that would be. I read it through in a day or so. It\u2019s a good quick read but it still had plenty to think about. It made me angry at times and teary but that just shows I was involved with the story and the characters, even if I didn\u2019t like all of them."}, {"userName": "Miz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6907245-miz", "userReview": "YAH A NEW ZEALAND WRITER.I'm a fan of Charity's easy contemporary fiction novels and this was no exception. Well written, good character development, and I was invested in the story enough that I wanted it to turn out one way. I'm not divulging how close to the actual storyline I 'guessed', but nevertheless if you're a fan of her other novels this will stand up to scrutiny."}, {"userName": "Book Bazaar", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875379-book-bazaar", "userReview": "London, 1990s. In a hospital ward, Cherie, 16, black, gives birth to Grace Serenity. Shortly afterwards she flees the hospital and dies in a car crash.David Edmunds, white, parish priest, and his black Nigerian wife, Leila, are finding that their childlessness causes more problems than their mixed marriage. Desperate to have a family, they undergo IVF without success. As the book opens, an adoption process is under way.Jake Kelly, 40-year-old New Zealander, can\u2019t commit to his relationship with Anna, who wants a child before she gets too old. She decides to end their relationship and asks Jake to move out. On the same day, Jake quits his job as an investment banker. A colleague, Lucy, clever, attractive, invites him to her parents\u2019 home in the country for the weekend. Lucy\u2019s young half-brother, Matt, is into loud music and drugs.After the shocking opening, we become involved with two families \u2013 the Edmunds in their search for a child, and Lucy\u2019s family, the Harrisons, who draw Jake into their convoluted life and the secrets they are hiding. Why has Lucy\u2019s stepmother, Deborah, not returned from an assignment in Africa? Why is 16-year-old Matt so confused and desperate?Adoption is the theme of this book. The slightly clunky title, Freeing Grace, is explained late in the story during the adoption hearing that forms the climax.The main characters, with a strong supporting cast, are well drawn, credible and memorable. The story moves between the two families, following parallel paths, until finally they are brought together by baby Grace. The prose flows easily and we are always sure where we are and which thread we are following. Jake tells his story in the first person which further helps to keep the story on track.The plot is interesting, with many surprises. We go with Jake to Africa, briefly, in strong contrast to the cool, misty weather of the English countryside. The story is moving, funny and absorbing. It\u2019s up to date and relevant with its themes of childlessness, mixed marriage, prejudice, adoption, teenage pregnancy, drugs, alcohol and mental illness.Thoroughly recommended as an engaging, entertaining read, with enough depth to make you care about the characters. This is Charity Norman\u2019s first novel. I hope she writes more.Jo Rudd 28/5/2011"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/755892-jennifer", "userReview": "I'm a sucker for an adoption story, this much is true...but I did really enjoy this book. It is predictable in places, yes...but I thought it was a good story - with plenty of characters you either really loved or wanted to punch in the face.I'm grateful for the Easy Living review which is likely the only reason I would have ever come across this one.It did have me sniffling more than once on the Tube...I won't say if they were happy tears or sad tears, obviously...but regardless, it was emotional.Then again I can read or watch anything about adoption without crying...so I can't really be trusted, can I?"}, {"userName": "Victoria Scott", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11758600-victoria-scott", "userReview": "This book was so full of emotion, I loved it. There was a pretty stressful moral dilemma in this; give the baby to the birth family that doesn't really want it, or to adoptive parents that do? Can you really just take a baby away from it's family? By swapping between the perspectives of both sides, you really get to fall in love with everyone, and that makes the decision so much harder. Sometimes, I felt no doubt in who I wanted to get this baby, then I'd swap a few chapters later. What I do wish is that there was a little bit more of those sad scenes; I didn't cry once, and I fully expected to.

I loved it.At first I was unsure how the initial characters would fit together, but it soon became obvious. The books I enjoy most make me want to BE the women (or parts of them), or be best friends with them, or be adopted by them, and they make me want to marry the men, or be adopted by them, or adopt them. You get the picture. I felt very close to all the characters.Even the characters who had such huge flaws were still likeable, perhaps because of their flaws?! I felt invested in each person, even Hilda, the hideous mother-in-law, and her awful spouse Christopher. I know Monica and Nicky, even though they are minor characters, but Charity Norman writes so well, even Dora in the shop was 'visible' to me!I am personally fortunate not to have been in Leila's position, to yearn for a child that I can never have. I didn't have a teenage pregnancy, nor did I marry a widower. I'm not a Kiwi bloke who can't settle down. But through this novel I felt a lot of the characters emotions. It has helped me see things with a wider world view.I usually root for someone in this kind of book. With Jodi Picoult novels, it's apparent whose side you are on, for example. But this book just made me want to read on, to find out what happened, to find out how it would happen. Of course, it was so good, I was also trying to ration it, because I knew I would be bereft when I had read it all, and I would have to say goodbye to them all!I cannot recommend this highly enough. I found Charity Norman by accident on Amazon and I read Second Chances (After the fall) which I loved. Next I read her latest novel The Secret Life of Luke Livingstone (also wonderful) and I have The Son-in-law waiting. I daren't read it because then I will have nothing left to anticipate. That is how good her books are.

A baby, Grace, is at the centre of the drama where two families are in a struggle around her adoption. I enjoyed following their plight as each chapter switched between the two parallel families. After years of waiting, the childless couple made up of David, a curate, and his wife, are desperate to adopt Grace. Yet the teenage father, Matt Harrison, is not ready to let her go. Jake, a family friend of the Harrisons, becomes unwittingly drawn into the dark family secrets.Freeing Grace is a tale of hope, sadness and joy as the issues of teenage parenthood, mixed race marriages, adoption and religion are pondered when the two families strive to do what is best for Grace. Fans of Monica McInerney and Joanna Trollope will enjoy this compelling novel. The author, Charity Norman, is a barrister who was born in Uganda, lived in the UK and now lives in New Zealand."}, {"userName": "Steph Hall", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7922905-steph-hall", "userReview": "What a disappointment this book was, not in terms of story, which is usually the disappointment if a book isn't up to scratch, but in this case, it was in the writing which was of a very poor level. It was hard to \"bond\" with or believe the characters, and the general wordcraft and storytelling throughout was very basic, and frankly I'm surprised it was published in this form. Big shame as the actual story and the idea of the tussle between families wishing to keep Grace was a great idea - told by a master like Jodi Picoult for example, this book could have been a gripping bestseller from start to finish.Really not keen to bother with anything else from this author. Hopefully, she has improved her style and writing ability.

Unable to have children of their own, they're desperate for a family. When they finally hear they've been approved to adopt a baby, Grace, they can scarcely believe their good fortune. There's just one problem for which David and Leila cannot plan; Grace's birth family - the enigmatic, charismatic Harrisons. Enlisting their friend, the feckless, charming New Zealander, Jake Kelly - who's half in love with all of them, one way or another - the Harrisons send him on a quest that will force a confrontation. Ultimately, each has a terrible decision to make. Everyone only wants what's best for Grace - but who can say exactly what that is?After having read two more recent Charity Norman books which I loved I was pleased to find this book which was her first novel. All I can say is that her writing has greatly improved! I didn't feel engaged by any of the characters, the story was good but it lacked depth.

The story of David and his wife who wanted to adopt baby Grace was well told tho I could never feel any warmth for them and never wanted them to get the baby. What totally baffled me was why was what should have been Matts story of trying to get his daughter back and all his family dramas not recounted by Matt himself or at least a family member...instead bring in some random man called Jake who used to work with his sister and let him tell the story. I get that Jake was obv trying to find himself and he in different ways helped the family members but it was as if their lives depended on this complete stranger and I was baffled by it to be honest.It was simply a story turned into a bizarre weird retelling by a complete nobody!"}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7198747-kathy", "userReview": "After reading Second Chances by Charity Norman i very quickly bought Freeing Grace fully expecting this to be as outstanding as Second Chances.
