{"ratings": 0, "userreviews": [], "description": "In this invaluable contribution to the continuing debate about religious belief, David Adams Richards offers an exhilaratingly fresh perspective and a voice more impassioned, heartfelt, and sometimes furious, than anything written about God by an atheist.David Adams Richards, one of Canada\u2019s most beloved and celebrated authors, has been wrestling with questions of morality, faith, and religion ever since he was a child. They have always informed his fiction. Now he examines their role in his own life and spells out his own belief, in what is his most self-revealing work to date. With characteristic honesty, Richards charts his rocky relationship with his cradle Catholicism, his battles with personal demons, his encounters with men who were proud to be murderers, and the many times in his life when he has been witness to what he unapologetically calls miracles. In this subtly argued, highly personal polemic, David Adams Richards insists that the presence of God cannot be denied, and that many of those who espouse atheism also know that presence, though they would not admit it to anyone - including themselves. Every follower of today\u2019s battle between faith and atheism, and every lover of David Adams Richards\u2019 superb fiction, will find God Is revelatory. \u201cI believe that all of us, even those who are atheists, seek God - or at the very least not one of us would be unhappy if God appeared and told us that the universe was actually His creation. Oh, we might put Him on trial for making it so hard, and get angry at Him, too, but we would be very happy that He is here. Well, He is.\u201dQuestions of faith, morality, the role of unseen forces in our destinies, have been central to the fiction of David Adams Richards. Now he directly addresses what these questions have meant to him in his own life, and what he has come firmly to believe. He has always been a courageous and uncompromisingly honest writer - but never more so than here.", "title": "God Is: My Search for Faith in a Secular World", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29805268-god-is", "average": 0.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1461248145l/29805268.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/87458.David_Adams_Richards", "name": "David Adams Richards"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6485708.Bernard_Setaro_Clark", "name": "Bernard Setaro Clark"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29805268-god-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/151381.Mercy_Among_the_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110344.Nights_Below_Station_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110346.The_Friends_of_Meager_Fortune", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110347.River_of_the_Brokenhearted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425484.The_Bay_of_Love_and_Sorrows"]}
