Every page was breathtaking, whether it was the memory of the author as a child, lying under a starlit Alexandria sky with her grandmother on the 27th night of Ramadan, waiting for angels, or her many passages about her strained yet loving relationship with her mother. Leila Ahmed masterfully weaves history together with memory, and paints a picture of mid-20th century Egypt as a multilingual, religiously diverse nation unaffected by the tumultuous politics of the rest of the Middle East. And while I couldn't get enough of her beautiful childhood memories, the real worth of this novel comes from Ahmed's masterful deconstruction of the categorization of Egyptians as \"Arab.\" She's a fierce critic of Arab nationalism, and uses the entire novel as a prelude to the final section where she sheds light on the politics behind the notion of Arabness. This is one of the best memoirs I've ever read, and I'll probably pick it up again soon enough."}, {"userName": "Jacki", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1919428-jacki", "userReview": "A Border Passage is a personal memoir of Ahmed's childhood in Cairo, her academic life in England, and her professional life in America. She weaves a beautifual story of the impact of imperialism and the Eygptian revolutions on her life and the life of her family. She struggles with racism when there was no such word. She brings the reader to a place of contemplation as they begin to see the world from a non-Western point of view.Ahmed is a skilled writer, able to a story that is intriguing and extremely eye-opening for Western readers. Each page I turned I learned just a bit, leaving me questioning many of my own perceptions about my childhood and adult life.A Border Passage explores many topics, most interesting to myself was an examination of women's Islam and whether Eygptians should be grouped into the label of Arab. These are two topics which are rarely discussed at cocktail parties, at least not in the Midwest, but worth examining further.Highly recommended for anyone wishing to learn more about Eygpt, Islam, and want Westerner's consider the Arab world."}, {"userName": "Rubayya", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7620258-rubayya", "userReview": "This book is really, really good. It starts a little slow and muddled but the speed at which it progresses is reflective of the author's sharpening of her outlook and identity. Reading this book, I realized how similar the experience of growing up in a British colony, Egypt, is to growing up as an immigrant, minority, and Muslim in America. She vividly portrays a conflicted sense of self with which I can identify strongly and resolves her sense of conflict in a way that is healing, even to me.

It was the author's story essentially of the geography of her life, beginning in Cairo after WW2, when Egypt was still under British colonial rule. The author came from an upper class background, and discussed the ease and enjoyment of her early life. Then came the revolution, and things changed. Still, she was able to leave Egypt for an education, but at that point discovered that she was \"black\" - and not upper class British or French. She goes on to discuss the revelations of how race, ethnicity, gender, and social status affected not only her outlook on life, but the circumstances under which she lived. After earning her PhD she worked in Dubai, aiming to include women within the newly setup education system. This led her to Women's Studies which she taught in the US - learning that first world women have a different outlook from third world women on the meaning of this discipline. This particularly interested me as I remembered some of the newspaper articles from International Women's Year in 1975, discussing the dichotomy women's issues in the Western world vs. the third world.As I am currently unused to reading books without a mystery or plot, this took me extra effort and time to read. And in spite of the fact that I am also unused to reading books that challenge my intellect, I found the effort very worth while."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10873265-jeremy", "userReview": "Leila Ahmed is a terrific writer, but I have the same problems with her memoir that I have with memoirs in general. Memoirs, in my opinion, only work as a part of some larger context than one's self, and while Ahmed does better than most, she still gets bogged down in personal minutiae that bare little relevance to that context and, ultimately, bore the shit out of me. Her best work comes toward the end, when she really dug in to the point of her memoir: searching for her identity as a feminist Muslim at the end of European colonialism in Egypt. If she stuck more ardently to this context throughout, this book would have been a real winner."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/357213-melinda", "userReview": "This is an intellectually stimulating and beautifully memoir. It reflects the formative moments of Leila Ahmed's life while simultaneously investigating questions of imperialism, culture, religion, identity, feminism, race, literacy, politics, literature, Egypt, and Arabness at a level exceptionally perceptive and thorough. Ahmed draws a complex portrait of her childhood in Egypt and experiences in British academia. Her critical eye and articulate voice combine to form a rich memoir, one which perhaps leaves the reader with more questions that he or she started with, in realization of the complexity of the issues Ahmed takes on."}, {"userName": "Allison Le Grice", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6141961-allison-le-grice", "userReview": "Disappointing.

A Border Passage covers her education in England in 1960s along with her time serving on a committee \u201cto oversee the development and reform of education throughout the United Arab Emirates (UAE)\u201d in the late 1970s, a job she had ambivalent feeling about. Large parts of the book are on her ambivalent \u201con becoming an Arab\u201d. Before the rise of Arab nationalism in Egypt under President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Ahmed saw herself not as an Arab, but as an Egyptian. Ahmed is not against the use of \u201cArab\u201d as an identity, but how that \u201cArab\u201d identity has been used in Egypt politically, to exclude Egyptian Jews, Coptic Christians, and other non-Islamic \u201cArab\u201d peoples from the national narrative troubling. Ahmed finds the spread of pan-Arab \u201cstandard\u201d culture troubling. For example, during her time in the UAE, she found the local male in authority were much more open to women receiving education in science or engineering than her fellow non-Emirati Arab experts on the committee who were mainly Egyptians or Palestinians. I read the edition that had an afterword from 2012 that Ahmed response to the Arab Spring in Egypt and the role of Asma Mahfouz in those events. Ahmed\u2019s A Border Passage is an interesting book because Ahmed applies her gender and post-colonial studies background to her personal history."}, {"userName": "Adrianna Scibor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38072334-adrianna-scibor", "userReview": "Very well articulated thoughts and memories of a woman recounting her life as being born of two worlds in an Egypt much different than the one we know today. I admit it was hard to get through because I didn't understand her thinking at times but this book is a wonderful picture into the Egypt that once was. An Egypt more interested in being European.I have to say that some of the things about the author bothered me, for instance she could vividly recall sights and smells of her childhood home and of Cairo but could no remember the exact date of when her mother was born or when her Nanny or Father died. I understand that her mother did not want her altogether and it does not seem like she was very close with either of her parents but still. She had brothers and sisters and aunts to consult didn't she? Just like she gave up so quickly when trying to search for her parents graves at the cemetery...you could have gone back the next day and the next to make more of an effort. I don't know why this bothers me but it does.When she writes that now Egyptian people are so used to the idea of Egypt as an Arab nation that they never thought of themselves as any other way and her book shows how it was not always like this. I like that part because many people forget that detail. I also liked reading about her father and his role in studying and writing about the ecology of Egypt especially being against the Aswan dam which really has caused all the natural silt of the Nile to disappear.Overall, this was an interesting and eye-opening read and it gave me lots to mull over."}, {"userName": "Yasmine Flodin-Ali", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58932646-yasmine-flodin-ali", "userReview": "So thoughtful and lovely."}, {"userName": "Alisha Falberg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48252377-alisha-falberg", "userReview": "Waivered between 3 and 4 stars - very interesting and I learned a lot, but hard to get through at times."}, {"userName": "Amy Holiday", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4580179-amy-holiday", "userReview": "Full disclaimer: Memoir is not my favorite genre; far from it. I'd put it near the bottom, actually. (And I raised my review up one star because of this.) But books based in other cultures are near the top of my list, and the premise of a woman in the midst of a changing country really grabbed me. But, aside from the lovely language and the beautiful imagery, this book was a struggle for me. I'd compare Leila's upbringing to the daughter of a wealthy senator, or something (not meaning to westernize her life, just trying to relate it to my own experience.) I liked the beginning, and especially her discussion of her father's relationship to the changing government. That was fascinating, and again, it was beautifully written. But I think the story lost me when Leila was devastated (petulant?) about not getting to study in England as a teenager. Knowing she earned a doctorate from Cambridge and then went on to become a professor at Harvard Divinity School sort of made me lose interest in the teenage drama and the subsequent adult remorse. (Along with a little too much \"I don't remember why, but....\") Then it was requested on PaperbackSwap, so, off it went, when I was about halfway through.Incidentally, I began The Saffron Kitchen--fictional story about a woman in Iran, a few decades later--almost immediately after this one, but with the same reaction. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because I'm expecting different emotions due to the different setting, but in reality human nature remains the same across cultures, and all of our stories are similar. (To be fair, Western memoir isn't really my thing either!) Now I'm on the lookout for a middle-class, Middle-Eastern, Muslim woman's story that really grabs me!"}, {"userName": "Kristine Gift", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16104005-kristine-gift", "userReview": "Realistically, I would rate this 3.5/5 rather than simply 3, were that an option. I was assigned this book for a class I took three years ago about the history of the modern Middle East, but then it was removed from the syllabus before classes began. But at graduation, another professor gave me a new copy of this book, and I took it as a sign that I should finally read Ahmed's book. In short, I'm glad I did; it was enlightening and interesting (especially the chapter(s?) about her college/grad school years, and it raised a lot of interesting points of women, Islam, Arabness, and the way that people form their opinions on identity and nationalism, etc. To make a short review long however, I felt that this book was not organized the best way possible. Often, especially in the first half, things felt a little jumbled. Additionally, I wish the narrative had been more engaging, less \"I now realize that...\" statements; I like reflections, but they were just too frequent to be appreciated by the time I was half way through. ((Btw, the afterword is great, so pick up a copy with an afterword! She discusses briefly 9/11 and the Arab Spring, so if you enjoyed what she had to say (as I did) the afterword is worth a read.))Ahmed has a lot of good things to say and an interesting perspective, and while she doesn't encapsulate the experience of ALL Arab/Egyptian women, she represents herself very fairly, and if you don't go into the book with too many expectations, I think anyone interested in the Middle East and in women's studies will enjoy most -- if not all -- of Ahemd's written journey."}, {"userName": "Ph\u1ea1m N.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3102089-ph-m-n", "userReview": "1 among a few interesting passages I found so far: \"What was passed on, besides the general basic beliefs and moral ethos of Islam, which are also those of its sister monotheisms, was a way of being in the world. A way of holding oneself in the world - in relation to God, to existence, to other human beings. THis the women passed on to us most of all through how they were and by their being and presence, by the way they were in the world, conveying their beliefs, ways, thoughts, and how we should be in the world by a touch, a glance, a word - prohibiting, for instance, or approving. Their mere responses in this or that situation - a word, a shrug, even just their postures - passed on to us, in the way that women (and also men) have forever passed on to their young, how we should be. And all of these ways of passing on attitudes, morals, beliefs, knowledge - through touch and the body and in words spoken in the living moment - are by their very nature subtle and evanescent. They profoundly shape the next generation, but they do not leave a record in the way that someone writing a text about how to live or what to believe leaves a record. Nevertheless, they leave a far more important and, literally, more vital, living record.

Leila Ahmed is a wonderful scholar and has made innumerable contributions to the field of Middle Eastern/Islamic gender studies, but this book is alas not one of them. Although it is well-written, the subject is very boring. Ahmed gives us snippets of a half-remembered priveleged childhood that she couldn't wait to escape by moving to England. To her credit, I don't believe that she intended this book to reflect on all other Middle Eastern women -- but we have done a good enough job of it ourselves!Readers must be careful to acknowledge that Ahmed's experiences are her own, and her education set her apart from most of the society in which she lived, a fact that becomes clear in the book.

The book is a memoir of Leila Ahmed, an Egyptian author and feminist. It details her life beginning with the British occupation through current times. The book gives a glimpse of life for foreign students (for this woman, it was in England), and sheds light on Egypt's unique role in the Arab world. She also finishes with the feminist movement and her difficulty in relating this movement to a culture where women are rich in their historical and oral traditions yet so outwardly cloistered.The book is a little difficult to read in that the sentence structure and vocabulary are complex; but for anyone who has interest in Egypt or the Arab world, this book fills in a lot of information regarding life \"Post Ottoman\" through the development of the Arab League.

Sometimes she really went too far off into an academic discussion - but it was worth it. She explores ideas of Arab identity vs. Egyptian identity, oral traditions vs. written Islam, women's culture vs. men's culture, and what it means to be a non-European living in the west. It's the best discussion of the problem with traditional education and reliance on book learning that I've read.
