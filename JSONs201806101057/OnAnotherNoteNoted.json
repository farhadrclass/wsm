It starts with Jillian, a housekeeper, almost leaving her place of employment and the little cottage behind the house that she calls home. John, her employer, has finally decided to let Jillian into his heart despite the heartache that he's experienced.Could not get in to this book. I think it might be in part because I didn't read the first book. The books are set up like a continued story and I didn't realize that. The story line flows more like I'm reading a script that hasn't yet had the best actors picked out. So there are large portions of it that feel stiff or don't have any emotion attached. I couldn't get a feel for the characters and the plot was just a list of what was happening. I couldn't get pulled in, no matter how hard I tried. I'm sure that this story will appeal to someone, but it just wasn't me.I received a copy of this book from Goodreads. All thoughts expressed are my own."}, {"userName": "Lynn Mehringer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69965990-lynn-mehringer", "userReview": "I bought the first three books in the series all together, and once I started, I read all three in rapid succession. They are well written. Each one kept me interested and piqued my curiosity as to what would happen next. I love a good love story, and especially one with a Christian undertone. I highly recommend this read."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31794513-mary", "userReview": "On Another Note is a sweet and old fashioned love story that will speak to the heart.The story will captivate the reader as you enter the world of John and Jillian.The gentleness of love and faith are found within the pages of this beautiful book.I received On Another Note for free from Goodreads First Reads."}, {"userName": "Pam F", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23362368-pam-f", "userReview": "The second book in this series did not disappoint.
