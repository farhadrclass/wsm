I liked The Fallen Angels better. This may be due to the fact that I adored the French, gypsy hero, Gitan. He\u2019s smooth, stealthy, and highly dangerous. And one of the things I love about Cornwell\u2019s writing is that he shows you his hero is dangerous, he doesn\u2019t just tell you. Gitan can be quite cold blooded. You\u2019re never quite sure if Gitan is a good guy or a bad guy until the end. Yes, you know he\u2019s fond of heroine, but does his loyalty lie elsewhere?I love the way he\u2019s described in the book. Gitan leaned against the stones of the archway. Even in repose h was an impressive man with lithe, strong, animal elegance. His face, dark tanned, was thin and handsome. His eyes were light blue, an odd color for a man with such dark skin and black hair. The contrast made his eyes seem bright and piercing. In any crowd Gitan would be remarkable, but among these sweaty, tired people he was like a thoroughbred among mules. He seemed to look on them with an amused tolerance, as though all that he saw he judged against the unfair measure of his own competence. He was a man whose approval was constantly sought by other men.I kept thinking of Alain Delon. The heroine, Campion (who shares the same name as the heroine from A Crowning Mercy) is kind of nondescript, typical, beautiful and pretty much like the other Campion. I didn\u2019t dislike her, but I didn\u2019t think much about her either. One scene that cracked me up is she gets to thrash one of bad guys, literally. She has him bent over his desk, held by her servants and gives him a caning (which he had threatened to do with her. lolThe story does move slowly, but I liked all the French Revolution background and historical detail. I don\u2019t think these romances are as good as Cornwell\u2019s adventure stories, but I enjoyed them and I plan to read the third book. I think I will take a little break though before I crack open the last in the series. I\u2019ve read it has little to do with the first two."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3460352-sharon", "userReview": "This was a page turner. Had everything I like...non stop action, drama, twists and turns...characters who kept me guessing (not who they appeared to be)...suspense...with all the herrings thrown my way keeping me wondering just who the hell are these people? Who can I trust? I had no clue. The story started out in a violent nightmare of blood and gore as the 'republic' of the French Revolution was in full swing. Aristocrats were hunted, imprisoned and slaughtered....Not necessarily in that order. The guillotine was very busy. The Parisian's termed the beheading as 'sneezing into the basket' because of the similarity of sound the body made as the blade severed the head.Quickly the story moved to England for the beginning of it's Regency period. Toward the end, it moved back again to France so we reader's could witness the beheading of the King.Written by Cornwell, I wasn't sure what to expect from this story...or even if it would be a romance. There was so much intrigue/French and British spies/hidden identities/murder/deception/secret societies/lies/violence/murder...I had no idea who to trust. So I cheated 3/4's of the way through because I couldn't stand the suspense any longer. I rarely do this in a book but I scanned a few pages towards the end...I HAD TO KNOW. I was so caught up in adrenaline... without a clue... Well, when I cheat like that I'm always disgusted with myself and regret that I don't have that extra cell that will permit me to hold on just a little longer to get my answers. But, I don't have that cell. Damn.It turned out to be a romance...which I loved.

I expected better. Is it Cornwell or his wife that just doesn't get us to that place we have come to expect from Cornwell. Trite might be a description. Forgetable is probably what I am going to be left with on this one.The period is one of my favorites, it is the dawn of the regency era, when the terror is taking over France. Great we have seen this in before in such works as Dickens, [A Tale of Two Cities:], and in the Scarlett Pimpernel.With those classic examples, Cornwell should know that he has do as well as they, or better. He doesn't. We have a little princess of a heroine whose backbone is forced upon us. We have a transparent villian, and we have a hero who really shines as hero only through the mist colored eyes of a romance novel. So what is a novel from one of the premier historical novelists is rally a romance with a thin veneer of historical laced on it.Better has been done elsewhere. Can be skipped."}, {"userName": "Esther", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7689468-esther", "userReview": "Bernard Cornwell collaborated on this title with his wife Judy Cornwell, under the name Susannah Kells. It happens several generations after the events in \"A Crowning Mercy,\" although it was hard to tell exactly how many. It references quite a bit of the history from the first book, without really using it in any kind of a plot-important way. Which may be part of my disappointment. The other disappointment is that while the Cornwells appear to have done a lot of research on the Illuminati, there is not much depth to the major historical setting, namely France during the French Revolution. Yes, people are called \"Citizen,\" the guillotine appears, and so does the reference \"Sneezing into the Basket,\" but I really did not get a sense for France during that time, which is something I expect from a Cornwell book. Instead the main character agonizes internally over her perceived class difference with Gitan or \"The Gypsy\" and her (to all appearances) acceptable suitor, which all takes place in England- where apparently nothing historically significant is happening- except that the Illuminati are there, at least according to the book. We have an Uncle who is an refugee, and an absent brother to remind us about the Revolution. Unlike other readers, I did not see the big villain reveal coming at the very end, but on the whole the book was just not as intricate, historically driven and realistic as I expect a Cornwell book to be. It's also a lot shorter.All that being said, if you are looking for a fast, fun read that is a little heavy on the romance, light on the history, hefty on conspiracies, with a bit of grit and gore thrown in, it's still OK. Just don't expect a hard hitter."}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7814208-betty", "userReview": "I listened to this as an audio book and the reader was Anna Bentick who really brought it to live.

Historical fiction is one of my favorite genres and The Fallen Angels had everything a great historical fiction novel should have. I didn't realize this was only book 2 of a series until I found it on Goodreads; however, this book has enough power to stand on its own in the historical fiction/romance world.I would love to get my hands on the first novel in this Crowning Mercy series, and any others that followed after The Fallen Angels :) Each character was superbly written, from the villains to the heroes. I absolutely loved hating the members of the secret society known as the \"The Fallen Angles\" who wanted nothing but to see Britain's aristocracy fall during the French Revolution, and how evil, manipulative and twisted they were. The romance that grows between Gitan the Gypsy and Lady Campion Lazender is a romance for the ages, one of the best in my opinion. And lastly, the historical detail of France, of Britain and the life of an aristocrat, and the life and ways of the \"Romani\" or gypsy people was extremely entertaining and enjoyable. Overall, I truly loved this book! A pure gem of a story and one I couldn't stop thinking about even after I finished the last page. Definitely one I would read a second or third time. :)"}, {"userName": "Dark-Draco", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18484922-dark-draco", "userReview": "This is a much, much darker story than the first book - and I have to say I liked it a little better! Where the first book was first a love story and secondly an action-packed thriller, this one was more of the latter, with a bit of mystery and a love story running alongside.At first it was hard to get my head out of the first book, as the characters in this one have the same names, passed down through the generations. But once that was realised and absorbed, I found myself enjoying this story immensely.The mystery surrounds a secret society who are instrumental in the plot to bring down the French Aristocrats during the revolution, but they need money and the Lazen fortune would be perfect. Planning to kill the heirs one by one until they can control the weakest, they underestimate just how strong Toby and his sister, Campion, can be. Of course, as the book unfolds, you come to understand that there is a more personal reason that the Angels are focused on that particular family.Well written, as are all Cornwell's books, and the last few chapters have to be read in one sitting - you won't have a choice anyway! They are fantastically written and, just like in the first novel, you are never quite sure whose side everyone is on. The one major twist wasn't really that much of a shock, but I still enjoyed the unmasking of the betrayer."}, {"userName": "Plum-crazy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30347735-plum-crazy", "userReview": "Well it's over 5 years since I read \"A Crowning Mercy\" & I seemed to think that Campion had met the love-of-her-life in that but here she is still not wed. As is ever the way, the path of true love doesn't run smooth but it does mean that early in the tale there some so romantic scenes between Campion & the Gypsy -(well I thought so anyway!)

I like how the authors have created a sequel that is set in a different era, with brand new characters, yet manage to link this book back to its predecessor. Whereas Book 1 had lots of conflict and dramatic situations, this second book starts out in a similar fashion, yet for most of the middle section it strikes me as lacklustre in some way. The last few chapters pick up the pace again, though they neither match the opening scenes, nor come close to the final stages in the first novel.Both novels feature a heroine named Campion, with the Campion of this tale being the great-great granddaughter of the former. They are similar in appearance and personality, yet the first Campion appealed to me more.Aspects that make this book lack sparkle is the amount of repetition and the overuse of adjectives. English style often gets overlooked in historical fiction, as most authors in this genre put all their efforts into researching the past. Content and style should complement each other. Quite often a character is described with two or three adjectives when one would\u2019ve sufficed. There\u2019s a point where the character Gitan is introduced as wearing black. This information is followed up by listing all the characters garments, each of which is preceded by the word \u201cblack\u201d, thus we have an overflow of adjectives and needless repetition. What particularly annoyed me was the overuse of the phrases, \u201che/she smiled\u201d, \u201che/she laughed\u201d. One or both of these are used during almost every character interaction. This stands out more and more as the story progresses, slowing the narrative down, when in most cases the reader can imagine whether a character would smile or laugh by the context of the sentence, like with the following two:>He smiled at her. 'It's going to be all right.'>Her face was frowning. 'But what if he can't unblock the tunnel?'As a rule, if a person tells someone that things will be all right, they say it with a smile. The second sentence is Campion expressing concern, thus it\u2019s obvious what her face is doing. These additions to the dialogue, of which there are many, serve no purpose other than providing an unwanted distraction.I do greatly admire Bernard Cornwell\u2019s authorship, but in every book of his that I\u2019ve read so far his weak point is always dialogue attribution. The dialogue itself is good, but he slows it down, distracting the reader with things like in the sentences above, or telling the reader which character is speaking when it\u2019s obvious who it is.Anyway, despite these minus points, the good parts really are good, thus it just about deserves four stars."}, {"userName": "Ambre", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5340558-ambre", "userReview": "I really enjoyed these books. Unlike Cornwell's usual, these are historical romances and are more loosely historical. However, his talent for historical detail still comes through loud and clear. One downside to this second book is a weakness that I have recognized in his series. He develops a plot formula and sticks too tightly to it, making things increasingly predictable. There would have been a lot more suspense in this book if he had not stuck with the pattern of the first book in the series. I can see how this book might suffer genre confusion. It may not appeal to his usual fans because of the female focus contributed by his wife, straying from history, and few battle scenes. On the other hand, historical romance fans might not appreciate his blunt portrayal of the less romantic side of history. But personally? I am a fan of his other work and thoroughly enjoyed the romantic twist added by the collaboration."}, {"userName": "Elli", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4199685-elli", "userReview": "I like Bernard Cornwell's books. No matter what the period or the subject theme, he seems easily to relate to. And his characters are generally effective as needs be to picture the story. The heroine is a strong woman and has on her hands that really demands alot of strength and daring. The setting is right before and at the beginning of the French Revolution which, of course has its effect on the English, too, as well as the rest of Europe. And the ancestral estate which is part of the heroine's background in France. Fast moving, fast action. I choose 4 starts both because it is fast moving, realistic, and easy to relate to.
