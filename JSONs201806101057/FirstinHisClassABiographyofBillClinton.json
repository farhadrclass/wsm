While most politicians manage to antagonize one side or the other (or both), feelings about the Clintons are hyper-ventilated. Many people fall into one of two camps: the Clintons are evil and represent all that is wrong with politics, or they are two people who have devoted their lives to serving the public and making things better for working-class Americans. One of the reasons that David Maraniss's biography of the early Bill Clinton is so engrossing is because he neither has an ax to grind with the Clintons, nor does he think that either of them are remotely close to pillars of virtue. This book was written during Clinton's presidency, in the mid 1990s, and takes us only through Clinton's decision to formally announce his candidacy for the presidency on 10/3/91. Maraniss focuses on who Bill Clinton really is, or perhaps a better way to phrase it is that he tries to focus on who Bill Clinton really is. As Maraniss notes, Clinton (and Hillary too later on in the book) is a rash of contradictions: someone equally at home in a rural black church or playing golf at a ritzy country club where all the members are white. Clinton was constantly seeking the middle ground with people, something which was a harbinger of what he tried to do later as president.Maraniss begins by discussing the death of Clinton's father, William Blythe, in an auto accident before Clinton is even born. As one can imagine, this has a profound effect on Clinton's life (he was born William Jefferson Blythe but later legally changed his last name to Clinton) as he grew up without a father. This caused Clinton to continually seek out potential father figures as he grew up and even when he was a young adult. While his fun-loving mother, Virginia, remarried, Clinton had an uneasy relationship with his alcoholic and abusive step-father Roger Clinton. This affected Clinton too - probably much more so than he let on with friends as he would talk about his biological father's death buy kept fairly mum about Roger Clinton and his excesses. From boyhood, Clinton alternately attracted and repelled people. Many people were drawn into his orbit by his charm and charisma. Others were put off by his glad-handing and apparent deviousness. Maraniss traces these qualities through Clinton's youth in Hope and then Hot Springs, his high school years, his college years at Georgetown, then Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, and then Yale Law School, and then throughout his rise in Arkansas politics. One quality that Maraniss notes but does not dwell upon is the penchant that Clinton had (and probably still has) for distancing himself from someone once that person is no longer of much use to him. This is especially true when Clinton was a young governor in Arkansas, willing to sacrifice staff members in order to push blame for something off of himself and onto them. I remember this trait coming up while I was reading Dan Balz's book about the 2008 presidential primaries and election, when he was describing Bill's forlorn efforts to help Hillary try to win the Democratic nomination. It is just something that stuck out to me from my reading that book, and Maraniss happened to hit on the same trait. This is an excellent, non-partisan look at the rise of Bill Clinton (and Hillary as well). Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Clintons, presidential biographies, or Arkansas politics.

It really seems like Bill was shooting for the presidency from about age twelve. He seems to have been sorta like Lyndon Johnson; from what I gathered from reading this and a bio of LBJ, both of these guys were born to be politicians, always working the room and keeping tabs on people and figuring out how they are going to run the next campaign. One bonus about this book is that it also serves as a partial biography of Hillary (though obviously there isn't as much about her as there is about Bill). This was written in the mid 90s, and Maraniss writes several times about how people thought Hillary could have had just as successful a political career as Bill, and how she was a better law professor and maybe even a better student, but she sacrificed some independence and moved to Arkansas and attached herself to him. Of course today we know that she would become Senator Clinton and Secretary of State Clinton and almost President Clinton herself, but back then she seemed to have made the decision that it would be all about Bill and his rise."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan", "userReview": "An excellent objective biography of Bill Clinton from the Pulitzer Prize Winning author David Maraniss. This biography was published in 1995 and covers Clinton's life up to his Presidential campaign announcement in 1991. If you want a better understanding of the genesis of Bill Clinton as an intellectual and a politician, along with all the warts, then this is a fascinating book. I would break down the book as follows:1. An early father-less childhood raised by a praise-heaping mother Virginia with problems and loving grandparents and then eventually a troubled and alcoholic step-father. 2. An ambitious, brilliant and politically motivated teenager elected as one of two Arkansas Boy's State Senators who then traveled to Washington D.C. where he dazzled congressmen and shook John F. Kennedy's hand. 3. A well liked Georgetown college student who stayed very active in politics and worked in the back office of congressional offices4. Ongoing maneuvers and connections that allowed him to evade the Vietnam War draft. This section coincided with his time as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and his travels throughout Europe including Russia. 5. Yale Law School student where he met Hillary.6. An early law school faculty position in Fayatteville and then marriage to Hillary.7. An attorney general position and first governorship and Hillary's involvement in commodities trading, Whitewater deals etc. Increasing concern about his sexual dalliances. 8. More campaigning and then highly popular terms as a second go-around governor. A rise to national prominence where he passed on a run for the presidency in 1988 due to the recent sexual allegations. 9. Polling and decision to run for President in 1992. The writing in this book was highly prescient. Many of the self-inflicted problems that Bill and Hillary created later in their careers are foreshadowed in this book. Bill's sexual liaisons foreshadowed the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Bill's ability to wiggle out of the worst public scandals were already well honed before he entered law school. Hillary's public face and support of Bill despite dozens of allegations of marital misconduct and Bill's seeming inability to reform were front and center. Bill's lack of interest outside of politics and general boredom but unbridled energy, Hillary's financial insecurities, their joint desire to make huge impacts on the world were all there long before the Clinton Foundation. Also on display later in the book were many of Hillary's positive attributes; hard work, dogged determination, perseverance in spite of the double standards. But there were many prescient episodes of tone deafness on her part as well. In the fall of 2016 during the last days of the campaign, I heard a lot of comments from those people that I grew up with in Michigan that there weren't any good candidates. As I made the drive along the backroads from the U.P. of Michigan to Colorado, I only saw one \"Vote for Hillary\" sign that I remember. Record numbers of people it seemed didn't like either candidate but in the rural areas that I drove through it was far worse for Hillary. If you consider Bill and Hillary as a package as many Americans do, then I think this book at least hints at some of these feelings that have been there for decades, rightly or wrongly."}, {"userName": "Prateek", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234270-prateek", "userReview": "I find Bill Clinton endlessly fascinating. Much of my fascination comes from the character that emerges from this biography. From the first sentences, we're invited into a life that has no parallel in modern American history. His father dead, raised by a young free-spirited mother, Bill seems destined to follow the path of so many other poor southern boy. Raised amidst domestic violence (much more harrowing than reported), Bill Clinton develops into a bright, eager-to-please man on the make. The portrait is balanced -- his genuine care for policy and the \"little guy\" are presented alongside his reckless philandering. This book probes more deeply into this dichotomy than the president\u2019s own (highly readable) memoir."}, {"userName": "Scott Cox", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21638774-scott-cox", "userReview": "When I purchased Maraniss\u2019 biography, I didn\u2019t realize that it did not cover President Bill Clinton\u2019s tenure in office as 42nd President of the United States. This lengthy biography (464 pages) takes the reader to the point in Clinton\u2019s life where, as governor of Arkansas, he makes his momentous announcement that he will run for President in 1992. William Jefferson Blythe was born in Hope Arkansas in 1946. Blythe never met his biological father who was killed in a car accident before he was born. His mother soon remarried a hard-drinking, car dealer, Roger Clinton. Clinton never adopted his stepson, however years later Bill legally changed his name to show solidarity with his younger step brother, Roger Clinton. Bill did well in high school academics, and excelled as a saxophone player in the school band. One of his crowning moments was when he met and shook the hand of John F. Kennedy as a 17 year-old delegate to the American League Boy\u2019s Nation. Clinton subsequently attended Georgetown University, where the author noted he was \u201cfirst in his class in terms of political will and skill.\u201d Clinton went on to secure a Rhode\u2019s scholarship allowing him to study two years at Oxford College in England. These were also the tumultuous Vietnam War years. Being strongly against the war, Clinton managed to avoid the draft by deftly maneuvering between a purported graduate ROTC program and a high draft lottery number. After Oxford, Clinton returned to the States to complete Yale law school. At Yale he met Hillary Rodham, who was his intellectual match and complemented Clinton in political shrewdness. While Clinton excelled at story telling and gregariousness, Rodham was financially astute and disciplined. Hillary married Bill Clinton with \u201copen eyes\u201d regarding Bill\u2019s notorious philandering, however they were both committed to a political partnership that would benefit them. Clinton became the multi-term governor of Arkansas on a platform of \u201cjobs creation, education reform, and an overhaul of the welfare system.\u201d This platform would service him well in his upcoming campaign against President George Bush. This was a good \u201cearly life\u201d biography, however I felt the author was perhaps a little too lenient on Clinton\u2019s weaknesses, especially his philandering tendencies. Clinton was no less immoral than previous Presidents (especially Kennedy and Johnson), however the author failed to develop these tendencies in the same thorough manner as other biographers might have done. Otherwise, this was an insightful character study of a soon-to-be President."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/160142-joe", "userReview": "Clinton's life up to running for president: here, you have the Rhodes scholar, the law student, law teacher, his first campaigns, and other chapters. Hillary also gets good coverage, especially in contrast with Bill (Hillary is the harder, financial minded one, while Bill is portrayed as softer). This is also about the Baby Boomer generation: that's the \"class\" in the title, so there is a focus on Clinton's life as representative of the challenges faced by the generation that was drafted to go to Vietnam."}, {"userName": "Po", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/998377-po", "userReview": "Okay, the only reason this is on here is that Nate made me read it-in the 7th grade!!-b/c he didn't want to waste his time on it if it wasn't any good.

This book chronicles Clinton's growing up in Arkansas, his attending Boy's State, band competitions and dating Arkansas beauty queens. Maraniss describes Clinton as a good student who was always involved in student government & band and who was a regular over-achiever. This book also covers Clinton\u2019s attendance at Georgetown, including his formative experiences, professors and running for office. It recounts his attendance at Oxford, Yale, his meeting Hillary Rodham, his avoidance of the Vietnam War and his European travels. It also discusses his working for Senator Fulbright and how he would bust out singing Elvis songs while working at the Capitol. One interesting insight comes by way of Marannis\u2019s discussion of many of Clinton\u2019s young contemporaries and how Clinton was a part of the \"Class of \u201868\" but was amongst a group who, while believing in dramatic change, felt it must be done within the existing system (rather than doing away with the system per se).Some of the best parts of this book are about Clinton's younger days and it recounts his running for Congress, AG and Governor of Arkansas. One of my favorite stories was (as I recall) of Clinton vetoing (or not vetoing) a bill as Governor. A certain person or interest group was not happy with the outcome and persuaded Clinton to change his mind. It was after hours and the bill had already been shoved under a door per procedure. So they got a coat hanger and got the bill back out from underneath the door and Clinton made the desired change. ."}, {"userName": "Keith Rackley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1333973-keith-rackley", "userReview": "Maraniss documents, in rich detail, the genesis and life of a complex, gifted, and flawed individual. There is balance in his presentation. He portrays Clinton as extraordinarily gifted, with IQ and EQ, making him the perfect politician; Clinton demonstrates an amazing ability to connect with every person he meets and still be a policy wonk. Despite Clinton's amazing gifts leading to Oxford and Yale success, as well as his early life political conquests, the seeds of the most difficult chapters of his life are evident early. The author explores the origins and the evolution of trust issues, the darker side of a tendency to manipulate, and the womanizing.With all of the gifts Clinton has and the time he comes of age, it is difficult not to think of Malcolm's \"Outliers\". There is a very real thread in Clinton's history of being in the right place, at the right time, even with an admission that he would make the most of those opportunities. I would recommend this strongly to anyone who has interest in Clinton or the times in which he matured. My only complaint is that the timeline covered fails short of Clinton's presidency. I only hope that Maraniss will have a follow-on work, with more depth, than his easily panned \"The Clinton Enigma\"."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1504839-patricia", "userReview": "After reading a biography of Obama, I started researching biographies on other Presidents. I downloaded several to my Kindle, and this is the first one I'm reading. While the writing is no where near the quality of that of David Remnick's in The Bridge, I am nevertheless fascinated. Since Clinton is only a two years older than me, the historical context is real and vivid. Since he grew up in the South as did my ex-husband, I can't help but notice parallels there as well. The writing is clunky, but the research seems thorough and I got quite a bit of what I was looking for--i.e. a peek at the boy, youth, man who became president. There were times when I felt hoodwinked by a smooth talker back when I voted for him to be president. There's no doubt he is a flawed human being as are we all. This begs the question: How do one's flaws inform one's actions as a political leader for better or worse. Since this book only takes the reader to the moment when he announced his candidacy for presidency, I don't have the information that might answer this question with regard to Clinton. In my quest to learn more about presidents, I think I'll have to read another book on Clinton, this time one that focuses on his presidency."}, {"userName": "Diener", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1395533-diener", "userReview": "In 1992, I was a college freshman voting for the first time. I initially supported Perot because he was from my hometown of Dallas (not a good reason I guess), but switched to Clinton after Perot dropped out for a few weeks. The 90s represent a most excellent time in my life and because Bill was president during that time I associate him with all of the things that made my 90s so good - Nirvana, three Super Bowl wins for the Cowboys, living out my dream of becoming a sportswriter, traveling abroad, meeting Lefty (the best dog I will ever have), and, at decade's end, meeting my wife. This book has nothing to do with that time in my life. It is not about the Clinton presidency, but about Clinton's life before he became president. Found it very interesting. Clinton is the quintessential political animal, which makes him deplorable, but at the same time, his keen intellect and lifelong interest in books and learning fascinate me."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9304327-stephanie", "userReview": "This is a fascinating read and take on the Force that is Bill Clinton. The most interesting part of the book to me was a surprise: it was reliving the Vietnam years and their effect on Clinton and his peer group (to which I belong). Maraniss's recounting of the frustration we felt made me relive the entire rotten time--his narrative was a true and effective recounting of that time. The most surprising part of the book to me was that Clinton knew and advertised from such an early age that he intended to make a life of politics.

Maraniss actually has me thinking there are ways I need to be more like Bill Clinton, especially his attention to details of others\u2019 lives.
