Her family split their time in Boston while summering in south Bostwick, Maine. Jewett exhibited that she wanted to be a writer early on, and, after striking up a friendship with editor William Dean Howells, her stories began to appear in the Atlantic. Her most famous collection of stories, which can also be known as a novella and has gained inclusion in 500 Great Books By Women by Erica Bauermeister, is The Country of the Pointed Firs, detailing a summer that Jewett spent in fictional Dunnett's Landing, Maine. Although the narrator is not Jewett by name, the story details time she enjoyed in a similar setting. Willa Cather calls The Country of Pointed Firs one of the top three American books that she read, and Cather even edited a later edition of the book. Dunnett's Landing and her inhabitants, even without Cather's editing skills, are worthy of their place as quality women's literature. The quaint village of Dunnett's Landing is a lovely way to pass a summer afternoon. A narrator who may or may not be Jewett has chosen to pass her summer as a lodger at the home of Almira Todd, a sixty seven year old widow. Todd chose never to remarry and is by definition a strong female protagonist. She is a medicine woman and knows everything about all the flora and fauna in the area, assisting the town doctor in most cases. She is also related to most people in the are as her mother's people, the Bowdens, have called northern Maine home for five generations, preceding the revolution. Through Mrs Todd, we hear many yarns of oral history. Whether it is a story about sailing or whaling, foraging for plant life, or the many relatives Mrs Todd has in the area, we see that she is both a walking history book and charming older woman who our narrator is happy to call a friend. As there are few books featuring strong older female characters, I was easily enamored with Mrs Todd's character.Almira Todd is hardly the only dynamic woman featured in this novella. Todd's close friend Susan Bostwick is the only survivor out of nine siblings. Bostwick comes from a sea faring family that spent as much time at sea as on land, and she and Todd have known each other since they began school. Together, they regale the narrator with wonderful stories and it is apparent that they enjoy an enriching friendship. Yet, no woman in this novella charmed me as much as Todd's mother, eighty six year old Mrs Blackett. An independent woman if there ever was one, Mrs Blackett has chosen to live in a cottage on Green Island with her confirmed bachelor son William. Content with her station in life, Mrs Blackett shows the exuberance of youth and hardly seems older than her daughter Mrs Todd. The two women appear as siblings rather than a mother and daughter, giving credence to the adage that age is but a number. In the case of Mrs Blackett, it appears as though her best days could still be ahead of her.In addition the strong female protagonists, I fell in love with Dunnett's Landing, Maine. I spent many vacations in Door County, Wisconsin, and the heavy foliage along with lakeside air and diet heavy on fish boils and cherry pie are similar in character to Dunnett's Landing. The villages are based on fishing and summer homes, and the fir and other trees create a setting that evokes late nights on a porch, reminiscing about time gone by. Jewett enjoyed quality female friendships, and got the idea for Dunnett's Landing after spending a month with a friend in a Maine seaside village. Even though she wintered in the Boston area, Maine held a special place for Jewett as she revisited the characters and setting in later stories. Some editions of the book include these stories including a short story entitled William's Wedding. In all of the yarns, the sea is calm, the foliage is luscious, and Jewett's character descriptions are as though the reader has been acquainted with them for their entire lives.The Country of Pointed Firs is a quality way to spend a summer afternoon. It evokes time spent on vacation in the country with dear family and friends. Because Jewett's writing is full of strong female characters, it can also be considered early feminist literature. Yet, this writing contains no conflict, as not one character can be considered an antagonist. Perhaps, this can also be true of Jewett's life full of female friendship and little hardship until she fell ill right before her passing. As such, I would be interested in reading Jewett's other stories, especially her previous work appearing in the Atlantic. The Country of Pointed Firs has been a lovely way to spend a summer day, as this enriching novella rates 4 solid stars."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "This short story sequence bored me out of my mind. Other reviewers state that this book appeals to an older, more experienced audience, though I hope I do not have to reread this in my old age. Sarah Orne Jewett's acclaimed novel follows a young writer who spends a summer in Dunnet Landing, Maine. There, she befriends various townsfolk and notices the decline of the Coastal New England town itself. While perhaps there is something to be said about how Jewett eschews typical plot constructions in The Country of the Pointed Firs, I could not find anything exciting or rewarding about this book. Jewett includes some meaningful observations about friendship and time passing, but I have come across these same sentiments in works of overall higher quality. Maybe those who come from a small town or are interested in the history of New England would like this one more than I did."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "My note to myself, since I've tried keeping better track of why I add books to my tbr list, is that I first learned about this book in Spinster: Making a Life of One's Own by Kate Bolick. It makes sense, as the \"Mrs. Todd\" of this book is a wonderful example of a woman living on her own and is quite satisfied, thank you very much. The narrator of this book is a younger woman, boarding with Mrs. Todd so she can work on her writing, and she also qualifies for the spinster test (in Bolick's definition.)

Composed of a series of vignettes that are bound together by an overstory of a young lady spending the summer in Dunnet Landing, Maine. Jewett does a spectacular job of portraying the people who populate this seafarer's town and its neighboring islands. She captures both their relationships and sense of community and their naturally reticent and independent natures. Every occupant of this town has his own unique tale, and while there is no driving plotline, but more a kind of folklore that is being passed, reminiscent of The Canterbury Tales but even less plot-driven than that. I felt amazingly attached and involved with these people, even though they might only make an appearance in one chapter and then fade from view in the next.The descriptions Jewett offers of both the land and its people are astoundingly visual:\"A long time before we landed at Green Island we could see the small white house, standing high like a beacon, where Mrs. Todd was born and where her mother lived, on a green slope above the water, with dark spruce woods still higher.\"\"I wondered, as I looked at him, if he had sprung from a line of ministers, he had the refinement of look and air of command which are the heritage of the old ecclesiastical families of New England. But as Darwin says in his autobiography, 'there is no such king as a sea-captain.'\"And, she sprinkles some astute observations among her flowing descriptions of the land and its people:\"Conversation's got to have some root in the past, or else you've got to explain every remark you make, an' it wears a person out.\" If you have a friend who has been with you since childhood, or a sibling with which you are very close, you will understand this perfectly. No new friend can fill that same purpose because with the old friend or sibling no explanation is necessary and with the new friend no amount of explanation could be enough.\"There, you never get over bein' a child long's you have a mother to go to.\" Again, if you have lost a mother you know the truth of this statement. While your mother lives there is always \"home\".I have long wanted to read this book, having come across an excerpt from it years ago in a Victorian magazine. I was not disappointed. It roused a kind of nostalgia in me for a time and place I have never known but would love to be a part of. It suggests a kind of serenity, camaraderie, industry and love of life that is often sorely missing from our modern existence. The closest modern-era book I have found to this is At Home in Mitford."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 5* of fiveMy review is live today at Expendable Mudge Muses Aloud.

It makes me realize how favorite books fit one's age. when I was 18, I was forced to read Pride and Prejudice. Hated it. At 23 in grad school. Hated it. At 35, a friend said: \"You really should give it a try.\" Loved it. So, since the book didn't change, that means I did. As a writer of young adult fiction, this is actually quite encouraging. I'm not a great writer for adults, but I can be a great writer for a 15 year old. So that becomes my goal--not to aspire to something that is beyond my skill level, but to take the gift I have and try to do the best I can for the audience I have.  One other thought on this book. Walden comes to mind as a companion, and in many ways Walden is the greater book. Yet for pure enjoyment, I suspect the vast majority of readers would prefer this one.  Great ending . . . impressive passages on friendship, time, gardening, the sea.

The Backward View Such adorable stories are a true comfort reading.Note:SARAH ORNE JEWETT (1849-1909) was born and died in South Berwick, Maine. Her father was the region's most distinguished doctor and, as a child, Jewett often accompanied him on his round of patient visits. She began writing poetry at an early age and when she was only 19 her short story \"Mr. Bruce\" was accepted by the Atlantic Monthly. Her association with that magazine continued, and William Dean Howells, who was editor at that time, encouraged her to publish her first book, Deephaven (1877), a collection of sketches published earlier in the Atlantic Monthly. Through her friendship with Howells, Jewett became acquainted with Boston's literary elite, including Annie Fields, with whom she developed one of the most intimate and lasting relationships of her life.The Country of the Pointed Firs (1896) is considered Jewett's finest work, described by Henry James as her \"beautiful little quantum of achievement.\" Despite James's diminutives, the novel remains a classic. Because it is loosely structured, many critics view the book not as a novel, but a series of sketches; however, its structure is unified through both setting and theme. Jewett herself felt that her strengths as a writer lay not in plot development or dramatic tension, but in character development. Indeed, she determined early in her career to preserve a disappearing way of life, and her novel can be read as a study of the effects of isolation and hardship on the inhabitants who lived in the decaying fishing villages along the Maine coast.Jewett died in 1909, eight years after an accident that effectively ended her writing career. Her reputation had grown during her lifetime, extending far beyond the bounds of the New England she loved."}, {"userName": "janine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4893033-janine", "userReview": "The Country of the Pointed Firs is a very quiet novella. It doesn't really even have a plot. Yet somehow Jewett pulls off a masterful work of rumination and lazy summer days, set in rural coastal Maine. This novella's triumph -- it was published originally in 1896 -- is its resistance to the oncoming onslaught of railroad and stylish magazine homogeneity encouraged among American people and places alike.It's slow going with this novella at first, but, sure enough, by the turn of the last page I found myself very moved. Jewett's descriptions of the slowly decaying fishing village of Dunnet reminded me a lot of my current home in coastal Southeast Alaska (down to the detail of the spruce beer), and I related with the anonymous narrator's status as an outsider. The experience of reading this book was something like listening to conversation between offbeat characters or watching bees fly around above a field.

I'm sure reading that made all the difference. Reading an old mm pb or gutenberg on the e-reader would not have felt meaningful, or given me the experience of giving Jewett's words & ideas the consideration they deserved.So, I'm glad. I'm glad I got to know this little fishing village in Maine, of over 100 years ago. What interesting people, talking even then about the way of life they were saying goodbye to. Unfortunately for me there was almost nothing about the fish, or wildlife, not even much about the herbs that Mrs. Todd used in her potions and balms. Hm... come to think of it, it's interesting that she was just another neighbor with a talent, whereas so much stale historical fiction would tend to assume she'd be viewed as a witch.I don't feel the need to reread or recommend this, but I am giving it to my mother."}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "I agree with Willa Cather that reading this book is kind of like watching paint dry.

I can think of no others that confront time and change so serenely.An unnamed female narrator, probably in her 30s, spends a summer in a small Maine coastal town and describes her interactions and increasing emotional connections with the salt-of-the-earth locals. The novella is followed by four \"stories,\" but they all share the same narrator and cast of characters so we might as well consider them altogether a novel.

The shy older brother with his own, unsuspected story. The woman who is the Queen's twin. The tragic hermit, living alone on her island.

Always there, in my mind, a place to get to if I can pry myself away from the west edge of the continent to go to the east edge though I wish I could visit when Jewett wrote this book, describing another edge, the quiet ending of another time on the coast of Maine when quiet boats of all kinds left at dawn to fish while people exchanged produce, wares, herbs, in a time where everyone was a spoke in the wheel of life, connected to one another in some way. The Country of Pointed Firs gently, airily, sensitively documents the end of this simple time...No one really wants to hear your sea-faring stories anymore, old captain, rough seas, rescues, strange fish--now permanently grounded by yourself in your little wood house on the hill or Joanna who takes her broken heart off to an island, geographically and psychologically, soon to become legend. Is that her on the hill gathering wildflowers? Shouldn't we slow down the boat and throw her out some oranges? The book is really about the subtle beauty and quiet of that time, of the people, the land, the sea, how they all weave together in their poignant understated way all the while portending the loss of this way of life.

In Jewett, one of the lifelong sailors is described as a great reader all his life, which addled his brains a bit. Can this be said of modern sailors?

It is a short little book with a nameless narrator who spends the summer off the coast of Maine in search for what she thought would be some solitude, when what she discovered was that what she really needed was what she found: love and kindness and family in the form of all the characters she came across who were living on these small islands. Every chapter tells the story of another character, very intimate stories of love and loss and regret and joy. There is no plot to this story, but lots of descriptive narrative which makes one want to take a vacation just like this. It's a lovely little book and I would only recommend seasoned readers to give this a go because it feels a little dry at first and takes some patience in getting all the way through it."}, {"userName": "Reid", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6903379-reid", "userReview": "Like sands through the hour glass...\"Now and then a bee blundered in and took me for an enemy; but there was a useful stick upon the teacher's desk, and I rapped to call the bees to order as if they were unruly scholars, or waved them away from their riots over the ink...

As Fiction. O. Matthiessen pointed out, \u201cin these loosely connected sketches, she has acquired a structure independent of plot. Her scaffolding is simply the unity of her vision.\u201d Her vision was of a gentle and generous people on a rugged and dangerous coast, of New England character and \u201ccharacters\u201d limned in colors of high summer and blue skies. Here, too, you will meet the people of Dunnet\u2019s landing; the women, who are probably the most unforgettable characters of her book; and Elijah Tilley (among the very few men in Jewett\u2019s cast) who, after the death of his wife, learns the skills of husband and wife, of farm and sea. The black-and-white pencil drawings by Douglas Alvord are nothing short of spectacular. Closely observed and carefully rendered, they possess all of the haunting serenity of Jewett\u2019s landscapes.
