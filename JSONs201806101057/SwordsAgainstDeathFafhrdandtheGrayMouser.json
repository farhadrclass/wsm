There are many entertaining individual tales here, my favorite being the two stories about towers (\"The Jewels of the Forest\" and \"The Howling Tower\" and Leiber's affectionate--although not slavish-tribute to the Cthulhu mythos of his mentor Lovecraft in \"The Sunken Land.\""}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "Plagued by the nightmares they saw in Lankhmar in the last book Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser flee the city and gave their word never to come back only to meet a mysterious figure who predicts they will come back - several times. From this point on the plot became very sketchy with a lot of exploits by the dynamic duo just briefly mentioned. Time passes and the friends have to return to the great city as predicted. From this point on their adventures are described in greater details.The first book consisted of four stories dealing mostly with the origins of the pair and circumstances of their meeting, some of which are fairly boring to be honest. In this book the stories are shorter: there are ten of them at practically the same page count. This forms works much better as none of the single stories is boring or bad. For the trivia fans: young Glen Cook had some influence on some stories; looks like it was a good one. The pair stumbles from one adventure into another one driven by treasure hunt in most cases, or just a simple restlessness. Most of the time they end up with just enough part of the treasure to get by (read - spend it in a nearest tavern), or just with their lives. Sword fights and last minute escapes are aplenty. This is a classic sword and sorcery book and this time I do not hesitate to call it such.The final rating is 4 stars. This one is the best out of the first three.

Fighting men predominated and the clank of swordmen's harnesses mingled with the thump of tankards, providing a deep obbligato to the shrill laughter of the women. Swaggering guardsmen elbowed the insolent bravos of the young lords. Grinning slaves bearing open wine-jars dodged nimbly between. In one corner a slave girl was dancing, the jingle of her silver anklet bells inaudible in the din. Outside the small, tight-shuttered windows a dry. whistling wind from the south filled the air with dust that eddied between the cobblestones and hazed the stars. But here all was jovial confusion.The Gray Mouser was one of a dozen at the gaming table. He was dressed all in gray-jerkin, silken shirt, and mouseskin cap-but his dark, flashing eyes and cryptic smile made him seen more alive than any of the others, save for the huge copper-haired barbarian next to him, who laughed immoderately and drank tankards of the sour wine of Lankhmar as if it were beer.\"They say you're a skilled swordsman and have come close to death many times,\" continued the small pale man in the black robe, his thin lips barely parting as he spoke the words.But the Mouser had made his throw, and the odd dice of Lankhmar had stopped with the matching symbols of the eel and serpent uppermost, and he was raking in triangular golden coins. The barbarian answered for him.\"Yes, the gray one handles a sword daintily enough-almost as well as myself. He's also a great cheat at dice.\"\"Are you, then, Fafhrd?\" asked the other. \"And do you, too, truly think a man can cheat death, be he ever so cunning a cheat at dice?\"The barbarian showed his white teeth in a grin and peered puzzledly at the small, pale man whose somber appearance and manner contrasted so strangely with the revelers thronging the low-ceilinged tavern fumy with wine.\"You guess right again.\" he said with a bantering tone. \"I am Fafhrd, a Northerner, ready to pit my wits against any doom.\" He nudged his companion. \"Look, Mouser, what do you think of this little black-coated mouse who's sneaked in through a crack in the floor and wants to talk with you and me about death?\"The man in black did not seem to notice the jesting insult. Again his bloodless lips hardly moved, yet his words were unaffected by the surrounding clamor, and impinged on the ears of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser with peculiar clarity. \"It is said you two came close to death in the Forbidden City of the Black Idols, and in the stone trap of Angarngi, and on the misty island in the Sea of Monsters. It is also said that you have walked with doom on the Cold Waste and through the Mazes of Klesh. But who may be sure of these things, and whether death and doom were truly near? Who knows but what you are both braggarts who have boasted once too often? Now I have heard tell that death sometimes calls to a man in a voice only he can hear. Then he must rise and leave his friends and go to whatever place death shall bid him, and there meet his doom. Has death ever called to you in such a fashion?\"Fafhrd might have laughed, but did not. The Mouser had a witty rejoinder on the tip of his tongue, but instead he heard himself saying: \"In what words might death call?\"\"That would depend,\" said the small man. \"He might look at two such as you and say the Bleak Shore. Nothing more than that. The Bleak Shore. And when he said it three times you would have to go.\"This time Fafhrd tried to laugh, but the laugh never came. Both of them could only meet the gaze of the small man with the white, bulging forehead, stare stupidly into his cold, cavernous eyes. Around them the tavern roared with mirth at some jest. A drunken guardsmen was bellowing a song. The gamblers called impatiently to the Mouser to stake his next wager. A giggling woman in red and gold stumbled past the small, pale man, almost brushing away the black cowl that covered his pate. But he did not move. And Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser continued to stare-fascinatedly, helplessly-into his chill, black eyes, which now seemed to them twin tunnels leading into a far and evil distance. Something deeper than fear gripped them in iron paralysis. The tavern became faint and soundless, as if viewed through many thicknesses of glass. They saw only the eyes and what lay beyond the eyes, something desolate, dreary, and deadly. \"The Bleak Shore,\" he repeated.4 1/4 stars"}, {"userName": "Gary ", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27528763-gary", "userReview": "I did enjoy the classic fantasy element of this book. Understanding where a genre began and understanding the influences is important to me. That is why I chose this series. I found my mind wandering at times and needed to reread sections. Quite often, really. I commented on this to my 13 year old daughter (who is a sometimes voracious reader) and she promptly informed me that her mind wanders when a book bores her and she quits it.Maybe she was right. Maybe this book did bore me. It shouldn't have. It had all the elements of an interesting plot, developed characters, bizarre villains. But my mind did wander and it was a struggle. Hence three stars rather than four.Maybe I need a break from this. I need to read something immersive for the sake of reading rather than trying to understand a genre. Maybe I am just over complicating this and this book bores me a little."}, {"userName": "J.G.

I enjoy a good pulp now and again, but this nearly reached the mirth and derring-do of Dumas' Musketeers. Many of these stories were written before those of the first collection. They were short magazine submissions, and it was only later that Leiber thought to write introductory stories.Being written in the early part of Leiber's career at different times and places, the stories show a great deal of pleasing variance. Each short tale presents its own setting, its own locations, and its own feel. They are all loosely connected into a grander arc, and the reader is invited to draw connections and conclusions about the interstitial parts, evoking real historical accounts.It's not difficult to see how, writing these stories without a clear path, at many times throughout his life, we get a grander scope of his world, from vibrant, rough stories to more complex, idea-driven ones. This somewhat piecemeal approach is engaging and unpredictable, especially in comparison to Leiber's later work on the series, which is unfortunately repetitive and narrow in scope.There are a few sections which grow a bit silly and stilted, but it is altogether quick and enjoyable, with the vivacity, wit, and creativity to keep the reader occasionally surprised and often amused.My Fantasy Book Suggestions"}, {"userName": "Joseph", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5004971-joseph", "userReview": "More escapades with Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, a surprising number of which still take place far from Lankhmar, the City of Sevenscore Thousand Smokes. Now that the origin stories have been dispensed with (in the previous volume), we can finally see Fafhrd and Mouser as the (mostly) inseparable comrades we've been expecting. Chronologically speaking, the stories are a mixed bag -- most date from the 1940's (including \"Jewels in the House\", a.k.a. \"Two Sought Adventure\", their first published outing) and a couple date from the early 1970's (\"The Circle Curse\" and \"The Price of Pain-ease\", both of which tie off narrative threads from the previous volume's \"Ill-met in Lankhmar\").There are some fine, fine stories in here. If forced at the point of Scalpel or Graywand (Mouser always calls whatever sword he's currently using Scalpel, and Fafhrd recycles the name Graywand) to pick just one I'd be tempted by \"Bazaar of the Bizarre\", the story of a peculiar shop selling most intriguing wares. But really, you can't go wrong with any of them.Again, one of the great joys is Leiber's elegant, sardonic prose. I almost feel like I can follow a through-line from James Branch Cabell to Leiber to Terry Pratchett. Or have I had one too many jugs from the Silver Eel?"}, {"userName": "\u0414\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL":

The pair were chronicled over ~5 decades by the man who termed the genre \u201cSword & Sorcery\u201d (Fritz Leiber) in separate short stories (covering ~40 stories, published over 1939 to 1991). Their adventures in the City of Lankhmar and World of Nehwon were captured in seven books. Scooby Doo Where Are You? was a Hanna-Barbera production, broadcast from 1969 to 1978 (notably the same time many of Leiber\u2019s work was compiled into novels.) Scooby Doo (and its reboots) were known for juxtaposing scary atmospheres with acceptable silliness\u2026in episodic form. This is exactly what Swords against Death delivers, and presumably represents the other Fafred and Mouser novels. A possible exception is the chapter \u201cIll met in Lankhmar\u201d (the last story in Vol-1 \u201cSwords and Deviltry\u201d in which the scary-silly style is presented, but the outcome more dire than anything in this second volume.)Fafhrd and the Mouser float from one independent adventure to the next. Each chapter is an enjoyable episode, but there is an apparent lack of an overarching conflict for the duo. Ostensibly the chapters are linear in chronology, but they really seemed stand alone and could be read in any order. From the opening (and the end of the first Volume Swords and Deviltry) I expected the pair to be haunted by their past loves, but these haunts were only addressed in only one chapter later. Varied perspectives and controlled revelations keep each narrative fresh. The stories are indeed fortified with literate prose and abundant vocabulary, but just when you think Leiber may take his milieu too seriously, you will be treated to a ludicrous robbery by fishing pole, a grand displacement/theft of a house, an assault from giant snowballs, or a hunt from bad guys skiing in an apparent satire to a Bond film. But, the silliness does not detract from enjoyable adventure. Just like the original Scooby Doo cartoon. Emotive Oil Painting: Oil paintings will forever inspire emotion of fantasy media. For Scooby Doo, background stylist Walt Peregoy created some truly scary paintings worthy as any cover art. During the same years, Jeff Jones illustrated the first five of the ~1970's editions for Fritz Leiber (Michael Whelan did the sixth). Check out the series:1970; 1970; 1968; 1968; 1968;1977; 1988"}, {"userName": "Bogdan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2537876-bogdan", "userReview": "I love everything about this series of books! This second volume has more stories and the action goes from land to sea, from house to tower, from the hot lands to the icelands, and introduces a lot of new creatures and some, new players in to the story.The writing remained in the same style and I was impressed by the true friendship that develops, along this volume, between the two unusual heroes.There are some dramatic moments along some of the stories and the stakes are highier than ever.In this one the writer had more time to expand the personalities of the two characters and to engage them in a lot of fresh adventures.If you have enjoyed the first one, then this is a must!"}, {"userName": "Kat  Hooper", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177891-kat-hooper", "userReview": "ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature.Ho, Fafhrd tall!

For the past three years, the two have grown so close that they are now (as Neil Gaiman suggests in his introduction to the audio version) like two halves of the same person. They\u2019ve been traveling the world together in an effort to forget their lost loves.During their travels \u201cthey acquired new scars and skills, comprehensions and compassions, cynicisms and secrecies \u2014 a laughter that lightly mocked, and a cool poise that tightly crusted all inner miseries,\u201d but they haven\u2019t been able to assuage their guilt or lessen their feelings of loss outside of Lankhmar, the city which they swore never to return to.But as Sheelba of the Eyeless Face prophesied (\u201cNever and forever are neither for men.

It was produced by Audible Frontiers, introduced by Neil Gaiman, and read by Jonathan Davis who does a terrific job with this series. His voices for Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are perfect \u2014 Fafhrd sounds pensive, intellectual, and introverted while Gray Mouser sounds a bit greasy and common. I highly recommend this format; it adds an extra dimension to these fun stories.More Leiber reviews at FanLit."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "4.0 to 4.5 stars.

Again Fritz Leiber took a group of independent stories written in the early 1940s and added connective and framing material to make the book more cohesive. As a result, I think some the best stories are the earliest ones, written for the pulp magazines like Unknown, though the final story is also excellent.There are ten stories altogether in Swords and Deviltry, though seven of them first appeared in a collection called Two Sought Adventure published in 1957. All of the stories are filled with the rough-and-tumble adventures of Fahrd and the Gray Mouser, two rogues, swordsmen, con-men, and treasure-hunting adventurers. Having suffered tragedy at the end of the previous novel, they continue to mourn this loss and initially vow to never return to the teeming city of Lankhmar, but in the initial story \u201cThe Circle Curse\u201d, they discover that even after three years of restless questing they have still not assuaged their pain, and decide this path is fruitless.All the stories in this collection are written with swift, deft touches of humor, amazing descriptive passages, and exciting but tightly-written action sequences. The quality of writing is vastly superior to later books in the genre that merely try to recreate the flair of these originals. Among them, I found the following four stories to be standouts:In \u201cThe Jewels in the Forest\u201d (1939) the two adventurers are lured by obscure references written in the margins of a book that point to a mysterious treasure located in a tower in a forest. They journey in search of this, also making a stop at a peasant\u2019s house to entertain for their food (which recalls but contrasts sharply with a similar stop-over by the Hound and Arya in Game of Thrones Season 3). When they arrive at the tower, they discover it to be a tomb built by a madman to lure treasure-seekers, but seemingly undefended. This soon turns out to be wrong, and the duo has to battle a terrifying monster to escape.In \u201cThieves House\u201d (1943), our two heroes steal a jeweled skull but are then double-crossed by the Thieves Guild member who hired them for the job. Despite their earlier vow to never return, they find themselves again trying to infiltrate the Thieves House in order to exact revenge. They find themselves again entangled with their hated rival Kroval, the head of the guild, but even the Theives\u2019 Guild itself has not bargained with the eldritch powers protecting the jeweled skull, and it falls on Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser to put things to rights or face the wrath of the undead. The whole Thieves\u2019 Guild concept has certainly influenced Dungeons & Dragons, not to mention the long-running shared-world Thieves\u2019 World anthologies edited by Robert Aspirin and Lynn Abbey. In \u201cThe Price of Pain-Ease\u201d (1970), Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are still mourning the loss of their lovers, and settle down in their former lover\u2019s abodes and get a bit maudlin and indolent. So they consult with Ningauble of the Seven Eyes and Sheelba of the Eyeless Face, who essentially cut a deal with them that if they pledge their service then these wizards will grant them a reunion with their lost loves now dwelling in the Shadow Lands. So they are tasked with the impossible mission of stealing Death\u2019s Mask. It\u2019s a great concept, and the idea of Death becoming a character has also been humorously explored in Terry Pratchett\u2019s Mort, and in very different fashion in Piers Anthony\u2019s On a Pale Horse. My only complaint is that the story ends fairly abruptly, and I wanted more involvement from Death (how often can you say that?).The final story, \u201cThe Bazaar of the Bizarre\u201d (1963), is suitably strange and fantastic. Our two rogues are summoned by their patron wizards to infiltrate a strange shop peddling curios in The Plaza of Dark Delights. The Gray Mouser shows up early and is enchanted by the various goods that he perceives to be the objects of his greatest desire, including a series of golden cages with beautiful maidens hanging from the ceiling. Fafhrd, on the other hand, is given a spider web blindfold of true-seeing and cloak of invisibility by his patron, and thus sees through the illusion to discover the bazaar is selling worthless trash and the situation is far more sinister than at first glance. He must do battle with various formidable foes to win free and save the Mouser, who is blissfully unaware of any danger and hilariously interferes with Fafhrd\u2019s desperate swordfights with skeleton warriors. This story really reminded me in tone of the opening of Jack Vance\u2019s The Eyes of the Overworld, in which Cugel the Clever enters the tent of a curio seller, and first learns of the treasures held by Ioucounu the Laughing Magician, since he too cannot resist the allure of magic talismans just like the Mouser. The only difference is that Cugel does not have a faithful companion like Fafhrd the Barbarian to bail him out, but I\u2019m quite certain they share a kindred spirit.Overall, this collection of stories is an excellent introduction to the FAFHRD AND THE GRAY MOUSER series, more so than the previous book Swords and Deviltry (with the exception of the initial meeting story \u201cIll Met in Lankhmar\u201d). If any of it seems to ring familiar to other sword and sorcery adventures you have read, that is merely the greatest form of flattery to the legacy of Leiber\u2019s archetypal adventurers."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian", "userReview": "This book is fantastic. Really, I could stop there, along with an exhortation to go read it immediately, but that's hardly an actual review, so I'll continue.As I mentioned in my review for Swords and Deviltry, the first half of that book before Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser met was pretty boring, but the second half was much more engaging. In this book, the two companions start together and stay together for the entirety (or nearly so) of the book, neatly avoiding the long build-up time before the action really gets going.The plots of the short stories are pretty standard sword and sorcery fare, usually driven by the greed of the protagonists or by the meddling of some sort of external sorcerous agency, but the plot isn't the most obvious reason to read this. I think the main thing that makes it stand out for me is the sense of humor. I've read plenty of the Conan stories, and while he occasionally finds reason to laugh, far more common is for the gigantic melancholies to be emphasized over the gigantic mirths. Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser aren't like that in the least. They're constantly joking with each other, commenting sarcastically on the situations they find themselves in, and otherwise seem to take themselves rather less than seriously. As a tabletop roleplayer, I can definitely see where the inspiration for Dungeons and Dragons came from in Leiber's books--take any generic pen and paper RPG session and the characters will have a greater-than-average chance to be acting like one of the pair.The thing that really sets the book apart, though, is the description. As I said previously, Leiber was a devotee of H.P. Lovecraft, and while it shows, he manages to walk edge of the cliff of description without falling into the abyss of purple prose. For example: \"For we did not like the strangely rounded basalt crags of the Bleak Shore; we did not like it that we saw no gulls or hawks or birds of any kind in the leaden air, no seaweed on the beach. And we all three began to catch glimpses of something shimmering at the summit of the cliffs.\"If you replaced \"strangely\" with \"curiously\" there, it could be something that came straight out of a Lovecraft story, though Lovecraft would have made it twice as long and used \"cyclopean\" or \"rugose\" a few times for good measure.The best example comes from the best story in the collection, The Bazaar of the Bizarre:In the Plaza of Dark Delights, which lies seven blocks south of the Marsh Gate and extends from the Fountain of Dark Abundance to the Shrine of the Black Virgin, the shop-lights glinted upward no more brightly than the stars glinted down. For there the vendors of drugs and the peddlers of curiosa and the hawkers of assignations light their stalls and crouching places with foxfire, glowworms, and fire-pots with tiny single windows, and they conduct their business almost as silently as the stars conduct theirs.That is amazingly evocative. I read that and I immediately get an image in my head of what it looks like, and it makes me want to read more. The Grey Mouser's invocation of auspicious days in reference to Lankhmar's animal-themed calendar functions the same way, in that it makes me want to learn more about Lankhmar and its society, and as I've said before, I love worldbuilding and everything to do with it.That's really what it comes down to. Much of fantasy is focused on the plot, the fight against the dark lord, or the lone hero finding his (and it's almost always a he) destiny, but the stories in Swords Against Death are just the stories about what happened in Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser during their lives. All of these stories build images in my head and make me want to know more about Nehwon, and that's really the best thing I can ask for in a book. I cannot recommend this highly enough.Previous Review: Swords and Deviltry.Next Review: Swords in the Mist."}, {"userName": "Benjamin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30940-benjamin", "userReview": "Fritz Leiber's continuing fantasy stories about the adventures of two lovable rogues, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.My thoughts on this are somewhat disorganized, so you get a list:1. It annoys me that these stories in this series are arranged in internal chronological order; so, for instance, in the first book, Swords and Deviltry, we get \"Ill-Met in Lankhmar,\" the 1970 story that tells how Fafhrd, the northern barbarian, and the Gray Mouser, the urban rogue, joined up for their adventures; and in this book, we get several stories of their adventures that were written long before 1970. So it's easy to see how these stories fit together now, but it doesn't give you a fair sense of Leiber's growing writing power and his potential changes in characterization.2. It amuses me that Neil Gaiman's introduction praises Leiber for his ironic tone when Ursula K. Le Guin sadly castigates him for his uneven tone in her wonderful essay, \"From Elfland to Poughkeepsie.\" They're both right about that tone: the irony here comes through a lot of seesawing in tone, both on the sentence level and on the plot level, where Fafhrd and Gray Mouser only take themselves a little seriously: for instance, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are heartbroken over their lost loves, but occasionally find other women.3. Leiber was too young to really be friends with Lovecraft and Howard; and whereas depressive Lovecraft and suicidal Howard (especially in the Conan stories) really want you to understand the nihilism of human experience, I can't quite get a read on Leiber's nihilism here and what he actually means by it. There is a lot that seems Howardian nihilism: people die easily in these stories; very little is actually accomplished. (The typical Fafhrd and Gray Mouser story is 1st) find a huge treasure, 2nd) lose a huge treasure, 3rd) get drunk before the next adventure); and there are occasional glimpses of cosmic emptiness. But sometimes that nihilism almost seems like a lark, like an enjoyable put-on job. In some ways, my less-generous self wants to compare Leiber's take on Howard as the later cyberpunks take on Gibson: who cares about the serious ideas here, let's wear leather and chrome!4. That said, Leiber at his best--which is probably \"Ill-Met in Lankhmar\"--takes the sword and sorcery style and gets some fun tricks out of it: for instance, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser run across a standard-seeming ghost story (reminiscent of Wharton's \"Kerfol\" in its use of ghost dogs), and though there isn't much story there, the insane monologue from the haunted man at the center of this story is a knockout of condensed dread; and \"The Bazaar of the Bizarre\" seems like a fantasy indictment of American's consumerism, like Simak's They Walked Like Men (where aliens take over the Earth by selling us useless things and buying it up).5. And while Leiber occasionally pays homage to the cosmic loneliness of his forebears (Howard, C. L. Moore), he's at his best in the personal stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and the way he plays with the archetypes even as he's building them. For instance, Fafhrd is a barbarian, like Conan; but Fafhrd is also trained as a singer and scholar in some ways. Mouser is the urbane sophisticate, but he's also the superstitious rube. And though one adventure stretches into the Shadowlands of death, it begins with Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser steal a garden house while drunk so that they finally have a place to live.6. Also, even though these stories are arranged suboptimally for my purposes, and I suspect are somewhat edited, there are some hilarious notes to cover up inconsistencies in the text. For instance, Fafhrd's sword is described differently in different stories; and we later learn that's because he constantly breaks and loses his sword and has to steal a new one, which he gives the same name to. It's funny to me because it undercuts the self-important mythologizing so common to fantasy."}, {"userName": "Joel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8809317-joel", "userReview": "I won't lie - it was all I could do to even finish this book. I appreciate what it was and what it accomplished - the series is credited as one of the pioneers of sword and sorcery fantasy, and built the archetype for the 2-man duo in the genre, paving the way for things like Riyria and Egil and Nix. Unfortunately, it just does it so, so boringly. The writing is of good quality, the story is fine, but there's just nothing exciting for me. I felt nothing for any of the characters, I never felt they were in any peril as they seemed to magically find a way out of every trap and situation. Even in books where I know that's the case, there's some drama - in these books, I felt none.I think I'm done with 'classic' fantasy - even the stuff that is good is just not as good as the majority of modern works.

Particularly interesting were stories IV, V, and VI respectively 'The Bleak Shore', 'The Howling Tower', and 'The Sunken Land' that have certain bizzare Lovecraftian elements and less humor and more gravity and are more horror-based. These qualities can be sensed in all the ten stories but feels more prominent in the three that I mentioned, specially strong and similar milieu to 'Call of Cthulhu' has been created in 'The Sunken Land' in which a thunder-bound mad viking ship crosses strange seas and finds the forgotten land and is devoured by doom. Another interesting element is the city of Lankhmar, for me as someone who has always been in love with Tolkien's books and that particular world, reading new Fantastical books and discovering the width and variety and complexity that can be created is a joy. Nehwon is thoroughly interesting, though not as minutely detailed and organized (at least not in the first two books). Fafhrd and Mouser's adventures take them to several places however; The Cold waste does sound a bit like 'Beyond the Wall' and 'Lands of Forever Winter' (or is it the other way around?) And the outer seas may not be a prominent setting, the hills they trod and the seas they cross are by far not as gripping nor important as Lankhmar, the city feels at once alien and exotic, with the Thieves' Guild (which I love From Skyrim and I see now where they get it) and The Great Salt Marsh, the night smog and passing in-story descriptions of gothic architecture and strange custom of which I would love to read and know more."}, {"userName": "Commodore Tiberius Q.

Fritz Leiber was, simply, a terrific, extremely talented writer with a true love of language and a prodigious, playful, incredibly unique style.

There is a miasma of The Weird in all of the Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories, whether in the outr\u00e9 settings or unconventional magic or the hints of otherworldly visitation."}, {"userName": "Jean-marcel", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8821840-jean-marcel", "userReview": "Reading this set of tales for the second time through, it occurred to me that most of them are actually ghost stories told in a fantastic milieu. This doesn't really surprise me, as Leiber successfully told many ghost stories in a modern/contemporary setting, especially (but not only) in urban settings, and so as this particular genre is clearly close to his heart, it makes sense that he would be able to transmute a ghost tale with some of the traditional trappings into a sword and sorcery yarn. And for the most part, it works really, really well here. This particular compilation may lack some of the fun of later Fafhrd and Gray Mouser escapades, but there's still humour and zeal in abundance, and a lot of grimness, and huge heapings of atmosphere.I've said this before in other reviews, but it's really hit me re-reading these first two books in leiber's sword and sorcery series that nobody can describe states of bewitchment, curses, and geases quite like he could. it's like he has some firsthand experience of what it must be like to be placed under a spell or compulsion. Reading this stuff sometimes feels like shifting into an altered state of consciousness where on some level you know that something is terribly wrong with how you perceive the world, but you carry on anyway, blindly obeying the sorcerous burden placed upon you. It's really something, the way leiber is able to describe this and give you that creepy gooseflesh feeling by means of evocative, sensuous writing.The action scenes are always well thought out, too, and depicted with vigor and enthusiasm. It's not quite the blood and thunder madness of much of Robert E. Howard's work, but it's more \"swashbuckling\", sneaky and wily. Wits ultimately prove to trump swordcraft in importance, though there is a lot of slashing and bashing and cutting, all the same.Here's a little about each story:\"The Circle Curse\"\tThis is a somewhat abstract way in which to begin the book, the tale being less of a conventional story and more of a description of moods and states of mind over the passage of several years. It does describe how Fafhrd and the Mouser meet their wizard patrons, without even realising yet that they have done so, and shows that though they've been making many journeys and heroic undertakings, the deaths of their loved ones haunt them still. Really good as a character piece.\"The Jewels in the forest\"\tThis was written earlier than everything else in the whole Fafhrd and Mouser canon, or at least published first, and you can tell a bit. The twosome don't seem quite as developed as they would be later, when you really get a sense of them as individuals. It doesnt' seem normal that Mouser would be so supersticious, in particular. But it's a weird little story with lots of heavy action scenes and a ghostly twist. i really enjoyed how Leiber described them settling down to a fire, food and drink among a family of peasants, where they all shared stories and songs.\"Thieves' House\"\tA return to the edifice of the Thieves' Guild, those responsible for the deaths of Fafhrd and The Mouser's loves. Not quite the big tale of vengeance one might expect, and that's realistic. This book is all about these kinds of \"big\" concepts of \"revenge\", \"love\", \"justice\" and all that being not quite as significant as many (especially would-be heroes) tend to think they are, so it fits that Fafhrd and Mouser are a bit overshadowed here in their quest by other concerns. Features the first, but not the last, instance of a girl taking the goal from right under our friends' noses. The Mouser dressing up as a creeky old fortune-telling crone is hilarious.\"The Bleak Shore\"\tA terrible curse carries Fafhrd and the mouser far away from Lankhmar and most explored lands. This is extremely atmospheric and creepy, especially the opening scenes.\"The Howling Tower\"\tFar away from home, Fafhrd and Mouser are just trying to make the best of things. Some strange and eerie noises in the night prove to be much more than mere forest animals. More atmosphere so thick you could cut it. I wish we had gotten more of Fafhrd's perspective in this one, but there's more mystery this way. The ultimate revelation of the insane old guy in the tower was awesome and pure horror.\"The Sunken Land\"\tMaking their way slowly back toward Lankhmar on a jerry-rigged sloop, Fafhrd and the Mouser find a mysterious ring inset with an ancient key. We hear that Nehwon, like many other lands of history, has a legend of a great sunken civilisation that fell beneath the waves due to some great calamity or hubris. The twosome run into some crazed pirates looking for the treasure of this mysterious realm. Chaos and death ensue. It's a really good story that could have been a little longer. It's also starting to feel that Fafhrd and the Mouser don't actually have much agency with all these supernatural forces, and that sometimes they're just around to let things happen and escape \"by the skin of their teeth\". That's alright though.\"Seven Black Priests\"\tWhat a cool title, and a really cool story, too. I wanted to find out more about the eponymous Black Priests, though. I love the song about their adventures Fafhrd was singing to keep Mouser entertaine, and how he broke off to slay an onrushing priest and then just continued right where he left off in the bard song. Classic. \"Claws in the Night\"\tThe description of crazy fashion trends in Lankhmar high society is great. The newest trend, women hiding their faces behind big gaudy bird cages, is an adaptation of sorts, because the jewels and finery of all the society ladies of the city are being snatched away by rapacious avians. I like the concept, but felt this was one of the weaker tales. It has an ultimately tragic feeling that isn't quite born out by the tale itself. Essentially the pieces are all good but it doesn't really add up to a great whole.\"The Price of Pain-ease\"\tA short companion piece to \"The Circle Curse\". One might also say that this represents the breaking of the circle. It's another character study of sorts that shows how Fafhrd and Mouser are growing. In a way, it's sad, because this growth entails a kind of mounting cynicism, but you could argue that's a necessary trait for survival in any world for a reasonably stable \"adult\" person. After this, the tragedy of the dead lovers described at the end of the previous volume will have much less of a hold on the two friends. I'd say this marks the end of their adolescence.\"Bazaar of the Bizarre\"\t...and from adolescence, we fall right into the sort of trap that is waiting for \"grownups\" in this messed up world (and I mean ours, of course): rampant consumerism. The Mouser, in particular, is the ideal victim for what amounts to a scam perpetrated by extra-dimensional aliens on the people of Lankhmar. Good thing Fafhrd and Mouser's wizard patrons are going to put aside their differences and set everyone straight ... or are they? This story is terrific.That's it then. Rogues, swords, pirates, ghosts and Entities from Beyond, with dashes of humour and horror, though there's more of the latter in this particular volume than the former. As my girlfriend often says, \"what's not to like?\" I can't recommend these highly enough to people who appreciate this sort of thing, and I feel like many would be delighted if they discovered the joy of reading about these two characters and their escapades.

For a bit it seemed he had some kind of prohibition against killing but that does not present itself in any other story I have read with them.

The stories are far too short--fine, I've never been a big fan of short stories, so I'll try to disregard that. Next, however, are the plots. They are all entirely anticlimactic, which begs the question: are they doing anything else instead of having recognizable narrative melodies? Not that I can tell. There is some dry humor at times, but they're not truly funny. There are some pointed observations regarding characters or events occasionally, but there is no apparent moral or message. There are descriptions of locations or mythos every once in a while, but no great flair for world building. They always center on the same pair of characters, who are nevertheless more static, superficial caricatures than deeply realized people. They recount adventures, but aren't thrilling or gratifyingly fun.They do nothing badly, but nothing well, either."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732181-scott", "userReview": "The further adventures of progressive barbarian Fafhrd and wizardling thief Gray Mouser. I am really enjoying these stories. They are a great escape and are also, unexpectedly, quite funny. My favorites in this collection were the final two, which feature the pair's rival mentors and taskmasters, the verbose Ningauble of the Seven Eyes and the concise and direct Sheelba of the Eyeless Face."}, {"userName": "Brigid", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118875-brigid", "userReview": "The Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories are the wittiest take on pulp sword and sorcery out there. This is one of the best of the collections, barring the first story. It has battles and jewels and lissome dancing girls and sorcerous death in the night, but done with panache and a dash of irony. Even if you don't ordinarily like this sort of thing, you might like these."}, {"userName": "Miguel L\u00f3pez del Pueyo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16721962-miguel-l-pez-del-pueyo", "userReview": "\u00a1M\u00e1s aventuras, m\u00e1s magia, m\u00e1s mazmorreo!"}, {"userName": "Florin Pitea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2880025-florin-pitea", "userReview": "A pleasant read.
