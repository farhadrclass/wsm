The two are quite different in style, but I'm so glad I decided to give this a shot because I think I can safely say that it's now a new favorite. While the \"revivers\" are technically zombies, I love how it doesn't go in more of a traditional route with them. Instead it's a very tight mystery with paranormal horror elements, but it's definitely noir at its core. It's great trying to put things together with the unique cast. By the way, this story features some fantastic character development, and brilliant artwork. I can't wait to continue on with this graphic novel series! I really hope the plans for the adaptation go through because this has so much potential as a film (or tv series) - I wouldn't say no to Naveen Andrews taking on the part of Ibrahaim Ramin!"}, {"userName": "GrilledCheeseSamurai", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2729981-grilledcheesesamurai", "userReview": "Soooo it's a zombie story...but without the zombies.Or something?Okay - it's not a zombie story. It's about dead people coming back to life in a small Wisconsin town. Don't make the same mistake that I did writing this series off because it's just another zombie story. I mean really...how many more of those do we need?No...this isn't that simple. This is rural/noir/horror at its finest. This is about fucked up people trying to come to grips with a fucked up situation. This is about heavy character development and some damn fine supernatural mystery. There's a lot of 'what the hell' moments that leave you scratching your head only to slap yourself in the forehead when things all come together and shock the shit out of you.Really...what this is...is candy crystal meth sprinkled on top of cocaine cupcakes. Thank the gods I bought both of the large deluxe editions because I just didn't want to stop reading.At first I was like...meh.Then I was like...meh?And then I was like...OH MY FUCKING SHIT!!and now I'm here.A damn fine comic.

One is the HBO show \" The Leftovers\" and the other is the Kirkman show \"Outcast\". The town of Wausau, Wisconsin is the epicenter of a very strange events. The dead are not staying dead. While they are not returning as zombies the fact that a deceased cancer patient, is happily strolling the hospital wards, greeting people is cause for consternation.So a full blockade of the city, a 'la Leftovers style, is causing Wausau to become a hotbed of strange and bizarre events. In the middle of all this, the story follows of the adventures of the Cypress family- a dysfunctional family of a father and his two annoying daughters. The events take place as seen through their eyes. The father and the one daughter are local police, so it is an informative look at the events. I will not spoil any more of the story- but suffice it to say there are some big questions here. Not to mention the idea of people who can not die is bound to cause multiple issues for the police trying to maintain control. More than this I shall not spoil.The artwork is good and fits the story well. So why 3 stars? Two things- the unexplained nature of the ghost spirit thing, the irritating people of Wausau (especially the annoying Cypress family-all of them) and the utter disbelief in the scenario that dead people are rising from death and the Federal government response is to send 1 CDC doctor and then leave the rest up to the 5 local police officers. Yeah? Really? As if 10,000 Federal Agents/troops/whatever wouldn't descend on Wausau in seconds and boot the local yokels to the curb (where they belong). Still it was an interesting read and has some potential. I will be interested in volume two as there are some huge unanswered questions from this story."}, {"userName": "Yasha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36307634-yasha", "userReview": "It should be 3.5 stars because of the first half of the volume which was quite boring.

Dort lie\u00df ich ihn eingeschlossen zur\u00fcck und \u00f6ffnete die Wohnungst\u00fcr. Freudig mit dem Schwanz wedelnd begr\u00fc\u00dfte mich - - - unser Hund!Hatte die Continuity-Abteilung meines UBW geschlampt oder war der Traum hinterh\u00e4ltig und durch die kalte K\u00fcche von Anfang an als genuiner Albtraum konzipiert gewesen? Einerlei, der Horror beim Anblick des zweiten und doch selben Hundes war unbeschreiblich und noch heute abrufbar.Was das mit REVIVAL zu tun hat? Gar nicht so wenig. Zum einen zeigt es, warum ich immer noch ein Horror-Novize bin; ich kann auf viel Blut und Gewalt gut verzichten und \"grusele\" mich gerne auf die vielleicht herk\u00f6mmlichere Weise, die eher Geistergeschichten zugrunde liegt. Zum anderen aber wirft sich die Frage auf, warum Identit\u00e4t so ein hervorragendes Schauermotiv ist. Ob im Paranoia-Kino der 50er Jahre oder im Doppelg\u00e4ngermotiv in der Literatur, es bereitet uns einmaligen Schrecken, wenn jemand nicht der ist, der er vorgibt zu sein oder der er sein sollte.REVIVAL verlagert das Motiv nun ins waschechte Horrorgenre. In dem kleinen St\u00e4dtchen Wausau, Wisconsin, kehren pl\u00f6tzlich die Toten unter die Lebenden zur\u00fcck. Seeley erz\u00e4hlt die Story aber nicht im Stile einer Zombie-Apocalypse. Unaufgeregt stellt er die Frage, wie mit den Verstorbenen umzugehen ist, die ihren Platz im Leben wieder einnehmen. Polizei, Gesundheitsamt, Presse, Kirche - alle Instituionen laufen auf Hochtouren und k\u00f6nnen doch nichts dazu beitragen, Normalit\u00e4t wieder herzustellen. Dabei verhalten sich die meisten Zur\u00fcckgekehrten (Sleeper) unauff\u00e4llig, nehmen ihre fr\u00fchere Besch\u00e4ftigung wieder auf und treffen sich in Selbsthilfegruppen. Gerade dieser Versuch, Normalit\u00e4t zur\u00fcck zu gewinnen, macht f\u00fcr mich den gr\u00f6\u00dften Horror an REVIVAL aus. Nat\u00fcrlich verzichtet Seeley nicht auf waschechte Horrorszenen, und gelegentlich flie\u00dft (nicht wenig) Blut, T\u00e4ter und Opfer finden sich unter den Sleepern genau wie unter der Bev\u00f6lkerung.Gerade die Mischung aus scheinbarer Normalit\u00e4t und Unerkl\u00e4rlichem macht den Reiz der Handlung f\u00fcr mich aus."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/898236-megan", "userReview": "This story takes the whole \"dead returning to life\" concept, and instead of going the zombie route, turns it into a pretty great supernatural mystery.

The setting of Wausau, Wisconsin makes it even cooler as there are few stories that take place in the state and hardly any that take place outside of Milwaukee or Madison.The dialogue and the stories that have unraveled so far have been really good, but it has been the characters created that are the real draw here. You have the sheriff and his daughter, who is our lead. Her sister with a hidden past, her son stuck in a world that he can't come to grips with, his father who has never been able to come to grips with life, the washed up B move maker, self help book guru, reporter who broke the story, and CDC representative along with a huge cast of others who weave in and out of the story.While I love out main character who reminds me allot of the female lead in season 1 of Fargo, it may be her sister who I am the most interested. There are just too many treads to pull on there for her not to be.There have been some great moments from the first case of Revival, to the grandmother turning bad, to the spirit hunter, to the un-vegitable, to the showdown in the barn, this first collection just kept punching.My favorite thing about it, so far, though, has probably been the open philosophical questions about life and death, what it means to be human, the oft monstrosity of human nature, family, what a soul is and does, and whether or not you should come back if you can.I would be remiss not to at least mention the art of Mike Norton. He depicts some truly horrific things in this collection, which often left me a bit grossed out and/or a little nervous and twitchy. There were a night or two when the images would come back to haunt me when I laid down to sleep.This was an amazing start to this series and it is presented in the best possible way in this over-sized deluxe edition on thick, glossy paper.

Honestamente la Revival a la que se le pone m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n en casi toda la historia es una mujer normal, pero muy fuerte y rebelde que sigue sus propios instintos sin detenerse mucho por valoraciones intelectuales. Y aunque tiene unos cuantos elementos gen\u00e9ricos como muchos personajes que se venden muy bien en el mercado literario, no me pareci\u00f3 un dibujo plano que no inspire empat\u00eda.Aunque no entend\u00ed mucho todos los cambios de escenas y llegu\u00e9 a pensar en su debido momento que era un recurso mediocre para llenar y llenar p\u00e1ginas, tengo la esperanza de que los escritores hayan tenido la intenci\u00f3n de hacerla as\u00ed desde un principio. Pues, si es as\u00ed, es completa su intenci\u00f3n de adentrarnos en la historia y hacernos sentir como a sus personajes en un ambiente totalmente ca\u00f3tico donde nada de lo que est\u00e1 pasando tan dr\u00e1sticamente se puede entender con facilidad.A pesar de lo confuso que result\u00f3 el 90% de la lectura, me deja con ganas de darle la oportunidad al segundo tomo de la historia.Por cierto: es agradable encontrarse con historias viscerales en las que el sexo es el primer recurso barato al que los escritores recurren y que suele quemarse escena tras escena por no tener la creatividad para llenar m\u00e1s p\u00e1ginas con contenido digno."}, {"userName": "Xhale", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50014287-xhale", "userReview": "Wanted to like this more but there are just too many things wrong with the pacing. The transitions from scene to scene are too abrupt to allow the reader to be vested in what's going on. And when things do get interesting it gets lost in the plethora of side stories. It should never have taken 9 issues for Dana to address seeking out her sister's killer again. Also, this book was pegged as being a mystery but I didn't get that much from reading it because there wasn't enough exploration of anyone's death. And had the later issues shown the actual murders like in the first issue, it would have gone a long way in sustaining the graphic tone. There's too much dialogue that does nothing to propel the story forward or garner interest in some of the secondary characters. Sheriff Cypress, to me, is the most consistent in his arc. I also love Em, but I feel the story should be centered around her and Dana more. The last few issues really got the ball rolling and their complex relationship with their father is a huge part of it. Had certain subplots been introduced sooner it would have made the payoff at the end that much sweeter.Still, there are several flashes of potential and \"OMG\" moments that kept me on the edge just enough to warrant a bit of patience. I hope volume 2 builds off the momentum of the last two issues. A very slow and lengthy set-up but everything SHOULD go downhill from here.
