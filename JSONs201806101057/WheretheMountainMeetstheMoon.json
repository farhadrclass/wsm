{"ratings": 28722, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221050-betsy", "userReview": "When an author wants to write their first fantasy novel for children, they'll sometimes fall back on the books they themselves loved as kids. If they were Alice in Wonderland fans they might go the route of Neil Gaiman's Coraline. If they were partial to The Wizard of Oz they could do as Salman Rushdie did when he wrote Haroun and the Sea of Stories. As Grace Lin explains in her Author's Note to Where the Mountain Meets the Moon, some of the books she read at eleven were dozens upon dozens of Chinese folktale and fairytale stories. With her customary cleverness Lin has now taken the essence of those tales and woven them into a quest novel that is a mix of contemporary smart girl pizzazz and the feel of a classic that your parents were read as children. If there's any author out there today with the potential of being remembered and beloved 100 years down the line, Grace Lin has my vote.Poor in the valley of Fruitless Mountain, young Minli and her family earn their daily rice by working and scraping in the fields near their home. Her sole joy comes at night when her father tells her wonderful stories of far away places. One day Minli buys a goldfish to improve her fortunes, but when her mother sees her \"foolish\" purchase, Minli frees the fish and sets it in the river. Little does she suspect that this single act will give her the impetus to seek her family's fortune by leaving to find the Old Man of the Moon. Along the way Minli makes friends and outwits foes in her attempt to help not just herself but those she loves and cares about.The aforementioned Haroun and the Sea of Stories was the book I kept thinking about when I was reading, Where the Mountain Meets the Moon. As in Lin's novel, Rushdie attempts to reawaken that feeling you get when you read a quest novel where disparate characters band together and become friends along the way. The thing is, Lin has been cleverer than Rushdie here. While his novel was essentially an Oz redux, Lin's world combines old stories and classic myths to come up with something that seems entirely new. The feel of this book has similarities to Oz, in that you feel you are in a safe space when you read this tale. Small children will not be frightened when this is read to them while older kids will relate to Minli and understand what makes her want to run away.In Lin's previous (and younger) novels for kids (The Year of the Dog, The Year of the Rat) she breaks up the text regularly with stories that are pertinent to the action, as well as wonderful little vignettes. While doing so, she impresses you with her writing. Phrases stick in a person's brain, like \"The forest was full of shapes and shadows and only barely could he see the faint footprints on the ground - it was like searching for a wrinkle in a flower petal.\" Lin also conjures up visuals. In one village, each villager cuts a bit of cloth from their own clothes to provide Minli with a warm coat. When she leaves, she waves goodbye. \"As she watched the sea of ruined sleeves flutter at her, she realized it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.\" And she has so perfectly incorporated real legends and fables too. Generally Lin's interpretations of the tales sound like her own inventions. Only once in a while do you get a glimpse of the old tale behind her words. When the Old Man of the Moon changes a man's fate by turning the number 19 into 91 with a simple flick of a brush, one can assume he's not doing it to numbers as we see them, but as a reader you simply do not care.One of the other remarkable things about the book is that the story isn't just Minli's journey we're watching but the emotional journey of her mother. From scraping harpy into loving appreciative person, we see this change come about thanks to her grief. How many quest tales can you think about where you cut between the protagonist and their healthy relatives at home? Even if it happens, the relatives are usually in some kind of dire straits. Not here. The biggest problems dealt with in these passages is the loneliness of the parents. And for some kids, this will be a relief. To know that the parents are still safe and sound. To see how much they care for their absent daughter, even while she's off having adventures. There's a kind of tacit understanding at work here. No matter how far you go, your parents will still be back at your home waiting for you. No matter what.Lin has always been an artist, so it's little surprise that she has illustrated this book. What is new is that the pictures aren't the usual pen and ink spot illustrations. Little Brown shelled out some cold hard cash to make sure that each picture in this book is lush and lovely. While still recognizably her style, the art in this book is not as young as her work on, say, Lissy's Friends or Where on Earth is My Bagel. There's a sophistication here that we've never seen before. For example, the initial view of Fruitless Mountain keeps a finger on what is kid-friendly, but also hints at the history of Chinese art and design at the same time. And in the text there are spot illustrations true, but even these are colorful. My sole regret is how small the book is. Someday it would be nice to see this title in a full lap-sized edition for easier reading. The better to appreciate the pictures, I think.Sometimes it's just nice to read something to your kids that's beautiful. Holding Where the Mountain Meets the Moon is like holding a small treasure. A little piece of art. A graceful departure from the younger books she has done before, Lin mixes great writing with even greater kid-appeal and comes up with a story that everyone can enjoy. Boys and girls, kids and parents, everyone will like what they find here. How many books can you say that of off the top of your head? Ages 7-12."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/343944-emily", "userReview": "My five stars might be misleading. I don't think I would have enjoyed this half as much reading it to myself as I did reading it aloud slowly over many nights with an utterly enchanted seven-year-old hanging on every word. It's a magical quest story woven of Chinese folk tales and the author's own imagination, with bits of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz thrown in as well. There are a few passages that are near quotations, apparently an homage to Baum's classic which I'm guessing was a favorite of Lin's as a child. The illustrations, also by Lin, are exquisite."}, {"userName": "Afkham", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20772420-afkham", "userReview": "\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u062f \u0643\u0647 \u067e\u0627\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0649 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0634 \u0646\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0643\u0647 \u0644\u0630\u062a\u0649 \u0628\u064a\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u062d\u062f\u0649 \u0643\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0642\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0635\u0641 \u0634\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0628\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f"}, {"userName": "Magrat Ajostiernos", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7018524-magrat-ajostiernos", "userReview": "\u00a1Me ha encantado!

It is perfect on so many levels: at the beginning I was reading it with my three-year-old son in mind (he has a crush on the picture of Grace Lin on the back flap), and the text seemed simple enough for him to understand and enjoy the book. But by the end, I was reading for me, having forgotten all about my son, and I was thinking that every mother should read this book. When I buy it (this was a library copy), my son will have to fight me for it.I loved the way that folktales came to life in this book, and the stories throughout (especially the way they connected) and the pictures. The only thing I didn't like was the font that the little stories were in. Oh, and the fact that this book didn't win the Newbery Medal. Seriously, I'm kind of mad about that\u2014not that it's up to me, a lowly nobody in the middle of nowhere, but this book was so beautifully done in word, story, and message that When You Reach Me (which I also enjoyed, but in a different way) seems a bit frivolous beside it now."}, {"userName": "Calista", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16731747-calista", "userReview": "I loved this book. I love learning about myths from the Asian culture. I love how the blurb related this to the Wizard of Oz, and I can see that relationship. MeiLi is on a quest, a journey. Like Dorothy, she realizes she doesn't need anything from an outside source. She has the power within. This is such a lovely tone. The culture is celebrated and the importance of family is here and I love how nature plays into the story so intricately. I enjoy the people she meets along the way and the story with the monkeys made me laugh. That was a great resolve the book did. They characters were unique and distinct. I thought this was well executed.I will be reading more books by Grace Lin. This was fantastic for anyone who loves Mythology."}, {"userName": "The Shayne-Train", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10911019-the-shayne-train", "userReview": "This book was beautifully written. I found it as much a delight to read as my little one did to have it read to her.Minli is a young girl that lives in a poor village in rural China. Under the gloomy shadow of a barren mountain, she and her family toil and drudge to just barely scrape by. She watches as her mother grows more and more discontent with their lot in life, until finally Minli decides to ask the Old Man of the Moon how their fortune can be improved.What follows is a touching, intelligent adventure. I was skeptical of the Wizard of Oz comparison, but it is apt. This book is an instant classic, and I am so glad I got to share it with my daughter.Filled with fleshed-out characters and numerous \"story within a story\" interludes, this book walks that fine knife's edge: teaching moral lessons while never seeming preachy or ham-fisted about it.If you want to bring some joy into your and/or your child's life, come join Minli in her quest to Never-Ending Mountain.

I anticipate that this novel would be to difficult for young readers because of the vocabulary. I suggest \"Where the Mountain Meets the Moon\" for readers fourth grade and older! It's a wonderful story with a great message that wealth and fortune don't give one prosperity and happiness and that the key to happiness is thankfulness. When reading \"Where the Mountain Meets the Moon\" I experienced a range of emotions. I reacted with sadness for Minli's parents who missed their daughter desperately. I laughed when the old man in the village turned the peach Minli gave him into a peach tree for all, but the peaches weren't appearing magically, however every peach taken from the tree one disappeared from the mean vendors stand. Classroom application:This book would be great to read aloud the first few chapters, to get students interested. Then have students independently read the rest of the story.

I loved the adventures of the tailless mouse with his needle/sword braving the dark rat infested underground. Similar to it's YA older brother Redwall, Despereaux will forever be the 'high bar' I compare other children's books to. Where the Mountain Meets the Moon by Grace Lin, I believe, reached my high standards. The fact this book won the Newberry Award means no difference to me. I've read many award winning books and some, in my opinion, didn't deserve them while others did. This book deserved it. There were many good lessons in it for children to be hard working, passionate, forgiving, loving, selfless and thankful. Some of these attributes are not taught in families today, especially forgiveness, selflessness and thankfulness. Minli is a little girl from the Village of Fruitless Mountain who goes in search for fortune. Her family struggles to survive in the desolate land in which they live, and Minli pulls a Mulan in order to honor her family. She meets many interesting people on the way to the Old Man of the Moon, and each person/animal changes her a little for the better. I loved the character growth in this book. I suggest it to every family. There are many aspects of Asian societies I wish were adopted in every culture, especially honor. This story was more enjoyable because I read it to my daughter. She would sit and read along with me and look at the pictures for a very long time. I plan on reading it again when she's older.

Tentunya dengan kecepatan gigi satu ^_ ^ Setiap bab berhenti sekian lama guna menikmati aneka ilustrasi yang disajikan. beberapa baris dibaca ulang, kadang malah menajdi satu halaman dibaca ulang. Saya jadi terobsesi dengan buku ini. Saya menuntut kesempurnaan! Itu makanya saat saya menemukan sebuah hal kecil yang mengganjal, saya langsung merasa kesal. Ok..ok..ok.. teramat sangat KESAL!Hal kecil memang, namun saat menemukannya, kedua alis saya segera bertemu! Buku ini merngambil latar belakang Budaya China. Dalam Bahasa China terdapat keunikan yang khas. Kita tidak akan menemukan huruf A, B, C dan seterusnya. Setiap huruf yang ada memiliki bunyi dan arti yang berbeda. Beberapa huruf memiliki aturan tersendiri. Misalnya huruf D dibaca T, lalu huruf T dibaca The. Huruf B dibaca P, sementara huruf P dibaca PH. Masih tak mengerti kenapa kesempurnaan saya ternodai?Baiklah saya perjelas. Dalam buku ini, terdapat panggilan untuk ayah dan ibu. Kata ibu, disana biasa disebut Mama (\u5988\u5988) tentunya tetap ditulis dan dibaca Mama. Sementara untuk ayah atau bapak biasa disebut papa ( \u7238\u7238) dibaca Papa dari tulisan Baba! Jadi bayangkan bagaimana terganggunya saya saat membaca tulisan Ma dan Ba, waduh..............!Seluruh isi buku ini menyebutkan kedua orang tua Minli dengan Ma dan Ba. Kenapa tidak dengan Ma dan Pa? Berapa banyak orang Indonesia yang memahami Bahasa Mandarin, sehingga bisa mengerti bahwa Ba yang dimakasud dalam buku ini adalah Pa untuk Papa. Tentunya mereka yang tidak mengerti akan mengerutkan alis di awal cerita. Nah, mengerti khan kenapa kesempurnaan saya terasa ternodai ^_^Tapi dari sisi kisah yang disajikan jangan ditanya! Buku ini mengajarkan banyak hal! Ceritanya sebenarnya sangat sederhana, mengingat buku ini ditujukan untuk remaja usia 8-12 tahun. Ceritanya tentang semangat mengubah nasib seorang gadis kecil bernama Minli. Tapi pesan yang ingin disampaikan teramat menyentuh.Keluarga Minli tidak hanya miskin, namun miskin sekali sehingga memelihara seekor ikan sudah merupakan beban. Mereka tinggal di kaki Gunung Nirbuah. Disebur Gunung Nirbuah karena tidak ada hewan atau tumbuhan yang hidup disana. Setiap hari kedua orang tuanya bekerja keras, demikian juga penduduk desa yang lain. Namun orang tua Minli tetap tidak memiliki apa-apa. Mereka tak memiliki benda berharga, kecuali dua buah uang tembaga yang diterima Minli saat ia lahir. Minli bertekat mengubah peruntungan keluarganya.Minli sangat menyukai dongeng yang diceritakan ayahnya. Itu juga yang membuatnya tidak kelihatan coklat dan suram seperti warga desa yang lain. Setiap kali sang ayah bercerita, mata hitamnya bersinar-sinar bagaikan titik-titik air hujan yang terpapar sinar matahari.. Salah satu cerita yang sangat disukainya adalah tentang Kakek Rembulan yang serba tahu.Minli sangat ingin menemui kakek rembulan dan memintanya mengubah peruntungan keluarganya. Minli nekat meninggalkan rumahnya seorang diri. Berbekal seadanya dan koin tembaga terakhir yang dimilikinya, Minli mulai menempuh perjalanan panjang, yang sudah pasti bukan perjalanan biasa. Ia banyak menemukan rintangan dan hambatan, namun Minli juga menemukan banyak sahabat baru.Secara tak langsung, buku ini membawa budaya dan pemikiran ala China dalam diri kita. Kita diberi tahu kenapa Bangsa China sangat menyukai memelihara Ikan Mas, terutama terkait dengan Feng Shui. Bagaimana takdir tidak bisa dihindari, namun kita perlu berusaha mengubahnya.

Everything was really interesting to learn and know, but I felt like something was missing that I can't quite put my finger on. I liked the hero's journey in this one and the way the story came to a conclusion, but I feel like there were other stories in between I would have liked to hear and some that I wanted a more satisfying conclusion to.I really liked Minli and thought she was a great heroine. She was curious and awestruck by everything and didn't let the impossible stop her from chasing her dream. I liked how she grew throughout the story because of what she learned and the people she met. I think her story is the most important and the most interesting.I would recommend this one if you're looking for a quick read that is enjoyable and teaches you about other cultures. I liked getting a view behind the veil sort of deal out of this one and am definitely glad I checked it out. This is my last #12DaysOfDiversity and 2016 read (since I doubt I can do 300+ pages in 20 minutes) and I feel like I ended on a really good note."}, {"userName": "Elisabeth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7522596-elisabeth", "userReview": "I really liked the way this book was set up. The story within a story type style made everything more interesting for me. Also, I like how in the end they all tied together making a moral for the story. I loved the character Minli, which is strange because I usually don't like female children characters in books. But Minli showed strong courage and wasn't some stupid little girl that always got herself into trouble. I found myself excited to finish this book to find out what happens. It wasn't as predictable as most other children's books where we didn't know exactly how new fortune would come to Minli and her family. I would definitely read this book to a future classroom. For the younger kids it seems like a good book to read a couple of chapters out of per day. There are a lot of life lessons that can be taught and I think it is important to learn these at a young age. Overall, I really enjoyed this heartwarming journey between friends and family and would absolutely recommend it."}, {"userName": "Abby Johnson", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson", "userReview": "Inspired by folktales of China, this is the story of a young Chinese girl named Minli. She lives in a poor village underneath a stark mountain and every day her mother expresses her discontent. So Minli sets out to find the Old Man of the Moon to ask him how to change their fortune. What follows is the story of her journey. Along the way she meets many different characters and hears many different stories. The book reads like a fable, which is fitting because it contains so many stories. The ending is just perfect. This will be a delight to any child who enjoys fairy tales and folk tales. Highly recommended.

When my youngest sister was 9 she received this book for Christmas. Upon finishing the book she loved it so much that she promptly flipped the book back over and read it again a second time. Only after her second read did she let me borrow it. Young Minli leaves the Valley of the Fruitless Mountain to seek her fortune for her family, and to save them from the drudgery of laboring endlessly everyday for just a few grains of rice. On the way she befriends a dragon who was born from the ink of a Chinese brush painting. On their quest to find the old man of the moon they interact with traditional Chinese characters and discover the things that are really important. This book is as much about storytelling as anything else, and is a great introductory exposure to Chinese folklore and mythology. It's a story of courage, family, and love, and, as it's middle grade, a quick read.

I had a hard time putting it down, and was completely absorbed in this simple, but brilliant weaving of Chinese folk-lore and fairy tale. I hope one day to be able to read it aloud with my daughter. The wisdom and cleverness reminded me a little of Oscar Wilde\u2019s stories for children.

She encounters a dragon and several people, who she helps and who help her get closer to her goal.

I, too, was expecting to love it, as I love mythology from all over the world and found the idea of an adventurous young girl embarking on a journey with a dragon to better her family fortune captivating. Sadly, while the book contains strong messages and weaves together several traditional stories of Chinese folklore, the writing itself is sadly bland, and the story lags terribly in the middle.\"Where the Mountain Meets the Moon\" follows a young girl named Minli, who lives with her family in an extremely poor village in the valley of Fruitless Mountain. Minli and her parents work hard all day just to have enough to eat, but Minli is happy, for she has her father's stories about dragons and the Man in the Moon to comfort her. But all the same, she sees that her family's poverty is making her parents miserable, and so she sets off on a journey to find the Man in the Moon and ask him to change the family's fortunes. With a flightless dragon for company, she travels toward the Endless Mountain on a journey that will have her befriending kings and orphans, talking to fish and rabbits, confronting fearsome tigers and monkeys, and ultimately making a decision that will change her life forever...My favorite aspect of this book was seeing real Chinese mythology woven into Minli's story, mostly in the form of her father's tales or stories related by people she meets along the way. I don't claim to be an expert on Chinese myth, but I've read some of the stories and was able to recognize several. I'm curious as to which of the stories in this book are actual folktales and which are inventions of the author, and it makes me want to learn more about the folklore and mythology of China. Which, I suppose, means this book has done its job. And the book has a good message at its heart -- that kindness will go a much longer way toward changing one's fortune than power or greed or scheming.Also, the book is peppered with beautiful color illustrations, all of which are done in traditional Chinese styles. These livened up the book considerably, and made for an enchanting reading experience.Sadly, the story itself lags, especially toward the middle. Grace Lin's writing can be lovely at times but is oddly inconsistent -- sometimes it was enchanting and other times it was quite clunky and bland. The story itself seems to wander, and lingers at odd points for longer than necessary. And at times it felt that the various folktales woven into the story didn't mesh well, and could have been incorporated into the story better.It doesn't help that the characters themselves are fairly flat. Minli, despite being the main character, doesn't have much personality beyond being the usual \"adorable precocious child\" so ubiquitous in literature. Dragon is relegated to a personality-free sidekick, and the villain of the story is simply evil for evil's sake. Only Minli's mother sees any character development, and even then it's simply transforming from a nagging harpy to an agreeable wife... which has its own unfortunate implications. I understand that folktales weren't always renowned for their exemplary character development, but a novel adaptation of said folktales should do better, in my mind...This certainly wasn't a terrible book, and can serve as a nice introduction to the unique and colorful world of Chinese mythology for young readers. I simply found it lacking in certain areas, and think it could have been improved on. Still, it's a fine read for younger readers, and the illustrations are a beautiful touch."}, {"userName": "Laura (bbliophile)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36416437-laura-bbliophile", "userReview": "I'm really happy I finally got to this one, it was wonderful."}], "description": "In the valley of Fruitless Mountain, a young girl named Minli spends her days working hard in the fields and her nights listening to her father spin fantastic tales about the Jade Dragon and the Old Man of the Moon.

But Minli believes these enchanting stories and embarks on an extraordinary journey to find the Old Man of the Moon and ask him how her family can change their fortune.
