That\u2019s exactly what a New York City man had to ask himself when he found an infant on the ACE subway platform. Author, Yona Zeldis McDonough, a Brooklyn native, was so taken by this story that it was the inspiration for this book.Miranda was content in the thought that she may never be a mother. In her mid-thirties and single, the chances weren\u2019t looking too good. But she had a great job and amazing friends. Things definitely could be worse. Her life changed one night when she was heading home from a night out with the girls. Walking through the subway station, she spied the usual sights \u2026 people running to catch their train, a homeless person huddling in the corner, but it wasn\u2019t until she saw a little bundle with a foot sticking out that she stopped to take notice. At first, she thought maybe it was a doll, but when the foot moved she knew that she stumbled upon something more than a child\u2019s discarded toy. She found someone\u2019s discarded baby! After turning the baby over to the local police, Miranda couldn\u2019t get the thought of that little baby out of her mind. She went to the court to inquire about the infant and was shocked when she was asked to consider fostering the baby. A bit nervous, what did she know about raising a baby?, she decided to take on the challenge. It didn\u2019t take long for her to fall in love with this child, whom she named Celeste. But when a local paper got wind of the story and asked to do an interview, things got complicated. A man claiming to be the baby\u2019s father surfaced and was looking to claim his child. Heartbroken and confused, Miranda was torn between fighting for the baby that she loved and returning her to the rightful parent.As a foster and adoptive parent, this book spoke volumes to me. I could relate to much of what Miranda was going through with the inner turmoil of loving a child unconditionally, yet knowing that they can be taken from you without question. The joys that a child brings to your life, and the sorrows of the unknown. The author does a brilliant job of bringing out real, raw emotions while making you feel like you\u2019re living the story along with Miranda. A heart-wrenching story about love, family, sacrifices \u2026 life! Go out and get this book. You won\u2019t be able to put it down until you hit the last page!"}, {"userName": "Dolores", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34377506-dolores", "userReview": "Miranda Berenzweig has good friends, a great job as food editor of a magazine, and is getting over an unfortunate relationship when she finds an abandoned newborn baby on the subway platform. After taking the little girl to the nearest police station, she goes home....hoping the baby will find a loving family. But Miranda worries about her and keeps in touch with the handling of her case. The judge suggests that Miranda become her foster mother and possibly adopt her. But complications arise when the baby's father shows up. This was actually quite interesting. If you like chick lit romantic novels I'm sure you'll love \"You Were Meant for Me\". But for me it was just too corny!

And what a perfect title! Fate, in the form of an abandoned infant, confronts our heroine at her loneliest hour. What unfolds after this magical beginning is both psychologically astute and a glimpse into the meaning of life.

A well blended combination of love, happiness, acceptance, loss, sorrow and friendship. Sure some of those may mean similar things, but the situations are different.The story is primarily about Miranda and the baby she finds abandoned at a subway station in NY. It is the end of the line and Miranda is there because she fell asleep and missed her stop. Perhaps that was a good thing. Miranda follows up on the baby and manages to become her foster mother on the road to adoption...much to the chagrin of some of her friends.I loved the story and felt like I was there and part of the story. Not everything was easy for Miranda during this journey, but she is very level headed and knew when she wouldn't win. Bea, Lauren and Courtney round out her friends and they all bring something different to the story. Courtney has more of a personal story line than Lauren or Bea, but she is fairly opposite of Miranda, so that is probably why.Jared, the baby's father, has some life changing experiences and it causes him to grow up faster than maybe he would have liked.And then there is Evan, photographer extraordinaire, and possibly the love of Miranda's life. But is his timing right for a relationship to happen?Overall very enjoyable story"}, {"userName": "Lia Mack", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5151013-lia-mack", "userReview": "I loved this book! And yes, the cover is what caught my eye ;)This story, although rooted in a sad, true one, turns sweet within a heartbeat through Yona's characters and her smooth writing style.I like the way the author handled all the touchy subjects in this book. Obviously either very close to the author's life or very well researched. Either way, a great read. Very entertaining. Likable, relocatable characters. What touched me most was the honest emotions and situations the characters of YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME went through. I enjoy women's fiction because of the emotional journey and growth of the women in the book. And this book did not disappoint.

She is just coming off a break-up with a disappointing guy, but she's ok; she just got a promotion at work and she is getting on with her life. All is well.As Miranda makes her way home from a night out with her girlfriends, her life changes. Finding an abandoned newborn on the Brooklyn subway station leads her to unexpected, but oh, so wanted, motherhood. Miranda has never known such happiness, but then the biological father enters the picture. Jared hadn't realized that his unstable girlfriend was telling the truth when she told him she was pregnant; now he has to decide whether to be a stand-up kind of guy and be a father or whether to pretend it all never happened in the first place. He does the \"right\" thing and heartache begins.The concept of the story was great, but for me, this story just didn't even begin to relate all the pain and all the struggles a foster parent or adoptive parent must go through. Miranda had it fairly easy--she was able to hire a full-time nanny and to get on with her life. She fell immediately into another relationship. Jared came across as, well, just sleazy; even though he did do the \"right\" thing for his daughter. He, too, had all the comforts in his life that would allow him to hire a nanny and a back-up in order for him to follow his own lifestyle as up and coming realtor with wealthy clients, especially the wealthy, attractive wives.For the characters to have been in their mid-thirties, I found them to \"figures on a stick\". I never got to really know them and I found their thirty-something behavior to be immature...but maybe I just don't understand the City Life and Successful Singles. I just didn't feel the pain or the struggles that someone who found a baby and wanted to adopt would really go through, or at least what I think they would go through. The book became more about the relationship issues than about the baby. There were a lot of back and forth relationships that clouded the main issue and took up a lot of pages with little substance. It seemed that McDonough was trying too hard to show diversity in characters--a lesbian, up and coming African Americans, an elderly man with Alzheimer's, a middle-eastern nanny, a mentally unstable woman....yes, these are people in our lives; but McDonough didn't trust the reader figure it all out; she was quick to point it out in print that her characters were a diverse mix.In the end, all works out; rather abruptly, but happily. I happily closed the book and then thought that what could have been a really moving story just turned out to be a light, fluffy and not even funny work of chic lit; which I like from time to time, but which just didn't seem fair to this story line."}, {"userName": "Kathryn Laceby", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17958040-kathryn-laceby", "userReview": "Originally reviewed at Novel EscapesI finished reading You Were Meant For Me with mixed feelings. While the concept was great (both unusual and interesting) I had a hard time with the pace on occasion and some of the emotional connections throughout. There were so many good things about it though, that on the whole I enjoyed the book.Miranda is still a bit of a mystery to me. Sometimes I felt as if she\u2019d got everything in her life under control: the great position at work where she\u2019s well respected, the adult way she\u2019s handling her father\u2019s dementia and the control she takes when she realises she\u2019d like to foster (and possibly adopt) the baby she discovered. They all showed a woman who knows what she wants and how to go about getting it. My confusion lay with the personal relationships throughout the novel. She has an almost grade-school relationship with her friends which I couldn\u2019t really fathom. I know that no one has everything sorted out but I still would have expected Miranda to have more than one friend (the actress) who had the maturity to help her when she needed it. They didn\u2019t add much of anything to the story except frustration. However the older women (the nanny and the landlady) presented in the novel were both wonderful and I suppose were there to represent the mother figure for Miranda when her friends proved to be unhelpful.I was almost ready to accept Miranda\u2019s new life with baby Celeste and potential partner Evan when we were thrown the curve ball of baby\u2019s biological father Jared turning up. I actually liked his character and his purpose to the plot (potential romantic interest aside) and despite him having some questionable personality traits I found myself understanding him. I think his intentions were good and the author was careful to let us know his relationship with his own mother had been a loving one and that he respected her greatly. I think his feelings regarding the baby\u2019s mother were also genuine.You Were Meant For Me was an interesting book and while I had some reservations about some of the secondary players I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the novel or pick up another by the same author.Thank you to Penguin Random House for our review copy.

So when I saw the plot of this book, I knew I had to read it.The plot goes like this: Miranda Berenzweig (I had no idea how to pronounce it, so she was just Miranda B in my head) finds an abandoned baby girl. Miranda B decides to adopt the baby girl. She's 35 with no kids of her own and is not in a relationship. This baby might be her only chance to have a kid. Miranda decides to do an interview with a magazine about finding the baby girl. Through this magazine, the father of the baby girl comes forward. He wants the baby. Dun-dun-DUN.It turns out the baby girl's mother was a bit crazy. She wasn't stable. She apparently left her baby and then drowned herself.The father, Jared, thinks he needs to do the right thing and raise the baby. Miranda B named her Celeste. Jared changes it to Lily. (Oh, and sorry if this is a spoiler, but he takes custody in the middle of the book, so it's not a total shocker..) But Jared doesn't think he's cut out to be a father after all, so he wants to give Lily back to Miranda, because he feels like she'll be better off. I mean, I wanted Miranda to be happy, but at the same time, dude, man UP, this is your flesh and blood. Then again, he knows he's not the best parent and he does want what's best for Lily. So Miranda gets Lily back and changes the baby's name BACK to Celeste. The poor kid is probably like \"WTF? Who AM I?\"Does the custody arrangement stay that way?

I began reading it on a Saturday evening and stayed up late to keep in the wonderful company of this story. On Sunday morning I sank back down into it and finished late that day, feeling as if I'd been given a delicious treat of wisdom, savviness, shrewd observation, and profound intimacy. Ms. McDonough conveys the way we register need and desire, the way we build families, the way an inner yearning can surprise someone in its fulfillment.I enjoyed, as well, the way the artistry of the writing. As with other novels by the same author, I felt her incisive knowledge of human nature and of the way the world operates, and I found myself putting stars in the margins at moments that illuminated for me something unexpected and significant about human nature. Her understanding of women's friendships -- their occasionally competitive edge, their ways of healing from ruptures -- also spoke to me. There are certain favorite movies that I watch when I'm blue; I'm grateful to them for captivating me and pulling me into their world. I am grateful to You Were Meant for Me for casting the same compelling spell, and for bringing me so much information about the world and the human heart.
