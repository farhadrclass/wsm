And then won it.I never read the first book, because I typically stay away from books with a heart on the cover, so there were some parts that I didn't really get. However, S.G. did a good job of filling in most of the blanks. Behind the story of a thinking zombie is the story of what Christmas is like for the child of a single alcoholic mother. It tugged at the heart strings a little, although I was hoping for more of an anti-happy ending. But I think that speaks more to my taste as a reader.Good book for the Holidays. Although it was a gore filled holiday read."}, {"userName": "Kathy Worrell  \u30c4 ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4994087-kathy-worrell", "userReview": "Zombies?

It's a good thing that he can still manage some snark with his lips sewn shut...right?This is a zombie read with real brains. In fact, in most cases the zombies are not only smarter than the \"breathers,\" but funnier and more compassionate as well.After you get over the fact that Andy and his fellow zombies are suffering from various stages of decomposition; it is very easy to see how human they really are.

Thanks to Gallery Books and Goodreads for allowing me the opportunity to review this book. I read Browne\u2019s book Breathers when it was released a few years ago and really enjoyed it. I was really looking forward to reading this book as well. This ended up being a fun, yet short, zombie Christmas read. It was gory, disturbing, entertaining, and even a bit heart-warming.This book picks up where Breathers left off. Andy is being held in an experimental facility. This book is mostly about Andy escaping from that experimental facility and then returning to rescue some friends. In between this he meets a sweet eleven year old girl who mistakes him for the one and only Santa. She wants nothing more than for her mother to spend some time with her once in awhile and Andy is determined to help her out.This was a fun read but pretty short, it took a little over an hour to read. This is full of the wit and dark humor Browne is known for. It was a very well written and engaging story that was hard to put down.As with Breathers this is a zombie book with gore, violence, dark humor, and surprisingly some heart as well. Parts of the book are laugh out loud funny and others are disturbingly gory...in between all of this the story is surprisingly touching. Andy is a loyal and courageous zombie who knows how to live his unlife better than most live humans life their lives. Along the way he reminds a mother of her duty to her daughter and reminds us all of the true meaning of Christmas spirit.Overall a great read, I really enjoyed it. This is a truly unique, if somewhat disturbing holiday read. Recommended to zombie fans and those who enjoy dark humor.

G. BrowneMy initial reaction to this book was less than stellar. I made an assumption (you can guess where this is going.) that is was going to be roughly in the sheer idiocy category. Well, imagine my surprise when I enjoyed the book. The story is the deprivation of zombies by society and the zombie side of the story.Andy Warner portrays a poignant, abused figure in this tale of discrimination. I\u2019m not sure black humor aptly describes the book or the plot. Perhaps demented black humor fits the bill a bit better. The story and plot are believable from a zombie point of view. Of course, according to the main character, zombies have very limited points of view. Surprisingly there is a note of reality in the reaction of society and the benefits that might be derived from some zombie traits. Plus the sentimental aspects of both Andy and bit player Shannon are surprising as well. The story is both disturbingly funny and touching at the same time. This is a book that should be wildly successful in the thirteen to fifteen age group who revels in the destruction of zombies. The title will attract them while driving away many who would be startled to discover that is a good Christmas tale.

It's written with the same fast wit and imagery that we've grown accustomed to with S.G. Browne's work and I couldn't be happier having the chance to read it before the release date on October 30th, 2012.We start off the story with Andy, in a zombie research facility in Portland, Oregon. He was the leader of a zombie uprising, after which a lot of new zombie laws were put into place. There's a tip of the hat to A Clockwork Orange and the Christmas movies of our past. Unlike Scott's other books, this one doesn't have the traditional love interest, but you still feel warm and fuzzy, don't worry about that! The best part about this book is that it's truly a Christmas Story. It takes the new view on zombie's that Browne did in the past, puts the Christmas twist on it, and it still holds up. In all reality, when I first heard that he was doing this, I thought it would be a cheesy, if not cheap marketing ploy. He quickly re-affirmed exactly why I enjoy his work so much after I sat down and read the book in one sitting.It's a quick 200 pages and if you're looking for your fill of zombies, holiday cheer, and some breathers getting what they deserve, Scott's done it again with this one"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/779507-nicole", "userReview": "\"If I Only Had Some Brainslyrics by Andy WarnerI could gnaw away the hoursDelightfully devourDigesting Johns and JanesAnd my mouth I'd be fillin'While my hands were busy killin' If I only had some brainsI'd faddle and I'd fiddleFat fry you on the griddleSauteing your remainsOn you flesh I'd be snackin'And your skull I would be crackin'If I only had some brainsOh, ever since I've diedI've longed for blood and goreJust to sit and eat the brains that I adoreAnd then I'd sit and eat some moreI would bake you in a muffinComplete you with some stuffin'Or maybe some whole grainsIn a shake made with dairyI would top you with a cherryIf I only had some brains\"THIS is worth memorizing :D"}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298692-alexandra", "userReview": "A fun story with surprising heart!

Browne\u2019s first published novel) is every bit as wonderful- if not more wonderful than its predecessor. I could read a whole series of books set in the Breather\u2018s universe! Set one year after the first book, I Saw Zombies contains some spoilers to the original including the fate of its main characters. But, if you merely want to read a, \u201c\u2026 Holly-jolly- zombie Christmas\u201d story about a girl and her zombie who spreads Christmas cheer you don\u2019t necessarily need to read the first book. But you should.The novel and the novella are both set in a world where resurrections are a semi-regular occurrence, but beyond researching on the undead and locking them up in pounds, not much structure is in place to deal with them. Having been officially labeled dead by the government, all zombies are stripped of their social security numbers and their rights. They are literally the living dead in the eyes of the world. It\u2019s enough to break your still beating heart.Main character Andy is the former poster boy for the zombie rights movement, but due to the events of Breathers, he is being held in and quickly escapes from a local research facility. The novella itself opens on a body farm where research for Reanimant Forensics are done on the most unlucky zombies in the bunch. Since Andy has a giant hole in his head, the the narrative pieces together the missing bits of his memories, from his research facility escape all the way through his Christmas antics to how he wound up surrounded by decaying peers. Just another day in the life of the undead.Inside the research lab, zombies are tested on. They have their mouths sewn shut, have horrible tests performed on them and are basically treated like animals. Not that animals should be treated in such a manner either. Ugh. Don\u2019t worry, there will be a PETA satire that I\u2019ll discuss a little later.The silver lining is that through reading about these inhumane practices, Browne teaches us a little bit about the zombie science in this alternate US of A. In the lab, researchers are looking into the Resurrection Gene which only a small section of the population has present in them. This gene allows them to regenerate after death and might hold the key to curing disease and reverse the effects of aging. Through the pain of zombie test subjects of course. Worst catch-22 ever. You can be immortal, but we have to torture your resurrected relatives to do so! ARGH!A new addition in this novella is that POVs are given to characters outside of Andy, and they\u2019re female! In all the other S.G. Browne works I\u2019ve read (Fated, Lucky Bastard, and Shooting Monkeys in a Barrel) this is the first time he\u2019s given us a female narrator. That I can remember- there were a lot of wonderful short stories in Shooting Monkeys and I certainly don\u2019t remember the gender of that shampoo bottle.Anyway, female narrators. Yes, that\u2019s where I was. Browne gives narrative power to one of the researchers, specifically Shannon, a bald headed lady with a heart of gold and a secret weakness for RC-1854- reanimated corpse 1854 (Andy). It\u2019s through her that we get to learn all about the Resurrection Gene and the attitude by the researchers toward the zombies. The are not people, they are not even their genders. They are its. It\u2019s a testament to Browne\u2019s character building that you learn to care for these characters, they\u2019re not rotting and dismembered its they\u2019re people. Albeit smelly people. Zombies are people too!The second POV is given to a young girl with a not too cheerful childhood (a dead father, an alcoholic absentee mother) who gets a little Christmas cheer from her new zombie Santa friend. The ways in which they help each other deal with their inner pain will warm your heart. D\u2019awwwww. Just the perfect touch of love you want out of your Christmas reads. Plus brain eating, although these two plot lines don\u2019t necessarily go hand in hand, or brain in mouth.As with S.G. Browne\u2019s other works, this novella is chock full of satire. First is the appearance of PETZ (People for the Ethical Treatment of Zombies) on obvious play on PETA, who arrives to release the zombies from their cages but don\u2019t actually help them beyond that. Sounds about right, helpful but not necessarily effective. PETA, you have your hearts in the right place but that doesn\u2019t mean you always accomplish anything helpful. What do you plan to do with those 20 rabbits who have been testing lipstick!?!My favorite parody however would have to be Andy\u2019s rendition of \u201cIf I Only Had a Brain\u201d, retitled to the appropriate \u201cIf I Only Had Some Brains\u201d.I could gnaw away the hoursDelightfully devourDigesting John and JanesAnd my mouth I\u2019d be fillin\u2019While my hands were busy killin\u2019If I only had some brainsFinally, to indicate the changing zombie sentiment since Andy\u2019s capture we are given a glimpse into the zombie reality television choices available for the masses. When Andy last watched television Dancing With the Undead dominated the airwaves, but things have changed since then. Once he\u2019s returned to the land of the living however, people are entertaining themselves with World\u2019s Wildest Zombie Chases. Ruh-roh. Looks like there needs to be a third book in this series (SURPRISE TRILOGY!) to track Andy\u2019s efforts in reversing zombie animosity again. ::puppy dog eyes::Less zom-rom-com (zombie-romantic-comedy) than Breathers and more a satire on the animal testing industry and the importance of connections with family (read: the true meaning of Christmas) I Saw Zombies is the perfect addition to your Christmas/Halloween cross-over collection, right next to The Nightmare Before Christmas! It\u2019s a niche market, but one that has double the potential because it can be enjoyed twice a year.

G. Browne. Reason 1: Zombies we care about, that would still eat us. In \u201cI Saw Zombies Eating Santa Claus,\u201d we encounter Andy\u2014a zombie who is being experimented on in a lab, after having gone on a cannibalistic rampage when humans sabotaged his peaceful demonstration for Zombie rights. Andy escapes the lab, with the help of human activists, and must find a way to return to save his Zombie friends from the lab, while also trying to help a neglected human girl who thinks he's Santa. So Zombies in this universe are sentient, but make no mistake that they need human flesh in order for their bodily cells to recover and function. So the book creates in us a wonderful sort of ambivalence towards them. Reason 2: Christmas without the seizure-inducing, flashing, Christmas lights. Around the holidays, most seasonally themed books and movies are awful. They are way too flashy (I'm looking at you Rudolph), too sappy (unless you're Marv and Harry, my patron saints), and reuse the same contrived, happily-ever-after plot as the rest (with Santa flying into the full moon\u2014seriously, does Christmas EVER fall on a cloudy half-moon?). \u201cI Saw Zombies Eating Santa Claus\u201d creates a truly seasonal story, somewhat akin to \u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d but with the spirit of realism, and in a world with actual consequences. Reason 3: A guide for Zombies, after the apocalypse. Sure, we all have our zombie plans for when the apocalypse comes. But what if we find ourselves on the other side of the block? What if we're turned, while still sentient, and we have to deal with all the meals on wheels trying to end out existence? These are questions that \u201cI Saw Zombies Eating Santa Claus\u201d was created to address, including hunting strategies, human-based recipes for the more refined Zombie, Zombie melodies, and codes of Zombie ethics.Reason 4: A cutting and relevant social criticism.While it's not overbearing, there are definite themes of social criticism in this book. It made me question who the real-life Zombies are in this world, how we treat them when they demand dignity and respect, and how fear leads to apathetic allowance for those in power to make our laws more cruel towards those most in need. I highly recommend this for holiday or non-holiday reading\u2014for fun, or for trying to find something deeper. And I will be finding and reviewing more books by S. G. Browne in the coming year.

You got it.Alex Winter, the undead narrator of Breathers, finds himself the object of incessant experimentation and torment at a government research facility. He escapes and, because of his long white hair and beard, quickly dresses as Santa Claus. The story that follows is an amusing little Christmas tale, a blend of humor, horror, and holiday cheer.A few thoughts: - I\u2019ve read Browne\u2019s short story \u201cZombie Gigolo,\u201d so I can attest that he has no shortage of verbiage or vocabulary to describe the unheimlich experience of the undead. Given that this book has a jaunty Santa on the cover and will probably be aimed at non-hardcore readers, he wisely keeps this aspect of the tale rather muted. But I appreciate the careful consideration of the role putrefaction takes in the Breathers world. Gas bloating, for instance, makes zombies fart. - The book includes a sub-plot about a child with disappointing prospects for Christmas (as all holiday tales must), and the interaction between her and Alex works very well. The resonance with the daughter he hasn\u2019t seen is quite strong and well-written. Browne gives real pathos to the story. - I like the fine line the book explores about the ethics of zombies eating people. I\u2019m sure this is more fully covered in Breathers, but he gives it just the right amount of consideration here. One premise Browne uses is that human meat helps zombies regenerate, meaning they must eat people to stay \u2018alive.\u2019 It creates a great tension, but also allows for a future story where human analog has been invented and zombies can be people like the vampires in True Blood. - I think Browne\u2019s assessment of how people would generally deal with zombies is apt \u2014 there would be some who have an \u201canimal\u2019s rights\u201d approach to the question, but many would allow all kinds of horrors to be perpetrated on them, just as most of us who don\u2019t pay attention to where our meat comes from allow for the animals we eat. Browne draws a connection to our treatment of \u201cterrorists\u201d since 9/11 that resonates strongly if you let it. - This book has multiple zombie Santa Clauses. Tell me that isn\u2019t awesome. You\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s awesome. (To be clear, I mean zombies dressed as Santa Claus. I don\u2019t mean the actual supernatural present delivering elf is turned into a zombie.)All in all, an entertaining holiday tale that\u2019s ALSO an entertaining zombie tale.

It\u2019s a Christmas miracle like no other; one you won\u2019t soon forget.Andy Warner is having problems. Other than being a zombie, he\u2019s also a test subject in a horrible lab, where the employees care nothing about their zombie guinea pigs and will poke and prod, burn and dismember, and do whatever they feel like with them. But after the unfolding events of Breathers, this is what his life has become now. Zombies no longer have any rights whatsoever; many have been put to rest permanently, while those still around are trapped in these labs across the country. But Andy has a plan to spring him and his fellow zombies out of this prison, along with the help of a zombie support group.Once on the outside, Andy does his best to keep his friends safe, but also make sure they have a regular supply of fresh human to keep them healthy and well. Funnily enough, when people treat you like nothing more than a corpse in a lab, you don\u2019t care that much when you want to eat them. But the people from the lab are looking for them, scouring the city, and eventually they will be found. Though Andy also knows he has an ally in one of the laboratory employees, but doesn\u2019t know why.And in the middle of all this, Andy meets a lonely nine year-old girl who believes he\u2019s Santa, because he was dressed as Santa (the perfect disguise at Christmas) and wants just one gift in the whole world: to have her bad parent of a mother pay more attention to her and love her. So now Andy has a guilt problem to deal with, as well as to save all his zombie friends and himself from getting caught and thrown back in the lab. He knows if he gets caught, he\u2019ll end up on the body farm this time.Browne does a great job of replicating the voice and tone of Breathers, putting you right back in the world he created and making you realize how much you missed it. Andy even comes up with a few haikus to entertain you. Readers will be thrilled with this Christmas present, and be left wondering if Browne will be writing any more adventures of Andy and his unusual gang.Originally written on December 4, 2012 \u00a9Alex C.

Zombies aren't just brainless things, but pretty much sentients with a taste (and need) for human flesh. They remember their old memories, and some of them stay with their families for some time. Zombieism isn't a random disease either, but a random mutation. Some people reanimate after death; others just die.But then we humans decide that since they're [un]dead, we'll experiment on them to see if we can cure diseases.Too bad the zombies escape.Andy Warner is a zombie anomaly. Not because he fell asleep while driving and killed his wife, orphaning his daughter Annie, but because he's survived for two years. Well, survived and NOT gone crazy like the \"twins\" have. He craves human flesh but is dignified in how he picks and chooses who/what to eat.

The scientists try to control life over death, dehumanize the corpses, and some are psychopathic in their behavior.Shannon works at the facility and is unlike a lot of the other workers. She comes to humanize the zombies, particularly Andy, and has a small hand in helping him survive his breakout (and break in to rescue his other zombie friends).The side story of another girl named Annie (a year or two older than Andy's daughter) is adorable. She comes from a home with a deceased father and half-drunk mother, and is still a kind and open soul. She deserves more love than she gets, and I love how Andy helps her.I had so much fun reading this (2013)! The reread was just as good (2014).In my third reread, I found this to be as funny as the first times - though I can't believe it's been 3 years since I last read it!"}, {"userName": "Kim Miner Litton", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3795990-kim-miner-litton", "userReview": "I felt Breathers was pretty perfect on its own and didn't think I wanted or needed a sequel, but I am a huge fan of the author and won this book in a contest on his blog.*READ BOOK ONE FIRST, AS THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BREATHERS: A ZOMBIE'S LAMENT*It was satisfying to see, after the ending of Breathers, that at least Andy, everyone's favorite angsty Zombie, survived his zombie last stand. He enters a bit of a \"chosen one\" sort of path here. He's different for some reason, which is why he gets so much attention at the lab he's being held prisoner.I enjoyed this follow up, it was certainly full of the same gross out, dark humor one expects from Breathers, along with clever dialogue. In novella form, however, I had a lot more trouble keeping Andy's new zombie compatriots straight than I did with his support group in the first book. We didn't get to know them as well, and they weren't as distinctive.I'm a Christmas romantic, and even Zombies have a yuletide spirit, it seems. While this is no Debbie Macomber Christmas book, it does still leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling.My biggest wish for Browne going forth is to add a little more depth to his female characters. This one, even more than Breathers, is a sausage fest. I'd really like him to make his female characters more than props to the male characters. Also, there's a plotline in here that comes dangerously close to slut-shaming, though I'm fairly certain that wasn't the authors intent. Browne's main female characters in other stories have little personality beyond being love with the main male protagonist. There is a female doctor in this story who seems to have a bit of interest to her, but she's pretty elusive and then the story ends."}, {"userName": "Denise Spicer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46980682-denise-spicer", "userReview": "This cute, amusing, gross, and kind of sad story about the unlikely meeting between a re-animated Zombie undead and a little girl who needs some special Christmas cheer is heartwarming but does have some disgusting details.

The premise hooked me even more. From there, all it took was page one to get me entrenched into the delightful world of Breathers and Zombies.Admittedly, I was expecting something along the lines of Christopher Moore's raucous hilarity. I was more reminded of Dave Barry's quirky, lively, fast-paced style, which was no less joyous. At any rate, it was quite enjoyable, and the entire time I felt eager to know what happened next - what is Andy going to do? How is he going to get out of this? Who's he going to meet next?...and so forth.Having not read the first book, I did not know about Browne's spin on zombies. I must say I prefer his interpretation of them, and how they seem to maintain their humanity even though they are now undead. This is not your typical Hollywood gush-and-gore, violent showism. These reanimates maintain some semblance of being human (maybe even moreso than actual Breathers!), and is shown throughout this funny yet oddly touching story. For being a zombie, Andy and his friends have admirable morals and do not hesitate to do what they can to help each other. I'd want them as friends, certainly!Funny. Clever. Heartwarming. I loved this book, and must have more! I highly recommend this as a Christmas gift for anyone who likes a good story, a little humor, and some good ol' zombies."}, {"userName": "Cale", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9288112-cale", "userReview": "Maybe I just don't get the satire. Maybe it's a meta book, where the story itself is less important than the overall feeling. Because the plot moved like a zombie; plodding, brainless and slow. But the story didn't. Is he satirizing Christmas stories by putting a 'zombie' in it? Or is he satirizing 'zombie' books by putting what could just as easily been a diabetic prisoner in it? Either way, it just didn't work for me. The book is a sequel, but it still takes a quarter of it to set up the plot, which then meanders with very little direction. And calling these characters zombies is very misleading - the definition of zombie in this context has little in common with the traditional tropes. I picked this up because the title was just so over-the-top I couldn't imagine where the story would go from there. Apparently, neither could the author. It's not horrible, but it's dull. Which is not something I'd ever think I'd use to describe a book about zombies."}, {"userName": "Yuyine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59919867-yuyine", "userReview": "Je ne vous le cache pas, le premier opus des aventures zombiesques d\u2019Andy Warner avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un immense coup de coeur!

It seems to be a trio and this is the middle book. An interesting take on zombies - the only thing that makes them a zombie is that they are the undead and that they eat humans to keep themselves alive and keeps them from rotting. Other then that they can be perceived as \"Breathers\" This is about Andy who became a zombie after a car wreck that left his wife dead. Apparently it's a gene that's passed done, but not everyone is affected. This second book is about his life in a laboratory being experimented on by scientists. He escapes and it goes from there. It's a lighthearted read, yes, I know there is some people eating involved, but it's not crazy gory.

I loved this tale about as much as I'd loved the first novel by Browne entitled Breathers. I remember meeting Browne at ZomBCon a few years ago and asking if he'd ever consider continuing on with the tale of Andy. I'm so glad he did. This was a perfect novel to read for Christmas time, whether you love Christmas or zombies. The story continues with Andy being in a research facility for Zombies. We follow him as he breaks out and then watch as he returns to free the other zombies in the facility. The story is both humorous, heartwarming and very well done. I'd love to see another addition to this series but I totally think it could all end with this one. Job well done, S.G.
