I won't lie it's very short but it truly is the shopping trip from hell . Cassie is determined to get all her present shopping done but enemies and other things get in her way. It's hilarious, it's also kind of sad but the ending was just so typical of everything that those around her usually bring to the story. Poignant and full of atmosphere and now I'm champing at the bit for Dorys book plus of course there's the matter of Cassie , Mircea and his wife !"}, {"userName": "Sophia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063928-sophia", "userReview": "Just a fun short story about Cassie taking Fred, one of her vampire guards with her for a Christmas shopping trip in the Shadowlands where all hell breaks loose.
