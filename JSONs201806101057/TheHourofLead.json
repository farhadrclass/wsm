Some barked and others howled; still more nipped one another in their anxiety. The cooking meat stirred their stomachs and they leaped to break the ridgeline, stout horses and good hemp rope knotted on a pair of saddle horns all that held them.Some below glanced at the animals but dismissed them. Animals were drawn to a meal that didn't require the effort of killing. They would all be scavengers if circumstances permitted. People differed little, Matt realized; most would eat a beef steak or chicken leg, skinned and plucked and cut and papered and piled into their freezers or root cellars rather than kill and butcher for themselves. For a man civility seemed the ladder out of the melee; otherwise, like his animal brethren, a man only survives. Straight up killers seemed more moral, though. They turned lives into food knowing the flesh their teeth ground and their tongues savored and their gullets swallowed breathed an hour or a day or a minute before. The recognized their own existence was constructed upon slaughter, and the debt they owed their victims could never be repaid, simply owed. It seemed to Matt, though the meals arrived on porcelain and cooked, the scene below was no less savage.it's my favorite kind of book, perfectly executed. get on this one, country-noir friends o'mine."}, {"userName": "Tuck", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565487-tuck", "userReview": "kick ass eastern washington grit lit or how far will you go to keep your dream alive? all the way?"}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "THE HOUR OF LEAD. (2014). Bruce Holbert. ***.This was the author\u2019s second novel; his first, \u201cLonesome Animals,\u201d was named the Best Book of 2012 by The Seattle Times. As is my usual practice, I read this one first. It is not likely to be named as a Best Book of the Year, although the writing is strong and lyrical. It is a story set in Eastern Washington state about a family who doesn\u2019t have much luck. The protagonist is Matt Lawson, whom we meet as a young boy along with his twin brother, Luke. One winter, both brothers were out in a horrific snow storm and became separated. Luke was ultimately found, but had not survived the storm. Their father was also a victim of the storm, but his body was not found until much later. While searching for his father, Matt hooks up with a young girl \u2013 a neighbor, Wendy Worden. You soon assume that this joint search effort will lead to something greater, but it really doesn\u2019t. After a little while, Matt soon discovers that he has potentially missed something, and begins to shower Wendy with small gifts, but makes no real move to get closer to her. It\u2019s a strange relationship. The author then throws in a gap of sixteen years, while giving Matt a chance to grow up and become a vigorous cowboy. He turns into one of the strangest cowhands you have ever known. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any normal emotions, but goes after problems in a Neanderthal way. I could muster no liking for Matt. Wendy ultimately appears again, but by this time she has become someone different. Many of the scenes in this novel are primitive in nature. You expect that Matt will have to take on responsibility on his own after losing his father and brother, but he does so with a total lack of emotion as situations arise that should normally evoke some actions of feeling. I could not connect with any of the author\u2019s characters, and the plot wandered around a lot. I do plan to go back and read his first novel, just to see what all of the praise was about. The author does write in a poetic style, but that can\u2019t overcome a cock-a-mamie plot structure or flat characters."}, {"userName": "Roberta Emerson", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8552725-roberta-emerson", "userReview": "Initially excited to read a book set where I grew up, taking place 100 years ago, the forced attempt at lyrical prose was off putting. Then at about page 60, there was a page and a half of beautiful writing. The story was alternately engaging and confusing. But this rating is primarily due to the incredible amount of senseless violence throughout, at times thoroughly revolting.

Set in Eastern Washington; hard to describe - not a \"Western,\" almost....well, it reminded me (which is dangerous ground, my memory) of the old Clint Eastwood movie, \"The Beguiled.\" Take the roof off of any house, and you will find stories about people like those in this affecting and finely wrought novel.

Try the first chapter of this book & then try to complain. From that wild beginning, I found the characters interesting and the plot surprising. Only one thing late in the book didn't feel \"right\" given what the author has told us about his characters and lives. And, in a real treat for me, the events in the book largely take place in rural Washington State, within 150 miles of where I live, and where I've been in my travels.

He captures the complexity of the human condition--our hopes, fears, our propensity to both love and violence, and the intersection of the two. His characters do inexplicable things, and leave me to realize it is useless to wonder why people do what they do.Despite that, I do wonder why the main character does what he does at the end. It seemed incongruous to me, so I couldn't give it 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Scott Underwood", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40426429-scott-underwood", "userReview": "DNF. Got about 50 pages in and realized I did not care about these characters and I did not appreciate the over-effort to paint pictures. What's that they say about good musicians? It's not the notes they play, it's the ones they don't. Too many notes that didn't need to be played here.--*Update*--The day after I put this down with a DNF I picked it up again. From about page 70 or so it started to feel like a story and then became one. One that interested me, though I still am confused by some of the dialogue and descriptors. Some paragraphs just down right confuse me. In the end, I was geared up for a very bad something.....something unexpected, like the author's first novel, but better heads prevailed, though I'm stymied as to what the gold, flat, metal thing was.

He mythologizes the region with Faulknerian fervor--Saturday night/Sunday morning elocution, semi-mute characters with a penchant for gore, Gothic preoccupation with pain and dark humor, and a recognition, in Eudora Welty's words, that setting is \"the crossroads of circumstance . . . by confining character, it defines it.\u201d Comparisons with Cormac McCarthy abound. I would add William Goyen and the more westerning works of Brian Evenson. What I didn't expect in THE HOUR OF LEAD--Who would after LONESOME ANIMALS?--were the moments of sentimentality that now and then relieve the characters of their existential blightedness. Both novels belong on every required reading list of Northwest literature."}, {"userName": "Dale", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4498938-dale", "userReview": "a much better read (less violent, more intrigue) than the previous book read by this author (see 2015/#30); this story is divided into \u201cparts\u201d and at the end of one section I leaned back in my chair, hands clasped overhead and smiled: it\u2019s that kind of book.

As his mother disappears into grief, Matt learns the hardest lesson the west has to teach: he is on his own. The necessity of work stabilizes young Matt against the pitfalls of first love with Wendy, the daughter of a local grocer, and their ragged end will sent Matt on a journey across the county, leaving Wendy to tend the ranch with local schoolteacher Linda Jefferson and her unwieldy son Lucky. It will take decades for Matt to learn his way back home, and that long journey will have great impact on all of those around him.Invoking the same beautiful landscape and language of his critically-acclaimed debut, The Hour of Lead is a wider, more expansive novel, less violent but just as affecting, another important contribution to the literature of the west.", "title": "The Hour of Lead", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668218-the-hour-of-lead", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385522449l/18668218.jpg", "reviews": 28, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3318033.Bruce_Holbert", "name": "Bruce Holbert"}], "type": ["Westerns", "Fiction", "Historical", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668218-the-hour-of-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23281511-the-hour-of-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22675964-the-hour-of-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13074464-lonesome-animals", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35259576-whiskey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26196390-thank-you-teacher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7568007-signed-your-student"]}
