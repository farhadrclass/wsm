Jade needs to figure Caleb out before he breaks her grandmother\u2019s heart\u2026and Jade\u2019s too! (Goodreads)Review:The characters were well rounded and well developed. I liked all of the characters that I met and am looking forward to spending more time with them in future books. I really enjoyed the fact that the characters were a mixture of ages: some were senior citizens and some were millennials. It was kind of heartwarming to see the younger people caring for and being concerned with the welfare of the older ones.The author did a great job in creating the setting: an assisted living retail community of the Kinsey Falls. I was really intrigued by this concept and thought it was a great idea. The author is very talented in her descriptive writing and through most of the book I felt like I was right there, walking in the knitting shop and seeing all the beautiful colors and textures. It pulled me into the story right from the beginning.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well crafted women\u2019s fiction. This was a feel good story and I am looking forward to reading the next one in the series."}, {"userName": "Leslie aka StoreyBook Reviews", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272944-leslie-aka-storeybook-reviews", "userReview": "This is a novella and not a cozy (even though the author does write cozies) but it was so enjoyable! I think what I liked best was the conversion of a former mall into micro apartments with retail on the first floor. I have read about this and think it is brilliant marketing and a great way to use an abandoned building.There were so many great characters in this story and I can only see more depth to the characters to be developed over future books. Jade has trust issues but I think she learns to overcome them in this book. She has a fantastic grandmother that I think anyone would want to welcome into the family. And the story would not be complete without a handsome male that works his way through Jade's apprehension and into her heart.I can't wait to see what is next for this series (and I did see a bit of a preview at the end of this books)"}, {"userName": "Rosemary K", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5327299-rosemary-k", "userReview": "Kinsey Falls has so much to recommend it. It's a charming town filled with good people. Millie is a knockout character. Her rescue of a baby possum has far reaching consequences. When she takes her rescue to the pet store, she meets Caleb, a handsome and charming man. She knows that he would be perfect for her granddaughter, Jade. Her matchmaking ruffles Jade's feathers, but the more time she spends with Caleb the more she likes him. Their romance was so sweet. I loved this charming story. Gayle Leeson wrote characters that I cared for, realistic dialogue and the perfect setting. I'm looking forward to the next book in this new series.I received a copy of this book which I voluntarily read and reviewed. My comments are my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Barbara Hackel", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32992108-barbara-hackel", "userReview": "I found this book to be both humorous and intriguing. I kept trying to imagine having a grandmother that would rescue a baby possum, and in her next breath (well practically) start telling the pet shop clerk about her granddaughter. I would have died of embarrassment! But I loved the way Jade handled it, immediately imagining Caleb (the clerk) to be a con man! She was having no part of Caleb! Of course even Jade could be wrong about a few things.The premise of having young professionals and seniors housed in different wings of a dying mall was brilliant, and certainly offers many future opportunities for interesting storylines. The variety of small stores on the first floor of the mall also adds to the interest of the book and future stories. I liked the wide range of characters and the connection between them. When Jade's grandmother started exhibiting unusual behavior, she had her old friend and neighbor as well as her granddaughter, her granddaughter's business partner and best friend, and Caleb all concerned and checking on her. It was nice to see that a choice to move to this type of facility included keeping old friends (and new) close by.I am looking forward to more visits to Kinsey Falls and meeting new people along the way. I hope Millie, Jade, and Caleb are there as well."}, {"userName": "Eileen", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5685944-eileen", "userReview": "Hightail It to Kinsey Falls, book one in Gayle Leeson\u2019s Kinsey Falls series surprised me. It was not a mystery story as I expected from Ms. Leeson but rather a sweet contemporary romance. The town of Kinsey Falls built, or created, a mixed living building for seniors and the under thirty crowd living in opposite wings. On the main floor are shops and a common area for the residents to use. Jade operates a yarn and knitting store on the main floor while her grandmother lives in one of the apartments in the building. When Millie finds an abandoned baby possum, it leads her to meet Caleb, manager of a pet store. Caleb would be perfect for Jade and when she meets Caleb, it\u2019s hard to argue with her grandmother\u2019s choice. Still, Jade is determined to push Caleb away, but his friendship with Millie concerns her. Maybe he is a slick con man trying to take advantage of a sweet old lady. Jade needs to figure Caleb out before he breaks not only her grandmother\u2019s heart butd possibly hers too.Ms. Leeson wrote a wonderful story with relatable characters, humorous situations and even an occasional red herring was thrown in for fun. I really enjoy reading this book and had trouble putting it down, turning page after page, wanting more once I turn that last page. I highly recommend this series to other readers and look forward to her next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7345423-laura", "userReview": "I expected a mystery. I got a very enjoyable chick-lit read from author Gayle Leeson. Having read previous works by this author, I was thinking Hightail It would be a pet-based cosy mystery. It is instead women's fiction set in the assisted living retail community of the Kinsey Falls, VA community center. The community center is half shopping mall, half living apartments in the upper half and the upper floor is further divided into halves and one side has senior accommodations while the other side houses young professionals.Jade Burt does not live in but she does own a knitting business in the center. Her grandmother, Millie, does live in and meets Caleb the handsome pet store worker when she rescues an animal in danger. She immediately thinks he would be perfect for her granddaughter. Millie has never tried to set Jade up before and Jade has been recalcitrant to such treatment from her mother and leery of relationships in general because of a negative past experience. Can Jade open her mind enough to realise her grandmother has only the best of intentions and then open her heart to the possibly of a forever (or at least a for now) with Caleb? Take a road trip with me down to Virginia and find out!"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20678476-heather", "userReview": "I just finished \"Hightail It to Kinsey Falls\" by Gayle Leeson, and I already have decided to buy a copy for my niece.I am a fan of cozy mysteries so I wasn't sure what to expect from Gayle (Trent) Lesson here- but it is PERFECT for your summer tote bag!\"Hightail It\" reads much like a cozy mystery would, but instead focuses on relationships and intentions. I loved being introduced to Jade, her grandma, Millie, and their friends at Kinsey Falls and the downstairs shops. In this book, Jade wonders if handsome Caleb from Hightail It! Petstore is trying to con her grandma or if he truly is just a really personable grad student that just happens to be super handsome.We are also introduced to Greta who is Grandma Millie's friend and has a couple tricks up her sleeve when at first Jade writes her off as a little silly.

But there was no murder! Other than the absence of a killer, this was a wonderful little story that is the start to a hopefully wonderful little series. I loved the concept of the redeveloped shopping center to provide a community for seniors and young professionals both to live along with an upscale retail center. I did not love how it felt like the author was purposefully highlighting stereotypes for the two groups. It felt very forced. And while I believe her intent was to disprove the stereotypes by the end of the book, I wish she had left them out to begin with and focused more on creating the unique and interesting characters that fill Kinsey Falls.A copy of this book was provided by NetGalley and Grace Abraham Publishing in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27195030-jeanne", "userReview": "Hightail It to Kinsey Falls is the 1st book in the Kinsey Falls series by Gayle Leeson.I really enjoyed this and thought it was a great start to a new series. Millie is a hoot. I\u2019d love to have a neighbor like her. Terri, Jade, Greta, and Caleb were all likable characters and provided an enjoyable story with a healthy dose of humor and romance. The interactions between the seniors and the young professionals was a lot of fun and I think there is a lot to learn from each other while attending dance parties, playing bingo, etc. The premise of having seniors and young professionals residing in the same locale provides a lot of interesting opportunities for future books.
