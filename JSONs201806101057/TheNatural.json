Today I read Bernard Malamud's The Natural, which I rate 3.6 stars. I have seen the movie version of this book in which Robert Redford's character hits a game winning homer to clinch the pennant, shattering lights, creating his own fireworks, with memorable music in the background. The written version, unfortunately, is not as upbeat, and has a dark undertone to it. It begins the same as the movie as young Roy Hobbs is traveling to Chicago with his scout and mentor Sam Simpson to have a tryout with the Cubs. En route their train stops at a county fair and major league star The Whammer, resembling Babe Ruth, happens to be on the same train. A newspaperman challenges the two to a baseball duel, and Hobbs strikes out the Whammer on three pitches. A legend is born. Yet, in Chicago, a disturbed woman obsessed with striking down star athletes guns down Hobbs in her hotel room, and he disappears from organized baseball. Fast forward fifteen years, and Hobbs resurfaces as a thirty five year rookie on the New York Knights, albeit with a mysterious past that he wishes to keep secret. The book follows the same trajectory as the movie in that Bump Bailey is killed running into a wall, and Hobbs takes his place in the middle of the lineup. Immediately he starts hitting, and two women take notice: Memo, niece of Knights long suffering manager Pop Fisher and Iris, a black haired young grandmother in Chicago. The rest of the book includes Hobbs' internal battle as to which life course to follow and which woman he would rather be with, as much as his quest to give Pop Fisher the pennant and allow both men to end their careers on a positive note. Whereas the movie ended on the positive note and neatly tied up loose ends, the book's final scenes are dark and paint a picture of a flawed, fallen hero. We are left wondering if Roy chooses Iris or if he goes back to the shadows from whence he came never to play ball again. For those expecting the fireworks, they will be disappointed. I was left with a slightly bitter feel when I finished this classic. I rated it as high as I did because it does contain some fun baseball scenes as well as Malamud's prolific prose. I would still recommend this as a book that baseball fans should read in their lifetimes, yet it is one of those rare occasions where the movie is better than the book. A perfect read for baseball season, 3.6 stars."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Important book on baseball, rife with fun clich\u00e9s (essential to our nation nonetheless...?).

Like many books and films based upon the book, the two media are vastly different. This relationship reminds me of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? 3 and Bladerunner, two similar stories but essentially different and made so by the necessary distinctions of the enabling forum. Both are fine works, just very different. First of all, Malamud\u2019s vision is far darker than the Barry Levinson film and the book\u2019s Roy Hobbs is not at all the same character as the one Redford portrays. Malamud\u2019s Hobbs is the more human of the two, the cinematic version taking the noble, more palatable, almost fable like, but simpler and dimensionally pure but tragic hero. The Roy Hobbs from the book is more complex, as is the book itself. The reader should not look for easy and inspiring Hollywood clich\u00e9\u2019s, but the book is excellent in its own way. The author has created a mood, a dramatic tension that reminds me of Jack London\u2019s short story \u201cA Piece of Steak.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "A true slice of that American pie...or rather a slice of the true American pie (with a dusting of nuts on top)...(I mean \"crazy\" nuts)...(jesus, this metaphor is falling apart like a...like a bad analogy!). For the better part of the last hundred years, baseball has meant America. The Natural is about baseball, thus The Natural is about America. The American dream of working hard and making something of yourself is encapsulated herein. The protagonist, Roy Hobbs is a young baseball prospect with the world ahead of him. Malamud uses a train metaphor to show Hobbs' \"inevitable\" path to glory. Well that train gets derailed, the promising athletic career is sidetracked until it's almost too late, leaving Hobbs with only a fast-closing window of opportunity. That is a more realistic version of the dream. Some make it big, most fade away. Obviously there is a good deal of baseball-talk, so I'm not sure I'd recommend this to everyone. In that respect, for me it was nearly perfect. I love following sports, and if you pair that with a ripping yarn, I'm yours. Malamud put together a pretty good story. I was tempted to give it 4 stars, but instead I'm going with a really strong 3. There were a couple strange, almost nutty scenes that had me shaking my head and thinking the Three Stooges had just barged into this otherwise perfectly good book."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/394652-mandy", "userReview": "One of the most over-rated novels in all of American Literature. Malamud cannot write. Or he writes like a 13-year-old boy would write. It baffles me -- baffles me! -- why this book is considered a classic and why on earth we would teach it to high school students. It must be because it's about baseball. Big farkin' deal.

Ha una prosa nitida, di una agilit\u00e0 e di una eleganza che non fa intuire sforzi. Un talento naturale. Come quello di Roy Hobbs, che voleva diventare iI Migliore dei giocatori di baseball. Molti si lamentano del baseball, parlando di questo libro. Ma sbagliano. Non importa capirci niente di mazze e palle, in realt\u00e0, per starci dentro. E molti parlano di demolizione del Sogno Americano, quello per cui, se sei bravo e ce la metti tutta, l\u2019America ti d\u00e0 un\u2019opportunit\u00e0 e poi un\u2019altra e prima o poi ce la fai. Con Malamud non funziona mai cos\u00ec. E non per via che il Sogno Americano \u00e8 un imbroglio. Quello, se \u00e8 vero, viene dopo, \u00e8 un corollario. Non funziona cos\u00ec perche Malamud ha una visione tetra prima che pessimistica dell\u2019uomo in generale e della sua traiettoria di vita, ovunque si svolga: in uno shtetl o a Brooklyn, in una bottega o nella stadio pi\u00f9 importante del mondo. I suoi personaggi anche quando hanno un talento, come in questo caso, anche quando ci provano una prima volta e poi ci riprovano, come accade qui, si portano dentro una inguaribile insoddisfazione, una consapevolezza di vanit\u00e0 dello sforzo e una inconsapevole percezione che non andr\u00e0 bene, che qualcosa di malato dentro di loro o dentro la vita in quanto tale, prima o poi li porter\u00e0 a fallire. Parla di \u201cgente che nella vita, per una ragione o per l\u2019altra, viaggia sempre sugli stessi binari e non ottiene mai quello che vuole, qualunque cosa sia\u201d.Ci sono pagine e figure belle per davvero in questo romanzo: il giudice e in particolare il primo incontro di Roy con lui, per esempio. E lo sono anche certe annotazioni come l\u2019esaltazione del buio o come la figura di Memo Paris, la donna-emblema della infelicit\u00e0, senza nessuna consistenza di carattere, legata alle apparenze e al successo sociale eppure capace di esercitare un\u2019attrazione rovinosa: una sorta di trappola vivente. Pi\u00f9 che in altri romanzi poi, forse complessivamente migliori di questo, colpisce come anche nei momenti in cui le cose sembrano girare al meglio, in cui meriti, talento e fortuna sembrano finalmente allinearsi su una traiettoria di ascesa, di successo, riesca a far affiorare nel personaggio con un aggettivo, una divagazione descrittiva, una banale annotazione il marchio inconfondibile con cui riconosci tutti gli infelici. E cio\u00e8 la certezza che quella fortuna, ogni fortuna, \u00e8 un illusione e nasconde un inganno; che quella precaria felicit\u00e0 verr\u00e0 pagata a caro prezzo; e quel prezzo riporter\u00e0 le cose nella normalit\u00e0 riposante, perch\u00e9 in equilibrio col corso naturale delle cose, nell\u2019alveo della sofferenza. Se c\u2019\u00e8 un motto che potrebbe essere messo sotto la foto di tutti gli infelici e anche del Migliore \u00e8 questo: \u201cla felicit\u00e0 si paga a caro prezzo\u201d.Eppure, nonostante tutto questo, la conclusione del romanzo mi ha sorpreso. Non perch\u00e9 non mi aspettassi qualcosa del genere: conosco (e amo) Malamud. Oltre che sorpreso infatti sono ammirato dalla perfezione desolante del ghirigoro di trama che imbastisce nel finale, da grandissimo raccontatore di storie appunto, fino a farti perdere la bussola. E con quell\u2019arabesco che potrebbe portare dappertutto, raggiunge alla fine il punto esatto di esito possibile pi\u00f9 profondamente nero, oscuro, in cui nulla si salva e nulla si impara. In cui ci si arrende e basta."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david", "userReview": "I haven't seen the movie, but other reviewers mention that the movie is sparkling and upbeat, while the novel is rather dark. And that is true; this is not an altogether \"happy\" story. It seems like Roy Hobbs will be a fantastic pitcher, able to strike out batters without their even seeing the ball. But that is quickly cut short ... no, I am not going to spoil the story here. Roy Hobbs' career as a baseball player is shut down before it really gets started. And he does not return to the game for fifteen years, when most people consider players to be near the end of their career. He becomes a very talented baseball player, but not a superhuman one; he has his superstitions, and he undergoes slumps occasionally, and sometimes has to be kicked out of them. Hobbs does not make the best choices when it comes to women. He ignores the wonderful woman who is right under his nose, and goes for one who is simply wrong for him.Unlike his stories about Jewish life, here Bernard Malamud portrays a slice of middle America. The book portrays the baseball players, the club owner, the reporter, and the bookie with realism. I enjoyed the style, and sometimes felt myself wanting to yell, \"You dummy Roy! Do the right thing!\"I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook.

From the first line, I was impressed with the film noir-ish aspect and the dark heart of this American fable (overtly about baseball, but more honestly about mythic heroes). Roy is the golden hayseed, the boy from nowhere with a special baseball bat (kept in a bassoon case) called Wonderboy. He uses it just once - at a whistle stop carnival - while trying to impress a woman and accidentally kills Sam, the scout who discovered him. He then is lured to the hotel room of the mysterious Harriet Bird, who drops a black veil over her head and shoots him in the gut with a silver bullet. Good lord!Fast forward and now Hobbs is over 30 and \"too old\" for baseball's finest teams. Still, he hasn't lost his abilities and Wonderboy is still with him. He signs on to the most losing-est team in the league, the New York Knights, who have lost forty-five innings in a row. Hobbs replaces their star player, Bump Bailey, who dies from slamming himself into the back wall chasing down a ball. The Knights begin to win and win some more. And then they stop winning. Hobbs has lost his focus to a woman in a red dress......and then there's a woman in a white dress......and then the World Series is on the line. The end is nothing like the movie. It's hard not to like a book that features a man with a glass eye, a profane dwarf, and femme fatales who act as sirens to lure the hero away from his greatness. I could easily take umbrage at the sexism here, but I don't have the heart. The Natural is a surprisingly dark book about the creepy underside of our hero athletes."}, {"userName": "Carol Storm", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm", "userReview": "Gloomy and full of sadness, yet lacking any real lessons or even a real heart.What's striking about THE NATURAL is that critics love the IDEA of the book -- a Jewish-American writer certifies his \"American\" identity by writing the Great American Baseball Novel. Yet almost nobody who reads this book ever remembers any of the ball games -- or any of the characters -- or any American scenes or situations or dialogue. It's full of shadowy sureallism and all seems to be set in some twilight world devoid of real human interest, appetites, satisfactions, and needs.Roy Hobbes is not an All-American hero in this book. Nor is he a tragic hero. He's just a chump. He eats too much and gets sick to his stomach. He falls for a whore with a heart of ice who is hands-down the most offensive anti-woman stereotype I have ever read. He cares for nothing, learns nothing, and experiences no real change or growth at the end. As much as I respect the idea of tragedy, I can't pretend this book is the real article. And as much as I hate to admit it, golden boy Robert Redford actually improved on his source material, turning an unreadable piece of crap into a fairly entertaining family film. By the way, if you're looking for a great baseball novel by an \"important\" Jewish-American writer, THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL by Philip Roth is a much better book. None of the characters are especially sympathetic. But it's funnier, scarier, and far more attuned to the real issues in American life."}, {"userName": "bup", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup", "userReview": "I can't believe how little Malamud apparently knew baseball. I tried to understand this book three different ways - first, as a remarkable story set in the real world. NFW. Second, as a surreal fairy-tale/morality play, a la Coelho's The Alchemist. No, Malamud simply seems to believe what he wrote too much. I mean, there are obviously surreal elements, but Malamud didn't make the full commitment. It's just not that. Third, as a kid's book. Almost, until you get to the end. He really thought he had something powerful for adults.The book's just a mess. Malamud just doesn't understand baseball. Most of the book, at-bats go three pitches (leading me to think hey-maybe-it's-surreal. If I were to rewrite the book that's the direction I'd take. But I'd stick with it.) The titular Roy Hobbs has way too much control - fouling pitches where he wants them to go, consecutively.The plot emerges as organized as sputum, with plenty of metaphorical guns-hung-over-the-mantel* that get forgotten, and places where Roy does the right thing only to undo it. To his fault, Malamud used one historical incident where a player got shot by a crazy woman in a hotel room, but he uses it randomly, seemingly tacked onto the front of a story about something else. To his credit, Robert Redford took a novel called The Natural and used it randomly, making a good movie out of a couple of random pieces therein.People who like Jerry B. Jenkins' overt, confused moralizing might like this book. People who like those glurgy e-mails that seem to say something uplifting until you really think about it, might like this book.

I was recommended this classic by my father-in-law who recently found a collection of his work on a bookventure, and knows how much I love the game of baseball. As a boy, the movie about Roy Hobbs was a favorite and fantasy. I grew up in a rural town, and my father passed on his love of baseball to me before I knew how to walk and talk. I loved playing the game. My friends and I played it all the time in spring, summer, and fall. I was on multiple teams, and in my neighborhood, we actually built a baseball field in an open field. We were all 8 at the time, and I remember it clearly. A few adults took a liking to our inspiring work and helped us create a wall and delivered chalk for the lines. I'm getting off on memory lane, and away from this work and review. I loved the game. I adored the movie. It was a fairytale of a baseball movie. A boy from a rural town, discovered, and eventually getting his chance. He tore up the competition with the bat he made, Wonderboy. Oh, and the ending. It was a good film - made you feel good, and the character and story made you want to get out and play the game even more. I don't know how this book, the inspiration to the movie has just now entered my grasp, but I was very happy to spend a couple hours with this and see where the thoughts began . . . And oh, how it's different. Typical with the era this was written, this is a dark tale - written in a dark time. Baseball is a part of the story, but it's a backdrop to the themes focused by Malamud. Apparently, there were recurring themes in his work, and this one used baseball - the American pastime - to help tell his story of trying to obtain the American Dream. Roy Hobbs, in the eyes of Malamud, wasn't quite the fairytale character found in the movie. The Robert Redford classic took the namesake of the character, the era, and some of the journey, but they sure made it a lot happier. After reading this, I've come to the conclusion, I like my baseball tales a bit happier! This is one of those rare occurrences that I'll take the movie over the book. Now it could be me being disconnected to the struggles and dilemmas Malamud puts in his lead character, but the movie was a part of my life, and I sure did enjoy watching it! In this work, Hobbs seemingly makes wrong decision after wrong decision. The writing style of Malamud is difficult at times in reading this. It's written in a prose style at parts, and with such darkness in most characters, I found it to be a juxtaposition that was hard to get fully into and overcome. I will say that I love the character was to become in the movie version. For that, this was an enjoyable trip as a reader and one I'm happy to have taken."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52345804-karen", "userReview": "This is one of my all-time favorite books. I have gotten to teach it twice now, and each time I read it, I'm more and more impressed with Malamud's spot-on perspective on American heroes, the dreams we create for ourselves and how they change and diminish as we age, and the inevitable failure that we all have lurking inside of us. Despite the fact that Roy Hobbs is an utterly frustrating character -- does he ever make the right choice? -- it's hard to be too down on him because it's easy to see ourselves in his bad choices.

Bernard Malamud\u2019s 1952 novel about Roy Hobbs and his time playing for the New York Knights is considered to be a classic baseball fictional story and was also adapted onto film in the 1980\u2019s, with Robert Redford starring as Hobbs. I will add a disclaimer that I have never seen the film, so this review and the opinions within are based only on this book.I found Malamud\u2019s development of the main characters in the story very good, even though there wasn\u2019t a single character in the story that I could say I felt was a protagonist or a \u201cgood\u201d guy or lady. Hobbs has several character flaws which I believe portray him in a less-than-favorable light, such as always seeking out intimate relations with any woman with whom he is in contact. One of these women, Memo, was taking a fancy to a teammate of Hobbs who died on the baseball field, Bump Bailey. Bailey\u2019s untimely demise is the reason Hobbs became a started on the Knights and he immediately tries to court Memo, whose own character flaws are revealed later. About the only character who seems be able to evoke sympathy from a reader is Iris, and the reason she is initially not Hobb\u2019s type of lady is that she is a young grandmother. This doesn\u2019t sound like the typical baseball hero in a fictional story \u2013 but Roy and all the other main characters are well developed by Malamud. Maybe the reader won\u2019t like them, but the reader will believe that he or she knows them. The story moves along well both on and off the diamond. The baseball scenes are written well for the time depicted, which was when there was no night baseball and the game moved along at a quicker pace than today\u2019s sport with many pitching changes. There is one big leap of logic, however \u2013 how does Roy become such a great pitcher at 19 to strike out the mighty Whammer in a duel, yet later becomes such a great hitter and outfielder at 35?I must also mention one other character that is baseball-centric, Wonderboy. That is the name Roy has given to his bat, and he treats Wonderboy better than he treats the ladies, with special polishing and storing. If there is any character who deserved pity - even though this character is an object \u2013 it is the ultimate demise of Wonderboy. The fact that Roy made sure to bury Wonderboy on a baseball field says a lot about Roy\u2019s relationship with his favorite bat.The audio version of the book was narrated superbly by Christopher Hurt, who did his best to make the listener feel like he or she is on the field or in the hotel with Roy and company. While the ending is dark and leaves the reader feeling down, the book certainly does earn a place in the library of classic baseball novels. http://sportsbookguy.blogspot.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20159549-leslie", "userReview": "An interesting tale by a great writer. It's a first novel, much simpler than some of Malamud's other work, the dialogue a little awkward, but perhaps intentionally so. Do not read further if you don't like spoilers. It is hard to say anything about this novel without giving away pivotal events.****************************We first meet Roy Hobbs as a young prospect who is being taken by a down-on-his-luck scout to a tryout for a big league team. Fate intervenes, the scout dies, and Roy is very seriously wounded. His chances for a career in professional ball are completely derailed.We next see a much older Roy as he arrives in New York to join the Knights, a major league team that is down on its luck. Roy is a mysterious figure with a dark and passionate nature and almost unbelievable skill. There are intimations of magic, perhaps contained in the bat he uses (which Roy made himself as a young man), but nothing is explicit or amplified. Roy is a bundle of sensitivities and nerves and desires. There is nothing warm or sunny about him -- he is irritable and often antagonistic towards his teammates, the fans, and management. As he begins to contribute to the team, he resents his poor salary as he aspires to to court a woman with expensive tastes.Roy knows his age will limit the length of his career and his ability to cash in on his skill. He longs for the greatness he has always felt is in him, and wants to break every record so that he will be remembered as the greatest baseball player that ever lived. But in the end, hard living, age, and temptation catch up with Roy. His body broken, he realizes that the only way he can gain the riches he needs to win the woman of his dreams is to throw an important playoff game. Roy resolves to do so, but changes his mind as the game progresses. In his last at-bat, Roy tries to win the game, but fails. The end of the book beautifully evokes the Black Sox scandal and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson who was believed to have thrown (along with several of his teammates) the 1919 World Series. It's a strong finish to a book that occasionally meanders. Malamud seems to be suggesting that an athlete, being but a human being, can be simultaneously great and incredibly flawed. Cheating is eternal even while it takes different forms, whether it be athletes taking illegal substances to improve performance, or athletes intentionally underperforming.We are much more aware now of cheating as a part of the professional sports scene than when Malamud wrote this novel. Outstanding performance is now often greeted with suspicion as well as excitement. Roy brings to mind the many baseball greats that are currently under dark clouds, those formerly assumed \"first ballot Hall-of-Famers\" whose records are now tainted by substantial evidence concerning performance-enhancing drugs. Just as Roy did, those modern players tried to defy the ravages of age and biology to break records and achieve what others could not. Roy at least seems aware of what he has lost and his own responsibility in his tragedy, while many today's players seem not to have grappled with the meaning of their actions, whether it be their original transgressions or their vigourous denials after the fact."}, {"userName": "Will", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2263507-will", "userReview": "This book had its good points and its bad points, but in the end I felt underwhelmed. The movie left me feeling the same way, but at least that had Randy Newman's great score. The good:Malamud's writing can be humorous, at times even makes-you-chuckle-on-BART humorous. The introductory sequence with greenhorn Roy Hobbs on the train with the world-famous Whammer and pretty, mysterious Harriet Bird is unforgettable: evocative, inspiring and sad (those first 50 pages would have made a great short story on their own). For someone writing in the 50s, Malamud writes dream sequences that are admirably Freud-free and realistic. The book is also refreshingly straightforward and frank in its inclusion of sexual elements in the story. Also, this may be one of the few stories I've encountered, ever, where the drunkard character is not only sympathetic, but is in fact the only likable character. And then there are the food-porn passages: \"Memo kidded him about the way he wolfed the sandwiches, but she showed her affection by also serving him half a cold chicken which he picked to the bone. He demolished a large slab of chocolate cake and made a mental note for a hamburger or two before he went to bed.\"The bad:Malamud's writing is weirdly inconsistent, and during the parts that he fills with flowery descriptive prose, it can get so over-the-top that you want to throw up your hands and toss the damn book into the BART tracks. The bulk of the book, regarding bitter 35-year-old Roy Hobbs's return to baseball, has almost nothing to do with the beginning. (Parenthetical note: If 19-year-old Hobbs is such a crack pitcher, why does 35-year-old Hobbs only play outfield? If he's retained his fantastic batting prowess, wouldn't he have retained his considerable pitching prowess too?) At least half of the characters in the book have a common or proper noun as a first or last name: \"Memo Paris,\" \"Red Blow,\" \"Goodwill Banner,\" \"Max Mercy,\" and so on. I am told that this is a literary thing, and such names are symbolic, not merely annoying. I suppose that Malamud's world is one in which the majority of parents are clairvoyantly channeling Sarah Palin's unique genius for name-giving (see Track, Trig, Willow, et al.). And then, the drunkard character is only in the story for the first 50 pages, and virtually all the other characters are unlikable. Roy Hobbs in particular comes across as a pathetic, childish jerk. I frequently enjoy depressing books with flawed protagonists, so I'm not sure why the lack of likable characters made this one difficult to enjoy. Oh well."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "THE NATURAL. (1952). Bernard Malamud. *****.When I read this first novel by Malamud back in the late 1950s, I was blown away. On this second read, I was still mightily impressed. If you have not read any of Malamud\u2019s works, this should be first on your list. It was immediately classified as a \u2018baseball\u2019 novel, and, indeed, it is set in the baseball world. The hero. a natural ball player, is cut short in his career by a woman he totally mis-read, and had to defer his entry into the sport for several years. His basic problem was that he had little understanding of the world and how it worked outside of a ballpark. He was particularly inept in his choice of women. To say that he was na\u00efve would be an understatement. We do get to know our ball player very well, however, and soon learn that his simple beliefs in his forms of morality are etched on his soul. Don\u2019t be put off by the simplicity of the story; it is artfully constructed. I did learn that the basic premise of the plot was based on a true incident involving a player from the Philadelphia Phillies in 1949. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Steven Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson", "userReview": "Those who have seen the movie but have not read the book will be surprised. Bernard Malamud paints a much darker picture of the odyssey of Roy Hobbs. The book takes the arc of one person's career--Roy Hobbs--and weds it to a couple grim episodes in baseball's history: Eddie Waitkus and the Black Sox. The Hobbs of the novel is wonderfully talented--but very human. In the movie, there is a prolonged slump after Hobbs links up with Paris Memo. In the novel, he sometimes simply has a slump. In the novel, he appears to have supernatural powers; in the novel, he is very talented but very human. The movie's uplifting ending works. The novel's darker ending also works. Each version of \"The Natural\" works well in its own right; the momentum in each moves toward the closing. Malamud writes well and creates characters that seem to have life to them. He also captures the very human--and vulnerable--traits of the characters. Even if you liked the movie and its view of Roy Hobbs, you will find the book gripping in its own, very different way."}, {"userName": "Daisy ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1013908-daisy", "userReview": "I've never seen this movie.This book is vivid and summery. Full of baseball and its superstitions and lingo (I love the word \"stuff\" and what it means in baseball and I think nowadays it means even more). Malamud doesn't use contractions in his dialogue here so there's a '50s formality to the mood. Seems like all the men's names are one syllable and all the women's names are two. I like the name Memo for a character. Never heard that one before. Roy's appetite and all the food he consumes: some fun food listing--and Roy's downfall. The narrator is pleasant. Much more a reading tone than a performance.

A number of you may remember the 1984 movie starring Robert Redford. I haven't seen the movie but I sense the book is darker. The story begins with a young Roy Hobbs on a cross-country rail journey that recurs in dreams throughout the book as a symbol of futility. At one stop, he encounters The Whammer, a fading star who he strike out. He also encounters Harriet Bird who turns out to be a crazed serial killer of athletes, who nearly ends Hobbs's life in a Chicago hotel.Flash forward to Hobbs at 35, who finally makes it back to the majors landing a spot with the hapless New York Knights, their aging manager Pops, their star clown, Bump, his girlfriend Memo (where does he get these names?), the shrewd skinflint owner,Judge, the gambler, Gus, and the sportswriter, Max Mercy, who senses this is not the first time he has met Roy. Hobbs lands a spot, taking Bump's place after Bump died running into a wall chasing down a long fly ball. Roy, and his bat Wonderboy, help lift the club into first place. Hobbs tries to get Memo back in his bed (he had slept with her after trading rooms with Bump only to have her, thinking he was Bump, jump in bed with him).When he fails in his efforts, he ends up in a slump, only to meet the one woman who really cares about him, who he avoids after a one night stand finding out that she, though younger, is a grandmother. But she restores his self-confidence, the team gets into first place, and has to win one more game, which it fails to do because Hobbs voraciously eats himself sick. They are tied with the Pirates and have to win a playoff game to win the pennant. Hobbs is released in time for the game but offered a payoff if he will throw the game--a payoff allowing him to provide a life of style for Memo. Will he take the payoff, or remain loyal to the team and Pops.The quest for greatness, the voracious hunger, and the penchant for dangerous women suggest a man searching for significance in the face of onrushing death. He is the hubristic tragic hero. Yet all this seemed cliche, from the names, to the \"dangerous women\" to the language he uses to describe these women. Maybe this portrays his shallowness, but it seemed overdone and heavy-handed, which surprised me in a writer of Malamud's reputation.This is considered a baseball classic but I was disappointed. A bit more subtlety would have been welcome. From what I can tell, this was early Malamud and perhaps he was learning his craft. Whatever was the case, this is a classic I can't recommend, as pleasant as this might have been to read."}, {"userName": "Franky", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2534471-franky", "userReview": "Say it ain't so. I was aware of this novel for quite some time, as I saw the film years ago, but I never realized how far removed the book is from the 1984 film with Robert Redford. In my opinion, this is one of those rare cases where the film is volumes better than the book. I know that the author intended his book to have ties to mythology and the Arthurian legend, but, even at that, the way tries to incorporate the telling of Roy Hobbs\u2019 story into some sort of allegory is clunky and uneven at best. What we get is a superficial \u2013laden tale with various unsympathetic characters throughout. The odd thing about this book is that it doesn\u2019t succeed as an allegory or a realistic story. Even if the characters and situations are meant to be symbolic, there isn\u2019t enough emphasis to what the major theme of this book is, which is the downfall of a \u201csupposed\u201d tragic hero. Instead, there are some bizarre occurrences that just come out of nowhere and have little to do with any allegorical context or central theme. What I\u2019ve come to realize is that The Natural is less about baseball, more about human frailty, Roy Hobbs front and center as its poster child. With his aspirations to be the \u201cbest there ever was\u201d dashed with a bizarre incident that puts him out of baseball until his mid-30s, he returns to the New York Knights to try again.  However, once Hobbs gets to the try out, the novel really ventures off here into some wild fantastical allegory. Instead of actually trying to be a good ballplayer, Roy spends time chasing women around, whining to his coaches, constantly comparing himself to Bump, and demanding higher pay. In short, there really is nothing to Roy Hobbs: he\u2019s moody, shallow, uninspiring, and mostly a pathetic jerk. There are seldom moments of pathos or emotion to Hobbs\u2019 story of trying to make it in the big leagues, but these are fleeting and minimal. I think the author was trying way too hard to take this whole symbolic, Arthurian legend to a new level and it just came out a rather flat, superficial story I could care less about.People label this often \u201cthe best baseball story.\u201d I would beg to differ. If you want to read a much better book, I would suggest \u201cEight Men Out\u201d, which deals with Shoeless Joe and the Chicago White Sox (Black Sox) scandal of the 1919 World Series. I wavered between 2 and 3 stars, but I\u2019ll go with a very low 3. Also, on another note, I\u2019m not sure why this book gets labeled as young adult. I don\u2019t think it fits this genre at all, as much of the content is probably unsuitable for younger readers."}, {"userName": "Andrew P.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27873857-andrew-p", "userReview": "The Natural by Bernard Malamud is not the typical sports hero novel. The protagonist, Roy Hobbs, a talented baseball player being scouted by the Chicago Cubs, hits rock bottom after being shot in the stomach, possibly ending his baseball career. Fifteen years later, Roy returns to the game and joins the fictional New York Knights. He slowly works his way to becoming the baseball player he used to be, but never quite gets there. Roy has conflicts with many people, including love interests and team management, but primarily he has conflicts with himself. He allows his pride to affect his success. Roy is a complex character - at times the reader will pull for him and at others the reader will want to scream at him for making dumb mistakes. Malamud\u2019s writing is skillful. He uses clever symbolic names for other characters. For example, the player Bump Baily dies from a bump on the head, and sportswriter Max Mercy shows no mercy when writing stories. He weaves into the plot several allusions to baseball stories, including the conspiracy to throw the 1919 World Series.The Natural is a sports-drama with a little humor. It uses the themes of romance, sports, success, failure, and tragedy. The novel has a great storyline, a sort of rags to riches to rags tale, much like that of the Steve Martin movie \u201cThe Jerk.\u201d Above all, there is a lesson to be learned, one Roy realizes too late. As Iris Lemon tells him, \u201cWe have two lives, Roy, the life we learn with and the life we live with after that.\u201dI gave the book four stars because of its captivating storyline based on a sport I enjoy. I didn't give it the full five stars because the author tends to ramble sometimes, using long descriptive sentences that include several thoughts. Overall, it was well-written and interesting, and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "I mostly read this because I somehow had it in my mind that I was remiss in not having seen the movie starring Robert Redford, and since I like to read the book a movie is based on first, well. It had to be done. And it is done. Except now I don't want to watch the movie.Roy Hobbs is, as the title suggests, a natural in baseball. He goes around talking pretty big about how bad-ass he is and how badder-asser he will be once he makes the big time... and then he goes and gets all involved with some vagi-gi instead. That's what ya get for being all snooty about your skillz, boy. Ya shoulda kept your eye on the ball. (The one coming over the plate, and not one of the pair in your pants.)So it's a story about baseball and women and money and ego. It failed to keep my interest. I pictured Robert Redford in every scene of the book just because people talk about him anytime the book or movie comes up. I don't know that I even need to see the movie as his performance in my head was pretty good. (Said performance in my head really consisted of Redford as the Sundance Kid as a baseball player. Infinitely cooler than the real version I'm sure.)But the writing itself left a lot to be desired. Kevin Baker's introduction comments on the fact that there are no redeeming characters in this book, and that was pretty dead on. However, unlike Baker, I don't find that part of this book's charm. As I've complained before it's okay to have horrible characters that are difficult for a reader to connect with, so long as the writing is capable of making the reader care about the actual story. And I don't feel Malamud was able to do that. For that reason alone I have to stick with 2 stars for this one. And I just put the movie back towards probably the bottom of my Netflix queue."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6772017-robert", "userReview": "A great novel and perhaps the greatest baseball novel of all time, The Natural is not without its flaws. First and foremost is Roy Hobbs, our protagonist, and his lack of likable traits. Roy is stubborn, shallow, and selfish. Everyone and everything in his life seems to only serve the purpose of appeasing his voracious appetite. For what does he hunger? For greatness, on the surface. To be the best at what he does. To fulfill his potential. To have it all. I struggled at times to get behind the thirty-four year old rookie, the latest sensation to break onto the scene in the major leagues. We are supposed to feel for him as the victim of circumstance, his career postponed by a tragic event in the book's introductory chapter. But to truly join Roy's team, we need to see a little bit of good from him to counter the crummy things he does, the poor way he treats people, and the bitter loner attitude he portrays to the world. I often found myself frustrated with Roy when I felt I should feel sorry for him.Despite these problems, Malamud's poetic language and magical realism paint a vivid backdrop for Roy's saga. Pitchers and batters huff and puff like steam engines while the New York Knights run the basepaths like Mississippi steamboats. The team's reclusive owner sits in the darkness, the ash at the end of his cigar the only thing lighting the room. Roy's legendary bat Wonderboy exists as an entity of its own, its magic clearly understood by the characters but never fully acknowledged. It's a tremendous conceit and goes well with a number of story elements seemingly beyond the realm of reality yet accepted by the story's universe as 'just there.'There's a lot of great stuff about heroes, manhood, retribution and fulfilling one's destiny in The Natural, and it's a pleasant, vibrant read for most of its 215 pages."}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/267933-grace", "userReview": "What an interesting book! It took so many unexpected twists. It was about so much more than baseball - as many baseball books are - but it was also less about baseball than I had expected, less about baseball than you think. Also, what is it about baseball and magic? This book is \"realistic\" except for the bat, Wonderboy. Baseball books seem to me, more and more, to have a special affinity for magic realism, highlighting this idea that some of the things that happen in the game are so unlikely that they can only be explained by magic. The way the bat is personified, they way it moves and seeks and searches, is not the way inanimate objects usually work. It makes me wonder about baseball books as magic realism - to some extent they seem to have this trait often. The ending was not what I expected. The characters were not what I expected. How nice that some things weren't explained - it seems in contemporary literature that everything needs to be unpacked. This book went more for a \"life is unpredictable\" approach and reflected that in the writing. The way characters pop up and take unexpected turns... Really interesting. And somehow it stayed away from being moralistic.And the language! The rich, slang-y, creative, unique, verbal language of this book is wonderful. The characters talk like working-class heroes, which in a way they are, and it's full of weird turns of speech and all-but-forgotten baseball jargon. This is definitely a book I'll be thinking about for a long time."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1434192-andy", "userReview": "The Natural has always been one of my favorite baseball movies, and I decided to finally read the book, with the season opening and all. I've read some reviews of people saying that the book is much darker than the movie, and... it's true. Although that is not really a bad thing. Roy is gruffer, grittier, and a little bigger than what Redford puts on the screen. He's also a bit nastier in terms of personality... not nearly as affable as Redford's Roy. Again, not a bad thing. The highs in the book are high and get your blood pumping and adrenaline going, and the lows are low... so low you don't want to know whether or not they're actually happening, and again, this is a good thing. The Natural is a classically brilliant book. The characters, the descriptive, the language, everything about it rings out mid- 20th American Lit, and I love that about this book.
