The plot kept moving and was believable. I enjoyed getting a glimpse into so many different lives. So sad that the book centers around Mara's suicide but it delves into how one tragic act can bring so many people closer together and change lives forever. I also enjoyed seeing Paige enrich her quiet life by bringing so many people and a kitten into her life. I also thought it was great how Peter, the \"playboy\" fell in love with Kate Ann, the town recluse-maybe a little too \"perfect\" how they fell in love, but sweet. Good, relaxing read."}, {"userName": "Rena McClain", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7125830-rena-mcclain", "userReview": "I listened to this book via Audible.I have enjoyed the Barbara Delinsky books I have read but this one was so slow, so predictable. From the start the plot was thin and easy to anticipate what was going to happen. It left little to the imagination or anticipation as the book went along.As for the reader, the delivery was awkward with very long, too long, pauses. Also, the reader had a very limited range of voices for the characters which made the book read more difficult to enjoy. Overall I just finished listening to be done with the book as the ending was totally predictable.Could I recommend this book/reader? No on both counts."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3682569-elizabeth", "userReview": "Each member of a medical clinical of 4 pediatricians is adversely affected when one of the partners commits suicide. No one can comprehend why a young women who was so successful in her practice and looking forward to the arrival of a baby girl from India would choose suicide. Some wonder if she really committed suicide.The one part of the story that wasn't very realistic in my mind was the foster placement, and later adoption, of the baby girl by the dead woman's best friend, Paige. I've gone through international adoption twice. In the story a caseworker shows up at night knocking on the door of Paige because she hasn't been able to get hold of Mara, the woman adopting the baby from India. The reason she can't get hold of Mara is because she is dead. Mara was expecting the baby to arrive sometime in the next few weeks. When Paige tells the caseworker this, the baby is left with Paige after a few phone calls to the agency. Paige agrees to provide foster care until another home can be found for the baby. This just would not happen in real adoption life.Also part of the story is the private boarding school in the town, and its new headmaster, brought on board to change the atmosphere of the school where partying and ignoring rules has led to poor educational performance and the dislike of the students by the community. Paige is the coach for the girls' track team.All in all this was a good book with interesting characters and a good story that kept me interested."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "Another great read by Delinsky!!\"In the idyllic small town of Tucker, Vermont, life flows at a rhythmic pace for pediatrician Paige Pfeiffer.

Reminded me a bit of More Than Friends or Shades of Grace. But I will say that there were far too many sex scenes for my liking. To begin with there were just a couple so I didn't mind so much, but towards the end of the book, I swear, there were two sex scenes in three chapters! I just got fed up with it and wanted to go back to the main plot. Plus some of the descriptions in these scenes were so cheesy and awkward - I won't quote here, so you'll have to trust me on that one! I think there were at least five or six scenes in total in this book and some of them could definitely have been cut out, especially when the plot was heating up and then we had to skip back to lovemaking. Her more recent novels are more subtle than this. I will say that I enjoyed reading about how each member of Mara's practice coped in the wake of her death. I didn't like Peter to begin with but he grew on me as the story developed. Angie seemed more distant than the others but I did find myself getting quite engaged in the way that she dealt with her problems. And, of course, Paige, who I wanted to shake sometimes for not seeing the great opportunities that had just been laid right in front of her! One of Delinsky's best skills is creating believable locations, and I really got a feel for Tucker, Vermont, particularly the boarding school where Paige worked as a running coach. I think this location particularly struck me as I live in a town that contains a private boarding school, and it was interesting to listen to this audiobook as I passed our local school on my way in and out of town every day. I guess it just made Tucker and its inhabitants seem more real to me. I like the way that the mystery about Mara's death unfolded, but as with all of Delinsky's novels, the event that occurs at the start fo the book isn't actually what the novel is really about. Mara's death was the catalyst for Paige, Peter and Angie rethinking their lives and making new discoveries and changes. That said, I did enjoy learning about Mara, and looked forwarding to hearing more of her hidden letters. Overall, a very compelling story that was really just let down by the excessive sex scenes, particularly one very tasteless one that probably couldn't be allowed to be included in romance novels written nowadays - it almost seemed like a rape scene, to be honest. An interesting mixture of romance and women's fiction. Not one of Delinsky's best novels, but definitely what I'd consider to be a \"standard Delinsky\". I'm not sure if I would have appreciated this book so much if I hadn't been introduced to Delinsky first with some of her later novels, as her books from the early 90s are riddled with graphic sex scenes, but I really did enjoy this story. Maybe not the best book to start with, but this is one of my forays into her back-catalogue that I haven't regretted. 3.5*"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "In the idyllic little town of Tucker, Vermont, life flows at a slower pace for everyone. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the lives of thirty-nine-year-old pediatrician Paige Pfeiffer and her colleagues. However when Mara O'Neill, Paige's medical partner and best friend since college, inexplicably takes her own life, the consequences of that one irrevocable act shatters Paige's peaceful life, and throws the lives of the three other doctors who practiced with her into absolute chaos. For Angie Bigelow, grieving Mara's death becomes the final straw in the disintegration of her once well-organized - and ostensibly happy - home and marriage. Peter Grace, whose relationship with Mara was much more complicated than he admits publicly, is left with a sense of desolation at her death. He has difficulty coping with his feelings of grief and feels a growing discontentment with life; a feeling which has its roots in his youth. Paige deals with her own feelings of loss and deep sadness by temporarily caring for Mara's newly-adopted baby daughter. As she slowly comes to terms with her grief, Paige clings to the hope that, in due time, she'll understand why Mara chose to end her life. And that her orderly life will eventually return. What Paige hadn't counted on were the unexpected pleasures that often come with change. In the wake of such a tragedy, Paige never realized that she would ultimately discover true meaning and purpose in her own life; including the touch of a man who offers Paige things she never thought she wanted. But before she can allow herself to fully embrace a future she never imagined, Paige must let go of the past and learn to trust her new found happiness. Overall, I very much enjoyed reading this book. It was a relatively quick read for me, and was very well-written. The story featured a wide variety of well-developed characters, and was written with a true understanding of the complexities of human nature and the intricacies of relationships. This wasn't necessarily my favorite book by Barbara Delinsky, but it certainly was well worth reading anyway.

Who doesn't have a friend who goes around and around an issue never realizing they have the power to make a different decision. The fact that these characters are financially well off and well educated may make their problems seem less real but the dynamics are real. We'd like to think that in real life we are not that dense but then again.Another factor about the articulations is even though they are so well done and cogent, the author lets you know that the characters know that thinking clearly is not the only action that needs to happen.

It makes each of the other 3 pediatricians look at their own lives more seriously, outside of their practice and decide for themselves what is really important in life insofar as their careers, goals and personal domestic lives.Very, very good. It makes one see that even a \"bad thing\" can turn out to be good or better for those left behind. Very moving."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/896399-jeanne", "userReview": "I reserved this book from the library, thinking from the 2008 publication date that it was a new novel from Barbara Delinsky. I realized before I began reading that it was a reissue of a 1994 book. Because of this, I wasn't expecting a lot. I was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of the characters and the story. It is also a pretty good romance. Some authors who began in the romance genre and then succeed in mainstream fiction lose much of the romance in their work. I had not particularly liked the most recent novel by this author, but I thought Suddenly showed her true talent. She remains one of my favorite authors."}, {"userName": "Jade Lawrence-Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44418944-jade-lawrence-smith", "userReview": "I loved the book. I like small town stories, I liked how Paige understood there were no perfect people in the end. She thought very high of her best friend in the beginning and was utterly disillusioned with her in the end. I think the message here is to understand that no one is perfect and that we need to cease idolizing our friends, even if they do seem to have it all. Sometimes, they are more confused than we are, even if they play perfect. This stops us from realizing our own potential, which may be greater than our friends'."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3727587-barbara", "userReview": "Three doctors share a pediatrics practice in Tucker, Vermont. When one of them suddenly commits suicide for no apparent reason, it becomes a catalyst for how the other three reevaluate their lives. I could quickly tell that this was an earlier work than other Delinsky novels that I'd read: there were quite a few awkward & unnecessary love making scenes that we don't find in later novels & the story was slow in some spots. Overall, her characters were well-written and likeable - with the exception of Peter. I'm still not sure if I believe/like his progression."}, {"userName": "Brandy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7536014-brandy", "userReview": "This is a first by this author and had me sucked in every second. I read it in 1 day. I had a hard time at first getting used to her style of writing but that is normal for me. The characters were well thought out and I liked how each character was given equal time. I also liked how Mara's death was in the first couple of pages and you never knew her but came to know her just as well through everyone else and her letters. The book wa a little predictable and hte conversations long but I guess that is realistic."}], "description": "This explosive new novel from the author of the New York Times bestseller More Than Friends is a provocative and emotionally charged story readers will not be able to put down.
