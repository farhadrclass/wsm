Obtain a copy of Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe.2. Read the book.3. Fall in love. Fall in love with the writing, the characters, everything. Read past midnight, read in school, read everywhere and all the time. Slam the book shut and whisper-scream oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. At the end of the book, allow a single tear to run down your right cheek and say a silent prayer of thanks for the fact that you are able to read at all.Perhaps I\u2019m making this book seem more dramatic than it actually is. It\u2019s not dramatic at all, in the typical sense. There are no overtly sentimental Nicholas Sparks plot twists, no super sexy erotica Fifty Shades of Grey style, not even an ardent declaration of love via Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice. This book is about two Mexican-American teens trying to find their way in the world, but before they do that, they find each other \u2013 Aristotle and Dante, the former a self-doubting silent guy, the latter an expressive, fair skinned swimmer. We experience the story from Ari\u2019s perspective, from the first time he met Dante at his local swimming pool.I\u2019d never really been very close to other people. I was pretty much a loner. I\u2019d played basketball and baseball and done the Cub Scout thing, tried the Boy Scout thing \u2013 but I always kept my distance from the other boys. I never felt like I was a part of their world.Throughout the book, Aristotle and Dante are exposed and layered, continually growing more complex but also becoming more bare. Their coming of age story is shown beautifully. What seems like a simple story about friendship is a simple story about friendship, but there are profound themes woven in and the quality of the characterization is simply breathtaking. Dante, a lover of poetry and a passionate crier, reminded me of myself so much it hurt, while every ounce of Aristotle\u2019s emotions \u2013 his confusion, his longing, his hate \u2013 resonated with me.I sometimes think that I don\u2019t let myself know what I\u2019m really thinking about. That doesn\u2019t make much sense but it makes sense to me. I have this idea that the reason we have dreams is that we\u2019re thinking about things we don\u2019t know we\u2019re thinking about \u2013 and those things, well, they sneak out of us in our dreams. Maybe we\u2019re like tires with too much air in them. The air has to leak out. That\u2019s what dreams are.Benjamin Alire Saenz has poetic prose. There aren\u2019t many compound sentences or large SAT words in this book, but every word impacted me. Sometimes the shortest sentence flooded me with feeling. Every description of Dante\u2019s laugh, every time the boys would call each other weird, every moment they spent together \u2013 it felt like I was there, experiencing their friendship and their bond.Have you ever heard that saying, if there\u2019s a book you want to read but it\u2019s not published, write it yourself? I won\u2019t stop writing, but Saenz has accomplished that for me here. Saenz dedicates this book \u201cto all the boys who\u2019ve had to learn to play by different rules.\u201d As a homosexual Asian-American living in Virginia, I\u2019ve had to learn to play by the rules of my parents, my society, and most importantly, myself. Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe will speak to Mexican-Americans, homosexuals, tom-girls, book nerds, loners, etc. Essentially, it will appeal to everyone who\u2019s ever felt different, who\u2019s ever felt like they weren\u2019t sure of who they were. Highly recommended for all."}, {"userName": "Rick Riordan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25375513-rick-riordan", "userReview": "YA realistic fiction.This book has won so many awards I could barely see the cover under all the stickers! After reading it, I understood why it gets so much praise. S\u00e1enz tells the story of two young men, Aristotle \u201cAri\u201d Mendoza and Dante Quintana growing up in El Paso, Texas during the 1980s. We follow their lives from age fifteen to seventeen, watching their relationship slowly grow, change and strengthen. Told from Ari\u2019s point of view, the novel is crafted in short, lyrical chapters. The prose sings. The dialogue is pitch-perfect. The story is quiet and gentle, but it pulls the reader through the narrative beautifully.Ari has loving parents, though his father silently bears the traumas of the Vietnam War, keeping him distant from his son. Ari\u2019s sisters are a generation older, making him feel like the family mascot rather than an equal sibling. Most troubling of all, the family has erased all traces of Ari\u2019s older brother, whom he barely remembers, who went to prison for a violent crime. Ari longs to know more and feels betrayed by his parents\u2019 silence. Overall, Ari feels like his life \u201cis a story written by someone else,\u201d a sentiment I suspect many teens can relate to.Ari has no real friends, nor does he want any, but in the summer of his fifteen year he meets Dante at the swimming pool, and Dante offers to teach him how to swim. They bond initially over their unusual names, but soon they are spending the bulk of their time together. We follow them through funny episodes, horrific accidents and tragic losses, watching their awkward and tentative friendship turn into the sort of bond that will challenge what Ari believes about himself and his capacity for love.I won\u2019t give away the ending, but I kept thinking about it long after I finished the book. It didn\u2019t end the way I expected it to, perhaps because of my own point-of-view and life experience, but I now see it ended the only way it could, as Ari learns how to reject the story others have written for him and write his life himself. This would be a great book club choice to spur discussions about identity and acceptance. Highly recommended.

Not a main story or event that the characters center around. It's about a boy. It's a story about a boy who is sad and angry and can't figure out why. It's about him trying to love himself and others. It's about the teenage condition and mentality.Let's talk about why I loved it. Mainly, I loved the mood and tone. It made me feel mellow and warm. I liked that it was slow paced, that it felt like real life with small but important events happening. I actually really liked Aristotle, the main character, even though he's kind of a jerk. But the thing is he doesn't want to be a jerk. I loved the relationships, especially with his best friend, Dante. It was real friendship, not false or easy. I loved the emphasis on family. And the ending was beautiful. So beautiful. I really related to the main character, his struggles of culture and feeling lonely and regretting growing up. And when I didn't relate to him I still empathized. I just wanted to hug Aristotle.I didn't realize how much I loved this book until it ended. I flew through it so quickly that I didn't realize how beautiful it was, how happy it made me feel. This is absolutely a new favourite. I can't wait to reread it."}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING"}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "\u201cThe summer sun was not meant for boys like me. Boys like me belonged to the rain.\u201dI've heard so many good things about this novel and seen it all over Tumblr. I wanted to read this so badly, which is why I finally, finally got my hands on a copy and started reading right away. I also finished reading it right away.My thoughts:Well, first of all, I love the way I can identify with Ari and Dante, but especially with Ari. Sometimes his stubbornness got on my nerves and I wanted to shake him and tell him that he should just go and love Dante. But on the other hand, everything just felt so real.Which leads me to my second point about how I kept on reading and nodding my head, smiling about how true some statements and feelings pictured in the novel felt. The thing is, S\u00e1enz does not try to be philosophical and poetic. He doesn't have to.Third, you can see how Ari grows. In the beginning, he is a 15-year-old boy, he talks like a 15-year-old boy, he thinks like one. But as he grows older he learns and experiences things, especially through Dante, he changes. I just want to state that this novel is a perfect example of character development.What bothered me (just a little), is the ending. Yes, it's happy and lovely and that's what I wished for but I had the feeling that everything went too fast. Particularly the revelations about the past.And also I am kind of angry. Why, whywhywhy couldn't we read more about their happy ever after? I mean, I've been waiting for this the whole time and now I don't even get two whole pages of Ari&Dante as a couple! Not fair. I want - need - a sequel!Reread:I'm still very much in love with this book. There may have been something in my eyes, they got a little teary.Update:We're getting a sequel.

I liked the narrator. Aristotle-nicknamed Ari-is a calm fifteen-year-old boy who prefers being alone...He doesn\u2019t feel comfortable being around people his age but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s a recluse. Everyone things he\u2019s sad and lonely but, really, he doesn\u2019t mind it.And then he meets Dante. Dante who made him see the world differently. Gosh, how much I loved that character. Everything about him made me think of an angel, a sweet sweet angel. I wish the world was filled with more people like Dante because this world would have been a much lovelier place.This is really a coming of age YA novel. Even though it\u2019s shelved as LGBT (which IS true and shelved it myself as it too), there is a good part of this story where it doesn\u2019t feel that way. It\u2019s mostly about friendship, family, trust, loyalty and being honest to ourselves and who we truly are. Then, comes the LGBT part and romance as well. I have to say that I throughout the story craved to see some romantic affection between Ari and Dante. There aren\u2019t many scenes at all that show some, because Ari isn\u2019t gay\u2026Or is he?I kept wondering while reading and felt like I knew, right inside me, the answer, except that I never could have been one hundred percent sure. Gladly, we do get an answer. Actually, every answer I could have had regarding events, characters and scenes were answered and that is a big plus to the book.The writing, at first, didn\u2019t quite work for me to be honest. It\u2019s a very simple style. The kind I could write myself without any problem. EXCEPT, we could actually feel as if it were really Ari\u2019s writing and that is an exceptional thing and very a witty way of writing a story when I think of it. I do admit that sometimes I really wished we had Dante\u2019s POV, just to know how he thinks and what\u2019s in his mind. Wait, I do know what-or who should I say-he\u2019s always thinking of. I just think at least one scene would have been so spectacular to have narrated by him.It\u2019s weird because Ari has sisters (and a brother) but we never actually really got to meet them or get to know those sisters. I don\u2019t even remember his sisters\u2019 names, if the narrator even told us their names in the first place. Shame because I really wanted to get to know them.I\u2019m so glad this story includes an animal, being the animal lover that I am. I feel like they usually bring a nice atmosphere inside a story and this one-a dog-sure did.Also, you need to know that this is a sad story. I mean, sure, there are many cute and happy moments, but drama usually follows. Plus, with that kind of atmosphere, how could I have held back my tears? Do I recommend this book?

Just waiting for the right moment for us to come together and love one another. And this book is fine, I guess. It's okay. But I really don't see the magic that prompted so many five star ratings and literary awards. It's weird because I was sure we were meant for each other. A Printz Honor book featuring a gay romance between two quirky characters - one of whom is a rough guy who gets into fights and has a complicated relationship with his father; the other being a sweet and sensitive boy who loves his poetry. Throw in some philosophical musings and a generous helping of poetic teen angst and you should be serving up a new favourite of mine, right?Apparently not.I love deep, complex and emotional contemporary YA that reminds me why I still read books aimed at teens. But, you know, I just didn't find this book as deep and meaningful as it was obviously trying to be. There were some intriguing passages thrown in that were clearly meant to tickle our inner emos, like:\n\n\u201cThe problem with my life was that it was someone else\u2019s idea.\u201d\n\nAnd:\n\n\u201cI wondered what it was we were laughing about. Was it just our names? Were we laughing because we were relieved? Were we happy? Laughter was another one of life\u2019s mysteries.\u201d\n\nBut it all felt like a good old example of trying too hard. The characters of Aristotle and Dante are two very different individuals who form an instant connection and go on to become close friends, but they never seemed like anything but caricatures of angsty teens with the pretentious poetry reading and frequent philosophical phrases that made me cringe. The dialogue was particularly unrealistic. There are some writers who can pull off floaty poetic speech between their characters, and then there are those who fail to sound more than fake, overdone and scripted. In my opinion, this book was in the latter category. However, I feel this way about John Green and everyone seems to love him too, so it's hardly surprising that I once again find myself in the minority.Not only does the constant waxing poetic feel a bit off, but the rest of the time we're treated to a choppy, fragmented narrative that gave me flashbacks to The Perks of Being a Wallflower. For example:\n\n\u201cWhen I got home, I sat on my front porch.I watched the sun set.I felt alone, but not in a bad way. I really liked being alone. Maybe I liked it too much. Maybe my father was like that too.I thought of Dante and wondered about him.\u201d\n\nI think I get what this book was trying to do and I also get what many people probably thought it was doing... but I can point you towards authors who do a similar kind of thing and make it seem less cheesy and far more real and meaningful: A.S.King, Melina Marchetta, Matthew Quick and Sara Zarr, to name but a few. When compared to the works of those authors, these characters and this writing just pale in comparison. In my opinion, anyway.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[ari never comes out, in the traditional sense. no, he is sat down by his mother and father who basically inform him that he is gay and in love with dante. which, for someone so closed-off emotionally, makes a little bit of sense, but is very clumsy narratively-speaking. it takes away the opportunity for character-growth, basically, and the revelation lacks any impact it could have had if ari had come to that conclusion himself. it's a little uncomfortable, actually; what teenager likes being told what to do by their parents, let alone being told to whom or to what gender they are attracted?? and since this takes place in 1987 with a mexican-american family, it seems way more progressive than should be expected. while i very much appreciate the novelty of ari as a gay protagonist , the \"not every gay male is emotional or theatrical or even, frankly, likable,\" i think it would have been a stronger scene if he had discovered this about himself, instead of just being coaxed into it.

Not because I didn't want to write it - I did. Believe me, I've worked this draft over and over like it's my magnum opus. I just wanted to get this review right, and to really communicate exactly how much this book means to me. I failed, but I did my best. This review is going to be grossly personal, because this book meant so much to me personally. To me it wasn't just a cute book or a fun read - it felt like someone had gone into my brain and tore out all the thoughts and feelings I didn't want everyone else to know about. This is many, many gay ya readers favourite book and it is so easy to get why.\n\u201cWords were different when they lived inside of you.\u201d\nIt was after reading this quote at 1.06am on a saturday night I started to cry - I know because I have a snapchat photo of me crying about this book which is timestamped. Anyway, the reason this is the line that earned my very rare book tears because I related to it so hard, because this line had summarised in 9 words all the tumbling turning thoughts I had about being out to myself in my head and not to the world. \n\"I guess I'm going to tell my dad. I have this little speech. It starts something like this. Dad, I have something to say. I like boys. Don't hate me. Please don't hate me, don't hate me don't hate me.\"\nAnother line that earned a giant sob from me. It was amazing how Benjamin Alire Saenz was able to pinpoint some of the exact thoughts and feelings about living closeted and considering coming out. I truly don't think you can understand unless you've experienced it or are experiencing it what it's like, and its impossible for me to explain, but this book got about as close as you can get to putting it into words. And Aristotle and Dante as characters are incredibly sympathetic and complex and their pain is mine too. This is probably the book I am most protective over because it meant so much to me and people bash Ari all the time just because they didn't understand him. These characters struggle with so much, internalised-homophobia, shame, deep-rooted social stigma and violent homophobia and yet they rise, and they are so brave. Aristotle comes to terms with his own internalised homophobia, and not only that he conquers it. Dante deals with so much violence and hate but he's so strong and he never backs down and I love him for that. I hate that people make this book about Ari and Dante relationship as a couple and don't think about their growth as people - or their deep friendship that was already a relationship before the final pages. Their relationship is important, and trust me I adore those final few pages - but what I also liked was how realistic this was, how it looked properly at why gay teenagers, especially boys, are struggling and why homophobia is still so persistent. \n\nSo here is the crux of this review: this is one of those books I can say is for us gay kids.Sure, you can read it if you're straight and you can enjoy it ect ect but this is one of those books that so truly captured my experiences and thoughts and I justdon't think you can get it if you've not experienced the same It breaks my heart, it is so painful and raw and true. But it also makes me so happy, because it's so hopeful and honest and brave and I have such a deep admiration for Benjamin Alire Saenz too, because I know how he's struggled too. I genuinely don't think I could ever give this book justice in a review - characters and everything else aside the writing is gorgeous - stunning. Truly one of the most beautiful and poetic books, and I think the book I have saved the most quotes from. Every word was a blow, some really really hurt - but some gave me relief. It is an intense and indescribable relief to have something you've been feeling but couldn't really put into thoughts written down in hard words right in front of you. (by junknight on tumblr)Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe changed my life, I deadass am not joking when I say this. I don't think any book has as accurately depicted how I was feeling. Few books have ever truly moved me, or made me cry. I can count the ones that have on my hand. Ari and Dante is one of them, it's so incredibly poignant and beautiful and raw it's impossible not to be taken on a wild emotional ride. It truly plays with your heart, and delivers lessons which are inspiring and hurtful. It was like having all my pain laid down at my feet. But reading this was also such a catharsis, like for 300 pages all the pain and confusion was sucked out of me and finally here was an author and here were two characters who got me, and accepted me, and understood.I don't just enjoy this book, I am so grateful for it. It changed my life, truly. It is a masterpiece and no review I could ever write would do it justice. But please know I do love it, so so much. \n\u201cI wanted to tell them that I'd never had a friend, not ever, not a real one. Until Dante. I wanted to tell them that I never knew that people like Dante existed in the world, people who looked at the stars, and knew the mysteries of water, and knew enough to know that birds belonged to the heavens and weren't meant to be shot down from their graceful flights by mean and stupid boys. I wanted to tell them that he had changed my life and that I would never be the same, not ever. And that somehow it felt like it was Dante who had saved my life and not the other way around. I wanted to tell them that he was the first human being aside from my mother who had ever made me want to talk about the things that scared me. I wanted to tell them so many things and yet I didn't have the words.

I'm just gonna say this: Aristotle and Dante become really good friends who end up doing things none expected to do together and just want to discover the hidden secrets of the universe. That's really it.Like I said, there was no plot. It was hard going into this book and reading every single word and just telling myself \"something is gonna happen\" when really, nothing exciting did. I understand there is a message behind this, I do, but that wasn't the whole problem with this. It really depends on the reader and how he or she takes the book, reads it, and reacts to everything happening. A lot happened, yes, but there was still no plot. The book was going from one place to another and it was confusing to follow along at times and that's why it can be hard for the reader to understand what the book really is about. Dante and Ari were characters that one can enjoy reading about, maybe even relatable to some, but there was still nothing that was even interesting about either one.One thing I completely loved about this was the relationship between Dante and Ari. They were such different characters but they managed to get along and just share a lot in common. Both were frustrating, but I've always been a fan of characters that are so different from each other and manage to grow up and like each other. I've always been a fan of characters who have such different personalities and attitudes but blend in such beautiful ways with each other because they're different. Ari and Dante were cute together, they're both cute, and the ending was even bittersweet. They didn't see each other for quite some time but still understood each other, looked out for each other, and were there for each other. They aren't one of my favorite couples, I will admit, but they were still without a doubt really cute. They didn't do many things that couples do because they were afraid to admit that they loved each other, but they still found each other. They didn't find the secrets, after all, they couldn't, but they had found each other and found each other's hidden secrets. Hidden paths. Hidden messages. Hidden light. I must say, the only reason I completely dived into this one was because of the author himself. Benjamin was born in New Mexico in a city I haven't heard of but a state I live in. I was born in New Mexico, Santa Fe, NM, and finally reading a book written by an author that was born here is really really refreshing. You always get these authors and writers and artists born in the most popular or common states like California, Florida, hell even Texas, but never New Mexico. I mean, Demi Lovato was born in Albuquerque and when she came here for a concert, she treated her fans differently even when she was \"home\" and barely even mentioned Albuquerque. What I mean by different isn't the good different, it's the bad one. You couldn't hug her? HAHAHA, WHAT?? Yeah well, I couldn't, at least. New Mexico sucks y'all, don't move here. We got green chili and that's about it. Other than that we got a shit load of dirt and no grass. We don't have any trees. We don't have plants. We don't have nice pastures. All we got is sand, dirt, chili, mountains, and a shitty bipolar weather that fits with my personality.What else is there to say about this? The characters were relatable, especially Ari. He was miserable, a teen who was miserable and was still finding himself. I'm a teen, I'm sixteen, and I'm still trying to find myself. Some look at me like I have everything planned out for my future, what I want to do and become, where I wanna go. Yes, I have plans, but that doesn't mean those plans are actually gonna happen and work out. I wanna first graduate high school, then go to UCLA to study and get my B.S and prove myself that I was successful. Then I wanna move on to medical school, attend the required pediatric internship and residency, attend the required training of the fellowship and then, finally become the neonatologist I've dreamed of becoming, but I don't know if I will. Ari is kind of like that, minus the school and studying part. He doesn't know what he is really gonna do and who he will become. I don't either. They look at me like I might do, but I don't. Ask me how successful I think I am on a scale of 1-10 and I'll answer you with the number 3. I don't think I'm successful in any way. It's insecurities.. It's stress.. It's sadness..It's struggles.. It's having no support.It's having no inspiration.It's feeling lonely.It's feeling sad.It's feeling alone.It's feeling abandoned.It's feeling useless.Out of all the characters I've read about, Ari is one of the most relatable. He was relatable in almost every way. Like me, he doesn't think before he acts, he just does it. He is frustrating at times and stupid because of the decisions he takes. Actually, he doesn't take decisions. He makes them. He still had troubles being open to himself and everyone else and couldn't control himself at times. He found himself to be a mystery just how he found his own family to be a mystery. It was hard reading about him, but it was also easy. I was impressed by the way he managed to actually grab my attention and captivate me, keep me going and reading, and although his point of view was not the best, I still enjoyed him very very much. I loved his character, and I didn't find him to be annoying. In fact, I felt bad for him. He didn't have any friends, he felt lonely, he was sad, he felt miserable, he was finding himself and had trouble discovering himself, he didn't have anyone, his parents were a mystery, he had a brother in prison, and he had twin sisters older than him which didn't make anything any better. He didn't have any friends that even his mom had to remind him. He would have dreams where he was lost and was looking for his dad and although his dad lived with him and his mom, he was never really able to talk to his dad and have a meaningful conversation. It was just sad.Until he met Dante. So, I also felt bad for Dante. Many would say Ari was an asshole? Annoying? Frustrating? A hard character to get into? Not understandable? Well, in my case, that was definitely not it. In my case, Dante was not an asshole, and not annoying, but he was a character that was hard to get into and understand. Dante was very confusing, more confusing than Ari. He would cry at times because a bird was dying and was getting shot at (coming from a supporter of animal rights I understood that but I didn't feel any emotion) and he would go from being a guy who would argue with Ari and then is laughing along with him. The reason I felt bad for him was because he was in love with Ari but he couldn't express it or tell him. He would even try to make him somewhat jealous but failed too. Although romance isn't the biggest thing in this book - more about friendship and finding yourself - Dante had trouble expressing his feelings to Ari. It was hard for him because he knew who he was and already had discovered himself, but Ari hadn't. Look, they were just such different characters but they managed to blend in with each other and I loved that.The writing of this was the easiest thing to follow, but it was also something else I didn't like. Sometimes, reading a book that I could fly to is the best for me because I'm simply flying through it, but with this one, that wasn't it. I wanted to read more but I couldn't because chapters were so short and so were the sentences. Dante and Ari would be having a big conversation and the whole pages were just small sentences. \n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cOkay. It sure worked for me.\u201d\u201cYeah. I think I get that, Dante.\u201d\u201cSo, well, that's over with then, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d\u201cA little.\u201d....\u201cDon't cry, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cYou're crying.\u201d\u201cI'm not.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nOKAY OKAY OKAY I WAS NOT OKAY AT SOME PARTS BUT OTHER TIMES I WAS LIKE \"OKAY NOW WHAT\" \"OKAY WHAT\" \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN OKAY\".Some chapters were 1 page short, others like 5, and the max was probably like 7. It wasn't boring, really, but the chapters could've been either longer and added more entertainment to make the story more entertaining and better in general.There's really nothing else I could say. Ari and Dante were, cute, but they were not the cutest. Lately, for some reason, I've been reading LGBT novels and for some reason been so interested in them and find them cute. This one didn't have many expectations but out of all the expectations I had, not many were met. Every LGBT book I've been reading and have read is actually very underrated or has no hype but then I'm quite glad about that because there's no hype so I end up enjoying it while others don't even bother. It's refreshing."}, {"userName": "Liam", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34270521-liam", "userReview": "This is the second time I've read this book now and I still have no words...This book is honestly the most beautiful book I have ever read.

Secondly, WHAT THE HECK WAS THE POINT OF THIS BOOK??!!??So the beginning was cute. It was cute in a middle-school-book kinda way. But going in thinking this was YA and getting an onslaught of 99% CONVERSATION and 0% PLOT made me feel ripped off. I must say though, I appreciate the diversity. That\u2019s definitely one of the only things I enjoyed about the book. Portraying Mexican boys and from a realistic perspective, v appreciated. But that doesn\u2019t erase the fact that I\u2019m unsure what the point of this book was and so I grew bored V V quickly and began skimming to a HIGH DEGREE.The writing was easy to read, though it was very  choppy  and  all over the place. Ari pissed me off multiple times, even though I  kinda  get it, but why he HAS to be a JERK for NO absolute reason, like plz youre 15 get over yourself.I\u2019m positive everyone is getting their torches ready to burn me at the stake, especially, amy and pragya BUT LISTEN HERE, WE CAN BE ADULTS AND WE CAN HAVE OPINIONS AND WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS OKAY.Anyways,,,Everyone is coming out of here crying and sobbing and being all sappy and I\u2019m just likeSo if anyone is willing to forgive me and maybe explain to me why this was such a beloved book that\u2019d be great.Kay thanks, sorrynotsorry bye. \u201cMaybe we just lived between hurting and healing.\u201d 2 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~this is only happening bc of peer pressure i hope youre happy"}, {"userName": "Emily (Books with Emily Fox)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox", "userReview": "This was such a quick read!

A must read!\nAristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe is written in first person by Aristotle or Ari as he likes to be called. Ari is a fifteen year old moody loner who at the beginning of his summer break decides to go swimming at the local pool. Though he really can't swim, never learned how, so he only floats around on his back. But when he hears, \"Want me to teach you how to swim?\" He meets Dante and a friendship blossoms.\nI can only describe the writing as brisk. Chapters are short and to the point. Some in fact are only a few sentence long. There are times I became convinced it really was written by a moody teenager. It's like reading Air's journal. Ari and Dante quickly became real people to me and I easily fell in love with them both. The story made me laugh and cry more times then I could count. There is no complex plot with many moving parts. It's just a simple story about two boys and how they discover themselves, the world and the part they play in it.\nMasterfully written! I can see why it's won so many awards."}], "description": "Dante can swim. Ari can't. Dante is articulate and self-assured. Ari has a hard time with words and suffers from self-doubt. Dante gets lost in poetry and art. Ari gets lost in thoughts of his older brother who is in prison. Dante is fair skinned. Ari's features are much darker. It seems that a boy like Dante, with his open and unique perspective on life, would be the last person to break down the walls that Ari has built around himself.But against all odds, when Ari and Dante meet, they develop a special bond that will teach them the most important truths of their lives, and help define the people they want to be. But there are big hurdles in their way, and only by believing in each other\u2015and the power of their friendship\u2015can Ari and Dante emerge stronger on the other side.", "title": "Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe\n      \n          (Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15801353-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe", "average": 4.35, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524277820l/15801353.jpg", "reviews": 22985, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4841310.Benjamin_Alire_S_enz", "name": "Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz"}], "type": ["Realistic Fiction", "Young Adult", "Lgbt", "Young Adult", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15801353-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12000020-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21529297-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17185965-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13495221-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23447923-the-inexplicable-logic-of-my-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6413788-last-night-i-sang-to-the-monster", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13237238-everything-begins-and-ends-at-the-kentucky-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2521835.He_Forgot_to_Say_Goodbye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/554037.Sammy_and_Juliana_in_Hollywood"]}
