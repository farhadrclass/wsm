The book is well-written and fun to read, very descriptive with lots of tasty details about Victorian minutiae. The main character runs into a great many famous people and though quite unbelievable, it's never ridiculous.

But reading does not always have to be a chore or an academic undertaking, and for the sheer pleasure of entertainment, for an appreciated escape from reality into the pages of a novel, not only does If I Never Get Back always and continuously grab the reader and hold his or her interest throughout, there are concurrently and furthermore both enough history and enough reality (or possible reality) to present a well balanced and even believable time travel odyssey of fun, of entertainment, of pathos and even potential tragedy (all in a framework of both meticulously researched and interesting historicity) that the novel actually often succeeds in literally making most of us (or at least many of us) not be able to put it down once started. The first time I read If I Never Get Back, I started reading at around 6:00 p.m. in the evening and I finished at 1:00 p.m. the next afternoon, not having gone to bed, not having bothered with either supper or breakfast, so enthralled and captivated was I with and by time traveling Sam Fowler and his exploits, his sojourn with the Cincinnati Red Stockings, his meetings and romps with Mark Twain, his love affair with the widowed sister of one of the baseball players he encounters. Well researched, engagingly and evocatively recounted, and in a style that is always readable, approachable (even when Darryl Brock waxes descriptive and poetic about the history of baseball), If I Never Get Back is for me and to me the absolutely perfect reading candy (not too substantial, not too sweet and saccharine, but also filled with just enough literary and historical substance to satisfy someone like myself, someone who is generally and for all internets and purposes rather academically inclined and enjoys perusing specific reality-based factoids). Most highly recommended (and you really DO NOT have to be all that much a baseball aficionado to enjoy If I Never Get Back, although if you actually despise baseball as a sport, you might consider a different novel, as there is and naturally so, much information about baseball and baseball history presented and described)."}, {"userName": "Nathan Coops", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24752708-nathan-coops", "userReview": "This is probably 4.5 stars due to the fact that the time travel aspects are pretty weak and the ending could be stronger, but I couldn't bring myself to knock a whole star off because, as a writer, the research Brock put into this novel absolutely floored me. If you love baseball and the 1800s and nostalgia, that will get you in the door, and you could simply stay there and enjoy this book, but if you want to delve a little farther, maybe run a few Google searches on the topics the main character discusses, you will find an intricately woven tale. Brock wrapped this story around real history to the point of even working in the real team photos and stats from the games. This book has a variety of ratings from reviewers and it is clear that it's not everyone's cup of tea. Some have compared it to Time and Again by Jack Finney and to Somewhere in Time by Richard Matheson. I'll be honest, I enjoyed this novel much more than either of those two. Finney dragged you through 1800s detail and drowned you in every smell and every crunch of fallen leaves without much hope of locating the plot. Matheson's protagonist was anything but likeable to me and I felt like punching him and telling him to stop being so whiny. For me, If I Never Get Back succeeded where those failed because I cared about Sam Fowler as a character, was surprised by him on multiple occasions, and felt like his flaws were believable. He inhabited a world that was certainly detailed, but the plot, while not perfect, held plenty of action. Some of the side benefits of this story were getting to meet Mark Twain and Jesse James. I am a big Twain fan and Brock does a nice job of bringing the author to life. While I wont claim that any other reviewers are wrong in their criticisms\u2014this book does indeed have some flaws\u2013 overall it was a story well worth my time by an author who is to be commended for his dedication to bringing it to life."}, {"userName": "Fred Forbes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes", "userReview": "\"You'll love this! My favorite book, given to me by my son. Send it back when you are done.\" said my friend Jim during my recent trip to NE Georgia, handing me a well read hardback novel. We had been discussing baseball as Yankee fans (him) and Red Sox fans (me) are often wont to do, so this book which depicts a time traveler zipping back from 1980's San Francisco to 1869 upstate NY in the presence of the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first professional team. Interesting how the game was played in those days, the rules are different, players do not wear gloves, much faster and more physical game and infested with gambling and cheating. A lot of great information for baseball fans but those who enjoy historical fiction will enjoy the great depiction of post Civil War America, the integration of folks like Mark Twain, Jesse James, the Fenian plan to invade Canada into the narrative, various events in our financial and business history as well as the necessary love interest. Just a great all around read! Sent his copy back then ordered the paperback for my buddy who is also a Yankee fan, former Mayor of Elmira (home and burial site of Twain) and expert on the rules of sports - something for him on almost every page and I think most readers will find this work worthy.

Throwing the modern man back into an earlier age to see what happens hardly is new, from Mark Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" onward.The Twain reference is appropriate, because the main character in \"If I Never Get Back,\" Sam Fowler, does in fact meet a young Twain on a twain \u2014 er, train \u2014 after he's inexplicably transported from the late 1980s to 1869 while waiting for an Amtrak train. Fowler gets to hang with his hero and even plots with him in a get-rich-quick scheme involving a plundered grave.But the bigger focus here, as evidenced by the bat on the book's cover, is baseball's early days. Fowler, a reporter in his \"real\" life, hooks up with the first real professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, as they travel East and elsewhere taking on the best ball teams the country has to offer, even getting to play for the legendary club. The book is baseball heavy in spots, so fans will be more transfixed than those who are ho-hum about America's pastime. The game was far different then, and Brock makes sure that, through Fowler, we know how different. Brock sets up encounter after encounter with old-school rules, surprising narrator Fowler so often with the differences it's as though the author is rapidly going through a checklist of them. So that gets a little repetitious, but it also showcases one of the big strengths of this very fine tale: extraordinary research. Brock puts us there, amid the sights and smells and sounds, from the choking air of coal-fueled Cincinnati to the difficulties of getting to the good stuff through a woman's 1869 attire.Yes, there's love here, as well, as Fowler puts the make on a teammate's lovely sister, who's involved in militant plots to free Ireland. Fowler is dogged by Irish gangsters from coast to coast, the Red Stockings keep on playing as their legend grows, and we're delightfully immersed in 1869-70 America, hip-deep. Brock takes us, in fact, from coast to coast, as the team plays as far east as New York and as far west as California. Peppering this stew is a spiritualist and, of course, Twain.Along the way, Fowler \"invents\" the bunt, the scoreboard and the hamburger, and plays a little ditty called \"Yellow Submarine\" for his teammates. \"If I Never Get Back\" has lots of these delightful, fun touches, which put us right with Fowler as modern folk experiencing 1869 for the first time. Not everything comes together perfectly, and I could just as easily give this book three stars, but the baseball factor and the research give this one a boost upward.Baseball fans could do a lot worse than reading \"If I Never Get Back\" as a spring pick-me-up to get them primed for the season."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "I accept that not everyone may enjoy If I Never Get Back as much as I do. This wonderful book has many of my favorite things: Baseball, historic pre-National League baseball, American History (especially nineteenth century history), Mark Twain, Irish history, paranormal activities, ghosts, time travel, and more baseball.Our hero, with lots of current time troubles including divorce, legal problems, anger management and alcohol abuse, finds himself flung back in time and space to 1869 where he meets up with the recently all-pro Cincinnati Red Stockings (the lineal ancestors of today\u2019s Reds \u2013 no kidding). From there the reader is taken on a Mark Twain-esque adventure, featuring the man himself.The supernatural themes and time travel elements reminded me of Marlys Millhiser\u2019s 1978 novel The Mirror as the reader has many hints about what is going on but mystery is the edifice upon which the narrative tension is built.Fun, poignant, well researched and well written, this could be a five star for someone like me who loves all this stuff, but could be enjoyable by most readers of speculative fiction because of the quality of Brock\u2019s work."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5810205-james", "userReview": "I\u2019d heard a lot of good things about this book, and there are plenty of positives, but what jumps out at me now that I\u2019m done is just how long it took me to get through it. A friend referred to it as \u201cIf I Never Get Finished\u201d in a comment and it seemed to fit. For 424 pages, it felt a lot more like 600+. I\u2019ve always liked stories about time travel, from \u201cBack to the Future\u201d to \u201cA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court.\u201d Daryl Brock really nails this history here, particularly regarding the 1869 Cincinnati Reds. Clearly he did a lot of home work to capture the characters on the team, and he placed them in a very historically detailed setting. It was fun to see Mark Twain pop up here as a character, and at times the book felt almost like an adventure Twain might have written himself. It felt like there was too much going on here, though. Some of the story lines, particularly with Johnny in the latter part of the book, just seemed to prolong things. I\u2019m not sure why we needed the bicycle racing, other than as a vehicle for Sam Fowler to make a premature (given the standards of 1869) moralistic stand about race. For all the bad guys chasing him, he sure managed to punch his way out of a lot of scrapes. If the Fenian Army was really much of a threat to anyone (maybe they weren\u2019t) it seems like they should have been able to finish him off a bit more easily. And for someone so shrewd in all other matters, how did he not see the gold crash coming? As to the Fenians and Cait, that story line grew weary for me pretty quick. I never picked up why she looked so familiar to him (perhaps I dozed off for that part), but the context seemed to hint at maybe an ancestor of some kind. If that\u2019s really how he knew her picture and had a square of her dress on a quilt in modern times, then going back 120 years to court her gets a bit creepy. It calls to mind the old song, \u201cI\u2019m My Own Grandpa.\u201d In the later chapters, when Sam returned to San Francisco, the intricate detail on the layout and landscape of the city felt like a means to showoff secret historical knowledge instead of nice color for an exciting tale. By that point I was ready for the book to end and I was tempted to start skimming. Likewise, some of the game recaps got to be too much, and I\u2019m someone who loves reading about baseball. Spoiler alert: But my biggest issue would have to be the end. What exactly was going on there? So he gets shot, sort of, and somehow that kills him back into the modern world, but not really. And he\u2019s insane and a bum, who turns back into pretty much of a total loser whose daughters don\u2019t even really want to spend time with him. I\u2019ve just read 400 pages of a guy who can single-handedly whip the Irish militia and he can barely feed himself by the epilogue. I\u2019d have rather not read that part and at least parted ways with Sam when he still had some dignity."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/785628-caroline", "userReview": "Old-school baseball, time travel, Mark Twain, Irish gangsters, and, naturally, romance - what more could you ask for?

It is a combination of Time Travel and Baseball as our narrator takes a spill in present day and wakes up in 1869 Cincinnati where he becomes associated with the first professional baseball team - the Cincinnati Red Stockings. While many baseball folks seem to bow down in homage to Kinsella for his time travel works of \"Shoeless Joe\" and \"The Iowa Baseball Confederacy\" this is a far superior book. It is filled with rich historical people, places and things and for the life of me I cannot figure out why this novel has never beed adapted into a movie. Where Kinsella's books are fantasy, this book really shows us what it was truly like to live in 1869, and the adulation that America's first professional team received. We have gamblers and we see lots of pollution. We have Mark Twain, along with members of the Irish Fenian Society who want to invade Canada, which are dead on accurate portrayals of what was going on with the country and the Irish after the Civil War. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_...Was the time travel real, was it a result of a blow to the head, a vivid imagination of a man going through a difficult psychological time in his life? Who is to tell, and all time travel books are obviously science fiction in nature, but instead of going forward in time Darryl Brock takes us back in time. He is a History professor and you can see and appreciate the amount of research he has done to make this as real and detailed a book as one can read. On a few book lists I have seen this as a Top 5 time travel book of all time. Other lists do not even mention it - most probably because it was written in 1990 and a lot of readers are not as interested in this sort of time travel, especially one involving a professional baseball team.

San Francisco journalist and one-time baseball hopeful Sam Fowler (full name Samuel Clemens Fowler), still reeling from the discovery of his unfaithful wife's affair and the breakup of his marriage, travels cross-country to claim the body of the father who deserted him as an infant. During a stopover on the train ride home, Fowler steps outside for a breath of air, becomes lightheaded and momentarily collapses, but regains consciousness moments later...or rather, centuries earlier, as he awakens to find himself in 1869! With no possible course of action other than to board the next steam-engine train that comes along, Fowler soon discovers that he's unintentionally joined the touring party of the 1869 Cincinnatti Red Stockings, the world's first fully professional baseball team. Soon \"drafted\" as a relief pitcher for the team, Sam finally realizes his dreams of becoming a baseball player, although the circumstances - and, indeed, the suddenly alien world around him - are far different from the ones he envisioned. Along the way, Sam becomes best friends with real-life Red Stocking Andy Leonard (the entire team, as individual characters, are described and portrayed in vivid detail throughout the book); begins a love affair with Andy's sister Cait; meets his namesake, Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain; becomes involved in a get-rich-quick scheme which includes grave-cracking; runs afoul of the notorious Dead Rabbits criminal gang; \"invents\" hot dogs and hamburgers to sell at the Stockings' games (and \"discovers\" Chinese food!); crosses the country from Ohio to California on a steam-engine train; encounters the James brothers out West; and, finally, finds himself back home more than 150 years before home ever existed, to come face-to-face with the shocking answer to the riddle of his time-travel experience.

Learned a surprising amount.KIRKUS REVIEWAn ingratiating first novel--in which an on-the-skids reporter steps off his Amtrak train and onto another carrying the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings. Sam Fowler--alcoholic, on the edge of divorce, returning from burying his father--has little reason to miss the 20th century; but beyond his enthusiasm for playing backup for the fledgling Reds, just beginning their first national tour, and his beguilement by a tougher, simpler, more innocent world, he feels he's been called back for a special reason--one involving Andy Leonard, his best friend on the Reds; Andy's mother Ann and sister Caitlin; and Cait's lover Colm, killed at Antietam. When Ann extracts Sam's promise to help Andy send her back to Ireland to be buried, Sam robs a grave (in connivance with his namesake Sam Clemens) to get the money and adds the Fenian Army, whose gold he's stolen, to the gamblers already out to kill him for his interference. Colm's ghost improbably keeps popping up to save Sam's life, but the fantasy, though overplotted, is well-sustained--until a helter-skelter shootout in San Francisco reveals Sam's role as Colm's avenger (a role most readers will have seen coming long since) only to dump him in a Monday-morning epilogue back in his own time, psychoanalyzed by public-health official as he sorrowfully awaits his chance to return to Cait and 1869. Best when it sticks to baseball, this is strong work from a promising starter who doesn't lose his stuff until around the seventh inning."}, {"userName": "Gerald Simpkins", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12437925-gerald-simpkins", "userReview": "I really liked this book. It took me a while to adapt to the authors' style but once I had done that, I was taken in by the story. Kudos to Darryl Brock for so thoroughly researching the way things were in the various cities in America, circa 1869. His attention to details of the period in general and of the cities of Cincinnati and San Francisco in particular were quite impressive. He thoroughly researched the earliest history of baseball too and that was quickly apparent. It all was woven into the storyline and character development in such a way to take me along through the pages eagerly anticipating each development. His love for one woman and her son who he meets while living in the 19th century is sweet and poignant, and a wonderful part of the story. I would read other work by Mr. Brock if I come across it.

The whole book could've been 100+ pages shorter. I don't care about bicycle races, Irish terrorists, or some Irish lady who's beyond perfect and exists because the main character needs to get laid.What drew me to this book was time travel and baseball and a high recommendation from a coworker. I went to college near Cincinnati and was excited to see what the old city was like. And I've written a novel that includes time travel and old times baseball, so I was intrigued as to how this author did it. What I got was some know it all gets out of every scrape dingbat who follows the Red Stockings and is beloved by all except the ol mean Irish. One of them is named \"Le Caron,\" who it turns out in real life WAS A FRIKKIN BRITISH SPY INFILTRATOR GUY FOR THE FENIANS! HOW COOL! Would've been nice for Brock to include that he was actually a Victorian James Bond instead of a dollar store version of Bill the Butcher in \"Gangs of New York.\" It's so hard to tell all the Red Stockings apart.

He does have Twain's voice down pat.)The epilogue could've been sosososo much shorter. I don't need to know every friggin detail of Hero's life. And I sure as hell don't care.

The historical research the author did is amazing and really puts the reader into the 19th century. I loved how the characters talked and the descriptions of the cities, the clothing, the transportation, and of course the ball games. There were a few things that bothered me. It seemed when Sam Fowler went back in time the characters he met did not question him as much as I thought they should have. A few times they raised eyebrows at his questions or his language or songs he sung that they'd never heard before, but it seemed a little too unbelievable that it didn't happen more often. Personally, I could have done without the scene with the prostitute. There were whole passages that could have been cut out because they didn't drive the story forward, and even distracted from the story. This made the book way longer than it needed to be.

Time travel is used briefly as a device to get the protagonist to 1869. The book is largely a story about the early days of baseball (with some side stories thrown in), which explains the title (think about the lyrics with \u201cTake me out to the ballgame\u2026\u201d). Thus, if you are not interested in reading about baseball in general, this book is probably not for you. 2) There is no hint of a mechanism for how the time travel occurs. 3) The front blurb on my copy states that the book is \u201cExciting and fast-paced\u201d; however, I did not find it to be fast paced, but more of a slog.As a time travel story, I can only give this a 4 out of 10."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7873503-paul", "userReview": "Brock won me over with the many layers of his fine novel, and, as did Jack Finney with \"Time and Again,\" he sparked my appreciation for Time Travel Historical Fiction.

After a wrenching period of adjustment, he comes to feel rejuvenated by his involvement with the nation's first pro baseball players. He also finds his senses quickening and tastes changing as he faces life-threatening 19th-century challenges on and off the baseball diamond. Through his attachments to the ballplayers and the lovely Caitlin O'Neill, he might just regain the sense of family he desperately needs. Darryl Brock masterfully evokes post-Civil War America's smoky, turbulent cities, the new transcontinental railroad that takes passengers over prairies and mountains to California, the dance halls and parlor houses, the financial booms and busts, and historical luminaries like Mark Twain and Jesse James. Equally appealing to sports fans and anyone who likes a good read, If I Never Get Back well deserves the Cleveland Plain Dealer's judgment that it \"hits a home run.\"", "title": "If I Never Get Back\n      \n          (If I Never Get Back #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237213.If_I_Never_Get_Back", "average": 4.09, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400861594l/237213.jpg", "reviews": 113, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/138826.Darryl_Brock", "name": "Darryl Brock"}], "type": ["Sports", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Historical", "Sports and Games"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237213.If_I_Never_Get_Back", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1984558.If_I_Never_Get_Back", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3248563-if-i-never-get-back", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237212.Two_in_the_Field", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237211.Havana_Heat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4461593-the-sun-field", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1536534.The_Heavenly_World_Series", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6798088-the-plated-city", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
