Most of it is the \"Woohoo! You can do this!\" type necessary to psyching yourself up to do the difficult business of wrangling words and sharing them. This book is not one of those books.This book is your older, wiser, best friend who loves you, and sits you down to say,Girl, I believe you can do it if you want to--you know I do. But first, let me show you what 'it' really looks like...OK, now are you sure you still want in? Yes? Well in that case... [Smiles spreads over her face. Eyes light up]Let me tell you how to do this part, then that part and oh! Here's something you might not even have thought about...and if you're going to do that, here's how not to screw it up...That's the kind of book this is.It is thoroughly up-to-date and written by someone who has been in and around the writing business for more than 20 years. (This will seem impossible when you bump into her at a writers' conference, but it's true. I know, because I've been following her career for much of that time.)This is the new, state-of-the-art bible for anyone thinking about writing for a living. It should be required reading for anyone who wants to make fiction a part of that business. (Spoiler Alert: you can, but it probably won't earn you all your money.)There's likely more information in here than you need right now, but dip in, root around, see what excites you and what you might be willing to try. As you build your business you might need to add a new string to your bow. (Content Marketing? Crowdfunding? Creating an author website?)When you do, this book will be waiting for you, full of good advice and an encouraging squeeze."}, {"userName": "Erika Dreifus", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3856462-erika-dreifus", "userReview": "Superb overview.

She has seen firsthand what is working and what is not. With THE BUSINESS OF BEING A WRITER, Friedman pours her insights into the pages of this well-crafted book. Many writers ignore the business aspects of publishing\u2014to their own detriment. As Friedman writes in the introduction: \u201cHere\u2019s the biggest danger, if there is one: Business concerns can distract from getting actual writing done and can even become a pleasurable means of avoiding the work altogether. No one avoids writing like writers. Producing the best work possible is hard and focusing on agents, social media marketing or conference-going feels easier. Writers may trick themselves into thinking that developing their business acumen, they improving as writers\u2014but all the business acumen in the world can\u2019t make up for inferior writing.\u201d (Page 10-11)A broad range of topics is tackled in these pages for various aspects of the publishing world. I hope this book will become a favorite reference book for many writers to learn and apply to their craft. As I read this book, I found many aspects to highlight and return for study. Here\u2019s another example from Chapter 21: \u201cTo establish a full-time living from your writing, it\u2019s essential to learn basic marketing principles. There is something of a formula, and it looks like this: the right message + the right words + the right audience = success! Typically the biggest missing piece for writers (and publishers too) is the right audience. That\u2019s partly because of the continuing belief that good art means not thinking about audience. While you may tune out market concerns during the creative process, once that process is over and it comes to the business of writing and publishing, there\u2019s no way around the discussion of audience. If you can\u2019t reach an audience, your career will stall. And to reach an audience, you first have to develop some idea of who they are.\u201d (Page 195)THE BUSINESS OF BEING A WRITER is packed with such insights. I highly recommend you get this book, read it\u2014but more importantly apply the information to your writing life."}, {"userName": "Yi", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37712-yi", "userReview": "This book puts into one smart package so much you need to know about making writing a business. And it lays out exactly why writing *should* and *can* be a business, if you want it to be that way. Art has the capacity to do so much in such a fractured time, but this importance is only underscored by our current climate. If the artists that we know can heal rifts aren't getting paid for it, then we're doing something wrong. I'm a graduate of a prestigious publishing course. And I wish this were around as a supplement to the materials we had when we were learning. I liked this book so much that I'm writing a series of blog posts to go along as Friedman's commentary and lessons evokes things I learned in my own publishing career. As a longtime working writer, so much of what she said resonated--and reinforces my desire to continue to encourage folks to try and make a living from this thing people insist on calling an art, a passion, \"just a thing I love\" over calling it a business. Go get this book, no matter where you are in your writing career. Or if you're just *thinking* about becoming a writer. Go get it. You can make a career out of this thing. Friedman tells you how."}, {"userName": "Tom Bentley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7373846-tom-bentley", "userReview": "This book is a keenly organized and comprehensive overview of the publishing industry, and the means by which modern writers can make a successful living. In persuasive and logical language, Friedman specifies how words are packaged and marketed in the digital age. Strong material on what agents do, querying, book proposals, and the perils (maybe it's not so scary after all) of establishing a writer's platform. The \"How Writers Make Money\" section spells out the myriad (and often overlooked) ways that people with writing talents can bring in some dough.The best part of the book is that it pulls no punches: writing for a living is effortful (oh, I know). But for those making the effort, it's a rewarding pursuit, on many levels.

She sure knows what she's talking about. Ms. Friedman tells you exactly what the publishing landscape is like right now, and how you, as a writer, can get your work published. It never ceases to amaze me how little preparation writers do when they want to query or publish a book. I'm always equating writing/publishing to other professions. Can you be a doctor without a medical degree? Can you be a lawyer without passing the bar? Yet so many writers jump feet first into the world of publishing when they don't know anything at all. Then they ask, Why isn't my book selling? Or, Why can't I get an agent? Read and research how to reach your goals.

She writes value-packed blog posts, offers top-notch guidance for authors, and keeps us in the know with The Hot Sheet. Basically, I all but jumped and down when Jane's book landed on my porch in a neat little package. And you'll see why. I've consumed more books on writing, publishing, and marketing than I can count, but this is one book that has it all: author branding, advertising, marketing, contracts, literary agents, and so much more. Jane also delivers guidance on more modern topics, such as crowdfunding, online freelance writing, contests, and online courses. The Business of Being a Writer is in-depth as well. You'll find yourself wondering how you ever got a long without it. More importantly, you'll be an informed writer by the time you've finished the last page. That's ultimately the goal of Jane's book: to inform writers and to teach them to have the right expectations in this industry. Hands down, this is the best book on the writer's life I've ever read.

The book reads like a volume of essays loaded with a wealth of concrete advice. Tons of business-like how-to strategies coupled with a gracious affect\u2014the tone of someone who genuinely wants to help writers understand the realities of, and to successfully navigate the publishing world. The book covers everything from traditional, self-publishing, and freelance writing. There are 5 parts, which can be read in any sequence. Part One: First Steps gets into the \u201cArt of Career Building,\u201d which includes good food for thought about which paths one can follow in order to become a writer in today\u2019s world that, let\u2019s face it, requires us to also be business people.Part Two: Understanding The Publishing Industry offers an expanded overview of all publishing media.Part Three: Getting Published digs deep into the specificity of different markets, including advice on submissions (queries, synopses, proposals, etc.).Part Four: The Writer As Entrepreneur targets insights on author platform, social media, and sales.Part Five: How Writers Make Money guides the reader toward the many other business opportunities available to writers such as freelance writing, grants, and teaching.And to cap off all the wealth of inspiration the book provides, there are appendixes with valuable information about contracts, legal issues, and many additional resources. Aside from the excellent guidance found in this book, two unique elements stand out. 1)\tI really enjoy the examples of the history of the publishing industry (across markets) that Friedman layers throughout.

And\u20262)\tFriedman is so generous to the reader, not only because of the expert advice she gives but also, as suggested in my opening paragraph, in the tone and style by which she shares knowledge. She does so by offering candid examples of her own path as a writer and publishing professional, including gentle reminders to the writer-as-artist to not take rejection so personally. It\u2019s a business, too. This tone and style serves as a model for the realities of a healthy life in publishing.
