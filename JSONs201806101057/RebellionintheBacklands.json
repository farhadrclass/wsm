For some strange reason, I have confused this book with Guimaraes's The Devil to Pay in the Backlands; and I have always assumed that the Brazilian film O Cangaceiro by Lima Barreto was based on Rebellion in the Backlands. I was wrong on both counts, but it doesn't matter. That's because, in the end, I regard da Cunha's book on the level of Herodotus, Thucydides and Gibbon as one of the greatest of all works of history.Picture to yourself an isolated and desolate part of Northeastern Brazil which was populated by the followers of a heretical religious leader called Antonio Conselheiro, or \"Anthony the Counselor.\" His followers were mostly mestizo jagun\u00e7os, backwoodsmen who were uniquely acquainted with this arid region of broken down mountain ranges. They built a capital of some 5,200 dwellings at a place called Canudos.Based on misconceptions of what Antonio's followers were up to, the newly formed Republic of Brazil send three military expeditions, all of whom were shot to pieces by hidden sharpshooters. Rarely did the Brazilian soldiers ever see their enemy, but they felt their bullets. From these failed expeditions, the jagun\u00e7os were able to replace their blunderbusses with the latest in military technology, along with several hundred thousand rounds of unused ammunition.Into this strange situation marched a fourth expedition in April 1897. This expedition was likewise being mowed down until the Brazilians were lucky enough in mid-course to choose Carlos Machado de Bittencourt as the commander. Bittencourt did what none of the other generals did: He set up strong bases of supply and got men, supplies, and food and water to the besieged expedition, who were within sight of Canudos but unable to proceed further.What makes this a unique book is that Euclides da Cunha was not only present at the scene, but he was sympathetic to the enemy:What did it matter that they [the Brazilians:] had six thousand rifles and six thousand sabers; of what avail were the blows from twelve thousand arms, the tread of twelve thousand military boots, their six thousand revolvers and twenty cannon, their thousands upon thousands of grenades and shrapnel shells; of what avail were the executions and the conflagrations, the hunger and the thirst which they had inflicted upon the enemy; what had they achieved by ten months of fighting and one hundred days of incessant cannonading; of what profit to them these heaps of ruins, that picture no pen could portray of the demolished churches, or, finally, that clutter of broken images, fallen altars, shattered saints -- and all this beneath a bright and tranquil sky which seemingly was quite unconcerned with it all, as they pursued their flaming ideal of absolutely extinguishing a form of religious belief that was deeply rooted and which brought consolation to their fellow-beings?This is a book that should be beside the cot of every NATO general officer in Afghanistan. There is an ironic postscript. Years after the massacre in Canudos -- for there was no general surrender: the jagun\u00e7os fought to the last man. Various sermons of Antonio Conselheiro were found and it has been determined that he was a legitimate religious leader and that both the Catholic Church and the Brazilian government attacked without legitimate cause."}, {"userName": "Tatiana Carlotti", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2780926-tatiana-carlotti", "userReview": "Fui contaminada pelos eventos que pipocam aqui e ali sobre os cem anos da morte de Euclides da Cunha.

Elizabeth Lowe (New York: Penguin Books, 2010), better to understand its relation to Mario Vargas Llosa's 900-page novel, La guerra del fin del mundo, about the same bloody episode in Brazil's northeastern backwoods in the 1890s. For some of the background on these two books, please see my earlier weblog entry History, fiction and historical fiction which is the first part of this essay.Da Cunha's book is considered a classic of Brazilian literature. It is dramatic, moving, encyclopedic and often \u2014 like its author \u2014 grandiloquently, pigheadedly wrong. The savage war in the Brazilian northeast backlands of Bahia state from 1893 to 1897 was a defining event of the new Brazilian republic, and Euclides da Cunha's amazingly vivid account of it, Os sert\u00f5es, is considered by many Brazilians as their country's most outstanding literary achievement. That should be reason enough to put it high on your reading list. But even if you don't care about this huge country (192 million people, a booming economy, a territory amounting to almost half the South American continent) that is rapidly rising to world influence, you will want to understand the dynamics of that war, because it has parallels to some of the world's most critical struggles today.That it also inspired Vargas Llosa's powerful and complex novel is for me an equally important reason for studying it. Vargas Llosa insists that he has never written a \"historical novel\", \"a more or less animated retelling of historical events\", which he apparently thinks of as a lesser category of literature. What he has done here and in La fiesta del chivo and his new novel on Roger Casement is to use thoroughly researched historical events to tell an original story that helps us feel and understand those events from an original perspective. And that's what I've tried to do in A Gift for the Sultan. To me, it's what a historical novel should be, and this is why I'm fascinated by the ways Vargas Llosa handles his material.But first, lets look at the material, the documented historical events, filtered through Da Cunha, that Vargas Llosa was working with. Every local and traditionalist movement is peculiar, the more local the more peculiar, and the movement around the holy man Ant\u00f4nio Conselheiro in the dense, ramshackle settlement of Canudos was so peculiar that the sophisticates in Salvador de Bahia or Rio de Janeiro could not believe it. A primitively armed, fanatically devout poor rural people was defeating every invasion by a modern, disciplined and experienced army with all the latest technology and firepower.Sound familiar? They didn't have car-bombs or suicide belts, but they were ingenious at using everything they did have (even slingshots and crossbows, plus traps and tricks) and did not hesitate to sacrifice their own lives to destroy an enemy that they saw as the Devil incarnate. Brazil had just become a republic in 1889, when the army deposed the ailing and weary Emperor Pedro II. Only a year earlier, Dom Pedro had achieved his long-held ambition to abolish slavery\u2014provoking the wrath of slave-using coffee-growers and contributing to the anti-monarchical sentiment among the urban elite that led to Dom Pedro's downfall.The rebellion in the backlands began as defiance against the republic and its new laws. A wandering visionary named Ant\u00f4nio Maciel, known as o conselheiro (the counselor), gathered a growing following as he denounced such impieties as a census (he said its purpose was to count people who would be returned to slavery), civil marriages and non-religious burials (an offense to God), and taxes (instead of tithes to the Church). He and most of his followers were barely literate, so we have only fragments of his preaching and exhortations recorded by people who regarded them as holy, and reconstructions from oral accounts by those who heard him. With the few believers he allowed to accompany him, he strode continually through the mountains, caatinga (shrubland), arroyos and canyons, stopping at each settlement to preach and also to command the restoration of abandoned chapels and cemeteries or the building of grand new ones, which he would demand be attended by a priest. The Catholic Church didn't know what to make of him. Sometimes a curate would invite him to preach, but the church hierarchy was suspicious of his strange sermons, equating the republic with \"the Dog\"\u2014meaning the Devil\u2014and predicting the end of the world and the advent of the Good Jesus to the backlands. But what caught the authorities' attention was his destruction of official edicts proclaiming the census, elections and taxes, and his orders not to obey any authorities of the republic.The governor of Bahia and the military chiefs in Rio assumed it would be simple to put down this nuisance, and sent a military expedition to quash it. It was destroyed. They sent another, much larger one, under the command of a hero of several other repressive campaigns, and this turned out even more disastrous\u2014Col. Moreira C\u00e9sar and thousands of his troops were killed, their huge Krups cannons seized, and the surviving troops chased from the territory. This was incomprehensible from primitively armed cowhands and homesteaders. The excitable press and their elite backers kept inventing more plausible (but completely fallacious) explanations for the ongoing disaster. They must be secretly financed by aristocrats who wanted to restore the empire, and/or by British capitalists who for other reasons wanted to dismember the republic.A former military man turned journalist and a fervent republican \u2014 that is, supporter of the coup that had deposed the Brazilian emperor in 1891 in order to \"modernize\" the country \u2014 Da Cunha got himself embedded in what turned out to be the final, and finally successful campaign to destroy the rebels. Os sert\u00f5es is not an easy book to follow, mainly because Da Cunha wants to tell so many different stories all at the same time: how the land forms of Brazil were created, how climate affects the habits of cattlemen and farmers in different regions, the history of settlement and pillage from earliest colonial times, and only then, after you've got through all that, the story of the \"war\", one failed military campaign after another until finally the rebellious settlement is overcome and eliminated. (A particular problem with this translation is the lack of maps, making it almost impossible to follow all the military maneuvers or the geological descriptions in detail.) For much of the book, the real protagonist is not the army or the Canudos resistance nor any of its human participants, but the land itself, which Da Cunha describes as a living thing, crashing thunderbolts and rainstorms to flood out farms and fragile villages, or sucking down every last drop of water and splitting open deep gorges during the droughts, then sprouting its hard sharp foliage to slash human invaders, almost as though the backlands were laughing at human attempts to civilize them..Another difficulty is that Da Cunha's literary standards, what he considered good writing, were so different from those of any of our contemporary best-selling authors. He is forever digressing and interrupting himself for the sake of reaching an especially dramatic phrase or description. And there is the additional problem that some of the things he asserts are completely screwball, especially race as determining character and ability. Then when the supposedly primitive and intellectually simple blacks or Amerindians or mestizos of the Canudos settlement keep outsmarting the supposedly superior Portuguese-descended commanders sent out to crush them, not acting according to type, he tries to explain it by phrenology \u2014 the shape of the cranium as a clue to brain development, in this case, of the wily savagery of the Canudos defenders.And there are many contradictions like this, because Da Cunha, though fervently on the side of the army, is often overwhelmed by sympathy for the supposedly inferior (racially and culturally) \"enemy\" who resists that army with courage and ingenuity. If they are so inferior, how can they be so smart and so brave? And how can they, with such poor weapons, obliterate one Brazilian army campaign after another? This gets the author into some very complex speculations about racial mixing and its peculiar consequences, and how those races were somehow better adapted to the harsh physical environment of the backlands. It's as though the social groupings there \u2014 the Indians, the blacks, the mestizos \u2014 were themselves parts of the natural environment, not to be thought of as \"intelligent\" any more than the climate or the vegetation or the sharp-edged geology, but that all together they composed the hostile, alien environment that overwhelmed the urban, cultured, white military officers with their neatly formed batallions and cannons and bugle calls.Vargas Llosa rehumanizes these characters. He takes da Cunha's scattered and often admiring portraits of the famously cruel and brutal bandits Pahe\u00fa, Jo\u00e3o Grande and Jo\u00e3o Abade \u2014 real outlaws converted to the Counselor's faith to become fierce defenders of the community \u2014 and others and develops them into full, complex psychological characters whose intelligence and human sensibilities, and the wrongs they've suffered and the things they desire, make fully understandable what for da Cunha were simply unexplainable and unreasoned acts of instinct. And he also invents characters \u2014 a \"near-sighted journalist\" (unnamed), a Scottish anarchist who calls himself Galileo Gall, the baron of Ca\u00f1abrava, the much-abused Jurema, and various midlevel Brazilian military men among them \u2014 to let us see this conflict from other points of view. In all, it is a magnificent denunciation of fanaticism, not just (not even principally) of the Counselor's faithful followers, but also (and even more evidently) the fanaticism of those who thought they were bringing civilization but ended up bringing only total destruction to this poor community.Like Chechenya, and many other places. It's a marvelous, passionate and thought-provoking novel."}, {"userName": "Adam Frederik", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23700084-adam-frederik", "userReview": "This book should be standard reading for any soldier, any politician and any voter.

Mas n\u00e3o estava preparada para o que encontrei. O autor se utiliza de uma quantidade enorme de palavras dif\u00edceis, v\u00e1rias numa mesma frase que o dicion\u00e1rio foi leitura complementar o tempo todo. O objetivo foi descrever o sert\u00e3o onde a a\u00e7\u00e3o vai se desenrolar mas houve um abuso dessas palavras de forma que n\u00e3o consegui formar uma imagem mental desse cen\u00e1rio. A impress\u00e3o que tive foi que o autor estava preocupado em exibir sua erudi\u00e7\u00e3o e foi bem dif\u00edcil chegar ao final dessa primeira parte. Quem tiver muita vontade de ler essa obra e teme desistir por conta dessa primeira parte pode partir direto para a parte 2 sem que haja preju\u00edzo da compreens\u00e3o da trama. Posso resumir em palavras mais acess\u00edveis: o sert\u00e3o \u00e9 um ambiente extremamente seco, in\u00f3spito, rude, a sobreviv\u00eancia l\u00e1 \u00e9 um verdadeiro desafio e acaba tornando o homem mais forte.A segunda parte, O Homem traz uma esp\u00e9cie de estudo antropol\u00f3gico e tem como objetivo descrever o sertanejo desde sua origem. Essa parte \u00e9 bem mais acess\u00edvel e melhorou bastante. Mesmo assim, o livro ainda n\u00e3o me pegou, tudo bem que se trata do relato de um acontecimento hist\u00f3rico mas o autor at\u00e9 agora fez isso com um tom bem neutro, sem colocar qualquer emo\u00e7\u00e3o, se restringindo mesmo a descrever os acontecimentos.

Veremos.Continuando de onde parei, esse segundo volume traz a terceira parte, A Luta desdobrada em v\u00e1rios cap\u00edtulos que descrevem detalhadamente essa luta sangrenta e t\u00e3o sem sentido, descrito pela hist\u00f3ria como um dos maiores crimes \u00e0 humanidade.A Guerra de Canudos ocorreu entre 1896 e 1897 e foi formada por quatro expedi\u00e7\u00f5es mandadas para debelar essa \"revolta\", tendo Euclides participado como jornalista da \u00faltima. Apesar de ter lido atentamente o livro todo \u00e9 muito dif\u00edcil conseguir explicar de forma racional como os sertanejos conseguiram manter vantagem por cerca de 10 meses. O principal fator foi o profundo conhecimento que eles tinham do in\u00f3spito ambiente onde se desenrolou a a\u00e7\u00e3o, al\u00e9m de sua capacidade de sobreviv\u00eancia nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es cr\u00edticas e mals\u00e3s de uma seca. Isso somado ao excesso de confian\u00e7a do ex\u00e9rcito.Apesar de ser retratado por Euclides como a Vendeia brasileira, ou seja, uma luta de monarquistas contra republicanos, parece que essa n\u00e3o \u00e9 toda a verdade e motiva\u00e7\u00e3o. Ant\u00f4nio Conselheiro passou 25 anos vagando pelo sert\u00e3o amealhando simpatias de um povo sofrido e carente das necessidades mais b\u00e1sicas que foram se unindo a ele por acreditarem na promessa de um futuro mais justo.

Antonio the Counselor was someone we would recognize today as a cult leader, with all the charismatic madness we have seen in subsequent cults. He began wandering a particularly inhospitable back land of Northeast Brazil, encouraging people to rebuild churches, and drew a movement around him. As with other movements, part of the appeal was clearly a mesmerizing presence, part of it was an egalitarian approach to the racism of the national culture, part of it the welcoming embrace extended to outsiders, including some bandits who contributed to the defense. His ideology had less appealing facets as well; he thought monarchy to be the natural, religious order of things, which provoked the infant Brazilian Republic. His bandits turned their skills to supporting the community by robbing the neighboring ranches. What little remains of his utterances has a message that is, when coherent, both communitarian and millenarian, and his justice was, according to da Cunha who seems to have sought out every document, more concerned with faith than with what the wider Brazilian society would have seen as morals. He was a man who urged his faithful to build, not just a new church (eventually the blinds for some of his sharpshooters), but also huts laid out in a haphazard fashion, which eventually became a fatal labyrinth for Brazilian soldiers. Appropriately enough, the event that sparked the war against him was a dispute over some lumber he wished to buy. The Brazilian Army reacted with pride in the new Republic, disrepect for the backlanders, and a criminal disregard for adequate preparation. As a result, it took four expeditions and almost a year to subdue the rebels, who fought an underarmed guerrilla with skill, passion and cruelty. At the end, very few survived. Da Cunha is very modern in his distaste for the military's ineptitude and savagery; he had nothing in common with Antonio's beliefs, but he thought the state had committed a crime."}, {"userName": "Dario Andrade", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26369321-dario-andrade", "userReview": "Os sert\u00f5es \u00e9 dos grandes livros para se entender o Brasil.

The government led three assaults on Canudos, leading to three resounding defeats. Finally, under a new military commander, a fourth expedition was led into the backlands; the commander was determined to but an end to the rebellion. Euclides Da Cunha was a reporter assigned to cover the fourth campaign.This extraordinary chronicle begins with a description of the land of northeast Brazil as the republican army traversed the hellish backlands terrain. Next, Da Cunha attempts to provide a context for the Brazillian populace and how the backlander and the coastal/city dwellers of developed differently. His antiquated sociology seems racist by today's standards (one of the pitfalls of viewing history through 21st century eyes); but as a reporter, Da Cunha was simply using the social Darwinism norms of the day to extrapolate his point. To be sure, the first two thirds of this book relates information that from other sources (Da Cuna only witnessed the last of four expeditions into the backlands). But it is a riveting account nonetheless, though Da Cunha's tone is inconsistent throughout Backlands; he is chronicling the responsibilities and advances of the new government, but he finds himself questioning what the government is doing to the backlanders. (Apparently Brazillian publishing houses were scarce and there was no professional editing of this book).I had never heard of the Canudos rebellion before starting this book, but Da Cahuna's approach to his material made it accessible. It is not only an extraordinary historical document but a great moral treatise on armed conflict. This is one of the great works of Brazillian literature of the time for a reason and should be read more often."}, {"userName": "David C.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44551357-david-c", "userReview": "Circa 1890, a religious community arose in the unbelievably harsh section of Brazil they call the Northeast; more accurately, in the easternmost area where the shoreline juts into the Atlantic. The author, an army engineer, details the \"...War and Peace of Brazil...\". Tellingly, this book has never been out of print after 125 years. It is a massive book, and except for the overlong description of the horrible terrain(suffice to say fierce heat, equatorial sun, desperate drought)it never drags. The cult of 5500 souls, in a village where the widest street was 8 feet across, of 3500 buildings, was apparently attracting the wrath of the government.  In the first sortie, ill-organized, unprepared troops were soundly beaten by the sect. The survivors retreated, down a road lined with dead soldiers, officers and horses, that were propped up, as ghastly reminders of ignominy. The glare of sunlight on the highly reflective soil and rocks, and the lack of water, caused immense suffering. In the most unbelievable stupidity, the soldiers lost over a million rounds of ammo to the defenders. Two more defeats; and they finally mounted an operation that succeeded to wipe the cult out.  The foes fought their battles on the narrow streets and and sometimes spent weeks inside the same building, unable to advance, driven mad by hunger, and thirst and fear. Let us hope we never have to fight Brazil. Truly remarkable book that deserves more attention."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3371879-alex", "userReview": "I have given this book five stars because it is a fascinating read. It can be, I think, considered under that opaque category of \"The Latin American\" essay, along with Sarmiento's Facundo, Rod\u00f3's Ariel, etc. Da Cunha's book is riveting, it is racist in its antiquated science, but it is also humanistic in its attempt to demonstrate to Brazil in 1902 the \"borrowed culture\" of its coastal cities. It is a jeremiad of the senseless violence that occurs between fear and misled nationalism in the budding years of a Republic in the Americas.

What we had to face here was the unlooked-for resurrection, under arms, of an old society, a dead society, galvanized into life by a madman. We were not acquainted with this society; it was not possible for us to have been acquainted with it. The adventurers of the seventeenth century, it is true, would encounter in it conditions with which they were familiar, just as the visionaries of the Middle Ages would be at home among the demonopaths of the Varzenis or the Stundists of Russia; for these epidemic psychoses make their appearance in all ages and in all places, as obvious anachronisms, inevitable contrasts in the uneven evolution of the peoples - contrasts which become especially evident at a time when a broad movement is vigorously impelling the backward peoples towards a higher and civilized way of life. We then behold the exaggerated Perfectionists breaking through the triumphant industrialism of North America, or the somber St\u00fcrmisch sect, inexplicably inspired by the genius of Klopstock, sharing the cradle of the German renascence.With us, the phenomenon is perhaps still more readily to be explained. After having lived for four hundred years on a vast stretch of seaboard, where we enjoyed the reflections of civilized life, we suddenly came into an unlooked-for inheritance in the form of the Republic. Caught up in the sweep of modern ideas, we abruptly mounted the ladder, leaving behind us in their centuries-old semidarkness a third of our people in the heart of our country. Deluded by a civilization which came to us second hand; rejecting, blind copyists that we were, all that was best in the organic codes of other nations, and shunning, in our revolutionary zeal, the slightest compromise with the exigencies of our own national interests, we merely succeeded in deepening the contrast between our mode of life and that of our rude native sons, who were more alien to us in this land of ours than were the immigrants who came from Europe. For it was not an ocean which separated us from them but three whole centuries.And when, through our own undeniable lack of foresight, we permitted a nucleus of maniacs to form among them, we failed to see the deeper meaning of the event. Instead, we looked at it from the narrow-minded point of view of partisan politics. In the presence of these monstrous aberrations, we had a revealing fit of consternation; and, with an intrepidity that was worthy of a better cause, we proceeded to put them down with bayonets, thereby causing history to repeat itself, as we made yet another inglorious incursion into these unfortunate regions, opening up once more the grass-grown trails of the bandeiras.In the backlands agitator, whose revolt was a phase of rebellion against the natural order of things, we beheld a serious adversary, a mighty foe-man representing a regime which we had done away with, one who was capable of overthrowing our nascent institutions.And Canudos was our Vend\u00e9e.\""}, {"userName": "Antonio", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21606204-antonio", "userReview": "Come\u00e7ando pelo Brasil, \u00e9 indispens\u00e1vel a leitura de Os Sert\u00f5es, de Euclides da Cunha. \u00c9 curto e n\u00e3o \u00e9 modelo de estilo.
