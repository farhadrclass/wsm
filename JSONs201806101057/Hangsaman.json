But there isn't much you need to know, going in. A coming-of-ager but in the Bell Jar or Catcher In The Rye vein; author Shirley Jackson's quirky, truthful-feeling book hits home with force, if not exactly heart-warmingly. A sophisticated, naive ing\u00e9nue narrates her abrupt path from daughter and child to \"college woman\", sometimes at a singing pitch of self-discovery, sometimes reading all the signs wrongly and foundering on the rocks. Can sophisticated and na\u00efve both be present at once ? There's nothing new here, exactly, but it isn't the lyrics so much as the music, the fretful high-wire performance, the atmosphere of precocious youth wasting itself in girlish crushes, misread friendships and in the inevitable lonely vigils of the night, sighing ... that rings so true. Jackson has worked out a kind of integrated second-person commentary, often in the voicing of a news reporter, a detective or some other questioning persona--- but within the narration of the main character, Natalie: \"She wanted to sing and did so, soundlessly, her mouth against the fogged window of the bus, thinking as she sang, And when I first saw Natalie Waite, the most incredible personality of our time, the unbelievably talented, vivid, almost girlish creature--when I first saw her, she was sitting in a bus, exactly as I or you might be, and for a minute I noticed nothing of her richness ... and then she turned and smiled at me. Now, knowing her for what she is, the most vividly talented actress (murderess? courtesan? dancer?) of our time or perhaps any time, I can see more clearly the enchanting contradictions within her--her humor, her vicious flashing temper, so easily aroused and so quickly controlled by her iron will; her world-weary cynicism (she has, after all, suffered more than perhaps any other from the stings and arrows of outrageous fortune), her magnificent mind, so full of information, of deep pockets never explored wherein lie glowing thoughts ...\"Stings. This can be fun, light and satirical, but it can also tilt toward the unnerving, as it is literally another voice in her head. Jackson is after the coping mechanisms that come to us in our adolescence, those that evolve to distance or protect us -- and those that are so witheringly critical that they are generally blunted and stomped by experience.There is a great supporting cast, so naturally rendered that they somehow don't come off as instant 'characters'. Which they are. The insufferably vain Father character here is strikingly, embarrassingly funny and lame. His letters to Natalie at college are little masterpieces of self-importance and blocked empathy. Movies come to mind. Resemblances stretch from the absolutely blatant fraudulence of Billy Liar all the way to the absolutely confoundingly weirdo Carnival Of Souls. Step right up. There are three balanced and interlocked acts to this book, each with its own timbre and emotional charge; it isn't perfect, we overspend time in Natalie's internal argument that would have been better externalized-- but what gets across is compelling and the faults are minor. The third and Finale part is beautifully quirked-out and inspired. Probably best not to say how or why. Giving this five stars, as much for intent and inspiration as for execution."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "[In part one, Natalie hangs out with her shitty, pompous writer dad.

It is chilling, hyper-surreal, and told with a mind-altering narrative voice. HANGSAMAN is like shooting a cocktail of vodka and meth: it's weird, burns like hell, and you don't come down from those fever dreams the same person you were before the experience. The most amazing thing about HANGSAMAN is that, on the surface, nothing happens. A girl, Natalie, attends a dinner party where she is possibly assaulted, starts college, drinks a lot of martinis with professors, and goes on long, thought-addled walks. This doesn't even sound like a story worth reading, and that's where Jackson works some voodoo. She manages to create a dense atmosphere of isolation that permeates the spaces between the non-events. Even the trauma that triggers Natalie's increasingly strange psychological break doesn't \"happen\" in the usual sense of events unfolding on a page. Instead, Jackson gives the reader access to only the reverberations of the event. This is either a masterful literary technique, or dark magic, and I'm placing bets on the latter. The story received through the twisted and unreliable narrator who recites Natalie's thoughts is fascinating, in the way a fish hook piercing flesh is sickly fascinating. Natalie doesn't fit in, and the details of life in an all-girls dorm is unimpeachable, including the strange spate of random thefts. Several girls report being slapped awake in the middle of the night, but are too startled to identify the culprit. Is it Natalie, slapping and stealing? There are plenty of clues it probably, maybe is - but HANGSAMAN is not a novel of absolutes. Jackson litters the work with half-hints I read with the excitement of discovering something amazingly rare in a pile of moldering leaves. For example, Natalie writes gut-wrenching letters home to her father, but the missives may or may not have been intercepted by her mother. Natalie may or may not be in a sexual relationship with a girl in the dorm, or Natalie may or may not \"simply\" have an alternate personality brought on by the trauma that we never see directly. The narrator is a wily one, and it is unclear where Natalie ends and the narrator begins. The two bleed into one another until you cannot distinguish your vantage within the story. This is part of Jackson's dark magic: she gives you direct access to the experience of a deeply disturbed mind, but without the gimmicky feel of first person. Indeed, having an \"I\" in HANGSAMAN would change the texture of the work, damage it irreparably. Natalie's entire problem is she has no idea who she is, and just as she was on the cusp of discovery, trauma knocked her from being a bit overly imaginative into being batshit crazy. Natalie has no \"I,\" and Jackson wisely steers clear of trying to force one. Jackson leverages the strange, blended narrative persona to excellent effect right from the opening scenes. A detective \"interrogates\" Natalie\u2026 in her mind. It is only on a second (or third) read that it sinks in that the exchange between Natalie and her imaginary detective is so very, very strange because the detective is prescient. His questions can be applied to multiple situations that arise throughout the novel, and it is illuminating that at the time the questions are shared with the reader, they are entirely out of context. In some sense, it feels like Natalie's future self (the narrator?) is interjecting thoughts back into the past. It exacerbates the disorientation HANGSAMAN inspires, and it resonates with the strange psychology in us all.HANGSAMAN is a bizarre, nightmare trance. I came up from reading it feeling deeply affected, infected. The prose warped my mind. I found myself thinking like the narrator reporting Natalie's musings; it was disturbing. HANGSAMAN is not a book for anyone on the brink of a mental breakdown. It is a dangerous beast. It will swallow you whole. It is frightfully unique, and one of the most masterful novels I've experienced. \ufeff"}, {"userName": "James Everington", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4539306-james-everington", "userReview": "Hangsaman is a strange novel by any standards; as if trying to remember a dream I feel the urge to write this blog quickly as I can, before it\u2019s unique internal logic fades from my mind. Its central character is Natalie Whaite, a seventeen-year old American girl on the verge of going to college. The surface level events of the story are mundane, trite even: Natalie has bourgeois parents, and goes to a respectable girls-only college. But what happens externally is not really the point; this is a story about Natalie\u2019s inner life, and how she reacts to and absorbs the world around her: parties thrown by her parents; the machinations of cliquey and spiteful college girls; the strangeness of returning to her family abode after months away. Transformed by Jackson\u2019s inimitable prose, these mundane events seem vividly odd; sinister even. How much of this sense of threat is real and how much projected onto the world by Natalie\u2019s precocious yet vulnerable psyche is one of the central ambiguities of the book.Right from the start it is clear Natalie has a vivid imagination; much like Eleanor from The Haunting Of Hill House, Natalie is someone whose propensity for daydreaming and fantasy seems alarmingly strong. If her urge for escapism is so dominant, what is she escaping from? Early on in the story a potentially traumatic event is hinted at, and it is clear that Natalie is repressing something \u2013 but exactly what occurred is opaque, repressed by Jackson\u2019s narrative as much as by Natalie\u2019s mind. Exactly what Natalie is thinking and feeling is often obscure \u2013 it certainly isn\u2019t revealed directly in her chirpy interactions with a college professor and his young wife, or in her playful letters home to her father. But what the reader becomes alert to is the brief glimpses that Natalie might actually feel unbearably lonely and distanced from the world. And it\u2019s easy to understand why Natalie might be so alienated, when it and the characters it is peopled with are presented with satirical humour by Jackson. In part this works so well because isn\u2019t this how we see the world as a teenager, as something faintly unrealistic, as a joke being played on us? Because everything is focused through the character of Natalie, the differences in tone (the novel can be cruelly humorous one minute, and disturbingly sinister the next) don\u2019t seem to jar. It shouldn\u2019t work, but it does.As the book reaches its final third, it darkens considerably, and the exact extent of what is real and what Natalie imagines is unclear, with double and triple bluffs confounding the reader. It\u2019s a compelling read, and despite similarities to The Bell Jar and The Catcher In The Rye, a unique experience. There\u2019s no one quite like Shirley Jackson andHangsaman seems to me to be her first queer, twisted masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Moira Russell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1630617-moira-russell", "userReview": "PATHETICALLY EXCITED to have this on the Kindle, I have a tattered old paperback with this cover: http://www.rockin-r.net/~karl/shirley..."}, {"userName": "Fiona MacDonald", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2417021-fiona-macdonald", "userReview": "Enjoyable, weird, eerie, creepy, disjointed, dreamlike, fantastical.

It switches from first to third person sometimes too. And then you honestly don't know what's real or not real so you feel very confused at times. And you also may end up not liking anyone (I know I didn't) but may come away feeling sorry for Natalie (I did) and then just confused again. Just go read Moonlight Reader's REVIEW of this book since it will make way more sense than my mutterings about things below.First, Natalie and her family are messed up. You find that out quickly when you realize her terrible father refers to himself as God everyday when they are having breakfast. Her mother is scared of being alone with her father (I know I would be too) and also scared of doing anything wrong. Natalie's brother, Bud is barely there and Natalie is at times doing her best to please her father, but also trying to help her mother though she has barely concealed contempt for her at times. When Natalie starts having a back and forth conversation with a police detective you don't know if Jackson is trying to allude to something that is going to happen, or it's all just in Natalie's imagination.When Natalie finally leaves for college, things get worse for her. She realizes that she has no friends, the other girls call her \"Spooky\" and you start to realize that what you are being told is not the whole truth as a reader. I started to pick up on things here and there and realized that Natalie was not realizing what was not being said a lot of times. When Natalie weirdly befriends one of her professor's wives, things actually seem a bit better, but you realize she has fallen into the mess of another family that she is finding even heard to extricate herself from. I think the writing at times got a bit muddled (sorry Ms. Jackson) I assume that is intentional, since I have read some of Jackson's other works, and it seems as if she chooses each word with care. Some sentences last an entire paragraph. At times it made my eyes glaze over. And you start to realize that maybe Jackson is doing that on purpose since you start to realize that maybe Natalie is speaking some of this out of the way stuff out loud. The flow was a bit off for me though. Due to the writing I mentioned above, it just made things grind to a halt at times. Since this is such a short book it should not have taken me that long to finish it, but it did. I think that after Natalie goes away to school things drag a bit until she meet's her professor's wife. The setting of a young girl's home and than college experience was interesting. I just don't remember being alone at college. My brother was an upperclassman so everyone called me Little (insert my brother's name here) so I didn't even have my own identity, I was just his little sister even after he graduated. I will say that everyone treated me differently though. He was a jock, and though I was in high school, I decided to just focus on my grades and not play any sports. When the school's basketball coach found out I could play and how good I was apparently she was not happy.I digress. The ending of the book gets increasingly dark and leaves the reader with a feeling that something worse is coming Natalie's way due to what all the signs are pointing to regarding her behavior. I wouldn't really call this a Gothic book or even a straight up horror story though Goodreads classifies it as such. It's just an interesting look at the different stages in a woman's life. We have the young girl (naive and at times defiant) the newlywed (scared of what she did by giving up her own identity) and the married woman (realizing that being married was not the ultimate prize that she thought it would be). So you do get the maiden, the mother, and the crone in this one giving a cautionary tale about what it means to be a woman."}, {"userName": "nostalgebraist", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8178894-nostalgebraist", "userReview": "I've loved several of Shirley Jackson's other books but this time the magic spell didn't work on me, and when a spell fails, one is left with little to do but gawk at the occult paraphernalia involved in its casting, which are bound to ultimately seem at once baffling and quaint.Some of Jackson's other books are expertly engineered spell-casting machines, the parameters of every pentacle chosen for optimal potency, no sigil lacking even the smallest significant curlicue. This one is more of a Rube Goldberg apparatus, an assembly of lots of striking little pieces that don't seem to add up to the sum of their parts, much less more. When I Googled around in an effort to figure out what on earth it all meant, I found . . . a piece on Slate about the experience of finishing the book and Googling around in an effort to figure out what on earth it all meant.There were quite a few times in this book the protagonist's neuroses were so difficult for me to understand or relate to that I just wanted to say: oh, get over yourself. By contrast I never would have thought the same of other Jackson protagonists like Merricat or Eleanor. It's possible that the difference here is simply that I've personally experienced one kind of neurosis and not another. But it feels like more than that. The psychology in Hangsaman is as rambling and shaggy doggish as the plotting. Every time something new happened I wanted to annotate both the event itself and Natalie's response with a \"?\" as though they were chess moves.I suppose there is a certain unity there: Jackson's books inspire these simple and composed sorts of responses that can be boiled down to individual symbols. When I started reading We Have Always Lived In The Castle, my first status update on Goodreads simply read\"!\"Whereas anything I might want to say about Hangsaman really just boils down to\"?\""}, {"userName": "Lee Foust", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13984676-lee-foust", "userReview": "It occurred to me, back in October, that I probably read a lot more male authors than female--not because--at least I hope not because--I'm sexist, but because my culture is and one is nothing if not a product of many crosscurrents of life--culture, family, language, education, etc. etc. So, thanks to Goodreads I was able to chart just exactly how gender-skewed my reading is: 2012: 3/18, 2013: 11/45, 2014: 9/26, 2015: 8/41. Even by consciously choosing those books by females on my to-read shelf over the final months of 2016 I only managed to read 11/50 by female authors. This is not acceptable, I decided, and it must change. So right now 18 of my last 21 books read have been by female authors. Many of them have been terrific--in fact I see no correlation between gender and aesthetic literary quality at all--it's only the bias of the established cannon and my trying to read all of the great books, I suppose, that's unbalanced my reading by gender. But I must say, because I'm so much more aware of an author's gender at this particular moment, that this is the novel that I was looking for, waiting for.I don't think a man (of any gender, really, what I mean to say is someone with a man's experience of the world) could have written Hangsaman. This is a novel that's genius lies at the heart of female experience. I felt privileged to read it and enter into this mysterious world of female adolescence, alienation, imagination (coping mechanism?) and, ultimately, horror. No, it's not a Gothic like The Haunting of Hill House but it's protagonist's alienation, subtle refusal, which grows into a near-abandonment of the world she knows but can only fear for the unknown (even suicide) is much more terrifying than any ghost story will ever be. It really touched a nerve.Amazing and extra chilling here--and I think part and parcel of female experience--is that Natalie isn't really allowed to have experiences the way men are. Man are encouraged to self-reflect, to criticize the world, to share their opinion, to feel that they're at the center of the world and to do what they please in answer to it. Early on (the novel is in three unnumbered sections, rather like a three-act play) we see Natalie's brother opting out of the patriarchy's cocktail party--even condescendingly offering to help Natalie escape with him. But, no, like most women, I surmise, Natalie's only validation is through the patriarchy itself, therefore abandoning her father's party would be the only thing worse than the awkwardness of attending it. It is awkward. She's raped in the end but appears to take it in stride: she has no language, apparently, to speak of it except once, later, in passing, as \"the bad thing.\" We are, as I mentioned above, the product of our culture--see early 1950s USA suburban Middle Class--rape was not a thing spoken of. Natalie tolerates it. As her culture tolerates it. \"..the gap between the poetry she wrote and the poetry she contained was, for Natalie, something unsolvable.\"In part two, Natalie goes to college to learn to write/speak, but only finds a further segment of her father (and lesser than he!) in a prof who admires her father and appears a much less active teacher than rapist himself--well, ok, diddler of students both in the form of having married one and of courting (to put it politely, as the novel itself does) another on the side. At any rate, Natalie's confusion, resentment and interior journey only grow more and more mysterious, awkward and detached. Her grammar is corrected, but she's still not given a language with which to speak her loneliness. And that sad soliloquy of resentment and displacement is the hardest thing to speak too, even for a man--how much worse to be part of heard of girls being trained by an all-male faculty in a college that resembles a military academy, for all of its radically progressive shenanigans. No one is even there to listen should Natalie even learn to speak her experience.In this second section mysteries abound: there's a thief, there are voices in and out of Natalie's head, there are secret visitors in the dorms at night, un-serious initiations, threatening caretakers, there's a mysterious fellow loner girl who may be an imaginary friend or something even more perverse--we poor readers will never know the truth of it. I bring up the facts of the novel--which I normally never do in a review--because they're all, to me, replacements for the language Natalie's not learning, at college, to speak. The novel is mysterious because, without a proper language to speak it, Natalie's experience becomes this fragmentary series of disjointed mysteries. She can't really have experiences in any kind of normalizing narrative way--at least not in the male, literary/historical sense--because she hasn't the proper words with which to re-live and recount them.Where is she then, in the novel's third section? On a dark and seemingly casually chosen road with a mysterious companion. I don't want to spoil the ending--but I can't really because it's as ineffable as the rest. There's no language to speak Natalie's story in 1951, so it remains untold. Hangsaman is the story of its own impossible composition. It's message would appear to be: give me the words to tell the real story for without them I have no meaning. Nathalie's last words in the novel (really a feeling rather than a statement) might mean that, for a middle-class woman in the USA in 1951, adulthood meant coming to terms with one's muteness. Not only were blacks and gays invisible (as Ralph Ellison so eloquently put it) but women, too, blended into the woodwork all too conveniently.PS I forgot to mention that Shirley Jackson is the greatest composer of sentences in the English language. I used to think Hemingway, but Jackson's are just as brilliant and a tad less showy-- remarkably beautiful, her sentences have the feel of a diamond cutting through glass with a clarity I thought impossible in English. I'm humbled."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/521920-robert", "userReview": "Hangsaman, originally published in 1951, has always been my favorite of Shirley Jackson's early novels. It's a strange sort of psychological study-cum-bildungsroman that has always been marketed as a suspense novel\u2014which it really isn't. Shirley Jackson has always been a hard-to-classify writer, and that's likely one of the reasons I love her. She's Her Own Thing, as so many of the best things in life happen to be. Hangsaman is an uneven book, but this somehow this works to its advantage in a weird way\u2014at times its more unwieldy passages feel right in tune with the consciousness of its troubled protagonist. The story concerns a young girl named Natalie Waite, a smart loner type who has always been under the thumb of her well-meaning but pompous, overbearing college professor father (Jackson was a master at limning windbags like him \u2013 see also Dr. Wright in The Bird's Nest). After suffering a disturbing incident at a cocktail party at her parents' house, Natalie goes off to a small private college, where she slowly begins to unravel. That sounds like a pretty basic plot, but the book is largely an internal affair. As we are constantly privy to Natalie's often half-mad musings, the story eventually develops an eerie, surreal dimension. The narrative goes especially off-kilter in the final third: like Natalie, we are often in doubt as to what is reality and what is fantasy, what is dream or nightmare; in fact, a major character introduced in this section may or may not even be real (as her fans know, Jackson consistently played with and questioned the nature of reality in her fiction). Hangsaman is an intense book that requires perhaps a bit of patience, but for the right reader it's a fascinating, thought provoking little mind trip. Extra bonus points for Francine Prose's thoughtful, engaging forward in this new edition from Penguin Books."}, {"userName": "John Pappas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5899347-john-pappas", "userReview": "Hangsaman makes the case that it is an oversight of enormous proportions that the literary reputation of Shirley Jackson rests upon a handful of (albeit, perfectly constructed) short stories. One might hope that the 2013 Penguin reprints of her novels would correct this and help begin a critical re-evaluation of her work; certainly, one can see the roots of the critically acclaimed work of Russell, Van Den Berg, Bender and others in the mystery, humor and terror of Hangsaman. This novel, not Plath's The Bell Jar, may be the ur-text of late 20th century and early 21st century psychological realism and the fantastical realism that portrays the marginalization and alienation of young females disenfranchised with contemporary social norms and experience.Here, in Hangsaman, deeply imaginative Natalie Waite tries to shrug off an indifferent alcoholic mother, a domineering and arrogant father, and a completely indifferent brother, as well as a horrifying sexual assault, by rewriting herself in college. As a first-year student, she discovers and distances herself from the catty coteries in her dorm, and struggles to find real friends to stave off her deep loneliness. Unable to master or understand the social expectations of her dormmates, she spirals into a fierce depression until she meets her soul mate-- a girl named Tony, who may or may not turn out to be real. While I'll leave the diagnosis of Natalie to the experts, I can say that Jackson's deeply sympathetic writing, even when she seems to disagree with Natalie's choices, creates a potent and ironic metaphor for the compromise of self that many women felt and feel as they grow into adulthood.

Having read We Have Always Lived in the Castle and knowing a little of Shirley Jackson's reputation, I was expecting it turn to into a Gothic melodrama or a supernatural chiller, but even four fifths of the way through, it refused to take a shape I recognised.The first part sees Natalie Waite suffering her family at home, the second sees her suffering the poisonous student/teacher relationships at her college, then the third part... well, the third part makes some unexpected jumps. Natalie makes a new friend. Heavy hints are dropped concerning the direction in which we are headed, none of which are followed through. Incidental characters may or may not exist.This is, I think, a story about identity, about a damaged person trying to understand where they fit into the world in relation to the constricting expectations of others. A key scene may be on a bus ride, when Natalie feels suffocatingly confined by her fellow passengers on all sides: \"she was helpless among people who hated her and showed it by holding her motionless until they should choose to release her.\"Perhaps now is not the time for me to be writing this review.

I vacillated between confusion (what was happening? Who was real, and who was imagined?) and boredom. This is a novel of Natalie Waite, leaving her family home for college. What seems at first to be a place of new friendships and experiences soon turns out to be etched with loneliness and madness. The blurb tells us that this novel was based on a real life disappearance of a college student in 1946. I found myself wanting to know more about the actual disappearance, rather than reading about Natalie. The prose is intentionally confusing, shifting POVs and scenes quickly, before you get a concrete sense of where you are and what's happening.

But the fact was that she used a typewriter--and then only after she had completed her household chores.\"Jackson had an abiding interest in magic, myth, and ritual. She collected grimoires and cats, and allegedly enjoyed gossip about her being a witch.* Whatever spells she used, the typewriter under the influence of Jackson's magic fingers produced spooky masterpieces, of which Hangsaman is a shining example. I feel that way about The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle too, as do all Jackson fans.Hangsaman drew me in initially with its subtle black comedy. This is a Jackson version of a coming-of-age tale featuring an eccentric but bright seventeen-year-old girl named Natalie Waite who struggles with the usual problems of late adolescence, but who has unique methods of dealing with them. As we follow Natalie through her first few months of college life, the comedy persists until about two-thirds of the way through (mostly thanks to hilarious letters sent to Natalie by her father) when it is swallowed up entirely by a sense of coming doom.\n\n The Hanged Man as depicted in the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot Deck, originally published in 1910.Natalie draws the reader slowly and inexorably into her world, as seen through her eyes. Her eyes, though! We don't know what to make of them. Is she seeing things as they truly are, or is she going mad? On the one hand, Natalie is brimming with the joy and hope of youth, anticipating a brilliant future where her genius will at last shine through and her significance as a person and (hopefully) a writer will be recognised. On the other hand, she suffers acutely from the dawning realisation that she is a social misfit, regarded with wariness by some and made use of by others, but never embraced with affection. In short, she has no friends and no prospects of friendship. It occurs to her that this might actually matter, in the long run; that perhaps a person requires friends and some kind of support to thrive in the adult world. Natalie's growing sense of displacement, paranoia, and loneliness eventually become our own. We fear for her as we might have for ourselves at her age, or for our own children when they are out in the big world, on their own.Jackson is masterful at description, pacing, and dialogue. She paints a lurid world over the placid canvas of a New England women's college campus, circa 1945-1950, but she doesn't overplay it. Jackson allows us to experience Natalie's heightened emotions and sense of expectation (always wondering will it be wonderful or terrible, the next thing that happens to me?); but these feelings are attenuated and becalmed by the light and colour and noise of the quotidian world around her. That is, until she leaves that world. About three-quarters of the way through the novel, Natalie follows a convivial pied piper out of town and, at first, we think this is a good thing. But then, typical of Jackson's writing, the reader finds herself mired in psychological horror that is only barely tolerable. This is the sort of thing O'Connor and Oates do so well too. However, I am happy to say that, unlike O'Connor or Oates, Jackson does not leave us with a dead girl in the end, but with one who steps back from the precipice in the nick of time.Rumour has it that Hangsaman is based on a story about a young college girl at Bennington who went missing in 1946, but Jackson's biographer dismisses that claim. Having read the little information we have on Paula Jean Welden, I don't see any connection except that both girls attended Bennington College and both were depressed (reportedly, in Welden's case).If, like me, you are a Shirley Jackson lover, I highly recommend this essay by Benjamin Dreyer, who explains eloquently what makes her one of the finest writers in American literature. I think this description, from an article by Sarah Weinman, is also apt: \"Shirley Jackson\u2014author of . . . a number of masterpieces in an eerie, minor key\u2014\"It's haunting, that key.\n Slack your rope, hangs-a-man, oh, slack it for a whileI think I see my father comin', ridin' many a mileOh, father, have you brought me gold, or have you paid my fee?Or have you come to see me hangin' from the gallows-tree?I have not brought you gold; I have not paid your fee;But I have come to see you hangin' from the gallows-tree.Slack your rope...I think I see my mother comin'...Oh, mother, have you brought me gold...(repeat substituting \"brother\" for mother)(repeat substituting \"sister\" for mother)(repeat substituting \"cousin\" for mother)From  miriam berg's folksong collection\n* Please note: I am linking to this article by Joan Schenkar because it makes a few interesting claims. However, I doubt the veracity of the whole piece, even though the author is a well-known playwright and biographer. It seems to me a self-congratulatory essay written at the expense of Hyman and Jackson, and it makes the dubious claim that Jackson read the essay writer's thesis while the student was at Bennington College, taking courses under Hyman (Jackson's husband and a then-famous literary critic and intellectual). The real clangor in this claim is that the author was supposedly born in 1952. Shirley Jackson died in 1965, which would have made Shenkar thirteen years old at the very most when she claims to have been a regular visitor at the Hyman-Jackson home and to have had the pleasure of Jackson complimenting her thesis."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/890233-maureen", "userReview": "awful. i love shirley jackson but this was painful to get through. i forced myself to finish it. one wonders if it was simply published as a result of the success of the lottery and the sundial (both of which are referenced on the front and back copy of my edition), in that moment where an agent or editor flush with eagerness, and says, \"you don't have anything else kicking around that we can publish now, do you?\", and a writer unwisely unveils their first \"great\" unpublished novel, and is undone. i will re-read something else by her soon, to wash the stain of this away."}, {"userName": "jacky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42679-jacky", "userReview": "My favorite Shirley Jackson book because of its mysterious nature and character development. For me, Natalie Waite was very easy to relate to in many ways, until the appearance of Toni and the downward spiral. Definitely not as creepy or scary as The Haunting of Hill House, but a great read for the amount of detail and psychological suspense. While I started my senior thesis reading The Haunting of Hill House, I eventually would up reading almost all of Shirley Jackson and settled on writing about just this one novel. My thesis investigating the women's roles of the time and the hero cycle. It makes me sad that I can't remember most of what I wrote, but it was about 8 years ago! I do remember though that almost none of the critical writing on the book discussing the rape. My cover does not look like this at all! This cover is the perfect cover for this book, whereas my cover sucks. It has a picture of a blond frightened looking girl with a noose. When discussing girl names, it was no accident that Natalie Wait's name made it on the list. Of course, Natalie Portman helped it become our final choice."}, {"userName": "SheriC (PM)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3899677-sheric-pm", "userReview": "[I realized that it\u2019s this very tendency of Natalie\u2019s to critically examine everyone and everything about her, viewing it/them as characters in a story, imagine them in other storylines, etc., that isolates her from the ability to form any kind of meaningful relationship and contributes to her crushing loneliness and downward spiral.

The plot itself isn't all that interesting, but Shirley Jackson pulls the reader into the depths of Natalie's mind and madness. In the first part, Natalie lives with her egotistical father, self-depracating mother, and indifferent brother where they host a party and she is possibly sexually assualted, but Jackson provides no answers. From the beginning, Natalie has a detective interrogating her (I suppose her own inner critic) which raises questions as to how the rest of the book unfolds. In the second part, she heads to college where she struggles to fit in with her peers and encounters a professor who reminds her of her father. Parts of it are written as letters in their correspondance and there's a bit of Natalie's secret journal in which she refers to herself in third person. In the final section, Natalie befriends Tony (who may or may not be real) and they leave the college. As strange as I found Tony's character, the final pages build into a chilling climax where Natalie's journey far away from the college parallels her inner journey where she must face herself and confront her fears. The main theme is identity which strikes in adolescence with full force. Natalie doesn't know who she is and the whole book follows her confusion and stifling self-consciousness and makes the reader identify with the uncomfortable uncertainty of being an adolescent. Jackson also hits her familiar note of persecution which is illustrated with Natalie's interactions with her peers. She grapples with loneliness and defining oneself in relation to others and by the end, Natalie has realized who she is.Hangsaman doesn't have the same brilliance as Jackson's later works, but is still a haunting read."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5114444-richard", "userReview": "If you are looking for horror in the contemporary sense, then you need to look elsewhere. It's amusing how the publishers of the early paperback (pulp) versions of this novel tried to make it look like simple suspense, and though it is suspenseful, it's not in the way most contemporary horror or mystery would be, and I'm sure many people were disappointed back in the day. This is a deeply strange, sadly ignored, work of genius by a writer who, in the early fifties, was not afraid to write something experimental and slightly puzzling. As usual, what makes it a pleasure is Jackson's pristine writing, prose so lovely and clean you can actually feel it uncluttering (that's not a word, I don't think) your brain (or maybe this is just me). There are moments, though, when the character, Natalie Waite, seems to be having what Francine Prose in the intro calls \"out of body\" experiences, and they are disorienting. This is a novel about how we see ourselves, how we can imagine that we are something else, how we can fool ourselves. As the novel progresses it becomes difficult to tell what is real, who is real, what Natalie is actually experiencing. Sometimes we're left, literally, in the dark.Weeks later, I'm still thinking about Natalie and her strange, harrowing first semester at college. I'm haunted, ready to read it again, to try and understand how Jackson did this, how she tricked me into thinking I was reading suspense, when I was really reading a novel about a creative mind breaking down, about loneliness, delusion, and existential dread."}, {"userName": "Timothy Jarvis", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27405143-timothy-jarvis", "userReview": "Staggering, harrowing, but also very funny in places.

happened? This was a combination of reading the last fifth or so, where the story takes an interesting turn, during a fit of insomnia, which helped contribute to the sense that the story had gone off the rails. However, in the couple of days since finishing it, the turn in the story has begun to seem less jarring and more haunting. (I wonder how many of the people who fired off angry letters to the New Yorker in reaction to Jackson's The Lottery found themselves pulled under its spell only a couple of days afterwards.)Hangsaman tells the story of seventeen-year-old Natalie Waite as she leaves home to start college. Natalie is smart and literate--it is unclear to what extent her own literary ambitions are the result of her father's own self-absorption--and she feels out of place at college. She is befriended by the wife of one of her professors, who was herself a student only a few years beforehand, as well as the professor himself, though Natalie is not the only student he has befriended. (And this is an all-women's college.) Finally, Natalie befriends another student, with whom she finds a special bond.Though Natalie is no Merrikat, she's an engaging protagonist, and Jackson's talent for depicting a social sphere laced with anxiety is as sharp as always. For the majority of the novel, Natalie just seems a little out of place, not sure how to maneuver the world in which she moves, lonely and alienated. And at the end, with her special friendship, there is a sense of something slipping in her relation to the world, and suddenly the novel takes on the feel of one of Ms. Jackson's short stories, where the reality of the situation is indeterminate, unnerving. It was a little jarring at first, though it does leave the book off in a very eerie place.Overall, I'd have to say I rank this below We Have Always Lived in the Castle, The Haunting of Hill House, or even the lesser-known The Sundial, but it still has some intriguing characters, sharp dialogue and wonderful writing. I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to Shirley Jackson--in fact, feeling like a bit of a Jackson completist myself, I am not sure it would be fair to recommend it to anyone not already under her spell to some extent--but it has enough of that eerie magic one can expect from her work."}, {"userName": "Alex V.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334560-alex-v", "userReview": "I think I loved this book despite not really quite understanding what happened in this book, what worlds the protagonist Natalie actually embodies and what ones are her imagination. Is she a ghost? Is everyone else? Or am I just trying to ascribe a supernatuality to a young woman's journey that is remarkably typical. It makes me think The Sixth Sense would have been so much better if the twist had never been revealed and in fact hidden completely.The college freshwoman Natalie hears voices, has imaginary friends, and a rich epistolary relationship with her otherwise distant father. The only people who really come into focus are the teacher she adores and the teacher's wife that adores her. The only thing that count are the relationships of ideas and those that dispel ideas. Everything else flies around her, free of that tether.It's a valuable book to read as the father of a daughter on the edge of her own mysteriousness, and likely as confusing to my daughter as to Natalie as to the reader."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1309716-sarah", "userReview": "[Any number of characters could be unreal, deceased, or simply mischaracterized.

The story is a simple one but the overtones are immediately present. \"Natalie Waite who was seventeen years old but who felt that she had been truly conscious only since she was about fifteen lived in an odd corner of a world of sound and sight, past the daily voices of her father and mother and their incomprehensible actions.\" In a few graphic pages, the family is before us\u2014Arnold Waite, a writer, egotistical and embittered; his wife, the complaining martyr; Bud, the younger brother who has not yet felt the need to establish his independence; and Natalie, in the nightmare of being seventeen. The Sunday afternoon cocktail party, to which Arnold Waite has invited his literary friends and neighbors, serves to etch in the details of this family's life, and to draw Natalie into the vortex. The story concentrates on the next few critical months in Natalie's life, away at college, where each experience reproduces on a larger scale the crucial failure of her emotional life at home. With a mounting tension rising from character and situation as well as the particular magic of which Miss Jackson is master, the novel proceeds inexorably to the stinging melodrama of its conclusion. The bitter cruelty of the passage from adolescence to womanhood, of a sensitive and lonely girl caught in a world not of her own devising, is a theme well suited to Miss Jackson's brilliant talent.", "title": "Hangsaman", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131177.Hangsaman", "average": 3.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1302734503l/131177.jpg", "reviews": 319, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13388.Shirley_Jackson", "name": "Shirley Jackson"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Horror", "Classics", "Gothic", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131177.Hangsaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16171283-hangsaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20362391-hangsaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18331534-hangsaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12737813-hangsaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21340465-hangsaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17791706-hangsaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1826189.Hangsaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89717.The_Haunting_of_Hill_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89724.We_Have_Always_Lived_in_the_Castle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89723.The_Lottery_and_Other_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6219656-the-lottery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131191.Life_Among_the_Savages"]}
