This one is gigantic- or rather has some large myths, which are much more than myth. I'm not sure how to go about this particular review without spoiling things, so be warned this is going to be brief. Shorter than my stack of pancakes, which is typically one sole buttermilk delight. Scattered Showers With a Chance of Daikaiju was tons of horror-pop fun, until things get a bit dicey. And if I'm being honest, the ending killed me. I am just dying now. I really need to know the next few words (preferably a whole book full, but even a sentence or two would make me happy.) If you enjoy contemporary or possibly urban fantasy with a good bit of old-school scifi thrown in, you'll love this short!4.5 stars and my thanks to the author for the review opportunity!"}, {"userName": "Cassie-la", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10214072-cassie-la", "userReview": "ORIGINALLY POSTED: https://bibliomantics.com/2016/08/28/...My favorite of the three new offerings \u2014 which isn\u2019t out until tomorrow (Aug. 29) \u2014 follows a young girl living in Japan named Etsuko. After gaining an invite to a popular girl\u2019s birthday party, Etsuko checks with her local weatherman father to learn if the party will be ruined by thunderstorms or the appearance of kaiju. While completely different in tone to the other shorts, Scattered Showers with a Chance of Daikaju is both intriguing and ultimately touching."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61317964-david", "userReview": "Monstrous funThis short story reminds me of a Godzilla movie as seen from the eyes of one of the children caught up in the mayhem.

So when Etsuko, who has never been very popular at school, is finally invited to the outdoor birthday party of one of the most popular kids at school, she is thrilled when her father is able to assure her that the weather for the weekend is blue skies with only a 5% chance of daikaiju attack the day before the party.Then the skies darken and the sirens go off as they hear the familiar screech split the air.A well crafted short story of being a child in Japan in the era of Godzilla and his ilk."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31118393-tracey", "userReview": "This was a great short story. I don't know what it is about SG Browne but I get sucked in with any story he writes. My only complaint?

This was the most different of the three stories and definitely my favourite. It is very original and the voice of the protagonist is genuine. It also has a great ending that brings the story full circle. I would definitely recommend this story!"}, {"userName": "Robb", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120948-robb", "userReview": "Hear my review on my podcast: http://www.bookedpodcast.com/?p=5406"}], "description": "Etsuko\u2019s father is the weatherman for the local Channel 8 news in Kochi, Japan, where meteorologists not only forecast the weather, they also provide warnings of possible attacks by daikaiju (giant monsters). While daikaiju warnings are frequently issued in Tokyo and other northern prefectures for the likes of Godzilla, Rodan, and Kubadon, attacks in southern Japan are rare. Still, Etsuko is concerned about the weekend weather because she\u2019s been invited to the birthday party of the most popular girl at school. The last thing Etsuko wants is for a thunderstorm or a Gigalar attack to ruin the party along with any chance she has of improving her social standing. Her father has promised Etsuko blue skies for the weekend, with less than a five percent chance of daikaiju. But much like forecasting the weather, predicting daikaiju patterns isn\u2019t an exact science. And when those blue skies turn gray and the daikaiju siren blares, Etsuko will be left with no choice but to prove her worth.", "title": "Scattered Showers with a Chance of Daikaiju", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31424727-scattered-showers-with-a-chance-of-daikaiju", "average": 4.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1470889256l/31424727.jpg", "reviews": 8, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2129854.S_G_Browne", "name": "S.G.
