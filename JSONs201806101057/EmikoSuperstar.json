It's pretty dull, but the babysitting gig pays well. But then Emiko sees a charismatic artiste called Poppy at the mall, and Poppy personally invites her to the Freak Show, held in an abandoned warehouse on Friday nights. Emiko isn't a freak. Not exactly. But could she be?  This is a tiny book that manages to cover a lot of emotional ground and pack a pretty big punch. Emiko is lonely. Her former gang of assorted geeks have all gone off to finance camp for the summer, leaving Emiko confused about whether they were \"friends\" in the first place, and needing to meet some new people. Her isolation and desire for connection lead her to take a chance and also to make some pretty questionable choices. This story really spoke to me. I related to Emiko, and I found her actions and decisions to be understandable, if not entirely supportable. Even as an adult, I could appreciate the things she finally figured out, and I admire that there are a few pretty solid messages in the story, but it doesn't feel preachy at all. My highest praise here is, I really wish Teen Me could have read this book. And I'm very saddened to discover that Minx comics only existed for about a year or two, so there are no follow-ups to this story, and very few other books from this group. :-("}, {"userName": "Colleen Venable", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61222-colleen-venable", "userReview": "I pretty much loved everything about this book, from the fantastic character designs (both in personality and in actual visual portrayal-woo for chunkier protagonists whose storyline never talks about the fact that she isn't a twig!), to the story itself which was layered in amazing ways most YA novels don't ever attempt. Thought-provoking and inspirational, not to mention being a damn fine read. A MUST READ for anyone who secretly or not so secretly is an art freak at heart. One complaint: cover is totally misrepresentational. This book is DEEP."}, {"userName": "Dov Zeller", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller", "userReview": "So often freaks and geeks are, well, social categories that get connected by an \"and.\" But in Emiko Superstar freaks and geeks are not one and the same. Of course, hours, days, even years could be spent in a debate of what distinguishes one from the other, and how these terms came to be, and how they are used in self-identification vs. other-identification. But, in this book, there is a clear (ish) delineation. Geeks are those who pursue knowledge for the sake of becoming successful at something useful. Freaks are those who pursue art-mediated experience and who try to create an existence for themselves that evades common understandings of usefulness. So, Emiko, or Emi, finds herself, a long time self-identified geek, no longer appreciating the aesthetic of the geek, and shifter her identification. It is not clear that she fully identifies as a freak, but she certainly identifies with other self-identified freaks, and finds herself falling in some way for the essence of freakdom. Or, perhaps, for a particular person, a performer who performs at a 'freak show', and who draws Emi into that world. This is not the kind of freak show where people are put on display in a way that undermines their humanity, but a place where self-proclaimed freaks perform for each other. It is inspired by similar performative events created by Andy Warhol in his art studio in the 60s.But this story is not all about performance in a public sense, but also about performance in private spaces. In relationships in particular. And it is about Emi's private world, in which she is trying to balance performances of daughter, babysitter, teenager, friend. Perhaps trying to understand whether the performance of self is different from 'being' one's self. There are many little mysteries Emi comes into contact with, which shake her world up and also build her sense of a world becoming more complicated, and therefore, whole. There is a shy but firm dignity Emi's character holds onto throughout the story that makes it unique and uniquely engaging and endearing. A beautiful story. I only wish it were a bit longer, allowed itself to simmer a bit more in its complexities. Everything resolves a bit too quickly at the end."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016128-shannon", "userReview": "I'm not picking graphic novels all that well it seems. At least not every time. It's true, I don't read the synopsis and just look at the cover and briefly flip through the book to check the artwork, so I suppose it's my own fault for picking another \"lonely emo girl finds a boy who finally 'gets' her and disappoints her parents to 'find herself' with a ragtag group of misfits.\" This wasn't as extreme in those regards as \nIvy\n was, but this actually ended up lacking substance in spite of that. I felt like I was reading three half realized ideas than one fully coherent story. There were too many characters and side stories, not enough development for any of them, and it was kind of boring to boot. I actually didn't think Emi even fit in this book; she seemed like a smart and quietly reserved character and she deserved something better than this. I would've much rather have read about her relationship with Henry or the unraveling of her employers' marriage than the loud and obnoxious characters at The Factory. Just because you're a self-proclaimed geek and don't fit in or know what to do with your life doesn't mean you have to change everything about yourself all of a sudden, and I'm really getting sick of this theme."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "If I had not first read Skim and This One Summer I might have liked this more, but this title, in the Minx series for young girls, while well written, does not have sister Jillian Tamaki as artist, which seems like the perfectly in sync collaborative team for both of them.

Fine writing of story and dialogue by Mariko Tamaki, and just okay art."}, {"userName": "Toby", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1270622-toby", "userReview": "Cybils YA Graphic Novel Award winner  I surprised myself by being engaged by this iconic YA search for identity where Emi, a self-proclaimed geek, dares to attend a Freak Show, after being captivated by its star, the Amazing Poppy Galore, at a mall. At this point in the story, the words fail and the image takes over: Poppy is full-page glorious, \"covered in silver and pieces of mirror. Like a disco ball...\" Emi dares to dream that even she could remake herself into Emiko Superstar. I noticed some interesting features of this book, both in the text and in the pictures. For one, the main character is biracial, Japanese & Canadian, without it being mentioned in the story. Also, the book is illustrated in black and white. The choice of b&w instead of color suggests a darker, sadder mood than, say, Rapunzel's Revenge, the elementary grade Cybils Graphic Novel Award winner.  I found it easy to read the text, because the symbols were clear, that is, when a character was speaking, the words were in a speech bubble whereas if a character was thinking, the words were in a text box instead. I also noticed that I was looking at the illustrations differently than I do in a picture book. I scanned the illustrations in the same way I usually scan text, since in this case, the story is told visually. I looked for evidence of development of plot, character. setting, theme and point of view, as I know that a criticism often leveled at graphic novels is that they are poor literature. Here's an example of how the graphic format enhanced the style: The narrator tells us \"The path to the stage was a black sky dotted with eyes, all looking at me\", which would have sounded cheesy if it wasn't a tiny text box, surrounded by 3 small panels of Emi, two of her worried face and one of just her nervous hands and then 11 pairs of expectant eyes. I am a reluctant reader, when it comes to graphic novels, and no wonder, since I don't know how to read them. From a pair of articles in Horn Book (Graphic Novels 101, archived online at hbook.com, March 2006), I've come to understand that reading a graphic novel entails not just traditional literacy but also what they call 'reading between the panels', that is, the reader actively participates in the text by drawing conclusions about what's happening in between the panels. Beyond this, the illustrations in graphic novels don't just illustrate the story, they can be analyzed in terms of literary elements, for example, we can be viewing a scene, literally, as the character is viewing it, thus placing us inside the story. Illustrations can also be analyzed in terms of visual elements, such as size, shape, layout and use of white space, for example, large panels grab our attention and invite careful examination, while a series of small panels suggest action and movement. As Hollis Margaret Rudiger notes in Reading Lessons: Graphic Novels 101, \"...the pictures...(don't) jut supplement the story. They (ARE) the story\"."}, {"userName": "Sarah Sammis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis", "userReview": "Emiko Superstar by Mariko Tamaki and illustrated by Steve Rolston won the YA Graphic Novel category of the Cybils earlier this year.Emiko is a geeky and awkward teenager who wants to find her place in the world. She's an Asian Canadian growing up in Toronto. The book covers her summer vacation where she is baby sitting for a dysfunctional family and spending her nights as a performance artist in a club that draws its influence from Andy Warhol's Factory.Emiko Superstar drew me into the story with the very first scene where she arrives home dressed like an escape from the Factory. She's minus a shoe and completely disheveled. She stumbles home and passes out on her messy bed. The rest of novel explains how she got to this point.The story is about taking risks and the consequences that come with taking the wrong ones. Emiko risks arrest from attending the late night events at the Factory where any number of illegal things are going on. She also risks her personal health from the lech who runs the place. She also risks grounding from her parents if they find out about her late nights.What the book does well is show a teenager's view of how the world works and the mistakes she makes with her assumptions. She's caught up with the phenomena of being popular and famous but is afraid at first to take the necessary risks to hone her skills. She's also taken in with showy attitude, being swept away with the obnoxious husband's bragging about his toys and possessions instead of seeing how manipulative he's being.Emiko though isn't a perfect angel in an imperfect world. She gets her moment of fame through lying and stealing. She gets her source material from a diary she had no business reading and certainly no business copying from. The diary though does give the novel the chance to introduce a more adult lesbian story than Skim (also by Mariko Tamaki and also a Cybils nominee). By making the lesbian side plot strictly between two adults, it gives more room to show the risks, consequences and rewards of coming out."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/608625-cathy", "userReview": "I LOVED this one! Emiko doesn't really fit into any mold and she feels out of place where ever she is, which I can totally relate to. She is labeled a nerd/geek, but she's not really, she's just uncomfortable around people. Her summer is typical. Lousy. While at the mall she has an experience that changes her life... and no, its not a sale at the Gap.I loved the story. In high school I was uncomfortable and unsure of how to act. The one thing that I loved to do was write. It was the perfect outlet for me and that's when I truly felt comfortable.The illustrations were absolutely perfect. Emiko was cute, but you could tell that she felt unsure. I loved the freckles. :)Henry is the rumpled (love interest?) and older outlet that helps her to discover where her talent really lies. He's drawn in a cute, kinda nerdy, kinda like one of the musicians in the band Reel Big Fish. (No one's going to know who I'm talking about, but it took me a million minutes to remember what band he was from so I'm adding it.)Anyway, it definitely gets my stamp of approval."}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3998684-meghan", "userReview": "The fate of the Minx imprint is really a crying shame. For an all-too-brief moment, DC Comics was publishing these fantastic narratives about teenage girls who were not even remotely the assumed norm, delivered in the form of extremely viewable and readable graphic art. Sadly, these books were published under a false imprimis (\"'Minx'? Srsly???\") and not under any other and didn't have a great fate.This is a great story about being mixed-race, about transitioning from one grade to another and not wanting to stay in the same cliques, about self-expression, about living in a world that is more complicated that you are allowed to acknowledge, and about the powers that be.

The illustrations were okay, but because of the rest of the story I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy them. I got really frustrated with the main character and I just wanted her to grow up.

I know they aren't perfect, but they go a long way for me. I like them not only because I read them nostalgically for my teenage self, who probably would have loved them, but also because I think they are just cute, interesting stories that are a nice breather from un-minx books. When I read in September that Minx is giving up the ghost, I felt genuinely bummed. I'm glad my local library carries a bunch of Minx titles so I can work through the cannon after it disappears from store shelves.Anyway, Emiko Superstar feels like a chapter of a book that wasn't written. The entire story takes place in one summer. I definitely wanted to know more about where Mariko Tamaki was bringing Emiko from, and where she was going to go post-Freak Show. There were some great subplots that could have really filled out a larger book, like the life of the suburban mom who Emi babysits for, and the character of Poppy could have her own series.

Only after a close look at the back cover did I realize that I have read another of Tamaki's graphic novels, Skim. I liked Skim, but it seemed a little light-weight and unfocused. This book definitely comes out of the same ethos as Skim. Emi is a geek who doesn't even fit in with the other geeks. She almost accidentally stumbles upon this non-conformist group of people, where each person is weirder than the last and many are performers (particularly, performance art) at the Freak Show (a sort of open-mic thing). Emi transforms herself into one of the Freaks, and starts performing too.

Well, even more invisible than I already was. Except maybe to the couple of boys I had crushes on. It wasn\u2019t until college that I became enamored of the long-defunct world of Andy Warhol and Lou Reed and dreamed of tramping around seedy NYC streets smoking too many cigarettes. The vision ended there, but it had enough aesthetic appeal to cause me to keep my hair very short and very black for quite some time. Fishnets, boots, and thrift-store clothing also figured prominently. I wanted to show all my Angst and Weirdness on the outside.Emiko, a half-Japanese, half-white Toronto high school student, takes her dreams of Freakdom one step further when she finds herself irresistibly drawn to The Factory every Friday, where Freaks reign supreme and creative souls perform art on stage (slithering through toilet seats while smeared in grape jelly, using sock puppets to dramatize a difficult mother/daughter relationship, and so on).One artist named Poppy embodies the free, creative, brave spirit that Emiko longs to possess. Emiko does finally work up the courage to perform at The Factory, but her performance is cribbed from the very personal diary of the woman for whom she babysits. Despite this rocky start and the rather abrupt demise of The Factory, Emiko has managed to jumpstart her own creativity \u2013 and finds out you don\u2019t need to be a Freak to be an artist. Emiko\u2019s attraction to these odd free spirits will be perfectly understandable to many readers, and her awkwardness and shyness are made clear by both her mumbled responses and her body-language \u2013 writer Tamaki and illustrator Rolston seem to be absolutely on the same page, making the reading of this graphic novel a smooth experience. There isn\u2019t much depth to the story or much innovation in the illustrations; compared to the truly awesome Skim, this is merely pleasant. However, it is still highly recommended for grades 8 and up \u2013 especially those Freak-wannabes out there.Some of whom grew up and became librarians, but remain full-fledged geeky Freaks on the inside."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159602-jamie", "userReview": "I didn't think I was going to like this book as much as I did when I first started reading it. The whole \"freak\" scene didn't really strike me as very convincing, but as with Mariko Tamaki's other recent graphic novel, Skim, the main character was so wonderfully realized, the trappings of the story hardly even mattered. My problem with many of the Minx titles has been that I felt they stopped short, that the growth the protagonists were experiencing wasn't given a full arc. Not so here. Emiko goes through real changes, makes mistakes and faces up to them, and ultimately, my instincts that all was not as it seemed with the Factory prove to be part of the writer's design. Tamaki is a fairly sly storyteller, actually. Her machinations are not nearly as obvious as they seem. Henry, whom one would think is going to be the expected love interest, has deeper roots in the narrative foundation than a lazier writer might give him, and I completely missed the parallels between the mother Emi babysits for and the performance artist she looks up to until the two story lines crossed over one another. Both, as it turns out, have something to teach our heroine.No one should be surprised that I am a fan of Steve Rolston's artwork. He and I go way back. This is some of the best cartooning I've seen from him. His work on his own One Bad Day is his finest hour as far as fluid storytelling is concerned, but the sheer confidence and the consistency of style in Emiko Superstar totally outranks anything he has done before. Each panel is as perfectly drawn as the ones that surround it, and his layouts are deceptively simple. He breaks the panel-grid all over the place, but with a clarity that keeps you from noticing or losing your place.Emiko Superstar is not false advertising: superbly stellar, indeed."}], "description": "A borrowed diary, a double life, and identity issues fuel a teenager's quest to find herself before she cracks and commits social suicide, in this new series written especially for girls.
