Funny. Steamy. Hot. Cute.The thing I've noticed in my reviews is that I rarely use  \"cute\" for mf books. But when it comes to MM, no matter their age, no matter how different they are, I always consider the couple to be a cute one. Maybe it's the lacking of drama, super-angst or BS that characterises the fair sex (I swear I'm not a misogynist, but women tend to be very melodramatic, especially in books).Jake and Brandon finished high school at the same time. They were so different, Jake being the school's superstar and Brandon a nerd. Life brought them together teaching at the same school they studied. They know very little of each other. Some circumstances bring them to work together and soon they start to feel things that surprise them both. They begin from understanding to lust and love. Their relationship's development is written very flawlessly. This is a \"make feel good\" book.The only issue I had with this book was the constant change of POVs. I had a hard time figuring who was who. It is a bit distracting. Usually the POVs are put into different chapters. Once you deal with that, the book becomes awesome. Another issue (my issue, not book's issue) is all the sport talking. I'm European. I don't know anything about baseball and American football [insert Jon Snow meme \"you know nothing\" here] bwahahaha We only watch soccer. I'm sure Americans are okay with all the slangs.I would have liked to read more about them. Halfway through the book I had the feeling that this was part of a series. Nevertheless this was a good read. :)"}, {"userName": "J *deep in the heart of Texas*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9072385-j-deep-in-the-heart-of-texas", "userReview": "4.5 Stars!I'm a sucker for a good sports read and this was one of the best MM sports reads I've read to date!It had a delicious slow build between Jake and Brandon, who were once classmates. Never friends but now work at their old high school together. When Brandon is forced to help Jake out coaching the baseball team they become friends and eventually more. This one was a very easy read, with little to no angst. The steam really picked up the second half but wasn't necessarily missed in the first half.

And that would have been a shame, because it's a very good book.The best thing anyone could do for newbies coming to this book would be to post a warning - \"Many unexpected POV shifts ahead; pay attention to names and be prepared. In the first nine pages, the POV shifts back and forth between the two MC's at least 10 times. Sometimes it's hard to figure out which of them a secondary character is talking to, or where the action is now and which character you are with. Without the advance warning, I went back twice trying to figure out what the hell I was reading, and finally just restarted the whole book from the beginning with careful attention to who seemed to be be on top at that moment. In the version I have, there is no warning in the formatting of POV shifts or of some sudden time shifts from one paragraph to the next. The story would abruptly be hours later without so much as a blank line in between.Were it not for these issues, this would be a five-star book. The MC's are wonderful, the dialogue is funny, believable, and at times beautifully emotional in a limited number of words that seems wholly natural to the characters. The sex is hot (very hot.) The plot makes sense and is never melodramatic. The climax is marked by a misunderstanding, but it is brief and understated and real. The resolution is sweet.The further I went in the book, the less the POV shifts bothered me, as I became used to the style. There still were tiny moments of \"Oh, that was Brandon not Jake\" but the momentum of the book carried me along. I would love to see more of these guys as they perhaps move out of the closet. And I warmly recommend this, with the warning at the top in big letters. Go into this expecting the shifts, and I think most people will highly enjoy the ride."}, {"userName": "Mandy*reads obsessively* ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4664551-mandy-reads-obsessively", "userReview": "First read in March 2011I really enjoyed this story!I can definitely recommend it, but I would have loved an epilogue! I've decided I need to reread this one, so here it goes. Update, I have decided to rate it higher a 4.45* for sure, but the ending still feels a bit rushed or incomplete.Jake was a great sports talent, unfortunately his body took a beating with all the sports and surgeries and now he is a coach at his old highschool and in constant pain from all the abuse his body took over the years.Brandon was a homeschooled nerd, that didn't start public school until he was a sophomore, he still feels socially inept and unsure around some people, jocks like Jake especially, and Jake feels a bit dim around guys like Brandon.They both had insecurities and they were both lusting after the other but sure they didn't stand a chance. Well, guess what? They certainly did stand a chance and it's the start of a great relationship. I actually liked that there is no big reveal and outing, no huge statement to make, they know if it comes out there will be difficulties but they are sure they are going to stick it it together.Misty the slightly stalker annoying hanger-on of Jake, was annoying and left a wild card at the end.I really liked this feel good story and still feel it needs a follow -up. :) ETA I bought it as an audiobook and am listening to it today!

Two lucky birds with one stone!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This book has been in my iPad for a while and eventually I figured it was time to read it (before I start with the Cut & Run series by the same two authors). A good decision - happy again, another (strong) 4-star from me.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the initial chapters there was a lot about baseball and procedures at the High School where the two main characters worked. I'm a Swedish girl - so what do I know about High School and baseball? Absolutely nothing! The lack of knowledge probably made it feel extra sluggish for me in about half the book. But then became this a delightful read. This is a romantic and very nicely told story about two very different (nah - according to them) men, just over 30 years, as both live in the \"gay-closet\". Nobody knows, and certainly not their colleagues at work.\n\"One day I'm gonna get you drunk\", Jake promised with a smirk, \"and grope you\".\n\n\n\nThe once popular sports guy Jake and the intelligent nerd Brandon \"find\" each other ten/fifteen years after High School. Jake is the former sports star from school days who, after many injuries, now become the head coach for the school's baseball team. Brandon is the guy who came back to town and now is the school science teacher. When they were young they lived in different circuits and many of the prejudices remain.\n\u2018And Brandon knew without a doupt. He was in love. Oh. Fuch. A. Duck.\u2019\nOkay, it took a while but this is a wonderful romantic m/m-story. So sweet, cute and belatedly very steamy and hot. Two passionate men to love. A nice end in the middle of their life with the feeling that these two men will solve everything for their true love is there. Well worth reading.\n... maybe not looking exactly as Jake and Brandon are described (no tattoos) - but the loving and tender feeling ...\nI LIKE - warmed my heart!"}, {"userName": "Heather C", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103725-heather-c", "userReview": "Such a sweet story!

It was really difficult to put the book down to do the ordinary things in life, because the two main characters, Jake and Brandon, are adorable and the way they fall in love was exciting.I couldn't give 5 stars because of three issues:- the point of view is changing from Jake to Brandon from paragraph to paragraph and sometimes it's difficult to understand whose thoughts we are reading;- there were many things which seemed to be left unfinished, they were not wrapped up, or they were wrapped up in a not so satisfactory way. For example, when Brandon faces Jake over his drug abuse, there's Jake's promise to deal with it in the summer, but then Jake's physical pain because of his career injuries is not even mentioned anymore;- I thought the jock/nerd theme would be more central to the story, but Brandon is not really a nerd. He's quiet, and brainy and he wears glasses, but he's also athletic, not clumsy at all, and he's a schoolgirls' heartthrob.The sport theme was not overwhelming, because the book focused mainly on the love between the protagonists. It was really fun to read, but it's like the story remains still to be told. How will Brandon and Jake be able to keep their love hidden from the community they live in? That's the main source of trouble that was just hinted at, but not really explained. It's as if the writers chose the path of least resistance.I'd easily recommend this story, but I must warn that it may be too fluffly and easy for someone. It's incredibly enjoyable though.

Yes, it is!"}, {"userName": "Garrett", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5787020-garrett", "userReview": "This book thoroughly irritated me, most of the time.

Jake reminded so much of my P. E. teacher in school who I also had a healthy respect for if not slightly overpowering and scary. Just never thought that he may have had a softer side too. I loved the way the author built up the suspension in the beginning of their relationship with both guys being unsure and second guessing themselves all the time. This would be totally natural in a situation where being gay could be construed as not an option. It is only the process of finding out bit by bit, feeling their way as to whether the feelings they're experiencing personally are also reciprocal. This would so be me too.I loved the steamy scene on the car bonnet / hood (phew!) and the ending was great too if not maybe a little abrupt. As mentioned in a previous update my knowledge and vocabulary of baseball and the US education system took a crash course with this book. Thank goodness for the built in dictionary in my Kindle.

The assistant coaches were fun. I admired how much the main characters were dedicated to the team, and to their students, and never made them play second fiddle to their developing relationship.

Let me begin with the abrupt POV shifts. I usually don't mind the third person POV switches, but this was too much to follow easily. The story was disjointed in the way that I read within a paragraph from Brandon's point of view then all of the sudden it switched to Jake and then back again. It's incredibly annoying to have to read back (in my case to listen back) some parts to try and figure out who thought/said what. This is a huge problem for character's driven story and audio-book (It's not that easy. I can't say to the narrator \u201cRepeat it again, please.\u201c). On the top of that putting distance with the MCs, from time to time, calling them 'the biology teacher' or 'the science teacher' and 'the freshman coach' did this or that, instate of just keeping 'Brandon' and 'Jake'. C'mon this is just a sweet and sexy story about two guys who went to high school together but belonged to different social groups, and how they meet again years later while teaching at the same school. I needed to relax! Okay, relax one place, tense up another. Bring me a memory of the geeky/jock/yummy high school fantasy I've ever had, 'rubbing lightly at first, slowly strengthening the grip of his fingers until the liniment is starting to soak in my skin.!'......\u201cNow!\u201dthe freshman coach said.It was frustrating, to say the least. We are also told that there is a female teacher trying to get her claws into the coach, but she goes away after an argument. Problem solved in the twinkling of an eye! Overall the writing is a bit sloppy and messy in parts. I really tried (hate when I use 'Try' word- start thinking in white) to give my best for these guys, but let's just imagine once an ordinary nonnative reader comprehend it, what would happen if any of my friends with writing skills would find out?And the last thing I would like to mention is about the audio performance. The narrator made not enough attempt to differentiate the voices of the characters and it took me over a chapter to get used to his fast reading style. Sometimes I could hear the narrator breathing and his process of salivating, which I usually don't hear that on other audio books. At around 60% there was a loud rustling of papers in the background. In addition to the previous the audio, took it a little further away from the story.All in all, I don't really like when I have to think and decipher what is being written on the page to follow along. It's obvious that this was not my game. I played much better within The Understatement of the Year and Him. Considering that this story was published in 2007 I'm so happy to see the immense improvement in MM author's characterizations and overall plot!

The authors capture the feeling of the students as well as the faculty. Interesting how Jake and Brandon have been teachers at their high school for many years without any communication between them. Almost like they were both conscientiously avoiding each other. In steps the administration. Let the games begin! The maddening slow dance that Jake and Brandon do building up to their first kiss is excruciating. Then the relief that they feel about being able to share their feelings is palpable. So good to feel their heat when they finally do kiss. And again how an they do not consumate their passion but to off to a high school baseball game????I loved how Troy walked in the house and found Jake mauling Brandon against the wall. He was so cool with it that it really bugged Brandon and Jake as well. Brandon was acting a little \"girly\" at the end due to Troy's teasing, but it was great that he was so accepting.I agree with some that the ending was a little abrupt. However Jake and Brandon have been sustaining a relationship for several months. They also have admitted they loved each other, and because of the maneuverings of that bitch Misty realized they have \"claimed\" each other.
