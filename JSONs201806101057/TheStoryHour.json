It reminded me of fairytales for adults. But Thrity Umrigar reveals far more. It is a composite of adults behaving as convoluted adults. And we pull up a chair and are in the mix of it.Let me just say that, initially, I was so drawn in by this book. Some may find the dialect of one of the main characters, Lakshmi, to be off-putting and hard to follow. And there were a few areas of dryness. But stay with it. Oh, stay with it. Thrity Umrigar implements gender, culture, caste, norms, and the like into her story arc. We observe the rawness that makes us all so human.Lakshmi is an immigrant from India who works tirelessly in her husband's restaurant and store. She is one of the shadow people whose pulse does not even register. It soon becomes too much for her and she attempts suicide. Lakshmi's case is assigned to Maggie Bose. Maggie is an African American psychologist who is married to an Indian professor. While Maggie makes attempts to keep her relationship with Lakshmi in a professional light, she soon is drawn into a friendship with Lakshmi.Both women are complex and both women are chamberlains of deep, dark secrets. The story sheds light on the deceitfulness of their lives......some forced into the open and some revealed within the willingness of a soul seeking redemption. There is an unexpected commonality between these two in spite of their diverseness. And here is where Thrity Umrigar shines.Some have questioned the open-ended conclusion of the book. And yet, our lives do reflect an on-going story that appears to never end....until we, ourselves, do in the finality of it all."}, {"userName": "Nicole~", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20071931-nicole", "userReview": "4.5/5I have always been fascinated by this intersection of gender and class--how the lives of women from the working class and the middle-class seemed at once so connected and so removed from each other. - Thrity UmrigarThe Story Hour is a compelling, close examination of the lives of two quite different women brought together under near tragic circumstances, whose progressive relationship forces them to reveal dark secrets and confront the flaws in themselves. Lakshmi Patil, a dutiful eldest daughter who practically raises her motherless younger sister, has made a ritual of self sacrifice and unwavering responsibility, is challenged by the sham of a marriage that immerses her in a deep well of guilt, isolation and unhappiness. Relocated from India to a new life in America, Lakshmi clings to memories of her homeland, but her sense of who she is, is blurred. The overwhelming loneliness of being uprooted from her native home, alienated from family and commanded by her husband never to speak to them, laboring in their restaurant or stuck in their smelly room surrounded by solitude: Lakshmi is pushed to attempted suicide.Maggie Bose, a self-assured, experienced psychologist, steadfastly keeps a professional distance from her patients, from \"So much pain. So many secrets. She felt burdened by the weight of other people's secrets, their grief, their trust, their blinking anticipation, their eager faces, the hunger with which they looked at her, expecting answers, expecting cures, expecting miracles,\" but takes pity on, and befriends the young, uneducated Indian woman whom she sees as trapped in a dismal marriage to a dominating man.As Lakshmi's and Maggie's relationship progresses, as the connective threads are inextricably sewn; detoxing, cathartic and introspective moments of confession that would normally bind more tightly a blossoming friendship, expose instead their shameful secrets and duplicity.\nYou build your 'temple of happy' on someone else's grave.\nThe Story Hour explores the fragility of a friendship shaking on a foundation of mistrust, misunderstandings, and the heartbreak that betrayal imparts; it seeks out the way to forgiveness, absolution, a second chance, that elusive miracle, hope.Umrigar sensitive tale of an Indian woman's experience torn from her native home, of class and cultural differences and perspectives, pulsate off the pages with insight and deep emotion.It wasn't difficult to be immediately pulled into the story from the very start, proving the remarkable, spellbinding gift of this storyteller to mesmerize her readers with her beautiful prose.I had my first taste of Thrity Umrigar's exquisite writing years ago through her touching novel The Space Between Us, but not quite sure why it took so long to bridge the gap to her other novels. I'll be sure not to let the hours turn to years before reading more of her work."}, {"userName": "Bonnie Brody", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630898-bonnie-brody", "userReview": "As a psychiatric clinical social worker, I found this book somewhat disturbing. Ms. Umrigar appears to know what appropriate boundaries are for professionals in my discipline. However, she has her pivotal character, a psychologist by the name of Maggie Bose, go beyond what are acceptable boundaries by any standards. It felt as though Maggie was digging a hole so deep that she could not help but fall in.Lakshmi Patil is a 32 year-old Indian woman who has come to this country after marrying a man who does not love her and she does not love. She is isolated from her family back home as her husband does not want her to have contact with them. Her English is poor and she works all the time in her husband's restaurant for no pay. Her husband is emotionally abusive to Lakshmi and his nickname for her is 'stupid'. Her best friend, in her eyes, is a regular customer in the restaurant named Bobby. When he leaves to go to California she is distraught and attempts suicide. Maggie is called in to the hospital to assist with Lakshmi's care.Maggie connects with Lakshmi on several levels and decides to take her on as a private client pro bono. From there, boundaries get blurrier and blurrier until they become more like friends rather than psychologist and client. It made me flinch as I read about the breaking of boundaries and the problems of transference and counter-transference that occurred in therapy.While I enjoyed the book as a good read, I did not like it as an indicator of my profession. Good professionals don't allow themselves to get into situations like Maggie does. They don't ask the blunt questions that Maggie asks upon meeting a new client. An example is that one of the first questions Maggie asks Lakshmi is, \"Does your husband beat you?\" This question is asked of course, but not out of the blue when a patient has not even indicated that she is willing to talk.I am a fan of Thrity Umrigar and have read all of her books. This one lives up to her others in style and readability. However, it fails in content and does a disservice to psychologists and other therapists."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3285729-amy", "userReview": "Stopped 2/3 in-- I realized I care nothing for these characters. Not only do I not care but I've learned very little about them. There's hardly any character development. It started off fairly interesting in that a therapist began treating an Indian woman who has been living in the states for six years. This therapist, Maggie, is African-American and married to an Indian man. She's also having a dispassionate affair with a white guy. She loves her husband yet keeps hooking up with this guy. She can't explain why and she's a therapist. Lakshmi and Maggie become friends but Lakshmi isn't educated and her husband's controlling. The author just didn't progress it enough. I didn't like either woman and I didn't dislike either woman enough to care what became of them. Because characters can be unlikeable and if the story and writing is there I'm in."}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica", "userReview": "2.5 stars rounded up. This is another review I thought I'd already written but then found nothing in this space, soooo...I didn't love this but it was a smidgey-bit more than ok.The story behind the story is pretty neat: Lakshmi comes to America after some family strife back in India and hopes for a better life but finds she's caught in an unhappy marriage and feels excessively lonely. She tries to kill herself. As a result, Maggie is assigned to her for therapy because Maggie has insight to Indians due to her husband hailing from that very country. Maggie, who maintains a professional distance from her clients, finds herself being drawn to Lakshmi, partially because Maggie, too, is dissatisfied with her marriage or, more accurately, bored, though also partially because Lakshmi is a clingy stalker. However, their expectations of friendship combined with cultural differences lead to misunderstandings and problems that they may or may not be willing or able to overcome. I love female friendship stories so I figured this would be right up my alley. However, Maggie is such an unlikeable character. She should be likeable, the flawed person who is trying her best, yet I couldn't connect with her because she's a twit; she makes assumptions and takes things for granted when she knows better and KNOWS she knows better and then feels some guilt for her behavior but then just slides back into being judgmental and self-serving which is weird, considering her long-time profession as a therapist. She\u2019s surrounded by overly-likeable characters such as Lakshmi, her husband, and even Peter who is horrid but still interesting.In contrast, the perfection of both Lakshmi and Maggie's husband is excessive. They\u2019re too perfect, too wonderful. Even Lakshmi\u2019s unloving husband earns sympathy. It\u2019s as if the Indian culture, terrible as it can be, only produces good people whereas the American culture, touted to be so wonderful, produces assholes, at least according to this story. Maybe. I was also put off by the stereotype that black women, in this case, Maggie, are, first and foremost, sexual creatures in that sex is the prime motivation that overrides all other impulses and beliefs. This whole story moves from women helping and empowering one another, breaking down social boundaries (though, does it really? Or is Lakshmi just a pet for Maggie and her husband?) to The Evil Things Women Do To Their Husbands When Looking For Love (In All the Wrong Places). Too much self-sacrifice on Lakshmi\u2019s part and none at all on Maggie\u2019s.If infidelity is an issue you won't read about, steer clear of this book. If a woman being all self-destructive and not being able to pull her shit together despite being 56-years-old and a licensed professional seems bothersome, don't read this book. If you don't like abrupt endings with no conclusions, don't read this book.If none of those things bother you, read this book. You may like it. Or listen to it, as I felt the audiobook had a great reader."}, {"userName": "Snotchocheez", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez", "userReview": "In her novel The Story Hour Thrity Umrigar weaves two women's stories together: one of them, a sad, engaging story of Lakshmi, a lower-caste Indian woman who is forced to marry a man she doesn't love and emigrate to the US. This story (despite Lakshmi's broken-English first-person narration, annoying at first, but develops a rhythm as the novel progresses) is by far the best of the two. The other story, of Lakshmi's clinical psychologist Maggie Bose, is hackneyed, over-familiar, and by the novel's end, completely annoying. Ms. Umrigar, with ill-advised sleight-of-hand, morphs her solid immigrant story into a run-of-the-mill marital dissatisfaction tale that might (I suppose) please Jhumpa Lahiri fans (I'm not one), but makes me want to go back and re-read Mira Jacob's refreshingly original (compared to this, anyway) multi-generational Indian immigrant novel The Sleepwalker's Guide to Dancing and forget I read this."}, {"userName": "Saleh MoonWalker", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66648866-saleh-moonwalker", "userReview": "Onvan : The Story Hour - Nevisande : Thrity Umrigar - ISBN : 006225930X - ISBN13 : 9780062259301 - Dar 336 Safhe - Saal e Chap : 2014"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/914730-karen", "userReview": "While interesting and at times moving, this book was so problematic that I can't bring myself to rate it more highly. My two main criticisms were a disbelief in the authenticity of Lakshmi's narrative voice,, and the profoundly irresponsible and disturbing messages about professional therapy.Lakshmi's broken English and creative nuances in storytelling were charming, but I simply didn't believe in her grammar and syntax. I also was baffled that she spoke to her husband in this same strange dialect -- did I miss that they didn't speak the same native language? Because if they did speak the same native language, Lakshmi would have been able to communicate with her husband fully and effectively. The author could have solved the problem of translation by using italics to show when Lakshmi was speaking in her native language.More significantly, the author's dismissiveness of the impact of Maggie's professional misconduct was a disservice to readers who might be dissuaded from seeking therapy. Maggie's ethical breaches were so concerning that she should have lost her professional license (and probably would have in the real world), as her social relationship with Lakshmi did not appear to be particularly secretive. I was especially bewildered by Maggie's perception of herself as a \"victim\" in the relationship with Lakshmi -- as if she had been betrayed -- rather than the reality that she had betrayed her client."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1548050-andrea", "userReview": "Another great book by this amazing author, this one is the story of Lakshmi, an Indian immigrant, whose marital misery and homesickness overwhelm her. After a suicide attempt, Lakshmi is counseled by Maggie, an American woman married to an Indian man. While Maggie first feels that she is only helping Lakshmi, when her own marriage faces challenges, Maggie finds her relationship with Lakshmi more important to her than she realized. My one reservation with the style of this book was the authors' decision to put Lakshmi's first person internal narrative in a sort of recreation of an Indian immigrant's heavily accented English. Obviously, Lakshmi spoke to her parents and sister in their native language, not clumsy English. And her own thoughts would not be in a language she struggles with. The recreated dialect seems disrespectful to me, as if Lakshmi's limited English mirrors a limited understanding."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8887111-denise", "userReview": "The Story Hour is a compelling story of two women: Maggie, an African American psychiatrist and Lakshmi, an Indian woman who lives in America.

More so about forgiveness than about anything else. Maggie and Lakshmi are culturally different. Both are married to Indian men, but Lakshmi is from India and Maggie is African American. After a failed suicide attempt, Lakshmi is sent to the University hospital and Maggie is assigned as her doctor. From there, an uncommon friendship begins. I don't get how people don't realize that no two people are alike. Maggie is assigned to Lakshmi simply because she is married to an Indian man. As if that makes them the same. Their husbands are as similar as night and day. Therefore their experiences are different as well. Lakshmi is hesitant with Maggie. Her husband has taught her to Never Trust the Blacks. And is even insulted when she is informed that Maggie is married to an Indian. But that common interest is what opens her up to Maggie. With Maggie's help, she becomes and open and free individual. She eventually starts her own business and her marriage begins to improve. I like Lakshmi. She really needed a friend in order to blossom into the woman that she was meant to be. Her husband I did not approve of in the beginning. But considering how their marriage came to be, I can understand his hostility. Maggie is a Psychologist, however, her life is a mess. Having been emotionally abused by her father, she is carrying on in a relationship with Peter, an old acquaintance. Maggie annoyed me. I can't believe that she is a shrink, but can't fix her own life. Sudhir is a wonderful husband, but she takes him for granted. When it comes to Lakshmi, she is clueless. She treats her as if she is talking to an American girlfriend and not an immigrant. Not that immigrants can't adapt to a new culture, but Lakshmi has been sheltered by her husband and doesn't know much of American independence. She doesn't even know the law and what she is entitled to. I really wanted Maggie to have compassion for Lakshmi. You would think that having Indian relatives would make her understanding of cultural differences, but as I said before, she was clueless. Lakshmi is the star of this novel. She is smarter than Maggie and Sudhir with all of their education.

Thrity Umrigar is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. She is just so darn good at developing authentic and memorable characters. The protagonist in this story, Lakshmi, seems so real to me that I can picture her in this room with me. Thanks to a wonderful audiobook narration by Sneha Mathan, I can hear her voice.This is the story of a poor immigrant woman from India who tries to commit suicide. She is helped and then becomes friends with her therapist (although that goes against ethical standards for the doctor/patient relationship). Maggie, the therapist, struggles with her own demons and as the story unfolds we are treated to examination of how, in our humanity, we screw up our lives so magnificently. Umrigar shows us how this tendency to get it \"all wrong\" is no respecter of class, wealth, educational attainment, sex, or race......there is plenty of opportunity for all and sometimes the most wisdom comes from the least likely sources. Overwhelmingly, the theme is forgiveness, forgiving ourselves as much as those who cannot help but disappoint us. Umrigar writes women's fiction at it's very best.

Fascinating, right?This story cuts to the core of anyone who has ever had to maintain the rules of professional objectivity while dealing with another person who cannot fathom the logic of these rules. This story reminded me of a snowball rolling down a snow covered mountain. It begins quite small, however get bigger, fatter, and fuller as it rolls along, picking up luscious snow, brittle twigs, and spiteful dirt along the way. And just when I think it's going to crash into me, it gets caught on a boulder (much bigger than itself ) and stops! It ends. I'm standing there and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Enough from me. Here is the gist in the author's elegant words:\"but in a sense, every hour of our lives is a story hour. As human beings, we think, dream, and communicate in narrative. Our stories are what define us and individualize us. Without our stories we are anonymous, faceless, a row of empty suits, hanging from a rack.

And makes you long to know when and how the next blow will land. Umrigar writes first of Lakshmi, a young Indian woman trapped in a loveless marriage in America. Then of Maggie, an older woman in a life of achievement and satisfaction. Lakshmi attempts suicide and a colleague asks Maggie, a respected, successful psychiatrist, to visit her in an attempt to get her to speak.Maggie is married to Suddhir and has been for a number of years. And she uses her connection to Indian culture to make a connection with Lakshmi. But the first visit is terribly coincidental, for Maggie would like to leave work on time to have a drink with Peter, a man to whom she is excessively attracted, but whom she has not seen in years. Peter is a visiting artist on campus where Maggie is a physician and Suddhir is a professor of mathematics and Lakshmi is...a wild card.The Story Hour tells Lakshmi's and Maggie's stories back and forth, comparing and contrasting, weaving their commonalities together tightly and highlighting their differences in stark detail. Umrigar's story is paced wonderfully, leading me to believe it was over several times before it actually ended. Her characterization is precise and perfectly balanced. She shows her readers facet after facet of each of the characters so that each is build with realism that is almost serene-- all are good, bad, wounded, angry, confident, and broken in their ways.

The story follows the lives of two women: one an African-American psychologist, and the other an East-Indian immigrant who is her patient after a suicide attempt. I love stories that contrast cultural backgrounds and particularly focus on the experience of newly arrived foreigners who are struggling to make sense of the USA. The story is complete fiction, but I can picture it happening in cities all over our country. I was very annoyed to find an obvious mistake in the book, and I hate to be picayune, but I can't help but expect better proofreading or editing from any book published by a known company (Harper) and written by an author of multiple books. Lakshmi has to take two buses to get to Maggie's house (she takes the bus from Chesterfield to downtown Cedarville and then a second one to the house) and this is a big deal because she hasn't previously used the bus system.

She also touches on infidelity issues with Maggie and what damage it does.The book smoothly moved back and forth from past to present telling about the lives of both women and how their backgrounds shaped them into the woman they were today.You will love Lakshmi just because she was a warm, caring, genuine person that you will feel sorry for but also one that you will cheer on as she struggles to overcome her shortcomings and feelings of worthlessness. Maggie on the other hand was a bit more difficult to like because she had it all and couldn't grasp how her infidelity would change things.The writing was beautiful as well as the storyline. I would recommend THE STORY HOUR for book clubs. It has many issues, situations, and meanings worth discussing. 4/5You have to read THE STORY HOUR in order to feel the full impact and the power of this marvelous book.You will be immersed in cultures, food, friendships, and determination.This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6210225-mark", "userReview": "My first sample of this author. It took a bit, but I did grow accustomed to the author writing alternating voices and with a barely-speaks=English dialect for the Lakshmi character. I enjoyed the character development, and liked the protagonist, Lakshmi, a lot. The book is worth reading, I think.I am puzzled by some of the negative reviews. One reader says they didn't like the book, because they didn't like one of the main characters. I didn't either, but think having a requirement to make all characters likable is a bit too constraining, and is unfair. How about settling for making all characters interesting and contributing to the plot, as a better standard? Another reviewer low-rated the book because a character did things a differently than a real-life professional would (I'm being purposefully vague about that so as not to spoil). Maybe the character acted differently than the reader would have, or different from an ideal professional, but I had no trouble believing a flawed human being would perhaps let compassion override their sense of professionalism sometimes.Finally, one reader, a wannabe reviewer, downgraded the book after reading only part of it. She felt the characters were not adequately developed, and didn't like how the story went. Excuse me? You didn't read it all, but it's not good, because you assume the author was going to let you down and not wrap things up adequately? Please, save us from the benefit of your future reviews. Your opinions are worse than useless, they are wrongly harmful.This is a pretty good story, and kept me engaged throughout. I will likely read others from this author because of this book."}, {"userName": "Stefanie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2107620-stefanie", "userReview": "Thrity Umrigar is probably my favorite author ... definitely in the top five. I love how she articulates the clash of cultures, the immigrant experience, and how differences are challenging but surmountable when friendship and love cross cultural boundaries. The Story Hour was a little bit disappointing, however, perhaps because my expectations were so high. As other reviewers have noted, the use of dialect in Lakshmi's chapters was incredibly distracting. I can't profess intimate knowledge of India, but the way Lakshmi's voice was written, I could not envision her as Indian ... I don't know what my brain saw her as, and therein lies the problem. There was an attempt to explain the poor grammatical structure as stemming from her lack of education, but her husband spoke the same way ... was he also uneducated? I felt like Umrigar was experimenting, trying to stretch as a writer, and unfortunately for me, it fell flat.Also as other reviewers have noted, I did not like or respect the character Maggie. She was portrayed as a caring person who liked to help people, but that goodness was buried underneath her tendency to be impatient, judgmental, unethical as a counselor, and disloyal as a spouse. I recognize the novel is essentially about human failing and forgiveness, but Maggie was uninspiring.I did think the love story of Lakshmi and her husband was brilliantly done. Lakshmi's story is what made the novel for me and reminded of Umrigar's gift for conveying how difficult it is to live in a strange land."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1650596-joyce", "userReview": "When psychiatrist Maggie, an African-American woman, begins treating Lakshmi, an Indian woman in America after Lakshmi's attempted suicide, both women's lives change. The audio is beautifully done with Mathan voicing Maggie in educated, cultured tones, and Lakshmi in cadenced broken English, at first hesitant and then more confident as she gains self-assurance. Lakshmi isn't a conventional patient who expresses her thoughts and feelings easily. Rather, she tells stories, at first about her life growing up in India--glorious tales of her bravery, intelligence, and gentle hand with an elephant who adopts the town's richest man. Thus, the sessions become story hours, with Lakshmi revealing her life and the cultural barriers she faces in the US through her stories. Enough plot. Suffice it to say that both are burdened by secrets and when these are revealed, the twists change our perceptions of the characters. Stylish, conversational language, a hopeful tone, thought-provoking, open-ended, character-centered with closely-observed, involving characters. A compelling tale that unfold at an unhurried pace. Well done."}, {"userName": "Sarah Obsesses over Books & Cookies", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2070861-sarah-obsesses-over-books-cookies", "userReview": "OH COME ON!!!!! how could it just end like that??? but it was good. SO GOOOD. The book was about two women, Maggie the therapist and an Indian woman, Lakshmi who tries to kill herself and Maggie ends up with her as a client. But soon it's clear that the two form a special bond but there's more. Maggie has her own things going on including infidelity and Lakshmi seems to be in a trapped marriage but as we observe their sessions and their individual lives everything gets complicated. I loved this book. I love a book that's good just because a person can write but also good because you recognize yourself in characters and things happen that you didn't expect and you're led expertly as things build yet the story is simple. No showing off, nothing fancy just a good story. That's what Ms. Umrigar did for me. I am a sucker for stories featuring people from far away places, different cultures etc. I love to know about their food, language customs. It was a balance of everything but most of all emotions and heart, universal stuff. But there better be a follow up cuz I was totally left hangin'."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Thrity Umrigar puts us into the worlds of these two women quite easily. Once again, she mirrors their perceptions quite well. The first half, for me, was nearly a 4 star. And when I hit the 60% mark on the Kindle read, I was anxious to see the outcomes. But somewhere right after that point, with Maggie still dallying conversations with Peter at the same time as some of her \"ah-ha\" moments, I just lost connection. The rest was nearly a 2 star for me. There are other Thrity Umrigar I have enjoyed all the way until the end. Maybe my expectations after \"The Space Between Us\" were too high?The young Indian-American woman half of the narration was excellent. Maggie's role and deductions and professional judgments too, connections for me were almost nil. Too smart with no wisdom? Something like that, but reading her onus was blech! But the dialect and characterizations of the Indian characters, women and men, were excellent."}], "description": "From the critically beloved, bestselling author of The World We Found and The Space Between Us, whom the New York Times Book Review calls a \"perceptive and . . . piercing writer,\" comes a profound, heartbreakingly honest novel about friendship, family, secrets, forgiveness, and second chancesAn experienced psychologist, Maggie carefully maintains emotional distance from her patients. But when she meets a young Indian woman who tried to kill herself, her professional detachment disintegrates. Cut off from her family in India, Lakshmi is desperately lonely and trapped in a loveless marriage to a domineering man who limits her world to their small restaurant and grocery store.Moved by her plight, Maggie treats Lakshmi in her home office for free, quickly realizing that the despondent woman doesn't need a shrink; she needs a friend. Determined to empower Lakshmi as a woman who feels valued in her own right, Maggie abandons protocol, and soon doctor and patient have become close friends.But while their relationship is deeply affectionate, it is also warped by conflicting expectations. When Maggie and Lakshmi open up and share long-buried secrets, the revelations will jeopardize their close bond, shake their faith in each other, and force them to confront painful choices.", "title": "The Story Hour", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22138382-the-story-hour", "average": 3.85, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435001882l/22138382.jpg", "reviews": 923, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/127875.Thrity_Umrigar", "name": "Thrity Umrigar"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Contemporary", "Adult Fiction", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22138382-the-story-hour", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19144598-the-story-hour", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18945719-the-story-hour", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22678561-the-story-hour", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218357.The_Space_Between_Us", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7107515-the-world-we-found", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3429253-the-weight-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32051571-everybody-s-son", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218356.If_Today_Be_Sweet"]}
