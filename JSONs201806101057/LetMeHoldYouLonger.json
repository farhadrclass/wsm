The illustration by Mary Collier provide a lighthearted portrayal of everyday family life .... pictures we can all relate to. You and your children of all ages will smile, laugh, and maybe even shed a tear over them together. Let Me Hold You Longer is a heartwarming reminder of the precious process of growing up and the joys of watching it happen.Quote:The last time when I shout that yes, your room is still a mess.The last time that you need me for a ride from here to there.The last time that you spend the night with your old tattered bear.Let me hold on longer, God, to every precious last."}, {"userName": "booklady", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady", "userReview": "Incredibly sweet story written by a mother of six which reminds all parents to treasure each moment we spend with our children. As parents, we are usually so good about recording 'firsts', i.e., first tooth, step, word, grade, soccer goal, car, etc., but we often forget to notice 'lasts': last bottle, nap, bouquet of dandelions, sticky kiss, bed-time story, camp-out . . . all those little joys of childhood which are what make being a mother--or a father--the best job in the world and are over before we know it. Karen Kingsbury puts the question to us, \"What would you do if you knew this was going to be the last time your child did ______?\"And yet, despite the title, it's not about holding on to our children, just about cherishing what we hold now, realizing how quickly the present slips away. For a real treat, listen to the author read the poem-story aloud and tell about the inspiration behind it in this short YouTube clip."}, {"userName": "Jeanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5130755-jeanie", "userReview": "Remembering your last with your child.

Let Me Hold You Longer is a story about the precious moments we have in life. This story is told from the perspective of a mom who thinks about the lifetime of her sons lasts. It begins from the very beginning when he is born to when he heads off to college. Some examples of the lasts are the the last time you wore your faded baseball cap, last bat at little league, last piano lesson and the last time you were your high school football jersey. This our just a few of the examples that are throughout the book. This book is a precious story that is happy and sad all at once. As I read it I think about the many lasts that I had in my life and realize how quickly life goes by. We need to truly make the most of every minute and to cherish the times with out families. Also the artistry throughout was wonderful; very clean and crisp. I think that this would be good for students and parents, its a reminder of the joy of growing up and the experience the parents have of watching it."}, {"userName": "Kelsie Hutton", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76445022-kelsie-hutton", "userReview": "This book is overall a good book that has to do with growing up. The book message is a good one for kids who do not always necessarily realize how fast life actually goes by. The book teaches or highlights how as you grow there are things that you will do for the last time. For example, the last time sleeping in a crib, the last time you hit a ball off of a tee, or the last time you go to high school. The thing I did not particularly like all that much about this book, is the art. The art sort of loses a disconnect with the children because it looks dark, is plain, and does not necessarily look like the art of a children's book."}, {"userName": "Lexi Jones", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70928734-lexi-jones", "userReview": "This is a very sentimental book about a mother reflecting on all of the moments in her children's lives that will mark the last time that they do various childhood activities. It is a very sweet book, but I feel like it is geared more toward parents than children. However, I do think that a child would still enjoy it because of the fun illustrations that help tell the story. This is a book that I probably wouldn't highlight in a classroom because of the nature of the theme. This just seems like a book that would be good for a mom to read with her kids."}, {"userName": "Mara Rhodes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76565974-mara-rhodes", "userReview": "This book looks at life and how we start as kids, getting help from our parents, and eventually, the tables have turned and we are taking care of our parents. 3 topic ideas: Family - Healthy relationships, love Rhyme Growing up, responsibility"}, {"userName": "Donna Mork", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51567356-donna-mork", "userReview": "Absolutely beautiful book about the lasts in a person's life.

This book touches on life's precious moments- starting in infancy and developing through various achievements that a child may accomplish. Kingsbury, through simple poetic writing, reminds parents to not only celebrates the \"firsts\" in a child's life but celebrate and hold on to the \"lasts\". Kingsbury has a special way with words and this book is no exception. She emphasizes the theme of holding onto your child(ren), as made evident by the title of the book, cherishing the moments that you don't realize are the \"lasts\". I am not a parent so I can only imagine how touching this picture book might be for parents watching their children navigate their way through life. I thought this book was sweet however, I'm not sure if I would place it in my classroom library. As elementary school students, they may not fully grasp the concept of how important their accomplishments are to their parents. It would be interesting to have each child bring the book home for a day or two and to have the student come back and tell their classmates the reaction their parents had to this book."}, {"userName": "Kami Adams", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46466884-kami-adams", "userReview": "This book is great for the classroom, and it makes you really thankful for your mom. It is about this mom who starts out by holding her baby and thinking about the future things that she will get to see her child do and not know if it is her last. She talks about rocking him to sleep, telling him to clean his room, watching him play baseball and going off to college. She says in the end \"Let me hold on longer, God, to every precious last.

As her son grows up, the mother realizes just how fast he is growing, and wants to cherish each moment while she can. Her son goes through school and various phases of life, but at the end, he leaves for college. It is then that his mother is hit with reality and starts to reminisce about all of the precious moments when her son was still a little boy. I really liked this book! The story was very sweet, and it made me realize how true it is. As a college student, I find myself sometimes looking back on moments from high school and my childhood that really stood out to me. It made me realize how hard it is for mothers to send their children away to college when they still see them as their \"little boy\" or \"little girl\".I could use this book in a classroom because the students would be able to relate to it very well. Every child experiences growing up, and every parent experiences seeing their child grow up; so it would be a good book to read about family and how family is a precious thing in life."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51698914-kathryn", "userReview": "This book is from a mother's point of view. She speaks in rhymes, talking about looking towards the future of her son's possible \"lasts\" in their relationship. She goes through the years all the way to his last day at home when he leaves for college.I really loved this book. It gave me chills and almost made me cry, just because it made me realize how time has flown in my life and I remember from my childhood all of those times that the mother mentions about his childhood. I don't have children, but I can imagine how touching and emotional this could make a parent feel, especially a mother. It reminds us that time flies by and each moment is special and should not be taken for granted.

Whether its for a child who is growing up, going through the motions of change, or an adult who is watching their child grow up everyday, missing the things that one day will be gone. This book talks about a mother recognizing all the last things she will be doing, from birth to adulthood, when her son moves out and goes to college. My mother had bought me and my older brother this book for Christmas, and the first time I read it, it brought tears to my eyes. Growing up is difficult, and often it happens way to fast. This book does a lovely job to remind readers to value on the little things before they are gone. Love Love Love this book, great book for anyone."}, {"userName": "Mandy J.

It is poignant and appealing for that purpose. I can see it appealing to a very young child for the visuals and the lyrical, rhyming text, but most children beyond toddlers will not \"get it\" and might even have reactions of anxiety and/or irritability. Trying to think back to my own childhood, I feel it might have been seen as somewhat clinging.
