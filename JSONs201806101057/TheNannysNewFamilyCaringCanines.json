From grief and guilt, to the fear of being different from others, the characters in this enjoyable story must work through a lot.I thought that the four children were very realistic, especially since they have gone through two deaths in the family in the past two years. Each child was handling life the best way they knew how. Annie and Ian were also very believable. Annie had a lot of training and experience with children and that showed in the way she was able to break through to these kids.I appreciated that there was so much depth to each person in this story. Even though Annie is great with the kids, she has her own internal struggles that she is dealing with. Ian is a nice character, too. His dedication to doing anything necessary to help his kids was admirable and he was just an all around good guy.This is another great addition to the Caring Canines series. It is the fourth book in the series, but can be read as a stand-alone.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.You can read this review on my blog at:https://brittreadsfiction.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Jasmine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14933619-jasmine", "userReview": "A family + a nanny + a dog = LOVEA sweet story of family, forgiveness, and finding home. I've really come to enjoy \nMargaret Daley's\n Caring Canines series, could be because I am a softie for good dog stories. The Nanny's New Family was such an enjoyable read. You gotta admire a girl that uses the tragedy in her past to help her reach hurting families, especially the kids. Add a good-looking guy, 4 kids, a dog, some heartache, and love, and you get a great read. Six hurting people find out that family is all they really need....family and faith...I am continually amazed at how much of a story can be packed into the slim, little Love Inspired books. They are just the perfect size, for carrying with you, for snatching a couple hours of good reading. The Nanny's New Family fits that description perfectly.The Nanny's New Family is sure to win the hearts of \nMargaret Daley\n fans and dog lovers.(I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for my review.

Most people know how loyal a companion a dog can be, but Ms. Daley has opened my eyes as to how a dog can be much more than just a pet. Usually the cover is what draws me to a book and this one just reached out to my heart. It's both inviting and sweet. The back cover gives us a glimpse at what the story is about. This is such a sweet story. We are introduced to two troubled souls in Annie Knight and Ian McGregor. I was immediately drawn to Annie and her compassion. She wants to help children in difficult situations and she is very good at her job.  Ian's life has been turned upside down. 2 years ago his wife passed away leaving him raise their 4 children alone. Luckily his aunt moved in to help and six months ago she passed away. Needless to say his house and life have been gradually on a downward spiral. He and his family need stability, organization and direction. Annie is hired as the new nanny, but as she steps in to get the family organized, of course this doesn't come easily or as quickly as she had imagined. This story is laced with heart break, humor and a good romance. I loved it!The characters will definitely pull you in, but the storyline will keep you turning the pages until the end. This is a good, clean story. I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Ms. Daley and Love Inspired for gifting me with this book for a honest review without bias."}, {"userName": "Valri Western", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5027880-valri-western", "userReview": "I have enjoyed each story in this series regarding service dogs but each book could be read as a stand alone. This book was perhaps my favorite. With a dog on the cover, you know it's going to be central to the story! I loved learning more about the amazing things service dogs do in each of the author's books. Ian is a plastic surgeon who has 4 active children but needs a nanny for them desperately. He lost his wife 2 years previously and has barely been holding things together. Annie has had a heavy burden to bear in her life due to an event that happened as a teenager and she's become a nanny to try to make up for what she mistakenly perceives as her fault in that event. As these two troubled souls work together to help the 4 children who need a happy home again, they find that forgiveness for themselves is becoming more important. The children test the boundaries of discipline, like all children do, but come to love Annie and her extended family. Annie doesn't think she can be loved for herself because of what happened when she was a teenager but Ian shows her that it's possible. When a health crisis happens to one of the children, Annie shows Ian that a service dog would solve the problem and opens up a whole new world for the family. I enjoyed all parts of this book! The characters deal with real issues and feelings. I would highly recommend it!*** I received this book from the author for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24620927-michelle", "userReview": "Caring CaninesBook 4This has been such a great series! Except for the third book, which I didn't care for, they have all been full of romance and emotional moments. In this book, we have many leading characters:Annie Knight: She has a degree in psychology, but her life's dream is to be a nanny. Guilt-ridden with events that happened fourteen years ago, she feels her deformities are her punishment. She'll never marry since no man will want her.Dr. Ian McGregor: He is a plastic surgeon who is also widowed and raising four kids of his own. His oldest in nine and is about to face a life-changing medical condition. His eight year old twin daughters are identical physically, but different as night and day on the inside. His youngest is four and causes all kinds of havoc in the household with his wrecklessness and disobedience.The author did such an great job on developing the character of each of these characters. I was so into the story I could hardly put the book down. Reading about the development of each character, the romance, and watching everything come together in the end was exciting! Margaret Daley did such an excellent job on this entire series, and this book thrilled me.There are many hard issues covered. I like how each character reacted realistically to the issues that effected them. And I really liked the fact that these children were normal kids who fought, talked ugly to each other, and disobeyed. Just wonderful!"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10318483-carol", "userReview": "This is the 4th installment in the Caring Canine series.

His wife died unexpectedly two years earlier and he is struggling with some very heavy burdens of his own. As part of the Caring Canines Series, and with a dog pictured on the front cover, you know there has to be a dog involved. If you are not familiar with what service dogs can do, it\u2019s worth reading the book to learn about these amazing animals. The book is inspirational with a dose of romance and a bit of suspense at times. With four children ranging in age from five to ten, including twin eight-year-old girls, there\u2019s no way to avoid some suspense. I recommend it as a book that helps the reader get a new look at the need and importance of forgiveness in our lives. The reader will start picking up on the need for forgiveness in several of the characters from early in the book. The author does a great job of conveying this through the story.
