Book 1, Extracted, had some crazy, non-stop action. Book 2 is a non-stop adrenaline rush.This is not a stand-alone novel, you'll want to read Extracted before reading this one. But you will not be sorry you invested the time. Heart stopping scene after scene move this mind-bending plot along at a furious pace.Oh? You like character driven plots instead? No worries, you WILL fall in love with each and every one of these individual, unique characters. They will engage you at first meeting and wrap you around their little finger (one way or another). ;-)My only complaint is that it's over. NO NO, not the story, but I did finish book 2. I really wanted it to go on and on and on. Of course, part of that was wanting to continue listening to Carl Prekopp's excellent narration. Carl brings this story to life in your car, living room, jogging trail, or any location of your choosing.If you like techno-thrillers like I do, don't miss out on this series."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6143501-kim", "userReview": "I laid lots of praise on\u00a0Extracted, the first book in this time travel trilogy. It offered an interesting time travel concept: The creation of a time travel machine seems to have created an apocalyptic future, so three heroic figures are brought out of their timelines at the point of their deaths to alter the outcome. The three characters are a WWII commando, an insurance investigator who single-handedly stopped a terrorist bombing on the London underground, and a special officer who saved England's prime minister by wiping out terrorists raiding 10 Downing Street by herself.The first book was great, so I was happily surprised that book two was even better. \"Mad\" Harry Madden, Ben Ryder, and Safa Patel were fully developed characters working together (with Ryder dragging his feet) to train for an important mission in the future. At the end of the first book an elderly woman appears at their secret bunker, grabs an apple, and enters the common area simply introducing herself as their new boss.In book two we learn this woman is Miri, one of the greatest spymasters of the mid-20th century. She, too, is snatched from the past at moments before her historic death and arrives to coordinate the team and run the operation. She also adds a whole new psychological wrinkle to the gradually congealing team. Miri is a master of observation and manipulation, and she works with full dedication to the success of whatever task she takes on, no matter the eventual body count.\u00a0This volume also expands on the bits of humor in the first book, with Miri adding an interesting perspective on their whole operation and a funny and tender love relationship between Ben and Safa.\u00a0In this book we learn that the apocalyptic moment isn't that far in the future. The British special forces have been assigned to find the time machine. The government has learned from shared intelligence with the US and others that the machine has been built and the US is pushing the British government to seize it. What becomes clear is that the intelligence powers from the US are so determined that the machine is a danger they're willing to drop nuclear weapons on the UK if they can't capture the machine. This escalates into various powers sending nuclear weapons to other countries. Miri manages to design an operation that sends the team to protect the machine's inventor and his research and eventually a series of jumps to every nuclear capitol to halt the war.Heywood's action writing is phenomenal and the humor in the calmer moments is handled well. The three-dimensional characters of the first book come alive even more and Miri is an excellent, if often enigmatic, new character. \u00a0My main complaint now is having to wait around for volume three."}, {"userName": "T", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8845752-t", "userReview": "i love this series.

And who could resist such an elaborate dialogue:\u2018Movie good?\u2019 she asks Harry.\u2018Aye.\u2019\u2018Good.\u2019\u2018Seen it?\u2019\u2018No.\u2019\u2018Should.\u2019 'Will.\u2019On the downside, the action scenes are even more drawn out than in the first part, and reading the fifth page about the assault on the Cavendish Mansion definitely takes away the intensity of the action.There is not much character development, unless you consider referring to some features again and again (Safa's physical perfection and leadership, Ben's intelligence, Harry's quiet strength) \"development\". The new Miri character is extremely unpleasant, and there is nothing to really justify her exaggeratedly curt style and continuous cryptic allusions to sophisticated \"game\" that requires multi-stage strategies (The application of force to create pressure. Create an environment for a bond to grow. Water the seeds and study the results.). As a result, the finale of the second instalment felt anticlimactic after all the build-up.Perhaps it all comes together in the third instalment, so I guess I want to read it.

You have an extremely intelligent insurance investigator, a brutally honest beautiful leader, a war machine, a rogue intelligence operative, and essentially an aging super spy. That's without getting into the supporting characters. All these characters were masterfully development and show that the author has a knack for engineering chemistry between his characters where its seemingly impossible. Then you have the action sequences that are phenomenal. Couple that with a realistic interpretation of science fiction that is explained so simp!y it makes you say, \"Well I could write that.\" But has seemingly never been explained in that way.

It is not 'Executed 2'.It is purported to be the second book in a trilogy that began with \"Extracted\".I have read them both. I could not issue a review of \"Extracted\" as it did not resonate as being a complete book. I now know why. The Extracted/Executed publications actually comprise only 1 book. If there is another book, it will merely be more adventures of the time travelers to see if the world is obeying their orders to case and desist.Haywood has a deft approach to character development but if he exaggerates it, as he does here by playing it out over two publications, it can become tedious. Safa, for one is over cooked. She is an obtuse and fascinating character, or caricature, with scars over scars to hide the wounds that all of the men in her life have seen fit to inflict, perhaps because of her unparalleled beauty and capabilities. Haywood is not a misogynist, he just enjoys developing his female characters to a greater depth and detail than his male characters.The story line is compelling and his way of keeping important facts behind his curtain is intriguing when it isn't annoying. His teasers are often unnecessary and it seems like he is insecure that the reader will continue reading without them. At best they are contrived and at worst they are trite.The decision to split the story into 2 books may not have been Haywood's. It could have been a great book. His character Miri is superb. She gets a 2nd chance at her swan song and is determined not to mess it up a second time.Although I doubt that there will be a third entry in this series, I must also say that his abrupt ending to \"Executed\" was so dissimilar to his approach on any other subject addressed in these 2 books that I have the feeling that someone, if not Haywood, cut it off a lot before the chapter was finished.So for those readers that are new to Haywood, as I was, I suggest that you read the 2 books end to end as one story before considering a review."}, {"userName": "Alex Ball", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70108770-alex-ball", "userReview": "The concept behind this series has been quite good however it is let down by poor writing. That being said, the writing is considerably better than the first book and so if you were put off by that but want to continue the story, this is a marked improvement. The problem is not the characters, who are vivid and full of personality. The problem continues to mainly be the poor dialogue and lazy writing.The dialogue, while again much improved from the first book, continues to feel lazy and unnatural. There's a ridiculous amount of repetition (\"Is it?\", \"It is\", \"Oh it is?\" \"Yes it is\" for example) and an almost comedically bad amount of swearing. I don't mind bad language at all. I use enough of it myself after all. However, it continues to be used in place of actual dialogue. I get that Safas character necessitates her having a limited vocabulary, mainly consisting of four-letter words but sometimes it can grate beyond enjoyment.The lazy writing is a continuing problem from the first book. Scenes are described purposely vaguely to try and create a sense of mystery however it rapidly becomes a source of irritation. Likewise, in scenes where a number of characters are being described, the scene can be lost with an overabundance of pronoun usage rather than naming the characters directly. When 3 male characters are in the scene, I don't know which character is being talked about when the pronoun \"he\" is used to describe one of their actions. There is more I can complain about with the narrative, however, I shan't for the sake of avoiding spoiler content.If you've read the first book, it's worth continuing. If you read the first book and decided it was badly written and didn't want to continue, it is a big improvement over the first book and is worth continuing. If you're reading these reviews trying to decide whether to start the series or not.... well I would simply say that there are better sci-fi series around."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12809624-mark", "userReview": "Exciting.

Miri is frustrating, and I suspect that that\u2019s the point.I\u2019m not sure how the developmental process was with this second book, but it seemed like they decided to just wipe the slate clean and insert the characters from book one into a new story. Many of the dynamics were rewritten, and a new character other than Miri is introduced, and she is ssllooww!! I figured it out early in the book. The other characters figured it out in the middle of the book. Why the heck doesn\u2019t the new character figure it out until the last chapters? (Intentionally vague because, spoilers!)The excruciatingly long chapter structure is gone from the first book. All my complaints and praises from the first book carry over to the second.

I'm not a prude, but it just left me a little bored and feeling like skipping forward. I also really disliked Miri and Ben listening to a couple having sex just in case they let spill a secret in the heat of the moment. It seemed unnecessary for more than one person to do this, if it was even necessary for any of them to do so at all, which I doubt.There was again a little too much of a Rocky training montage before the story actually progressed, but once it did, it was good fun and I want to know what happens next, which is a good sign.I am quite prepared to throw a hissy fit if the team don't pony up and save Malc and Konrad soon, though. I'm very disappointed with Ben, Harry and Safa for not trying to save them sooner.

I am reminded a bit of Crichton - not only because of the subject matter, but also in the meticulous research that must have been done. But while Crichton's research is in theories that would make the science fiction plausible, Haywood has done what it takes to make the characters plausible. Several times in his books Haywood has depicted emotions and experiences in such vivid and clear detail that I was almost uncomfortable in their veracity. It's just little things here and there, but I appreciate that. I also appreciate that, at least in the Executed series, the pacing is so different compared to modern novels. Sure, there are bits of action here and there, but the determined way at which the novel builds towards its climax reminds me more of a Jack Aubrey adventure than a contemporary fiction. Sure, the conflict is hinted at early on, but the reader isn't hit over the head with reminders as to what is happening and why.
