As part of a marketing approach to launching a new series, this book places Stephanie in a most unusual place right around Christmastime. As she's trying to get her life on track, a man materializes in her apartment. She can't figure out how he got in and starts wondering if he's a vision or a ghost. It's Diesel... a very hot man... just what she needs, a third one in her life... and he desperately needs her help. Convinced she's losing her mind, Stephanie tries to ignore him but ultimately realizes the only way to lose him, is to help him find the toy maker who has disappeared right before Christmas. Suddenly, she freaks out when she thinks he means Santa Claus! A very cute story, full of the normal charm in Evanovich's books... it's a good laugh. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy these in between books for exactly what they are - humor, romance and a bit of mystery!\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

After reading the first chapter, I knew I'd hate it!Not only did the story seem excessivly rushed, with countless scenes being skimmed over with no detail whatsoever, but the charaters alone were basic and uninteresting. The plot alone was horrible, with a somehow supernatural dude popping into the main character, Stephenie's, life without an explanation whatsoever. The supernatural aspects of the book were not explained at all, to any degree, and the entire status of the relationship between Steph and Desiel (the male lead in the novel) was ignored throughout the book, even to the end. The ending of the novel was entirely rushed, probably more so than the entire book as a whole.The only brightspot to the book was the occasionally comical sarcastic thoughts and dialogue expressed by the main character. Even this bright spot was few-and-far between, so I can say quiet easily I did NOT enjoy this book, at all"}, {"userName": "Kourtney", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/233016-kourtney", "userReview": "I got impatient waiting for the next Stephanie Plum book to come out so I thought I would go back and read one of the books released in between. Normally I like these books because they make me laugh, they are quick reads and the characters are well developed. This book made me laugh and was a quick read; however, it felt rushed and not fully developed. All of a sudden it just ended. It also involved a character that is in some of her later novels but the events that happened in this book are never mentioned again. As though we would forget those 200 pages ever happened.

These books are trite, cliched and just plain uninteresting. I don't have any idea why Diesel was dropped into the story with a silly \"supernatural\" element and honestly, how many times can we hear about the hamster in his hamster wheel and how Stephanie's car blew up yet again.

I'll start with the story. It was an ok story although the addition of a supernatural element was more than a little strange in what has been a reality-ish based series for the 8 previous books. And the addition of yet another man that's attracted to Stephanie is becoming ridiculous. I mean every hot man that enters the series becomes a potential love interest. Doesn't she ever have men that she thinks are hot that don't want to sleep with her too? I think it will be interesting to see how much of this book will continue into the regular series.My biggest was with the narration. It's like changing an actor mid-series. Like the two Becky's on Roseanne. Sarah Chalke is a great actor but she wasn't Becky. That's how I felt about Lorelei King. I've listened to 7 books read by CJ Critt, so her characterizations are familiar. Her Joe, her Lula, even her Stephanie were different, but not bad. But Kloughn and Grandma Mazur were the worst. They were so different it was jarring.On to book 9. There's an option for CJ Critt or Lorelei King for the next 2 books, and I'm hanging on desperately to Critt."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5059710-elizabeth", "userReview": "[at the end, we learn that one of Valerie's kids will grow up to be a supernatural superpowered superhero, too, (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25664087-tracy", "userReview": "This is the first story in the series where we are introduced to Diesel.

Well , as I was reading the Christmas Novella of the Stephanie Plum adventures and to my surprise the author Janet Evanovich had introduced a supernatural character named Diesel and I was like OMG thats Diesel from her latest series Wicked Appetite and Wicked Business. As we are also used to strange men popping up in Stephanie Plum's novel , at first she doesn't blink but soon she will realise that there is something not out of this world right with her newfound guest Diesel. He has somehow been transported into Stephanie's apartment building as it seems that two supernatural characters have gone walkabouts . As the novel goes along we read as the characters Diesel is looking for matches her bail FTA and the pair of them join forces. Will Joe and Ranger be supportive of a new hunky male encroaching on their Stephanie time ? Can Diesel help Stephanie to embrace the cheerfulness of Christmas Spirit ? One of my favourite parts as always was Grandma Mazur's reference to wrestlers like Kurt Angle and Lance Storm as I was like - I know those names haha. The downside was I would have preferred a couple of scenes of Ranger and Diesel sizing each other up and Lula and Connie comparing the duo.Another fun loving and quick easy to read book in the Stephanie Plum Series and when I say quick it only took me 1hr to read on my lunchbreak at work."}, {"userName": "Corie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2129324-corie", "userReview": "3.5 Stars Really, NOT 3.I LOVE to read most all things... Supernatural, Paranormal, Preternatural,... just \"Other\" in general. Even some sci-fy, distopian and fantasy.

The Stephanie Plum Books are some of those \"Non-Other\" books that I love.This Stephanie Between the Numbers has crossed over a bit and I can't decide if I'm thrilled with the mix. Somehow \"Other\" in Stephanie's world just doesn't seem to fit to me. But I always enjoy Janet Evanovich's crazy cast of characters. And true to form, this book has its laugh out loud moments. I liked that it wasn't totally wrapped up in Joe and Ranger, and instead Diesel was a nice twist, he was awesome.This Stephanie Book, had one two of the most emotional scenese I ever felt with this series, both including Stephanie's niece Mary-Alice. Short scenes, but had me all choked up none-the-less. Maybe it was the clever scene, or the idea of kids growing out of believing in Santa or just plain hormones. Whatever.

It wasn't up to Evanovich's usual standard of humor and entertainment, although there were flashes of her style from time to time. I'd probably rate it 2.5 stars, but because all the usual characters were there with the addition of Diesel (from the Lizzy & Diesel series), I'll round it up for GR. In this case, Stephanie is trying to find Sandy Claws, a skip who seems to be running a toy shop just before Christmas, hiring a number of little people to work for him, with a wife who is constantly baking cookies. The book is certainly a light and quick read, but it's almost too light. By that I mean that it seems like a short story that was written to emulate Evanovich, copying all of her signature humor with none of the warmth that is usually there. It seemed much too fluffy.

She doesn't have a tree and she hasn't bought any presents. She also has work to do as a bounty hunter; she has to find toy maker Sandy Claws who has skipped bail. The last thing she needs is complications but that's just what happens when sexy stranger Diesel literally appears out of nowhere in her kitchen. Diesel is vague as to where he came from and how he managed to pop into Stephanie's apartment, but he's a man on a mission and sticks by Stephanie's side until he figures out what that mission is. When Stephanie isn't preoccupied with Diesel and trying to catch Sandy Claws, she's dealing with family issues. Her niece Mary Alice doesn't believe in Santa, her sister Valerie has startling news, and her Grandma Mazur has a new stud muffin. At this point, Stephanie wonders if she'll ever get a Christmas tree and her Christmas shopping done!\"Visions of Sugar Plums\" is a fun, if light read. Most of the old familiar characters are included: Joe Morelli, Stephanie's parents, Grandma Mazur, Valerie and her daughters, and Albert Kloughn. However, fans may be disappointed that there's no Ranger in the book. Lula doesn't appear until near the end of the book, but has some very funny scenes, especially when she \"finds\" a parking spot at the mall. Diesel adds a bit of fantasy that's a nice touch in a book that takes place in a season that's often filled with fantasy. Everyone, including Stephanie, accepts Diesel's sudden appearance. To me that was the only of-note, especially the way Morelli quickly decides that Diesel isn't a threat to his relationship with Stephanie. I groaned a bit when Stephanie was looking for someone named Sandy Claws at Christmas time since I thought that was overly clever but I changed my mind as the story started rolling along. Sandy Claws and his \"elf\" helpers added much humor to the book. In fact, the book is full of humorous incidents ranging from a food fight to Stephanie buying a Christmas tree (over and over again), the elves, and, of course, Stephanie's car being blown up. The book is worth reading just for the extremely funny take on the poem \"`Twas the Night Before Christmas\". While the book is long on humor and a bit short on plot, the resolution of the plot line with Grandma Mazur's stud muffin is quite a surprise and well done.\"Visions of Sugar Plums\" is a light but very funny book to read."}, {"userName": "Kathy Davie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4222001-kathy-davie", "userReview": "First recorded read was August 14, 2009.First in the Stephanie Plum Between the Numbers/Holiday Novels and falling in at 8.5 in the Stephanie Plum romantic suspense series revolving around a bounty hunter in Trenton, New Jersey. If you're interested, there is a chronological listing of the Stephanie Plum books on my website.My TakeI remember the first time I read Visions of Sugar Plums. And it was disconcerting. Very little Joe. No Ranger. But a lot of Diesel. Enigmatic, mysterious, and very cheeky with a good heart.\n\"'Diesel is an alien or something,' I said to Morelli. 'He appeared in my kitchen this morning.'\n'As long as he didn't spend the night,' Morelli said. He reached around me to a cookie tin, removed the lid, and selected a cookie.\"\nDiesel is a new character (he now has his own series: Lizzy & Diesel) who will catch your interest if only for his forward sense of humor. He's definitely an alpha male, although more laid back than Ranger or Joe. He also has his own set of special powers. And he likes Stephanie's family!Visions of Sugar Plums is, obviously, set during the holiday season. A time of stress and lots of family togetherness. It makes for a good peek in at Stephanie's totally disorganized background, lol.\n\"How great is this?' Grandma said. 'If you marry Valerie we can celebrate some of those Jewish holidays. \u2026 Wait until I tell the girls at the beauty parlor that we might get a Jew in our family. Everyone's going to be jealous.'\n(This is followed by Stephanie's assessment of what her dad's thinking\u2026)\nNot that he had anything against Jewish guys. It was that chances were slim to nonexistent that Kloughn was Italian.\"\nWhich of course leads to Mom's reaction:\n'Maybe I need to put more cookies on the plate,' my mother said, pushing back from the table.\nOne more cookie run and my mother was going to be passed out on the kitchen floor.\"\nOne review I read of this story bemoaned the lack of forward progress for the characters, that it all stayed the same. It does. This is a series that is good for laughs and its lighthearted approach. I adore how Stephanie's lower middle class life is celebrated \u2014 she's real as is her family. And Evanovich makes it too, too funny as well even as she hands out nuggets for thought.\n\"'But she wants one. She'll hate me if I don't get her a pony. It'll ruin her Christmas.'\nBoy, I was really glad I had a hamster. I was planning on giving Rex a raisin for Christmas.\"\nThe StoryIt's a different FTA than Stephanie is used to hunting down. This one causes electrical storms and melts plastic Santas.The CharactersStephanie Plum is a bumbling, well-meaning bounty hunter. Rex is her pet hamster. Dad tries to ignore everything around him \u2014 especially Grandma Mazur! Ellen is the perfect Burg mom and housewife: meals on the table at 6pm, complete to dessert, always a brownbag (Mom-packed, of course) to go home with her helpless daughter, and a vigilant eye out for Steph's father lunging for Grandma.Valerie is her \"perfect\" sister who had to return home after her hubby absconded with the baby sitter and all their money (see \nSeven Up\n, 7). Mary Alice and Angie are her daughters, well, technically anyway. Mary Alice thinks she's a horse. Albert Kloughn is an ambulance-chasing lawyer for whom Valerie works (and dates).Diesel is a laidback hunk with \"powers\" including that of popping in and out and popping locks. We first met the midget, er, I mean, the little person, Randy Briggs, in \nHigh Five\n, 5, when he was an FTA.Lula is her plus-size sometimes-partner with a big mouth and a blustering approach to life. She will crack you up. Connie Rosolli is the big-busted, mustachioed office manager for Vincent Plum Bail Bonds and the very efficient descendant of a Mob family. Mrs. Bestler is very retired and likes to play elevator operator in Stephanie's apartment building. Lorraine, Mr. Feinstein, and Mo Kleinschmidt are more elderly neighbors.Detective Joe Morelli is Stephanie's on-again boyfriend with brief cameos \u2014 he's on a case. Carl Costanza and Big Dog are two cops Stephanie knows.Sandy Claws, a.k.a., Sandor Clausen, has retired \u2014 hey, he lost his powers, so he might as well quit the game. Now he's making toys. Elaine Gluck is his cookie-making sister. Lester is Sandy's production manager. John Ring is also retired and is Sandy's nemesis. Seems he hasn't lost all his powers.The Cover and TitleThe cover of my book is bright green with raised gold lettering outlined in red for the author's name and the title with a tiny, hog-ridin' Santa ornament in leather jacket and Santa hat dangling from the \"o\" in Evanovich.The title is what Stephanie has every Christmas, Visions of Sugar PlumsNow if only she could fulfill those visions\u2026"}], "description": "Stephanie Plum In Between the Numbers Christmas novelIt's five days before Christmas and things are not looking merry for Fugitive Apprehension Agent Stephanie Plum.
