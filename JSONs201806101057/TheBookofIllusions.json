But seeing a bit of silent film comedy on TV, he takes up the task of examining and writing a book about the work of one comedic genius from the 20\u2019s. Soon after the book is published the wife of the supposedly dead film-maker contacts Zimmer to ask if he might like to meet the man himself. There is much parallelism here, Zimmer with both Hector Mann, the ancient film-maker and Chateaubriand, the author of a lengthy autobiography that Zimmer is translating. In a way all three are dead. Zimmer and Mann had both attempted suicide. And a character in the book ultimately succeeds in such an attempt.What is real and what is illusion? Hector had been in the business of illusion, then had to present an illusion of himself for most of his life. His film The Life of Martin Frost echoes the book\u2019s theme of illusion. Sometimes an illusion can be a helpful thing, as when Zimmer is comforted by Alma on the plane (see below).There is a passage in which Mann spots what he believes to be a blue stone on the street. He has a detailed plan of what he will do with it, alive with human connection, only to find that it is a gob of spit. Yet the imagining was enough to alter his life course. Maybe illusions are what we tell ourselves, what we need, in order to survive. I enjoyed the book very much. It was a fast read, engaging, with interesting characters and enough suspense to sustain a level of tension. There was, perhaps, too little told of Hector\u2019s wife and why she does what she does. Well, Auster does explain, but I found it unconvincing. I wish that I had kept better track of characters. No, there are not hordes of them. I just wish that I had tracked the braiding of the stories. There is much interweaving here, much that occurs for some that also occur for others. I was too tired while reading this to devote adequate attention to that. C\u2019est la vie. I was encouraged, however, to read more of Auster."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "The Book of Illusions, Paul Auster The Book of Illusions is a novel by American writer Paul Auster, published in 2002.

As with the other Auster I've read (I know I've only read 2 Austers, I am such a failure at being pretentious), I finished this and I was like... what, why did I read this?To explain myself I should say that I follow the Roger Ebert school of criticism. Roger Ebert cares more about how a movie makes him feel than on its technical merits. Granted, this is rather less valid in the medium of words on a page than the sound and fury of film, but I still stick to it. I have no problem trashing Plath's Bell-jar, regardless of its supposed literary merit or historical significance, because it bored and annoyed me.But getting to the point of this book, let me break it down for you literary thugs: there is a man whose family dies in an accident. He is depressed, but then he sees a silent comedy on TV and laughs for the first time in long while. He then decides to write about the star of this silent comedy, a man named Hector Mann. In the course of this, he finds out that Hector Mann disappeared, but he may actually still be alive!!! Stuff ensues, there are some themes brought up, there's some angst, there's some sex, you know the drill. And don't worry none of that's spoiler material, all on the first page basically.Worth reading for a few pieces of stellar writing. I was particularly impressed by how Auster writes about a film that doesn't actually exist. I bought into it, I was convinced. It's a story within a story (within a story within a story ad nauseam), and it's true that the inner stories are better told than the outer ones. I'm cool with that.In summary, though: \"Paul Auster, you bastard!\" is my review. If you likewise enjoy calling famous authors bastards, then I recommend this book to you highly.As a side note, a result of this novel, I had to add a new shelf called \"bepretentious.\" Just read some of the other, actually useful reviews and you'll see what I mean."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/392338-jill", "userReview": "By reading this book I have become a die-hard Auster fan. The man is amazing. So clever, so imaginitive, so poetic and almost profound. This book rambles, and in doing so touches on so many intertwined narratives that one almost gives up on what was assumed to be the original plot and assumes the opening catch phrase was just another Paul Auster smoke screen story line. But this one, even in creating such an intricatedly woven network of a character experiences, never looses sight of its ultimate goal - to explain how the supposed disapearance of a silent film actor affected the life of a professor and widower from Detroit. The world created in this book is done with such care and is so full of unexpected and tangential details that I found myself wondering if I wasn't perhaps reading a work of historical fiction rather than just a plain old novel. It's an amazingly well crafted narrative, heartwrenching and hopeful at the same time.

Men whose realities take a turn towards the vague, so much so, that they seem to dress themselves in the vagueness that surrounds them. Men who lose everything or men who never really had anything to begin with. Men who seem to be caught for good inside an illusion along with everyone that surrounds them. Now they\u2019re here, now they\u2019re not. There are two of those men in The Book of Illusions: the narrator and Hector Man. Bound to each other, they meet only for an hour toward the end but the echo of their meeting is present after as much as before the event.What strange time for me to read this particular book! By the end of the first chapter it had grabbed me by the neck. What\u2019s weird is that my present state has something of the book\u2019s essence. As a result, book and reality mixed in an almost hurtful way. I regret, however, that my own illusions take up much of my mental capacity nowadays, which proved unable to fully embrace this haunting novel. Not that I regret the illusions themselves. Where would the point in that be, after all?It\u2019s haunting, intense, and filled with a melancholy that sticks on your fingers with every page that you turn. There\u2019s a kind of sadness in the very idea of illusions, and Auster sure took great advantage of that. It\u2019s the idea that everything you have can disappear in the blink eye. Something precious falls into our arms and we call it a miracle. One day, we open our eyes and it\u2019s gone. Then, it\u2019s a tragedy. The worst is that, once it\u2019s gone, one can never be sure if it was ever even there.Don\u2019t be fooled, The Book of Illusions is so much more than my clouded mind can produce right now.

This famous question is closely examined in \"The Book of Illusions,\" by author Paul Auster, as he tells the story of literature professor David Zimmer, who copes with the death of his wife and two sons by shutting out the real world so that he can inhabit the \"silent world of Hector Mann,\" an obscure actor from the 1920s. After leaving a dozen movies behind that nobody seems to know about, Hector disappeared in 1929, presumed dead. However, it turns out he is actually alive in New Mexico, paying penance for the role he played in the accidental death of his girlfriend \u2013 vowing never to make another movie and eventually only agreeing to make movies if they will be destroyed immediately upon his death and never be seen by an audience. According to Hector\u2019s rationale, if he makes a movie and nobody sees it, then his movie does not exist. But is this true? Does an idea have to be shared \u2013 and experienced by others \u2013 to exist and take on meaning? Although he provides confusing answers throughout the work, first suggesting that Hector\u2019s greatness can be achieved on his own, ultimately Auster seems to conclude that Hector\u2019s works only become important when they are shared and experienced by others.At first, Auster suggests Hector can attain greatness on his own, even without an audience. When Hector Mann disappears, his film career is pretty much over due to the invention of sound in movies and his heavy accent. His last major film, \"Mr. Nobody,\" is a response to the frustration he feels about his career, as, in the film, his character takes a magic potion that makes him invisible. Eventually, he is reborn as a new person, and, facing himself in the mirror, he confronts the fact of his own annihilation with an exuberant smile \u2013 the last image of Hector Mann that will be seen by audiences, seemingly content with the idea he is \"no longer the Hector Mann who has amused us and entertained us.\" Similarly, in his own life, Hector is forced to disappear after his girlfriend is killed, and, to disguise himself, he loses his trademark mustache, so that he is \"the spitting image of Mr. Nothing himself.\" In his new life, Hector no longer makes movies, but instead works odd jobs and focuses on reading, writing, learning English, and planting trees. In his journals, Hector writes, \"I talk only to the dead now. They are the only ones I trust, the only ones who understand me.\" Hector no longer shares himself with an audience \u2013 Hector Mann has been annihilated \u2013 but, according to his biographer and friend Alma, he is closer to greatness than ever before: \"[T]he further he traveled from his point of origin, she said, the closer he came to achieving greatness. [. . . ]Even now, he still talks about the trees as his greatest accomplishment. Better than his films, she says, better than anything else he\u2019s ever done.\" In this reading of Hector\u2019s life, based on the interpretation of \"Mr. Nobody,\" Hector is the only voice that matters; even without an audience, he can still attain greatness.However, a later film, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost,\" questions this notion that artists can attain greatness without sharing their work with others. In this movie, which Hector made after his disappearance with the promise it would never be released to an audience, is different from his earlier work: it is serious, not a comedy, and Hector does not act in it. In the movie, Martin Frost, a writer, must destroy his work to save the life of his girlfriend Claire. After she is brought back to life and realizes what has happened, she erupts in tears, asking Martin if he realizes what\u2019s he done and desperately wondering what they are going to do now. The movie ends ambiguously with her questions and no answers from Martin. Similarly, after Hector\u2019s death, his wife Frieda destroys everything \u2013 his movies, his journals, and even the manuscript of a biography his friend Alma had been working on for seven years \u2013 in a \"precise reenactment of the final scene of Martin Frost.\" Pondering Frieda\u2019s actions, David thinks about Hector\u2019s sacrifice of \"the one thing that would have given his work meaning \u2013 the pleasure of sharing it with others,\" but then realizes that, in Frieda\u2019s mind, \"It was about making something in order to destroy it. That was the work, and until all evidence of the work had been destroyed, the work would not exist. It would come into being only at the moment of its annihilation.\" In Frieda\u2019s interpretation, work was not created for others; in fact, sharing Hector\u2019s work with others would cause it to lose its meaning. However, ultimately, both of Auster\u2019s protagonists \u2013 David Zimmer and Hector Mann \u2013 seem to repudiate Frieda and believe that Hector\u2019s work does not lose meaning if it is shared with others. When Alma had first told David about her biography of Hector, he was initially skeptical: \"It\u2019s one thing to unburden himself to you, but a book is for the world, and as soon as he tells his story to the world, his life becomes meaningless.\" In other words, a book exists not for the author or subject but for readers, and by sharing himself with them, Hector could lose himself. He would exist as they saw him, and not as he really was \u2013 their illusions of him would become reality. When David questions Hector about why he would want to give himself away like that, Hector answers, \"Why should it bother me to turn myself into an example for others? [. . . .] You laughed, Zimmer. Perhaps others will begin to laugh with you.\" These words \u2013 the last Hector speaks in the book \u2013 show his realization of the positive impact his work can have on others, as he comes to the conclusion that his earlier films, if they made David laugh, were \"perhaps the greatest good\" he had done. David ultimately seems to embrace Hector\u2019s viewpoint, hoping that others will laugh with him, as he takes pleasure when Hector\u2019s silent comedies are put out on video and becomes an honorary member of a fan club, the International Brotherhood of Hector Manniacs. Most of all, he hopes that someday the lost films of Hector Mann \u2013 the ones that Frieda destroyed \u2013 will be found somehow so others can enjoy them like he did, \"and the story will start all over again. I live with that hope.\" In order to have meaning, Hector\u2019s films must be shared with others. Unlike Frieda, David believes that Hector\u2019s films should be shared with the world. Although he provides confusing answers throughout \"The Book of Illusions,\" first suggesting that Hector\u2019s greatness can be achieved on his own, ultimately Auster seems to conclude that Hector\u2019s works only become important when they are shared and experienced by others. Like the confusing answers to the question of the movie that nobody sees, \"The Book of Illusions\" is full of other confusing themes and contradictions. For example, one major theme of the book is the effect of chance and how small circumstances can have a significant impact on our lives. However, while there are some small circumstances which impact the action in the book, for the most part, the major events are more like contrived and implausible plot devices \u2013 an ex-girlfriend killed by a current girlfriend, a wife and two sons lost in a plane crash, David held at gunpoint so that he will watch a movie, a tough fall resulting in another death, a suicide, a possible murder. Are these really \"small circumstances\" of chance? Moreover, while this issue of fate is explored in depth like the meaning of one\u2019s work, the two themes are never tied together. In Auster\u2019s telling, both Hector and David cope with loss by turning to art but they are not reborn again except through accidents of fate, so that the one seemingly resolved idea in the book \u2013 the issue of the movie nobody hears \u2013 becomes irrelevant compared to the greater themes of fate and rebirth. The interplay between the various themes is never explored, and it is easy to get confused as all of these ideas are presented, but are often contradicted and never fully resolved, leading a reader to ponder the 2001 Atlantic Monthly article\u2019s criticism of Paul Auster: \"[He] knows the prime rule of pseudo-intellectual writing: the harder it is to be pinned down on any idea, the easier it is to conceal that one has no ideas at all.\" In light of the questions asked in \"The Book of Illusions,\" it is easy to wonder: if an author throws out a lot of different ideas but never resolves them, so that readers can\u2019t understand what those ideas are, do the ideas actually exist?"}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "David Zimmer is a teacher and writer whose wife and two young sons have been killed in an aeroplane crash. At his lowest ebb, suicidal and alcoholic, David sees a silent film on television and laughs for the first time since the tragedy. Thereafter, he develops a fascination with the actor featured in the old movie, Hector Mann - a minor star of silent comedies who vanished in 1929 and was never seen or heard of again. Travelling around the world in order to visit the film archives containing Hector's few movies, David channels his obsession into a book about the actor's work. However, the story really begins some time after this, when David receives a mysterious letter containing some startling news about Hector.The Book of Illusions displays many characteristics of Auster's typical style, most noticeably the constant presence of symbolism, the perceived significance of art and the line between reality and (as the title suggests) illusion. Here, rather than the emphasis being on language and writing, the focus is on Hector's films and their visual impact, though of course the power of storytelling is still key. When David discovers that Hector made some films that were never seen by anyone else, he questions whether art has any importance if it is not shared with and experienced by an audience. David's ruminations are mirrored in various ways throughout the narrative - David withdraws from life, shuts himself away and becomes invisible, so it seems ironic that he becomes obsessed with a silent movie star; Hector makes a film called 'Mr. Nobody' in which he literally becomes invisible, and then, in his real life, he disappears; another character, Alma, is made more visible by a large birthmark on her face, yet she feels this gives her the ability to instantly see others' true characters through their reactions to her appearance.There are elements of the story that are, from a distance, completely implausible. The manner of David and Alma's first meeting is really quite ridiculous, and certainly unbelievable, as is the speedy development of their relationship. But I think this is where the genius of Auster's writing really lies, in suspending the reader's disbelief and immersing you so deeply into the story that these strange events seem believable. I can imagine that the book won't work for everyone - some may find the lengthy descriptions of unseen, nonexistent films dull (I really enjoyed them), and there's a curious... quietness about it all - a very subdued feel. This is not a deeply thrilling novel, more of a restrained but haunting little tale. On balance I think I personally prefer Oracle Night, but there is plenty to recommend this story, especially for fans of the author. (If you're not already acquainted with Auster, I'd still recommend The New York Trilogy as a primer.)"}, {"userName": "George Georgiadis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33419047-george-georgiadis", "userReview": "\u039c\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03ac\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b6\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 True Detective: \"To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing.

This story grabbed me from the off, and was indeed difficult to put down. Ok so he is an acquired taste, but there is just something about his writing that hooks you in and doesn't let go so easily. The story here is both captivating and strangely mysterious. It's all about digging into the past in quite an obsessive manner, just who was Hector Mann?, what happened to him?, is he still alive?, gripped by intrigue, professor David Zimmer makes it his life's goal to discover the truth, and step by step he pulls back the blanket on an enigmatic life that no body else would even bother about. Could the great silent film star have been pulling the wool over everyone's eyes all this time?, as we enter deeper and deeper into a cocktail of deceit and dissimulation, his quest for answers starts growing like a cancer. Traversing through the American mid-west and finally New Mexico, nothing could prepare Zimmer for just what is about to follow...This could be viewed as the brother to 'The New York Trilogy', covering roughly the same sort of ground in places here, but whereas TNYT had cold complexities that either sucked you in, or drove you away, this although complex, has a warmer feel to it and by far is easier to read. Hardcore Auster fans may view this as not his best, but I was totally immersed from start to finish, even if it wasn't the ending I was crying out for. A dazzling masterpiece of fiction!"}, {"userName": "Alika Yarnell", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/376260-alika-yarnell", "userReview": "A surprising book that is riveting through to the final words. I say \"surprising\" because at first it's not clear as to what kind of book this is going to be. As with some of Auster's other work, the novel is told through a first-person narrator who happens to be a writer. We get long accounts of the book he is writing (about a silent filmmaker who went missing some years prior) and almost forget that there is a narrator involved, that we aren't reading a third-person account of this filmmaker's strange life. But the book takes several turns and we get our narrator back--with interest--as a series of events unfold in a haunting and devastating way. Auster is a master at seamlessly weaving complex themes into his prose without being heavy-handed or at the sacrifice of a good and entertaining story. Hats off to you, sir."}, {"userName": "Ingrid", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38698167-ingrid", "userReview": "Primo romanzo che leggo di un autore, Paul Auster, di cui ho letto sempre bene, special modo per il suo romanzo pi\u00f9 famoso, vale a dire \"Trilogia di N.Y\". Psicologicamente sopravvissuto alla morte della famiglia in un disastro aereo, David Zimmer attraversa un normale periodo di depressione e sconforto assoluto interrotto, quasi magicamente (o, per l'appunto, in modo illusorio), dalla visione di un film muto alla televisione. In questa pellicola, che lo fa ridere fino alle lacrime, c'\u00e8 un attore, il protagonista, Hector Mann, al quale decide di dedicarsi, vedendo e studiando i suoi film.Da l\u00ec si aprono un ventaglio di storie, di matrioske di emozioni e frammenti di vite vissute, in un incalzare sempre pi\u00f9 vorticoso. La trama principale e' apparentemente lineare e anche un po' scarna, ma il vero nucleo del racconto sono il lungo flashback sulla vita di Mann prima e dopo la sua scomparsa e due descrizioni dei suoi film. Questi ultimi in particolar modo sono cos\u00ec dettagliati e descritti alla perfezione, che ti lasciano la sensazione esatta di aver visto anche tu quel film.E' un romanzo che rapisce e incanta, una storia dolorosa raccontata da un amico, che ti si confida e si apre via via che il romanzo prosegue. Ogni pagina \u00e8 dolorosa, misteriosa e incantevole. La scrittura di Auster \u00e8 davvero incisiva, diretta, senza il bench\u00e9 minimo fronzolo, scandaglia le angosce e le nevrosi dell'uomo in modo fin troppo spietato, descrivendo la solitudine dell'uomo e i demoni che lo abitano con assoluta lucidit\u00e0."}, {"userName": "Schuyler", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/820032-schuyler", "userReview": "Oh Mr. Auster, what are we to do with you? This might have been the last book I end up reading by Paul Auster. It's been a nice ride, but I think he's run his course in my literary life. He's not doing anything great with language, though that's not really his \"thing\" anyway...he's more about playing with narrative and building pseudo-complex plots whose ideas aren't fully realized. There was a lot in this novel that I found almost laughably cliche, but the bath tub sex scene towards the end stands out in my mind. I think it's best for writers to stay away from sex scenes in 'literary fiction', and if you are going to attempt such a thing, better keep it nice and vague.

needs to stop. Now. In the beginning (starting with The New York Trilogy) his work was an interesting theoretical experiment. As of late he's become a caricature of himself. I'm tempted to accuse him of plagiarizing the Paul Auster of 20 years ago. The transcription of that court case would be like a general survey of his career and what he still insists on doing in his literature. The prosecution (Paul Auster) would convince the jury that the defense (Paul Austen, probably under a pseudonym) has committed some innate crime against human nature dealing with identity and structuralism. The judge (Paul Auster) would find everyone equally guilty and sentence them to a contrived, irrational suicide.Auster has taken an interesting device for writing a single novel, and made it into his theory of literature.An almost ridiculously funny book."}, {"userName": "Cat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9728092-cat", "userReview": "Como sempre, demorar um m\u00eas ou mais (como foi o caso) a ler um livro \u00e9 mau sinal.

Infelizmente n\u00e3o gostei da hist\u00f3ria por a\u00ed al\u00e9m, e n\u00e3o consegui relacionar-me com qualquer uma das personagens.Leva duas estrelas porque a escrita do autor d\u00e1-me esperan\u00e7a de que o pr\u00f3ximo seja melhor."}, {"userName": "Mikheil", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10518229-mikheil", "userReview": "\u10d5\u10d8\u10e2\u10e7\u10dd\u10d3\u10d8, \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10dd\u10e1\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e3\u10d9\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10e1\u10dd \u10e2\u10d4\u10e1\u10e2\u10d8\u10d0, \u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10db\u10d4 \u10ec\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10d9\u10d8\u10e2\u10ee\u10d0\u10d5\u10e1-\u10db\u10d4\u10d7\u10e5\u10d8, \u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10e0\u10d0\u10db \"\u10e8\u10e3\u10e8\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8\" \u10d3\u10d0 \"\u10dd\u10d2\u10d8 \u10e0\u10d4\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e8\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0\u10dd \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8\u10d5\u10d8\u10d7\" \u10db\u10d0\u10d8\u10dc\u10ea \u10d5\u10d4\u10e0 \u10e8\u10d4\u10db\u10d0\u10e7\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d0 \u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8.\u10d8\u10e1\u10d4 \u10d9\u10d8 \u10eb\u10d0\u10da\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc \u10d9\u10d0\u10e0\u10d2\u10d8 \u10ec\u10d8\u10d2\u10dc\u10d8\u10d0.\u10e3\u10d1\u10e0\u10d0\u10da\u10dd\u10d3 \u10d0\u10db \u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10e1 \u10e0\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0\u10ea \u10d3\u10d0\u10d5\u10d0\u10d9\u10d5\u10d8\u10e0\u10d3\u10d8, \u10d6\u10dd\u10d2\u10ef\u10d4\u10e0 \u10eb\u10d0\u10d0\u10dc \u10ec\u10d8\u10d9\u10d4\u10d1\u10e8\u10d8 \u10d2\u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10e1\u10d3\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d4\u10d1\u10e8\u10d8 \u10d9\u10d8\u10d3\u10d4\u10d5 \u10d0\u10ee\u10d0\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10db\u10d1\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10db\u10dd\u10d2\u10dd\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0, \u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10e7\u10dd\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d7\u10d5\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10d5\u10dc\u10dd \u10dc\u10d0\u10db\u10d3\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d0\u10e0 \u10d5\u10d4\u10e0 \u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10ee\u10dd\u10da\u10db\u10d4. \u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd -1 \u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10e1\u10d9\u10d5\u10da\u10d0\u10d5\u10d8. \u10d7\u10e3\u10db\u10ea\u10d0 \u10e4\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d1\u10dd\u10db\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10d5\u10e2\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db\u10d0\u10d0, \u10ec\u10e7\u10d0\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10e0 \u10d2\u10d0\u10e3\u10d5\u10d0 \u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10e1! <3"}, {"userName": "Nona", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22041268-nona", "userReview": "\u10e3\u10d9\u10dd\u10db\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d0\u10e0\u10dd\u10d3 , \u10e3\u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10e0\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u2764\"\u10d0\u10e0\u10e1\u10d4\u10d1\u10dd\u10d1\u10e1 \u10e4\u10d8\u10e5\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8,\u10e0\u10dd\u10db\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1\u10d0\u10ea \u10e8\u10d4\u10e3\u10eb\u10da\u10d8\u10d0\u10d7 \u10e8\u10d4\u10e8\u10d0\u10da\u10dd\u10dc \u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8,\u10db\u10d0\u10ee\u10d8\u10dc\u10ef\u10d8 \u10eb\u10d0\u10da\u10db\u10dd\u10e1\u10d8\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d0\u10d6\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8,\u10d2\u10d0\u10e4\u10d8\u10e5\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1\u10d7\u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10d5\u10d4 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10d2\u10ee\u10e0\u10ec\u10dc\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc.\u10db\u10d4\u10ea \u10db\u10d4\u10e8\u10d8\u10dc\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0 \u10d8\u10db\u10d8\u10e1,\u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10d5\u10d8\u10ea\u10dd\u10d3\u10d8,\u10db\u10d4\u10e8\u10d8\u10dc\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10d0\u10db \u10ea\u10dd\u10d3\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10db\u10dd \u10e1\u10d0\u10e8\u10d8\u10dc\u10d4\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d2\u10d0\u10dc\u10ea\u10d3\u10d0\u10e1 \u10d5\u10d4\u10e0 \u10db\u10dd\u10d5\u10d8\u10e8\u10dd\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d3\u10d8,\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10e2\u10dd\u10db \u10d8\u10db \u10e4\u10d8\u10e5\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d8\u10e2\u10e7\u10d5\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d3\u10d0\u10d7\u10e5\u10db\u10d0 \u10d0\u10e0 \u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10dd\u10d3\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e1 \u10db\u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10db\u10d3\u10d4 \u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d3\u10d4\u10d1\u10d3\u10d8,\u10e1\u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10db \u10e1\u10d8\u10e2\u10e7\u10d5\u10d4\u10d1\u10db\u10d0 \u10e9\u10d4\u10db\u10d6\u10d4 \u10eb\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e3\u10e4\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0 \u10d0\u10e0 \u10d3\u10d0\u10d9\u10d0\u10e0\u10d2\u10d4\u10e1.\""}, {"userName": "Carl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667282-carl", "userReview": "A few of my favorite things: smart men, secret lives, cinema, facial scars, multi-layered mystery, artistic masterpieces unveiled, itchy sexual tension...I can't love this book any more.

He goes on a destructive binge of drinking and taking pills until he happens to see a documentary in which he is drawn to silent film comedian Hector Mann, who vanished around 1929 after a brief but promising film career. Zimmer begins to investigate the work of Hector Mann, an interest which becomes an obsession which takes him on a quest to see the 12 films which were mailed, anonymously, to 12 museums around the world. He ends up writing a book about Mann and some time later receives a letter from a woman claiming to be Mann's wife, saying that Mann is very much alive, but ill, and would like to meet with him. This sets off a series of events no one could anticipate.Auster writes with such convincing detail that the first part of his book reads almost like a documentary, so much so that I wanted to google Hector Mann and find out what Wikipedia had to say about him. (I actually found there is an entry, about a band that created an album based on Auster's book, and several entries by people who seem to think Mann was a real actor.) Auster's description of Mann's films is so detailed it makes it difficult to believe they don't actually exist. If Auster wanted to make those films, he already has a ready-made screenplay within his own book.This is a great read and highly recommended.ADDENDUM: I have read through the negative reviews for this book and must add that this was my introduction to Auster, so I don't have the luxury of comparing this to his previous works."}, {"userName": "Cassie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500860-cassie", "userReview": "I LOVED this book! This is a story within a story within a story. It's no wonder why it's called \"The Book of Illusions.\" What I like most out of it is that you can choose what is real and what is fantasy. Even if all the stories told within these pages are real (fictional real, I mean), it is still takes you on an amazing metaphysical journey. It is about a supposed \"missing\" silent film star, Hector Mann, who is presumed dead after so many years after his disappearance. We learn about him through the research of another man, David Zimmer, whose own life is on a downward spiral. With the help of a few stories here and a tale there, David puts the pieces together and ultimately finds what he's looking for, in more ways than one. Unlike Paul Auster's other works, as in \"The New York Trilogy\" I was very satisfied with the ending for \"The Book of Illusions.\" It's satisfying in the fact not because it is a so-called \"happy ending\" but because it makes you question your own life, the connections you have to other people, and how things happen for a reason."}, {"userName": "Shila shokouhifar", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39500436-shila-shokouhifar", "userReview": "\u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0631 \u0646\u0642\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a \u0627\u062f\u0628\u0649 \u060c\u0628\u0627\u064a\u062f \u062d\u0631\u0641\u0649 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0632\u0646\u0645 \u0643\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0645 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u062f \u0622\u0646 \u0643\u0631\u062f\u0647\u061b \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0643 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0646\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0643\u0647 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0642\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0645\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0648\u0649 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0627\u067e\u0647 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u0632 \u0645\u064a\u0643\u0634\u064a\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u064a\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u064a\u062f ... \u0646\u0647 . \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0645 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0643\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0631 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627\u0649 \u0642\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0631\u0627 \u064a\u0643 \u0628\u0647 \u064a\u0643 \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0642\u062a \u0635\u0631\u0641 \u0643\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u062f \u060c\u0631\u0648\u0649 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0627\u067e\u0647 \u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0643\u062a \u0648 \u062a\u062e\u062a \u0648 \u067e\u0634\u062a \u0645\u064a\u0632 \u0646\u0634\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u062f \u060c\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0647\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0649 \u0643\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u062f.\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0645 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645\u0649 \u0633\u062a \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u060c\u067e\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u067e\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u064a\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u062f \u0648 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0642\u0633\u0645\u062a\u0649 \u0643\u0648\u0686\u0643 \u0627\u0632 \u0643\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u064a\u062f\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647... \u0627\u0635\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0627 \u0628\u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u064a\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0634\u0627\u064a \u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645\u0649 \u0646\u0634\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u062f\u061f! \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0645 \u0647\u0645\u064a\u0646\u0642\u062f\u0631 \u062c\u0630\u0627\u0628 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0649\u060c \u0628\u0647 \u0644\u062d\u0638\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u060c \u0628\u0647 \u0633\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u062f\u0639\u0648\u062a \u0645\u064a\u0643\u0646\u062f.\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0645 \u0644\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0633\u062a .... \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u064a\u0635\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0647 \u062c\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0645\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0646\u0645 \u0643\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u06af\u0648\u0634\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u0649 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0649 \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0632\u062f\u0647 ... \u0647\u0645\u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0643\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0630\u0647\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647.\u0638\u0631\u0627\u0641\u062a \u0639\u0645\u064a\u0642 \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u0647\u0627 ... \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a \u062c\u0630\u0627\u0628... \u062d\u0631\u0641\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0649 \u0643\u0647 \u062a\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0637\u062d \u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0645\u0642 \u0645\u064a\u0628\u0631\u062f :)"}, {"userName": "Hans Castorp", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8191987-hans-castorp", "userReview": "No es la primera vez que tengo esta sensaci\u00f3n con Auster: la obra empieza bien, crea sensaci\u00f3n de intriga, te mantiene a lo largo de trescientas p\u00e1ginas y justo en las \u00faltimas veinte o treinta, pum... todo se viene abajo.

After losing his wife and young sons in a plane crash, Vermont professor David Zimmer spends his waking hours mired in grief. Then, watching television one night, he stumbles upon a lost film by silent comedian Hector Mann, and remembers how to laugh . . .Mann was a comic genius, in trademark white suit and fluttering black moustache. But one morning in 1929 he walked out of his house and was never heard from again. Zimmer's obsession with Mann drives him to publish a study of his work; whereupon he receives a letter postmarked New Mexico, supposedly written by Mann's wife, and inviting him to visit the great Mann himself. Can Hector Mann be alive? Zimmer cannot decide - until a strange woman appears on his doorstep and makes the decision for him, changing his life forever.'A nearly flawless work . . .
