(finally she thinks of that)  Children with attention deficit disorder should be taught outside as \"they can't bounce off the walls there\". The difference for small boys is amazing. I have always thought it was torture to be cooped but in a hot reeking classroom and not allowed to go outside. Its like torture for small children and very bad for them. She really discusses this at length. In Germany they have \"forest classes\" outside. Also, classrooms are toxic with magic marker odors and other toxins which can cause brain damage. There is usually no fresh air as teachers won't open the window or there are NO windows to be opened. For a time I had to sit too near the chalkboard and I am allergic to chalk and it gave me asthma. It was impossible for me to say anything about this and I just had to endure it. I hope people will read this book and wake up about these problems.  I was surprised to learn that being out in nature also makes a big difference for those with PTSD. People need to be around trees and water.

Preaching to the already converted is an easy job - but I fervently wish that more institutions would pay attention to the deep physiological/psychological connection that human beings have with nature. Schools should incorporate more outside activities and studies. Buildings should be constructed with nature in mind. Give us trees, give us air, and give us a little more silence.......please.Still, despite the fact that I already know I feel better hanging around outside, Williams's book articulates why I feel the way I do - and she incorporates the current science behind it. Why do we think better while walking in nature? Why is our memory better? Why is our mood? This book gathers many answers in an attempt to reveal the significance of getting outside. The author writes: Humans have brains that are sensitive to social and emotional stress and we always have. Perhaps what matters is not the source of the stress but the ability to recover from it. This is a key point, because it's perhaps what we've lost by giving up our connection to the night skies, the bracing air and the companionate chorus of birds. When I'm walking across a pleasant landscape, I feel I have time and I feel I have space. I'm breathing deeply things that smell good and seeing things that bring delight. It's hard not to feel the pull of a grounded reality when you're dipping into a muddy trail or a flowing river. And yet, apparently 15% of the population hates anything to do with the natural world. They hate the dirt, they hate bugs, and their stress (cortisol) levels do not dip down. Interesting. But the other 85% of us probably feel trapped by car exhaust, traffic, leaf blowers, and four walls. Of course, if you're a park ranger or a ski instructor then you're already living the life of Riley - but most of us can't do that and survive economically. (Or perhaps we just think so). Still, some great points are made about \"containerized children\" and ADHD, points which lead to the overall message of the book: nature heals. I'm a believer."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7567867-mike", "userReview": "As much as I wanted to love this book, and was excited to finally get my hands on it, I found the material to be presented in such a dry and slogging format I was relieved to finally finish it.

I am reviewing an advance reading copy. The strength of this book is the skill that Williams has with setting a scene. Her descriptions are very visual and engaging. My favorite chapters were about nature therapy and the role of nature within society in both Japan and Korea. She also does a good job of citing her sources, which is something that writers in the \"popular science\" genre sometimes really fail at. Similar to other popular science authors, (Mary Roach, for example), Williams is herself a character in her journey to learn more about \"why nature makes us happier, healthier, and more creative.\" For the most part she comes across as earnest and self-aware, but if her voice gets under your skin early on, she can come across as a little annoying. I think that this is a problem that editing could definitely remedy, and it may not be a problem with the book when it is published. The primary downfall of this book (or at least the advance reading copy) is that it seems to lack a real focus or narrative arch. Williams does a lot of research into LOTS of ways that humans interact with nature as well as studies looking into how nature impacts the moods and health of people. A ton of food for thought, but there isn't a clear journey. My opinion is that this book would have been more powerful if it were slightly less episodic. I am passing this book along to my boyfriend (who bemoans our living in New York City and yearns for rural life) so I can say that I would recommend this book, especially to people who already hold some beliefs that green space is superior to urban/concrete space. It's also worth noting, however, that my coworker--a born and bred New Yorker--thought that The Nature Fix was a bunch of hooey.**Update**The boyfriend who hates city life *adored* Nature Fix and called it one of the best books he has read recently. He's a scientist, too, which I think speaks highly of Williams's ability to write clearly and use scholarly resources. For me, this book remains 3.5 although I haven't looked at a finished copy since my review."}, {"userName": "Emily Crow", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23080450-emily-crow", "userReview": "The subject matter is fascinating--the author travels around the world, talks to researchers, and participates in different projects that are attempting to demonstrate all the different ways that being around nature is good for us. Some of the projects were kind of goofy, like virtual reality treadmills or taking walks with EEGs on her head, others made me wish I could experience them as well, such as Japanese forest bathing or a therapeutic kayaking trip. I'm less enthusiastic about Williams' writing style, however. It's quite readable, and I think would be appealing to those who are only casually interested in the topic, which is good, but sometimes her random pop cultural references or strange comments about someone's appearance would be distracting. Her chapter about the Finns seemed especially glib and patronizing, at various points characterizing them as \"gnomic\" and being in a state of arrested development (due to their enduring love of being outside). Despite my reservations, this is one of the more interesting nature books I've read this year, and I would recommend it to just about anyone.

This idea of healing stress, by simply walking and being in nature, whether that be forest, by the ocean or in the desert made so much sense to me. I was very keen to read Florence Williams\u2019s look at the science behind the positive, or otherwise, effects of nature on us as we move away from being outside in this digital age.Williams\u2019s writing is so engaging, serious when she has to be, sometimes skeptical, jokey and often humorous. She meets a huge cast of researchers and scientists from an array of countries and succeeds in giving the details that individualize these people while giving fascinating information about countries such as South Korea \u2013which I realized I clearly knew nothing about beforehand.The book moves from an introduction where Williams talks about her own move from Boulder Colorado to Washington D.C because of her husband\u2019s job \u2013she is clearly still irked about this- and how this has changed her own experience of nature, to Japan which was one of the first countries to spend money on researching this field. She then moves to looking at the amount of time spent in nature; five minutes, five hours a month, days and weeks at a time, all with a correlating increase it seems in wellbeing. These effects range from an increase in NK (natural killer) immune cells (a good thing), lowered blood pressure, a decrease in pre-frontal cortex activity \u2013basically turning off our \u2018thinking\u2019 brain and switching to our \u2018relaxed, dreamy brain\u2019, relief from depression, an increase in memory and cognition skills and more. All the way through, there is fascinating historical snippets and quotes, clearly articulated science explanations, interesting people, enthusiasm and empathy. It is when she turns to the experience of wilderness for those who have PTSD, in this case female USA veterans who are suffering mentally and physically, that what has seemed relatively light-hearted gets serious. With a husband who is an Afghanistan combat vet, the stories these women told touched my heart and reading about their experience on a specialized outdoor program that took them out for a week into the Idaho wilderness was strong stuff. They weren\u2019t miraculously fixed but you can read about what it did or did not do for them yourself.There is so much great stuff in this book, how being outside is so important for kids, particularly those with ADHD, what we can do to experience nature when we live in cities \u2013as over half of us do- and the fact that for 15% of us, being in nature is not beneficial at all, even scary. The studies and names are numerous and I feel as though this is a book that needs rereading because of how much is in it. Yet it is entirely readable, I am a very slow reader but shot through this. The science of this subject is in its early stages and continually evolving but I can\u2019t wait to see where else it might go to show how clearly we need the natural world."}, {"userName": "Marigold", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31624155-marigold", "userReview": "Time spent in nature is restorative, creativeizing, anxiety busting, miraculous. This book explains how this has been explored by scientists looking to prove and explain nature's benefits. The Nature Fix felt disjointed to me, hopping around the world and briefly visiting scientists or forest rangers. It wasn't until I was near the end of this book that I realized the connections between its message and what I try to do at work. The accumulated evidence of measurable positive impact achieved through time spent outside is powerful. But again, the disjointed scattering of information made the idea of rereading to find pertinent facts a dreaded chore promptly discarded.

Your choice.The subtitle for this book is: Why Nature Makes Us Happier, Healthier, and More Creative. Author Florence Williams does give us some of the scientific evidence to answer the question of 'why' and she's clearly explored a few different studies into the effects of nature on the human psyche.But why do we need this book?I picked up this book even though I'm already a strong believer in the need for fresh air and the outdoor environment. I personally would rather be hiking through a woods or sitting on a beach shore than just about anywhere else. I don't need convincing in the effects of the outdoors. This book isn't for me.But I'm no fool. I know that there are many people (more than half the population as of 2008, according to this book) who live in metropolitan areas who don't get to experience nature. So is this book for them? Is this going to change the mind of the shut-in or the city dweller who doesn't experience a walk among trees or a long a shore? \"Oh...I didn't realize there was scientific evidence...\"?Most urbanites, in my mind, don't get out into nature because they either can't or they don't know where or how to go. The scientific evidence that they need to go isn't the motivation that they need. No ... this book is more for the self-confirming - to maybe justify why we head out for a picnic on a Saturday instead of cleaning out the furnace room or doing a little work at home to catch up.I can't imagine who I would give this book to. My outdoorsy family doesn't need it, and my city-dwelling family wouldn't care about it.Some of the material is presented in a straight-forward, rather dry style and the early chapters where a bit of a chore to read. The later chapters were more engaging and felt like a breath of fresh air. Still, while I agreed with the conclusions presented, I was left wondering why this book would be important or a must-read. I haven't come up with any answers.Looking for a good book? The Nature Fix by Florence Williams is a hard look at the documented importance of finding time to spend in nature, but the book is self-affirming to those who already spend time outside and unlikely to convince anyone else of the need.I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review."}], "description": "From forest trails in Korea, to islands in Finland, to eucalyptus groves in California, Florence Williams investigates the science behind nature\u2019s positive effects on the brain.
