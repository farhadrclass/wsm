I was browsing free books on iBooks on my iPad looking for an electronic cozy this afternoon when I stumbled upon a name that kept popping up... Killer Cupcakes. Well, given that I like Diane Mott Davidson and Joanne Fluke, I gave it a try. 58 minutes later, the book was finished. I'm still unsure of what just happened in the last hour.\nStory\nLexy took an opportunity to change her life, leave her cheating boyfriend and open her dream bakery showcasing cupcake tops (don't ask where the bottoms go!). She meets a hunky new detective who lives next door to the house she takes over from Nans, her grandmother, when she moves into a retirement home. They flirt. Suddenly Lexy's ex-boyfriend Kevin is found poisoned after eating her cupcakes! The detective has to whisk (oops, I mean frisk!) her to see if she's gone rogue. Along with Sprinkles (her dog) and a few friends (Cassie -- her assistant and best friend), and the grandmother's roommates, they quickly solve the murder on their own. Then Lexy can date the detective. \nStrengths\n1. Cute premise2. Quick read\nWeaknesses\n1. Was so very simple, basic and eventless2. Writing comes across like it's for new or young adult readers\nFinal Thoughts\nI read up on Ms. Dobbs... she was a former software engineer who quit her job to write. And now she has about 15 books published. So... I must either be missing something or she gets a lot better after her first book. While the mystery wasn't very exciting or ground-breaking, it meets all the traditional cozy requirements... thus I'm left suspecting the books and the author found their groove as the series continues. It was just too quick... Of the 169 pages, 30 were recipes and a preview of the next book. In the remaining 139, the pages were only filled up 50% of the time. Essentially, the page count is barely 100... and so the first 30 pages introduce the background, the middle 40 pages theorize on suspects and the final 30 pages detail the confrontation, capture and summary. Let's call it a short story intro to a new series and I can get behind reading another one! But that will be when I need a break from something intense and I have an hour of free-time."}, {"userName": "Berit\u2600\ufe0f\u2728Traveling Sister\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38946743-berit-traveling-sister", "userReview": "4 cozy stars!

Within 10 words of the introduction of the killer, it was supremely obvious that the person in question indeed killed the victim. Even the so-called \"twist\" with the love interest that kept the main character away was patently obvious.On top of the flaws in the plot, the proofreading was horrendous. Misplaced commas and apostrophes (no, not apostrophe's!

Poorly written and thought out, typos all over the place, zero knowledge of police procedure. The characters were all one-note, if that. Sprinkles the dog, with her cat-like tendencies, was the most interesting of the bunch.The author also does not seem to have done her research. Lexy brings the coded notebook to an amateur cartographer. It might just be me, but I'd think a cryptographer would be more useful than a mapmaker. Also, a truffle bowl is not a thing. A trifle bowl however is.And trust me, you would not wear designer stilettos to bake unless you are independently wealthy.

It wasn't at all what I expected. I don't know why, but I had in mind that it would be along the lines of Sophie Kinsella novels - a little silly, but fun. This book was actually ALL silly and NO fun. Everything about the book was ludicrous - the characters, the plot, the writing, the pacing, the motive... And the fact that the killer was a \"psychopath\" or whatever was SUCH a cop out. There was no character development, and the protagonist was the silliest person imaginable. For example she complains about being broke, but then goes shopping for expensive shoes... after she's already bitched about another girl having expensive shoes on a secretary salary.And the piece of evidence that eventually led to her (not the police of course) catching the killer? A button? Serious? How did he manage to lose a button rummaging around her house? And why would he wear a coat with a button missing to a broadcasted official event?

This brought back a lot of memories..I'm 5\"1, and worked in a couple of butcher shops and bakeries during my student years.

I almost want to give it a higher rating because I couldn't stop laughing the whole way through. I can't believe a grown adult wrote this. The whole thing comes across as a story invented by a little girl playing with dolls at her grandmother's house. The protagonist is living a Barbie-doll life - she does adult things, but in the way a child might understand them, like a child pretending to be an adult. Even the way she dresses (jeans, a pink t-shirt and pink platform stilettos) and what she eats is childish; throughout the book she's always eating cakes and biscuits and pastries and the one exception is when she goes out for burgers - and gets sauce all over her face.On top of that, the writing is incredibly unsophisticated - everything is explained, characters say what they're feeling, nothing is just implied or demonstrated through dialogue and action, and this extends even to the actual mystery. The author doesn't seem to trust her audience to be able to figure out or understand anything not directly spelled out for them. It's like the book was written for its own characters, because they actually are that dim - not to mention one-dimensional and, again, childish.Though I'm certainly not recommending this book, if you want to see how bad it is you can get it free from Amazon, so at least it won't cost you anything."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3813571-anne", "userReview": "I got this book for free on Amazon, but my review is based on how I felt after reading it and was not influenced by price.Fairly typical contemporary cozy.

Nana's got a group of sleuthy friends at the old folks home who are supposed to help Lexy (but are also wasted in this story). Lexy is cute, no...gorgeous, and wears stilettos and other uber expensive shoes all day at the bakery (I hate fashion stupid, excuse me, fashion conscious heroines, who are inappropriately dressed for their jobs/sleuthing).I don't believe there was a single possessive apostrophe in the entire book, but other than 1 or 2 typos that's all I noticed and it didn't really bother me.The story line was predictable and simple with Lexy finding a button being the clue to the killer more than any actual detection work.

Lexy Baker is living with her dog Sprinkles in her grandmothers how now that she's moved into a assisted living place. Everything is great for Lexy she has her dream business a bakery, she can eat anything she wants without gaining a ounce and she loves shoes. What more could a girl ask for?When Sprinkles ducks though the fence between the neighbor Lexy has no choice but to chase after her even if it's in her pj's only to find her using the neighbors flowerbed as bathroom. Thankfully Lexy is prepared but she's not prepared for the neighbor to catch her in the act of picking up poo, worse she finds him attractive. The next day Lexy is shocked to learn that her ex-boyfriend whom she's not seen in over two years is dead, because of eating her cake tops. Lexy is at the top of the suspects list with the help of her neighbor who happens to be a cop, her grandma's friends at the home just maybe she can find the real killer. Killer Cupcakes is a fun entertaining mystery, though short it doesn't lack in story-line I almost stayed up super late reading but opted for a few pages before I decided to finish it off first thing this morning. Killer Cupcakes is a fast paced story the keeps you drawn in till the last page so it's easy to lose yourself however it's only 89 pages which for some like me is a good thing. I love the characters Lexy is great plus she has her grandmother who is in her own little ladies mystery group and who doesn't love a cute cop. I kind of want a little yappy dog named Sprinkles now at least that's what I told my hubby this morning he just ignored me since our next dog is going to be a big malamute maybe she will be Sprinkles.

With the bakery closed for testing by the police, she sets off to investigate. The book also includes recipes for cupcake tops and frosting.On the positives, I liked that Lexy is mainly surrounded by women. Her best friend is also a woman and she gets help from a group of elderly women. That does tend to be a strength of cozies, but it's not something to take for granted. There wasn't a love triangle (it's obvious who the love interest is and that they'll end up together), which is a good thing for me as I find love triangles endlessly angsty.On the negatives, the mystery was barely there. The character motivations were stretching it even for a cozy (like the police took all the ingredients from the bakery to test, rather than samples, which makes no sense even with handwaving police procedure). There isn't really anything new here in terms of the plot, characters and setting.I also dislike books where the main character can eat anything and not put on weight, and it's portrayed as a wonderful thing. I tend to lose weight quickly and put it on slowly. It's not wonderful. It means sugar crashes where I stop functioning if I forget a meal. It means even mild sickness can mean dropping underweight. This isn't a trope I can find fun.Overall, the writing flows well enough and it succeeds at its aim - it's a light-hearted book that can be read quickly, without a whole lot of attention required.

The protagonist is a bit too stereotypically feminine for my tastes - running a bakery is fine, but doing it in high heels seems a bit impractical. She's also just generally a bit flat, though that's understandable given the length of the story. I do like that there are a number of female characters in this. I loved the gang of old ladies who solve crimes with their iPads, and honestly I'd much rather read something entirely about them, rather than have them acting as supporting characters in this. The obvious love interest was also rather bland, and I found the way he kept flirting with the protagonist frustrating, given that she's a person of interest in the mystery. The mystery itself was a bit light, but it made sense and didn't feel like the author suddenly made up a solution, which is important. I do like the idea of shorter cozy mysteries for people who want to read short chunks in between the busy parts of their lives. Conceptually, it's a little like the literary equivalent of smartphone games. I do think this book would work well in this capacity - the chapters are short, and I could imagine that this would be a fun way to stay distracted while waiting for the bus or some such. Read like a normal novel, it's still fun, but the relative thinness becomes more apparent. For the low low price of free, though, I can't argue with it too much. It's not the best cozy I've read, but I enjoyed reading it and I might read some of the sequels, if I can bring myself to look past the fact that most of them are three bucks for a book this length or less."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9989803-patricia", "userReview": "I found this book as a freebie on amazon.
