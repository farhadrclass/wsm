{"ratings": 6003, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Meredith Holley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1302775-meredith-holley", "userReview": "This is the story of a serial killer who enslaves people, usually black men, and tortures them by telling them the date the killer plans to execute them and then by keeping them locked in chains until that date, always reminding them of the date\u2019s imminence. Sometimes, the killer tells them that if they are lucky, if the killer likes them enough, they might escape death, but that just seems to increase the torture because the killer doesn\u2019t really plan to let them go. The killer in this book also has a kind of Dexter complex, where the killer chooses victims morally corrupt enough that few people even notice their deaths. Of course, the killer in this book is state government.This is actually one of the saddest books I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s hard to feel very sympathetic towards the prisoners that Sister Helen advocates for, and I have to be honest that I don\u2019t share her confidence that a true life sentence will always be a true life sentence, or even that a true life sentence is more humane than the death penalty. On the other hand, I am completely convinced of the arbitrariness of state executions. Also, it was deeply tragic to read about the families of the executed men, and their devastation seems to deserve respect, just as does the devastation of the families of the executed men\u2019s victims. This year, I sat in the courtroom and watched parts of the trial of Angela McAnulty, who tortured her daughter to death over the course of about seven years. At the point that her daughter, Jeanette Maples, died, the coroner couldn\u2019t name a cause of death because there were so many possible causes. She had numerous infected wounds, brain hemorrhaging, water in her lungs, and was severely emaciated. Angela had forced (forced? convinced?) her husband to install locks, to which only Angela had the keys, on most of the doors in the house, including the bathroom. Her daughter was only allowed to use the bathroom supervised because she would try to drink out of the toilet if she was unsupervised. There were other things, worse things. There were other kids who weren\u2019t tortured, but who Angela involved in torturing Jeanette. The jury gave her the death penalty, and I have to say I would have done the same. In her police interrogation tape, she said that instead of torturing her daughter, she probably should have taken up smoking.So, I feel pretty conflicted about the issue of the death penalty. I think Sister Helen Prejean is a lovely woman, and I think her compassion is truly noble. I\u2019m not wholly convinced that the death penalty is the worst of American institutions, though. Buuuuuut, at the same time, the corruption that the death penalty seems to practically breed is truly disturbing. The fact that it is only used against the poor is equally troubling. Although Angela McAnulty confessed to her crimes, and so no trial occurred as to her guilt (the only issue was sentencing), it was still a problem to me that her defense attorneys put on almost no case. Their closing argument was something like, \u201cYep, this is pretty much the worst thing ever. You\u2019re a smart jury, and we\u2019re reconciled to whatever you decide.\u201d I\u2019m not satisfied that that is actually a defense. I know the burden is on the state to prove a crime, but that doesn\u2019t mean that no defense is necessary. According to Sister Helen, failure of the defense to actually provide a defense is a rampant problem.I keep coming back to thinking about this issue in relation to the recent Supreme Court case \nConnick v. Thompson\n. That case is fascinating. Like, I want to investigate it and write a book about all of the people involved in it. It is, like, EVERYTHING interesting about the law. But, the thing about it is that I feel with great certainty that Justice Thomas\u2019 opinion is correct (Slate does not agree). I think Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent would have created really troubling law. So the reason it relates to Dead Man Walking is that they are both about the death penalty in Louisiana and how corrupt the prosecution of criminals who end up on death row is. They are both about how legal procedure is basically what decides who wins and loses. Since I totally love legal procedure for some insane reason, I kind of love that fact, but not when people unjustly die because of it.One awesome thing about the Thompson case is that Harry Connick, Jr.\u2019s dad, Harry Connick, Sr., who was the lead D.A. in New Orleans for a helluva long time (Wikipedia says 1973-2003), is the \u201cConnick\u201d in the title of the case. Anyway, the issue in Connick v. Thompson was that Mr. Thompson was convicted of a crime and sentenced to the death penalty because the New Orleans prosecutors withheld evidence of a lab test that exonerated him. So, the lab tests get discovered, new trial, Mr. Thompson gets not only gets no death penalty in the new trial, he also gets completely acquitted of the crime. The withholding of evidence is a violation of the case Brady v. Maryland, which says prosecutors can\u2019t withhold exonerating evidence. Then, this is the interesting part (to me). You probably all know this, but I didn\u2019t before law school. The statute 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is the civil rights statute that says that we can sue people who \u201cunder color of\u201d state law deprive us of our rights. So, the Supreme Court says that \u201cpeople\u201d can mean a lot of things. One of the things it can mean is municipal authorities in their personal capacities. (Like, as themselves, not as their office. So, when Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska, I would sue her as Sarah Palin, not as governor.) It can also mean municipalities themselves, but if you sue a municipality, you have to show that there is some procedure or custom, instituted by the municipality, that supported the deprivation of your rights. Some rule to change. This is the same with suing someone in their official capacity, like suing Mr. Connick as D.A. of New Orleans, or suing Governor Sarah Palin.In Thompson, Mr. Connick, Sr., came out and said basically, \u201cYes, yes, unfortunately I misread Brady when I was the lead prosecutor.\u201d *this is me going ballistic* So, he misread Brady to mean that he was supposed to withhold evidence? No. I am not willing to believe that happened. But, the genius thing about this is that then the attorneys bringing Thompson\u2019s case sued the municipality, or Mr. Connick in his official capacity, not the prosecutors in their personal capacities. They argued that Mr. Thompson\u2019s case alone, one instance of withholding evidence, combined with Mr. Connick\u2019s statement that it was a mistake on his part, showed a custom of the municipality. And Justice Thomas was like, \u201cNo, one instance doesn\u2019t show a custom or a procedure or a rule that we can attribute to the municipality.\u201dPeople tend not to sue officials in their personal capacity because individuals have less money, less insurance, than municipalities. The interesting thing if you take the Thompson case with Dead Man Walking is that Prejean is pretty clear that she thinks that this kind of thing went on all the time in the New Orleans Parish. Even the Slate article above notes that Louisiana courts have overturned, for Brady violations, many convictions coming out of Connick\u2019s office. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong (and I honestly haven\u2019t read the opinion very closely because I have to actually do my schoolwork at some point), but it\u2019s my understanding that the Supreme Court only considered the violations in relation to Thompson (and it would seem that way, too, because Thompson is the only plaintiff here). So interesting that, at least as it appears from reading the facts in the opinion, the attorneys didn\u2019t bring suit using the other cases as well, even as evidence. All of the courts, even the lower courts that awarded judgment to Mr. Thompson, agreed that it was not custom or procedure to withhold evidence. Anyway, that\u2019s me geeking out on federal courts. I\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t explained the whole situation that well. And it does make sense to gamble by suing Connick in his official capacity, hoping for a judgment on which Mr. Thompson could actually collect, than to sue in his personal capacity. I just wonder about the lack of evidence. I wonder about the statements that Sister Helen makes in this book, which pretty blatantly imply that Mr. Connick\u2019s office has been consistently guilty of \u00a7 1983 violations. Okay, none of this is actually related to the paper I have to write on judicial review and the death penalty, so I need to go work on that now. It\u2019s all just been rattling around in my head, so I felt like I needed to put it to paper. If you\u2019ve made it this far, congratulations! Do you want to write my federal courts paper for me, too?"}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun", "userReview": "...if we believe that murder is wrong and not admissible in our society, then it has to be wrong for everyone, not just individuals but governments as well.\n\nThis is the crux of Sister Helen Prejean's argument against capital punishment. She also asserts that the death penalty is not a deterrent to violent crime, costs taxpayers substantially more than life in prison in the long run,and is not fairly meted out on the merits of a case, but instead influenced heavily by race, poverty, and geography. She also claims that the individuals involved with the actual execution are generally uncomfortable with the process and if the public were forced to face the reality of the killing, existing support would wane.I won't bother summarizing the plot/story. All I will say is that she offers a compelling argument against the death penalty, providing both personal accounts and statistics to back up her stance. At times I was brought to tears, which I think speaks to her ability to humanize the bad guys.Early in the book, I was bothered by the fact that she didn't spend as much time humanizing the victims. It's much easier to feel for the man sitting on death row when you are allowed to forget what he's done. However, I think she rectifies this somewhat in the second half of the book where the victims are finally given a face, albeit a somewhat hazy one.At this point in my life, I tend to agree with the sister, though I can't imagine how my resolve might be tested if it had been my child that was tortured, raped, or brutally murdered. Still, I think Prejean's recounting and thoughtful commentary raises a number of valid points not only about the death penalty but also the US criminal justice system in general. There are some religious undertones that I found annoying. Obviously, she felt her faith was a driving force behind her quest to have the death penalty abolished. Yet she works really hard to get there, a little too hard (after all Christianity is based on a human sacrifice...Christ's life in exchange for our souls...we are redeemed by Christ's blood and suffering...etc, etc, etc). Plus, my personal experience is that those who claim to be of a religious persuasion tend to be more supportive of the death penalty than those who are not.Bottom line: it's a great discussion about the value of life, and whether the collective \"we\" has the right to take it. Does government condoned violence really deter violence or help us to heal from violence or does it only perpetuate the same attitude of violence that we're supposedly trying to discourage/punish?"}, {"userName": "Graham", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8736735-graham", "userReview": "Wow. \"Work of the eyes is done, now go do the heart work\" (p309, from Rainer Maria Rilke)Sister Helen Prejean must be one of the bravest people in the world. Not only does she support men convicted of murder on death row, and be with them in hyper final hours, and be with them in the death chamber itself, but she makes time for the victims, attends and raises money for victim support groups and does all this in the name of Jesus, bringing hope and comfort, steel and velvet, challenge and compassion.I'm in awe. I thought the book was going to be challenging, but not like this: people, dates, times, corruption of legal process, withholding evidence, common brutality to the families of both those convicted and those victimised. And well researched, humane and thoughtful too. She does not shirk from hard questions, nor does she go for pro hominem arguments. She tells of one family who, after the man who murdered their daughter is executed, lose their focus: p188 'with Robert Willie dead, he doesn't have an object for his rage'. Isn't that the saddest sentence in the whole book?Compare with p312-3: \" Lloyd...went to the execution....not for revenge, but hoping for an apology. Patrick....had not disappointed him...'....I want to ask for you forgiveness...' and Lloyd had nodded his head, signalling a forgiveness he had already given.... But he acknowledges that it's a struggle...as he remembers David's birthday year by year and loses him all over again... Forgiveness is never going to be easy. Each day it must be prayed for and struggled for and won.\"Questions of justice, revenge, 'paying for crime', punishment, acknowledgement, restitution, acceptance, restoration all come up here. Whilst society perhaps still needs to come up with a way of adequately dealing with people who commit terrible crimes it is clear that the death penalty is not that way."}, {"userName": "Alberto Delgado", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54702590-alberto-delgado", "userReview": "El otro d\u00eda me encontr\u00e9 de nuevo con este libro mientras buscaba en la biblioteca futuras lecturas, lo le\u00ed hace ya casi 20 a\u00f1os pero es tan estremecedor que te marca y a pesar del tiempo recuerdo lo que me hizo sentir el leerlo.

I've never abandoned this many books in a short span of two months so I'm a little worried that I may be giving up too soon on them. Really wanted to like this and was so excited to read this since I had loved the movie with Sean Penn. The book is so dry though and reads like the reports they had us do back in high school, so in that sense it also made the book seemed outdated for me. The author jumps around a lot so there's not a linear storyline that made me focus on the story. I kept feeling like she missed chunks of story before she would jump onto another part of the story. For example, Sister Helen's recounting of her first encounter with Pat was so brief I felt like she didn't want to tell me everything that had happened. It made me start to lose interest every time she jumped around storylines. Highly disappointed that I did not like this more. A little part of me does not want to give up on this as I find a story about a nun befriending a man on death row so fascinating.

One thing that made me rethink the death penalty; she asserts that putting a prisoner to death is actually more expensive than keeping them incarcerated for life. I thought that was really interesting, because one of my main beliefs was that it was probably cheaper to put a prisoner to death than to keep him for the rest of his life. Sister Prejean says; \"Public surveys indicate that support for the death penally drops significantly when the public is assured that murderers will remain behind bars for life.\"Another couple of things that made me think; \"I wonder whether his death sentence makes his own repentance even more difficult.

This is a woman making an argument; her goal is to persuade. As a reader, I was always able to feel her persuading me as I read, and even though I agree with her--the death penalty as practiced in the American criminal justice system is an abomination and a farce--I had to keep reminding myself not to dig in my heels just because I don't like being persuaded of things.Which is also not to say that she is not extremely persuasive. Sister Helen is an excellent storyteller, and she is always careful to keep the other side of her story in mind: the Bourques and the LeBlancs as well as Pat Sonnier, the Harveys as well as Robert Lee Willie. She's perfectly open about her own rhetorical purpose, and she's willing to show the people who don't agree with her as being good and morally upright people who are able to turn their daughter's horrible death into purpose that is not simply about supporting the death penalty, but about advocating for the rights of the families of murder victims. She's sometimes a little disingenuous, but I never felt she was dishonest.The movie conflates Pat Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie, which I think does a disservice to the moral complexity of the book. Sonnier, who expresses remorse and accepts responsibility for his terrible crime, who loves his brother fiercely enough to forgive him and (in a sense) to die for him, who is open to and accepting of Sister Helen's message. Who is enough of a man (unlike Willie, the narrative suggests) to drop his machismo and admit his emotions. Sonnier, who thanks Sister Helen for loving him, is just about the perfect poster child for her purpose.Willie is not. He is not remorseful; he shifts responsibility to the other guy. (Willie & Sonnier are interesting mirrors of each other; both had a partner in crime, and both received the death penalty while their partner got life. Sonnier, in something that was either a clusterfuck or a very shrewd manipulation on Eddie Sonnier's part, confessed; Willie says consistently that it was all Vaccaro's fault, that Vaccaro did it. The closest he gets to admitting culpability is saying that he shouldn't have followed Vaccaro's lead.) He clearly likes Sister Helen, but he's resistant to being molded and he maintains his exaggerated machismo to the end. No confessions, no mention of love (except of course for his mother), no sign that there's anything in him that could be salvaged or rehabilitated or that is even capable of recognizing the idea.There's a really weird moment where Sister Helen tells him, while they're waiting for his execution, that when she first met him she thought he was a sociopath. And I said (I think even out loud), \"You mean you think he's not?\" She fails in her project there with me, in the sense that her project is to persuade readers that even the most hardened criminals are still, as her abolitionist lawyer friend says of Willie, \"a child sitting inside [a] tough, macho dude\" (119). I don't believe that about Willie--Willie makes my skin crawl, first to last--and in any case, that's not why I believe the death penalty is wrong.I believe the death penalty is wrong for many of the same reasons Sister Helen does. E.g.: (1) Our government, corrupt, inefficient, and even incompetent as it so often is, should not have the power of life or death over its citizens.(2) The imposition of the death penalty in America is grossly skewed toward African-Americans, the lower classes, (reprehensibly) the mentally disabled, and towards criminals who murder whites. If we're going to claim it's justice, then it has to be administered justly.(3) It is absolutely cruel and unusual punishment, despite the fancy footwork the Supreme Court tried to hide behind in Gregg vs. Georgia. Towards the end of the book, the father of one of Willie's victims says, \"Know what they should've done with Willie? [...] They should've strapped him in that chair, counted to ten, then at the count of nine taken him out of the chair and let him sit in his cell for a day or two and then strapped him in the chair again. It was too easy for him. He went too quick\" (235). What Vernon Harvey doesn't recognize, and what the narrative doesn't point out, is that that's what the torturous system of appeals and retrials and more appeals already does. Stays of execution, temporary reprieves, courts considering appeals only to reject them, the awful, awful cruelty of the power the governor has to commute the prisoner's sentence up until the literal moment the switch is thrown . . . these are torture just as much as the strappado or the rack. It shows more clearly, actually, with Sonnier, because we see more of the process and because Sister Helen (Helen-Prejean-the-author painting Sister-Helen-the-character as the raw naive newbie) doesn't truly believe Sonnier's going to die, that nothing she can do can save him, until 8:40 on the night of his execution (Sonnier officially died at fifteen minutes past midnight). This tug o'war with hope as the prize is dreadful, excruciating for the victim's family and excruciating for the man waiting to die. It's not justice.There are any number of ethical questions that neither this book nor this review have touched, infinite delicate delineations of gray between Sister Helen and Vernon Harvey (shades of black between Pat Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie), and I do in fact applaud this book for not shutting any of those down."}, {"userName": "Evelyne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3135804-evelyne", "userReview": "A still sadly relevant treatise on the injustice and cruelty of the death penalty in the United States. The author, Sister Helen, is the real star of the book.

I personally think that's a sad reflection on where we are with reading, presumably the thinking being that we need to see the movie visuals in order to realize we should pick up the book. Never mind, that is just a pet peeve.I don't know why I haven't read this before as I am passionately interested in the moral, legal, social and societal impact of the death penalty, on which my views have changed over the years.It's clear to me that, for a civilized society, capital punishment is anachronistic, barbaric, expensive and serves little purpose in crime deterrence. The supreme court ruled it unconstitutional due to it's capricious and arbitrary nature, and it is clear that very little, if anything has changed. The overwhelming majority of death row inmates are poor and likelihood of receiving this sentence is so dependent on the race of the victim, the lawyer that is hired and many other factors that to think anything else is na\u00efve.Now, the zeitgeist in which we currently reside seems to be summed up by extreme positions and the feeling that \"if your not with me, you are against me\" and then general discourse reduces itself to name calling, personal attacks and a statement of extreme positions. In the capital punishment debate, this manifests as accusations of anti-death penalty positions as soft on crime, soft on murders, insulting to the victims and so on.In reality, death sentences serve no purpose other than a misguided sense of revenge, out of context and misleading quoting of \"an eye for an eye\" etc. HP's take on this is more enlightened than the vast, vast majority of us who have never seen the death penalty in action (which is deliberate) and therefore can hide behind the sanitization of the taking of life. She clearly received a lot of the vitriol referred to above.However she states in this book, often indeed, that she condemns the crimes of those to whom she is the spiritual advisor and also feels deep compassion for the victims and especially, those left behind when a loved one is killed. This becomes more and more a theme as the book unfolds. The second time she worked with a condemned man she reached out equally to the parents of the victim who, understandably, wanted to see their daughter's killer put to death and did so.However this never seemed to bring them to the closure that they apparently sought. The father in particular still carried his anger although it now had no focus. He continued to talk about the killer, wishing he had suffered more, perhaps in the same way he killed others. This is natural but to carry that around for ever isn't good for anyone. This is so understated in the book but has huge power and impact - you can't help feeling for him, knowing that his anguish hasn't been salved by watching an electrocution.Which begs the question why do they continue? There is an alternative - life without parole which guarantees no more killing and seems an appropriate sentence. If not, why are all 1st degree murderers not executed? It shouldn't depend on how much money you have or the skill or your lawyer, surely?This book was, to me, very persuasive, but I have no doubt that there will be the usual, vitriolic assaults on those who hold similar views for a long time to come but everyone should read this, wherever you stand on this debate. Capital punishment is slowly (too slowly) waning in this country, please that it is soon consigned to history."}, {"userName": "Shana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/716578-shana", "userReview": "I read this book a few years ago. I'd seen the film in college as an undergrad, and while I was in divinity school, Sister Helen Prejean came as a speaker. I was so moved listening to her, and at the end of her talk, she mentioned they'd be selling her books and that all the profits would go to this anti-death penalty coalition. Well, I am and have always been against the death penalty, and the opportunity to support a cause I believed in as well as to get what I imagined to be a good book was too great. Despite the fact that the cost of two books was basically my entire cash flow for the rest of the week, I bought one for myself and one for my mom. I was not disappointed.Is the best book ever written? Absolutely not, and I noticed more of its flaws on this my second reading. However, she does a great job of both giving a personal and detailed argument against capital punishment based on her own experiences as a spiritual adviser to two death row inmates and of giving a big picture, statistically based argument. By sharing her own experiences, she gives death row criminals a face, makes them real people instead of monsters or cartoon villains. This isn't to say that the men haven't committed villainous acts. Both of the inmates whose stories she tells did horrible, monstrous things, but she makes clear that neither of them are monsters. They are men who made bad decisions, a lot of bad decisions, something we all do, albeit not to the extent they did. She also makes clear that both men are deserving of punishment. Neither one is or is portrayed as a choir boy. However, neither man is singly responsible for his crimes either, and the accomplices of both men are sentenced to life imprisonment. That in and of itself says there is something fundamentally wrong with the way the death penalty is meted out.Of course, at this point, her statistics are way out of date. It would be great to see an updated edition. Perhaps the new information could be added as an appendix or perhaps the entire thing could be reworked. In fact, she did release a second book in 2004, one I've yet to read, but even that is five years old at this point. However, even given that numbers she cites are no longer same, the basic points remain the same, and they make this a book worth reading."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12321780-rachel", "userReview": "Okay, wow. What a powerful book. Sister Helen Prejean gave a lecture at my school last month and I got signed copies of this and her other publication. Although during her talk she gave me an idea of what she's all about, I wasn't prepared to feel so emotionally conflicted during the reading of Dead Man Walking. Her talk didn't really convince me, to be honest--all I could think was, these men on Death Row aren't innocent. They did things truly horrific (except, of course, the ones who were wrongly convicted) and they wouldn't be in their situation if they hadn't decided to rape/kidnap/murder others. But reading this book, and spending page after page with Sister Helen and her spiritual advisees, I couldn't help but see how very human these men are. It makes me think about how these men also didn't see or value the humanity in their victims. Sister Helen writes in a beautiful way. It's direct but emotional, and the structure of the book was great. The first 100 pages, especially, up until Pat's execution, were extremely intense and I felt as if I was building a friendship of sorts with him alongside Sister Helen. She worked so very hard to save him from execution, and the tragedy of it never working made me cry as I read about him saying goodbye with \"I love you.\" I didn't have the same feeling with Robert--his crime was much, much more disturbing to me and his personality revolting in a lot of ways (a white supremacist who admires Hitler? Good lord). But she challenges you with him--not all death row inmates are like Pat Sonnier. In fact, probably most of them are like Robert--self-serving, racist and sexist, insensitive to his victim's family, and lacking remorse. But he doesn't deserve to die at the hands of the state any more than Pat Sonnier deserved it. It's not what they did--it's what we, as a society, do. I can't say I'm fully comfortable with any side in this issue of capital punishment. It is so complicated, but Sister Helen presents a deeply moving and persuasive argument here. Her activism (just like Gloria Steinem's) is very inspirational to me."}, {"userName": "Erika Renkes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34589514-erika-renkes", "userReview": "Dead Man Walking is a nonfiction story that grasps the ideals of the death penalty and displays all victims that come from it. From the point of Sister Helen Prejean and her intimate encounters with the death row inmates, one learns how much affects the executions and how much bias is presented throughout the whole process of the capital system. Her tales of her time with Pat Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie really changed my perspective on the death penalty. Before I read this book I was all for it because I felt it could solve murder increase and punish those accordingly to their crimes, but after seeing the death penalty from the point of view of those affected by it, I realized that so much more goes into the execution than finding someone guilty and sentencing them to lethal injection. I found out that the death penalty can never be used fairly because of the bias and the corrupt factors entailing its process. This book changed my opinion because I loved the view it allowed me to see. Sister Helen Prejean was able to open the eyes of the world on what the death penalty really is and honestly there isn't a thing about the book I didn't like because it was so honest and truthful to the death penalty (as I did research on the whole process after reading the book). Her encounters helped shape my stand on capital punishment and open my eyes to what really happens on death row."}, {"userName": "Kacey Koch", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34589255-kacey-koch", "userReview": "Dead Man Walking by Sister Helen Prejean is a nonfiction novel that portrays the cruelty of the death penalty through two inmates she befriended. The main focus of the story is Pat Sonnier who, with his brother, was convicted of the murder and rape of two teenagers. After a rocky court case, Pat was given the death penalty, and his brother Eddy was given life in prison, although he did not kill the kids himself. Throughout the book, Prejean worked to fight the death penalty for Pat, and all of the other inmates on death row.I would rate this book a 5 out of 5 due to its intriguing plot line, and controversy. It is evident that the death penalty has many differing opinions on whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional. Prejean takes a side and supports it to the fullest of her ability, no matter what the consequences may be, or what people say or think of her. She perfectly illustrates the imperfections of the death penalty while creating a story that you can truly sink into.
