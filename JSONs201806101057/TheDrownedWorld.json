Ballard is perhaps better known as the author of two books which became major films\u2014Spielberg's Empire of the Sun and Cronenberg's Crash \u2014he was first praised for a quaternity of post-apocalyptic novels published in the early '60's. The Drowned World (1962), the second book in this series\u2014as well as Ballard's second published novel\u2014was greatly admired by readers of speculative fiction and caused Ballard to be considered one of the great lights of the \u201cNew Wave.\u201dThe Drowned World is often described as a sci-fi version of Heart of Darkness, but if so, it is a topsy-turvy take on the Conrad classic. The world is warming due to an atmospheric erosion caused by events in the sun, and a heat-wave, accompanied by floods, is moving slowly toward the poles. With the heat comes a luxuriance of tropical vegetation, reminscent of the Jurassic period; it seems the Heart of Darkness has come to Old England, not the other way round. When Kurtz (here \u201dStrangman\u201d) arrives from the south in a motorized yacht filled with dark henchman, he is no spent madman expelling a last breath, but an energetic, grinning sociopath intent on looting the last waterlogged treasures of London.The plot is merely serviceable, the character development sketchy, but plot and character are beside the point. What is important here is setting and theme, perfectly realized by Ballard's precise yet poetic prose. His descriptions--of the pitiless sky, of a ghostly submerged observatory, of the flooded streets of London rife with gargantuan plants, and of a collective nightmare where iguana calls to iguana through an eternal tropical forest--remain in memory long after the book is done.Of course, for those enlightened enough to believe in global warming, this is scary stuff, and close attention to Ballard's themes make it into something even scarier. He postulates a world where extreme climate change may act not only upon our superficial behaviors but also upon the neurological structures of the brain. Could the heat and wetness of an atavistic jungle awake the ancient reptile within? Are the iguanas of our dreams calling to each other? Or are they calling to us?"}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201dThe solar disc was no longer a well-defined sphere, but a wide expanding ellipse that fanned out across the eastern horizon like a colossal fire-ball, its reflection turned the dead leaden surface of the lagoon into a brilliant copper shield. By noon, less than four hours away, the water would seem to burn.\u201d\nSolar radiation has melted the polar ice caps, and the oceans have risen to engulf most of the major cities of Europe and America. These cities have become tropical lagoons with only the upper floors of the tallest building sticking up out of the water and silt. Flora and fauna baked by radiation have grown to enormous sizes reminiscent of the Triassic era. A team of scientists have come to investigate and analyze the changes that have occurred in London since humans were forced to flee North. Some of the members of the team start to have strange, primordial dreams. \u201d\u2019What are these nightmares you\u2019ve having?\u2019Beatrice shrugged. \u2018Jungle dreams, Robert,\u2019 she murmured ambiguously. \u2018I\u2019m learning my ABC again. Last night was the delta jungles.\u2019 She gave him a bleak smile, then added with a touch of malicious humour: \u2018Don\u2019t look so stern, you\u2019ll be dreaming them too, soon.\u2019\u201dBallard explains what is happening to the scientists with a bit more detail beyond just calling them jungle dreams. \u201dJust as psychoanalysis reconstructs the original traumatic situation in order to release the repressed material, so we are now being plunged back into the archaeopsychic past, uncovering the ancient taboos and drives that have been dormant for epochs\u2026 Each one of us is as old as the entire biological kingdom, and our bloodstreams are tributaries of the great sea of its total memory.\u201dBeatrice Dahl is a beautiful woman made more lovely by the fact that she is the only female on the expedition. She has found an exquisite apartment that with the help of a generator still has air conditioning and ice. She has a sexual relationship with Dr. Robert Kerans, but she seems rather apathetic about her lover. Of course, it could be the heat. Temperatures climb to 140 degrees by midday. There is a Max Ernst painting on the wall of Beatrice\u2019s apartment, and the longer they are there, the more the painting reminds Kerans of the real world. \nI wonder if the Max Ernst painting was something like this.As the day approaches that they will have to leave, Robert and Beatrice become more convinced that they are going to stay. It doesn\u2019t make any logical sense. Within a matter of months they would be out of fuel to drive the air conditioning and food would begin to be a problem, but the desire to stay and become part of their jungle dreams clutters their thoughts. This novel has a Conradian feel, specifically one of my favorite books Heart of Darkness, so Ballard had my attention from the very first page. I\u2019m a fan of post-apocalyptic books, and J.G. Ballard was obsessed with the worlds that are created by the chaos of destruction. The characters in this novel go against the norm for post-apocalyptic novels. They aren\u2019t resisting the apocalypse. They are intent on joining it. The novel becomes even stranger when some scavengers show up led by the pale, thin man aptly named Strangman.Ballard explores the urges that are normally repressed by civilized human beings. The call of the wild is in our DNA. When we are dipped in the primordial soup of a tropical lagoon, we feel the need to escape the bondages of civilization. Something on a cellular level is telling us that we are missing the fundamental purposes of life. Kerans is intent on escaping the clutches of all that is trying to bind him and head South into the uncertainty of a new world. \n\u201dHis commitment to the future, so far one of choice and plagued by so many doubts and hesitations, was now absolute.\u201d If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Oh, what's left to be said about J. G. Ballard? If you have yet to enter his cult, his realm--please do so soon. The man is dead, and so his sea of work is a limited lake--of placid doom, of absolute apocalypse. He is often imitated--M. Crichton & the new \"Annhilation/Southern Reach\" trilogy guy come to mind, but he is as unique a literary voice as any of the greats. He is, actually, currently under Canonization negotiations by the Crazy Cray-cray Literary Canon.Oh, this dude is inspiring. In \"The Drowned World\", the prehistoric meets the apocalyptic, & the dioramas Mr. Ballard brilliantly forms for us are just so staggeringly real, that I hate the fact that this is not a screenplay. Although the lack of dialogue, & perhaps the clich\u00e9d villain and villain's plot overall, make it no better than some of his weaker short stories*--all immersive, all absolutely extraordinary, but still. I wholly love \"Crash,\" \"High-Rise,\" \"Empire of the Sun\" (which seems to me the most apocalyptic of all his novels, although it's set in WWII), and consider his complete short story collection to be one of the best of all time (its entire 1100 or so pages). There is a heftiness of prose here, and the description is so cinematic that, like I mentioned, I found the medium to be more suitable for a rip-roarin' script. The environment is so lush that it reminds one of \"Fantasia,\" or \"Jurassic Park\", or other cool concoctions of the child-like imagination.

Ballard, what an interesting author, they broke the mold when they made him. When I started reading sf in the 80s I had the impression that Ballard specializes in global ecological disaster scenario, what with The Drowned World, The Burning World, and The Crystal World. A sort of go-to guy for a \u201cdot-dot-dot World\u201d apocalyptic fiction. Then I read Concrete Island and Empire of the Sun and realized Ballard cannot be pigeonholed so simply.The Drowned Worldis one of his earlier novels from his apocalyptic phase. If you are looking for an ecological thriller where masses of people are stampeding away from a gigantic tidal wave, you will need to find a new tree to bark up. While there are some thrilling moments toward the end, on the whole, I would describe the mood of this book as contemplative. From the first chapter most the world has already been submerged, thanks to solar radiation that melted the polar ice-caps. This bit of hard sci-fi is quite well written in the book but subsequent to this exposition the novel is more concerned with the psychological impact on the main characters, particularly Dr. Robert Kerans, through whose point of view the (third person) narrative is focused.For some reason, the environment of the flooded world is causing a gradual regression or devolution on the creatures living on it. People are having bizarre nightmares sparked by racial memories. Later on a piratical villain named Strangman shows up and the beginning of mankind\u2019s mental devolution can be seen through him.This is an intriguing, but not easy to read, book. Something about this book\u2019s narrative tone comes across as rather detached and I could not feel much involvement in the plight of the characters. They are not uninteresting, but none of them is sympathetic. I wonder if this is typical of Ballard\u2019s prose style. I have read a few of his books, but that was decades ago when I was in my teens and I cannot remember much about those books. I do know that he is not a sf author I ever find easy to read like Asimov, Heinlein or Clarke, he is more akin to Le Guin though somewhat less accessible. There is clearly a literary quality to his writing and he often has me reaching for the dictionary.The world of this book is quite vividly described, the image of the drowned cities is quite evocative, and the drained city even more so. There is an odd kind of beauty to it. There are mutated animals and giant insects in this book, but they are a part of the novel\u2019s props rather than monstrosities to be battled.The Drowned World is well worth reading as something unusual and unpredictable. It is one of those rare books that I enjoy more in retrospect when I think about it than while I was actually reading it. It certainly makes want me to read Crash and other Ballard novels I have read and forgotten about."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "This was my introduction to J.G. Ballard. How to best describe this book? I would call it apocalyptic realism. I thought I invented that term until I looked it up, and yes it exists. It's an apocalyptic future that I can see happening, and I imagine it very much like Ballard does here, except my version is tied to climate change and his is caused by a changing sun. Also, it has an eerie similarity to Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I'm certainly looking forward to reading more of Ballard's work."}, {"userName": "Susan Budd", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44131812-susan-budd", "userReview": "The Drowned World was my introduction to Ballard. I don\u2019t know what I liked more: the lavishly described landscape with its swollen sun, primeval jungle, and shrieking iguanas or the inner landscape of recurring dreams, instinctive impulses, and psychological obsessions. It\u2019s the combination of these two worlds\u2014the outer and the inner\u2014that give The Drowned World its depth and hypnotic air. The outer world is described in such poetic prose that a narrative is nearly unnecessary. It is a \u201cvoodoo jungle\u201d (27) with a \u201cstrange dream-like beauty\u201d (30), \u201ca nightmare world of competing organic forms returning rapidly to their Paleozoic past\u201d (31), an \u201cunending succession of green twilights\u201d (31) surrounded by \u201cthe luminous, dragon-green, serpent-haunted sea\u201d (70).The world is undergoing a regression, a devolution to an earlier stage in Earth\u2019s history. In this world of lagoons and equatorial heat, reptiles rule. It is a world without consciousness. This is the world to which Kerans and the others are adapting. This is the world in which each character finds himself in his dreams. As each member of Kerans\u2019 team succumbs to insomnia and isolation, dreams and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the pull of the outer world on the inner world becomes stronger. Everything is sinking back into a pre-conscious state. This self-imposed isolation is \u201cpreparation for a radically new environment, with its own internal landscape and logic, where old categories of thought would merely be an encumbrance\u201d (25).Dr. Bodkin offers a psychological theory for what is happening to them all. He explains to Kerans that the jungle dream they are all having is not a dream \u201cbut an ancient organic memory millions of years old\u201d (89). All the bizarre behavior is the result of \u201cbeing plunged back into the archaeopsychic past, uncovering the ancient taboos and drives that have been dormant for epochs\u201d (56).Ballard\u2019s prose is at its finest when he uses metaphor to merge the outer and inner worlds: \u201cA more important task than mapping the harbours and lagoons of the external landscape was to chart the ghostly deltas and luminous beaches of the submerged neuronic continents\u201d (58).This is where I went from being spellbound by the prose to being fascinated by the theories of consciousness, dreams, and memory. As a poet and a philosopher, these are the areas that most intrigue me and inspire my creative work. But for all my delight with the first half of Ballard\u2019s novel, the second half left me wishing he had written it as a novella, leaving out the ninety or so pages about Strangman and his crew. The book didn\u2019t need these action scenes. It already had atmosphere and ideas. I believe these chapters detract from the phantasmagoric quality of the novel. Yet they do have some redeeming value. The behavior of Strangman\u2019s crew is atavistic, primitive. It is the behavior of men only just emerging from their pre-conscious origins, their emerging consciousness still half-submerged in the swampy amniotic fluid of the collective human race\u2014instinctual, tribal, and superstitious. But instead of evolving, Strangman\u2019s men are devolving. Instead of emerging from their pre-conscious origins, they are slipping back into it. Towards the end, the novel returns to the theme of isolation and the dream-like unreality that accompanies it. And this brings the novel to a satisfying conclusion. The \u201cdormant magic and mesmeric power\u201d (59) of The Drowned World has cast its spell over me."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "Ballard wrote this dystopian novel in the early 1960s, but it is still resonant today and it deals with a drastic increase in temperature on the earth; it is set in 2145. The premise is fairly simple; temperatures have greatly increased and the polar icecaps melted; temperatures around the equator can reach well over 150 degrees. Most life is centred on the polar areas. Jungle proliferates and evolution has goes into overdrive with some insects, reptiles and plants developing and changing very quickly. Great banks of silt have also developed with great lagoons surrounded by jungle. At the start of the book a team of scientists and military personnel are studying a series of lagoons set in jungle over what was the city of London; which is many feet below the lagoons.The main character is Robert Kerans, a biologist. He has moved up from the makeshift camp to the top floor of the Ritz, the top floors being above water. He spends time with two others in particular; Dr Bodkin (a scientist) and Beatrice Dahl who is rather reclusive and has taken the top floor of another hotel. There are plenty of descriptions of heat and exotic wildlife. A number of members of the staff start to get dreams which seem to draw them to the sun and the south and which seem to point to a collective unconscious and impulses which go back to prehistoric times. Obviously Ballard is playing with Jungian ideas about the unconscious. Kerans, Bodkin and Dahl remain when the main party leaves and they continue to lead a fairly solitary existence. This is disrupted when a large boat arrives captained by Strangman; a white man, dressed all in white, with an all black crew. Strangman is dangerous and unpredictable. Some high jinks ensue, but the primeval instincts are strong. I thought I had laid Heart of Darkness to rest last year; but here we are again!! Ballard has denied being influenced by it, but it\u2019s clearly there for all to see. It is also possible that the influence is early H G Wells, as Conrad was also influenced by Wells; novels such as The Time Machine. The main characters are also like time travellers transported back to primeval times. Although the contrast here is different to Heart of Darkness where the jungle is threatening and other. Here the impulse is to return to the jungle, the primeval home.There are links to Lord of the Flies and Robinson Crusoe and Strangman can be seen as a parody of Crusoe. Strangman is looting the treasures of the submerged city. Water and the sea are potent symbols here and Ballard puts words from Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land (Death by Water) into Strangman\u2019s mouth; There's nothing much left now\u2014I can tell you,  I sometimes feel like Phlebas the Phoenician. Though that's really your role, isn't it? A current under sea Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell He passed the stages of his age and youth Entering the whirlpool.\"Strangman also quotes Donne (Eliot was a great promoter of Donne) and alludes to the following;\u201cWho bends not his ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? But who can remove it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this world? No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee\u201dBallard makes reference to a number of other works; Camus, Kierkegaard, Ulysses and Homer to name a few. There are elements of the Grail Quest as well. There sometimes seems to be an element of, to adapt a rather British saying, throwing in everything including the kitchen sink. It\u2019s clever stuff and Ballard\u2019s vision is very prescient. It is also well written and the impulse is to move back into the Darkness as if going back to the womb or back to primeval impulses. However we still have a white man in charge of a ship with a crew of black men dancing to his tune. Perhaps we have not moved on so far after all. That really irritated me."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "The Drowned World is one of four novels J. G. Ballard wrote about the same time about the environment. Published in 1962, it seems prophetic, in that it proposes that global warming would melt the polar ice caps, and the resulting raised sea level would drown cities. One interesting thing about the book is that the cause as Ballard has it in this book is that solar storms\u2014known to affect Earth weather\u2014become so severe that they scorch the planet. This theory roughly aligns with the current 1% (or right-wing, pro-biz) view that climate change (if it exists at all!) is not man-made, it\u2019s just a part of What Happens. Ballard tries out the man-made theory in his next book, Drought (1964).The Drowned World introduces us to Dr. Robert Kearns, as the world heats up. It\u2019s 180 degrees at the equator, and in London, it approaches 130 degrees at each mid-day. The roughly five million remaining people in the world are mostly heading north, to the remaining Arctic and Antarctic circles, where the average temperature is 85 degrees. A group of military men connected to Kearns are heading north. Kerans, who has a kind of vague relationship with Beatrice, lives in the Ritz, tenth floor, though the rising water is at the seventh floor. They\u2014and a fellow scientist, Dr Bodkin--decide to stay, though this is suicide, on some level. They have some supplies, but the heat is getting unbearable, back to Triassic Age levels. Flora and fauna are burgeoning; animals such as iguanas and alligators are getting huge. The theory is that the combination of heat and more water would create a kind of hothouse effect, not hospitable for humans. Many of these folks also seem to be dreaming similar dreams, of swamps and lagoons from ages past, connecting as Ballard has it to the Collective Unconscious, a sort of weird psycho-biological ideology. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a true dream, but an ancient organic memory millions of years old. The innate releasing mechanisms laid down in your cytoplasm have been awakened. The expanding sun and rising temperatures are driving you back down to the spinal levels into the drowned seas of the lowest layers of your unconscious, into the entirely new zone of the neuronic psyche. This is the lumbar transfer, total psychic recall. We really remember these swamps and lagoons.\u201dKerans sees the clock turning back through Deep Time to something primitive, but also something spiritually purer than contemporary society. Here\u2019s another taste of this kind of thinking from Kerans:\u201cThe brief span of an individual life is misleading. Each one of us is as old as the entire biological kingdom, and our bloodstreams are tributaries of the great sea of its total memory. The uterine odyssey of the growing foetus recapitulates the entire evolutionary past, and its central nervous system is a coded time scale, each nexus of neurones and each spinal level marking a symbolic station, a unit of neuronic time.\u201d After the others leave, a group of pirates, scavengers, \u201csavages,\u201d show up, led by a guy named Strangman. Until then, I think all of the people are white, but many of these wild drunken looters are black; seems possibly racist to me, in a kind of Heart of Darkness kinda way. Until then, Kerans, Beatrice and Bodkin have romanticized staying in dying London, until Strangman and his Wild Boys come in. No more sixties romantic vision of the future return to Hothouse Eden: \u201c. . . we are now being plunged back into the archaeopsychic past, uncovering the ancient taboos and drives that have been dormant for epochs.\u201d This is suddenly Jules Verne\u2019s Twenty Thousand Leagues turning into the dark, sinister world of Lord of the Flies, or the Heart of Darkness, where Kerans is lost, wandering, a \"second Adam searching for the forgotten paradises of the reborn Sun.\u201dI like the world building in this more than the story or mystical ideas. I liked the references to painting throughout, especially Ballard\u2019s focus on the work of surrealists from Max Ernst and Paul Delvaux and others. Unreason reigns. As the madness of Strangman ruins Kerans\u2019s happy vision of psycho-biological devolution, we can see that some of the darkest dimensions of surrealism are an influence on Ballard. This becomes a pretty scary short dystopian book I am glad I finally read with my Cli-Fi (for Climate Change Fiction, you wannabe hipsters!) students. I liked it early on, thought it was too weird for awhile, then liked it as it got darker, actually. 3.5, rounded up."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4111201-kathy", "userReview": "Dear Kerans, Here's an idea - go up to Hampstead. It'll be dry there and you can walk about.The first couple of chapters of this book are quite intriguing, but as soon as you realise that this is central London and the buildings aren't even fully submerged, you know that the rest of Britain IS STILL THERE. So why is everyone acting like the world has been drowned? Didn't JG Ballard have the first notion of physical geography? DUH! Schoolboy error. When London drowns, you can say goodbye to East Anglia, Holland, Belgium and Denmark, but most of the rest of Britain and mainland Europe won't even have it's feet wet. Birmingham, for example, is 140 metres above sea level. Go figure.Even if you can get past that one, you will probably be tripped up by some other little problems - like there is no effort made to create plausible characters, the only woman is portrayed in a completely sexist way, the whole thing is deeply racist and nothing much happens - at great and tedious length. Or maybe it's that whatever happens seems to make you feel like you couldn't care less. In a world where men mess about in boats without any evident purpose. Detail. Detail. More and more descriptions of water and seaweed and silt. WHAT FOR?

It takes something of his Empire of the Sun experiences of a world turned upside down and crosses it with Heart of Darkness with a similar sense of a journey both back in time and into the psyche.

Once the set is changed, then the actors start to play different parts.In the camp the adults lost their authority but for the children this was simply a new world. They were adaptable and through themselves in to the new situation with abandon. Ballard and his family only ended up captured by the Japanese because they were part of the European expatriate community in Shanghai and Ballad notes in the edition of the novel I read the influence upon him of seeing the flat countryside transformed in to a great inland sea during the spring floods - the stage set of human society is subject to ecology and the environment an idea which plays out in The Drowned World but also in The Drought and maybe some of Ballard's other early novels. These early experiences might have shaped how he constructs his principal characters. They are rarely heroic, instead like Ballard as a boy, they bear witness or partake in chains of events that are beyond their own control. The changed stage set in The Drowned World is that rising sea levels and temperatures are forcing humanity to migrate to the polar regions. The climate of the planet is reverting to that of a much earlier stage of the earth's evolution. The characters of the novel are a survey team mapping and exploring the remains of London, now a literal fetid steaming swamp. Under the influence of the changing climatic conditions the characters experience strange dreams.However beyond that it is not very satisfying. The sense of the unheimlich is not as sustained as in Crash - by then Ballard doesn't feel the need to change the stage set in a dramatic manner simply to show it to us from a different angle to show us it's oddness and spin the heimlich into its opposite - and the Black and White Minstrels style pirates are jarring, though if one were feeling generous one could with the passage of time point to that as another example of evolutionary regression embodied in the text."}, {"userName": "Stuart", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart", "userReview": "The Drowned World: Diving into the pellucid depths of our racial memoriesOriginally posted at Fantasy LiteratureThe Drowned World (1962) is J.G. Ballard\u2019s best apocalyptic work, the other two being The Burning World (1964) and The Crystal World (1966), but if you are thinking of an action-packed adventure where a plucky group of survivors clings to decency amid the collapse of civilization, this is the wrong book. Ballard was interested in \u2018inner space,\u2019 and while he sometimes adopted SF tropes in his books and short stories, his works most often featured natural disasters, the collapse of civilization, lonely astronauts, grim future urban landscapes, and weird obsessions with technology and mechanization. His main intent was to explore the psychology of human beings trapped in modern urban societies (and what happens when these societies collapse), and most of his protagonists are fatalistic, detached, and not particularly concerned about saving the world. It would very interesting to compare this to Emily St. John Mandel\u2019s Station Eleven (2014), since both are literary works that employ genre elements but have vastly different agendas and conclusions about the human condition.J.G. Ballard is probably best known for his autobiographical novel Empire of the Sun (1984), relating the story of when he and his family were living in Shanghai and were placed in a Japanese internment camp during WWII. The book was made into a film by Stephen Spielberg in 1987, which brought the author much greater attention than before. However, his importance to the SF genre dates back to the early 1960s and 1970s, when he was a pivotal figure in the New Wave movement (inspired by experimental writers like William S. Burroughs), known for his efforts to inject more literary themes to a genre previously known for rocket ships, robots, and aliens. In 1962 he said \u201cscience fiction should turn its back on space, on interstellar travel, extra-terrestrial life forms, (and) galactic wars\u201d. However, his focus on bleak psychological inner landscapes was certainly not always welcome to SF readers looking for fun, exciting escapes to exotic worlds. So there are plenty of people who don\u2019t want Ballard associated with the genre, and my impression is that the author himself didn\u2019t have a particularly close relationship with traditional SF fandom. He was, however, closely associated with New Worlds, a British SF magazine edited by Michael Moorcock from the early 1960s. Other major New Wave writers include Samuel R. Delany, Roger Zelazny, Harlan Ellison, Ursula K. LeGuin, Robert Silverberg, Thomas M. Disch, Joanna Russ, James Tiptree Jr. (Alice Sheldon), and many others. Ballard said in a 1962 New Worlds article:I\u2019ve often wondered why s-f shows so little of the experimental enthusiasm which has characterized painting, music and the cinema during the last four or five decades, particularly as these have become wholeheartedly speculative, more and more concerned with the creation of new states of mind, constructing fresh symbols and languages where the old cease to be valid.The biggest developments of the immediate future will take place, not on the Moon or Mars, but on Earth, and it is inner space, not outer, that need to be explored. The only truly alien planet is Earth. In the past the scientific bias of s-f has been towards the physical sciences \u2013 rocketry, electronics, cybernetics \u2013 and the emphasis should switch to the biological sciences. Accuracy, that last refuge of the unimaginative, doesn\u2019t matter a hoot. \u2026It is that inner space-suit which is still needed, and it is up to science fiction to build it!Although I cannot describe the full impact of New Wave SF on the genre itself in the context of this review, suffice to say that it had a strong reaction among SF readers and writers. It introduced new literary approaches to the traditional Golden Age stories and imagery, so the field now features a wide range of themes and styles, both old-school and experimental. Regardless of why type of SFF you prefer, it\u2019s undeniable that the field matured and expanded tremendously during that period of the 60s and 70s. It\u2019s no coincidence that society and the world itself were also undergoing profound changes as well.In any case, let\u2019s get back to The Drowned World. The story outline is quite simple. An increase in solar flare activity has melted the polar ice caps, increasing ocean levels and flooding most cities and coastlines around the world. Mass migrations, starvation, conflicts, and chaos have reigned, but Ballard dispatches that period in a few pen-strokes, taking us far into the future of 2154 and a flooded London dominated by lagoons, tropical plants, lizards, bats, and intense heat and humidity. The city is deserted other than a scattering of human scavengers and eccentric holdouts. Our protagonist is biologist Dr. Robert Kerans, who is part of a small scientific survey team sent to catalog the flora and fauna of this transformed landscape. Here is a description from the book:All the way down the creek, perched in the windows of the office blocks and department stores, the iguanas watched them go past, their hard frozen heads jerking stiffly\u2026 Without the reptiles, the lagoons and the creeks of office blocks half-submerged in the immense heat would have had a strange dream-like beauty, but the iguanas and basilisks brought the fantasy down to earth. As their seats in the one-time board-rooms indicated, the reptiles had taken over the city. Once again they were the dominant form of life.Along with fellow scientist Dr. Bodkin, his only other companion is Beatrice Dahl, a woman who occupies one of the abandoned hotels and lives a life of bored decadence and ennui, living off the stored food supplies of a collapsed civilization, along with portable generators to power the A/C systems that can sustain comfort amid temperatures that reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. The two scientists languidly catalog their discoveries, but it is clear that this activity is pointless, because humanity will likely never reconquer the lost cities of its peak. There is also a military unit dispatched with them, partly for protection and partly to explore. However, Dr. Kierans and his companions begin to experience strange dreams of ancient lagoons and jungles, which they theorize come from humanity\u2019s racial consciousness of events as far back as the Triassic Age. It seems far-fetched, but Ballard writes about it with conviction and detail:And how else can you explain the universal but completely groundless loathing of the spider, only one species of which has ever been known to sting? Or hatred of snakes and reptiles? Simply because we all carry within us a submerged memory of the time when the giant spiders were lethal, and when the reptiles were the planet\u2019s dominant life form.These are the oldest memories on earth, the time codes carried in every chromosome and gene. Every step we\u2019ve taken in our evolution is a milestone inscribed with organic memories. From the enzymes controlling the carbon-dioxide cycle, to the organization of the brachial plexus and the nerve pathways of the pyramid cells of the mid-brain. Each is a record of a thousand decisions taken in a chemical crisis.Just as psychoanalysis reconstructs the original traumatic situation in order to release the repressed material, so we are now being plunged back into the archaeopsychic past, uncovering the ancient taboos and drives that have been dormant for epochs.Ballard dives deep into his understanding of the human unconscious, and while it may not be in keeping with current schools of thought, and I unfortunately am not familiar with Jungian or Freudian psychology, I certainly found his ideas intriguing and seductive while listening to the audiobook, to the point where I went to the trouble to transcribe these passages for your reading pleasure: The brief span of an individual life is misleading. Each one of us is as old as the entire biological kingdom, and our bloodstreams are tributaries of the great sea of its total memory. The uterine odyssey of the growing foetus recapitulates the entire evolutionary past, and its central nervous system is a coded time scale, each nexus of neurones and each spinal level marking a symbolic station, a unit of neuronic time.The further down the Central Nervous System you move, from the hindbrain through the medulla into the spinal cord, you descend back into the neuronic past. For example, the junction between the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae\u2026 is the great zone of transit between the gill-breathing fish and the air-breathing amphibians with their respiratory ribcages, the very junction where we stand now on the shores of this lagoon, between the Paleozoic and the Triassic Eras.If you like, you could call this the psychology of total equivalence, let\u2019s say neuronics for short, and dismiss it as biological fantasy. However, I am convinced as we move back through geophysical time, so we reenter the amnionic corridor, and move back through spinal and archeopsychic time, recollecting in our unconscious minds the landscapes of each epoch, each with a distinct ecological terrain, its own flora and fauna, as recognizable to anyone else as they would be to a traveler in a Wellsian time machine. Except that this is no scenic railway, but a total reorientation of the personality. If we let these buried phantoms master us as we reappear, we\u2019ll be swept back helplessly in the floodtide like pieces of flotsam.When the military unit insists on returning north, Dr. Kierans and his companions contrive to remain in the enervating, intense heat of London. They encounter a sinister group of scavengers led by a diabolic but charming figure named Strangman, who takes a liking to Kierans and Beatrice in the hopes that they will share knowledge of where to find the best treasures in the drowned city. They dive to explore a submerged planetarium, which is described in hypnotic detail that explicitly recalls a return to the womb, but Kierans also experiences a near-death incident, which does not seem to overly concern him. When Strangman finds a way to shore up a lagoon and drain it, the exposed city is like the unveiling of the unconscious and breaking of the dream state that Kierans and his companions have fallen into. Fellow biologist Bodkins describes it well: To use the symbolic language of Bodkin\u2019s scheme, he would then be abandoning the conventional estimates of time in relation to his own physical needs, and entering the world of total neuronic time, where the massive intervals of the geological timescale calibrated his existence. Here, a million years was the shortest working unit, and the problems of food and clothing were as irrelevant as they would have been to a Buddhist contemplative lotus-squatting before an empty rice bowl under the protective canopy of the million-headed cobra of eternity.That wasn\u2019t a true dream, but an ancient organic memory millions of years old. The innate releasing mechanisms laid down in your cytoplasm have been awakened. The expanding sun and rising temperatures are driving you back down to the spinal levels into the drowned seas of the lowest layers of your unconscious, into the entirely new zone of the neuronic psyche. This is the lumbar transfer, total psychic recall. We really remember these swamps and lagoons. Finally, Kierans and Beatrice find themselves alone, freed from both the military unit and Strangman\u2019s gang, and instead of the credits rolling as they look hopefully into the future, planning to rebuild civilization and learn from the mistakes of the past (like every ridiculous Hollywood post-apocalyptic fable), they instead languidly slip back into their neuronic past, satisfied to lose themselves in antiquity.The continued increase in temperature and the enervating humidity made it almost impossible to leave the hotel after ten o\u2019clock in the morning. The lagoons and the jungle were filled with fire until four o\u2019clock, by when he was usually too tired to do anything but return to bed. All day he sat by the shuttered windows of the suites, listening from the shadows to shifting movement of mesh cage as it expanding and contracted with the heat.Already many of the surrounding buildings had disappeared beneath the proliferating vegetation. Huge club mosses and calamites blotted out the white rectangular faces, shading the lizards in their window lairs. Beyond the lagoon, the endless tides of silt had begun to accumulate into enormous glittering banks, here and there overtopping the shoreline like the immense tippings of some distant goldmine. The light drummed against his brain, bathing the submerged levels below his consciousness, carrying him downwards to warm pellucid depths, where the nominal realities of time and space ceased to exist. Guided by his dreams, he was moving back into his emergent past, through a succession of ever stranger landscapes centered on the lagoon, each of which seemed to represent one of his own spinal levels.At times the circle of water was spectral and vibrant, at others slack and murky. The shore apparently formed of shale, like the dull, metallic skin of a reptile. Yet again the soft beaches would glow invitingly with a glassy carmine sheen, the sky warm and limpid, the emptiness of the long stretches of sand total and absolute, filling with an exquisite and tender anguish. He longed for this descent into psycheoneuronic time to reach its conclusion, repressing the knowledge that when it did, the external world would become alien and unbearable.There\u2019s no question that The Drowned World is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but I think it\u2019s also fair to say that he wrote some of the strangest and most challenging books that have been associated with SF, even though many would reject them. The New Wave movement has left its mark on the genre.The most extreme examples of Ballard would be Crash (1973), his bizarre tribute to the eroticism of the car crash that was filmed by David Cronenberg in 1996, and The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), an experimental collection of \u2018condensed novels\u2019 that was so controversial that Nelson Doubleday has the entire first US printing destroyed out of concerns for legal action, since stories had titles like \u201cPlans for the Assassination of Jacqueline Kennedy,\u201d \u201cLove and Napalm: Export USA,\u201d and \u201cWhy I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan.\u201d I doubt I would ever want to read these books, but it is important to note that they were written."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1497350-kathryn", "userReview": "[acceptance and desire to remain and eventually move South (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Simon Fay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13080935-simon-fay", "userReview": "There was a time in science fiction when scientists were attractive square-jawed types. Not quite as cool as James Bond, but certainly as confident in their abilities, and no less successful with the women they met.J.G. Ballard's The Drowned World comes on the heels of this trend - while one foot is routed firmly in the past, another is stretched well into the future, even beyond what a lot of contemporary science fiction writers would attempt to accomplish today.The protagonist of the piece is a geologist.The world around him has melted and become a swampy tropical ocean. However, the apocalyptic conditions have not created a dystopia that one man will find himself crushed under. There is no totalitarian government to rebel against and no great cause to fight for. Survival and escape are the only objectives a rational man can hope for. That alone would make for a compelling premise, but Ballard elevates it beyond its B-movie tropes with a delicious twist... his classic protagonist is not necessarily a rational man.The Drowned World is dripping with doom. Every sentence on every page oozes with the condensation of a planet sweltering to death. The page count must be close to 300, and even as Ballard layers the prose with evocative descriptions of the sultry climate, the sheer repetitiveness of the enviroment transforms the reader to a quivering pulp. As we travel with the geologist down the river to find his heart of darkness, we don't observe him grow as a person or solve the global disaster, but rather, we become pummeled, as he does, by the baking heat and tranquilized by the madness that surrounds him.It's been a while since I read the book. By the nature of it I'm sure I was bored at times.

The flood is coming. Get your paddles, ladies. In the meantime, read this book. What is it? Hmm. Apart from the sumptuous descriptions of ooze, silt and lizards, there\u2019s a fight-for-survival plot for the first 70 pages, a strange romance sub-plot for more pages, a swashbuckling pirate adventure for 50-odd pages, and an all-out action thriller starring Kevin Costner for other pages, mainly towards the end.

Do you think of spaceships, lasers, phasers, light-sabres? Rockets, robots, and radon gas? Green chicks and blue boxes? Science fiction is a genre built upon difference. Science fiction stories are essentially thought experiments in which the author asks what would happen if the world were different in one or many ways.We often (rightly) associate science fiction with fantastic technologies, but that kind of mental picture is a rather poor description of the entire genre. There's so much science fiction that emphasizes the psychological over the physical, taking us on a journey deep into our minds instead of out among the stars. I have to confess to having a bias toward the former type, even though I know that many examples of the latter type are truly outstanding. Perhaps that's the problem though. Perhaps the former type of science fiction, in emphasizing a technological apotheosis, permits us to marginalizing it as a form of acknowledged fantasy, whereas the latter is more \"literary,\" more \"mainstream,\" more \"down-to-earth,\" if you will.The Drowned World is rooted firmly in this camp. The technology seems little different from that of contemporary Earth. Rather, the change comes from the external environment, a result of massive global warming caused by solar radiation. Earth's equatorial regions are reverting to \"Triassic age\" climates, and the transformation has reached as far north as London. The main characters are at home among an alien landscape, but aside from this change of scenery, the people and their devices are much like that available in the present day, right down to .38 revolvers.The scenery is merely a catalyst for the true source of the science fiction. The Drowned World chronicles three people's attempts to process the genetic memory of the Triassic age, passed down to them by their mammalian ancestors. The similarities in environment stimulate their brains, first causing intense dreams that soon transform into a sort of waking sleep. The minds of the characters are, in some ways, regressing back toward the Triassic, even while their physical forms remain human.In that sense, The Drowned World raises the question\u2014as much of its ilk in this type of science fiction do\u2014of how much of the events in the story actually happen. How much is \"real\" and how much is a half-remembered, half-hallucinated waking dream of the protagonist? Ballard emphasizes the unreliable nature of the narrative by drawing attention to actions of Kerans' that he questions after the fact, concluding that he has no explanation for why he acted that way.Particularly, in one of the most lugubrious and haunting scenes of the book, Kerans has dived to the bottom of a lagoon to explore a deserted planetarium. He secures his air line around a door handle to keep it from dragging in the silt, and when he goes too far, the line snags and chokes off his air, causing him to black out. After being rescued, Kerans realizes he doesn't know if the incident was an accident, foul play by the people on the surface, or a suicide attempt. Constantly questioning his motivations, Kerans always seems to be on the cusp of metamorphosis, striving constantly toward a transformation that eludes him. In contrast, Bodkin's emotional closeness to London, considering it home, seems to maroon him in the near past instead of allowing transcendence toward the Triassic; and Beatrice . . . well, I don't know what to make of Beatrice.Although The Drowned World has much in the way of atmosphere, by its very nature it is somewhat inscrutable, and thus frustrating. It reminds me of the work of H.G. Wells, particularly The Island of Dr. Moreau. Like Wells, Ballard's protagonist is a competent, well-educated male who engages in a struggle for survival in an isolated, technologically-limited setting. Along the way, the book explores environmental and social themes (more environmental in this case). Both books examine the nature of humanity through the nature of mind and memory. And The Drowned World has a similar narrative style\u2014while not first person, it has that same mixture of factual, journalism-like tones and artistic, surrealist overtures.Ballard's capacity for description, whether it is mood or setting, is by and large the strongest part of this book. Not only does he give a good account of the new, lagoon-filled London, but he simultaneously delves into the minds of his characters (or at least, Kerans) and scrutinizes their motivations. It is a good thing too, because the relative isolation of the characters means there is comparatively little dialogue. Ballard's description and narration keeps The Drowned World moving, even when he spends pages depicting the stillness of a scene.Unfortunately, The Drowned World doesn't always sustain the tension it tries to build. Ballard raises intriguing questions, but he never seems to take them to a satisfactory concluding point\u2014or at least, if he does, he does not convince me. At the end, I'm left questioning the point of the journey. How exactly has Kerans changed? What is the significance of this surrender to the pre-uterine memories? The psychology underlying the book is interesting but not as fleshed out as I would want.Likewise, I found the conflicts between Kerans and Strangman lacklustre. Part of the reason I draw the comparison with Wells is because the conflict seems there because it's expected, like Ballard is following a well-tread plot and grafting his psychological themes to the existing structure. This unsuccessful melding is a crack that begins to undermine my confidence in the rest of the book. Suddenly I wonder about Kerans' indecisiveness\u2014he doesn't want to leave, then he does want to leave, then he doesn't want to leave, then he leaves . . . like many stories, it is a difficult\u2014and subjective\u2014call: is this a brilliant illustration of learned helplessness or indicative of great writing married to a mediocre story?Despite its environmental themes, The Drowned World is not post-apocalyptic, nor does it really look at how the rest of society has adapted to the mass exodus induced by global warming. It is, at its core, a look at the psyche of the individual, especially the isolated one. And that's cool. I was expecting something more, though. I was expecting profound\u2014and I got profound. Yet I was expecting something moving, something that professed purpose . . . and that has eluded me here.The Drowned World reads like a classic, channelling the style of H.G. Wells to conjure a different, somewhat eerie atmosphere of otherness. But the style lacks enough substance to support it; ultimately, the story falls flat."}, {"userName": "J.G. Keely", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely", "userReview": "The problem with writing a racially-charged tale of madness and death, lost deep in an alien and antagonistic jungle is that you're going to draw comparisons to 'Heart of Darkness', and that's not a comparison from which many novelists are going to emerge unscathed. The white men lose themselves in the brutality of the primordial past, going 'native', or even beyond native, but Ballard cannot match the furious voice or psychological insights of Conrad.Ballard distinguishes himself as a competent and bold author, his style easily outdistancing his sci fi contemporaries. His prose is strong, his use of science thoughtful and inspired, and his setting intriguing. Of course, the very notion of a 'drowned world' is a bit suspect, as any researches into Nasa's water level software show: even with the most generous estimates, there just isn't enough water to cover it all. In a more fantastical book, like Kavan's Ice, we can take for granted that the setting is symbolic, not literal, but Ballard takes a more realistic approach. His use of constant, running floods alleviates some of that problem, and there still is land, made remote not just by water, but by temperature.Generally, as temperature rises grow more extreme, they tend to affect colder regions more than warm ones. In the Eocine, when the poles were warm year round and the ice caps entirely melted, the temperature variance from equator to pole was relatively slight--a continuous rainforest ran from pole to pole. The temperature increase had a more pronounced effect on the cold areas than the warm ones, meaning temperatures at the equator rose a small amount, while those at the poles rose a great amount.In the Mesozoic, a great deal of the high temperatures were the result of a combination of carbon effects and the fact that there was only a single landmass surrounded by water. Coastal regions always have less temperature variance, especially with the sorts of constant storms described in Ballard's book. These storms would also act to deflect a great deal of the sun's heat, especially as they seem to be concentrated around the equatorial regions. But these are relatively minor concerns, and Ballard's setting was strong enough to suspend disbelief, and did not delve too deeply into explanation or theory.His sweltering jungle world is reminiscent of Armina's Garden: the place which is too green, too full of life, so vibrant and pulsing that it grows dangerous. Everything is wet, overgrown rot, the sort of place that birthed malaria, an overabundance of frantic, competitive live for which soft man is hardly suited. His sci fi contribution to this trope is the metaphor of the primordial womb: the return to an earlier state. In this he evokes the early Twilight Zone notion of 'reversible evolution', though his depiction is less ridiculous.But Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' also posits a return to an earlier psychological state, a reversion in which the 'civilized' white men grow even more brutal and depraved than they imagine the natives to be. And like Conrad, Ballard tries to trace this reversion through the psychology of his isolated, increasingly inhuman characters.But Ballard's psychology is not as variable, not as complex. The characters all speak in the same tones, all make the same sorts of observations, and all seem instantly to comprehend one another's minds. He seems to be trying to build a continuous, shared psychology for these latter men, to paint his reversion in absolute terms, but it is all a bit convenient, and undermines the conflicts between the characters. Their inner thoughts are explained to us, their speech prefaced by redundant adverbs.And this exposition is a part of his general style. His great central metaphor is also brought up often, then explained matter-of-factly. It is not an undercurrent but a tangible presence in the book, something overt which all the characters seem to understand implicitly. Yet each time we see it, we are not getting a new, contrasting view, as Conrad would give us, but the same images and observations, over and over.His use of figurative language is mixed. Though it sometimes hits the right mark, the constant repetition means that much of it becomes stale. some authors use such repetition to lull us, to create a poetic style where certain words, through repetition, gain more meaning over time. The author can use the word to invoke a series of related ideas and then add another layer or provide a contrasting observation.Through such a style, authors can create a dreamlike feel, pervaded with ideas. While Ballard can be dreamlike, he breaks up this mood by his over-explanation. The problem is, if a motif must be explained every time it is brought up, that indicates that the author has not properly established it. Instead of progressing through the idea as the story goes on, the author keeps dragging us backward.It felt like Ballard wanted to talk about it, but every time he returned to it, he found he had nothing new to say. Part of this might be because the book was expanded from a smaller story, but I'm not convinced it needed expansion. If anything, it could use some editing down.Ballard does have a literary sensibility that I respect, and I appreciated his mythological allusions, but I didn't feel like this book was a concise exploration of the concepts he brought up. We start off hard sci fi, then quickly drop into what seems like a mystical exploration of the mind, then Ballard leaves that on the back-burner for a bit of suspenseful adventure.There isn't really a good balance between the slow, psychological introspection and the basic adventure plot, and due to repetition, the introspection rarely elevates the story above what it might otherwise be."}, {"userName": "Kostas Papadatos", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26165640-kostas-papadatos", "userReview": "\u0397 -\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1- \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03b7, \u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 \u03b7 \u03b3\u03b7 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03cd\u03be\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2.\u0388\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b8\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.\u0397 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7. \u039f Ballard \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5..\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc..\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03b4\u03ac\u03c7\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03baw\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2.

Silt. Heat. Floodwaters. And plants. Gonzo, all conquering plants spreading across a doomed earth. These are the images that stuck in my mind after reading  The Drowned World. If you\u2019re looking for something uplifting I advise you to look elsewhere - you\u2019re unlikely to crack a smile at any point in this grim story. However, if you don't mind reading under a futile-struggle-against-implacable-forces cloud then Ballard's book is well worth your time - its a skilfully told story full of vivid images brightly lit by a tyrannical, scorching sun.In our era of climate change  The Drowned World seems to be less a novel than a prediction. In Ballard\u2019s future the polar ice caps are long gone and the world is a baking greenhouse riven by ever expanding uninhabitable equatorial storm belts. Billions are dead and the last real human settlements cling to the poles, where temperatures are still bearable. While Ballard\u2019s reason for this occurrence is not anthropogenic - unusual solar activity has partly stripped earth\u2019s atmosphere away \u2013 the result is similar to those posited by worst-case scenario climate change models; a hostile planet no longer able to support human life.Yes, you've seen this scenario, more or less, many times before (Paolo Bacigalupi did it well with his near-submerged Bangkok in The Windup Girl), but Ballard goes further than your typical climate-change-ruined-my-civilisation dystopia.The Drowned World is more than an environmental apocalypse story \u2013 it\u2019s a psychological journey, working from the premise that as our world becomes hotter and more like the sultry, reptile-friendly Triassic era human minds begin to revert back to pre-historic instincts and behaviours buried deep in our brains (Did you see that coming? I certainly didn\u2019t!). Essentially the massive environmental changes that occur in the external world have corresponding changes in the internal emotional and mental world of human beings.The story focuses on Robert Kerans, a member of a research team sent to an inundated future London to investigate the changes that have occurred as the climate has shifted. From the early stages of the story, where Kerans occupies the top floors of a luxury hotel jutting from the floodwaters - its faded grandeur and sputtering aircon are a fantastic contrast with the oppressive tropics of the new London and it\u2019s Iguana infested swamps \u2013 Ballard sets a memorable and unnerving scene. The longer Kerans and others in the expedition stay in the heat and stink of the postdiluvian city the more they change, their minds and instincts slowly warping to fit the new environmental paradigm.The Drowned World is great read, and it's hard to believe that it was written in 1962. Ballard\u2019s book has aged well, with few of the annoying tells that often infest older sci-fi works (reel-to-reel tape systems in the year 2264, characters chain-smoking Camels in their spacecraft, that kind of thing). Ballard is a hell of a writer and he drew me right in, keeping me glued to the book right to the inevitably bleak end. I\u2019m a winter person, fond of snow and long coats, so the ceaselessly sweltering earth of The Drowned World would be a special kind of hell for me, a hell that is vividly and memorably evoked."}, {"userName": "sologdin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin", "userReview": "Nutshell: though global warming wins, cagey survivors succumb only to evopsychomachia. Global warming is merely the Luca Brasi of a villainous sun, whose \u201csudden instability\u201d \u201cenlarged the Van Allen belts and diminished Earth\u2019s gravitational hold upon the outer layers of the ionosphere\u201d (33). Increased radiation dicked up the temperature, accelerated plant growth, and mutated the fuck outta everyone else (id.). The heat afflicted routine hydrologies, and now \u201cthe Middle West of the United States, filled with the Mississippi as it drained the Rocky Mountains, became an enormous gulf opening into the Hudson Bay, while the Caribbean Sea was transformed into a desert of silt and salt flats. Europe became a system of giant lagoons\u201d (34). About five million human persons remain, living mostly on the poles (35). So, yeah, the normal post-apocalyptic Setting, which, as we shall recall, sucks as a rule, being filled with inarticulate menace (here by reptiles and pirates and weather and whatnot). Similarly, the Story sucks in the routine post-apocalypse, consisting of the protagonist\u2019s insignificant struggles against the purposeless menace of the sucky Setting. World is taken over by atavistic \u201cintruders from the Triassic past\u201d (21), which probably doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of scientific sense. The atavistic life forms are apparently in some sort of Freudian or Marxist relation with the geologically appropriate ones, insofar as \u201cthe reptiles had gone down before the emergent mammals\u201d and have an \u201cimplacable hatred one zoological class feels towards another that usurps it\u201d (30). (Don\u2019t look at me; I\u2019m scratching my head, too.)Psychologist in the narrative develops the theory that, consistent with the \u201csame avalanche backwards into the past\u201d (54), survivors will \u201cdescend back into the neuronic past\u201d (56), which strikes me as some kind of evopsych tomfoolery, the mind adopting antediluvian mannerisms to become \u201ca traveller in a Wellsian time machine\u201d (57). Survivors are accordingly afflicted by \u201cancient organic memory millions of years old\u201d (89). Anyway, protagonist buggers off to be a troglodyte in accordance with Darwinian-hobbesian imperatives. Or something.Recommended for persons thrown up out of Earth\u2019s magma by some vast natural cataclysm, embalmed in the gigantic intervals of time that had elapsed during their subsidence, inverted Crusoes who deliberately maroon themselves, and corpses floating out in their unraveling winding sheets in a grim rehearsal of the Day of Judgment."}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "I liked the basic premise of The Drowned World: in 2145, a tiny handful of hardy souls is moored in a superheated, drowned city (which turns out to be London), surrounded by deep lagoons - they have to live near the tops of buildings because everything below is flooded, silt-covered, and seaweed-smeared - just finishing up some science things before returning to the Arctic Circle where the temperature is a more comfortable 85\u00b0. I liked most of the thick description. Nice nouns and adjectives, mostly. (The overheating and flooding was caused not by burning fossil fuels, but by a series of violent and prolonged solar storms which began to melt the ice caps.)But there was too much silliness: people are still playing records on record-players and typing on typewriters; black people are still Negroes; Beatrice Dahl spends much of the novel in a full length brocade gown (did Ballard understand what brocade is? It's thick and heavy, curtain material, and no sane person would be wearing brocade with a temperature over 95\u00b0). It was unclear how the protagonists had a constant supply of fresh water, and how other things like alcohol, suntan oil, and women's makeup never seemed to run out. Some of the characters remain sane and understand that they cannot live in a superheated London for long, but other characters are summoned by deep \"neuronic\" impulses encoded in their atavistic genes to revert to their Triassic era longings, when apparently all creatures pined for the sun. So the two or three crazy people flee superheated London and make their way south, via whatever boat-type apparatus they can cobble together, toward the Equator. At this point during daylight hours the temperature is in the range of 140\u00b0-150\u00b0, at which point life is not sustainable. Yet they sustain. (Where is their water coming from?)There was a whole long plotline where looters - basically a big bunch of Negroes led by a sinister white man who was able to command herds of giant alligators - infested the drowned city and harassed the others. I was not into this plotline at all.I might have generously given this 3 stars were it not for 3 appalling typos or grammatical errors; have these been in the text since 1962? One shudders. On p. 89 \"ours\" is spelled \"our's.\" On p. 129 (this is so painful) Ballard uses \"I\" when he should be using \"me.\" And on p. 167 we read about a \"yoke\" sac."}, {"userName": "Sesana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana", "userReview": "The sun has gone mad. The ice has melted, and the continual flooding has covered much of the world with water. Temperatures have risen to the point where humanity has relocated to the Arctic and Antarctic circles just to survive. The result is that cities like London have become lagoons, surrounded by jungles and with only the top floors of the tallest buildings above water.That's the setting of The Drowned World, and it's by far the best thing about the book. Ballard has quite a way with descriptions here, making his dystopian London vividly real. Yes, it is rather more extreme than most global warming scenarios would call for, but Ballard made it thoroughly believable. And yet it's still, by its very nature, a surreal landscape from a dream, or a nightmare.The plot and the characters, on the other hand... Not strengths here, no. The plot is rather thin, and deals mostly with the main character, and a few others, mentally regressing in the primordial atmosphere. I'm not sure I really bought into the whole concept, though that may well be a problem more with the fairly weak and shallow characters. Only the villain has had any serious work done in rounding him out, and he is certainly a memorable character. Everybody else, even the main character, are little more than cardboard cutouts. With bonus racism and sexism for good measure. The only female character is nothing more than a prop for the male characters to maneuver around, and there's an uncomfortable air of minstrelsy around the black characters. I could have done without, to say the least.I had to give some serious thought to my rating for this book. I give very high marks to the setting, world building, and descriptions.

Old cities are flooded and overrun with prehistoric reptiles and jungle and humans do visit these regions for reasons either due to science or profit. The story follows Dr. Robert Kerans and a few others who choose to remain in the city (London) after the rest of the humans have returned north due to rising temperatures, and in the description it mentions the effects of the surrounding environment on the human mind.This really should have been my type of book because I love all things philosophical and the mysteries of the human mind are still being explored today. Instead what I got was a boring, unexplained story on Kerans staying in the city and eventually making a trek south. What I mean when I say unexplained is that none of the characters actions or decisions were ever explained, they just did things without much thought or consideration making them impossible for me to connect with. That also brings me onto the fact that none of the characters were developed or had personalities\u2026 Now some might say that\u2019s okay for them but for me character development is a must for any good story no matter how short or long.About the only things I did like was the world building, setting and scientific descriptions, but even these were minuscule. The main theme in this book is de-evolution and genetic memories long dormant coming to life again. It should have been exciting, fascinating and rich but instead these elements were more or less pushed to one side while the story focused on Kerans\u2019 \u201cstruggles\u201d which were quite slow-paced and seemed to not have any meaning to them.The ending was a major WTF as I still find it hard to believe that a man with a high title would immediately want to leave everything he has known behind in search for a future where he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll even survive\u2026 Also another thing I don\u2019t like about the ending is that it was uncertain what became of Kerans as he wandered off with an infected leg wound and it looks like he would eventually die but who knows? And most of all who cares?? So this was a very disappointing read that I thought would be fascinating and fast but turned out to be anything but."}, {"userName": "Arybo \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50870096-arybo", "userReview": "Insomma.2.75Ottime premesse, esecuzione deludente.Stile di scrittura fiorito ma noioso, lunghi periodi difficili da seguire, descrizioni interessanti ma spesso prolisse.

There are a couple of radical shifts from the earlier book.I am a bit obsessed these days with climate fiction (it even has a genre abbreviation: CliFi) because despite ISIS, racial upheaval, the circus of the Presidential race, etc etc, we won't be able to be entertained by all this foolishness if we don't have a living planet on which to play out our human antics.While other books I am reading from 1962 are concerned with the Cold War, atomic weapons, the beginnings of the sexual revolution, and Civil Rights, there is also a growing awareness of the effects of industrial practices on the environment.The Drowned World is not exactly a screed about our endangered world as caused by mankind. It is apocalyptic in a different sense. In this short novel, solar flares and the accompanying radiation have resulted in polar ice-cap melt and soaring temperatures so the coastal cities of the world have become lagoons.Biologists Dr Kerans and Dr Bodkin are part of the crew of a biological testing station monitoring these changes. They are currently docked over a drowned London. Kerans lives in the penthouse suite of the Ritz Hotel because it is deserted and also above water. Dr Bodkin, his assistant, is going mad and feral, refusing to return north with the rest of the team and wanting to become one with a world returning to prehistoric times.The heat and the encroaching tropical jungle of sixty-foot-high ferns complete with sea creatures, all create a Jurrassic Park atmosphere. Kerans and Bodkin are both having surreal dreams filled with prehistoric images. Both decide to stay behind and embrace what seems to be a devolution to an earlier consciousness.There is more: a deranged pirate and his crew scavenging for the lost treasures of 20th century London and a beautiful former socialite named Beatrice. Of course, there must be a love interest! The whole story is creepy and psychological in the extreme. Kerans's attempt to return to \"the forgotten paradises of the reborn Sun\" almost gave me nightmares.Rather than a tale of how mankind might rebuild civilization after an apocalyptic event, Ballard this time presents an apocalypse of humanity descending the evolutionary ladder. I've not read anything like it."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6022914-james", "userReview": "Ballard's first 'official' novel, The Drowned World, still shows some signs of mastering his craft. Some odd characters and characterisations, and some odd pacing, take the edge off an otherwise excellent environmental dystopian future. It doesn't appear to be an anthropogenic disaster, but the icecaps have melted, the world has been flooded and burning sunlight is making life pretty hard for the survivors. The story revolves around a smallish cast of misfits, living around a lagoon above a flooded London. Dr. Robert Kerans is living in the penthouse of a hotel, Beatrice Dahl is living on the opposite side of the lagoon in an apartment and nearby is a military group conducting experiments before they all need to move north to escape the oncoming worsening of the weather conditions.Robert and Beatrice are carrying on an on-off affair and as a sort of dream-borne madness descends on the community the two of them decide to stay behind and face it out. Instead a group of pirates turn up and begin to loot the surviving buildings and terrorise the remaining survivors. As the dreams take hold of Robert and Beatrice they feel that they are devolving, mentally, losing their developed humanity as they develop a more lethargic mindset. This is balanced against an increased physical evolution in the local flora and fauna, with large plant species flourishing in the harsh environmental conditions.The science is a little basic in places: with all the increased solar radiation there doesn't seem to be any major outbreaks of skin cancer. They also seem to have a reasonably safe supply of fuel and booze considering how long the world must have been flooded. These minor quirks aside, and I suppose being written in 1962 there was a less developed understanding of the potential consequences of global warming, it's an interesting yarn exploring the decline of Robert's mental state as the dreams infect him and the decline of civilisation in the trail of a global environmental disaster."}, {"userName": "Lou Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6023958-lou-robinson", "userReview": "I was a tad disappointed with The Drowned World, having read a couple of other Ballad works. But I should cut the author some slack, this was his first book. And I did like it, just didn't love it. The overall basis of the story, set in a future (although not too far in the future) globally warmed, flooded London, is an interesting one. Again Ballad has that knack of describing a situation that is the right side of believable, this could happen, and that makes it a disturbing read. But the Drowned world is a slow starter, too much description in the first half of the book, it picks up and the second half is really where the action is. Good story, execution needs work, and Ballad certainly improves with subsequent novels. The Ritz will never seem the same again."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "Will review later."}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "This month's Post-apocalyptic Book Club selection.This was a re-read, though I'd read it so long ago it might as well have been in the Jurassic period.JG Ballard succeeds marvelously in creating a hallucinatory, dreamlike environment here. Solar flares have heated the Earth. Only 5 million people still live, mainly on military-style bases in the Antarctic. Our protagonist, Kerans, is a biologist assigned to a team with the singularly pointless task of venturing south and mapping the changed earth, with its lagoons caused by polar melt and bizarre new plants... the formerly temperate zones are changing back to prehistoric-style jungle.However, in this hot and humid atmosphere, people seem to be going crazy, afflicted by shared dreams from the primeval unconscious, losing the drive to live. In half-submerged London, Kerans, his older colleague Bodkin, and the woman Beatrice, decide to stay, rather than return to the Antarctic. It's a decision that clearly will not lead to their continued survival; ambiguously suicidal.However, the trio's doomed idyll is thrown into upheaval by the arrival of Strangman, a bizarre albino riverboat captain with a crew of caricatured and allegorical savages.Strangman seeks to drain the lagoon, and becomes more and more of a threatening figure. Although lethargic and passive, the trio oppose his wishes, feeling inexorably drawn to accept the course of nature, and embrace its terrible beauty, even though nature has become inimical to human life.Ballard sure does love 'Heart of Darkness.' This is a deeply symbolic work, and draws a lot from Conrad's. However, many of the themes touched on here are dealt with more deftly in Ballard's later books. The characters here are very flat, especially for a psychological novel. Yes, Ballard is using the trope of the 'savage' for literary purpose, but I'm not at all sure that excuses his portrayal of the crewmen as nearly inhuman beings.Flaws and all, I'd still say this book is worth reading. There's a lot packed into its brief pages; it made for a really good book group discussion. I also simply enjoyed its evocative, lush and oppressive atmosphere."}], "description": "In the 21st century, fluctuations in solar radiation have caused the ice-caps to melt and the seas to rise. Global temperatures have climbed, and civilization has retreated to the Arctic and Antarctic circles. London is a city now inundated by a primeval swamp, to which an expedition travels to record the flora and fauna of this new Triassic Age. This early novel by the author of CRASH and EMPIRE OF THE SUN is at once a fast paced narrative, a stunning evocation of a flooded, tropical London of the near future and a speculative foray into the workings of the unconscious mind.", "title": "The Drowned World", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262356.The_Drowned_World", "average": 3.55, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1434118227l/262356.jpg", "reviews": 704, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7010931.J_G_Ballard", "name": "J.G.
