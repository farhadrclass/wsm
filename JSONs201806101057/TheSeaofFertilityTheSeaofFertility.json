I tried to contact someone there to find and reserve it for me but in vain. Thus, I finally saw this paperback wait for me on its shelf on May 5, 2010 when I went there again. I'm sorry I don't know Japanese, therefore, I have to be content with its translated version in English. Indeed, I recall vaguely when I sometime visited my favorite Asia Books bookstore on Sukhumvit Road in Bangkok during my college years in the late 60's, I saw this novel on display but I couldn't remember picking it up to browse a few pages because I didn't know Yukio Mishima or have any motive to read it, it's simply beyond my reading capacity then.Surprisingly, he wrote some parts based on Thailand's background and some interesting Thai characters. I presume he might have visited Thailand till he felt familiar with our culture. It's simply astonishing for such a brilliant Japanese writer.On May 15, 2010, I was reading Chapter 52 (10 pages to go); I hoped to finish reading his \"Spring Snow\" (Book I), so that I gained familiarity regarding his writing style and ways of looking at things. All I can say now is that his style is unique and brilliant compared with other Japanese authors since I've never read him before.On June 4, 2010 I finished reading \"Runaway Horses\" (Book II). I found its 40 Chapters still enjoyable since the key characters have been interestingly enmeshed in the rightist movement, radicalism and patriotism.After putting this book aside for a year, on May 5, 2011 I finished reading \"The Temple of Dawn\" (Book III). Honda, it seems to me, is the hero whose fate has dictated himself to meet Ying Chan (Kiyoaki, his friend, believed to be reborn) in Thailand and later in Japan till her passing at 20.Therefore, \"The Decay of the Angel\" (Book IV) would be the last one for me to read as soon as I can find motivation. On May 21, 2011, I finished reading this tetralogy and found Book IV a three-star one (like Book III) while Books I & II, I think, should deserve their 4-star ratings. Therefore, the rating above should be 3.5, not 4.In brief, this novel is surprisingly, enjoyably readable if you have time and don't mind trying reading Yukio Mishima and thus you'd know why he has long been regarded as one of the great Japanese authors; I myself couldn't help being grief-stricken when he passed away so soon (like the daffodils in a Wordsworth's poem I read in an English literature course)."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145023-kay", "userReview": "Yukio Mishima is not an easy read at any time. In the four books that make up the collection, or pehaps series, (mishima didn't seem to like the idea that these were a chronological series, from what I've managed to read of the critical commentary at the time, he seems to think of them as something like facets) he explores issues that are not easy either. He was advocate of the Imperial Japan that had carried out atrocities; a student of sado-masochism; a modernist in dress but a traditionalist in aesthetics - a complex and clearly tormented man, who lays out aspects of himself like dissected specimens in the stories he tells, but who also confronts what we now call political correctness, with a combination of head-on aggression and strange, painful, sardonic commentary.There is an involuted beauty in his work, a form of nostalgia for what is past, combined with a barely-restrained fury at the losses that modern day Japan will choose to accept, to gain rewards that he finds risible. Perhaps the most difficult part of the tetralogy to understand is the way that the main character (but anti-hero) Honda, experiences what he believes to be the fourfold reincarnation of his schoolfriend Matsugae - and the way he fails in each book to 'save' his dearest friend from early death. Mishima did not believe in reincarnation, and it may be that this is an allegorical exploration of the 'deaths' of Japan.The texts as a whole are definitely pessimistic in outlook, regressive in nature and elegaic for a Japan he knows can never be rebuilt; they are violent and sadistic and painful and bleak. And yet, despite all that negativity, the beauty of his descriptions and the way he explores issues of loyalty and sacrifice are quite superb."}, {"userName": "Heba Al-salti", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17840692-heba-al-salti", "userReview": "\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0635\u0628 . \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0623\u062f\u0628\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 ..\u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0627\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0623\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0634\u0631\u062d \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0630\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0646\u062a\u0648 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0645\u0644 .. \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0638\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0636\u064a\u0627\u0639 \u0644\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u062c\u0647\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0642\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 .. \u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0628\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645\u0647\u0627 .. \u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 (\u062b\u0644\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639)..\u0647"}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/138493-kristen", "userReview": "My love affair with Japanese literature knows no bounds.

It is a great work that deserves to be considered amongst the greatest literary achievements of the 20th century, and like Proust it explores in depth the different phases of a man's life along with his obsessions, eccentricities, and eventual decay. Like Proust it doesn't shy away from the scandalous, but instead illuminates it as evidence of human frailty. The final book \"Decay of an Angel\" was a big influence on my novel The Frozen Ocean as the main character Toru, a detached and troubled youth who sometimes imagines he is \"an atomic bomb\", was a model for some aspects of the main character in my novel. What amazes me about Mishima is that you hear so many stories about his life that make you think he was a fanatic or eccentric, but in his writing he has such penetrating insight into all types of characters from banks and businessmen to young schoolboys, gay monarchs and drug addicts, that he can sum up a person in just a sentence or two. Even as I describe it I am getting the urge to pick it up again! And isn't that the very essence of a great novel?"}, {"userName": "Mike Mcconnell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18943984-mike-mcconnell", "userReview": "Having previously read Mishima's THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA I was keen to read this book, commonly considered his opus. Telling a story over sixty years and eight hundred pages is a delicate thing and Mishima does it well. Dealing with themes of reincarnation, perception, political upheaval and the human condition it was a powerful story told by a masterful storyteller. While at times it became a bit SOPHIE'S WORLD with passages on Buddhist philosophy and theories of reincarnation these were often framed in a way that elucidated the main character's thoughts and feelings at different points in his life. Also the word vermilion pops up a bit to often but that may be down to the translator rather than the author."}, {"userName": "George Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21213233-george-thomas", "userReview": "I read each of the four books in the series, which enthralled me by the concept of the reincarnation of a character in a previous book reappearing in a different form in the following book.

The book is divided into four parts, most people prefer either Spring Snow or Runaway Horses, probably because they get stuck in part 3, The Temple of Dawn, where Mishima kind of drones on a bit about Buddhist theology, and as a result never read part 4, The Decay of the Angel, which is one of the best things I've ever read. The Buddhist exposition didn't bother me so much, but if it does bother you just bear with it because, man alive, the last part is good.He finished his just before his theatrical suicide, and if you've ever wondered what a person feels before doing such a thing, this book will tell you."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10023481-peter", "userReview": "I read this more than thirty years ago, but the opening scene, as the main character is looking out at the sea from somewhere on the Izu Peninsula is still with me. It is interesting that this, his last novel, takes him back to the place where he started, staring out across the sea at the island of Oshima, where his first hit, The Sound of the Waves, was set. And of course, who can forget the role of the sea in A Death in Midsummer.
