This was a heartbreaking WWII story revolving around Emmanuelle \u201cEmma\u201d, a young baker who is forced to supply daily loaves of bread to the Nazi officers occupying her small French village.While I enjoyed this novel, I felt that there was nothing that made it stand out from the several other WWII novels that I have read. There seems to be an influx of WWII novels being written over the last while and it takes an extremely strong storyline along with exceptional writing to stand out from the crowd.I liked Emma\u2019s character, but she had such a harsh and bitter side to her personality she often came across very rough and tough. I understand that this was the intention and that her roughness was an effect of the world she was living in, but she just wasn\u2019t a highly likeable character for me. I admire and appreciate what she did but couldn\u2019t quite fully connect with her.I don\u2019t think I will ever tire of reading wartime novels. I am drawn to them and always seem to find myself fascinated with what people endured and the strength they were able to find during these devastating times. I enjoyed this book, but wouldn\u2019t consider it outstanding in its category."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "IT IS June, 1944 and this small village in Normandy is under the occupation of German forces. Many have been shot or taken prisoner, but many are left alive, their services integral for the German forces.one such person is 22 year old Emma, once the Baker's assistant, she is now responsible for baking the baguettes a high ranking German officer finds he cannot do without. Emma no longer believes in her faith, nor does she have any belief that the allied forces will come to the rescue. With that in mind, she sets out to do her best to ensure the survival of those left in the village, many who are slowly starving to death. Although this subject has been replayed many times in novels, the characters set this one apart. The characters are varied, from different occupations. from the resistance, to farmers, fishermen, and one young woman finds her own, frowned upon way, to survive. Emma who knows the town's pathways and short cuts better than most, finds ways to get things to those most in need. She is spunky, clever, and formidable, though this will put her in harms way. When the invasion of Normandy finally does come, the scenes are horrific, as history dictates. A finely written novel, with some unique characters that captured my interest early on. It is often the people that risk much, that save many. The Germans are stereotypically portrayed with a few exceptions. This is a read I took to heart.ARC from publisher."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "THE BAKER\u2019S SECRET takes us to a small village in Normandy during WWII. We follow Emma, her family, and the village as they live under the restraints of German occupation. The village citizens work together to stay alive and to help each other.Emma is a very strong female character that you can't help but sympathize with and fall in love with. She is someone you would love to have had in your village during WWII.Emma's strength and subtle resistance to the Germans was amazing. Emma knew how to be subversive and still stay alive.Emma's role in helping to save the residents of her town was to follow the Kommandant's order to bake bread for him and his men every day. Emma had a secret about baking this bread. She would sneak in two extra loaves to share with the townspeople by stretching the number of required loaves by two.THE BAKER'S SECRET shows the unity the Europeans had to have in order to survive.The characters were authentic, and you will become immersed in their lives and suffer with them as well as silently cheer with them when the courage they share turns in to a triumph.I thoroughly enjoyed THE BAKER'S SECRET. The writing is marvelous and detailed. The book is one you won't want to put down. If you read only one book this year, make it THE BAKER'S SECRET. THE BAKER'S SECRET is a wonderful testimony and tribute to the people who lived through and survived WWII. 5/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45632570-tim", "userReview": "I\u2019m always a bit suspicious of novels that on the one hand deal with a historic event but on the other invent a location to set the story in. You sometimes feel this is an easy way of both bypassing research and taking poetic licence to an excessive extreme. For example I\u2019m not sure All the Light We Cannot See would have been quite so bewitching had it been set not in Mont Saint-Michel but instead in a made up town. The backdrop of Mont Saint-Michel gave Doerr\u2019s book a solid foundation against which he could weave all his magic. The Baker\u2019s Secret is set in a fictitious town in northern France. Its central character is Emma, the town baker. She is given the task of baking bread for local German officers. Except instead of baking the required dozen loaves she adds sawdust to the flour and bakes fourteen. It\u2019s a nice idea and probably very accurate regarding how tiny most people\u2019s contribution to the resistance was. However, this is a strange floating novel with no real central plot line. We\u2019re introduced to a variety of the town\u2019s residents, all of whom are whimsical rather than recognisably true to life. This creates the atmosphere of a fable, as does the chatty voice of the narrative, but this novel never engaged me emotionally. It was a bit like a cartoon version of life in France during WW2."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/896357-kevin", "userReview": "Emma has learned how to bake bread, pastries, cakes and the most beautiful creations trained by her critical mentor, Ezra. Ezra has been the village baker since before she was born. She is forced to watch him wear the six-pointed star of David by the German occupiers of her coastal Normandy village. The Nazi kommandant notices the bakery and commands Emma to bring him 12 loaves of bread every day. His men bring her the flour and other ingredients used to make the bread. In order to help feed as many of her neighbors as possible, Emma adds ground up hay to the bread mixture to make 14 loaves instead of 12. This is Emma's first act of defiance to the occupiers but certainly not her last. An excellent story that brings the occupation of France and the D-day invasion to life. This book reminded me in part of \"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society\" and the darker \"Skeletons at the Feast.\" I really enjoyed this one!"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "Here was the war's strangest lesson yet. All sorts of people -friends and family, yes,but also adversaries and annoyances - all kinds had died. As they left behind everything, work and home and habits and opinions and even hidden chickens, somehow Emma's heart broke for all of them, including the ones she couldn't bear. Somehow their dying made them unhateable. Well, this was truly not a typical WWII fiction and by that I mean, our protagonist Emmanuelle (Emma) is not the typical type of heroine that our authors or our Hollywood script writers usually tote out for our entertainment. Emma isn't clasping her hands over her breasts and looking all doe eyed and saying things like \"Oh those nasty German soldiers are sure going to get it when the Allies, especially the fearsome Americans come and defeat them.\" She isn't joining the Resistance, smuggling Jewish people or helping Allied pilots get back to Britain. Nope, Emma has seen too much death-watched the occupiers take away her father and lover and been witnessed to horrific acts. Emma scoffs at hope,of talk of her priest's God, and feels anger that the Allies are doing absolutely nothing while the people of the Norman coast are made to suffer under a forced occupation. Realistically, it would be hard to love Emma, but I did. Let me tell you that Stephen P. Kiernan did his homework. Although he doesn't state much, only alluding to a visit to Normandy, I suspect that he probably heard many of the stories I did when I visited that particular area in the summer of 2013. If you look closely at the five beaches-Gold, ,Arrow, Juno, Omaha Utah, at all the war memorials and\"welcome to our liberator signs\" and actually take the time to listen to the stories of the local people, you will come away with one particular point the people of Normandy suffered under their occupiers. Although this story takes place in a fictional village,  The Baker's Secret matches very much the tone of Suite Francaise, a book that really seemed to be a character sketch of how people in a time of war really do act. Emma may have been as crusty as her bread, but she did what she could to survive and her victories often were little things like smuggling food to feed villagers or stealing fuel from the tank of a German officer. Her actions weren't for some big cause, just that she was a French woman that lived in a village and she wanted the war to end. That alone might make her one of my memorable characters of the year."}, {"userName": "Gemma", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67746782-gemma", "userReview": "The Baker\u2019s Secret is about the experiences of a Normandy village under the Nazis. It aspires to be a kind of fable and its whimsical chatty tone (not quite of the \u201cdear reader\u201d variety but not far off) irritated me until I got used to it. I was suspicious that the author was trying to cash in on the success of The Book Thief and All the Light We cannot See \u2013 world war two as adult fairy story. All the characters are both larger and smaller than life \u2013 ordinary people who have been given an exaggerated defining trait, often of a comic nature. There\u2019s a mad boy who climbs trees, a wastrel who sleeps with pigs, a priest who appears sympathetic to the Nazis. An odd thing about this novel is there aren\u2019t any resolutions to the few mysteries it poses. At the end of the day there\u2019s little at stake save the safety of the characters. No subplots of note. Eventually I did begin to enjoy the story but I\u2019m not sure about this new trend of moondusting what the Nazis did. There were one or two moments when the feelgood fairy story tone of this jarred.

KiernanImagine living 5 Km/3 miles from the Normandy Beaches that will, unbeknownst to you, be the location for the Allied invasion, and the beginning of the end to WWII. In a small French village named Vergers, it is spring, 1944, and the occupying German army is wreaking havoc on the locals. You have seen your neighbor\u2019s husband executed in cold blood and then several soldiers grab the new widow, take her into a barn and rape her repeatedly. Yet every day you get up before daylight and prepare bread for the senior officers\u2019 mess. Emma, the baker, short for Emmanuell, takes the flour ration provided by the Germans to bake the bread, and, by adding a little ground up straw can make 2 additional loaves to give to starving friends. There is hope. The French have heard rumors of the Allied invasion that will rid the locals of the daily nightmare they endure. They believe it is coming but don\u2019t know when. While they wait, the underground resistance provides whatever assistance they can give the Allies. The Normandy location for the story is what attracted me to the book. Having visited the DDay Beaches several years ago, and knowing the area the author described, made the excellent story much more meaningful.

The people in the town don't have any real idea of what is going on in the big picture of the war, they mainly know how it is affecting them to have German troops occupying their town and ruling their lives.The novel takes place in the village of Vergers, a small village in France about a mile from the ocean and centers around the town baker, Emma. Emma had been ordered by the German command to bake 12 loaves of bread for them every day and was given enough flour to bake just 12 loaves. Instead she mixed ground up straw with her dough so that she had enough dough to make 14 loaves and could share 2 loaves with the people in town who were the hungriest. Even though her mentor had been killed by the Germans, her father had been sent away on a train and her boyfriend had been sent to join the German army, Emma still felt that it was her duty to help the people in her town as best she could. Emma is courageous and puts her life on the line to help the people in her town. She doesn't think of herself as heroic but feels that she is doing what needs to be done to help people get through each day.The author does a fantastic job of depicting the realities of war on the people who are not part of the fighting but are the collateral damage of the war. He gives an honest portrayal of the indignities that the Germans forced onto the citizens and depicts the lives of the people who are starving and desperate in detail.

Sometimes the most unqualified souls become merciful yet tenacious, humble heroes. This is the story of one such young lady: a baker's apprentice; who, like bread, rises in the heat of oppression, transforming inwardly and outwardly, quietly sustaining the lives of those who partake in her offerings. Emma is an enigma of sorts: an introvert with extrovert tendencies. She's a dedicated daughter, but not very subservient. She's bullheaded and mouthy at times, but kindhearted and self-regulating pliable. Often judgmental. Always observant. She sees the needs of her war-oppressed neighbors, and tries her best to fill each one, whether or not she holds them in high regard or not. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. He who is most guilty, usually casts the first stone. \"In war time beauty is a weakness. Be it by one soldier or many, sooner or later an attractive girl of twenty-two will be ground like straw.\"War changes everything.

The Baker\u2019s Secret ranks at the top of my list of books about this era along with Jillian Cantor\u2019s The Lost Letter (out in June 2017). Stephen Kiernan\u2019s writing is beautiful and magical, and his characters are authentic and brave beyond words. The story takes place in Vergers, a French town on the Normandy coast on the eve of D-Day. The town is occupied by the Nazis who have beaten down the townspeople with countless acts of cruelty including rationing food to the point that everyone is slowly starving. Even after digesting countless novels about Europe during World War 2, I am still stunned and angered by the intentional and horrific cruelty the Nazis inflicted on anyone who crossed their paths, including the people living in the various places they occupied. The opening portion of this book focuses on several such incidents which made me worry the entire book would be very depressing. However, as the story progresses, Kiernan tells the wonderful tale of the courageous baker Emmanuelle and her fellow villagers who worked to defy the Nazis in their own subtle ways. The Baker\u2019s Secret is still a tear jerker (have plenty of tissues handy!), but the book\u2019s message is one of optimism and the ability of humans to overcome even the most tragic circumstances. The ending of the book is phenomenal. I cannot say much more without spoiling the story, but once you hit the last 80 or so pages be prepared to do nothing else but read until you finish this wonderful book. I highly, highly recommend The Baker\u2019s Secret. It is truly a must-read.

Til the Germans took over, it was almost an idylic existance. Because Ezra was Jewish, he was eventually killed by the Nazis. Thus, Emma becomes the main baker and catches the Germans attention. She is ordered to bake twelve loaves of bread for the Nazi officers stationed in her French village every morning. She manages to make fourteen by mixing ground hay with the flour and distributes the two extra loaves to her village. Soon, she is managing a secret network and exchanging different goods. These acts of resistance help not just the villagers, its what sustains her.I read a lot of historical fiction, particularly pertaining to this time period and this work did not stand out for me. There are numerous novels whose backgrounds are WWII and Nazi occupation and it is possible to write one that differs from the lot. This novel did not do that. The cover is lovely, the idea is great, the prose is nicely written but the execution is lacking. Emma is the central character. She is daring and stubborn but always finds a way to help out her village. While she might not come off as the most sympathetic person that is understandable given her current situation. The remaining characters appear to be chosen at random, they are not memorable nor do they add to the narrative. The plot does not really go anywhere, its stagnant. This work failed to keep me engaged throughout the length of the novel. The setting and time period were aptly chosen but that is not enough to make a compelling story.

Each desire inspires a new idea on how to undermine the Nazis to obtain it. Each little triumph keeps the spark of hope glowing in the people of the town. Even for those Emma dislikes or who dislike her, they are bound together in their shared wish to see the destruction of the oppressors.THE BAKER\u2019S SECRET beautifully demonstrates the power of small acts done with great care, and the ripples that expand outward from those acts. In spite of how hardened Emma has become, she is a protagonist with whom the reader forges a strong alliance. Her sorrows are ours. Her pain is ours. Her joy, ours.Kiernan is a writer of enormous talent, and this novel is a triumph. The reader knows D-Day is coming, and can hardly wait for Emma to find out.

In my opinion there are SO many great WWII historical fiction books out there and this one didn't stand out to me. I really loved the setting, the small village on the Normandy coast just before the D-Day invasion. The villagers were just beaten down, barely trying to survive, and some of them had hope that the Allies would rescue them and some thought it would never happen. I liked that part of it, knowing the doubters would be proven wrong. Reading about the invasion was, of course, awe inspiring. I still am struck dumb when I think about it.

Kiernan didn't mince the atrocities of war to both humans and animals.

Kiernan shines a spotlight on the resilience of humanity amid the brutality of war. At times it\u2019s tempting to look away, to ignore the rawness of survival, to pause the bleak hopelessness that clouds Emma\u2019s life. It\u2019s painful to see the abuses of the church\u2019s Monsignor \u2013 a man who should, by his very job description, be the source of hope and integrity in the occupied village. The honesty is graphic in places, discreet in others, and in every aspect of the story humanity\u2019s fierce will to survive is both inspiring and sobering.I loved reading about Emma\u2019s craftiness in figuring out how best to help the starving and otherwise needy villagers (thanks to the Nazi occupation) all while avoiding detection. She vehemently denies being part of the Resistance, yet it\u2019s her work that enables the local Resistance movement to thrive. While harsh and bitter loss follows her, Emma\u2019s strong will remains resilient. Her grandmother is my favorite character in the book and I often wanted to stop reading just to hug her.The writing is beautiful, almost poetic, with haunting lines such as: \u201cThe guttural ruled the elegant, the command replaced persuasion, the shout overwhelmed the subtle.\u201dAnd this description of what the Allied invasion meant to the people of France, especially to Emma: \u201cThe weight of their sacrifice might crush her. Here they had died, and up the beach they were still dying, in flocks and willingly for the idea that she, Emma herself, and her friends and family and neighbors, ought to live in freedom. Who on earth deserved such a gift?\u201dBottom Line: The Baker\u2019s Secret by Stephen P. Kiernan is exquisite in its prose and authentic in its execution. Its reality is painful, yes, but inspiring at the same time, and readers will gain a deeper understanding of both the occupation of France and the importance of D-Day and the subsequent Allied sacrifices.

Her town would be idyllic if it weren't for the Nazis that have occupied the town and turned everything upside down. The villagers often feel like they don't have a lot of recourse or ways to show their displeasure. Emma does it in small ways as she and the rest of the villagers are waiting for the allies to come.Emma is a fantastic character. Even though her messing with the bread that she is to provide to the Nazis could get her in a lot of trouble, she doesn't seem to worry about it much at all. She knows that providing comfort to others in her village is worth the trouble. She is so calm and steady throughout the book and I really loved reading about her very subtle protest and fearlessness throughout the book. I liked a lot of the secondary characters as well. Emma's grandmother, Meme, is another good character who was very memorable for me.The writing of the book felt a little stiff to me. While I liked Emma and the secondary characters, I had this sense of feeling as if I was being held at arms' length to really getting to know the characters. In a way, the stiffness works because it evokes the way that Emma seems to hold most everyone at arms' length. She is most definitely all business!The setting of the book was great! I really liked the detail in the setting though. I can't recall reading any historical fiction set in Normandy before the allies landed so it was really great to see it in this book!

Keirnan since reading his debut novel The Curiosity, back in 2013. His sophomore novel The Hummingbird, showed his flexibility as an author and cemented his place as one of my \"must reads.\" I was eager to get my hands on a copy of his latest work, The Baker's Secret, and I gladly jumped at the opportunity to read the advanced copy that his publisher provided. True to form, Kiernan managed to present another poignant and moving story that had me reading into all hours of the night.The year is 1944 and Nazi Germany has invaded Normandy. Emmanuelle, Emma to everyone in her village, has been the apprentice to the town's baker for several years now. Her natural dexterity in the kitchen saw her become the baker's right-hand-man and even begin to surpass his expertise. The German occupation has not been kind to Emma. Her mentor was senselessly murdered in the town square by the Nazi's, and her father was imprisoned. Now Emma is left to run the bakery and care for her grandmother. Emma's reputation as a master baker eventually gains the attention of the occupying army. They provide her with a meager supply of rations in exchange for daily loaves of freshly baked bread. Like clockwork, Emma's days become a ritual of servitude to the people who have destroyed her home. Amongst this dreary existence, a ray of hope begins to shine in the form of quiet resistance. Emma begins to supplement her flour with ground up wheat, allowing her to produce two extra loaves to feed her town. This subtle act of defiance ignites hope in the village. They begin to beleive that one day the allies will relieve them of this horrific occupation. But how long can Emma keep this up? If even one soldier suspects her of trickery, the entire town could pay the price. Can she maintain this opposition long enough for the justice to win out?The Baker's Secret sees Stephen P. Kiernan write his most mature and emotionally satisfying novel to date. Unlike his previous works that shifted perspectives and time periods, this novel follows a straightforward narrative that allows for the nuanced development of the main character. The subject, specifically WWII, has been explored in countless other works of literature, but Kiernan brings a new angle to this tried and true genre. His background as a journalist allows him to effortlessly weave historical facts into his captivating fiction. Emma is a character who is wrought with a wonderfully intriguing duality. On the one hand, her will to resist the Nazis and provide for her town makes her into a figure of hope in their eyes. At the same time, she faces heavy doubt that her village will ever be free again. This conflict of emotion drives the development of her character and highlights what must have been a common thought process to those facing the reign of the Nazi army. It is human nature to resist oppression, even if that resistance is logically futile. Kiernan reinforces this internal strife with the physical suspense of the actual war. This combination makes for a page-turning read that is equal parts war thriller and character study. The quiet confidence of Kiernan's writing makes for an exceptional read that captured both my imagination and emotions. With the addition of The Baker's Secret to his already stellar bibliography, Stephen P. Kiernan has proved that he is a master storyteller who balances emotional complexity and engaging narrative with ease."}, {"userName": "Theresa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26823570-theresa", "userReview": "Where do I begin on the book that just absolutely swept me off my feet into a little village called Vergers? I can't remember the last time a book made me cry, in sadness at so many parts and in joy at others. This book was just absolutely amazing.We all learned about D-Day in school or saw it in the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan (arguably the best movie scene, in my opinion). This book captures that event and all of the strife this village faced leading up to it. It is an intense read, so much so I had to keep putting the book down to remember how breathing works. But for a book that starts off as dark and depressing, it has a really uplifting ending.Emma was a baker in the village of Vergers before the occupying army came to take over. With German forces taking all the food, shipping off the men to factories in Germany, and leaving the villagers with nothing to spare, Emma finds a way to keep her neighbors and friends from wanting. After tasting her bread on their arrival, the commander of the occupying army has rationed her just enough flour to make twelve loaves a day for him and his army. After finding a way to make this ration stretch into an extra two loaves, she feeds those who have nothing. She then finds herself among a black market of trade between fuel, tobacco, eggs, and even a lightbulb.The book calls into question everything we know living free with no restrictions on what we can buy and how much. How quickly we forget to turn the lamp off, knowing we can replace the lightbulb after a quick run to target? How often do we horribly screw up the cake we tried to make and run to the grocery for another dozen eggs? Well, what happens when you don't have that luxury? It reminds of that Seinfeld episode, \"you can't spare a square?\" The villagers literally didn't have a square to spare of anything. Keeping that in mind, our heroine Emma always seemed to find a way to get the job done just by making a few extra loaves of bread.The death toll in this book is high, and Kiernan doesn't leave much of the details to the imagination. What I'm saying is this book is not for the feint of heart. Tread lightly, because it is a little gruesome, but it's because of this that the book makes you feel so much. Everything these villagers experience, you will feel it. You're going to be angry, you're going to be sad, and you're going to be extremely happy you picked this book up.I won this book through a Goodreads giveaway. If I hadn't, I can't imagine how long this might have stayed on my TBR list. I'm so happy I won this and was able to read it so soon. It truly is a book everyone should read."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2056419-kate", "userReview": "Thanks to Goodreads, First Reads for my ARC of The Baker's Secret. Stephen P. Kiernan sets his story in a small French village in the Spring of 1944. The villagers have been occupied by the Nazis and are enduring almost indescribable hardships and horrors. Emmanuelle, the baker, bakes every morning for the Kommandant, and she spends the rest of the day giving her village hope for the future, while she herself is on the cusp of despair. Beautifully written, I kept turning the pages to see how these characters coped and survived the unimaginable.

I liked the MC and how she not only took care of her grandmother, but also many of the villagers. She was very creative. The baker's secret was also a nice angle in the story and there were other unique elements in the story line. Even with all of the above, this book was still only 3 stars. It felt glossy even though some tragic things did happen in this story. I think it was probably the writing because there seemed to be a fair amount of telling, instead of showing. Some of the events felt like it should have had a greater impact, but instead it was just kind of glossed over. I was wanting more....more detail....more emotion....just more."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4247182-elizabeth", "userReview": "This is an amazing and heartfelt story of a small town in France occupied by German forces during WWII.

Unlike the rest of her fellow villagers, Emma holds out no hope of the Allies' arrival. She fears the occupying army will always rule and that their current life is the new normal. In spite of this, and in spite of her staunch refusal to join the official resistance, Emma has become a one man underground trading market. It begins when the Kommandant tastes her baguette and insists she receive enough rations to bake a dozen of the loaves each day for him and his men. Emma complies, but pads the dough with ground straw in order to bake two extra she can divvy out amongst the starving villagers. Soon she's sourcing tobacco and fuel so that the villagers can have fish and other necessities. But with the ever present Germans oh, so watchful, Emma knows it's only a matter of time before she gets caught. Readers, this was a book I'd been greatly looking forward to. And I have to say Kiernan delivered wholeheartedly! My only regret is that I read this in the midst of having come down with a vicious cold and I fear that when I'm better, I'll come to the blog and see that this whole post is a bunch of gobbledygook!So I will attempt a readable review, but I promise nothing.The Baker's Secret is set in WWII occupied France, in a village that refuses to go down without making the Germans at least a little miserable for having taken their town. There is an arm of the official resistance, but everyone fights in their own little ways. One of the most prominent small battles: simply being late for all but collecting rations. And so, they've convinced the Germans that they're basically a village of buffoons earning latitude by being underestimated. Their resourcefulness is necessary for survival, because it's true none of them can see the end in sight.But everyone holds out hope that the allies will arrive and provide salvation.Except for Emma. Which is why she takes matters into her own hands, in spite of not wanting to get involved. See, there's a fire burning in Emma. A fire stoked by the murder of her uncle - the man she apprenticed with -, the conscription of her fianc\u00e9, and her father's arrest. That fire forces her to test the boundaries with her bread - how much straw can she add before the Germans will notice? It also forces her to test the boundaries with her boarders, carrying out her plans while a wormy and ruthless captain of the enemy army holds court in her own home. And it forces her to put aside any fear of her own safety, excepting how her capture or death would affect those who have come to rely on her.I loved Emma and all of the characters that people her village! Kiernan does a fantastic job bringing this small town and their small (and increasingly larger) acts of rebellion to life."}, {"userName": "Antonia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia", "userReview": "I enjoyed this novel about how one woman persevered and resisted the Nazi occupation of northern France in her own way. The characters were varied and interesting, but none as vividly portrayed as Emma, the central character. I particularly appreciated her (realistic) loss of faith in both God and the Allies as more died and the future looked increasingly bleak and hopeless. The tone sometimes seems at odds with the serious subject matter and I found it a little off at times. But I liked the story and, once halfway through, could not stop reading. If I were to take a lesson from this book, it\u2019s that in difficult and brutal times, our greatest hope lies in individual citizens, in continuing to treat one another with dignity and caring. Kiernan is a passionate writer and a compassionate human being."}], "description": "From the critically acclaimed author of The Hummingbird and The Curiosity comes a dazzling novel of World War II\u2014a shimmering tale of courage, determination, optimism, and the resilience of the human spirit, set in a small Normandy village on the eve of D-DayOn June 5, 1944, as dawn rises over a small town on the Normandy coast of France, Emmanuelle is making the bread that has sustained her fellow villagers in the dark days since the Germans invaded her country.
