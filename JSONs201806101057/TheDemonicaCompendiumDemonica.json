However, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone when I admit to reading this purely for the short story, The Reckoning.Whilst The Reckoning is only a few pages long, it gives us an insight into the past. Throughout the first three books we received bits and pieces about how the three brothers came together, of the time Wraith was saved from the vampires, and this story finally gives us the insight into the actual events. It\u2019s short, but it finally gives us all we wanted. Certainly worth reading if you\u2019re a fan of the wonderful trio and their brotherly bond."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3004972-mel", "userReview": "The Demonica Compendium is everything you needed and/or wanted to know about the demons within the Demonica/Lords of Deliverance world. You get characteristics of each different type of demon as well as how they rank on the Ufelskala (evil) scale. The world building is very detailed and there are numerous different demons, making the Demonica/Lords of Deliverance world rather complicated. Complicated world building made The Demonica Compendium a necessity.You also get extras about the main characters and a pronunciation guide for some of the more difficult names. I had problems with pronunciation when I first read the series, so this was very helpful. The way I pronounced Eidolon's name in my head was sooo far off base that it took a bit before I was able to read it the right way. \ud83e\udd13\ud83d\ude02"}, {"userName": "Marianne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16417346-marianne", "userReview": "The compendium is helpful, but I mainly read this because of the seminus brother's story, which was good as always, but sad.

It\u2019s a short encyclopedic reference which gives a brief introduction to the series, descriptions of each of the various demon breeds that are a part of the stories, background on Underworld General Hospital, and descriptions and stats on each of the main characters of the series up through Passion Unleashed. It\u2019s a nice, informative companion reference to the series thus far. I learned a couple of new things by reading it. And since there\u2019s not really anything included that could be considered spoilers, it might be helpful to readers just starting the series to read this first, which is probably why GoodReads has it listed first. Overall, it was an appreciated addition.\nThe Reckoning\n - \u201cThe Reckoning\u201d is an original short story included in the compendium. It takes place about eighty years or so before the main series and tells the story of how Eidolon, Shade, and Roag meet Wraith. They can feel an unknown brother out there and go looking for him, only to find him severely tortured by his mother\u2019s vampire clan and near death. It was interesting to see all the brothers way back in the beginning. Eidolon and Shade have always been great guys and they show that again in this story, making heroic efforts to save Wraith, even though they don\u2019t really even know him. It\u2019s all about family for them, which is why they\u2019re also trying to have a relationship with Roag, who hasn\u2019t yet devolved into the murderous villain that he was in Shade\u2019s book, Desire Unchained. I really enjoyed this little peek into the demon brothers\u2019 early lives."}, {"userName": "C is for **censored**", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3288566-c-is-for-censored", "userReview": "The star rating given reflects my opinion within \u2018the official goodreads rating system\u2019.1 star: Didn\u2019t Like it2 stars: It\u2019s Okay3 stars: Liked it4 stars: Really Liked it5 stars: It Was AmazingI don\u2019t really give a rat-fuck that there are some who think I \u2018owe\u2019 an explanation for my opinion.
