I love her 'Original Sinners' series and I was curious to see how she would do with such a different type of story. While many authors struggle with making this type of a transition, choosing to stick to the same genres and writing similar stories, Ms. Reisz transitioned flawlessly. 'The Bourbon Thief' is storytelling at it's best. I was completely enraptured with this story from start to finish. The narrator for the Audible edition was fabulous, adding a richness to the characters and story. I put my headphones on and got lost in this book for the day. Everything else ceased to exist. It was that good.The story spans several different eras. The story begins in the present day with the femme fatale, Paris, getting caught stealing from the wealthy Cooper following a one night stand. It quickly jumps back decades, as Paris tells the story of the young Tamara Maddox, the sixteen year-old heiress to the Red Thread Bourbon empire. Glimpses are offered of the distant past as well, going back to the beginnings of Red Thread Bourbon during a time when slavery was widespread in the South.Sometimes spoiled and bratty, always stubborn, Tamara proved to be a spirited heroine. Despite my initial reservations where she was concerned, I grew to love Tamara in no time. She was an incredibly strong and loyal character. I admired her tenacity and her commitment to do the right thing, even when that resulted in significant personal hardship. Tamara's life was perfect by all outward appearances. She seemed to have the world at her feet and was an object of envy. However, behind closed doors her family life was anything but perfect.Levi took longer for me to warm up to. He was gruff and, understandably, more guarded than most leading male characters. As a result, it took longer toget to know him. I also felt like he was unnecessarily cold to Tamara at times. Of course, I usually side with the heroine in my stories.I don't want to give too much away, because I think this story needs to be experienced. It is one of those stories that makes you thankful for what you have and drills home the message that the grass isn't always greener. Sometimes a palace is just a bigger prison. You never know the truth of a person's life, unless you've lived that life.I enjoyed every minute of this story. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys great storytelling. The ending alludes to a sequel, which I'll grab up immediately. However, this book reads easily as a standalone and it doesn't leave you hanging."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9916227-jennifer-kyle", "userReview": "5 *Unforgettable* STARS \n\u201dA family with bourbon in it\u2019s blood, and blood on their hands.\u201d\nEverything Tiffany Reisz writes is captivating and this standalone that spans generations is no exception.

The romance here was beautifully written and I have to admit I rooted for these two endearing characters, Tamara and Levy from the very beginning. Tamara was such a unique character. I loved her. Her character is written in such a way you will be drawn to her immediately. As the story progresses you will love her determination and her strength as much as I did, but you will also fall hard and fast for Levy. Levy was a great hero.

Their banter, in fact all their interactions were fantastic, their sexy times hot as hell and their connection as the story progressed palpable and so well done.I can\u2019t recommend this one highly enough.

Amazon US * Amazon UK (Spoiler Free Review posted 28th June)The BOURBON THIEF is pure brilliance.  \u201c...they were born to be together.\u201dAn enchanting tale of betrayal, secrets, lies, revenge, mystery, and scandal. Tiffany Reisz once again captured my imagination, engaging me in the world of THE BOURBON THIEF and a 150 year old mystery. The scandalous tale of Tamara Maddox, heiress to the bourbon empire, is at the heart of this tale and unravels at the hands of Paris as she slowly reveals the story details to Cooper McQueen. And so, the story within the story is told. The present day showcasing a unique tale of the past all crafted with incredible atmosphere, hope, vengeance and love. There are times I didn't know where the story would take me, it kept me on the edge of my seat ensuring my high engagement with the happenings as I contemplated the future of the characters within both the past and present. The third person narrative is executed to perfection allowing me to understand the viewpoints of the main characters depicted within the prose. I learned all about their history and status in the story as pieces of the puzzle took their amazing shape and made my mind work overtime as I attempted to pre-empt what may happen. I felt the frustration at the race inequality that is eloquently illustrated within the tale and also ran riot in our society in recent history. The bourbon legacy and all entwined with it, the good, the bad and the downright ugly is shown to the reader as the writing canvas is painted with words that create the most brilliant, fascinating story. Love is a beautiful feature within the prose; I felt it and basked in the relationship that showed me this love. Equally, the dynamic of Paris the story teller and Cooper the listener is utterly electric and I would love to experience even more from these two characters.Tiffany Reisz once again proves herself as a master story teller with THE BOURBON THEIF. It has a historical, timeless feel to the narrative, yet much of it is set in the 80\u2019s. A story that has provenance and one that vitally needs to unfold naturally and be discovered organically by the reader. I have so many thoughts and feeling that I\u2019d love to share but alas, if I do I will spoil so much of the discovery and sheer wonder of this story. THE BOURBON THIEF is a story I highly recommend to all readers who enjoy perfectly crafted stories of LOVE, HOPE and VENGEANCE. NOTE: THE BOURBAN THIEF is a STANDALONE but I'd love a follow up of certain characters, I feel there's certainly scope for Tiffany Reisz to tell us more about their lives and loves.

The Bourbon Thief begins when a man named Cooper spends the night with a femme fatale named Paris, and wakes up to discover she tried to steal a million dollar bottle of bourbon from him. When he confronts her, she tells him the tale of the downfall of Maddox family and the events leading to the fire that claimed their bourbon factory.Switching from present day point of view to that of Tamara's in the late 70's and early 80's, we are presented with a captivating story of love and suspense of young Tamara and Levi.  \"I'm riding in the wind with joy at my feet and freedom in my hair.\"  This was one of those books where once the story began I was sucked in and wouldn't look up from my kindle. After the introduction of Tamara and Levi, I found myself completely invested in their story, as beautiful and haunting as it was. What was interesting to me was the mystery aspect, which isn't a typical suspense novel but a question of what would happen to these characters based on all of the elements coming to play against them. There were lots of twists and surprises, some I guessed at and some that felt like a punch I was so shocked at them. Ultimately Reisz delivers a beautiful story of love, heartbreak and family and it's a story I could see myself reading again and again.  \"I know I love you.

I read it in one sitting, for the life of me I wasn't able to put it down.So, about the story. I\u2019m not sure if I even want to give away too much.

It's so worth it.If you love the Original Sinners series by Ms. Reisz you should give this standalone southern gothic a try, but be warned it is different. If you've never read anything by the author, this is a good place to start. She spins exceptional tales and really sucks you in from the first page. And when she spits you out on the other side you might find yourself changed a little bit and most definitely stuck in book hangover land.

She has the gift of enticing and teasing without us feeling like she is manipulating us just for fun and games...we feel encouraged to become involved, to care and be one with the characters... and whatever they are feeling... we do too.Now most readers familiar with her past works know how talented she is...for she took ideas and concepts in The Original Sinners Series which may not have been mainstream and made them romantic... she showed how erotic storytelling could be just as heartfelt, literary and of substance than any other genre...and that is not easy.With this new, stand alone novel, she has ventured out into \"women's fiction\" with a strong dose of sensual romance. This book does not take the usual road; it cuts its own path with the use of real pieces and the thought of....and it is good....very good, in deed.The premise has to do with a long lost Bourbon company, Red Thread. It was created owned by the Maddox family for generations and there was only one bottle left in existence; the original first bottle, over 150 years old. Cooper McQueen bought it at auction from the owner...or did he...as he now has a woman named Paris claiming the bottle belongs to her.It is in this moment... a willingness to hear what Paris has to say to prove ownership where the real story begins... For Paris will dole out pieces of lore...the threads of history.... of this company, the Maddox family and what happened to cause Cooper McQueen to listen.And just like Cooper, we do.We are taken back to a time in Kentucky where the powerful perpetrated taking without care or shame. No matter if it was land, money or human property...We are told of sins and the ways of the times with this Maddox family...\nFor this was \"a family with Bourbon in its blood, and blood on its hands.\"\nWith Paris telling Cooper the tale, we learn of everything...yet in her telling we are first taken back to a time not so long ago ... to where we pick up the Maddox family trying to continue the bloodline ... to keep Red Thread going forward with the sons of George Maddox. Her way of telling causes us to feel the heat of the summer... hear the trees rustling and feel the rush of young spirit flowing through the veins in our heroine, Tamara...We are there every moment....and how this is done will rock your reading world. You are immediately immersed in the personality of this girl. You understand right away her mindset... how she thinks and communicates. You understand the pressures and pain of her rich spoiled life...for it is like that Bright Candy Apple on display at the gourmet store...all glowy and pretty...shiny and perfect in its hard shell covering... not a crack anywhere...yet when you break it open... the apple inside is rarely fresh and tasty... it usually is mushy and bitter. This is what Tamara was surrounded with...a family life filled with confusion and pain from loss already at the young age of 16. She, however, was not at all like the diseased core of her family....she was strong and able to pull it together at times so horrific...had the ability to see clearly what she needed to do to survive and be the person she needed to be. We are told of everything she experienced and as I said before...we experience it right along with her.There are others in the story...important pieces to this magnificent puzzle....but I will leave it for you to experience every fantastic moment. Some of this tale will shock you, some will delight in the way you are there during a love story so sweet and confounding at the same time. All of it will Never bore you and cause you to put the book down. As I mentioned before the blurb had been written, Tiffany Reisz had stated this was based on a true story. She touches on those facts at the end of the book. The amount of research and details to bring this to life had to be extensive. It was all worth it. This is a stand alone novel...however, in my heart of hearts... I would love to see more about Paris and Cooper....and with Ms. Reisz' fertile imagination....one never knows....~~~~~ Before Reading ~~~~~\nI am in shock right now as I just received the nod to read this!!!So very excited!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2/2016When I first heard of this from a short comment giving just a hint of this book being based on a true tale about Kentucky Bourbon, I immediately started searching news articles etc... to try to get an idea of what Ms. Reisz could be working on. I read profiles of the Jack Daniels company and all of the shenanigans the original family and new owners were doing. I learned of how this company was structured, how birthright and gender played a serious role...It gave me food for thought but not a true picture of what Ms. Reisz's intentions were...Ah, but now we have the Blurb... the Holy Grail of what she has deemed fit to tantalize us with...To hint at the possibilities and have the clear understanding of how deep this tale will go...For it is the way of Reisz to tease, cause wonder and then so artfully deliver her vision.I am a patient person, Ms. Reisz....work your magic, weave your tale...June 2016 will be here soon enough...and I will be ready.\nA gifted copy was provided by Harlequin (US & Canada) Mira for an honest review.For more Reviews, Free E-books and Giveaways"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "The Bourbon Thief by Tiffany Reisz is a 2016 MIRA publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. I have not read any books by this author, was totally unfamiliar with her work, having chosen this book based solely on the synopsis. Since this book is SO good, I decided to see what other novels, this author may have written\u2026. Okay, I can\u2019t really see myself reading any of Tiffany\u2019s previous titles, but if she writes anymore books like this one\u2026 Kentucky, outrageous wealth, horses and bourbon make a powerful blend, but spike the punch with a little scandal, dark and dirty family secrets, and the most potent ingredient of all- REVENGE- then you got yourself one toxic concoction, one sure to leave you very intoxicated, and maybe even a little hung over. But, if anyone were to ask me if would ever drink from this deadly potion again, the answer would be a resounding \u2013 YES! For Cooper McQueen, very few women can compete with his love for good bourbon. But, when Paris walks into his establishment, she commands his undivided attention in a way no woman ever has before and the night is just getting started. Cooper can\u2019t get enough of Paris and she is more than happy to oblige, leaving him spent and exhausted. But, the spell is broken when he wakes up to find she has stolen a million- dollar bottle of rare bourbon. But, before she can make a clean getaway, she finds herself detained, with Cooper demanding an explanation.Thus begins the spellbinding tale of Tamara Maddox, the sole heir to the Red Ribbon Bourbon dynasty, which built its foundation way back in the last days of the Civil War with money tainted by wicked deeds and spite. The family\u2019s success comes at a high price, and by the time Tamara is sixteen years old, any hope of a male heir is fading rapidly. The desperation to bring a male child into the family will set off a series of unfathomable events that will blow the doors wide open exposing years of lurid secrets, lies and cover-ups, prompting Tamara to exact the ultimate revenge. Whoa! This is one wild tale and no, it\u2019s not always pretty, but as twisted as this sounds, it\u2019s my kind of story. I really liked this novel, which is deeply steeped in southern history, with just a little bit of a Southern Gothic slant, which is kind of rare these days. \u201cA family with bourbon in its blood, and blood on its hands\u201d This story blends history, mystery, suspense and romance together to create an unusual love story, told with a deft skill, which created a fireside atmosphere, while throwing explosive twists and turns at you, which had me sitting bug eyed, and slack jawed, with my heart in my throat, wondering what could possibly happen next. Trust me, Paris really knows how to weave a tale. This story is unconventional, the characters vastly different from any you have ever encountered before, something which I really need right now, in order to keep my attention and avoid burn out on the same old, same old. I loved Tamara, who set a course for new generations that will go a long way towards eradicating her tainted heritage. She was funny, smart, and tough, full of determination and grit. Likewise, her beloved Levi, was the cool ointment in her life that healed her troubled soul, gave her hope, stability, peace and happiness. Controversial\u2026 yes, very. But, did they do the right thing? Definitely. Do I want more like stories like this one?PLEASE! Please, bring Paris and Cooper back for more great fireside tales.

I couldn't put it down, even though some may call it slow placed. I was obsessed with the banter of the hero and heroine and while some may not consider any of this humorus because of the dark and vengeful underlying tone of the plot, I did laugh multiple times at the quick witted dialogue between the two MCs.The premise of this book revolves around a long lost bourbon company, Red Thread, that was originally founded and owned by the Maddox family for generations. Many years after Red Thread's demise, a woman named Paris tracks down the last remaining bottle and tries to reclaim it by telling the sordid tale of the company's origins and how it all eventually fell apart.

Throughout the book there was this anxious, heavy feeling that I couldn't shake, so I was waiting for that inevitable shoe to drop. And when it dropped, HOLY SHIT DID IT DROP.This is not your typical love story. This is not your typical drama. \nIt was right and wrong and mysterious and delightful and tragic all at the same time.\n I also found it extremely interesting this story was inspired by true events and the author was able to conjure such a wicked tale from them. I would most definitely recommend it to those who aren't afraid to read something that is outside of the box and a little outside of their comfort zone.*ARC provided via Netgalley in exchange for an honest reviewThe Bouron Thief is out now!: http://amzn.to/28XwFio\nFind Me On:Instagram \u2764 FB Page \u2764 FB Blog \u2764 Blog"}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "4,5-5 STARS\"They call bourbon the honest spirit..\"Such an interesting, mysterious and mesmerizing story.

The masterful mind of Tiffany Reisz does it like no other. The Bourbon Thief is told as a story from the past, a past intertwined with the present. The past is needed in order to obtain the first bottle ever made of Red Thread Bourbon. A bottle significant to rectifying past sins. But in order for a mysterious black woman named Paris to get that bottle, she must tell the owner of the bottle, Cooper McQueen, the story of the downfall of Red Thread Bourbon. And so the tale begins.......\nThe Maddoxes have bourbon in their blood\u2014and blood in their bourbon. \nTwo events change the course of Tamara Maddox's life. She is only heir to Red Thread. Levi Shelby is the the stable hand at her farm. Their age difference of 16 and 29 is not significant to me. It's just the way it is and it works. The author weaves their story as one of convenience but it develops into something rich and captivating. Their development, their situation, their lives in Kentucky and South Caroline is full of determination and strength to rectify the past and make amends. Their relationship transitions into something more, something deep and emotional. But the journey they embark on is not easy, it's shroud in secrets and lies. It is all fascinating, scintillating, eerie and it's just a Wonderfully Exquisitely Well Written Book!!!You really must experience this story in its pure version. I'm saying that not knowing much and letting the story unfold before your eyes is the best way to experience and absorb the sheer genius of this story. Sorry but there is no way to tell you more about the story without spoiling.In closing, this story is Tiffany Reisz at her finest. She tells a story that completely holds you captive. It's an unveiling of layers, slowly, deliberately, keeping you mesmerized...page by page, chapter by chapter. The sins of the past lurking at every corner. Secrets and lies create twists and turns that leave you breathless. The telling of a story within a story done ever so BRILLIANTLY as only Tiffany Reisz can. \nARC provided by Netgalley in exchange for an honest reviewOne-click----> http://amzn.to/2967fDb"}, {"userName": "warhawke", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25494927-warhawke", "userReview": "Genre: General FictionType: StandalonePOV: Third PersonRating: Cooper McQueen had a love affair with bourbon.

One fateful night, a beautiful woman in red lured him into his bed, only to disappear with his prized bottled of the original Red Thread by morning.Paris Christie only had one thing on her mind \u2013 to avenge for her family. And the bottle of bourbon held the key to it. In order to get it her way, she regaled the tale of affairs and betrayals from the Red Thread's inception to its demise with the key players of teenage girl, Tamara Maddox of the family who owned the company and the family stable man, Levi Shelby.Before reading this book, I wasn't completely sure what it's about but when it is written by my favorite author I knew it wasn't even a risky undertaking and I was right. And true to the author's signature style, this book told a story within a story. The book started in the present with Cooper and Paris and progressed and merged with the story of Tamara and Levi in the past.\n \u201cYou\u2019re boring the hell out of me. I liked it better when you were a spoiled rotten brat.\u201d\nI absolutely love Levi. He was snappy and snarky but with a good heart which reminds me of Nora, my favorite female character ever from The Original Sinners series by the author.Tamara was young and had to carry her family burden. Even though at times she acted her age, she was strong and determined. She had great chemistry with Levi and their banters were highly entertaining.\n The Maddox family is cursed, they say, and I believe it. And once you touch one, get inside one, the curse is in you, too.\nThe story was absolutely engaging and told in a somewhat slower pace to make readers satisfied yet crave for more. The scandalous family drama ranging from heartbreaking to downright disturbing fully immersed readers into the Red Threads legacy.The Bourbon Thief is a richly layered tale of family, money and power with a splash of romance guaranteed to satisfy like the smooth burn of a prized spirit.\u265e \u2756 \u265e (F)BR With Twinsie CC & Loyda \u265e \u2756 \u265eFor more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit:"}, {"userName": "CC", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12625026-cc", "userReview": "5++ Stars! Paris knows who owns the first bottle of Red Thread Bourbon and she executes a plan to steal it from Cooper McQueen.

But I need it.\u201d \nTamara Maddox is a precocious teenager who lives a gilded existence on her Grandaddy\u2019s sprawling Kentucky estate. On the outside, Tamara seems to have what every teen girl would want; a horse, a car and friends, but she is no stranger to loss, death and disharmony within the Maddox family. On her 16th birthday, Tamara heads to the stable to ride her horse and to see the ever handsome and older man, Levi Shelby, the stable groom. As innocent as Tamara may be, she begs Levi for a kiss and he obliges. \n\u201cYou are playing with fire, little girl,\u201d Levi said into her ear. \u201cI\u2019m not a little girl anymore,\u201d she said, looking up at him.\u201d \nFrom this point, destiny intervenes and the Maddox family curse continues to weave itself into the blood of those intricately weaved within the Maddox family. Years of greed, wealth, power, deceit and hubris have created strong Maddox patriarchs who stopped at nothing to ensure the passing of their fortune to rightful heirs. However, after one fateful night, Tamara is given a dubious choice and her sole decision has the ability to right history and to possibly achieve her own happiness. \n \u201cThe Maddox family is cursed, they say, and I believe it. And once you touch one, get inside one, the curse is in you, too.\u201d \nTamara is a unique heroine, because despite her age, she bears an inner strength and resolve that the Maddox men ironically and simply do not share. Her resilience is originally founded in the ideal of love but in order to come full circle, she must take the path of revenge and destruction. From the first page of introduction to Tamara, I was immediately drawn to her. As for Levi, the man is a girl\u2019s wet dream for a hot horseman and quickly proves he isn\u2019t just a pretty face but a man of substance. Lastly, the secondary characters in this novel certainly and convincingly make their mark adding to the plot dimension. The path that Tiffany Reisz takes the reader is engrossing and cleverly constructed to slowly reveal layer upon layer of lies and treachery. The twists and turns in this plot are disturbing at times yet every event enhances the characters, plot and tone. If you are looking for a complex and richly devious story with characters that evoke an immediate and lasting emotive response, I highly recommend The Bourbon Thief!This was a (F)BR with Hawkey and Loyda!

She always create kick-ass feisty heroine paired up with alpha smart-ass hero. As always, Ms. Reisz gave us something thrilling and engaging in her story.Before we start:Divided by past and present from 3rd POV, The Bourbon Thief gave us tell-a-tell kind of story. Present day, Cooper McQueen was wealthy man who enjoys his bourbon collection especially Red Thread. A beautiful stranger managed to captivate his attention and robbed him blindly. Paris only wants the phenomenal bourbon Red Thread from McQueen but she's gonna give him the story behind it. A hell of a story that Cooper McQueen couldn't forget.It begins in 1978 and Tamara Maddox (16) has a 'perfect' life as the heir of the most famous bourbon distillery. It is only amazing from outside, but everything is rotten inside. Tamara didn't realize her wish to be kissed by Levi will bring chaos to the family. Levi Shelby (30) is the most handsome man and her first love. He's also work for Maddox family; but not for a long time. After the great flood that night, Tamara discovered the dark secrets within Maddox family and she start to plan everything.\n\n\u201cWhich one am I? The young or the restless?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the restless, obviously,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re so so so old, and I\u2019m so so so young.\u201d\u201cWill it shut you up if I kiss you?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t talk with a tongue in my mouth, right?\u201d\n\nTamara and Levi destined for each other. In their era, some white people still despise black people because they used to be a slave. I really enjoyed this book so much despite some cringed-worthy moments. With secrets, lies and deceits Maddox family has really fucked-up history since their ancestor and it is still running until Tamara's. Money and power tainted by blood also the truth behind Red Thread.Two years later, finally Tamara married Levi with the plan for Maddox. Levi still has clear conscience with his action because the age problem despite he really like her. The bumpy road of communication became the main problem when Levi realize Tamara's real intention for him. But it didn't take long for them to admit their own mistakes. When you're really in love, you will do anything for her/him right? Yeah, that's what Levi did all this time until the end. He always be there for Tamara and vice versa. Tamara was quite mature on her age. Her plan for Maddox was brilliant but again, the lies behind secrets couldn't be trusted. Every perfect plan has it flaws, they said.Maybe I kinda confused with some events that happened with Tamara. I almost thought it mix with something paranormal. But it isn't. Overall, everything is really fascinated me. Unpredictable with twist after twist. How talented Ms. Reisz describe as history fiction based on something I'm not familiar. I never know anything about Bourbon but this book really gave me a great image. I also happened to know about the racial and slavery issue in those era and yeah, that was very horrible. I'm amazed with Tamara and Levi's change after their marriage and so much happened in their 'honeymoon'. They fought, survived and live happily ever after, leaving Maddox's name and Red Thread behind with sacrifices.After I finished: P.s. Levi is a deadly combination with S\u00f8ren's smart-ass and Kingsley's love.\u2726 Please visit @Midnight Romance for more reviews! \u2726"}, {"userName": "Natasha is a Book Junkie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9389992-natasha-is-a-book-junkie", "userReview": "\u201cYou\u2019re the only thing I still love from before.

In a time of racial stress and a struggle for human empathy and understanding in America, this book of fiction contributes much needed perspective in my opinion. It shows examples of white privilege, the frustrations of persons of color who live a never-ending history of being viewed/treated differently, and it offers a necessary perspective of how slavery continues to impact an entire race. It\u2019s present in family trees, in the memories of precious elders, in coffee table photo albums, and at the core roots of some successful businesses that continue to thrive today. Slavery may already have found a place in the history books but it lingers still. The Bourbon Thief is quality entertainment; it\u2019s complex as all get out with family, cultural, and historical dynamics, it has an engaging romance with one hell of a jaw-dropping revelation (just wait for it!), and the storytelling is superb as a present-day narrator takes us into the past. I hope every reader also gains some additional insight though. I loved this book and absolutely adore Ms. Reisz for writing it...whether she meant for it to have such an impact or not. Read it!My favorite quote:\u201cHow are you going to get revenge against dead people? Dig \u2019em up and stake \u2019em through the heart?\u201d \u201cI asked myself that same question, and I think I know the answer. You destroy what they loved, and you love what they destroyed.\u201dNote: For readers who follow Ms. Reisz, it's important to note that The Bourbon Thief is more historical fiction with a touch of mystery and less of the erotica you may be accustomed to from her. I wouldn't want your expectations to be too disappointed, wink wink. However, she wouldn't be our fabulous Tiffany Reisz if she didn't push the envelope in some way.

So when it was announced that she was releasing something totally different I was hesitant, would I love it? Well, the answer is a resounding YES! This story was perfection.\n\n\u201cLove is simply the name of the desire and the pursuit of the whole.\u201d\n\nThrough Tiffany Reisz\u2019s trademark literary prose I was transported to the South into the lives of whiskey barons with no scruples and where racism was rife. Where love was never a foundation of a marriage, only blood lines and inheritances mattered. Totally captivating, intriguing and suspenseful, Tiffany Reisz delivers a story of how whiskey was deemed liquid gold, it was the be all and end all. Battles were won and lost over a glass as were lives, but this book centres around one family in particular, the Maddoxes that had whiskey running through their veins, a bourbon that once made them millions before ultimately becoming their demise\u2026now only one bottle remains\u2026worth millions\u2026one bottle of Red Thread.\n\n\u201cFuck your father. Fuck your grandfather. Fuck his father. Fuck you, Jacob fucking Maddox. If y\u2019all hadn\u2019t fucked so much, you wouldn\u2019t be so fucking fucked.\u201d\n\nTiffany Reisz delivers a heartfelt love story that was told in an incredibly clever way that embraces both past and present. Where true stories are shared over glasses of the same whiskey that caused nothing but death and heartache in the past. Where that one remaining bottle becomes the hottest property and becomes the sole objective of The Bourbon Thief. \n\n\u201cI curse you all from the branches to the roots. Veritas will rule your house.\u201d\n\nCooper McQueen owns said bottle, Paris wants said bottle but when caught in the act Paris spills the tale of its heritage and transports us back to 1978 with a totally unforgettable and heart wrenching story that spans generations. Tamara and Levi\u2019s story is truly unforgettable, there will be many tears but a lot of laughs too and many a swoon. A story of how these two created something beautiful from tragedy and a love story that will hold you captive from the very beginning.\n\n\u201cTell the truth. That shouldn\u2019t be too hard.\u201d\u201cThe truth is the hardest thing to say.\u201d\n\nI am being deliberately vague because this is a story that needs to experienced first-hand, you need to feel and experience every single emotion that Tiffany Reisz has bled onto the pages. Tiffany Reisz entices you word by word and will have you eating out of the palm of her hand in no time at all. This was one of those books where you find yourself holding your breath while you turn the pages frantically awaiting the next word. Exquisite perfection.\n\n\u201cShakespeare is boring. Read something better, like Jackie Collins.\u201d\n\nThis was one addictive read from start to finish and one that I couldn\u2019t put down. With twists aplenty that will only leave you wishing the story was longer, I didn\u2019t want to leave these characters behind. Tiffany Reisz has once again left her indelible mark on my heart and soul. I lived and breathed these characters, their life story is one that I will never forget and never will I be able to look at a bottle of bourbon the same again.\n\n\u201cLove what they destroyed.Destroy what they loved.\u201d\n\nwww.theromancecover.com"}, {"userName": "*TANYA*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29049556-tanya", "userReview": "Fantastic book!!!

Her gift and raw talent for telling stories within stories is untouchable.

And the debauchery continues. Cursed because of greed the gluttonous history of Red Thread Bourbon unfolds brilliantly captivating readers. The story told within the pages of The Bourbon Thief is best consumed without any prior knowledge of the story. Go in with no expectations and find yourself immersed in the brilliance. If you've read Tiffany Reisz novels before you're familiar with her brilliant, one-of-a kind style of story telling. If you're not familiar I believe this book is a really great place to start. It's grand in the structure of the plot, unfolding mysteriously through the eyes of someone in present day relaying a beautiful love story from the past. Reisz incorporates her usual flair for the taboo and forbidden elements. Intermixed with a story of devastating pain and unbreakable love she creates a world where you literally don't want to leave. You're haunted by the ugliness of it while equally enchanted by it's charm. Like sitting around a fire with a good glass of your favorite poison so involved with the story you're being told you have no idea how many hours have gone by. Tiffany Reisz is a favorite author of mine. All of her books are favorites of mine. Her characters are one of a kind. This particular story is unlike anything I've read before. So familiar to Reisz' signature style yet so different from her previous works. I'm in awe of her story-telling chops and the marvelous stories she brings to life creating visceral reactions in her readers. The Bourbon Thief is a new favorite of mine and I hope to spend more time in this world and look forward to wherever else Reisz plans to take me. This is a high priority, definite recommendation. I want everyone to read it. Whether it's your first Reisz book or your tenth, The Bourbon Thief is a MUST READ."}, {"userName": "Sophie \"Beware Of The Reader\"", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18451976-sophie-beware-of-the-reader", "userReview": "The Bourbon Thief by Tiffany Reisz5 \u201cincredible family saga\u201d starsIn two words: terribly beautiful.When the girls on Natasha is a Book Junkie FB group asked who was game for a Bourbon Thief \u2018s group read I did not hesitate. A good friend had gifted the book and it was already on my Kindle. I had seen many good reviews and I was intrigued. What was all the fuss about? Well know I know why this book made the buzz.Take a good narrator, a pinch of history, two spoons of slavery and a whole pint of revenge. Stir it all with great characters, smart writing and your recipe will be a hit.\nThe blurb already gives you a whiff of Tiffany\u2019s stellar writing. That woman knows how to write beautiful sentences and how to tell an enthralling story. Her writing style is gorgeous. It flows effortlessly with enough details to make us see the tale in hour head, walk in the character\u2019s shoes but without unnecessary frills. It\u2019s good, solid and elegant. I know this won\u2019t be my last Tiffany Reisz\u2019s book.The writing was excellent but I still feared the worse at first.I thought I would be cursed again with a \u201cmildly interesting \u201cbook. The encounter between Paris and McQueen was described quite clinically. They had sex but for all the (lack of) details they could have been rescuing penguins on the Arctic ice and I would have felt more heat and passion. What had I signed for?Fortunately once Paris began her tale about Tamara Maddox\u2019s dark and cursed soap opera of a life I was entranced.\n\u201cOn December 10, 1978, two very important events in the history of Red Thread occurred\u2014the Kentucky River broke its banks and crested at a record forty-eight feet, and the granddaughter of George J. Maddox, the owner of Red Thread Bourbon Distillery, turned sixteen years old. That was the beginning of the end of Red Thread.\u201d \u201cWhat was? The river flooding?\u201d Paris gave him a smile, a smile that made him momentarily rethink his decision to not call the police. \u201cTamara Maddox.\u201d\n I could not stop reading about all that happened to this brave girl. It was horrifying and fascinating. I won\u2019t tell much about the plot but know that she got blow after blow and yet she survived. The leading men in her life were real b@stards hiding under the veneer of respected powerful men. It began decades before her birth when the white exploited black slaves. Her story was intertwined with that of another young girl from a pas era. \n\u201cHer eyes softened as she touched the red ribbon tied around the bottle\u2019s neck. It was a tattered old thing. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that thing has stayed on there,\u201d McQueen said. \u201cPiece of ribbon from the 1860s.\u201d \u201cSlave cloth,\u201d Paris said. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThe ribbon was cut from slave cloth. Thick wool. Slave cloth was made to last a long time. Slaves didn\u2019t get new clothes very often. What they had had to last, had to hold up to hard work and many years. The girl who wore this ribbon? This was probably the only nice thing she had, the only thing she thought of as hers.\u201d\nLet me tell you reading about slavery and about entitled rich men was no picnic. Why do people think they are worthier than others just because their skin is a paler shade? Why do these old fashioned powerful men think they can use women for their pleasure and just discard them once the toy is not shiny anymore? And if you think it only happened in the past you\u2019ll be so far from the truth you\u2019ll never find your way back. Seriously I was appalled by what women had to endure in this story.Slowly I unfold the threads of this family curse. \n\u201cWe tell ourselves lies to survive when we know the truth will kill us.\u201d\nThe Arctic ice was long forgotten once the stable boy lost his shirt it\u2019s a miracle my tongue is not still glued to my Kindle. Soon after I was left once more mouth agape as I could not believe what I\u2019d just read! What nearly happened to Tamara was just\u2026horrifying. And when you think you finally know the whole truth the story just takes a 180\u00b0 turn. I felt like an MMA fighter once he got his first beating.Hell bent on revenge the girl will be clever, patient and cunning. She may seem like a sweet red haired little thing but she\u2019s a core of steel. That\u2019s a girl following my heart! Go girl! Make them regret what they did a thousand times! I was out for blood\u2026\n\u201cLove what they destroyed. Destroy what they loved.\u201d\nI think you could follow my mood and subsequently the twists and turns just by looking at my face. Eyes bulging, heart pit pattering, white knuckles in tense moments and goofy grin when quick witted Tamara made fun of Levi. \n\u201cI do care about you. I did and I do. But you drive me up one wall and down the other sometimes and I swear I\u2019m looking down at you from the ceiling right now.\n A real emotional rollercoaster.Cooper McQueen was entranced by Paris\u2019s tale but so was I. I forgot everything and everyone. I was in Kentucky in the stable, the woods or in that cursed mansion. My hair was long and red. My crush was tall and handsome and I loved driving him crazy. I carried the weight of a doomed family. Revenge was my middle name. That my friend is the trade mark of a very good book.You want to follow all my reviews and rants?

Storytelling is most definitely Tiffany Reisz\u2019s strongest suit. I was completely captivated with the story. The first chapter was nothing special honestly (exactly what the blurb says), but then the story of Tamara Maddox begins and you are under its spell. Around 20% mark was the big shock, I was honestly stunned, but then I remembered - this is Tiffany Reisz after all, you should expect something twisted. \nHer body was his body. His body was hers. He saw himself through her eyes\u2014older, bigger, beautiful to her in that strange way girls found men beautiful, and knowing things she wanted to know. She envied him his freedom, that he was a man and could do anything he wanted to anyone he wanted, while she had to marry him to escape the prison of her life and the prison of the world\u2019s expectations.\n The story is a times heavy and tragic, but there are these comic moments which prevent it from being too dark. And there is of course the hot, passionate and forbidden love story between Tamara and Levi. (*swoon*)The story itself had me turning pages like crazy\u2026 but at the same time, there is this undertone of, I don\u2019t know how to put it.. Nostalgia, maybe? Like you\u2019re reminiscing about that amazing Summer you had 5 years ago and can never have back. That\u2019s how I felt about Tamara & Levi, I loved them, I was drinking up every minute of their story, but all the while thinking it can\u2019t last, I feel like something is going to happen... Now, of course I\u2019m not going to reveal anything, that\u2019s just the feeling I had, and I loved the way Reisz structured the story. I like when I don\u2019t know if the story would end happily or not. Furthermore, if you\u2019re already a fan of Tiffany Reisz you know you can expect that she\u2019ll rip out your heart a little, mesmerize you with the story, shock, disturb, and make you question. And if you\u2019re not, well then you have some idea as to what to expect.In conclusion, is the story of revenge, passionate love and one cursed family and it\u2019s definitely one of my favorite books of 2016!\n\nOne of these days you\u2019re going to get what you want and it\u2019ll be the last thing you want.\n\n**This review is also at Way Too Hot Books.**"}], "description": "From the internationally celebrated author of the Original Sinners series comes a brand-new tale of betrayal, revenge and a family scandal that bore a 150-year-old mysteryWhen Cooper McQueen wakes up from a night with a beautiful stranger, it's to discover he's been robbed.
