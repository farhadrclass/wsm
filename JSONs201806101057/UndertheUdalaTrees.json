It has what I would call a quiet power to it. Okparanta has created something special here, something that's moving and resilient and important. It's the story of conflict and reconciliation, of a nation at war with itself, of a mother and daughter at war with each other, and ultimately of a girl at war with her identity and how she comes to acceptance. It's beautifully written and told, and I can't wait to read more from this author. Only small complaint is I felt the epilogue was unnecessary. Loved how it ended right before that. Otherwise, perfection!"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "This debut novel will reach deep into your heart and mind.... a story which stays forever! Ijeoma is only 11 years old when her father dies. As a young child, when one parent dies, ( I know this from experience), they often feel as though they've lost both parents. Everything changes instantly and dramatically. This happened to Ijeoma. She and her mother loose their living comforts...from their upper class,( more elite) home to being rather poor. The entire country is hurting as the Civil War had just broke out in Nigeria. On top of this, ( more loss...feelings of abandonment), Ijeoma's mother sends her to livewith another couple...( a teacher and his wife). It's suppose to be a short time, while themother can figure out her plans - then bring her back home soon..( this happened to me too... I remember being sent to live in another house for about a half year)... but for Ijeoma, it was a 2 year separation. If the entire story was about a young girl coming of age living in a country at war - withher home life completely broken ...and how she survives ...it could have been enough for a novel....BUT...This story takes place in a very religious and conservative country. Add to the challenge that Ijeoma has a lesbian experience and gets caught. She had no acceptance with her country or her mother. It can be dangerously threatening to be a homosexual in the 60's and 70's in Nigeria. Ijeoma was not an out spoken rebel type....( who would be given her circumstances?), fighting for gay rights...but she did spend a lot of time deeply thinking about God and the bible in regards to sexuality. She was grappling with why there couldn't be an\"Eve and Eve\"in the Bible, with the same reasons there was an Adam and Eve. We take a journey with Ijeoma into adulthood. One 'small' wonder....( maybe I'm a na\u00efvet\u00e9 63 year old), but I was the same age as Ijeoma in America during the 1960's, as Ijeoma was in Nigeria. I was sooo removed from thoughts of having sex with anyone...male or female, at age 11, 12. or 13. Ok... so, maybe, I'm just na\u00efvet\u00e9 as I say. - but I kept thinking .., \" so young?\"Regardless of age, I sympathized with Ijeoma's......wishing her inner peace...with love and freedom. It was Ijeoma's faith, that gave her strength, against no agreement. \"Sometimes I sit with my Bible in my hands, and I think to myself that God is nothing but an artist, and the world is this canvas. And I reason that if the old and New Testament are any indication, of change is the fact a major part of His aesthetic, a major part of His visionfor the world. The Bible itself is an endorsement of change\". * It breaks my heart ... to read in the AUTHORS NOTES...that in January, 2014, The president signed a bill criminalizing same-sex relationships, making these offenses punishable up to 14 years in prison. Hopefully ... this book is planting seeds of Justice around the globe. Thank You to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing, Netgalley, and Chinelo Okparanta for the opportunity to read this book! This book makes a difference!"}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "A beautifully crafted tale of forbidden love, mostly set during and immediately after the Biafran war, but inspired by Nigeria's recent decision to outlaw homosexual acts. Ijeoma is an Igbo girl from a middle class family whose world is shaken when her father is killed by a bomb, and her mother is forced to send her out to be a servant girl while she finds a place to survive. Here she meets Amina, a Hausa orphan, and persuades her employers to take her in. They start a lesbian relationship, but when this is discovered, Ijeoma is sent home. Her mother attempts to reeducate her using Biblical quotations, but is unable to prevent the two girls ending up at the same school, where they drift apart.Returning to her mother's village, Ijeoma meets another woman Ndidi, but is soon forced to marry her childhood friend Chibundu. The rest of the book follows the story of her unhappy marriage, with a brief postscript set in the present day.Okparanta is a talented story-teller. The first part of the narrative is interesting in that she reveals a few key events before describing them in detail. Most of the chapters are short and direct, and there are plenty of lighter moments. Nigeria's intolerant religious beliefs form a powerful background, and Ijeoma's own complex relationship with God and religion is explored in some depth."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9420458-jennifer", "userReview": "\u201cWith a man, life is difficult. Without a man, life is even more difficult. Take it from me.\"Like many artists before her, author Chinelo Okparanta took to her craft as a way to address oppressive governmental policies. In 2014, the year before this book was written Okparanta's native Nigeria passed some of the most stringent laws in the world against homosexuality. Those found to be \"guilty\" of homosexuality could be sentenced to decades in prison or death by stoning. Okparata's beautiful and heartbreaking novel tells the story of young Ijeoma who comes of age during Nigeria's bloody and tumultuous civil war. During that period she discovers the nature of her desire and the realization that she is attracted to women, not men. The author does a brillant job of exploring Ijeoma's inner thoughts as she wrestles with her faith, the relationship with her mother, and societal expectations.4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Monica ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica", "userReview": "What an amazing book!! Deeply personal and thoughtful!! A beautiful story, beautifully told. I was not expecting to be so captivated. I think what got me was the humanness of it all. The world building was superb. I knew I was reading about another country entirely with different culture etc and yet I connected with Ijeoma. I understood her points of view and shared many of her perceptions. The first half of the book with the religious dogma was interesting to me, but I was completely detached. The moment someone starts to explain their questionable behavior or point of view by telling me what the bible says; it\u2019s just like flipping an off switch. I\u2019m not listening. But Ijeoma comes from a background where the bible gave her family hope. It was the very foundation of their lives. She not only has internal conflicts with biological imperatives, but with the very foundations of what her parents have laid out for her. Interestingly enough, I found commonality in the second half of the book regardless of sexual preference. The desire to carve out a life that is meaningful and comfortable and pleasant. Finding your way through life is difficult on its own, even more so if you are gay and living in a very ignorant and intolerant country. But Ijeoma\u2019s basic struggle was the same as everyone else; finding herself and figuring out a way to carve out a happy life. I have a heterosexual friend right now staring at a marriage to a person that is amiable and kind but there is no love. The hope is for a comfortable life with someone who is acceptable to the family. Love and intimacy are sacrificed to the idea of what is a societal norm. They wish and hope and pray that those things will grow with time. Ijeoma says it herself when she says \u201cThere\u2019s a way in which life takes us along for a ride and we begin to think that our destinies are not in fact up to us.\u201d One of the most self-destructive, almost universally applied axioms/antidotes/cure all/solutions to life\u2019s issues is the notion of \u201cgive it time\u201d or \"give it a chance\". It wasn\u2019t until Ijeoma gave everything she had to make things work within the conventional norms that her mother finally accepted who Ijeoma was. But there was a tremendous amount of suffering and destruction in a lot of lives before her mother came around. Isn\u2019t that part of what is goes on in everyone\u2019s life at some point? We spend a tremendous amount of effort trying to conform to societal norms often leaving a destructive wake while denying our true selves. Trying to be what someone else expects. It was gratifying that her mother came around in the end. It was gratifying that Ijeoma is living her truth now. She still has to hide herself from society, but at least she doesn\u2019t have to hide from her mother. In spite of her mother\u2019s initial reservations and behavior, she was Ijeoma\u2019s rock in life and her support. I believe that her mother did love her and wanted what\u2019s best for her. She never outright rejected her daughter. That Ijeoma at the end of her marriage went back to her mother\u2019s house and said \u201cMama, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t anymore.\u201d says this to me. She had a place to go. Her mother didn\u2019t abandon her. I came to love her mother. She was doing the best she knew how to do and in the end she chose her daughter over everything including religious teachings. And through everything, Ijeoma still managed to stay true to herself and to retain her faith. Her mother\u2019s last line says it all \u201cKa udo di, ka ndu di.\u201d Let peace be, let life be."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "It is impossible for me to review this book without first addressing the \u201cwhy\u201d of its genesis. Just last year, Nigeria \u2013 the birthplace of Chinelo Okparanta \u2013 passed one of the world\u2019s most punitive laws against same-sex relationships, including lengthy prison sentences and in the northern states, death by stoning. As someone who strongly believes that healthy and reciprocal love between two people \u2013 regardless of gender \u2013 is always a good thing, I can\u2019t help but applaud this young author for providing a voice for so many in Nigeria who are forced to deny their authentic selves.That being said, I typically default in reacting to a book not to its worthy themes, but how it succeeds in advancing those themes. And here, I must admit to some disappointment.Having read Happiness Like Water, I know what heights Chinelo Okparanta is capable of reaching. In that collection, she writes devastatingly about women and children seeking shelter from abusive husbands, gay lovers who must forego love because one is acquiescing to an arranged marriage, and other traumas. It was \u2013 and remains \u2013 a fine debut.In Under the Udala Trees, Ms. Okparanta states that her novel is attempting to \u201cgive Nigeria\u2019s marginalized LGBTQ citizens a more powerful voice, and a place in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d The book is, at its core, a coming-of-age story in which the narrator --Ijeoma \u2013 is sent to live with friends of the family during wartime. Her sexual and emotional awakening at the hands of another displaced girl, Amina, sets in motion a long struggle for self-acceptance.Ms. Okparanta writes beautifully, lucidly, and at times, devastatingly; at no point did I want to abandon the book. In fact, once I started reading, I eagerly turned pages. But I couldn\u2019t help but feel as if she were leading me to conclusions, rather than let me reach them on my own. Nigeria is the second-most religious nation in the world; the author writes, \u201cIt\u2019s the Church that has interpreted God\u2019s words to its own benefit\u2026My point is that business is the reason for things like doctrines. Business is the reason for words like \u2018abomination\u2019.\u201dNo argument there. But somehow, I wanted Ms. Okparanta to go further than what has now become the sad givens: the hypocrisy and perniciousness of religion, the valuing of male children above female children, the forcing of loving people to deny their own realities in order to conform and to enter into false marriages. In ways, I felt this novel could easily be classified as young-adult fiction (and, for the record, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My belief is that To Kill A Mockingbird, one of the classics of American fiction, is also YA). For me \u2013 and this is entirely subjective \u2013 I wanted more thematic surprises."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9706360-jane", "userReview": "This book was amazing and EVERYONE should read it!I had Americanah-like chills while reading this. It dealt with so many serious feminist issues, particularly the role of religion and the condemnation of homosexuality. Ijeoma's thoughts and opinions on religion have been buzzing around my own mind lately so it was especially cathartic to read. There's nothing better than an incredibly well-written book that tackles very serious human issues.I will definitely be reading anything and everything else by this author."}, {"userName": "Adam Dalva", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3263980-adam-dalva", "userReview": "Addictive, quick novel that takes on the horrendous homophobic conditions in Nigeria with a decades-spanning narrative. Okparanta is a writer of great restraint, comfortable with quick, punchy scenes and large time jumps, and her plot-work is excellent. You find yourself caring about the lead, her two forbidden affairs with men, and her marriage to a man who she can not possibly love. The husband is a particularly well-mapped character - in a different book, in a different story, his narrative would be a happy one, and despite his cruelties, the book takes care to treat him three-dimensionally. This makes his atrocities all the more devastating.I do think the novel started going way too fast around the 1/3rd mark: scenes became things we were told; the narrative exclusively focused on queer relationships and didn't give us any aspect of Ijeoma's life; the first relationship, with Amina, never quite figures out how to get back into the novel and it makes the second relationship less interesting in contrast. This is only a theory, but I have the suspicion that novels written in workshops tend to front-load their scene work and then rush through their conclusions. Without the lyricism and suspense of the early part of the book, I had to fight the urge to read for plot alone."}, {"userName": "Lark Benobi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73768036-lark-benobi", "userReview": "Under the Udala Trees is restrained compared with almost any other novel I've ever read about a child growing up in time of war. There are terrible things happening throughout the novel, but somewhat obliquely. After reading many memoirs and novels that have no such restraint I kept being surprised when this main character was never raped or maimed or burned at the stake, all things that the author could have chosen to have happen to her protagonist. The language here is simple and straightforward and feels like appropriate language for this character, what she might sound like while telling her own first person story--she doesn't speak like a writer, she speaks like a person. So she will say things like \"you could hear a pin drop\" and you might say it's cliche' writing or you might say it's a natural speaking voice shining out of the story itself. The way these things feel to you will have a lot of influence on whether you enjoy the novel or not."}, {"userName": "Ryan Dejonghe", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21649558-ryan-dejonghe", "userReview": "\u201cE\u2019li, E\u2019li, la\u2019ma sab ach tha\u2019ni? My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d is the question Ijeoma asks in the novel UNDER THE UDALA TREES by Chinelo Okparanta. The year was 1968. Her father was killed in Nigeria\u2019s violent assimilation of Biafra, her mother\u2014at the end of her wits. Tears will fall from your eyes as Ijeoma prays, \u201cDear God, I want to be happy. Please help me to be happy.\u201dTHE MOTHER, THE HUSBAND, THE CHILDNot knowing what to do, Ijeoma\u2019s mother sent her away, to be properly cared for and taught. During this separation, Ijeoma fell in love with another girl. This girl: a Hausa girl, someone Ijeoma\u2019s Igbo people would never associate. This girl: a reader of the Koran. All things: an anathema. We witness Ijeoma\u2019s struggle in finding love, eventually succumbing to the heart-wrenching persuasion of man-woman marriage.

The mother, Ijeoma, the people all around, each coming to a realization of who God is, where He abides, and the trueness of their hearts. BACK TO NIGERIAThis is the third book I\u2019ve read that is based in Nigeria. The latest being the multi-award-nominated THE FISHERMEN. I am honored and humbled to be back in Nigeria. Okparanta\u2019s pictures are clear and beautiful. She has a way of relaying the old folk tales that make you a witness to the grandness and simplicity of Nigeria\u2019s finest and scariest elements. It\u2019s mesmerizing.\u201cThe saying goes that wood already touched by fire isn\u2019t hard to set alight.\u201d Aside from the tales are the sayings, each with special, driven-deep meaning.

Certainly, the characters are all Nigerian, and there are a few traditional tales told, over the course of the book - but the story itself is clearly based on true events, not on folktales. I was actually nearly convinced that this was a memoir, it rings so true. It's not, but the author has stated that some details are based on her mother's experiences in Nigeria. It feels like a family story.I'd be surprised if no one else has yet described the book as the \"Oranges are Not the Only Fruit\" for Nigeria. Like that book, it's a coming-of-age story; a personal, painful look at what it is like to first fall in love with another woman, in an environment where lesbians are treated harshly (in this book, even killed) and denounced by so-called Christianity.The book is written in a very accessible, deceptively simple style. it's emotionally moving - but you'll also come away from the book feeling like you've truly gained an insight as to what it was like to live in 1960-1970's Nigeria.

The book follows Ijeoma from youth through to adulthood and details all the prejudices that come with being LGBTQ in Nigeria. The story is filled with genuine emotion and I was frequently moved to tears by some of the horribleness of what happened to Ijeoma and to some of those around her. There are descriptions of bigotry, abusiveness and criminal behaviour that left me utterly chilled and filled with horror and sadness. It's the highest of praise for the themes covered within the book and shedding light on the current climate in Nigeria towards the LGBTQ community. But on the writing side of things I felt a little let down. I had heard this book mentioned in the same breath as the great Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie but, in my opinion, currently they are worlds apart.

The author\u2019s storytelling abilities are showcased as she seamlessly weaves together the coming-of-age stories of Nigeria and the main character, Ijeoma. This technique effectively put me into a specific time and place and yet is universally appealing. Ijeoma\u2019s young world is shattered as the civil war kills her father, and her mother sends her away to a safer place. In this new place Ijeoma, an Igbo and Amina, a Hausa, find comfort in their loving each other until caught and Ijeoma is reunited with her mother. Veiled bible lessons become the root of discomfort and confusion as Ijeoma tries to understand her cultural and societal expectations. When meeting Amina again in school their attraction solidifies until Amina marries. As Ijeoma meets another woman, Ndidi she learns the horrific consequences of same-sex relationships and eventually gives in to societal (and her mother\u2019s) pressure marrying a loving understanding man. Ijeoma struggles from the beginning to present the facade of being a wife and to find some degree of happiness and satisfaction until she reaches a point where this is no longer an option to her. The beautiful honest language handles the sensitive subjects with grace, bringing the inner thoughts of the characters to light in a manner that will make readers ache in their struggles. I had read Okparanta\u2019s short story collection, Happiness, Like Water, I was impressed with the fluidity of her writing and the how profound the stories were and knew that I would enjoy her future work.

But there were to be more changes. There is no way to tell the story of what happened with Amina without first telling the story of Mama's sending me off. Likewise there is no way to tell the story of Mama's sending me off without also telling of Papa's refusal to go to the bunker. Without his refusal, the sending away might never have occurred, and of the sending away had not occurred, them I might never have met Amina. If I had not met Amina, who knows, there might be no story at all to tell.So, the story begins even before the story, on June 23, 1968, Ubosi chi ji ehihe jie: the day the night fell in the afternoon, as the saying goesOn that date our narrator Ijeoma is in her early teens, her hometown in the secessionist state of Biafra, increasingly devastated by the Nigerian civil war, her previously bucolic life shattered by the ruckus of armored cars and shelling machines, bomber planes and their loud engines sending shock waves through our ears, and her upper-middle class family (her father an architect) now reduced to poverty.Her father, despairing of what has become of his family and his country, refuses to follow his family into the bunker during an air-raid, and is killed, and her bereaved mother sends her to live with some family friends, for whom Ijoema works as a housemaid while her mother attempts to rebuild their shattered lives. There Ijeoma encounters another girl, Amina, under an udala tree (the fruits of which are a symbol of female fertility): I wasn't far into my return when I felt a shadow following me, a shadow other than my own. It crossed the roads with me, hopped over the puddles with me. It appeared to tap the leaves with me, or at least it stood close behind me as I did. I stopped in order to allow the shadow to pass me. I found a large rock near where an udala tree stood and sat down there. I waited on the rock, hoping that he shadow would continue along, but it did not. Instead, it sat across from me, on another rock, eyes bright, like a pair of light bulbs. She was no longer a shadow. She had skin as light as mine. Yellow, like a ripe pawpaw. She wore a tattered green pinafore that was bare at the sides. Her hair hung in long clumps around her face, like those of the images of Mami Wata, hair writhing like serpents. But there were no serpents on her. She looked too dazed or disorientated, or simply too exhausted to speak. Someone had discarded udala seeds near where I sat, forming a tiny mound on the ground. Ants had paved themselves a path to the mound. I watched the ants for some time, the way they lined up, one after the other, the way they gathered in circles around the seeds. There were crushed leaves all around. The sun hovered above, watchful over us. We moved our plastic-slippered feet around the muddy earth. We looked down at the ground as we did, but I sneaked peaks at her, and I'm sure she did at me. A bird flew from the udala tree, its wings beating hard through the air. We tilted our heads and watched. Finally we gathered the courage to look into each other's faces. The moment our eyes locked, I knew I would not be leaving without her. Theirs is a relationship that offends various taboos. Ijeoma is a Christian Igbo and Amina a Muslim Hausa from the North, the other (winning) side in the civil war, but it is their same-sex relationship that causes the most offence. Okparanta's afterword references the 2014 Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act (see e.g. this report from the UK Daily Telegraph) and she statesThis novel attempts to give Nigeria's marginalised LGBTQ citizens a more powerful voice, and a place in our nation's history.In the same afterword, she observes that per a Win-Gallup survey, Nigerians self-identification makes them the 2nd most religious country of those surveyed all over the world. The conflict between religious belief and sexuality, particularly between the forgiveness inherent in Christianity and the moral standards, is key to the novel as Ijeoma's life progresses. At one point, praying in Church for clarity on what she should do, she realises all I felt within me was a trembling from this questionable sense of guilt. When she decides, reluctantly to get married and start a family she names her daughter Chidimna - for God is good - although her joy as a mother doesn't resolve her unhappiness with her husband.Okparanta herself comes from the same conflicted background and has said\"I was raised as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and when I became of age, I did my own research, and I made a conscious decision to continue as a Christian, though not as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness.\" https://iowareview.org/blog/religion-...Although set in Nigeria, arguably a rather extreme example, the same issues are no less topical in the West. In the current UK election, the leader of the most socially liberal party struggled to answer questions about how he reconciled his Christian beliefs with his party's views on LGBT issues.Okparanta's prose is the novel's highlight: it successfully blends the personal and glimpes of the wider conflict, the sentimental with the realities of life in a war-riven and illiberal country, unadorned prose with burst of lyricality, the techniques of modern US creative writing programs with Nigerian literature (Things Fall Apart and The Palm-Wine Drinkard are explicitly referenced) and oral folk tales.But her ultimate aim is to be affirmative and, while this may say more about my cynicism than any demerit of the book, some things were ultimately a little too smoothed over for my taste.The horrors of the conflict - dismembered bodies lie putrefying in the gutters - are treated as strikingly matter-of-fact: perhaps one could make a case that it successfully emphasises the horror of the war that such sights quickly become routine, but when later in the novel there are scenes of people stoned and burned alive for their sexuality this again didn't seen written to have the shocking impact on the reader (at least this reader) that it should.And Ijeoma's (and by inference the author's) resolution of the debate at the heart of the novel relies on a rather creative reading of Hebrews 8 on the New Covenant arguing that this it seems to me, is the lesson of the Bible: this affirmation of the importance of reflection, and of revision, enough revision to do away with tired, old, even faulty laws.Overall a beautifully written and thought provoking book, but ultimately rather unsatisfying."}, {"userName": "Clif Hostetler", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler", "userReview": "[She eventually leave the marriage (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Viv JM", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4243437-viv-jm", "userReview": "3.5 starsI had high expectations of this book and, although I liked it, I didn't love it. It begins at the time of the Biafran war in Nigeria, and the protagonist, Ijeoma, is coming of age as a young lesbian in a deeply religious society that shuns homosexuality. We follow her in coming to terms with who she is, and there is a generally hopeful and optimistic vibe about the book (especially the ending), despite the difficulties Ijeoma encounters along the way, both in her own family and in society as a whole. Bad things do happen in the book, but they seem in some ways to be at the periphery of Ijeoma's life and I think maybe that made it feel a little too naively optimistic for me, and that was what stopped me from liking the book more.I listened to the audiobook version, narrated by Robin Miles, and I thought she was excellent."}, {"userName": "Naz (Read Diverse Books)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5774287-naz-read-diverse-books", "userReview": "Full review in my blog: http://wp.me/p7a9pe-5d\u201cUnder the Udala Trees\u201d beautifully and boldly lends its voice to Nigeria\u2019s LGBT community, which is critically important if the country is ever going to make progress in LGBT rights."}, {"userName": "Candace White", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47449014-candace-white", "userReview": "Loved everything about this book!

In this context, the gay protagonist of Okparanta's novel, Ijeoma, must express her true sexuality in a clandestine manner, or risk losing her life. Told partly in the style of a folkloric narrative, with fables and biblical quotes blended into the text, the author tells an emotional coming-of-age story of love and the search for independence. Told against the backdrop of the Nigerian civil war in the late 60's, and on through Ijeoma's adulthood through the post-war 80s, the struggle for personal sovereignty and living an authentic life is at the heart of the tale.Ijeoma's and her parents live in a gated compound in Ojoto, in late 1960's Biafra, at the time that Biafra is a secessionist state in eastern Nigeria and is in the throes of the civil war. As a child, I remember being horrified and tearful at the sight of PSAs depicting starving children in Biafra suffering from malnutrition. Ijeoma's father dies when she is only eleven, provoked by despair. Mother and child go from privileged to poor, barely surviving the losses. Ijeoma's mother is comforted by the Bible, whereas Ijeoma is even more drawn to the folk tales and fables her father used to tell her.Her mother sends her off to Nnewi to live with a grammar school teacher and his wife, promising to come collect her once she resettles, \"maybe just a few days.\" To a girl of eleven, it felt like abandonment. \"In a warped, war-induced sort of way, it made sense that she should...shed us all: the soldiers, me, and the house. To shed, if she could have, all memories of the war. To shed, and shed, and shed. Like an animal casting off old hair or skin. A lizard. A snake. A cat or a dog... ...To shed us all like a bad habit.\" A motif of the story--to shed--is used in several ways, not just the shedding of war, but also of the old traditions.Ijeoma is left in Nnewi for two years, a trying time that is relieved by her new friend, Amina. Ijeoma is Igbo, and Amina is Hausa, which made no difference to the two girls, much to the chagrin of the adults, but soon the grammar school teacher and his wife accept Amina into their home. Over time, the girls form a special bond, as friends, and then toward a forbidden, same-sex love. When they are caught, Ijeoma is finally sent back to reunite with her mother, who is determined to purge her daughter's sexual orientation with biblical intervention.Told in a non-linear narrative, the story contrasts the mother's strident, impassioned biblical teachings and Ijeoma's recognition of her own desires. Her mother wants to rid Ijeoma of her \"abominations,\" a word that becomes ingrained in Ijeoma's mind, influencing her decisions, weakening her resolve. Yet, the bible does not console her; in fact, it leads her to question the meaning of the stories and allegories. For example, how can Lot offer his daughters up to other men to do what they want with them, just to prevent \"man lying with man\"? But, Ijeoma's mother clings to the adherence of a cruel persecution of a minority population (homosexuals), despite being persecuted herself during the war, as her family and home were shattered by defeat. She doesn't recognize her cognitive dissonance, so limited is she by a harsh, rigid belief.As the story progresses with a compassionate and vital energy, the reader is taken on a courageous journey of a woman who is fighting for love, family, personal justice, and a sense of inner peace. Okparanta, in this touching novel, gives voice to the many Nigerians who have been forced to go into hiding. She speaks up for love, in different forms.\"Yes, it had been Adam and Eve...Why did that have to exclude the possibility of a certain Adam and Adam or a certain Eve and Eve?...Woman was created for man, yes. Did that mean that woman could not also have been created for another woman? Or man for another man?...So why should other stories in the Bible\" (referring to allegories) \"not be conducive to allegorical treatment as well?\""}, {"userName": "Arielle Walker", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6762949-arielle-walker", "userReview": "\"Sometimes a decision comes upon us in that way - in a series of dreams, in a series of small epiphanies.\"In a quote on the back cover of this book, Helon Habila says \"Under the Udala Trees has all of the ingredients of a great novel: set against the backdrop of war, it tells a story of loss, forbidden love, and one woman's fight against tradition... This is a brave and timely achievement.\"This statement is, without a doubt, wholeheartedly true. My only criticism is that these ingredients never quite come together, and at times the novel becomes disjointed, losing much of its power. But oh, when it flies it soars.Ijeoma is an incredible character. Sympathetic without being weak, her strength through the story makes those moments where she does falter and doubt all the more heart-wrenching. The writing itself is gentle, giving Ijeoma a soft, descriptive voice, almost matter of fact. Deceptively so, for it lets the horrors of violence creep up on you, just out of sight, on the sidelines until the moments where you are slapped in the face by the rawness and cruelty it all. Of the consequences for daring to make a stand, whether it be bold, declaring your people free and separate in Biafra; or quiet, holding the hand of the one you are not allowed to love.This gentle, repetitive language, though at times exceptionally beautiful, can move a little too slowly. Passages such as this - but far longer - are common: \"It was a small enclave of a school, hemmed in by bushes and trees, mostly plantain and palm trees. The only road clear of the bushes and trees was the road one took to get to the school. It was a muddy and potholed road at the tip of which was a gate that led into the school compound.\" However, once the scenic descriptions are done, Okparanta gives u relationships and these moments are where she really shines. Amina is a catalytic character, of course, but it was Ndidi who stole my heart and I wish that a little more time could have been spent on that part of Ijeoma's life, rather than on descriptions of pathways. Still, a minor quibble in the scheme of things. This is a first novel from a beautiful new voice, a voice I most definitely want to read from again."}, {"userName": "Bookishrealm", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm", "userReview": "Update 2/8/18: Here's my full review! http://www.bookishrealmreviews.com/20...First let me say that I actually picked his book up on a whim.

Sent away to safety, she meets another displaced child and they, star-crossed, fall in love. They are from different ethnic communities. They are also both girls. When their love is discovered, Ijeoma learns that she will have to hide this part of herself. But there is a cost to living inside a lie. As Edwidge Danticat has made personal the legacy of Haiti's political coming of age, Okparanta's Under the Udala Trees uses one woman's lifetime to examine the ways in which Nigerians continue to struggle toward selfhood. Even as their nation contends with and recovers from the effects of war and division, Nigerian lives are also wrecked and lost from taboo and prejudice. This story offers a glimmer of hope \u2014 a future where a woman might just be able to shape her life around truth and love.", "title": "Under the Udala Trees", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1527183893l/40205036.jpg", "reviews": 673, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6464662.Chinelo_Okparanta", "name": "Chinelo Okparanta"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural", "Lgbt", "Glbt"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15814530-happiness-like-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26247923-benji", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35693674-litmag", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29389042-blackass-excerpt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34146421-granta-139"]}
