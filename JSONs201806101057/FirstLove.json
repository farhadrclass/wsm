Seriously, James?? OK, I can almost forgive the complete and total ripoff of Fault in our Stars, as I am sure we will be seeing a lot of those in the upcoming months, but, that aside, the utter implausibility of this book made me slightly insane. To begin...this entire whirlwind adventure took place in three weeks. The drove from Oregon to California, California to Vegas, Vegas to wherever the hell they were when they stopped in a hospital for a couple of days, hospital to New York, New York to Philly and, finally, Philly to some undisclosed location in the Carolinas. Right. Three weeks. With plenty of time to stop and camp in the Redwoods, explore Hollywood, hook up with a stripper in Vegas, land in the hospital...you know what, I can't even finish. But, let us not forget that at the end of three weeks...one of them is dead!!! Another rather glaring plot point...holding up a state trooper at gun point?? Roughly two weeks before you are so weak you are dead?? You managed to turn his gun on him and lock him up in his trunk?? I can't.The hospital trip. We are really expected to believe two minors can stroll on into a hospital, one of them clearly dying of cancer and they just take the in, no questions asked. Nobody is worried about insurance, parents, payment. And, clearly, this is the most ridiculous hospital in the worl...since you can just sneak out of ICU without anyone knowing. Fantastic.Then, the 1,440 mile journey in a broken down truck seemed to happen overnight...no need for stops or anything. We just knocked that out in a night. $1500 also managed to cover the cost for this entire trip. Apparently, gas is free in stolen vehicles. Again, fantastic.Then the very dramatic death. It read like a lot of time was passing. Nope, turned out to just be a couple of days. We went from holding up a cop at gun point to death in like 10 days. I get that cancer moves fast, but...seriously?? Then, the brat, I'm sorry...heroine?? Finally returns home and rather nobly turns herself into the police. And then has to go into remedial Physics because skipping three weeks of classes when you are at an AP level apparently just renders you completely stupid. I truly thought this book was just awful. It was hard to root for whatever their names were because they were kind of just spoiled brats. I expect we are meant to feel bad for them since they both had cancer. I'm sorry, but I don't think that excuses a crime spree as they be-bop their way across America. Honestly, I hope she ends up stuck in that town forever.

As someone who loves reading road trip novels, this sounded like my cup of tea. But after starting the book, I was finding the pacing incredibly fast which made the trip a little unrealistic in my view. I put the book down for a while (talking few months) and returned to it recently to see if I could get any further through but again, I struggled and simply concluded that I had lost interest. Overall, I was disappointed.The story followed two characters called Axi and Robinson. Axi had a tough upbringing and she's secretly hidden a crush on Robinson from him for a while. She plans to reveal all on their road trip together. The story follows the road trip and the events that occur including stealing a motorbike. I still love road trip novels though, my reading experience from them wasn't vanished because of this book so if you know any good road trip novels, feel free to recommend some.

First, I\u2019ve seen it compared to the The Fault in Our Stars many times and second, there was a road trip in the story. Putting these two elements together, I was sure First Love would capture my interest.In this novel, Axi Moore and her best friend Robinson decide to throw caution to the wind and take an epic road trip while time is still on their side. This decision is huge because everyone knows that Axi is the straight and narrow girl who gets good grades and always does what is expected of her. Her best friend Robinson is the charming boy who can get away with murder and charm the pants off of anyone. As they make their plans and travel from the west to east coast, we get to experience Axi and Robinson\u2019s love unfold along with the reasons that brought them together. There were a few things that seemed a bit choppy with this story. I was surprised the author didn\u2019t bother to make the story more believable when it came to the road trip and Robinson\u2019s condition. I find it hard to believe that two teenagers can do so much in three weeks on such limited funds, as well as committing a few crimes along the way. What also caught me off guard was the sudden and drastic decline of Robinson\u2019s condition. If this novel were a bit longer and better developed, I think their story would have been more plausible and believable.Overall, this was a quick and heartfelt story despite its flaws. I\u2019m always a sucker for dramatic endings and romance, so it wasn\u2019t too bad\u2026 just could have been so much better."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Axi Moore had a big surprise for her best friend. Robinson was one she never seemed to be able to shock, but this time she hoped she could. Cutting classes for the afternoon, she had arranged to meet him at Bernie\u2019s, their favourite hang-out, at 1.30 \u2013 when he walked in the door his big smile said it all. But she finally did it \u2013 when she told him her plans, and that he was part of it, she waited for his answer; \u201chell yes\u201d was all the answer she needed.Axi was GG to Robinson \u2013 Good Girl, he called her. But she wanted to put a dent in that title. With her little sister, Carole Ann, dying young, her mother deserting her and father taking to the drink to drown his grief, she wanted to flee \u2013 the road trip across the country to see things she\u2019d only read about in her precious books was going to be her way of grieving. Robinson would make it so much better - her nickname for him was Scalawag; he lived up to it daily with a mischievous smile to add to the tag.And so their journey began \u2013 before dawn one morning she snuck out of her apartment, leaving her dad asleep on the couch, and met Robinson near the bus depot. But they didn\u2019t take the bus \u2013 the journey of a lifetime didn\u2019t begin on a Greyhound bus said Robinson. As they roared off into the distance the exhilaration and excitement took Axi\u2019s breathe away. It had begun\u2026And so the two of them journeyed across the US, stopping here, camping there, sledding on sand dunes, using fake ID (they failed each time), eating Slim Jims (Robinson) and limp salad (Axi) to their heart\u2019s content. They visited the Big Apple, LA, Detroit and everywhere in between. And all the time, Axi was trying to find the right time to declare her love for Robinson\u2026 And the future they didn\u2019t want was edging closer\u2026What a wonderful, sad, emotional and amazing story! It is a hugely difficult review to write as it would be sooo easy to give away spoilers. But the characters of sixteen year old Axi and seventeen year old Robinson are absolutely real. They form the basis of this story, they ARE the story, with many \u201calong the way\u201d characters who interweave throughout. The writing is beautiful \u2013 extremely poignant and moving.

Anyway, he wrote \"First Love\" with Emily Raymond. (But look at the typeface of both their names, and you can see who is marketed more) Maybe that's why this book is kind of a mess: it's muddled, unfocused and kind of dumb. Yes, I know it is about teenagers, and they may be the target market, but I thought the book felt dumbed-down. And I wish the characters were more likeable. Halfway through the book, I stopped caring about the characters even if the authors manipulate you into liking them. I cannot help but think that the book is a poor copy of John Green's \"The Fault In Our Stars,\" so if you haven't read that yet, go grab that book instead because this one more or less tread the same road, and Green's book is infinitely better. http://luhathoughts.blogspot.com/2014..."}, {"userName": "Libby Ames", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016770-libby-ames", "userReview": "First Love really felt like a much inferior version of The Fault in Our Stars. Really if you want to depress yourself by reading about young love and dying at least read John Green's poetic description and character building. I'm afraid James Patterson doesn't come close and he gives no moral uplift to couter the tragedy. Young love and living life to its fullest is great in theory, but a spontaneous cross country trip can still be exciting without breaking laws. I don't care who is dying, stealing cars and joy riding should not be glorified.

Il tema era #Unlibroterrificante e una lettrice ha postato questo, dicendo che c'\u00e8 un segreto che esplode all'improvviso alla fine del libro e lascia il lettore in una valle di lacrime. Quindi questo libro era decisamente una delle letture che cercavo! Non ci ho pensato due volte e l'ho preso nell'ipermercato in cui lo vedevo sempre. Tutta contenta, ho iniziato a leggerlo...E mi sono ritrovata davanti qualcosa di diverso da quello che mi aspettavo.Se in un primo momento l'et\u00e0 dei protagonisti mi ha fatto storcere il naso (16 e 17 anni), poi mi sono detta: \u00abMa s\u00ec, dai, due pischelli, ci pu\u00f2 stare, non \u00e8 una tragedia\u00bb. Cio\u00e8, un po' lo era, visto che mi aspettavo LA TRAGEDIA e l'idea che ad affrontarla fossero due ragazzini... be', non era delle pi\u00f9 entusiasmanti.Posso essere onesta? Non \u00e8 che il libro mi sia piaciuto parecchio :/ Ammetto senza problemi di aver sfogliato e sfogliato, perch\u00e9 prima di tutto non sono stata minimamente rapita dalla scrittura. L'ho sentita parecchio distante, non mi ha fatto entrare in contatto con i personaggi. Avrei voluto che fosse un po' pi\u00f9 poetica, passatemi il termine, perch\u00e9 quando narri questo tipo di storie devi saper dire certe cose in modo... come posso dire... diverso. Invece era tutto molto... scolastico, diciamo. Il secondo motivo \u00e8 stato il fatto che non me ne fregasse assolutamente nulla delle tappe del loro viaggio on the road.Mi interessavano Axi e Robinson.Fine.Ma ho avuto ci\u00f2 che volevo solo al termine del romanzo, quando i sentimenti sono esplosi dalle pagine e, sbam!, mi hanno schiaffeggiato senza piet\u00e0. HO SENTITO TUTTO. Probabilmente ho percepito le ultime pagine in modo cos\u00ec forte perch\u00e9 so bene come sono quei momenti nella realt\u00e0, ma \u00e8 questo il bello dei libri, ritrovarsi in essi, anche in una sola scena. \u00c8 stato allora che ho rivalutato l'intero romanzo, perch\u00e9 ho compreso la ragione dello stile di scrittura poco emozionale e pi\u00f9 adolescenziale.Vorrei che Axi fosse reale, e forse lo \u00e8. Vorrei incontrarla per dirle che lo ha fatto bene \u2013 non benissimo, ma non importa assolutamente nulla. Vorrei dirle che \u00e8 riuscita a farmi commuovere e che non \u00e8 cosa da poco, per me. Vuol dire che mi ha dato qualcosa che in pochi sanno fare, perch\u00e9 io non sono una che piange quando legge.Vorrei dire a Robinson che confermo, ci ha messo dentro un sacco di parole che neppure io ho capito (LOL!) e una valanga di metafore strampalate e roba simile. Vorrei dirgli che io non so come avrei reagito e forse lo avrei deluso. O forse avrei accettato anch'io, non lo so. Sicuramente avrei agito come lui.Vorrei dirgli che, ma s\u00ec, scappiamo e vediamo come va a finire.L'importante \u00e8 stare con la persona che amiamo.\n\u00abMi manchi gi\u00e0\u00bb, disse sottovoce Robinson.\u00abSono qui\u00bb, sussurrai. \u00abCi sar\u00f2 sempre.\u00bb\u00abMa io no.\u00bb\u2724 Leggi la recensione sul blog \u2724\u2605 \nACQUISTA ORA CON 1-CLICK\n \u2605|| Facebook || Twitter || Pinterest ||"}, {"userName": "Irene Rauch", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50953890-irene-rauch", "userReview": "Das Buch hat mir super gefallen!

I didn't cry. I didn't feel any emotion when Robinson died. Everything was annoying to me.2. Annoying things: the characters trying to sound smart but then explaining the vocabulary words or book references which made the reader feel annoyed because it assumes that the reader doesn't know anything. The use of the words gobsmacked and scalawag too many times. The lack of emotion I felt for anything in this book. That Robinson left his family for Axi and never did anything about it until the road trip. Who leaves an amazing family behind when they have cancer? That Axi turned herself in. It was just stupid. How the frick could two minors go into a hospital without ID, insurance, parents. And also there's no way the amount of money they had could have covered the trip. That basically this was a knock off of The Fault in Our Stars.3. Things in common with The Fault in Our Stars: they both have cancer. The characters are sort of quippy and sarcastic. They make references to the stars. They have a big adventure that helps them with their love story and find themselves. There's a sex scene. The boy dies.4. The only reason I kept reading was to find out how it ended. If this wasn't a library book I probably would have ripped the pages out one by one, shredded them, and not composted them. Because this book wasn't even worthy of helping make good dirt. I would have thrown the shreds away, let it go to a landfill, and hoped that it landed by poopy toilet paper or a used diaper.5.

So, this wasn't too bad for my very first James Patterson book. I really like the way he delivered this book and he made this so realistic and relatable. When you learn by the halfway point once one of them (won't say who) coughs up blood, then you learn how the two met etc, that's when Patterson goes on this journey that I guess was a real eye opener for me in such a way. There's a quote that says, \"Life is to be ENJOYED and not just to be endured\" and it's so true. I have bad days, I have good days, I have heartbreaks/heartache's, I have days where I feel alone, worthless, why am I here, WHY should I just go on? but then I feel and remember God's love and His presence there saying, \"don't give up. Just do the best you can and you'll be okay.\" and also telling and reminding me I'M NEVER ALONE! I have friends and family around and Him too. We all know CANCER SUCKS!! I had an aunt (my dad's sister in law) have breast cancer years back and kicked it's butt and has 3 big adorable boys: the 2 older ones are twins and then a single one, but now one twin and the single are both autistic. What's amazing though is she's still alive because she lost her mom to breast cancer at the same age she was when she beat it and luckily my aunt lived. I believe her purpose was to be here and take care of her boys. I haven't seen her or my uncle in years but seeing her Instagram and posts of her boys are amazing. My uncle like most in my dads family are \"messed up\" only my uncle had a drug problem after his mission years ago and pornography addiction and ended up cleaning up his life. He did struggle of course in his marriage when they had the twins but what's amazing is they've tried to work it out for years now. So I'm so glad the breast cancer didn't take her in case my uncle one day isn't able to take care of his kids especially two autistic boys. So definite miracle there. However, I had a great uncle die (mom's uncle) from a brain tumor a few years back and only lived for a few months. His youngest (he and his wife has 8 boys no girls) was about 25, 26....so yeah. pretty young to lose your parent but it was definitely hard for me too because he was one of my favorites and one great uncle I knew pretty well. But he truly lived life to the fullest especially with 8 boys and no daughters! But he did have a lot of granddaughters though. one thing I learn with this is ENJOY the time you may have left even if you live or not just enjoy it while you can, have fun, don't worry about death and take it when it come, and also know you're not alone, or if you're the recipient and having to watch a friend or loved one go through that, know you're also not alone. You have friends and family with you. Enjoy the time you have left with those who do have cancer or some illness or like my 89 year old grandpa (as of 2017 :)) who has lived longer than the men in his family do (most die early 60s-early 70s), I try and spend as much time with him and my now almost 84 year old grandma as I can. I never know when their last will be but I know that I'll have many great more memories with them. Just like Axi and Robinson in this book, they made a TON of new memories and had each other, not just friendship but love as well and I seriously LOVED this book actually on so many levels. But overall, I loved the message and the journey Axi and Robinson go through and eventually admit they love each other and will always hold onto that for as long as it takes. so well written and loved the story. it's a fast read and short chapters (my favorite) and just so heartwarming and moving. highly recommend this book and if you haven't read this yet, put it on your tbr list and try to read it when you can. It's worth it that's for sure!

The familiar good girl with a crush on her best friend that could charm an angry wasp with a crooked smile. Then somewhere around page 100 it became something else, sort of outlandish and Bonnie & Clyde. Then suddenly it was 'The Fault in Our Stars'. And even though you knew how it would end, it still gets you to sob at the end. Not what I initially expected. I think because the cover is kind of lame. I hope the paperback has a better cover so that it appeals to more people, although the fact that James Patterson wrote it is kind of a given. :)"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10536574-jen", "userReview": "This was a very sad book about teens who go on a journey together after meeting in a hospital. I won't tell you how they met but I will say that it was love at first sight and they go across the country to escape their life. In the end they find that they can't escape life but they can be together and learn life lessons together. This was such a heart warming story about true love and how you find the one you're meant to be with in strange ways and it is always worth it. This was not a normal James Patterson book by any means.

Da una cover che sprizzava giovinezza da tutti i pori, da una trama che per una volta (e potrei gridare al miracolo), non spoilera niente sulla storia, e che anzi, ti fa credere di avere tra le mani uno YA bello e buono, e se devo dire la verit\u00e0, che non brilla di tutta questa originalit\u00e0.

Es war wie Liebe auf den ersten Blick, zumindest von meiner Seite aus. Ich muss allerdings gestehen, dass ich nicht allzu viel von der Geschichte erwartet habe, weil ich der Auffassung war, dass dies eine Roadtrip-Geschichte ist, die durch ein bisschen Romantik und viel Spa\u00df den Leser gut unterh\u00e4lt, aber ihm nicht unbedingt in Erinnerung bleibt. Ich habe aber \u00fcberhaupt nicht damit gerechnet, dass diese Geschichte so viel mehr als das ist.Diese Geschichte ist eine Hommage an das Leben, an die erste gro\u00dfe Liebe, an das Gl\u00fcck zu jemandem zu geh\u00f6ren, an die Musik und an die Literatur.Die beiden Autoren haben es geschafft mich mit ihrer Geschichte zum Lachen, aber auch zum Weinen zu bringen und vor allem haben sie es geschafft, dass mir diese Geschichte noch lange Zeit in Erinnerung bleiben wird. Ich war sehr lange nicht mehr so ber\u00fchrt und dadurch auch begeistert von einer Geschichte. Ich kann sie euch allen wirklich nur ans Herz legen, weil sie so viel mehr ist, als sie zu sein scheint. Die CharaktereDie Autoren haben es geschafft eine Geschichte zu schreiben, die eigentlich nur durch die beiden Protagonisten lebt. Ich wei\u00df, dass es nicht einfach ist eine Geschichte zu schreiben, die so gut wie gar keine Nebencharaktere hat, da die Gefahr besteht den Leser mit wenigen Charakteren zu langweilen. Allerdings ist das bei diesem Buch \u00fcberhaupt nicht der Fall.Die Autoren habe es geschafft Axi und Robinson so viel Leben und Seele einzuhauchen, dass sie vollkommen realistisch wirken und man sich als Leser sofort mit ihnen identifizieren kann. Ich habe selten so vielschichtige Charaktere kennenlernen d\u00fcrfen wie diese beiden, denn sie sind ganz anders, als sie im ersten Moment wirken. Die beiden haben n\u00e4mlich mindestens genauso viel Tiefe wie die Geschichte selbst.Axi lernt man am besten kennen von den beiden, da die Geschichte aus ihrer Sicht erz\u00e4hlt wird. Sie ist ein braves M\u00e4dchen, eine sehr gute Sch\u00fclerin und w\u00fcrde niemals etwas verbotenes tun. Jedenfalls bis zu dem Tag, als sie beschlie\u00dft aus ihrem traurigen Leben zu verschwinden und mit Robinson (ihrem besten Freund und gleichzeitig ihrer ersten gro\u00dfen Liebe) einen Roadtrip durch die USA zu machen. Von diesem Zeitpunkt an, macht sie eine riesige Verwandlung durch und zwar im positiven Sinn. Sie wird abenteuerlustig und ist irgendwann definitiv kein braves M\u00e4dchen mehr, aber daf\u00fcr ist sie endlich mal in ihrem Leben gl\u00fccklich. Robinson ist das totale Gegenteil von Axi (jedenfalls am Anfang der Geschichte). Er ist abenteuerlustig, spontan und manchmal auf die beste Art und Weise unberechenbar. Er ist definitiv der beste Freund, den man sich vorstellen kann und ich h\u00e4tte mich an Axis Stelle auch in ihn verliebt.Der SchreibstilIch wei\u00df zwar nicht wie die beiden Autoren das mit dem Schreiben geregelt haben, aber der Schreibstil ist auf seine ganz eigene Art und Weise perfekt und wirkt auch immer gleich auf mich. Die Geschichte wird aus der personalen Ich-Perspektive von Axi erz\u00e4hlt, sodass man als Leser ihre ganzen Gedanken und auch Gef\u00fchle aus erster Hand erf\u00e4hrt und sie somit viel besser kennenlernt als Robinson. Ich mochte Axi vom ersten Augenblick an total gerne und habe mich deswegen auch sehr gefreut, dass sie die Geschichte der beiden erz\u00e4hlt. Allerdings habe ich mir trotzdem manchmal gew\u00fcnscht, dass auch mal Robinson ein Kapitel aus seiner Sicht erz\u00e4hlt, da ich ihn gerne noch ein bisschen besser kennengelernt h\u00e4tte, aber das ist wirklich meckern auf h\u00f6chstem Niveau.Der Schreibstil ist humorvoll, wundersch\u00f6n, romantisch, aber vor allem auch ber\u00fchrend. Er transportiert unglaublich viele Emotionen und l\u00e4sst den Leser f\u00fchlen.Ich kann mir keinen besseren Schreibstil f\u00fcr diese Geschichte vorstellen.Die GestaltungIch habe selten ein Buch gesehen, das mit so viel Liebe gestaltet wurde. Hier ist es eben nicht nur das wundersch\u00f6ne Cover oder der ganz besondere Titel, das bzw. der mich begeistert hat, sondern vor allem die Gestaltung von innen. In diesem Buch sind n\u00e4mlich \u00fcberall Bilder abgedruckt, die gerade zu dem Ort passen, wo Axi und Robinson gerade sind. Manchmal sind es Bilder von Landschaften, bestimmten Dingen, die in der Geschichte eine Rolle spielen, aber manchmal sind es auch Bilder von Axi und Robinson selbst, sodass man sich die beiden noch viel besser vorstellen kann. Durch diese abgedruckten Bilder wird die Geschichte noch viel lebendiger und man hat als Leser wirklich das Gef\u00fchl, als sei man mit Axi und Robinson zusammen auf diesem Roadtrip und w\u00fcrde alles hautnah erleben, was sie auch erleben. Ich habe noch nie ein Buch gesehen, das mit so viel Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die Geschichte gestaltet wurde. Mein Fazit\"Heart. Beat. Love.\" von James Patterson und Emily Raymond ist ein unglaublich ber\u00fchrendes Buch, das den Leser mit Tiefgang und wahren Emotionen begeistert und auch \u00fcberrascht. Es ist so viel mehr als nur ein Buch \u00fcber einen Roadtrip. Dieses Buch ist eine Hommage an das Leben, die erste gro\u00dfe Liebe, an das Gl\u00fcck zu jemandem zu geh\u00f6ren, an die Musik, an die Literatur und an die Freiheit."}], "description": "An extraordinary portrait of true love that will move anyone who has a first love story of their own. Axi Moore is a \"good girl\": She studies hard, stays out of the spotlight, and doesn't tell anyone how all she really wants is to run away from it all. The only person she can tell is her best friend, Robinson--who she also happens to be madly in love with. When Axi spontaneously invites Robinson to come with her on an impulsive cross-country road trip, she breaks the rules for the first time in her life. But the adventure quickly turns from carefree to out of control after the teens find themselves on the run from the police. And when Robinson suddenly collapses, Axi has to face the truth that this trip might be his last.A remarkably moving tale very personal to James Patterson's own past, FIRST LOVE is testament to the power of first love--and how it can change the rest of your life.", "title": "First Love", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17899392-first-love", "average": 3.77, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408925704l/17899392.jpg", "reviews": 1857, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3780.James_Patterson", "name": "James Patterson"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6046872.Emily_Raymond", "name": "Emily Raymond"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Young Adult", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17899392-first-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17899371-first-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20555651-first-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18278113-first-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26024657-first-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31361561-il-nostro-amore-per-sempre", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25196370-heart-beat-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23717510-heart-beat-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25068420-prvn-l-ska", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20555359-primeiro-amor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22064414-il-nostro-amore-per-sempre", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28939782-first-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13145.Along_Came_a_Spider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13148.Kiss_the_Girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13137.1st_to_Die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13152.The_Angel_Experiment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7494.Suzanne_s_Diary_for_Nicholas"]}
