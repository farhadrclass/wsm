So I did both.The novel tells the tale of failed lawyer turned bookstore widget Thomas, who finds his soulmates in an eccentric group of fellow employees at hypermegabookstore READ. The only problem is they're more crazy than eccentric. They hold secret meetings where they burn offensive books -- you know, Michael Crichton, Candace Bushnell, the Left Behind series -- while assuming the monikers of beloved fictional characters. Oh, Corey, you had me at Yossarian. They have a particular hatred for a book club host called Munroe Purvis, who's sort of a sordid cross between Oprah and Morton Downey Jr. and whose book club selections represent everything wrong with western society -- imagine your grandmother's diaries turned into bestsellers, and you'll have an idea of what Purvis's book club represents.Of course, Purvis isn't what he appears to be, and neither are many of Thomas's bookstore friends. Some of them turn out to be hiding deep secrets about the bookstore, while others are just plain dangerous in the way only geeks can be dangerous. When Purvis goes on tour and comes to town, the secrets and craziness collide as Thomas's friends set out to destroy Purvis, and the novel quickly moves from the Nick Hornby section of the bookstore to the Joseph Heller and Chuck Palahniuk table.Redekop manages to keep his own voice throughout the novel, while winking, nodding and even raising a beer every now and then to literary culture. He name-drops authors more than a fourth-year English student, and he makes some literary traditions his own, such as adopting the epistolary novel and turning it into an email exchange while Thomas is on the run from the authorities. Even this is a bit of a literary joke for Redekop, though, as the recipient of his emails is Eric McCormack, a real-life Canadian author. At least I think he's a real-life Canadian author. I've never met him, and after reading Shelf Monkey I am beginning to wonder if he's a clever construct on the part of Redekop to flesh out the book.Shelf Monkey is a literary thriller but it's also a fun romp -- unless, presumably, you're an Oprah fan. But if so, you're not Redekop's imagined audience. His ideal reader knows this book is blackly, blackly funny because it's all too true.Full disclosure: Redekop gave one of my novels a fine review at his site, but I would have liked this book just as much anyway."}, {"userName": "Erin L", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3217959-erin-l", "userReview": "I finished this book last night and then let myself think about it awhile before posting my review. At first I was appalled by this book. Book burning? BOOK BURNING!?!?!?!!! You can't... I mean... No... Didn't we learn anything from Fahrenheit 451? Book burning is bad.But it was being done by people who proclaimed a love for books and literature. Shouldn't they know better?Most of a day later and I see that it is less about the books and more about people and the lengths we'll go to prove a point. That said, I also find myself questioning whether or not the meaning I got out of this book is the meaning I was really supposed to get out of the book. What if I'm wrong? Will a Shelf Monkey look at my Read list and scoff at the books they find there? Does my love of bestsellers and contemporary fiction overshadow the fact that I've never even picked up a book written by Stephanie Meyer?Does all of that leave my review null and void?All kidding aside, it was an interesting novel for me to read. I love books and while I can be a book snob at times, I've also read my fair share of pure and utter guilty-pleasure crap. But does the value in the book come from themes, meaning and all of the higher concepts? Or is there value in a story that exists to simply be a good, entertaining story?While I think the characters in the book were messed up, I think the author wrote them very well. I didn't need to get all of the literary references to understand the book. They actually contributed more in the way of characterization than they did plot - for me. So while I'm thinking, \"geez, you could've done this without all of the literary references,\" I also realize that that is who Thomas WAS. That's how he thought and interacted with the people around him. And at the end of the day all of that knowledge and biblio-superiority ended up being the downfall of all of them."}, {"userName": "Shanil", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3822851-shanil", "userReview": "So I'm 90% done and enough to give 4 stars...

This one might be the hardest.I kind of hated the first half of this book. Like, really hated it. Around page 50, I was this close to DNFing this mofo. But I was so close to my year end reading goals, and it wasn't a super long book, so I pushed on through, with mixed results. Thomas is such a turd, for starters. I am not saying he is an unlikable character, because unlikable characters don't generally turn me off on their own. He is just kind of... there. I am not sure what made him so boring for me, as the author made efforts to give this guy some dimension - he's got a slew of mental health issues, his life has been disrupted by his abandoning a difficult career path that he has been pushing through for years (and hey, who seriously quits halfway through articling, after getting an undergrad degree and then slogging through law school - seven or eight years of school, with law school being very time consuming and demanding and difficult - and you give up halfway through articling? I know a fair few people who have gone through this process and it seems bizarre to me), he's got this love interest, his relationship with whom is in constant flux and confusion... I get that Thomas is supposed to be a bit boring, that antihero who is not supposed to excite us. He points out, if I recall correctly, that he is like Nick Carraway and Aubrey is like Jay Gatsby, and guess what? I didn't like the Great Gatsby either, and I also thought Nick was a dweeb and boring as hell. Thomas' love interest, Danae, is such a disappointment. Ah, she walks in, all curves and dark hair and mystery, and Thomas has an instaboner for her. But that's all she is. Danae proves over and over again that she serves no purpose but to be a sexual object - indeed her main role in the climax is to be a seductress - and for some reason Thomas is somehow mystified and confused by her, even though she has no personality and is the token sex appeal. I was utterly bored by their dynamic, and disappointed in Corey Redekop for his inability to write interesting women. Other women are only seen briefly, with the next significant woman being Paige, the manager of the book store, who falls into the cliche of the bitchy woman boss that nobody likes because she is the bitchy boss. WHERE ARE THE INTERESTING WOMEN? Where are the interesting characters at all? Aubrey is supposed to be this novel's Gatsby, he is this novel's Tyler Durden, and yet he is a grey slate. In fact, the only character whom I found interesting was probably Munroe Purvis, for once his mask is revealed, he is a much more complex and interesting character than any of the others.I mentioned Tyler Durden. Let's talk about this book burning club. This is Fight Club for intellectuals (and Canadians, apparently - I did enjoy the repeated reminder that this takes place in Winnepeg, Manitoba, arguably the ONLY place in Canada more forgettable than us tiny provinces over in the maritimes, and possibly one of the least remarkable places in the world - this added something to the atmosphere of the novel), where instead of angry young men starting a revolution by fighting each other, the angry young nerds (who weren't invited to join Fight Club because they were too busy reading) get to argue and vent about everything wrong with the world via literature, and burn books as a way to find some sort of resolution. In theory, I love this idea. Not the burning books, which I am generally against, but this literary Fight Club. But, as I said, I don't find the characters of this book at all compelling, and Aubrey (literary Tyler) is no exception, and therefore his club is not compelling. Thomas, as this Fight Club's Jack the Narrator, is feeble in his distress and half hearted \"hey guys? Guys? This is going to far, eh?\" Danae as this novel's Marla is flat and cliche. But let's get to the climax of the book. Spoilers ahead. So they kidnap Munroe. They have a bizarre ritual where Thomas acts as his attorney, and then they torture the shit out of him. Everything from Munroe's kidnap forward, I was finally engaging with (except for Thomas, nothing was helping that guy in my eyes) this book, and I absolutely couldn't put it down! What? Where did this sudden entertainment come from?! Even as I was reading, thinking to myself how much I did not care for Thomas or how disappointing and uninteresting Danae was, I was still eager to keep going and see what was going to happen!I love that Thomas was caught in a bookstore, using books as his body armor. Amazing and hilarious. Finally, some of the dark humour of the book struck a cord with me. And when I finished, I was satisfied with the ending, somehow. That surprised me.Last bone to pick: I hated that this book was epistolary. I did not think it worked for this narrative. I hated that Thomas told his stories in emails. I would have much preferred a normal narrative, with the author still including newspaper clippings and other supplementary documents in addition to the narrative. And I'm a fan of epistolary novels, so don't think I just don't like that format.So, you know, I am really confused about how I feel about this book. I really liked certain parts of it, but it took me like 200 pages of hating just about everything to finally get to the good bit. 2 to 2.5 stars, but as this is goodreads, I will settle on 2. \"It was okay.\""}, {"userName": "Daniel Kukwa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3885089-daniel-kukwa", "userReview": "I'm very ambivalent about this novel. On the one hand, it's very much a black comedy, heavy on the black, with several laugh out loud moments, and an interesting message about the snobbery and elitism that exists among the bullied. However, it hurtles down a very uncomfortable & disturbing path in its final act, and I feel some of the message is buried under the extreme actions presented in the pseudo-Wicker Man finale. The humour is also trying very hard for an extra-dark Douglas Coupland-ish style...but for every success, there are also moments it feels as if it's trying too hard (wearing a sign that says \"look how dark & witty I am\"). This novel has much to say, and much of it is engrossing and compelling and funny...but it walks a fine line around repulsive & obsessed, and occasionally slips off that line. It doesn't make for an easy reading experience, but definitely a fascinating one."}, {"userName": "Dean Italiano", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1374827-dean-italiano", "userReview": "I picked this book out randomly at the Library. I was looking for something quirky and funny. I was right, it is very quirky and has some humour to it that can be a little hit and miss - but I get what the author was going for and can appreciate it.On the back there's a quote from Eric McCormack, an unwilling and real life character in the book, \"I've often wondered how a novel's characters might asses the book they've been thrust, unwillingly, into - like the victims of a kidnapping. Well now it's actually happened to me. Once I got over the shock of finding myself there...\" and he goes on to say something nice. Well, I know Eric McCormack, he was an English Professor of mine at UofW. I thought it was quite odd to use a real person in a novel without them knowing.The main character, Thomas, works in a book store where the employees form a snobby club and burn what they deem to be crappy books. A C-level celebrity who promotes these crappy books becomes enemy #1, and he is kidnapped and beaten. Thomas runs from authorities, and we read about this story from his on-the-lamb letters to Eric, with clips or newspaper articles scattered throughout.Here's where my low rating comes from... The author uses real books, real names of authors, and bashes the hell out of them. A couple of times might have been somewhat amusing and would have made the point. The continual bashing and complaining made the book come across as a whiny, soap-box speech. The funny parts became less funny, and it took a long time to get to the conclusion. I just wasn't enjoying it.I picked it off the shelf because I really liked the title, still do! But I didn't like the characters, who didn't really develop or learn anything in the end. I wanted to like it more.As an author, and I happened to be using my most recent .31 cent cheque as a bookmark, I thought writing a non-literary, quirky book that absolutely slams non-literary books...was a lot to overcome."}, {"userName": "Mark Rayner", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/308856-mark-rayner", "userReview": "Shelf Monkey is an entertaining and iconoclastic look at the world of books. It\u2019s a little like Catch-22, but instead of bombers and Italian prostitutes there are big box book stores and people eating pizza. The role of Yossarian is played by a confirmed and inveterate book nerd (named Thomas). Thomas has recently quit his career as a lawyer, and decided to work at a book store, because he loves book. At least, he THOUGHT he loved books. Turns out, he only likes good books. And working at a big-box-book store, Thomas discovers that not everyone has the same (good) taste. Especially when the execrable predilections of the wildly popular Munroe Purvis encourage the great unwashed to buy books of dubious value.Unlike Yossarian, Redekop's protagonist is actually able to accomplish something. Something weird, a bit dangerous, and even anarchic -- burning books. Not all books, just the overhyped, the unredeemably bad, the dreck of the literary world.Part Chuck Palahniuk, part readers guide to great literature, Shelf Monkey is a must for anyone with pretensions to being a bibliophile. You'll love it. For those of you who are okay with not reading every great book in the history of literature, you may find the continual literary references a bit tiring, but there's still lots to love.

But in all honesty, the book is pretentious in a dozen ways, thank goodness the narrator/protagonist has a bit of integrity or I would have just given this novel one star.Lots of name dropping of authors and books, it was almost as if the author was trying to be a bit too heady, or send the reader straight to a google search. I like Pynchon and Bukowski as much as the next geek but come one- Bukowski is just weird, not necessarily learning big life lessons from that one. How many references does that author need?

At times I found it hilarious, at others, uncomfortable. The story unfolds in a series of emails, following the narrative of Thomas Friesen, who has apparently done something very, very bad, and is currently on the run. He is unveiled as a former lawyer who suffers from anxiety, found himself on anti-depressants and was working in a bookshop. He and his bookshop colleagues were well-read, well-educated extreme book enthusiasts who were subjected on a daily basis to the horrors of customers eschewing good literature in favour of horribly written, lightweight, book club recommendations made by one, Munroe Purvis, talk show host and destroyer of minds. After months of wondering what grand secret his co-workers are excluding him from, Thomas was finally inducted into the ranks of the Shelf Monkeys, who are ridding the world of horrible literature, one hideous book at a time. What he did not realise is how far they were willing to go when Purvis came to town, and how deeply it would affect his life.What I especially enjoyed: The writing style in this book was flamboyant and fluid. The story was unexpected and unconventional. The actions of the characters made me pause and think about my own prejudices and how I react to things I absolutely can't stand in others' behaviour, which is what made me uncomfortable: this story's reach is deep.A critical point: I thought Thomas could have gone farther down the path he ultimately, although ambivalently chose, and it would have made the ending more (hilariously) horrifying. Overall: An excellent, well written book: the work of a master craftsman. Definitely recommended."}, {"userName": "kingshearte", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3031302-kingshearte", "userReview": "Thomas Friesen has three goals in life. Get a job. Make friends. Find a good book to curl up with. After landing a job at READ, the newest hypermegabookstore, he feels he may have accomplished all three.All is not peaceable within the stacks, however. Dis content is steadily rising, and it is aimed squarely at Munroe Purvis, a talk show host whose wildly popular book club is progressively lowering the IQ of North America.But the bookworms have a plan. Plots are being hatched. The destruction of Munroe is all but assured. And as Thomas finds himself swept along in the maelstrom of insanity, he wonders if reading a book is all it's cracked up to be.Definitely a zippier read than the last one, although I have to admit, not what I was expecting. I was kind of expecting some fairly light-hearted satire about working in a bookstore, maybe something almost along the lines of Microserfs or JPod (assuming the latter - which I have not yet read - is anything like the TV show - of which a few episodes I have seen) filled with hilarious situations that, as a fellow bookseller, I could totally relate to and laugh along with. The \"destruction of Munroe\" would, I figured be some sort of hilarious prank that would humiliate and utterly discredit him, but be ultimately harmless. But that is not what this book is.For starters, aside from describing Thomas's first few days at the bookstore, while he acclimatizes to what it's like to work there, the book doesn't really deal with working there at all. It's much more about the relationships between the people, and their relationships with books. It especially focuses on the Shelf Monkey meetings, where a group of disaffected bookstore employees, tired of having the sell utter crap to customers at the expense of good stuff, gather together to burn copies of some of the offending crap.Then there's Munroe Purvis. When I sarted reading, I assumed he was supposed to represent Oprah and her omnipresent book club, and booksellers' mild to severe aggravation about that. However, as even the book points out, while it's irritating that people won't read something amazing like A Fine Balance, for example unless Oprah tells them to, and then you better believe they're all over it, the fact remains that she does pick such things. If you look back at Oprah's picks, there is some pretty fantastic stuff in there. There's the occasional tripe, too, but yeah. She picks some decent stuff. Munroe Purvis, on the other hand, is basically blatantly opposed to anything worthwhile. His picks are exclusively overwrought, heartwrenching, steaming piles of crap. Redekop must have had a blast writing a few excerpts from one of these books, because it is the most painfully, nauseatingly saccharine bit of tripe I've ever had the dubious pleasure of reading (Oh who am I kidding. I loved reading it. Actually laughed out loud about it. But would definitely hurl a book across the room if I ever had to read more than one page of such inanity.). So he was a great maddeningly omnipotent presence, and all the customers his mindless zombies, ready to chew up the latest dreadful offering from him, and while we real-life booksellers may not have it quite that bad, we can definitely still relate to everything that goes on as a result of this man and his atrocious books.Except the final thing. As I said before, I fully expected some sort of prank that would be funny. But what the Shelf Monkeys ultimately ended up doing was pretty intense and horrifying. And while I understand their frustration, yeah. It really changed some of the characters in my view, and makes them much less likable, because no one deserves what they did, really. I can sort of get behind the ones who, like Thomas, got swept up in it, but as soon as it was over, went \"Oh my god, what did we do?\", but a few of them seemed to still believe, even after the mania wore off, that what they did was perfectly justified, and it's kind of hard to accept that.But there it is. And lest you think I don't think it was good, I did. It was a good book. Quick read, quite compelling, and for sure relatable, at least in some places, if you've ever worked with books.

I wasn't quite sure why the synopsis made it seem like a light-hearted romp through a serious plot line.I needn't have worried.While narrating from the voice of someone who may very well be certifiably insane from the first interview, Redekop maintains a superior point of view in his characters' taste in literature, but doesn't drown the reader in it. Obscure references are explained within the context, and most are basic, well-known thematic ideas that serve to illustrate the frustration throughout the story. In fact, toward the end, I admit it infected me with a bit of self-righteousness as well. To address some of the other reviews, which I mistakenly perused prior to completing this novel: Of course some of the characters are hyperbolic - refer back to 'certifiable narrator' - and by the end, they really needed to have been drawn that way. The narrator himself may not be taken seriously by some readers, but anyone even casually familiar with mental disorders will understand him completely. And I'm actually glad that the much-hated Munroe Purvis was made out to be a contemporary of the well-known talk show hosts, and not an actual famous personality placed into that role.

Oprah, as even Monroe Purvis points out, actually reads some good books; she's used her position to encourage people to read Faulkner, Steinbeck, and Carson McCullers, among others.

Peppered with all sorts of book-geek goodies, all readers will find bits and pieces that speak to them on a deep, secret level that only lovers of the written word could appreciate.I should look through for reactions from pulp and casual readers and see if this is only for shelf monkeys~"}, {"userName": "Lil' Grogan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4347062-lil-grogan", "userReview": "Had a good laugh. The satirical depiction of that slippery path of nerd-dom: from devotion to pretension then over-zealousness, was hilarious. Also enjoyed and empathized with the dilemmas of the retail clerk.I wonder if it could have been polished more; it's quite slow in developing mainly due to Tommy's wordiness. But, at the same time, it was perfect for the character and his self-deprecating humour helped smooth my occasional annoyance. I could probably be harsher on certain aspects, but I spent too much time giggling. Also works as a test of the reader's nerdiness."}, {"userName": "Stephanie (aka WW)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38393925-stephanie-aka-ww", "userReview": "I could be a Shelf Monkey. Would jump at the chance if given the opportunity. I think that officially makes me a book snob. Oh, well, nothing I didn't already know. I loved this book. It spoke to my reading soul and made me laugh. It's hard to say anything concrete in review that wouldn't give the plot away. But if the shelves and shelves of Nicholas Sparks, LaVyrle Spencer and Danielle Steel make you cringe, you'll love this book."}, {"userName": "Mark Victor Young", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2347018-mark-victor-young", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this bibliophiles manifesto. It kept me guessing to the end and enjoyed the the outrage of the Shelf Monkeys. Lots of now familiar scenarios are taken to the Nth degree, such as inane book clubs, illiteracy and big box bookstores.
