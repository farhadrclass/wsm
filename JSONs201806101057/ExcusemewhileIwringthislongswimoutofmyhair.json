But instead of feeling I\u2019ll arrive, the world appears to pour towards whatever I\u2019m getting away from. Cows and foliage blur by and I try to imagine easing into couch cushions, or the plunge back onto the bed, quilt whooshing up from behind. Still, I can\u2019t shake the faint dyslexia reverse riding brings, the suspicion I\u2019m rushing assbackwards into the future, kick-me sign tacked to my spine, a breech birth with no eye for what\u2019s ahead until it crashes into the past, the inkling I\u2019m a fool doing the backstroke smack up against the wall of the pool."}, {"userName": "Antonia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia", "userReview": "Absolute favorite line of all:What is the heart but anothermouth to be fed?"}, {"userName": "marnelle angela", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2376403-marnelle-angela", "userReview": "'Excuse me while I wring this long swim out of my hair'is a short collection of poems. It was pure joy reading this one. The underlying meanings are to savor for. This book reminds me of the comfort of drinking a hot coffee, the excitement of long talks with my best friend over the phone and the emotional vomit after reading a tragic book."}, {"userName": "Margaryta", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3692642-margaryta", "userReview": "Really unusual and moving poems that transported me into the moment. I loved the delicate yet biting nature of each on0, and the fact that the haunting feeling that began from the first poem continued throughout the entire collection and beyond, staying with me after the last page. There was something magical in these poems that I absolutely adored."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3899868-kathleen", "userReview": "Hmmm, I thought I had reviewed this here, but I had just rated it! This is no doubt because I was reviewing it for Prick of the Spindle!:http://www.prickofthespindle.com/revi...And there is also a preview with sample poems here, at Escape Into Life:http://www.escapeintolife.com/blog/lo...Anyway, as you can guess from the above and my 5 stars, I love this book. Short powerful evocative poems, simultaneously mysterious and accessible--so not too \"accessible\" in that way that freaks out serious readers and writers of poetry, though I very much appreciate poems I can understand. I also appreciate these, because I can mostly understand them but am left unsure and wanting more, but in a good way. Like when you know you ate a healthy meal, and it was beautiful and tasty and you are still a little hungry but it's just because you need to digest a little more...For instance, now I'm thinking \"On the Way to Meet My Daughter's Teacher\" really is about the suicidal urge, real if fleeting, rendered as a bus stop smoking break, survived.Oh, and here's \"Reindeer\" from this book, appearing now in YB: Animals:http://ybanimals.wordpress.com/sloat/All that should give you a good taste of the book!"}, {"userName": "Harry Rutherford", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford", "userReview": "I'd almost forgotten I ordered this book, but it arrived this morning and I read my way through it with a cup of green tea in the friend's room at Tate Modern.I really enjoyed it. There's some seriously good writing in there. Unusually for me (I'm a literal minded soul) I preferred the less obvious poems, though this may be down to my slightly hungover state. Anyway. I seem to be rambling at this point.EDIT: some poor phrasing there. 'Obvious' is a rather unflattering sounding term to apply to poems, which wasn't my intention. I liked all of them, but was particularly struck by some of those with less clearly-defined subjects."}, {"userName": "Richard Holleman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41854891-richard-holleman", "userReview": "This book is another reason why Sarah Jane Sloat is my favorite contemporary poet. The poems are fresh, imaginative, and beautifully written. I would list my favorite poems from the book, but the truth is they're all my favorite! Each poem in this collection has something special to offer the reader."}, {"userName": "Leon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4022104-leon", "userReview": "S. Jane's Sloat delighted me in each and every poem. Turning the page was like finding a new treasure, I was excited to continue reading and was saddened when I got to the last one, each poem was exceptionality written and touching. Sloat is magnificent inspiration for female writers/poets."}], "description": "the dancing girl press chapbook series was founded in 2004 to publish and promote the work of women poets and artists through chapbooks, journals, book arts projects, and anthologies.
