He's an English teacher who gets to spend quality time with his son since he started working part-time. However, Joe's naivety is going to bring his whole way of life to the very brink. On the fateful day that Joe sees his wife's car entering an underground car park, and decides to follow her, his life will never ever be the same again. He witnesses her arguing with family friend Ben, and life as he knew it will begin to unravel in a most spectacular fashion.Omg! What a page turner this was. I actually found Joe to be very naive and there were times when I wanted to shout \" Open your eyes Joe, see what's really going on around you\" However, I still loved this book, it was so scary, the manner in which Joe's life disintegrated, a man who was completely innocent of any wrongdoing. This book is a great example of why psychological thrillers are so popular right now.

Have you ever dropped in unexpectedly on your spouse, when and where they least expected to see you?Joe Lynch did when his young son, Will, spotted his wife\u2019s car in traffic, \u00a0he followed, intrigued as she turned into a hotel car park. \u00a0\u00a0Just one impulsive decision and BAM, Joe\u2019s life will never be the same. \u00a0Not for him, his family or their friends either. The fabric of our lives can seem so thin when it is suddenly pulled out from under us, never more so than when it has been woven with lies, one overlapping another. And now Joe\u2019s very freedom is at risk and so much more. It would seem that the trend in writing these days is the unexpected twist, which in effect you know, completely negates the whole unanticipated thing. \u00a0Enough said about that. :)If you like psychological thrillers that are both relatable and compelling, I can assure you that this one will keep you turning those pages. \u00a0\u00a0This is my first experience with TM Logan but I will most definitely be going back to the well.

Once you get near enough, there's no way out.Four year old William spots his mother's familiar car entering into a below ground parking lot of a hotel in North London while riding in the back seat of his father's car. He begs his father, Joe Lynch, to follow her course and surprise her. Joe turns around and the two pursue Melissa into the hotel. From a distance Joe can spot his wife in a heated argument with Ben Delaney, a family friend. Something doesn't seem quite right. Joe swoops up William and they rush back to the parking lot.Suddenly, Ben is behind Joe and an argument ensues. Joe backs off, but Ben punches him and in the midst of the encounter Ben falls backwards and hits his head. Just then William appears gasping for breath and in the middle of an asthma attack. There's no \"puff puff\" in the glove compartment so Joe rushes home leaving Ben on the ground. When they return to the parking lot later, there is no sign of Ben. He doesn't answer his cell phone. What exactly happened here?T.M. Logan will take readers on quite the tension-filled ride through our present day dependency on the internet and the lock-in of technology. We never actually realize the intrusive nature of that lovely convenience held constantly in the palm of our hand. Joe Lynch will be brought to his senses as he finds himself on the receiving end of technology that outsmarts him at every step. And, of course, there's an app and software for every need, now isn't there? But it's the human element and its very input that lights the match.I actually rated this one more at 3.5* but kicked it up to 4*. The beginning stages of the book were highly addictive. The second half seemed to drift off into building a contrived set with all the remaining Legos. Some pieces fit. Others did not. Still an entertaining read. Let's see what T.M.

Suddenly his marriage, career and freedom are all put to the test when he becomes the target of an obsessive technology entrepreneur who gets exactly what he wants and is very used to winning; in this instance, Joe\u2019s partner of twelve-years, wife for the nine and mother of his four-year-old son, William. Or so it seems, and whilst niggling doubts force Joe to continually question the evidence and just what he is seeing, he is unable to turn back the clock and once the genie is of out the bottle the collateral damage is only a matter of time. What starts as familiar psychological thriller territory with a split second decision results in unprecedented upheaval in the life of the Lynch family.The trivial decision that leads up to the fallout is a chance sighting of wife, Melissa\u2019s car on a school run home, with young son, William, eager to share the news of his superstar certificate from show it to his mum. Following her into a Premier Inn car park, Joe witnesses a heated exchange between Mel and former working class Northerner, turned self-made millionaire and alpha male, Ben Delaney, the husband of a close female friend of hers. from school. As Joe confronts Ben, an angry scuffle ensues and results in an unconscious Ben sprawled on the concrete floor and unresponsive. When Joe returns to the scene there is no sign of either Ben or his swish car, but that evening a series of incriminating social media posts on Joe\u2019s Facebook timeline are just the first of some increasingly strange happenings. Days later and unable to make contact with Ben the news from his fragile wife, Beth, that he has disappeared and gone incommunicado puts friendships under strain with Joe and Mel both knowing just a little too much about his final movements before the disappearance.Losing his phone and having his Facebook account hacked is just the start of Joe\u2019s unravelling as it appears that his nemesis in lying in wait in the shadows and staying carefully out of the public domain, all in a very concerted effort to necessitate the police to up the investigation into the whereabouts of Ben from missing person status to concern for his safety and a proof-of-life inquiry. All it takes is a week and a day for Joe to go from voluntarily approaching the police right through to his arrest for murder in what is treated as a no-body murder inquiry. As it seems that the onus on acquiring proof that Ben is behind his nightmare is on Joe\u2019s shoulder, he realises that he must take proactive action to save his own skin. For all the unknown mobiles and emails that Joe believes is evidence of Ben\u2019s stalking with intent to harm, the police counter with their own reservations, appearing sceptical that Joe has been doing anything but simply trying to wilfully obtain evidence of stalking where none exists. Just as he makes headway, wife Mel is waiting with a further tearful revelation and no soon has she promised that she is done with the lies and has told Joe the truth, once and for all, the beleaguered and beaten Joe finds himself on the receiving end of another blow. The longer the story progressed it is increasingly hard to believe that Melissa is ever being straight with Joe, despite her continued ascertains that she has disclosed everything any savvy reader will be yelling, \u201cyeah, right..\u201d as Joe is lured back for yet more punishment. Honestly, Joe acts like he is punch drunk, reeling from one disclosure to the next technology headache, from spyware, tracking devices, Bluetooth, forensic analysis of text messaging right through to metadata (\u201cdata about data\u201d).Although this starts by examining a likely scenario which is perfectly believable and the technology intricacies have been pinned down brilliantly to make most of the story potentially plausible, it all feels rather like trial by technology and social media and for me it did become a little repetitive. The writing is pretty bog-standard and feels more like a series of diary accounts being relayed, with next to no examination of heartfelt emotions but with the emphasis on the fast and furious description of events. Whilst this style of writing is perfectly readable, it is pretty anodyne and hard to get behind with any real heart. The characterisation also feels a little weak and although it is Joe who readers will come to know the best he is the living and breathing embodiment of a naive, wide-eyed family man who bears the brunt of the childcare with Mel assuming the role of the more independent party. Joe\u2019s middle name should be \u201csucker\u201d and leading ladies Mel and wife of Ben, Beth, just feel a little detached and removed from the emotion. I found myself continuously questioning events the longer this one went on and at just shy of five-hundred-pages, it does go on (and on)!Would a dynamic businessman with his own highly profitable company really go off the radar as it appears that Ben has? Would the police really be satisfied with the results of a cursory glance for a proof of life inquiry before launching so speedily into focusing on foul play? Would a successful family man go to such extraordinary lengths to cause someone damage? Lie\u2019s is marred a little by several disappointing aspects, firstly the absolutely ludicrous and over the top police response. Given that local police stations in the suburbs of London are now being closed down and manpower is leaner than ever, it is ridiculous to believe that the police would quickly launch into a full scale search for a body and have the spare capacity to devote their energies to a full scale search of a woods with ground-penetrating radar and police divers, and then a full house search and seizure.Whilst Lie\u2019s doesn\u2019t really bring anything new to the psychological thriller genre, merely concentrating on how much social media and technology have the potential to impact a person's life, it does add another perspective to things and has made me consider how much technology has impinged upon all our lives. Posing questions about a persons relationship with technology and how much importance it has come to assume over our lives, this mediocre psychological thriller is a rapid, quick-fire read, but the basic premise of, \u201ccan I trust my partner?\u201d, lies at the root and is a little overdone within the genre. What now feels like the required left-field twist that hijacks the story into the closing pages never really rang true for me and even looking back on the novel after finishing it there was never any indication of what was to come. Perhaps if T.M. Logan has dropped a few hints along the way his conclusion might have all felt a little more plausible. Not recommended for Luddite\u2019s who loathe the way technology has overtaken the world and altered our communications."}, {"userName": "Erin Clemence", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16907451-erin-clemence", "userReview": "Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for a free, electronic ARC of this novel. \nDuring an unexpected detour on a drive out with his son, Joe spots his wife, arguing heatedly with their long-time friend, Ben.

Not only does Logan keep a reader on her toes, but he also has a knack for making a reader paranoid and doubtful of his fellow man (even those close to her).The plot of this story was particularly creative, as it is the kind of novel that could end very predictably, and there were many times when I thought I had figured out the end, but I didn\u2019t even come close. I doubted Joe, I doubted Mel (his wife), I doubted everyone- no one was safe from my judgment. However, when the end came, I was extremely satisfied and completely taken aback.

One day, on his way home from picking up his son, he spots his wife's car. William wants to surprise her and say hi, so they follow her into a parking garage of a hotel. What they see is Mel clearly in a heated argument with her best friend Beth's husband Ben.

Now Ben is missing, and Joe has started receiving increasingly threatening messages. How did he manage to get caught up in a missing person's investigation, and why is his wife lying about what happened in the hotel? All will be answered by the end of the book!Lies was my second buddy read with Sam from Clues and Reviews, so keep an eye on her blog because her review will be posted soon!I was hooked on Lies from page one! I really just couldn't put it down. I think I read it in about two sittings, because I was dying to find out. I loved Joe and his son Will. I think their characters were well developed, and I was rooting for him, even though there were definitely times where he seemed a little naive, however I think that was natural. Not everyone is ridiculously suspicious of everyone in their life when there has been no reason to not trust them in the past. Without giving anything away, I'll also say that I LOVED the ending! I'd been trying the entire book to put all of the puzzle pieces together, and hadn't managed it, so the end came as a total surprise for me, and it was perfect. I put the book down and immediately messaged Sam to tell her I'd finished the book and \"OMG!!!!\" - I immediately needed to talk to someone about it!If you're looking for a fast paced psychological thriller, this is the book for you!

Joe pulls over to see why his wife is there and captures her arguing with her best friend's husband. Joe tries to intervene in the situation and it changes the rest of his life. Without going any further into the story, Joe questions whether or not he was meant to intervene in his wife's conflict and how will it affect the perfect life that he has so humbly enjoyed.I really enjoyed reading \nLies\n\u2014the writing is fiercely robust while the story is engaging and vastly entertaining. At over 400 pages, the story really packs a punch and doesn't ever feel like a slow burn. I was very surprised that T.M. Logan was able to craft such a multifaceted story arc using similar domestic thriller themes that have oversaturated the market. \nLies\n is an original tale that delivers. Initially, I felt that this story was going to follow in the footsteps of every domestic thriller story written since 2016, but \nLies\n really is in a ballpark of it's own. I had to deduct a half of a star (out of 5) due to the fact that the only time that the story felt rushed was at the end. \nLies\n never skipped a beat throughout the story, but the ending was a little disappointing. The details of the story were never left out; the plot was thoroughly enjoyable and believable; and then we get a finale that was was rushed and abbreviated. I wanted more, but it doesn't take away from my overall satisfaction with this story. \nLies\n is a book that you need on your reading list."}, {"userName": "Selena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1932900-selena", "userReview": "I received a free e-copy of Lies by T.M. Logan from NetGalley for my honest review.This was a crazy, exciting, psychological thriller of a book. The title is very appropriate for the book as there are lies on top of lies. My head was on a constant swivel. As soon as I thought I worked my way around a lie and had it figured out there were 5 more and they just kept coming. The outcome of the book I just never saw coming. A very intense read with very intense lies. Can you sort out the lies from the truth or is there really any truth?"}, {"userName": "Louise Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42343152-louise-wilson", "userReview": "Joe Lynch is with his young son William in the car when he spots his wife in her car.

He was driving his young son home when William spotted his mother\u2019s car. Joe decided to follow and surprise her. However Joe was the one that ended up with the surprise!This story tells of how one split second decision can completely change your life and turn it on its head. When you realise that the foundations of your safe and comfortable life are built on a lie and you are helpless as it falls to dust around you. Add in the complexities and dangers of social media and you have one heck of a twisted story.I raced through Lies at every opportunity and didn\u2019t want to put it down. I took an instant liking to Joe and was rooting for him all the way. He was an ordinary husband with an ordinary job who loved his family and he certainly didn\u2019t deserve the whole heap of trouble that landed on his head. There were times when I was berating him for being too trusting and perhaps, rather na\u00efve but then if you had no reason to suspect someone you would trust them.This was a cracker of a read with some excellent characterisations and as you may have guessed from the book description and tagline, has many twists and turns. I\u2019m not going to say what or where they are \u2013 you need to read it for yourself but if you like a fast paced story that will take you on a rollercoaster of a read, then this is a book that I have no hesitation in recommending. I really enjoyed this debut thriller and can\u2019t want to see what the author comes up with next."}, {"userName": "Mandie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58327890-mandie", "userReview": "I won a copy of this book from Goodreads.

The writing is phenomenal. It literally pulls the reader into the story and hijacks their attention. As the title suggests, this thriller is about LIES. Joe Lynch and his wife Mel have the perfect marriage until Joe accidentally witnesses Mel in a heated argument with family friend Ben at a hotel when she is supposed to be playing tennis with a friend. As Ben flees the situation, Joe confronts him and a fight ensues between them. Ben is knocked unconscious at the same time as Joe's 4 year old son has an asthma attack. In a split second decision, Joe opts to leave Ben lying there to rush his son home for his inhaler. When Joe returns later, Ben is gone and so starts a series of cat and mouse like events that uncover more and more lies. It was quite refreshing to read a domestic thriller from the perspective of a male. Typically it is through a female POV so such a nice change having Joe tell the story. The character development was impeccable. Even Joe's 4 year old son had a strong voice and the dynamic of being a parent was well portrayed. The tension got the better of me in this one. I found myself burning the candle at both ends to find out what was going to happen next. This book is all about the build up and burn. I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a slow burn because the plot gallops along at a fast pace. There is one significant twist but overall it's not THAT kind of thriller. Its strength lies in its writing and characterization. A fast and compelling read that most people will have a hard time putting down.Thank you to T.M. Logan and Macmillan for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

Even though the chapters were short they seemed to always end with a question that would make you want to read the next chapter to get the answer, which made it a quick read, in my opinion. The plot was well thought out and the ending had a nice twist. It may make you wonder about the safety of technology and social media as well.I highly recommend this book for those who like thriller/mystery type genres."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20608600-laura", "userReview": "A well written debut domestic thriller; the genre of which is very en vogue right now. Although a relatively large read, the author does well not to allow his writing to drag and keeps the reader interested throughout. It was refreshing to read a story with a male protagonist as I have become used to reading books from a female perspective, particularly those focusing on secrets and martial lies. Joe is a secondary school teacher and has a beautiful, vivacious wife and young son. When a chance encounter with the husband of a friend of his wife leaves the other party injured, Joe unwittingly begins a dangerous game of cat and mouse. This is one of those stories I could see being easily adapted into a tv drama, it has that kind of appeal. I would certainly watch it. The storyline is gripping and paced very well; the author does not fall into the trap of hurrying along the books climax or tidying up all the loose ends in a pretty package like many others do. Sometimes it works to leave a little to the readers imagination...I look forward to the authors second book, due to be released in early 2018."}], "description": "WHAT IF YOUR WHOLE LIFE WAS BASED ON LIES?When Joe Lynch stumbles across his wife driving into a hotel car park while she's supposed to be at work, he's intrigued enough to follow her in.And when he witnesses her in an angry altercation with family friend Ben, he knows he ought to intervene.But just as the confrontation between the two men turns violent, and Ben is knocked unconscious, Joe's young son has an asthma attack - and Joe must flee in order to help him.When he returns, desperate to make sure Ben is OK, Joe is horrified to find that Ben has disappeared.And that's when Joe receives the first message . . .", "title": "Lies", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33652433-lies", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1483232263l/33652433.jpg", "reviews": 629, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15961927.T_M_Logan", "name": "T.M.
