According to Connor, Mormonism most comfortably and authentically fits with the freedom philosophy than with any other ideology out there. Although I was convinced of that notion before reading this book, I find it hard for somebody to be a fully-committed Mormon and adhere to any ideology other than that of classical liberalism. There are certainly doubters out there, and those who wish to skew Mormonism through the lens of their own already established political commitments, but I think they will find themselves hard-pressed to reconcile any other competing ideology with Mormonism after they have read Latter-day Liberty, with a humble heart and open mind. Overall, it was an easily accessible read. He took some philosophical concepts that can be difficult for the uninitiated to comprehend or wrestle through, and made them very graspable. Connor is doing a great work in trying to grow the Liberty Movement in Utah, and in particular, reawakening Mormons to their classical liberal foundation."}, {"userName": "Jeff Stockett", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2950483-jeff-stockett", "userReview": "This is an excellent book. Though the LDS church does not get involved in the political process, it certainly teaches principles that can be applied to politics. This book takes the opportunity to examine politics from a Latter Day Saint perspective. It is a non partisan approach to government. In fact, this book criticizes both political parties and points out that neither of them have been perfect champions of liberty.This book draws on information from the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and quotes from prophets both modern and ancient to pick apart what it means to truly believe in liberty. It also gives strong historical background and information from a constitutional perspective.I don't consider myself a libertarian, but I do consider myself a constitutionally based conservative. I didn't necessarily agree with all of his points in this book, but every argument he made was well backed up with quotes and arguments from either a constitutional perspective or a gospel one. So it will definitely make me reexamine some of my beliefs.Here is some of the wisdom to be found in this book:On Liberty generally:\"The Kingdom of God is a Kingdom of freedom; the gospel of the Son of God is the gospel of liberty.\" - President Joseph F. Smith p. 1\"I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves.\" - Joseph Smith p. 12\"Our most important need as defenders of liberty is to know what true liberty is, to teach it, to profess it, and to testify of it.\" - Elder Charles Didier p. 15\"There is a feeling that the government should step in and take care of one's needs, one's emergencies, and one's future...Under this climate, people gradually become blind to what has happened and to the vital freedoms which they have lost.\" - President Howard W. Hunter p. 123On the war in heaven (the conflict between liberty and coercion)\"Christ stood for government by persuasion, by long suffering, by kindness and gentleness and love unfeigned. The other power was for government and salvation for all, to be secured by the spirit of force and compulsion, wherein all would be saved without agency, or what we call common consent.\" - President Charles W. Nibley p. 17\"Freedom is based on truth, and no man is completely free as long as any part of his belief is based on error.\" - President N. Eldon Tanner p. 252\"We are involved in an intense battle. It is a battle between right and wrong, between truth and error, between the design of the Almighty on the one hand and that of Lucifer on the other. For that reason, we desperately need moral men and women who stand on principle, to be involved in the political process. Otherwise, we abdicate power to those whose designs are almost entirely selfish.\" President Gordon B. Hinckley p. 252\"Laws provide against injury from others; but not from ourselves. God himself will not save men against their wills.\" - Thomas Jefferson p. 24\"I believe in only one thing: liberty. But I do not believe in even liberty enough to want to force it upon anyone.\" - H. L. Mencken p. 24\"We must be careful that we are not led to accept or support in any way any organization, cause, or measure which, in its remotest effect, would jeopardize free agency, whether it be in politics, government, religion, employment, education, or any other field. It is not enought for us to be sincere in what we support. We must be right!\" - President Marion G. Romney p. 26\"One of Lucifer's primary strategies has been to restrict our agency through the power of earthly governments. Proof of this is found in the long history of humanity.\" - Ezra Taft Benson p. 26\"Besides the preaching of the Gospel, we have another mission, namely, the perpetuation of the free agency of man and the maintenance of liberty, freedom, and the rights of man.\" - John Taylor p. 30On the Constitution\"The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard: it is founded in the wisdom of God.\" - Joseph Smith p. 58\"It is no less tyrannical for the public to vote on whether you must purchase health care insurance, or what type of light bulbs you may purchase, or how a portion of your property will be diverted to help those in need. Majoritarian control in a democracy produces no inherent virtues, and its dictates can be extremely destructive to liberty.\" Connor Boyack p. 73\"In questions of power then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution.\" - Thomas Jefferson p. 79\"The Constitution of the United States is a great and treasured part of my religion, and the revelations of the Lord and the word of our inspired leaders compel it to be so. The overturning, or the material changing, or the distortion of any fundamental principle of our constitutional government would thus do violence to my religion.\" - President J. Reuben Clark p. 91On War\"war is incompatible with Christ's teachings...it is vain to attempt to reconcile war with true Christianity.\" - President David O. Mckay p. 173On Education\"No man is saved faster than he gets knowledge.\" - Joseph Smith p. 201\"One of the greatest threats of the word of the Lord today comes from false educational ideas.\" - President Harold B. Lee p. 202\"I would rather have my child exposed to smallpox, typhus fever, cholera or other malignant and deadly diseases than to the degrading influence of a corrupt teacher.\" - Karl Maeser, founder of BYU p. 204 On Welfare\"Government is the great fiction, through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.\" Frederic Bastiat p. 232\"The government seems too anxious to give, give, give to the poor, to the aged, to the schools, to everyone, and blinded people feel they are getting something, whereas they pay it to the government so that the government can after great overhead expense return a part of it to the people. And every time a gift returns to the people (a so-called gift) it comes with fetters binding and tying and enslaving. For every block of funds given to the people, they lose a bigger block of liberty.\" - President Spencer W. Kimball p. 232Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.\" - C.S. Lewis p. 232In trying to perpetuate the idea that the government should financially support people, \"men become anti-Christ, because those teachings strike directly at the doctrines of the Savior.\" David O. McKay p. 237\"What is the real cause of this trend toward the welfare state, toward more socialism? In the last analysis, in my judgment, it is personal unrighteousness. When people do not use their freedoms responsibly and righteously, they will gradually lose these freedoms.\" - President Howard W. Hunter p. 238\"Consecration and communism have nothing in common...it is a strange thing that there are members of the Church who cannot distinguish the difference between the two.\" - Joseph Fielding Smith p. 246"}, {"userName": "Daron", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1411665-daron", "userReview": "In a quest to better understand the ORIGINS and INTENTS of the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Independence, I have been reading a LOT of non-fiction related to those subjects of late. My list of reading has included John Locke, Brion McClanahan, Frederic Bastiat, Ezra Taft Benson, J. Reuben Clark, Heber J. Grant, Abel Upshur, Thomas Paine, Cleon Skousen, Hugh Nibley, and also George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, short quotes from many other Founders, and much more. Latter-Day Liberty by Connor Boyack further cements everything I have been discovering by these other authors: that Natural Law is GOD'S LAW, and every one of God\u2019s children has rights that COME FROM HIM, including LIFE, LIBERTY, and the right to PROPERTY so that we might pursue happiness. Mr. Boyack does a phenomenal job of explaining these principles to the reader, but goes further than that . . . he ties these principles to the intents of the founding fathers, and thereafter shows not only some of the origins of our sacred founding documents (because, YES, it DOES matter what the founders were reading at the time of their inspired work), but also some of the key historical turning points where government was improperly, and deceitfully, changed into the tyrannical leviathan that we have today. Truly, our Founders would not recognize their produced Republic any longer. For that matter, even \u201cwe the people\u201d can\u2019t seem to understand that this is NOT a democracy, and was never intended to be such. But, I digress . . .Kudos, Mr. Boyack: This is one of the best books on the subject of Liberty that I have ever read."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1999320-michelle", "userReview": "Latter Day Liberty is a timely book that redraws the line between liberty and tyranny in a political climate where that line has been obscured. While the two major political parties do nothing more than perpetuate each other\u2019s policies and put on a front of fighting for freedom, this book brings clarity to the concept of genuine liberty. Primarily directed to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, it examines Church history and doctrine from the standpoint of liberty and gives direction to how it applies to the issues of today. Latter Day Liberty is compelling and easy to understand for the average reader, yet is profound enough to pique the interest of more technical readers. Reading this book will leave one spiritually uplifted and better informed on important topics of today."}, {"userName": "Josh Steimle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4752106-josh-steimle", "userReview": "Disclaimer: I know Connor a bit. Not best buds or anything, but I've met him a few times and we communicate sometimes via email. Knowing a bit about Connor and what he's written on his blog, I had expectations of something good, but not quite on this level. Plus I wasn't a big fan of the cover, so my expectations were tempered by that. But I was quite impressed with the book. Maybe it's because I just finished and the glow will wear off after a few days, but man, this is great stuff. I've read a lot of books on libertarianism over the past few years, but this one puts much of it in one place, in easy to understand terms, with plenty of references and quotes to back it all up. If someone can read this and not be convinced of the overlap between libertarian ideals and the gospel I'll be surprised."}, {"userName": "James Davis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2009915-james-davis", "userReview": "Latter-day Liberty provides a much needed clarity and perspective on the proper role between man, God, and government. Topic by topic Boyack suggests scripturally based remedies to many of the social, economic, and political ailments facing society. The overall message is consistent with a standard laid out by Joseph Smith that: \"All men are, or ought to be free, possessing unalienable rights, and the high and noble qualifications of the laws of nature and of self-preservation, to think, and act, and say as they please, while they maintain a due respect to the rights and privileges of all other creatures, infringing upon none.\" (HOTC 5:156) Controversial, enlightening and bulletproof, this book is a must read for anyone who participates (or wishes to participate) in the civic process."}, {"userName": "Cami", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/820910-cami", "userReview": "For me the real value of this book is as a collection of great quotes on libertarianism from a wide range of thinkers; quoting everyone from Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard to Ezra Taft Benson and David O. McKay. My highlighter was busy as I read this. Intially, I was hoping this would be an Mormon-focused rendition of \"Defending the Undefendable\" because I do find that I'm constantly trying to reconcile my libertarian approach to social-issue politics with the morality of my religion. But the author spoke to much more general terms and broad theories (e.g. non-aggression, Just War Theory, etc.) and did very well in laying out those arguments supported by quotes from scripture, prophets and general authorities."}, {"userName": "D.M.

The first part of the book looks more at the philosophy, and the second part more at the implementation of that philosophy as illustrated by several high-profile policies, including war, immigration and the war on drugs.The book is very well written, succinct, cogent and - in my view - draws accurate conclusions. It is a book that all Christian people and lovers of liberty will find stimulating. For the LDS people, it is a book they should read and seriously contemplate."}, {"userName": "Holli", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1321002-holli", "userReview": "Politics isn't my cup of tea, but I picked up this book on recommendation from my father-in-law and figured it wouldn't hurt to broaden my knowledge a bit. The book was well researched and written. The author brought up some good and thought-provoking ideas. I was a little disappointed with some of his points, especially in the war section. However, I did learn a fair bit about liberty and it gave me several things to think about with regard to politics and the place of government. It changed the way I see how some things are done. Overall, a good book that I would recommend if you are looking for a book on liberty and politics in relationship to LDS gospel."}, {"userName": "Dwayne Toney", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16431838-dwayne-toney", "userReview": "Brilliant book!

A must-read for anyone who wants to understand and maintain our liberties. The first half of the book explains the background and foundation; then the second half applies everything to modern-day examples.
