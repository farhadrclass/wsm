If I read no other book this year --If this book won BEST BOOK of the year --ALL would be GROOVY in \"My Wonder Land\". I just died-and-went to heaven discovering this 'short-story-novel'. A reader cannot simply call this a collection of short stories. Nor can it be called a novel, per say. Think \"Fusion\". Fusion - mastery - Storytelling!!! Lauren Acampora is ridiculously talented. Her writing is vertiginously exciting! \"The Wonder Garden\" is a perfect book club choice. Being as fresh and original as it is --its also an opening for intellectually stimulating discussions. Rather than comment on each of the 13 stories individually --I'll quote a few sentences where I 'stopped' to to think. [I'm still thinking ...and will think about this book for a long time]....I am intentionally being careful --avoiding spoilers. 1) \"He understands now that every man keeps a detail or two in a neutral place inside his own brain, and the wise ones never enter that particular cabinet\".2)\"This is one of those times that being a mother feels like a form of slavery, this constant servitude to a tyrant's whims. Nothing can come fast enough for her daughter, nothing is enough. 3)\"Coming back here, it just reminds me how insidious nationalism always is. This place especially, with its fetishization of history and patriotism, is unbelievable. So much pride, but in what? This great country was founded on 'murder'. Do you know how many Native Americans were massacred in the colonies?\"4)\"But it was too fast, it was too slow. And one day he became a boy, kicking a bicycle to the ground.\"5)\"His name is Apocatequil, in case you meet him\"Love, love, love, this book!

Albeit some of them are more obsessed with this mission than others. The author's penchant for providing architectural details and description of historical artifacts was very interesting.So Acampola seems to me to write both with the perspective of an Anthropologist and an Archaeologist. The way the book is structured helps keep the reader engaged as you keep finding that characters from previous stories suddenly make an appearance a few stories later. The brilliance of Acampora's writing is that when these \"old\" characters reappear they haven't been frozen in time but rather have continue to develop and grow. This serves as a sort of \"plot acceleration mechanism\" that gives the reader a sense of reading a novel rather than one of short stories, but also provides its characters with more layers and nuance than you'd expect on this type of genre. The characters comes in all shapes and forms, there are married couples, single people, parents, children, doctors, artists and spiritual leaders.At first glance Old Cranbury looks like just another affluent, conventional town. But underneath its seemingly pleasant facade and its picture-perfect Victorian houses, we soon get to discover some of its most bizarre and disturbed residents. Throughout these stories we witness school boards arguments, judgmental neighbors that see themselves as the \"torchbearers, defenders of the original residents and their ideals\", quarrels over zoning and renovations plans and tensions over parenting styles. Here is a brief description of some of my favorites stories:The Wonder Garden- In the collection\u2019s title story, we follow a Christian housewife who welcomes a Bangladeshi foreign exchange student into her home, a decision that eventually leads to unexpected results.Floortime- It's about a mother struggling to reach her autistic son and who is desperate enough to consider using unconventional methods to achieve this goal.Elevations- About an aging gay couple struggles with their relationship and how their respective life journeys and personal growth has taken them apart .Swarm- A rich couple commissions a retired teacher with artistic aspirations to design giant insects to cover every external wall of their colonial home. The Umbrella Bird- Describes the story of a woman who must come to terms with her husband's drastic and unexpected career change. Moon Roof- Which I found fantastic, it's about a woman's inability to move into traffic, the whole story takes place while she's in her car frozen and seemingly unable to do anything. This experience would ultimately allow her to explore personal issues she has previously neglected to confront.Although each story can be read as a stand-alone, I think that reading them in order would give the reader a better understanding and a more satisfactory reading experience.The book offers some hints of social commentary but for the most part these characters remain completely involved in their privileged bubble, incapable of seeing beyond their suburban needs and their \"keeping up with the Joneses mentality\".The Wonder Garden it's a wonderful, deliciously bizarre collection of short stories written with depth and beautiful language. Although many of these characters are often odd, they are also deeply human, therefore easy to relate to. With its dark and creepy set of stories but also its refreshingly creative writing, I must definitely recommend this jewel of a book!"}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "As they approach the gate Bethany thinks of the town, small and safe, awaiting their return. It is cloistered, claustrophobically familiar, but maybe\u2014and her mother\u2019s trembling hands return to her\u2014mired with its own dark disturbances. It is its own kind of restive campground, in a way, its properties penciled upon common land, impinging on one another despite the fences meant to hold them apart. Huddled in that encampment are each of their families, steely cohorts within the greater clan.\nOld Cranbury, CT is an older, well established suburb. In the historical part of town some of its homes date from the 18th century, and still carry the names of the families who built them. \u00a0Residents of those particular homes take pride in preserving their piece of history, some of them maybe a bit too much. OC is a lovely place, a mostly middle and upper-middle-class suburb. Good schools, trimmed lawns. Unlike Chester\u2019s Mill, Wayward Pines, Royston Vasey, or the Village, you can leave if you choose, but you will want to stick around at least long enough to get through the baker\u2019s dozen stories about the local residents in The Wonder Garden. \u00a0 Lauren Acampora There are plenty of weeds in Lauren Acampara\u2019s linked-stories collection, but not the stories. The tales are flower-show ready. \u00a0I imagine we have all read, seen or heard groups of tales about a particular town, or location. Our Town, Spoon River (yes, yes, I know, poems, not stories), Olive Kitteridge. \u00a0Now, think hard. Were any of them yuck-fests? Didn\u2019t think so. Ditto here. It is true that most of these stories show a less than lovely side of life in Old Cranbury. The sins are far from original. Disappointment permeates. But there are rays of sunshine as well. Change is possible, at least for some. Hopes may be dashed, but not all of them, and that there are plenty to go around gives one hope that in their imagined lives, some of these folks might live to see their dreams come true. Most of the characters are just trying to make the best of their circumstances.\u00a0It would not be a portrait of a town if the residents were not watering at least a garden-full of secrets.\n she becomes aware of the hidden, parallel world beneath the mundane. Just beneath the surface of every defunct moment\u2014finding a spot in the supermarket parking lot, waiting at a stoplight\u2014lurks another moment, sexual, adulterous, waiting to be chosen. It shimmers faintly, a phosphorescent arc of lighter fluid ready to catch fire, detectable only to those attuned to it. She parks the car and watches the men and women going in and out through automatic the doors. Which of them are alight, secretly smoldering?\nUnfaithfulness is to be expected. Some marriages are strained, while others, surprisingly, appear to be strengthened by big changes. How about wanting to violate all medical ethics to perform a very strange and intimate act? Maybe show the world the face of a concerned citizen but indulge in a bit of pointed vandalism? There is plenty of imposturing going on here. Maybe parenthood is not for everyone, including some parents? Maybe nurture fears that go well beyond the understandable? A sense of the past permeates as well. There is enough moral ambiguity through the thirteen to spark book group debates aplenty.Unlike Olive Kitteridge, there is no single character serving as a trellis on which the stories can be strung like vines. But there is considerable back and forth. Characters are woven into and out of stories like threads in a tapestry. The author likes to introduce characters in one story and offer us their names elsewhere. Acampora admits that she inserted some of the connective tissue later on in the writing process, says the links \u201cpresented themselves\u201d to her. It is the town itself that is the organizing structure. But there are some elements that repeat. Gardens appear in many of the stories, serving diverse purposes. Another element that struck me was the characterization of the houses of OC as particularly organic. He intends to keep the bones of the house strong and its organs clean for decades to come, even as the skeletons of newer houses rise and fall around it.These machines are the pumping heart of the house; everything else is frivolous and disposable in comparison.The house is gigantic, encrusted with a dark carapace, as if diseased.The exposed oak beams are strong as ribs along the ceiling of the first floor and the central chimney and hearth\u2014spine and heart of the house\u2014exude the smell of ancient smoke.\nAnd there are more like these. On one level, one might even wonder, in a darker vein, whether people inhabit the town or if the town inhabits them. The homes, as might be expected, often reflect the lives of those who live within.The language of the book is at times lyrical and compelling, more effectively so for the pedestrian circumstances in which it shines: \nJohn meets the woman\u2019s eyes again, the crystalline irises with nothing in them but confidence in the universe. He feels nearly dead in comparison, more exhausted by the moment, as if he were being depleted by her presence. It seems that there is a lack of air in this place, that the windows have been sealed shut for decades, since the long-ago children were last measured. A slow moment elapses. In the space of this pause, John feels the breath of the past, the cumulative exhalation of the house and its lost inhabitants. They seem to gather in the basement\u2019s webbed corners, fuzzed with dust and dead skin. It strikes him that this is a last capsule of memory, that when it is swept and painted, the raw floor carpeted and windows unstuck, no trace of life will remain. The history of the house will persist only in the memories of its former residents, those far-flung stewards of dwindling, inexact images.\nThe characters that populate Acampara\u2019s thirteen tales are quite well realized, particularly so, considering the short form involved. The Wonder Garden is a powerful, beautifully written work of fiction. I am sure the horticultural society will approve.Review posted \u2013 6/12/15Publication date \u2013 5/5/2015I received this volume from GR\u2019s First reads program \u2013 thanks guysIt was first recommended to me by my good, much younger, GR pal - Elyse.

The Umbrella Bird in this collection is the primary remaining nugget from that project. Some of the supporting cast from the novel show up in the collection as well.Acampora grew up in Darien, the inspiration for The Stepford Wives, so knows her suburban towns. In visiting Darien as an adult, she found that the houses seemed almost like characters.Here is an audio interview from The Avid Reader. Beware, though. The sound quality is poor, as the host\u2019s volume is way higher than the author\u2019s so you will have to keep turning the volume way up and way down to keep from being knocked out of your seat.The author in an exchange with Lily King on  B&N Here is one complete story from the collection, The Umbrella BirdThe Wonder Garden was an Amazon Book of the Month selection for May, 2015=============================THE STORIESGround Fault - John Duffy is a building inspector with a perceptive eye, and a willingness to let life\u2019s disappointments affect his work.

As a child in Chicago, I remember walking past houses on my block, and making up stories with my friends about what was happening in those houses. This is what these stories are, a personal glimpse behind doors of the people who live on Old Cranbury road. So very interesting because some of the characters,receive multiple points of view, so in some of the stories we see what people think of a certain family and then we are treated to a glimpse of what the actual family is like, by the family themselves.

This book is really a series of episodes about a group of people who live in an upper-middle-class town called Old Cranbury, in New England.It\u2019s difficult to pigeon hole this disparate group of tales. They all focus on different characters, but old faces and connections crop up and by the end I felt I had a pretty good grasp of the inhabitants of this rather posh town. But the overall mood is a uniting force too - to me there was something about the behaviours of the inhabitants that felt just a little \u2018off\u2019. Some of the individuals were a bit eccentric, and the relationships all had a somewhat dysfunctional feel. At times it was like reading a slightly toned down version of Desperate Housewives, alternating with scenes from Twin Peaks and all wrapped up in a town called Camberwick Green (ok, you\u2019d need to be a British child of the 60\u2019s to get the last reference).It all seems to get darker as the book progresses. There are lies and secrets and insecurities here. Yes, the stuff we\u2019re all surrounded by each and every day. So maybe the whole thing isn't any more than a reflection of what goes on in every small town; in every community, in fact. It\u2019s certainly a book that made me think about what is important in life. There are some brilliant lines and each episode is really well crafted. It's hard to pick out my favourites but if pressed I'd go with Afterglow (really wierd and scary) and Moon Roof (I feel like I've enacted that one myself!)Overall it\u2019s really an impressive piece. I\u2019d probably give this 4.5 so I may yet increase my rating, but I\u2019ll leave it at 4 for now and reflect on it a bit \u2013 it\u2019s sure to stay with me for a while."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "Fresh off reading Anthony Marra's brilliant The Tsar of Love and Techno, I jumped into another collection of interrelated short stories, connected by place and characters. Coincidence? Or is this a thing now? Reckon it doesn't much matter if the thing is done well. The Wonder Garden invites inevitable comparisons to Elizabeth Strout's Olive Kitteridge because of the New England setting, and of course the interwoven short stories, but the similarities end there. Strout's connective tissue was Olive, and an irrepressible humanity. Acampora does not tie us to any one character, unless it's David, the advertising exec-turned-mystical healer, and her community of Old Cranberry, CT is far more sinister than Strout's hard-scrabble Maine fishing village. It's not tragic, like Marra's Siberia and Chechnya, trapped in an endless cycle of war and surreal political machinations. No, Acampora writes of a place of enormous privilege and opportunity, the 1%, as it were. Hard to muster much empathy for these folks, in their colonial mansions, set back on wide green lawns, with their \"help\" and country club memberships and Ebel wristwatches. But I don't think Acampora is really after our empathy. She writes, like Margaret Atwood, with delicious, irresistible irony, flirting with the surreal just enough to make us wonder, yet rooting us in a garden we recognize. We nod and snort and generally feel superior to those whose wealth and privilege have always made us slightly ashamed. What strikes me is how little resolution and redemption is found in each story. The endings come abruptly, the characters caught in a moment, and we must leave them there, suspended in time. We are left to wonder, Did they learn anything? Have they changed? And then, suddenly, many pages later, that character reappears in someone else's story, as a minor figure, and we catch a glimpse of what their life is like now, or at least how they are viewed from the outside. It's brilliant really, for the author does not interfere. She doesn't explain or editorialize, she just offers moments of lives and lets us sort it on our own. I thought to highlight individual stories, but that's not why anyone should read this book--it's not that kind of story collection. The Wonder Garden is very nearly a novel, at least this reader read it as such, with the ending of each story feeling more like the ending of a chapter. I couldn't wait to unwrap the next, looking for clues, like a scavenger hunt, wondering how the story would circle back, who I would encounter again. I think it's trite to say that The Wonder Garden shows those whose lives look perfect from the outside face the same quiet desperation the rest of humanity. What I think it shows, in a darkly funny, bitter, and tragic way is how they simply do not. If there is any desperation, it's how to hang on to facade of perfection, while keeping the real world at bay. In a culture where the gap between the have and the have-nots has become a deep canyon, America's Old Cranberry neighborhoods seem more like colonies designed to keep the lepers out and the flawless safe. Lauren Acampora shows us how it's done from the inside out."}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38727943-jenna", "userReview": "Apologies to any Goodreads friends or others whose superlative reviews I may have doubted: you are all correct that this unassuming-looking little book really is That Good!Masterful and nearly flawless, both in each story and as a whole! Acampora's prose is so confident and sure that it's nearly impossible to fathom that this is her first book - and I say this even having recently read many other excellent debut works. Acampora writes like she came into this earth doing it already.Usually, when I write a rave review, on some level I'm still thinking that although *I* really loved a particular book, it may not work for others as well as it worked for me. Not so with this book. It is so near-perfection in concept and execution that it's nearly impossible for me to imagine that other readers of literary fiction won't find it pretty impressive and enjoyable. If I worked at a bookstore or library or other setting where I had people asking me what to read, I'd point them toward this. If this book won an award, instead of being like, \"I guess they had to pick one to be the winner,\" I'd be like, \"Yes. I totally get that.\"And I'm usually really hard on books like this, of the \"dark side of upscale suburbia\" variety. It's such a common and often tired sub-genre, so it takes a lot to convince me why I should care about yet another book of this stripe, or how it might offer something new and interesting to the whole \"something is rotten in upscale Connecticut\" conversation. But Acampora's talent allowed me to easily cast aside any such skepticism. People are right that she possesses a sociologist's level of observational skill which, when combined with her poetic prose, illuminates relevant and fascinating human themes that can transcend the specific setting. It's posh historicized New England, but it's still the human condition.The underlying darkness of this book belies the easy reading. (Although certainly the book is leavened by ample dark humor as well.) We meet characters who have constructed various worldviews, relationships, and identities in attempt to make meaning of their lives -- e.g. History, Patriotism, Community Leader -- only to witness these meaning-making structures collapse around them. Sure, we might scoff at some of the characters' thinking, which often comes across as vain, pedestrian, self-righteous. However, because Acampora is so skilled, she doesn't just take pot shots at her characters and leave them sitting prey to easy scorn. Somehow, they remain somewhat sympathetic, no matter how misguided. As the author stated herself in an interview on \"The Avid Reader\" podcast, it's somehow made clear that the characters are doing the best they can with their (ironically) limited (internal) resources, and that on some level, all the characters have good intentions. It's like reading some more merciful and less creepy Yankee version of Flannery O'Connor that instead of leaving you feeling confirmed that mankind is dumb and pretty much damned, you're left feeling inspired to develop a little more empathy and feelings of grace toward the total asshat on the cellphone who's inexplicably tailgating you.It's worth mentioning that Acampora does a great and NOT overdone or contrived job of creating subtle linkages between some of the stories and characters. This enhances everything and makes the reader do just the right amount of work. It's NOT one of those horrible affairs where everyone in the end Comes Together to stand around staring at the Grand Canyon or some shit, Being As One and marveling at the INTERCONNECTEDNESS.If I had to say two more words that this book is about: Real Estate. But like, in the fullest possible sense. Acampora is amazing at doing the whole \"house (or village) as psyche\" thing: all the characters in this book are buying, selling, expanding, remodeling, designing, furnishing, inspecting, decorating, destroying, preserving -- and even installing avant-garde, vermin-themed art installations onto! -- their houses. And it all means something, and it's fabulous.This is already too long, but I want to give a shout out to some favorite stories to look out for:\"The Umbrella Bird\" - an ultimate \"what if?\" kind of story about an atypical and fascinating midlife crisis of sorts that may leave a partner wishing he'd just gotten the red convertible instead?\"Floortime\" - linked to the above, and one of the best and most original, unsentimental stories I've seen about raising a child with autism - fierce and devastating.\"The Virginals\" - totally amazing and unique story about a far-too-neglected topic in short fiction, and one perhaps way familiar to anyone who's lived in New England or worked at a museum (I have both!): historical reeenactors! Great detailed story about the allure and peril of fetishizing history - with an unexpected creative twist at the end!\"Swarm\" - this is the vermin-themed art installation story - I've already tried to pique your curiosity there, because it's a great story. Poignant and about hubris, I guess - a bit of an Icarus theme. \"The Wonder Garden\" is another story a bit about a family betrayal of sorts stemming from hubris gone way awry...\"Aether\" - moving coming of age and loss of innocence story - about the fruitless search for authenticity in a culture of consumption. \"Sentry\" - another great What If? story that gets at those dark urges and feelings we have when we think we can do something better than someone else - like raise their child... Like the first story \"Ground Fault,\" this is also about human pride, vanity, envy, and small but shocking acts of rebellion that come from coveting what your neighbor has.\"Moon Roof\" - Do you drive around a lot, working and doing errands, with a lot on your mind, and you're tired and unappreciated and people are jerks? If so - you will TOTALLY be able to relate to this story and see it really happening. It needed to be written. I actually can't believe it hasn't been written before. Also a dark comedy, but some won't get that.\"Afterglow\" - creepy story about inappropriate ethics and boundaries while searching for intimacy, knowledge, and mastery of death. A kind of riff on the \"Bride of Frankenstein\" story in a way! These stories have really stayed with me this week after reading them. They are the kind of short stories that know just how to BE a short story, and to end right where it SLAYS you. Where the hell are all these great short stories coming from lately??!"}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne", "userReview": "Really, really well-done collection of interrelated short stories about the inhabitants of Old Cranbury, Connecticut.

Looking from the outside in, we never know about the problems people face, whether their lives are mundane or full of excitement and tension, what their desires and regrets are, and what drives them forward.Lauren Acampora's intriguing, well-written collection of linked stories, \nThe Wonder Garden\n, strives to give us insight into the lives of strangers, as she focuses on the residents of Old Cranbury, a well-heeled suburb not far from Manhattan. From John, the home inspector whose intense attention to detail in his professional life hasn't seemed to translate into his personal life; to Madeleine, whose life is upended when her husband leaves his corporate advertising job to pursue a career as a healer; from Harold, whose fascination with the brain veers into bizarre territory after he forms an alliance of sorts with a surgeon; to Camille, whose frustration with motherhood and life after divorce fuels her desire for a life elsewhere, these stories chronicle hope and disillusionment, happiness and hurt, desires realized and desires thwarted.Acampora does an excellent job creating a sense of a community, and although it's difficult at first to remember which characters were which as they showed up in future stories, once I did, I enjoyed catching another glimpse of them through the lens of another character or situation. Some of the characters are tremendously flawed, some of them are simply caught up in an unexpected or strange situation, and some are just trying to go about their daily lives.Among my favorite stories in the collection were: \"Ground Fault,\" which followed a home inspector whose personal life is more in disarray than his professional one, but some spillage is inevitable; \"Floortime,\" about a woman struggling to reach her autistic son and willing to consider any means to do so; \"Elevations,\" about a couple struggling with the separate needs of each person; \"The Umbrella Bird,\" which chronicles a woman who must reconcile a drastic change in her husband; and \"Moon Roof,\" in which a woman's inability to move into traffic underscores issues in the rest of her life.I really enjoyed this collection and think Acampora is a terrific writer. A few of the stories didn't work for me, either because I found the main character so unlikeable or because I found the premise of the story less interesting, but on the whole this is a really strong collection, and definitely signals the arrival of a fantastic new talent."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "Every single one of these stories was an absolute jewel. When you add to that the fact that the same characters walk through the pages of each one, giving us a view of \"behind closed doors\", and what people do and say in public versus their private thoughts, that gets 5 stars in my book. I loved it from start to finish. Think \"Olive Kitteridge\", but with a neighborhood being the common denominator instead of one person.I will never look at my neighbors again without wondering what is really happening behind those pleasant faces and normal looking families.

Because she IS a good writer and for most part the stories held my attention, but in the end there was no point. Because one pays attention to a story to find out what is going to happen, because you want to know what is going to happen. But these stories are more like character studies than actual stories. You never find out what happens because they just end before any sort of resolution occurs. Some of them jump around in time, but most of them describe a series of events over the course of a day for a character, or even just a few hours. Some of the stories/chapters describe eccentric people, but I wouldn't characterize most of them as weird or scandalous or dark, they are just people who want to have a baby but can't or don't want a baby and their partner does or are cheating on their spouse or realize their spouse is cheating. I thought that the stories might get more interesting as the book progressed but the second to last story was so dull that I started to skim it halfway through. Mild Spoiler Alert (?) -- It is about a woman who is just sitting in her car waiting to make a left turn that she is finding difficult, so she waits and waits and thinks about how she is waiting and going to be late for a party and then she just gives up and naps in the car. WTH? I actually like short stories so my problem with this book wasn't that I don't like short stories. I loved Olive Kitteridge, a book I've seen compared to The Wonder Garden.

I always talk myself into reading short story collections and am invevitably disappointed. They are more character studies than actual stories...just short slices of different lives. Beautifully written, but ultimately unsatisfying.This collection can be summed up with the famous Henry David Thoreau quote: \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation...\" This book delves into the inner turmoil and desperation of seemingly happy suburbanites. The struggles of the residents of this suburb run the gamut from the ordinary (divorce, infidelity,parenthood) to the slightly more odd (woman finds herself unable to make a right turn and just sits at a stop sign and sleeps, woman keeps her neighbor's 4 year old that she finds wandering in the yard)."}, {"userName": "Laurie \u2022 The Baking Bookworm", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5289134-laurie-the-baking-bookworm", "userReview": "My Review: I am, admittedly, not an avid reader of short stories. In fact, this is only the second time I've read a book of short stories - yes, I am a relative newbie to the genre. The previous book of short stories that I read didn't get me too eager to jump on the ol' bandwagon again. I found that I wanted to know more about the characters and was left hanging when they ended. Thankfully, Acampora is a breath of fresh air and has reignited my desire to read more in this genre.Acampora's debut novel stood out for me in a few ways. The writing is crisp, to the point and yet very engaging. She doesn't waste any time with excess descriptions but jumps right into the heart of the issues. But the main thing that impressed me was her unique twist in that all of the characters from thirteen short stories all live in the same quaint, upper scale suburb of Old Cranbury and make appearances in each other's stories. I loved how their lives intersected with each other and enjoyed recognizing characters who were introduced earlier. This helped not only give me a better, overall picture of individual characters but also get a sense of how their issues are viewed by those around them. It gave the book an authentic sense of community (granted a pretty dysfunctional one with all of their issues). And oh boy did these people have issues - their vices, insecurities, worries and problems are revealed to the reader. It has a rather twisted feel to many of the stories yet they are, for the most part, relatable on some level. Or maybe I'm a little twisted. Who's to say?I won't say that all of the short stories engaged me in the same way. I wasn't a fan of a few of them (especially Moon Roof) and sometimes had a hard time remembering which character was which but I definitely had my favourites (ie. Floortime). Overall this book was impressive, oddly relatable in some ways and was a great opportunity to see behind the facades that people put up. Acampora's writing is engaging, descriptive (without being verbose) and her pace kept me interested throughout. She truly has a knack for showing people's need to find connections with each other, to feel understood and accepted all in a very precise and eloquent way.My Rating: 4/5 starsDisclaimer: My sincere thanks to NetGalley and Grove Atlantic for providing me with a complimentary e-book copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.**This book review can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) where I share hundreds of book reviews and my favourite recipes. **"}, {"userName": "Lynne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17408049-lynne", "userReview": "I want to read this book again...

When I browse at bookstores, there are far more books that I want, than I can actually buy, so I keep a list on my iPhone of the ones that catch my interest. Lauren Acampora's short story collection, The Wonder Garden, caught my eye at three different bookstores. It just kept popping up, so I finally caved and bought it.PLOT- In The Wonder Garden, Acampora writes a series of interwoven stories set in the fictional east coast town of Old Cranberry. LIKE- Acampora is a marvelous storyteller. In The Wonder Garden, she floats between the surface of her characters, and their deep, dark secrets. Reading her stories are like watching a film, in that she has a keen sense of when to zoom in and when to pull back her shots. The pacing is pitch perfect.Many of Acampora's characters are creepy, unsettling and highly memorable. In particular, there is a wealthy man with a sick wife, who bribes his wife's brain surgeon, to allow him to touch her brain during surgery. Yikes! The town is filled with historic homes and one couple takes the task of living like they're from the colonial period, clueless as to why their college-aged children don't want to come home for the holidays. They are highly judgmental of their neighbors who do not care as much for preserving the historic properties, especially of a couple who commission an enormous sculpture of insects to run along their front fence. Old Cranberry is a town never short on the bizarre or controversial. DISLIKE- Nothing. Send more stories please. Now. Please? RECOMMEND- Absolutely. You must read The Wonder Garden, Acampora has crafted a collection of affecting and unusual stories. I can't wait to see what she cooks up next. Like my review?

I liked that certain characters popped up in other stories. I wouldn't exactly say the stories overlapped, but there was some popping-up. The only problem with this was that each story was so unique that when some of the less memorable characters reoccurred, I was never 100% sure if I was thinking of the right character or if I was imagining the pop-up. There were certain really good, strong elements of this book and some things that I wish the editor would have weeded out or steered the author in another direction entirely. There were some 5 star stories, but there were some 1 star stories. Since my attention was mainly held throughout the book, I feel like I am able to overlook these poorer offerings and opt for a mostly positive review. I'm going to give this one 4 stars because I did like it, it was mostly interesting, and I think we're going to have some good discussion at our Wednesday book club meeting (so obviously this was a book club pick)."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/854699-brian", "userReview": "In this novel....which reads more like a collection of short stories, we hit upon the inner workings of a small town filled with very odd people who have their own set of secrets. Each chapter focuses on a different character, and as you read through the different points of view, you will encounter some characters that have appeared in other stories as well. This worked for me some of the time, but other times, I forgot who someone was and was a bit confused by it. The stories themselves are what earns this book 4 stars. The tales presented are truly interesting and range from a man with a fascination with the human brain in the unconventional sense, a babysitter who won't let go, a woman who deals with her husband's midlife crisis, among many others.

I am not a fan of short stories, and chose this novel based on the high reviews of several GR friends. I\u2019m glad their reviews caught my eye. Although it\u2019s billed as a short story novel, many of the characters, and their houses, are woven into other stories. If you\u2019ve ever been curious about your town, and wondered what each families/houses \u201cstories\u201d are, this is a great novel for you.The town setting is Old Cranbury in Connecticut. Author Lauren Acampora tells thirteen stories about the inhabitants of the town. Each story is a standalone. Yet each story melds into other stories, as small town household stories meld into other family\u2019s stories.Acampora\u2019s characters are realistic, flawed, and enthralling. The reader is a voyeur into the secret lives of neighbors. Not only is the reader treated to private lives, but also to the internal thoughts and feelings of the characters.This is a character-driven novel, but it\u2019s also introspective. It\u2019s almost a \u201cpassive\u201d read. Acampora\u2019s prose is beautiful. I highly recommend it as a classic study of contemporary small town America."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "I'm sitting here after reading this book and looking at the four and five star reviews that have already been posted.

What happened to the woman who took her? What happened to the gay couple? Did the bullet hit Michael? Although the writing was good, there were so many characters that I couldn't remember who had done what or was with who. This is one book I cannot conscientiously recommend.

The stories are so tightly and deftly woven together that I\u2019m going to write about characters rather than specific stories. These stories take place in the small NYC suburb of Old Cranberry. It is an upper middle class suburb populated mostly by those who work in the city and their spouses. This set of stories spans a longer time period than most short story collections. It is difficult to get an exact number of months, but it seems to be approximately a year.One of my favorite characters is righteous Rosalie. Rosalie is the mother of four, and now she\u2019s taken in an exchange eighth grader from Bangladesh. Her feelings of superiority of her own way of life (Christian, wealthy, American) make her feel that every experience she gives the student is life changing. She has also been elected to the school board despite not having any of the hard budgeting or business skills of the other members. Her husband, Michael, is an interesting character as well. He is a top brain surgeon at the local hospital. He is being blackmailed by a wealthy businessman and is having affairs with a couple of the town\u2019s residents. New residents Madeline and David pop up in more stories than any other couple. He is an advertising executive in NYC and has told her to quit her job in order to raise their first child. They move into a house they can barely afford while she is pregnant. David was raised on a farm and takes to living in suburbia quite readily. Madeline is a little more unsure. She becomes very suspicious when David spends hours every night deep in the backyard building a treehouse for their unborn daughter. This is only the beginning of his transformation.Martin and Philomena are retired and living in a house that has now appreciated to a million dollars, but unlike many of their friends, they have chosen not to sell and move South. Soon new neighbors move into the biggest house on the block. The Gregorys are art collectors from the city. When they find out Martin used to work as an artist and had some shows in famous galleries, they get very excited. The Gregorys commission Martin to do his largest work yet, but he and Philomena pay a steep price for his work.Harris and Mark are one of the least talked about couples in the book, but they made a big impact on me. They own an antique store in Old Cranberry and take in not only the work of local artists and things they buy in the City, but also they travel abroad to bring back exotic items. There is strife in their marriage; Mark wants to live or travel abroad and help people in a Peace Corp-like situations, whereas Harris wants to start a family. In their story, they try to reconcile these differences while Mark takes on a new job.These are just a few of the characters in this fantastic collection. There are so many others including John and Diana, Harold and Carol, Camille and her young daughter, Cheryl and Roger, Suzanne and Brian, Helen and Gene, Lori and Mitch, plus several of these couples\u2019 teenage children. There are secrets and betrayals in this small suburban town. The residents have a knack for getting in trouble. I highly recommend this collection."}, {"userName": "Tara - Running 'n' Reading", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22612431-tara---running-n-reading", "userReview": "I've not been truly enthralled by a collection of short stories since Tenth of December by George Saunders; however, author Lauren Acampora has definitely brought the magic back for me! If you are a fan of somewhat dark, borderline \"weird\" tales that take place in the most unsuspecting environments (suburbia, for example), then you MUST read this collection. I can guarantee that there will be times when you finish one of these stories and you find yourself leaning back in your seat, saying, \"Whoa.\" I mean that in the best way possible.I don't want to spoil any of the fun for you, but I will say that the stories include many different types of characters: young and old, wealthy and not-so-wealthy, single parents, married couples, artists, doctors, \"spiritual healers;\" I was blown away by the manner in which Acampora gently weaves them together throughout the collection. The only thing the characters truly have in common is the neighborhood in which they live; you may look at your neighbors differently after reading. While the stories certainly kept me interested, Acampora's writing is magnificent; her descriptions of this area, the architecture and the people were both provocative and delightful. I could have kept reading much more and was sad to reach the end of the final story. For those of you who end up reading this one, I will tell you as someone who works in a hospital my favorite story was \"Afterglow;\" I guess you're going to have to read it now to find out why!Short story collections are wonderful because they are easy to pick up and put down; I never feel tied to any sort of deadline because I know the stories will be there in their disconnected-but-connected way.

The stories present the hidden disappointments, obsessions, and insecurities that lurk amidst the tranquil tree-lined facade of a small upscale community known as Old Cranbury.Lauren Acampora's writing is lyrical and precise as she explores the recesses of her characters' hearts and minds. Several of the characters appear in one or more other stories, revealing the different faces they present in different situations, but also creating the sense of an interlaced community of people, each trying to come to terms with their place in the family, the neighborhood, the planet.My favorite story in the collection is \"Moon Roof\" in which a woman on her way home from an errand is at a stop sign wanting to turn left. At first the traffic prevents her from turning, but gradually she realizes she cannot take her foot from the brake; she finds herself frozen, unable to advance to her home or the party she had expected to attend. She comes to realize, as she sits for hours at the stop sign, how marginalized she feels by her husband and sons and how much she would like to escape her future.These sorts of mental meanderings make this book delightful to read and in fact invite a second reading."}, {"userName": "Brett Beach", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28628579-brett-beach", "userReview": "Wanted more from this collection.

But the stories are expected and hit on their themes (unhappiness, malaise, adultery, etc.) without truly surprising. Also, Acampora's use of metaphors can overly complicate an image, for instance, a brain is described as \"wet and gelatinous, like a custard.\" The first description is pretty wonderful and evocative; I'm not sure what the custard adds.

Darkness brews beneath the perfect surface of the community's manicured lawns, winding roads, and colonial facades, and no one is really who they appear to be.

It may be that I am from the area on which Acampora has based Old Cranbury, and thought she did a spectacular job describing the people and the environment I grew up in. More than that, though, I felt that she did an amazing job at capturing the inner lives of her characters. The stories were linked in subtle ways, and realizing all of the things that the characters almost tragically didn't know about each other was incredibly affecting. There is also one story that is hands down one of the best stories I feel like I've ever read. All that happens is that a character sits at an intersection, but there is so much more than that.
