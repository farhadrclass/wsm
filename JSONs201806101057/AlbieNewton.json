Well that is Albie Newton! Albie is a child genius from the day he was born. When he went to a new elementary school he wanted very badly to make some new friends so he came up with an idea. His plan is to make a very special invention for his classmates. Unfortunately, he gets so self-absorbed in what he is doing that he doesn't realize that he is causing mayhem in the classroom. Thank goodness Shirley gave Albie the benefit of the doubt and stopped the riot that was about to happen. When they saw what Albie had created, they were amazed and let their imagination run wild.Albie Newton is such a precious book! Kids will love the rhyming verses and the illustrations are just so much fun! This is a great book to read to all ages and the discussions that can come from it are endless.

Visit us for new picture books reviews daily!Hello, friends! Our book today is Albie Newton, written by Josh Funk and illustrated by Ester Garay, the story of a boy genius and his classmates learning how to be friends.Albie isn\u2019t quite like other kids. When he learned his numbers, he cried because he couldn\u2019t count to infinity. He likes to learn a new language every week: English, Spanish, Hindi \u2013 even Klingon! Still, Albie is a friendly and happy young man, and excited to start his first day at a new school. When he hears his new classmates sing their morning song about friendship, Albie decides that he will invent a special gift to ingratiate himself to the others. Unfortunately, while Albie is obviously quite brilliant, he lacks social skills, and his habit of taking things without asking and overshadowing others with his work begins to upset the other children. But classmate Shirley convinces other kids to be patient with Albie \u2013 he means well, he just thinks differently. And sure enough, by day\u2019s end, Albie has built them a gift that is astoundingly one-of-a-kind.I liked this a lot. Albie does indeed do things that are generally perceived as rude. But the thing is, as smart as Albie is, he doesn\u2019t understand that what he\u2019s doing is unacceptable \u2013 he\u2019s just trying to make a nice gift for his new friends. To me, this reads as an allegory for children with ASD or social/developmental disorders, and an effective one at that. It\u2019s a good way of encouraging children with these disorders to consider how others may perceive their actions, and encourages children without them to be patient with their friends who may think or act differently from them. The illustrations are adorable and charming, and filled with clever details. The length was great, JJ enjoyed it, and we\u2019re definitely calling this one Baby Bookworm approved!(Note: A copy of this book was provided to The Baby Bookworm by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)Be sure to check out The Baby Bookworm for more reviews!"}, {"userName": "Michele Knott", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5915836-michele-knott", "userReview": "What a great book to share with young readers - I like that Albie is different from his peers and that doesn't change. This reflects what we see in classrooms and schools and although the kids perspective may not change, they can appreciate what Albie creates."}, {"userName": "Jillian Heise", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100422-jillian-heise", "userReview": "A fabulous story in rhyming verse about Albie, a tinkerer and thinker, who is so focused on his inventions that he doesn't often notice what's happening with the other kids in his class or how his actions affect them. Luckily, one of the girls in his class pays attention and notices Albie and what he's working on, leading to a revelation at the end. This will be a fantastic picture book to read with kids to help build empathy and understanding of all personalities. ETA: The final version is bright and colorful and so fun! *review from an early non-color manuscript print out - eager to see the final version as the illustrations look to be adorable!"}, {"userName": "Caitlin Zonder", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11271520-caitlin-zonder", "userReview": "Loved this book about Albie! Albie is incredibly smart, at least book wise. He may need some help with his social skills though . This will be a great book to use to help kids become more empathetic."}, {"userName": "Aliza Werner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11936822-aliza-werner", "userReview": "Albie is quite the inventor, but he's not always one to notice the reactions of those around him."}, {"userName": "Tonja Drecker", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11118704-tonja-drecker", "userReview": "Through whimsical rhyme, this is a fun tale about being different as well as accepting those who are different themselves.Albie Newton's extraordinary traits make him into quite the amazing kid. . .until he hits Kindergarten. His ideas and creations stick out so much that the other kids aren't sure what to think of him. He hopes to win them over with an amazing creation, but ends up making them more upset without even realizing it. Luckily, one little girl realizes what is happening. The results are unexpected and tons of fun.The title alone had us smiling, and it's clear from the get-go that this is going to be about a very smart kid. Albie is a little genius, and the first pages hit on this with tons of fun as he does amazing things and builds contraptions kids wish they could do themselves. The rhymes add to the excitement, flowing seamlessly. They're fun to read and bring across the situations nicely.Colorful illustrations follow along and add to the emotions and fun. It's easy to follow these alone and get a handle on the story. There's enough detail to draw readers to flip through these again and again.It's obvious that Albie isn't fitting in and is different from the other kids. His desire to be accepted touches the heart, and the kids are unsure what to do with him. They keep to themselves. This, however, is not a story about bullying or being shut out. Instead, Albie is in his own world and doesn't realize that he's not really pulled into the community. He's happy in his inventive world, trying to build a wonderful present for his new classmates.This is a story of acceptance and recognizing others' differences, and seeing past them. This message is brought across clearly and easy for even younger readers to understand, especially showing how well everyone can get along if they're willing to forgive and give friendship a try. But my children noticed something else\u2014not only is Albie a whiz-kid, but he doesn't realize what his actions do to those around him as he destroys toys and takes things away from the others without ever recognizing the problem in doing this. As a mother of 'special children' who sometimes have a problem with empathy, this message doesn't hit quite right. Still, there's a lot of inspiration in the girl who sees past it all and keeps disaster from happening.Still, it's a lovely book and one full of invention, imagination and fun. The message is a little mixed but still hits a good direction kids will be able to understand.I received a complimentary copy and enjoyed it enough to want to leave my honest thoughts."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30663476-jennifer", "userReview": "Albie Newton is a boy genius-inventor-classmate who is always thinking and creating, much to the dismay of his peers. When Albie moves to a new school in the middle of the year, he wants to make new friends, so he spends his time inventing something amazing (instead of playing with the others).Well, after Albie dumps the garbage can and steals the wheel from the hamster cage, the class notices that he\u2019s tearing up the room. \u201cBut Albie didn\u2019t notice all the problems he was causing. Focused on important things, he never thought of pausing.\u201d When the kids form an \u201cangry mob\u201d to confront the pest, Shirley (a girl who sees Albie differently) comes to Albie\u2019s defense.Maybe it takes effort to make friends, and what IS acceptable effort? Albie\u2019s actions may get him into trouble, but at the end of the day, do his actions lead to friendships? Read Albie Newton and find out. Make sure you look carefully at all the illustrations by Ester Garay, too.

But Albie doesn\u2019t miss a beat. With rollicking, rhyming text and humorous digital illustrations, readers quickly come to know that Albie is an exceptional child. At first readers, and the other kids in this preschool class, have the impression that Albie has many social skills to learn: waiting his turn, asking others before he just starts grabbing things, etc. But before they get all bent out of shape with him, young readers will see what happens when the kids in the class stop to see what he\u2019s working on, ask questions about it, and get to know this wonderful person who is so eager to contribute to the classroom community. This would be a terrific book to share with young readers to remind them how to treat each other kindly and build relationships, especially with new students."}, {"userName": "Julie Kirchner", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33400318-julie-kirchner", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this new book by Josh Funk!

How many of us can relate to that or have had one of those kids in our classrooms? Albie could have easily been misunderstood and the kids in his class could have just turned away from him. But it only takes one to make a difference, to change the course. I loved that this classroom of children recognized that there was more to Albie than his mess-making and disasters. They were willing to look past that and get to know him. My classroom loved this book and could easily connect to all of the characters and their feelings. This book was an instant success in my classroom."}], "description": "Meet Albie Newton: child genius. He\u2019s a whiz at inventing things.
