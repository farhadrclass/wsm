A Certain Slant of Light was one of my favorite reads in recent memory, a slow, sad ghost story with a literary style and questionable ethics. Helen's choices left Jenny in an unimaginably difficult situation, however, and I wasn't sure whether the author could convince me that this wrong could be righted without losing the integrity of the first book.I'm happy to say that I needn't have worried. This sequel is astonishingly complete and wholly satisfying in how it resolves both Jenny and Helen's journeys, and in the way it gives us a truly transportive experience in Jenny and Billy's tentative relationship. I wasn't sure I would be swayed by a pairing that started under such unusual circumstances, but the yearning, uncertain romance made me thrill with their connection and wish fervently for their happiness.I don't want to say too much about the specifics of this story, because the less you know about it, the better. But Under the Light is full of love and beauty, as well as a deep and tender spiritualism that outshines even its predecessor. The writing is the kind that I live and breathe for--it takes you out of your body because it's so utterly gorgeous.\nThe night was deep, the stars had risen, a faint glow defined every blade of grass. Wasn't it strange that the stars sparkled in his eyes even though he would not cast an image in a mirror himself?\nThis two-book series isn't for everyone, because while the stories are short, they are densely fitted with words and mature themes. But if you're someone who appreciates literary YA, I'd strongly recommend this series. Just know you'll need to keep an open mind...but also know that it may lift your heart and imagination to places that you would never have expected.5 shining stars.

It appears that even I, a reader with a very short memory for details, have my limits. If a sequel verges on being 50% recap of its preceding story, then what's the point of its existence, really?I remember A Certain Slant of Light to be a lovely, elegant, sensual and gently unsettling ghost story. (It's been years since I read it though, in fact, it was one of my first YA reads after, naturally, Twilight, so I can't be held fully accountable for my memories of it until I reread it, ok?) Under the Light is equally elegantly written. Laura Whitcomb published books on writing and indeed she knows what she is talking about, her prose is lovely, in my opinion. The last chapter is just gorgeous. But the plot, the plot! Where art thou?The premise of Under the Light is that we follow up on Jenny and Billy once their bodies, previously possessed by Helen and James, are returned to them. A Certain Slant of Light left Jenny and Billy in quite a bind (possibly a pregnancy? ooh-la-la!), so I see how it would be interesting to see how they deal with their difficulties and with the realization that their bodies were inhabited and used by ghostly lovers. But so much of this new novel is taken up by Helen, who in this book returns to see Jenny through her ordeal, and Helen's recapping of what she and James did in the previous book, that there is hardly any space in this rather slight tome left to develop Jenny and Billy's story. This book thoroughly lacks in new material and good conflict. There are almost no new revelations or new developments. Jenny and Billy finding out what happened to their bodies? But WE already know! Any new stories with Jenny's parents? Hardly! Getting to know Billy a bit better? Eh, a bit. It seems, everything exciting happened in the first book, and this follow-up just ties some loose ends, and barely offers anything more. We do learn about Billy's reasons for abandoning his body, however this plot line is fairly insignificant and short. The way I see it, the novel would have been better if Helen weren't in it at all. She is fairly useless as a helper anyway.In the end, the only thing that Under the Light achieves is make you want to reread A Certain Slant of Light. I recommend you all do the same and don't bother with this companion. I feel that A Certain Slant of Light is a better book if it is experienced as a standalone."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/297700-shannon", "userReview": "Woaaaah.

A Certain Slant of Light is one of my all time favorite books, as well as one of my most beloved Young Adult reads. This is a book you find yourself re-reading time and again, and will want to pass it along to anyone you know. The story is so beautiful, the writing poetic. This is a book that makes you cry because of the message about love and life and death. Under the Light should impressed fans of A Certain Slant of Light, but it didn\u2019t pack as much of a punch like A Certain Slant of Light, although the writing is still rich and full or prose.Under the Light begins right after A Certain Slant of Light ends. Helen, the spirit who possessed Jenny's body, the depressed and sad girl, for a week has left and found peace in what looks to be Heaven. While in Jenny\u2019s body, Helen met another spirit James, who possessed Billy\u2019s body. Jenny comes from a very strict, religious household, while Billy lives with his older brother and gets in trouble with the law. Over a course of a week, Helen and James connected and fell in love. Unfortunately when they left the bodies they took over, both Jenny and Billy are then clueless as to what happened during that week their souls were away. Their souls were on another plane where they met and also connected, much like Helen and James did. Now that Jenny and Billy have returned, they must figure out what they missed and the consequences, if any, of Helen and James\u2019s actions.Jenny finds out her father has been cheating on her mother and left for his mistress. This comes as complete shock because Jenny\u2019s father is very a bible thumping, religious fanatic who ruled his household with an iron fist. Jenny is very confused and scared. But she\u2019s not alone. Helen has come back to Jenny to help her find peace, much like she has found. Then there\u2019s Billy, who wants to stay friends with Jenny. Both team up and investigate the time they\u2019ve lost. Helen is there the entire time to guide Jenny, who feels Helen is helping her, especially when it comes to her father and those at the church who believe Jenny was possessed by a demon.Laura Whitcomb has a lovely way with words. Under the Light is a precious tale about forgiveness and acceptance. Jenny and Billy are total opposites but have a bond now because of Helen and James. Under the Light is also very sweet and tender and suited for all ages. It\u2019s the perfect book for teens feeling lost or uncertain about their own lives. Under the Light gives you a sense of hope. The ending will make you smile and possibly shed a tear.I loved reading about Helen again, although I wish James was by her side as she helped Jenny. I\u2019m hoping there will be one final book showing Helen and James together in their paradise they have made for themselves. Under the Light was like coming home to old friends.Do yourself a favor and pick up A Certain Slant of Light and Under the Light. You won\u2019t regret it."}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1894085-alexa", "userReview": "My review can also be found on my blog Collections.I remember adoring A Certain Slant of Light and loving the way it ended. However, I did have some lingering questions: What exactly were Jenny and Billy up to while they were away from their bodies? Was Jenny really pregnant? And most importantly, what happened to Jenny and Billy afterwards? When I heard the author was writing a novel about them I was ecstatic! At the same time, I wondered if these questions would be answered at all and if the story would even be as amazing as the first book. Having read it now, though, I realize I had nothing to worry about. Laura Whitcomb truly delivered beyond anything I could have ever hoped for in this follow up to A Certain Slant of Light. Under the Light was a dream come true for me. The entire book was just as mesmerizing and breathtaking as its predecessor, if not more. It flowed so well and gave me the same wonderful feelings I had while reading the first book. These were my thoughts as soon as I finished: 'Wow. Could a sequel be any more perfect?' I really couldn't have asked for a better outcome for Jenny and Billy and Helen.Although this novel focused on Jenny and her relationship with Billy and her family, Helen was also an integral character. She might have had her happy ending, but she ended up coming back to Jenny's world out of guilt. She wanted to make sure Jenny didn't suffer the consequences of her actions while she was in Jenny's body, so protecting and looking after Jenny until her life got back on track became Helen's main goal in the book. It wasn't always easy for Helen to communicate with Jenny though. Some moments I wished she could get through to Jenny quickly, other moments I was relieved she couldn't interfere. Overall, I was just glad Helen was there by Jenny's side to guide her and to witness everything Jenny had to go through to reach her own happy ending.For me, Jenny and Billy were the stars of Under the Light. Whenever they had moments together, I smiled like crazy. Their interactions with each other were done so perfectly. Once they figured out ghosts had inhabited their bodies, they retraced the steps the ghosts had taken in their bodies. It was great because there was a sweet awkwardness between them. They knew something special had happened, but it was hard for them to understand why they were important to each other. It was very adorable to read. I couldn't get enough.The questions I mentioned before about Jenny and Billy were addressed, of course, and the answers were unexpected and surprising in a really good way. I loved learning more about their lives, especially Billy's, even though his story broke my heart to pieces. It made me even more thankful that they found each other because the bond they shared kept them both anchored during the hardships they faced. I just LOVED how their relationship developed. It was such a beautiful thing. There's so much more I could say, really. I can't quite find the words, though, to describe how amazing it was to read about them. But I will say that I don't think Jenny and Billy fans will be disappointed at all.Under the Light was a highly satisfying and emotional conclusion to the stories of Helen, Jenny, and Billy, all of which began in A Certain Slant of Light. It left me feeling happy and content, the way I love to feel when I finish a novel. I honestly wish it never had to end. Not because I thought it needed more, but because I couldn't quite bring myself to let these characters go. I hope fans of A Certain Slant of Light love Under the Light as much as I did. It's a worthy sequel and deserving of all the praise it will no doubt receive.P.S.

But also, we got to know where they've been while outside of their bodies. The duel narration between Jenny and Helen was annoying. I would have preferred it be just Jenny's story like the first book was just Helen's story. Helen was just trying to help Jenny after making a disaster of Jenny's life.

After reading A Certain Slant of Light and like so many others, wondering what will happen to Julie and Billy. Well, the answers are here.I was surprised at first that the voices were Helen and Julie. I anticipated the second voice would be Billy's, but should have known better as Whitcomb is smarter than that. She doesn't do the expected, not in her writing or in her storytelling.Julie and Billy both have large gaps in their memories from their spirits leaving their bodies and those bodies then being temporarily taken over by Helen and James, two ghosts.While I would strongly suggest you read ACSoL prior to reading this one, you can enjoy it even without doing so. But, again, I'd recommend reading it because it will make this one a bit easier to read, more understandable and most importantly, it is one fabulous read.What I loved best about this book is the growth of the characters. Both Billy and Julie are confused by the fact that they know each other, but don't remember each other. And their actions prior to leaving their bodies and the actions of their bodies while they were gone, could have lasting consequences for their lives.My one small complaint and the reason this one is a four and a half stars instead of five is the very last chapter with Helen's thoughts. It is either so esoteric or metaphysical that it was too whack-a-doodle for me. What if this hadn't happened or time can be spooled up and re-arranged. Truly so far over my head that my reaction was, huh? And I don't feel it adding anything and was just plain weird.

Now, a good 8 years later, I like to think that I am because I really enjoyed Under the Light. Same breathtakingly gorgeous writing, same aching emotion to every aspect of the plot, but now a lot more emphasis on the character development than on the romance, which was still beautiful anyway.

It doesn't come as much of a surprise that Billy is the boy from the meadow. But ultimately, for me, they never became the same person. They just seemed so very different--the boy from the meadow was full of life, cocky and angry but also eloquent and sure of himself. Billy in real life was never that person for me. He was sullen, awkward, and his intelligence was insulted at several points. I think this last point was to make sure we know, for sure, that Billy is not James. At one point, James, as Billy, wrote a poem about Helen, and, to make it more credible that he was Billy, he misspelled a single word (\"sacrid\" for \"sacred\"). To which Jenny comments, \"'Smart boy.'\" Not what I would have gone for, but okay. I didn't have a problem with real-life Billy, but I never really got a feel for any growth of his character.

Most of the time, you discover series you love and blow through them at lightning speed and then are left to pick up the shattered pieces of yourself when the whole glorious thing is over. Or you stumble across gold with the very first book and are forced to not-so-patiently wait one year (or more) for each new installment. But occasionally an author hits you with one out of left field. I first read and adored A Certain Slant of Light not too long after it was published in 2006. It felt like a perfectly contained standalone novel to me at the time. And it still is. If you only read that one, you will be left content. But there are a couple of . . . I hesitate to call them side characters . . . that you certainly would not object to spending more time with, if you know what I mean (series addicts: I know you know what I mean.) So when I discovered that Laura Whitcomb was writing a companion novel (sequel of sorts) told from one of those character's perspectives, well. I was more than okay with it.Jenny is not okay. Having returned to her body after unexpectedly vacating it for a period of time, she has no real recollection of what happened in the interim. All she knows is that she was . . . gone . . . for awhile. And when she came back, there was a boy who seemed to know her but not know her. Billy held in his hand a Polaroid of the two of them together. They looked happy. They looked like they belonged together. And yet Jenny and Billy do not know each other. They don't have the kind of shared memories that the photograph suggests. Instead, what they have is a disturbingly similar (if different in the details) history of shame, painful family issues, and a longing for escape. And, as it turns out, Billy was gone for awhile, too. What they begin to discover is that a fair bit happened while they were away. And one of the presences involved is not through involving herself in their lives. Meanwhile, real life has gone on around them. Jenny's father has moved out and is threatening (as he always has) to control everything about her life. Billy's brother is suspicious (as he always is) of his little brother's activities. The two lost teens attempt to get to know one another and, perhaps, puzzle out their bizarre connection. But it seems the ramifications of the events they have no memory of will impede their fledgling attempts and impact their presents in very real and unsettling ways.And that's where every ghost story begins, with a death.Laura Whitcomb uses all her words and that is all there is to it. It was so comforting (and not a little emotional) to be back inside the beautiful canopy of language she creates. Somehow she manages to return us to that absolutely unique atmosphere evoked in A Certain Slant of Light, and it is as though we were never away. Helen is a point of view character this time around as well, and it was easy to fall back into the cadence of her thoughts. But since I felt her story resolved nicely in the last book, Jenny was the one I really wanted to be with. So it proved to be somewhat of a distraction when Helen's presence in the story occasionally threatened to overwhelm Jenny's. I fully understood her preoccupation with Jenny's fate, but I could have done with a little less from her directly. Because when Helen fades into the background and allows us an unfettered view of Jenny and Billy together . . . it is magnetic. As in the final chapter of A Certain Slant of Light, the bond between these two is breathtakingly tentative. I would have followed them anywhere they wanted to go. And Whitcomb does take them places, beyond the boundaries of time and space, in fact. A favorite passage that takes place fairly early on and far, far away:He lifted his foot and rested it over my ankle, gently pinning me down.Then he pointed into the heavens. \"Want to go there?\"\"Where?\"\"That star.\" He gave his finger an extra stretch toward the dozens of stars in that general direction. \"The one by those other two stars.\"\"What do you mean?\" I lifted my arm so it was touching his, our hands and fingers aligned, and pointed. \"That one?\"\"No,\" he complained. Then he swiped his fingers across our view of the sky, like he was flicking away a speck of dust or a drop of water, and the night surged forward. The stars, staying perfectly aligned, curved across the sky--time had sped into the future an hour.I gasped at this and grabbed his hand, pulling it back toward our bodies as if he might accidentally throw the earth off its rotation. The stars slowed again, appearing to have stopped.\"How did you do that?\" I whispered.\"I took us somewhere we hadn't been yet,\" he said. \"Forward in time.\"He said it so matter-of-factly, but the idea made me shiver on the inside.\"Just a little,\" he reassured me.\"Thats . . . so cool.\" I pointed at one particularly bright star and gave it a push with my fingertip in the air. The map of stars glided forward again, constellations staying aligned as they gracefully passed over us, not a long way, just a bit into the tail of the night, an hour or two closer to morning.He made a sound of alarm, a fake cry, and then laughed, \"Here.\" He lifted his arm to mind, our hands together, our index fingers pointing up. As one, without saying aloud what we would do, we moved the stars a few minutes westward, then froze. \"Look what we can do together,\" he said.And so while the story spends a rather unnecessary amount of time detailing Helen's anxieties and desires for her former host, it redeems itself by winding its way around again to the heart of this sequel--two shell-shocked and lonely young people who find each other and, in each other, hope."}, {"userName": "Tabitha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4446517-tabitha", "userReview": "Under the Light is actually a companion novel to Laura Whitcomb\u2019s book A Certain Slant of Light. It is totally not necessary for you to have read it in order to read this one. While yes this one literally does pick up within minutes after the other book ends \u2013 this one is instead focused on two young teens named Jenny and Billy.Finding each otherJenny has a really rough home life. Her parents are so religious and her father so strict about everything that one day after throwing away so many of Jenny\u2019s precious personal belongings Jenny snaps and her spirit leaves her body and she floats about the world experiencing everything she can while leaving her body as what she believes to be an empty shell. But unbeknownst to her Helen (the ghost from A Certain Slant of Light) occupies her body for a very short time and uses her body for her own ends with another ghost, James who has occupied another empty body (Billy\u2019s body).Billy has it just as rough as Jenny does. While he doesn\u2019t have fanatically religious parents he has absentee ones. His father is in jail for beating his mother into a vegetative state and his mother is in the hospital. He\u2019s fallen in with the wrong crowd and to try to escape his life he turns to drugs and somehow ends up detaching his spirit from his body. While he\u2019s away he\u2019s occupied by the ghost James.Now the period of \u201coccupation\u201d by the ghosts is what is covered in A Certain Slant of Light and while it does have an effect on Jenny and Billy when they return to their bodies, as I said you don\u2019t need to have read that book to be able to follow along with this one. It was definitely enjoyable and more of a crossover adult read whereas this one is a young adult read. So if it sounds appealing I would recommend it.While Jenny and Billy are aware from their bodies they happen to meet in spirit and become close but when they are thrust back into their bodies neither one of them can remember exactly the time they spent out of their bodies. But they do have evidence that the two of them have had a relationship that they both can\u2019t remember. Slowly they start to piece this together while navigating their tumultuous lives and problems.I have to admit emotions ran high for me when it came to Jenny\u2019s side of the story. The book is told completely from her and Helen\u2019s perspective as Helen has decided to stay on earth to try and protect Jenny from any harm she may have caused while she had occupied her body. Jenny has it really rough as her parents are now getting a divorce and her mother is not being a very good supportive parent (not that she ever was to begin with). I also have a very hard time whenever fanatical religion comes into play when I\u2019m reading. It\u2019s a subject that makes me uncomfortable to read and I know this directly effect my enjoyment level of the book. But I think this was supposed to be an emotional book and it definitely succeeded at wringing the emotions from me. There was a lot of self discovery and a bit of coming of age for both Jenny and Billy (though you really learn more about Jenny since we don\u2019t get Billy\u2019s perspective). They are both so young and have gone through so much and seeing how those circumstances shape them and yet they are still good people and the choices they make is a really fabulous thing to see.While it was a sad read it also comes with a message of hope and I believe imparts a message to teens that they do still have power over their lives. It\u2019s definitely a book I would recommend to any young teen."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3082444-candace", "userReview": "It's been years since I read A Certain Slant of Light and I found myself being concerned about whether I would be confused with this book. I remember only a few things about it, but as I read Under the Light I began to remember A Certain Slant of Light and it all came back to me. Initially I didn't remember who Jenny was, but she's the one who's body Helen took in A Certain Slant of Light. So it's more her story, but Helen is still present and tells a bit from her side as well. Jenny's family is super religious and her spirit was being broken by her father. He read her diary and then took everything important to her away. This is where Helen comes in. So we see where Jenny went when out of her body but a good portion of the story is when she comes back and how things play out with Jenny and Billy (who was Helen's lover but whose body was taken by another ghost) and how they have this thing that connects them but they don't remember each other. It's also about Jenny and her family. Her super religious and over the top father and the mother who is lost herself but only knows one thing, religion. I liked Jenny a lot and really felt bad for her. I wanted her to stand up for herself and find her way and we got to see that happen. It was slow, she didn't change over night, but she found her footing and found her voice. She ended up being very strong. We also get to know Helen's past and how she died, which was very interesting and I was glad to know more about her.I really love the concept of ghosts in these books and think that the author did a great job of making it all very believable. I believe in ghosts and have interacted with them myself, so this was something I did connect with.Laura Whitcomb has a very lyrical writing style. It's more along the literary lines of things, which I don't usually like, but quite liked in this book. The story was easy to read and once I got into the rhythm of it I didn't put it down once. I read nearly the entire thing before bed and didn't stop reading until I finished. While this is a companion novel and you don't have to read the first book, I do encourage you to do so. You'll understand things much better and you'll enjoy it more as things regarding Helen will make much more sense. I very highly recommend this series to fans of YA books with ghosts (not scary) and contemporary since the contemporary theme was very important in this one.

It's one of my favorite YA fantasy reads ever. In fact, that's the one YA paranormal/fantasy book that I measure all of the other YA paranormal romance books to. I found it beautifully written and completely captivating. While I did like Under the Light, I sort of feel as though it falls a bit short of the wonderfulness that is A Certain Slant of Light.A Certain Slant of Light is Helen's story. And I really loved Helen. However, Under the Light is more Jenny's story. And while I found Jenny's backstory satisfying considering that I have a thing for angst, I wasn't much enchanted by Jenny as I was by Helen. While I didn't find Under the Light to be slow-going at all, I never found myself entirely engrossed in the chapters that were told from Jenny's point of view...at least not the way I was when I was reading the chapters narrated by Helen. Again, I love Helen. Loved her in A Certain Slant of Light and found that even though, she was more supporting character this time around, she was still eternally complex. Her struggles for wanting to do right by Jenny and yet be with James was what ultimately had me hooked.Oh, and what was up with that ending? I won't spoil it here...mostly because I have no idea what the hell happened. I don't get it. I'm tempted to just pretend that it didn't happen because I don't understand it.Overall, I found Under the Light to be a pretty okay read. It's as beautifully written as A Certain Slant of Light is, it's just that when you put those two side by side, A Certain Slant of Light leaves Under the Light in the dust. I agree with the reviewer who said that what Under the Light does is give you this intense urge to reread A Certain Slant of Light. I say, if anything, read it just to give you more \"I want to give Helen a big ole' hug\" feels."}, {"userName": "Carie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187401-carie", "userReview": "[a Helen and James reunion and not that crazy, abstract, unclear ending  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Sara Grossaint", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2005163-sara-grossaint", "userReview": "When I first read A Certain Slant of Light I didn't know how quickly entangled and invested I would become in the afterlives of Helen and James in such a short amount of time and pages and the same goes for this book.Upon learning that there would be a sequel to one of my favorite books, I was definitely skeptical, but when I found that we were going to be delving into the aftermath of Billy's and Jenny's lives, I was much more excited; Whitcomb didn't disappoint. I adored each word, just as I did with its predecessor.My only complaint was that Helen's involvement was irrational and discomforting. I felt as if her story was tied up in a perfect, neat red bow, leaving A Certain Slant of Light a gift for any reader. If Whitcomb had stayed only with Jenny's point of view for this book, I feel like I would have enjoyed the story a lot more. However, I still adored the whole book. The writing was lovely and lilting and the end left me craving slice after slice after slice of this beautiful, complicated, realistic, heartbreaking, perfect story. It's stories like this that make me happy to be alive, to be a human, to be a person."}, {"userName": "Stefanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5276878-stefanie", "userReview": "The first book didn't need a sequel, but Whitcomb's writing is lovely so I read this anyway.It was boring. There was none of the tension or passion from the first book. And the turnaround of Billy to a sweetheart just to further the plot and make Helen feel better was pretty nauseating. None of the unanswered questions from the first book (did Jenny get an STD from Billy because of Helen and James, for example) get answered in this one, so most of it is a lot of navel-gazing.Whitcomb is still a lovely writer.
