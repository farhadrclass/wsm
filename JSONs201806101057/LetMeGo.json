Six years!, minor crimes?, what went on within the walls of Birkenau can hardly be seen as minor. OK, so she was only a guard, and nowhere near as bad as some of the other monsters who carried out mass killings. But selecting women prisoners for brothels, tearing screaming children away from their mothers, rifle butting, assisting in ghastly experiments, and on the whole, showing absolutely no remorse whatsoever for her role in the final solution looks pretty bad to me. She should have received a far more severe sentence. So, it's 1998, and after a 30 year wait, in which she discovered her mother's dark past, an older Helga received a letter asking to visit her 90 year-old mother, Traudi, now residing in a nursing home and in poor health. Traudi, during the war, cruelly abandoned her two young children, Helga and Peter, to join the SS, believing totally in the extermination of the Jews. Once the two finally meet, her mother cunningly first denies ever having children, but comes around, and vividly recounts to her daughter the horrors that played out during the time with the SS, and the reasons for walking out on her family. They talk, one in disbelief, the other in stubborn pride. I suppose Helga was looking for some sort of apology after all these years, not just for her children, but all those exterminated. Forget it. Once a Nazi, always a Nazi. She may have been half dead, with a sunken face, poor eyesight, and rancid breath, but this old hag clearly still had SS blood pumping through her knackered veins. She was, quite frankly, despicable. I would have thrown her out the window.Whilst Helga listened on, Traudi's face would light up when going into details on her disgust for the Jews, she practically blamed them for just about anything and everything. You would think at 90 years-old, a softer side may have emerged, being the final time she would get to see her offspring, but there wasn't much to say about any positives in the outcome. Helga really was torn between hating her mother and feeling sorry for her. Did she find a place in her heart to forgive?, by the end it's difficult to tell.Although dealing with some powerful themes, for me, the book read far too much like a novel. Her mother was no doubt playing around with her marbles upstairs, and I took pity on how painful this must have been for Helga, but on an emotional level I was left feeling a little empty. It's no doubt carried with a heart rendering premise, but the fact of me reading many other hard hitting books on the Holocaust, this just didn't touch me in the ticker, or punch me in the guts as much.A decent read, but with mixed results."}, {"userName": "Canadian Reader", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103966-canadian-reader", "userReview": "In 1941, when Helga Schneider was four and her brother Peter not even two years of age, they were abandoned by their mother. Their father, Stefan, was on the front, fighting for Hitler at the time, and an aunt and their paternal grandmother stepped in to care for the children. Soon after, Stefan remarried. Helga was not to see her mother, Traudi, for another thirty years. From Bologna (where she\u2019d moved in 1963 as a sixteen year old) Helga travelled with her young son to Vienna to see Traudi who, she learned, had abandoned her children because of her fervent commitment to the National Socialist Party. In fact, Traudi had been a fanatical servant of the Fuhrer. During this 1971 meeting, Traudi showed complete indifference to her grandchild. Her chief interest was in proudly displaying her SS uniform to her daughter. She offered Helga a handful of heavy gold jewellery, stolen from Jews (it might come in handy one day) and revealed that she had participated in the exterminations at Auschwitz-Birkenau. But Helga Schneider\u2019s book isn\u2019t about the 1971 meeting\u2014after which she determined she would expunge the woman from memory. It is actually an account of the final, two-hour meeting she and her cousin Eva had with Traudi in 1998, twenty-seven years later. Gisela, a Viennese friend of Traudi, had written to Helga in August, 1998 to report that Traudi\u2019s health was failing. She had been behaving in increasingly bizarre ways: purging recently purchased items from her apartment, cleaning obsessively\u2014floors flooded with pail upon pail of water, attempting to order coffins for her dead children, and regularly getting lost in the city. She was now in a home for the aged and likely had little time left. If Helga wanted to see her . . . well, perhaps this was the last chance. Helga made the journey. Her book details the intense, emotional confrontation she had with her mother, a true believer if there ever was one. Traudi had begun as an \u201cassistant\u201d to the doctors who performed muscle-regeneration and bone-grafting experiments on prisoners in Ravensbruck. She had then chosen to undergo \u201cdehumanization training\u201d in order to work at Birkenau.LET ME GO is an appalling and riveting document. Schneider judiciously incorporates some material from a text on Nazi medical experimentation and offers a play-by-play of the turbulent and complex emotions she experienced while in the presence of the frail ninety year old who was plainly cognitively compromised, yet possessed a razor-sharp recall of her time as one of Hitler\u2019s henchwomen\u2014one of his Furies.I know of no other written text that details the kind of encounter Helga Schneider had with Traudi. However, the book put me in mind of the equally powerful 2006 documentary INHERITANCE , whose subject is Monika Hertwig, daughter of the infamous \u201cButcher of Plaszow\u201d, Amon Goeth (famously \u201cchanneled\u201d by Ralph Fiennes for Steven Spielberg\u2019s movie SCHINDLER\u2019S LIST). Schneider\u2019s book is short and can easily be read in a single sitting. I wish that the author had documented how she initially managed to find her mother at all and that she had also provided more information about her childhood, adolescence, and her life after the 1998 meeting. One can only come by these details by reading the press around the book and the relatively recent film, starring Juliet Stevenson, based on Schneider\u2019s harrowing final encounter with the woman who had abandoned her fifty-seven years before."}, {"userName": "trovateOrtensia ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9616721-trovateortensia", "userReview": "\"Dopo ventisette anni oggi ti rivedo, madre, e mi domando se nel frattempo tu abbia capito quanto male hai fatto ai tuoi figli.

It sickens me just to think I'm a member of the same species as Helga Schneider's mother. We're not really the same species, though. I am homo sapiens and she was homo monsterus horribilis. It's bad enough that a woman would abandon her two small children without hesitation or sorrow. Worse that she would do it to serve pure evil. Helga's mother left them so she could join the SS and be a guard at Birkenau. There she selected people to be murdered, and participated in unspeakable acts of torture. She later worked at Ravensbruck, helping the \"doctors\" with their brutal experiments on Jewish prisoners.

It is, basically, the portrait that a daughter makes of her own mother, an unrepentant and ferocious jewish-hater Nazi who, decades after the fall of the regime, still hangs on to her despicable beliefs. The frankness and discomfort of the author are heartbreaking. She tries to reach out to her mother when the latest is gravely ill, despite the fact that she despises her, and also tries to come to terms with her own guilt. She partly fails, of course, because it is impossible to come to terms with pure evil - although one can imagine that writing this book has been a necessary cathartic experience for her. It is a courageous book: writing about your own parent like this is not easy. It also illuminates one of the most troubling aspect of the Nazi era - which is actually universal: how evil lies in the most ordinary people, and how anyone, really, can become a monster. It is chilling and horrifying - some gruesome revelations are even shocking. Schneider's writing is simple and direct, as it should be with such a subject. It's the kind of book that haunts you for a long time."}, {"userName": "Sara Cristina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59413385-sara-cristina", "userReview": "Gosto de livros relacionados com esta tem\u00e1tica (Holocausto), achei a premissa interessante, o testemunho de uma menina, filha de uma SS.

I felt conflicted most of the time when reading this account. The style of writing is nothing special, but the content is quite haunting, though not in a good way. This is the account of an obviously confused and troubled daughter who has been abandoned by her mother when a small child so that the mother could serve Hitler in the SS. Helga (the daughter, and writer), though in her 50s now, has understandably been tormented by imaginings of what her mother did and saw as a guard at Birkenau, and also by her own resentments about the personal impacts of the loss of her mother on her adolescence.This is the record of her apparently final visit to her mother in a nursing home, and the conversations that took place in that two and a half hours or so.Its hard to know if I'm being unreasonable in considering Helga to possibly be mentally ill - I suppose it would be difficult for her to be otherwise. It's one of those situations in which we all are at our worst - seeing our mothers whom we have never forgiven and trying to pick the scabs of our old wounds and fears, whilst being revolted at what we are bringing to the light of day. I'm sure Helga is quite capable of behaving normally in everyday life - and frankly I too regress back into childhood much to my regret when my mother visits, so this resonates quite well with me (I have to say my mum is a pussycat compared to this lady!). It feels uncomfortable to visit Helga's mother with her, and to see not just the cold calculation of the SS guard that she was, but also the almost perverted curiosity of Helga about issues such as whether the Jews from the gas chambers were ever cremated whilst still alive, especially when they cut back on the quantity of crystals used to kill them, or her more understandable questions of how her mother managed to reconcile her conscience with the gassing of tiny children. I feel like a peeping tom, dragged into uncomfortably close examination of the shocking dirty unresolved washing of this relationship. It is an interesting examination, at the end of the day, of the damage done to Helga, and although there are some interesting insights into the rationalisations of those serving the Fuhrer, there are few surprises in her mother. Helga sends us back through flashbacks into episodes from her childhood which have some bearing on the stories her mother tells, some of which are guilty secrets of the influence of the regime on German children to hate Jewish people. But overall, this is a bit like a flirtation with insanity and the obscene, and I'm not altogether glad that I have read it, as much for the unflattering truths that are revealed about Helga, as for those of her mother."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291846-david", "userReview": "This is a gripping and heart-wrenching memoir, that \"spoke\" to me on several levels. The author was born in Poland in 1937, and grew up in Berlin. When she was only 4, her mother abandoned the family to join the Nazi SS cause. She worked in the concentration camps, assisting in the work of genocide. Her daughter learns the terrible truth years later and spends decades of her life with no contact with the mother, until learning that she is becoming senile and weakening in a nursing home. She reluctantly goes to visit for a final conversation; most of this book documents the revelations of that day.It's a complicated investigation of emotions, motivations, relationships, conscience, confession, and self-understanding. How does a person accept a mother who participated willingly and gladly in the most horrific acts possible? How does a mother repair the wounds of abandoning her own daughter? How do you see through senility to find the true heart of a person? How does anyone understand the cruelty and bigotry that were at the heart of the Nazi atrocities?In some ways, listening to this book was a draining experience; but it was also fascinating and thought-provoking.

My heart goes out to the author. This book was hard to get through at times, I can't imagine living it. The author's mother is completely unrepentant about her actions during WW II and a complete believer devoted to Hitler's ideologies. The author struggles to deal with both the abandonment of her mother in an especially challenging time period as well as coming terms to the terrible things her mother did in the concentration camps without any sign of remorse. I consider myself fairly well versed when it comes to WW II, but I was surprised to learn about the dehumanization training that SS guards had to go through to more or less make them immune to their victims' sufferings. As far as Holocaust stories go, the descriptions are not especially graphic, but oddly disturbing in their stark medical language.

Sadly, I found nothing. The characters didn't change. It was a tale of awfulness that held no hope. Perhaps this is reality. Perhaps I am too idealistic, but it was like watching a car wreck.

Interspersed with a telling of the events of the visit are the author's memories of her childhood and of her previous visit to her mother in 1971. I recognized many German attitudes and behaviors from my own experiences with growing up with a German mother who lived through World War II, and the book has even more meaning for me because of that connection. The twisted psychology of the mother is also very interesting. She is cruel and unrepentant, but occasionally evidence of her inner torture is exposed. There is also some cruelty in the daughter's approach to dragging stories out of her mother, knowing it will be their last visit, making for an interesting comparison. I listened to the audiobook, but this is one I may have to buy and add to my bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Eva Leger", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336770-eva-leger", "userReview": "This is a great book- it's the story of a little girl who was abandoned at a very young age along with her small brother and father by her mother. Her mother decided she'd join the SS and went to work in the camps. I can't say it's the best book on the subject as a whole but it's a different perspective than I've read before and it accounts her mother still at a very odl age, not showing a bit of remorse for her actions. In fact, her mother shows the exact opposite even very near death. This goes into the authors struggle between trying to be there for her sick and dying mother and being disgusted with her as a person.

Helga, abbandonata alla tenera et\u00e0 di 5 anni, rivede brevemente la madre negli anni '70 per poi ritrovarla, alla fine degli anni '90, in una triste casa di cura, vecchia e sola ma a pi\u00f9 tratti ancora lucida e diposta a svelare alla figlia pezzi del suo passato e a soddisfare curiosit\u00e0 che non saranno altro che ferite. La stesura di \"Lasciami andare madre\" \u00e8 indubbiamente costata molto a Helga Scheider, lacerata tra la rabbia e la vergogna per i crimini di cui la madre si \u00e8 resa complice e l'incapacit\u00e0 di rinnegrala completamene a causa di un vincolo di sangue che, nonostante la fredezza e la sofferenza, continua a sentire: il suo bisogno di sapere la conduce in un terreno dove non avrebbe mai voluto spingersi e dove al contempo, inconsciamente, aveva sempre voluto arrivare, forse per avere finalmente delle ripsoste, delle conferme a quelle che erano le sue convinzioni...perch\u00e8 la madre aveva deciso di intraprendere un'attivit\u00e0 simile? Non aveva mai provato pena per le prigioniere? Non aveva mai provato, in seguito, senso di colpa per ci\u00f2 che aveva fatto? Le risposte che Helga otterr\u00e0 sono prevedibili anche quasi per lo stesso lettore. Forse il dialogo di \"Lasciami andare madre\" \u00e8 fin troppo personale e al contempo complesso per essere scritto, letto e apprezzato, e quello che ne ho ricavato \u00e8 una sensazione di tristezza, incompiutezza e prevedibilit\u00e0 che non mi ha toccata particolarmente. Tuttavia ho apprezzato lo stile lucido e intimista dell'autrice e il suo coraggio di scavare cos\u00ec a fondo nel suo inconscio e nel passato di una madre che, nonostante tutto, ora che \u00e8 abbandonata a se stessa, la implora di non lasciarla."}, {"userName": "May ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17052033-may", "userReview": "\u00a1Qu\u00e9 duro leer este libro!

Cos\u00ec si diventerebbe una persona nuova, vergine, e si sarebbe pronti ad affrontare un altro carico di orrore come quello donatoci da Helga Schneider. Carico di orrore che non \u00e8 solo dato dalla \"trama\" (se di trama si pu\u00f2 parlare in un romanzo autobiografico) ma sopratutto da come questa viene affrontata, in un modo che definire morboso \u00e8 - sinceramente - fargli un complimento. Di nuovo, non \u00e8 l'argomento a essere messo in discussione. Di libri sull'Olocausto ne sono stati fatti centinaia, migliaia, e ancora ne verranno fatti, e ognuno di questi ha una sua maniera di approcciarsi al tema. Oltre alla distinzione tra libri storici, per specialisti, e tra romanzi, c'\u00e8 chi \u00e8 delicato e soffuso come chi non risparmia al lettore le atrocit\u00e0. Lasciami andare madre appartiene alla seconda categoria. E di per s\u00e9 non sarebbe un male: come purtroppo stiamo imparando in questi giorni drammatici, mostrare senza filtri l'orrore pu\u00f2 avere uno scopo educativo, di testimonianza. In una parola, di sensibilizzazione. Ti mostro l'orrore proprio perch\u00e9 ti resti dentro e capisca che non devi mai fare lo stesso. Un metodo che si pu\u00f2 convidere come no - io ad esempio non lo condivido - ma si pu\u00f2 quantomeno comprendere.Il problema \u00e8 che Lasciami andare madre non ha nessuno scopo di testimonianza, e quindi questa morbosit\u00e0 non ha alcun senso di esistere. Lo si nota dall'andamento stesso della conversazione tra la madre gerarca nazista con probabile demenza senile e la figlia abbandonata, in cui \u00e8 quest'ultima, con intento masochistico, a dirottarla verso i temi pi\u00f9 terribili, anche attraverso ricatti emotivi in piena regola. E gi\u00e0 potremmo discutere sul senso di invitare il lettore in questa conversazione privata, che riguarda comunque una donna - seppure dalla morale discutibile - non pi\u00f9 sana di mente. Lei non si \u00e8 potuta opporre al fatto che le sue parole venissero messe in stampa, il lettore non si pu\u00f2 opporre ad assistere, seppure disgustato. Leggendo non ci si pu\u00f2 ingannare: Helga Schneider non ha scritto questo libro per farne un documento, per testimoniare l'orrore nazista da un punto di vista alternativo, ma per un non meglio precisato tentativo di curare queste ferite insanabili, come dimostrano anche le lunghe sezioni dedicate alla matrigna che non l'aveva mai amata, e che in un vero documento storico sarebbero state semplicemente fuori posto. Purtroppo, credo che questo libro sia utile solo all'autrice. Potr\u00f2 sembrare dura e senza piet\u00e0, ma Lasciami andare madre appare davvero come un lavoro di masochismo, che nel suo delirio raggiunge anche il lettore. Se volete documentarvi su Birkenau, e sui campi di concentramento in generale, leggete libri specialistici, guardate documentari, visitateli.

How do you reconcile that she abandoned you and your baby brother because her love for the Nazi regime was greater than her love for you? How do you live with the knowledge she has no remorse or regret for her acts and indeed, proclaims pride and glee over her actions in Ravensbr\u00fcck and Auschwitz? Helga Schneider has not seen her mother Traudi in 20 years. When she is contacted by her mother's friend letting her know Traudi is sick with possible dementia, Helga realises this may be her last chance to get some kind of answers from her mother about her actions during WW2. Accompanied by her cousin they visit the nursing home where Traudi is being cared for by an incredibly patient and kind staff. However, Traudi is militantly unrepentant and indeed revels in her past actions. Despite repeated questioning and a pathological need to have her mother express some regret for leaving her children to fend for themselves (aged 5 and 2) in wartime Berlin, Helga is repeatedly rebuffed and rejected. Traudi has no understanding of or interest in her children\u2019s abandonment and pain \u2013 her love of the F\u00fchrer being all-encompassing!This really isn\u2019t a book about Helga Schneider achieving some kind of closure (gods I hate that word) or even an understanding of her mother and her own life. There is no meeting of the minds here or a tear-jerking conclusion. This is a description of what it was like for those who had to survive the collapse of the Nazi regime; left behind with the legacy of their parents while somehow atoning for the actions of others. (In Germany in 1946 all of a sudden there were no Nazisand an entire generation of children grew up with no knowledge of what their parents had done or allowed to be done until the horrible truth started coming out in the 1960s.)

So yeah, I feel that leaving yet another time with nothing answered is a loss. I feel she wasted so many years feeling this anger or mixed emotions or whatever you want to call it due to her mother abandoning them that she missed that chance when she might have gotten some answers because she let so many years go by that by the time she was to confront the situation again, the mother was already senile. Maybe the mother saw her inward struggle with everything that she didn't think she was strong enough to hear the \"truth\" as she so claimed she wanted to know. Maybe that's why she never got those answers and if she was that conflicted and not strong enough to fight for those answers at an earlier time then maybe she just wasn't strong enough to handle the truth. The only bad thing is that we get no answers either. From all the Holocaust stories, this story was quite different and I feel I might have enjoyed it a lot more if those questions had actually gotten answered. I wish I had gotten a lot more insight to the mother regarding her character before she left. I wonder if that man mentioned was an influence, maybe some love interest (?), and the motive for her abandoning everything she knew and her babies and if he was the reason she pursued being a member of the SS. Maybe I missed something. I'm pretty sure she was in a hard situation being that she just couldn't understand how someone she loved and begged not to leave (her mother), someone who is our everything as children, could do such heinous things to people and feel proud about it and still have no remorse.

It's an obsessed daughter who is trying to vilify her mother to make it \"ok\" that she left.

No, I don't regret it.' But a very large part of me wonders if that mentality hasn't done anything but allow her to live without feeling crippling guilt.No, that's not ok.No, that's not an excuse.No, she should have to live with those feelings that she directly contributed to peoples -children's- deaths willingly. But she's also a very old lady, who, according to her caretaker, doesn't always know what's going on. We are told she is most lucid when talking about her time serving in the Party. Which, was an overwhelmingly huge part of her life. She chose to abandon her children, (maybe she was someone who married and had kids because that's what you did in those days, as a woman, you had no choice.) She chose to volunteer for the Nazi party. (Watching your Aryan neighbors disappear for being possible sympathizers could have been pretty nerve wracking) Possibly, her \"moments of lucidity\" aren't really true? Maybe they are stories she has heard, and immersed herself in to make herself more \"important.\" Either way, true or not, I cannot get over how these confessions are so very obviously something the daughter pushed for- she continuously verbally assaults, prods, blackmails her mother into telling her more and more and more.

What I will say though is that the writing wasn't equally strong. I wanted to find out more about the mother - daughter relationship, how her mother's choices affected Helga and the way she brought up her own son. I wanted to know more about Helga herself and how she dealt, over the years, with the tragic past of her family and I didn't feel I got to know her well (maybe for a reason and it was Helga's choice to keep it that way).Nonetheless, it's a story worth reading and I'd definitely recommend it.

I don't understand how the nursing home where she lived was so accepting of her, almost cherishing her.

Why did the author's mother turn to Nazism and desire to become an Auschwitz guard? Who may have influenced her to take this path in life? She alludes to a man but never develops that.
