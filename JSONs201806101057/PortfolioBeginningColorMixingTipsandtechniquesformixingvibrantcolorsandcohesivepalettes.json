It starts the introduction from how to set your studio / organise your materials and covers what you will need then goes into well explained colouring methods and information on colours. There is lots of terminology and methods to learn. I would recommend this book to people who want a kick start to oil / acrylic painting.Also, It would have been nice to see some watercolour advice."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40952895-samantha", "userReview": "This helpful Beginning Colour Mixing book is a wonderful addition to any artist starting out.

I splash colour about on a canvas, sometimes I get lucky and it looks good, but most times it is an awful mess and I need to paint over it. This book is really easy to read and understand, all the sections from \"getting started\",\" colour theory\", \"painting with colour\" to \"painting from life\" have been well explained, illustrated and examples of are shown. I particularly love the \"painting with colour\" section as it is extremely informative and illustrates what different colour placement make.

The artist, Kimberly Adams, certainly has full right to be teaching others about color theory and mixing colors, based on the artwork shown in this book. Half the time I found myself distracted by her beautiful work, only to remember I was supposed to be reading the book\u2026\tThis guide is wonderfully comprehensive, from cover the basics (like setting up a workspace and how to understand a color wheel), to color placement and individual tips on the use of many different colors. I want to say there are about three to four pages for the most common colors used, and the artwork that goes along with each guide is both beautiful and supportive. \tAlso included are some tips and tricks for painting from life, with some really fantastic step by step images showing the progression of a few different pieces of her work. I particularly loved these images \u2013 seeing how Kimberly Adams layered the paintings was both fascinating and informative. \tI really enjoyed reading this guide by Kimberly Adams, and I would love to see more of her work.

The author creates colorful, finger-painted, Impressionistic landscapes. Her technique is to use vivid colors straight from the tube (mainly oil, but also acrylic or watercolor) and place dabs of color next to each other to create eye-catching paintings. (This book won't be of much help if you're looking for instruction on mixing your own colors on a palette; it's about placing color on the canvas.)The author briefly covered tools, materials, etc., and then discussed the basics of colors and color theory. Then she talked about the main colors--reds, pinks, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, purples, neutrals, black and white--as well as the specific paint colors that she uses to create a range of red (or other) colors in her paintings. She also gave tips about specific paint colors that look good together and how to use color to draw the eye or unify the painting.She was very easy to understand and her demonstrations were clear and well-illustrated. She provided 4 step-by-step landscape demonstrations (lighthouse and ocean, clouds and a field, fall trees, and more trees) in her Impressionistic style. Overall, I'd recommend this book to any painter who is drawn to her vivid, colorful paintings--like the one on the cover.I received a free ebook review copy from the publisher through NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7306509-janet", "userReview": "I received a DIGITAL Advance Reader Copy of this book from #NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
