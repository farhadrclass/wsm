Truth is I know it won't as there are more sitting on my bookshelf right now waiting for me to choose one. I really enjoyed the story, liked the characters and at times wanted to beat their heads, or mine, into a wall. Set in New England three sisters live their adult lives in the shadows of the past. Being the children of a famous artist just adds flavor. Three separate women living three separate lives all in the shadow of each other. While living under a cloud of the past that they, and their mother, cannot seem to spread beyond.At times I literally wanted to bash heads. Someones. Anyones. I got so frustrated with everyone alluding to and talking around these horrible things that had happened to shape who each sister had become. Rarely did they actually talk about it. Work through it. They talked around it. And that made me want to bash heads. But it also made me actually think. Not something you expect from what you picked up and anticipated to be a beach read. How often does each and every last one of us tiptoe around our own stories. How often do we talk around, walk around, think around those big things that helped to create who we are, flaws and all? Instead of dealing with it, moving past it, and filing it into the bin of done and over with thanks for the experiences and the knowledge. I am just as guilty as the next person of letting the big stuff continue to dominate my choices and decisions instead of learning from it and then moving forward. We are all guilty at some point of letting our pasts dictate our futures. Rice did an excellent job of telling the story so the reader knew what was going on while also playing out these all to human circumstance. I think of all the girls, Skye and their mother gained the most throughout this novel. They gained self-respect, they gained a sense of self and in the mother's case she gained a sense that she was enough for her daughters in the best way she could be at any given moment. Not necessarily what they wanted or even needed but she was enough.I'm glad I own this book because it is one I would read again. I also think that it is one that in re-reading you will pick out more things that were missed the last time around. I have to apologize for thinking that 'Firefly Beach' was just a beach read, and not because of the title. It's a book that makes you want to bash heads but also makes you think. If you really think you can find the parallels, in thought process if nothing else, to yourself and others you know. Hopefully through the characters' growth you might just find a little bit of growth for yourself as well.Originally published at https://fizzypopcollection.blogspot.c...."}, {"userName": "Goddess Of Blah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4234324-goddess-of-blah", "userReview": "this book is not perfect, however, the mature, intense, powerful, story superseded all the criticism i could bestow.

I became interested in this series when I read Beach Girls by this author earlier in the year. This book is about the complicated relationships of parents, children, brothers and sisters and lovers. It is also about the simple and undying love of a dog for its owners. Caroline, Clea and Sky are the daughters of Augusta and Hugh Renwick. He is a complicated, talented artist - a man who was unable to be faithful, made decisions that had serious ongoing results for his family, especially his girls.Caroline is the one that always seems to be there for the others, in a crisis she can be relied on. Clea is the only one happily married, Skye is married but the only thing her husband seems to be able to do is lead her every more deeply into depression and alcoholism.Joe Connor is a scientist and treasure hunter. He once had a relationship with Caroline through letters but as a teenager he learned how she had always known about the circumstances of how is father died and never told him. Feeling betrayed, he cut off all ties with her. Yet how could she have shared what she knew? Sam is Joe's half brother, like Joe a scientist and Sam has always looked up to Joe, but never really experienced that deep brotherly bond with Joe that he craves.One summer they all meet, and it is time to face the past, admit what they really want and take the risk, turn their back on fear and reach for love.This story explores the relationship of guns in people's lives, how alcoholism covers up the pain that can't be faced. It also explores the bonds in family, that while people may be flawed ultimately love can triumph.I didn't fall deeply in love with this story as I did with Beach Girls, but it was still a thought provoking read and I fully felt for these characters and the circumstances they were caught up in."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2176661-sharon", "userReview": "This was a very interesting character driven book. When Caroline was 5, she was present when her father's lover's husband came to Firefly Hill and threatened her mother and her family. He was despondent and out for revenge. He did not harm the family, in fact he did irreversible harm to himself as he committed suicide in front of the 2 children and their pregnant mom. You would think this would be enough to throw the husband bum out, wouldn't you? Not to be, Caroline's mother was obsessively in love with her husband, to the exclusion of everything, his infidelity, his alcoholism, and their children. Caroline grew up as the cornerstone of her family, the one always to be depended upon and turned to in times of trouble and indecision. Indeed they need her, her mom is almost unconscious, her oyoungest sister Skye a tortured alcoholic, her other sister has a successful marriage. They all depend on Caroline to make their decisions.When Joe Connor was 5, his father died at Firefly Hill. He had never met Caroline but they struck up a correspondence that was to last through their adolescence until Joe found out the truth about what happened to his father and cut Caroline off from all communication with no explanation. Joe is back, in fact he's in Caroline's small town and the bond they formed is stronger than ever. They have work to do if they are to fix the mistakes of the past."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10201598-connie", "userReview": "This was one of the most boring books I have ever read.

I have to say, the first half of this book almost, almost fit into the second category. But there was that mysterious element, small but there, that whispered book redemption. Which in the second half came through, making it a worthwhile read. Love and caring in flawed characters is a necessary ingredient (for me) to \"relate\" to a book (and this book had that). The going beyond limitations in a shortish page frame is also important (and in this book that is where it almost lost me--it took a long, long, LONG while for all the characters to step past their greatly focused-upon limitations; that feeling of \"get over it already.\") That said: The slim but winning quality of this book was that it was done in such a way that as it moved along, I found myself accepting that maybe, just maybe, all these flawed characters are simply a part of life and loving and you have to take in the bad with the good. That's an obvious statement, of course, but it's not a theme that is always successfully carried in a book. Too many flaws, too much coming up against the same thing over and over again and I grow restless and bored and the book goes into the \"this sucks\" category. We all see enough of pain and limitation, I don't need to live another variety of it through these characters.One element that is part-solution to the mystery is that the reading of each good (vs. bad) book always has its own emotional d\u00e9nouement--the moment I get the swish of loving what I have read and that all the trials of reading (which there always are in books on painful subjects) have served a purpose. The feeling of climbing to a mountaintop, with all it's effort and strain, to reach the breathtaking view. I did get that with this book, but it was rather short-lived and then it downgraded to the predictable.Other books (the ones not on painful subjects) are simply enjoyable throughout. The normal human limitations and character flaws are overcome, as they must be for a story to grow, but they are not as deep and penetrating, as \"in your face\" as the purpose of the story. In non-comedies, hope, growth, strength are the purpose vs. painstakingly overcoming something tragic/flawed/seriously limiting.Author Charles Martin is still the best I've found who has the ability to totally take me in and carry me on a painful subject--he actually makes it exquisitely tender throughout. I think of his two Maggie books (plus others). And Martin is also an example of authoring a book enjoyable throughout--I think of his \"The Mountain Between Us.\" (Not beloved by all, but definitely by me.)Authors Anne Tyler and Anita Shreve are examples of writing \"this sucks\" books. Hopelessness has something to do with it, for sure, along with a deadness of characters, a remove of emotion, a simple lack of something essential that I've yet to identify. In the few books that I've experienced of both, I don't walk away feeling better for having read them. And during the reading I feel pretty wooden.Mackenzie Ford's \"The Clouds Beneath the Sun\" and Yan Martel's \"Beatrice and Virgil\" totally go under the \"beyond sucks.\" Alison Pace's \"City Dog\" was also patently terrible.So the mystery remains. I'm still not sure of the elements (surely there are many), but this book does a credible job on exploring family dynamics and slips in under the header of enjoyable moments if not always enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/382146-kathy", "userReview": "A story of family, a family that struggles with the past, present and future\u2026 but a family that loves\u2026Hugh and Augusta\u2026.
