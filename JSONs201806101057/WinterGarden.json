WOW. WOW!!!! Winter Garden\u00a0was\u00a0one of the most \n  breathtaking\n\u00a0books that I have ever\u00a0read in my entire life. And I do not say that lightly. I cried so hard I couldn't even see the pages. The emotions were overpowering and all-consuming. It also\u00a0has THE. MOST. BEAUTIFUL. EPILOGUE. of all-time. The only other books that has\u00a0made me cry this hard before has been The Bronze Horseman\u00a0which is my favorite book in the world... My God, THE FEELS!!!! What began as a family mystery turned into an EPIC story of love and survival.I rarely give this rating, but this was 6 STARS!\n\n\"Vera,\" he says, making her look at him.\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\"You stay alive... Promise me. The three of you will make it to the end.\"\n\nOk, before anything, please note the genre of this book is Women's Fiction, and not specifically Romance even though there is indeed a beautiful, powerful, and heart-wrenching love story at the heart of the book. If you're a romance reader (like me), please don't worry though, I promise the ending is amazing.The other important things to know before you read is that I do think some readers might find the book a little slow at first and maybe even find that they didn't 'like' the characters. Don't let that worry you. I promise you there's a reason for this. This is a story that builds\u00a0in rich layers of complexity and emotional depth in such a way that it is absolutely worth it to stick with the story because the impact and delivery of both the second half of the book and especially the ending is just SO incredible and powerful!! As I was reading, my rating went from maybe 4 stars at first, to 4.5, to 5, then it was a solid 5++ stars for a while... then on page 380, my rating shot straight up to 6 stars. I read that page\u00a0and instantly got CHILLS through my entire body. SHIVERS. I re-read the page twice, then put the book down and just SOBBED my heart out. Pure ugly crying. Tears streaming uncontrollably down my face. The story\u00a0was so beautiful!!!!!!!\u00a0Because this book's genre is indeed different than my usual romance recommendations, I strongly suggest that you read the blurb before purchasing. It's a very\u00a0accurate representation of the story. For me personally, I knew I wanted to read this book the moment I read the blurb. If you're also intrigued by it, then you should definitely read this\u00a0book for SURE and as soon as possible. But if the blurb doesn't appeal to you, then I'll be really honest and say that \u00a0this book is likely not for you. But definitely check it out!!! It's worth every penny and for me, this book is a Forever Top Favorite.\u00a0Here's the blurb:\nMeredith and Nina Whitson are as different as sisters can be. One stayed at home to raise her children and manage the family apple orchard; the other followed a dream and traveled the world to become a famous photojournalist. But when their beloved father falls ill, Meredith and Nina find themselves together again, standing alongside their cold, disapproving mother, Anya, who even now, offers no comfort to her daughters. As children, the only connection between them was the Russian fairy tale Anya sometimes told the girls at night. On his deathbed, their father extracts a promise from the women in his life: the fairy tale will be told one last time\u2014and all the way to the end. Thus begins an unexpected journey into the truth of Anya's life in war-torn Leningrad, more than five decades ago. Alternating between the past and present, Meredith and Nina will finally hear the singular, harrowing story of their mother's life, and what they learn is a secret so terrible and terrifying that it will shake the very foundation of their family and change who they believe they are.\nKristin Hannah's writing is absolutely exquisite. She writes with a deeply profound and insightful understanding and portrayal of people that never ceases to amaze me. Her storytelling skills are almost unparalleled. I've read three of her books at this point and have been blown away by each one.I found it absolutely fascinating and captivating watching the way the 'fairy tale' that the mother was telling slowly blended into reality. The transition was so powerful -- there are all these subtle details that if you read carefully, you'll catch and they'll take your breath away. It's a truly stunning piece of writing.When I first started the book, I was reading more out of curiosity than anything else.\u00a0Truthfully, I found many of the characters to be cold and distant and wasn't really sure that I'd ever connect with them on an emotional level but I was intrigued enough by the story to keep reading. And along the way, there's this\u00a0undercurrent to the story that pulls you in deeper and just keeps growing stronger. I think that it's ok not to like the characters at first because one of the important messages of this book is how often and easily people misjudge each other without knowing their full story. I think it was written like that on purpose -- to make you\u00a0experience the message of the story first hand. Because I promise you by the end of this story, I was\u00a0overflowing with emotion. Few books have ever made me\u00a0care so deeply for the characters as this one did. This isn't just a story you read, it's an experience you go through.This isn't just one of my favorite books of the year, it's\u00a0one of my favorite books of all-time. I know for a certainty that no matter how many books I read, this will always remain precious to me. It has\u00a0beautiful writing, a breathtaking story, and a powerful ending --\u00a0the true sign of a fantastic novel.\n\n\"I think maybe love can just... dissolve.\"\n\n\n\"No, it does not,\" her mother said.\n\n\n\"So how do --\"\n\n\n\"You hang on,\" her mother said. \"Until your hands are bleeding, and you still do not let go.\"\n\nRating: 6 STARS! Standalone._______________________________________ For more of my reviews, book news and updates:\u2726 Main blog: Aestas Book Blog\u2726 Facebook Blog Page\u2726 Twitter \u2726 Subscribe by email"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9684061-melissa", "userReview": "Once again, I find myself in awe of the power and beauty of Kristin Hannah\u2019s words. She gives her readers the ability to crawl inside the story and see the world through the eyes of her characters. It\u2019s her stunning gift for capturing the heart wrenching and emotional aspect of every connection that left me completely enamored with this family. Every single one of them. By the time I reached the end of the story, I was nowhere near ready to let them go. There are people everywhere that find themselves in tumultuous relationships, but I think it would be the cold and uncaring attitude of a parent that would have the power to slice anyone to the core. Welcome to Meredith and Nina\u2019s world. They grew up vying for their mother Anya\u2019s love and attention, only to be pushed away and ignored. The worst part was seeing that she was actually capable of love in some ways. Anya shared an enviable connection with her husband; he adored her despite her frigid nature towards their daughters, but why? What did their dad see that Meredith and Nina couldn't?Interlaced with a Russian fairytale that changes absolutely everything, this story is harrowing and heartbreaking, in so many ways. It\u2019s the buried resentments that get unearthed, the hidden regrets that are revealed and the realization that there is more to everyone\u2019s story that provides the much needed answers. Reality is, life is a series of choices - some are remarkable and some naturally morph in to regrets - good or bad, the culmination make us who we are.My favorite part of the entire story was the dynamic between the two sisters. Meredith was always the steadfast and responsible one and Nina was the wild and free sister, but they were both strong, just in different ways. Both admired one another for exactly what they regretted the most in themselves and I found that quite interesting. I guess, the grass always seems greener on the other side, right? And of course, the love story junkie in me would be remiss not to mention Danny and Jeff. I was completely smitten with both, they were as different as the sisters, but worthy in their own ways.Of course, the ending left me in tears. If you didn't know, I'm a complete and utter cry baby. It felt like my heart was literally torn in two - between what could have been and what was - but ultimately it was still a happy place to be.\n\nFavorite Quote:\n\n \u201cTo lose love is a terrible thing. But to turn away from it is unbearable. Will you spend the rest of your life replaying it in your head? Wondering if you walked away too soon or too easily? Or if you'll ever love anyone that deeply again?\""}, {"userName": "Crumb", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53025065-crumb", "userReview": "One of the best books I've ever read. Period. \u272d\u272d\u272d\u272d\u272dThe five star rating that this book deserves - no, demands - makes me question all of my other books that I had given a five star rating. A five star rating should really be elusive, hard to achieve. But sometimes, when you are in the grip of a good book, you get a little fast and loose with your ratings. Well, I'm guilty of it from time to time. I am officially admitting that, \"My Name is Crumb, and I'm a Five Star Rating Junkie.\" This book has made me realize that only the very best of books should be crowned with a five star rating, and this is one of them. Thus, moving forward, I am going to exercise much more discrimination when doling out my stars. Nina and Meredith never had a mother they could count on or could talk to about boys. The only thing their mother was good for was telling them Russian fairy tales from her youth; Little did they know how important those fairy tales really were. Their father, however, was their hero. What they couldn't get from their mother, they got in spades from their father. When their father dies from heart problems, they are heartbroken. Nina's father makes a final proclamation as he lays dying: He wants Nina to convince her mother to tell the full fairy tale of \"The Peasant Girl and The Prince.\" This fairy tale does more for their family than any of them could have ever expected. It will lead them on a journey of a lifetime..This book is about dysfunction between family members and finding hope when it seems as if all hope is lost. Nina is a world-class photographer and is never in one place for too long. She was never the type to want a family or to settle down. When her father dies however, she comes back to be with her mother and Meredith. Meredith, took over the family business. When she first arrives, Meredith's life is in shambles. She is going through a difficult time at home. There is a distance between herself and her spouse that was never there before and when Nina comes home, it makes everything worse, amplified. The interactions between the sisters was so incredibly fascinating. As a reader, I could see how much they loved each other, but I could also see how much they wanted to change each other. They couldn't accept one another for who they each were as individuals. Nothing either of them did was ever right. And when it came to caring for their mother, forget it. Everything they did was completely wrong. I found this novel to be both breathtaking and magnificent, yet exponentially heart-wrenching. It made me feel things I didn't even know I was capable of feeling. This book evoked such emotion in me, I didn't even realize I had tears streaming down my face. There are books that I read and I love.. and then there are those few, inimitable books that change me. That shake me to the core. This was one of them.Note: This was a traveling sisters read..

This is written in the past and present tense, which is a common scenario in many novels, but one that I enjoy. It's like reading two different novels.What starts as a dysfunctional domestic situation between 2 sisters (American born) and their Russian-born mother ends up being so much more. Grief and a deathbed promise brings these unhappy women reluctantly together, and what seemed like a familial dysfunction becomes an intimate look at war-torn Leningrad and the atrocity of war. One cannot fathom the pain, hunger, starvation and death all around the survivors, the terror of small children being taken by train away from their parents, starving, cold and afraid. Very moving, and well written. In the present-day story the description of Sitka, in Alaska and its history was very interesting. One can easily imagine it. The characters are flawed but believable, the novel hard to forget and the ending entirely satisfying to this reader. Definitely recommended.Gloria Bernal - Murrieta, CA."}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5499526-c", "userReview": "Just finished this stinker and I have a headache from rolling my eyes. It is disappointingly formulaic and borrows heavily from \"Sophie's Choice\", an infinitely superior novel. The writing is pedestrian. The characters are cardboard cut outs and insufferable to boot. I hate novels in which all the characters have to be beautiful. We are told over and over and over about the mother's \"astonishing eyes\" and the eldest daughter's \"curvy hips\", big eyes and \"Julia Robert's type mouth\". The younger daughter (a Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist, yet) has a heart shaped face, black pixie haircut and \"perfect skin\". The male characters are uniformly handsome and blond. For no discernible reason, the reader is constantly subjected to descriptions of what the characters are wearing, e.g., \"She exchanged her robe and pajamas for a pair of comfortable jeans and a cable-knit turtle neck sweater\". The character's musings are repeated and restated and reworded every few pages. This stuff goes on and on. I cannot stand writing like this. The story is ridiculous, the ending absurd (and stolen from about twenty tearjerker movies that I can think of). Someone I love recommended this book to me and I stuck it out for her, but I don't recommend it to you."}, {"userName": "Pouting Always", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-pouting-always", "userReview": "Meredith and Nina spent their whole lives without really knowing their mother Anya. Any attempts they tried to make to get close to her were rebuffed, so they gave up trying and began to believe that maybe their mother just didn't really care about them very much. When their father dies though he makes them promise to try to get to know their mother, and says that now that he will be gone their mother needs them. The story follows Meredith, Nina, and Anya as they get to know one another and grow closer and transition into different places in their individual lives. I really really enjoyed this book. This is the second book by Kristin Hannah that I read and I have been equally impressed by both. She really can tell a story because I was drawn in from start to finish. I even enjoyed the happy ending which I know I complained about but here it just felt like it flowed to that point naturally. I really want to read more from her."}, {"userName": "JanB ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb", "userReview": "Excellent heartfelt story about the troubled dynamics of the mother/daughter bond and the relationship between two sisters. Sisters Meredith and Nina couldn't be more different from one another, and have difficulty bridging the gap to find common ground. Their Russian-born mother, Anya, however, has always been cold and distant and the girls have felt unloved, affecting each of them in different ways. Their fragile bond is further threatened after the death of their father, who was the glue that held them all together. But the girls made a promise to their dying father and they gradually begin to draw the truth out of their mother through the fairy tale she's been telling for years, but never finished it to the end. Alternating chapters tell her story of growing up in Russia and her experiences in Leningrad during the war. And what a heartbreaking story it is as her sweet fairy tale turns into a horrifying tale of what was endured during the siege of Leningrad. More than a set of facts from a history book, Hannah makes you feel and I was brought to tears more than once.These three women slowly reconnect with one another during a trip to Alaska and the telling of their mother's story. There's a lot of universal truths contained within the pages of this book. So much of the personality quirks of each of the women is explained by delving into the dynamics of the family relationships. Lies and secrets can destroy relationships, but understanding a person's story gives clarity into their seemingly inconceivable ways of behaving in the present, bringing empathy and understanding. Can we ever know our parents (or anyone?) without knowing their story? I confess that I felt differently about some of the characters by the end of the novel than I did at the beginning. And Anya's story demonstrates that we can be sad for the lost years but it is never too late to right wrongs and mend broken relationships. The ending had me sobbing, even though it was tied up a little too predictably and neatly with a couple of unlikely coincidences. But I didn't care. I needed that ending.4.5 stars The narrator of the audio book was outstanding.This book was made even better by the excellent discussions with my fellow traveling Sisters:https://twogirlslostinacouleereading...."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24360539-thomas", "userReview": "5* This book starts off slow. It is a story of relationships--mother and two daughters, Meredith and Nina, and the two daughters who have a strained relationship. Their father, Evan has held the family together, making up for his wife not being able to show affection for her two daughters. But he has had a severe heart attack and is dying. In one last attempt to heal the emotional gulf between his wife and children, he asks his wife to tell them the fairy tale of the peasant girl and the prince. Then he asks Nina to listen and to do whatever is necessary to get Anya, their mom to tell them the whole story.Both Nina and Meredith have grown up into adults who are unable to have normal relationships with others. Meredith's marriage is failing, because she shuts her husband out with an emotional wall. Nina is a world famous photographer who runs away from family and commitment by flying off to the latest war/famine/disaster. She refuses to accept a marriage proposal from someone who loves her and she loves because of her stunted emotional growth.But Meredith and Nina and their mother come together through the fairy tale, which reveals long buried secrets of pain and sadness. I can't say more without going into spoiler territory. There is a connection to the siege of Leningrad. I recommend reading The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad by Harrison E. Salisbury. I visited St. Petersburg in 2012 and found a warning plaque, mentioned in the Salisbury book, that warned citizens to go to the opposite side of the street in case of shelling from the enemy. I liked the ending, which has a healing touch. I recommend this book to fans of historical fiction and fans of strong woman characters.One quote: \"Was that what they'd discover on this trip? That their mother was like one of her precious Russian nesting dolls, and if that were true, would they ever really see the one hidden deep inside?\"Thanks to St. Martin's Griffin for sending this book through the Goodreads giveaway program.My wife just finished this book and she agrees it is a 5 star read.

That is a theme also dear to Kristin Hannah, from what I read of her books and especially in Winter Garden:\n\"They would always be a family, but if she learned anything in the past few weeks it was that a family wasn't a static thing. There were always changes going on. Like with continents, sometimes the changes were invisible and underground, and sometimes they were explosive and deadly. The trick was to keep your balance. You couldn't control the direction of your family any more than you could stop the continental shelf from breaking apart. All you could do was hold on for the ride.\"\nWinter Garden tells the story of Meredith and Nina Whitson and their supposedly heartless mother Anya. For over an extended period we get to know of Anya while she faces tremendous obstacles and disaster, but ends surviving despite all her suffering. It's not a trivial novel; it's not romantic, it is almost an epic. It's repeatedly a struggle. I think it's written to be read on a sunny day, or it might be shattering. That is how I felt from the way it impacted me, as a mother and as a sister. Despite it all, I fully enjoyed it. Hannah tells a breathtaking story, I don't comment on it feebly. It is astonishing and heartbreaking.

We spent some time bundled up in blankets as two more of our TS joined in reading and discussing this one with us. Winter Garden is a well layered, intriguing and powerful family saga that explores the complicated relationships between a Mother and her daughters and the two sisters. The story is told from the past through a fairy tale told by distant, cold and interesting Anya who is layered with mystery and the present as we see how the fairy tale begins to bond these women together. Kristin Hannah cleverly and skillfully weaves an emotional fairy tale into the storyline that becomes the core of this story and we begin to see how it shaped the relationship between Anya and her daughters. We were drawn into the story through the fairy tale and it became a favorite part of the story for some of us. The imagery in the tale came to life for us and became very real. We felt many emotions as our hearts broke for the characters. Through the fairy tale, we come to know who the characters are. Brilliant! We all really loved the discussion we had for this one and we really dug deep into the emotional depth of this story and how it made us feel. We used some discussion questions that really enhanced our discussion. It\u2019s stories and discussions like this that really bring out the best reading experiences for me. The ending pushed this non-crier to choke up and fighting back the tears. I will leave you all with this quote from the story and we all highly recommend reading Kristin Hannah at her best with this one. \u201cJoy and sadness were part of the package, the trick, perhaps was to not let yourself feel all of it but to hold on to the joy just a little more tightly because you never knew when a strong heart could just give out.\u201d For my reviews featuring Kristin Hannah please check out our Travelling Sister Blog athttps://twosisterslostinacoulee.com"}, {"userName": "Jonetta", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta", "userReview": "Meredith Cooper and her sister, Nina Whitson, were raised by an adoring father and a pretty dispassionate and cold mother. The absence of that maternal love impacted the sisters differently, one striving for perfection, leading an orderly and pleasing life and the other living a nomadic existence. Both were considered highly successful but also seeming to seek something that was just beyond their grasp. When their father died, both women were left to developed a relationship with their mother, who was compelled by her husband's extraction of a deathbed promise to finally tell her story to her daughters.I think this is almost a tale of two stories as the first and second halves couldn't be more different. While I respected the sisters in the first half, I'm not sure I liked them that much. Their mother, Anya, was an enigma, confounding everyone with her seemingly lack of feeling for her children and I kept thinking her children should just move on. It moved rather slowly but all to lead up to an extraordinary second half where everything changed, including my opinions of all three characters. Anya's story was spellbinding as well as educational since we get rare insights into Stalin's Leningrad before and during the German invasion. It was at this point, I was reluctant to stop listening to this story.I've heard so much about the talented Susan Ericksen for her narration of the In Death series so I was prepared for a good performance. However, her narration far exceeded my expectations and her delivery of Anya's story was just incredible. I'm really, really happy I chose to listen to this book instead of reading.I very much enjoyed this story, including the slow build of the first half as it created the perfect foundation to launch the second. The ending, though bittersweet, had a surprise I never saw coming.

I finished this book about three weeks ago, and it\u2019s one that still pops into my mind (especially after yesterday\u2019s mid-March snow!). As noted in my review of The Great Alone, I read Winter Garden during the same time, making both books my first experience with Kristin Hannah. And I was so pleased. Winter Garden is the story of family dynamics and family dysfunction. It explores the lives of adult sisters Meredith and Nina, and their mother, Anya. Meredith and Nina, who are night and day from one another, do not have a warm, comfortable bond with their mother. The only thing that really connects all of them is the Russian fairytale Anya tells the girls when they are young. And when Meredith and Nina\u2019s dad becomes ill, he asks that the fairytale be told again.. in its entirety. For there is so much more to the story. Alternating between past and present, this story reminds us that we can\u2019t jump to assumptions. It reminds us that there is always way more happening than what\u2019s presented on the surface. It reminds us about the importance of communication and the difficulties of bearing those pieces of ourselves that we just don\u2019t want others to see. The story is beautifully written, and the journey is one of love, heartbreak, and pain. But in taking that ride, the sisters and their mother not only discover more about one another, they find themselves along the way too. Sidenote: as mentioned, I read two of Hannah\u2019s books during the same time. What really impressed me was that, even though both books dealt with family dysfunction/dynamics, they were both totally different from one another. Both books were very emotional, very heartbreaking, very painful. But the journeys were very different, and I walked away totally amazed. Hannah has proven she is a talented writer. It becomes challenging when you feel that you are reading the same types of stories over and over from one author. I did not feel this way at all with these two books. Hats off to Hannah for her amazing stories. I will definitely read more of her books. **This was another Traveling Sisters read. The discussions, once again, were excellent. Special thanks to Brenda for providing some fantastic, thought provoking questions for us to ponder.

But the one thing they do have in common is the love of their father, so when he falls sick and is dying they are both at his bedside. Neither Meredith or Nina ever shared the same love for their mother, but they promise their father that they will take care of her once he is gone. After their father passes away Meredith and Nina find the following few months rather difficult and soon realize that caring for their mother, Anya was going to be more than a challenge than either one of them imagined it to be. Anya had never expressed much love or affection for her girls over the years, in fact, she had been quite cold toward them, but she had her reasons and she knew it was time to explain to Meredith and Nina why she'd been so cold toward them all these years. But once all is revealed, will this bring Anya and her daughters closer or will it tear them apart forever? Winter Garden is a beautifully written tale about secrets, love, war, loss and so much more. Reading about Anya's time during the war was at times was troubling and heartbreaking. It makes you realize how lucky you are if you've never had to go through such horrendous times.

While this one was not as good as Nightingale, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed (and was moved) by it.Like Nightingale, Winter Garden includes a historical and modern day story (a two-fer, as my GR friend Cathrine calls it!). The historical tale is by far the better story here, and thankfully takes up the majority of the book. There are about a million reviews of this book, so I won't summarize the plot.

Unfortunately, I read The Night Road as my first book, and did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed works by other similar authors, namely, Picoult and Chamberlain.However, at the persuasion of more friends, I decided to give her another chance, so I chose Winter Garden as my fluff read at the end of last year to balance the stress. I was so wrong.The story was about two sisters, who were never loved by their Mom growing up, so each was sad and broken in her own way, yet managed to lead a quite normal and successful life as an adult. When their Dad died, they returned home, and insisted to find the answer for their Mom's sadness and alienation.I had tears streaming down my face when I tapped the last page on my Kindle, sitting at a Barnes and Noble cafe table, with people staring at me and murmuring to each other. I was wrong. This was definitely not a fluff read and indeed something with substance. It shows us the extreme of loss and grief; the pain that comes with loss when we love too much. We protect ourselves from the same pain happening to us again...by not loving.The story also taught me a bit of history of Leningrad during WWII, although, as a Chinese with extent knowledge of communism and the Cultural Revolution, nothing surprised me under the sun. However, the story still filled me with extreme sadness, regardless of the perfect ending. So, I was wrong again by judging an author with one book. My next read will be Firefly Lane...which most of my friends loved. There's nothing I love more than stories of women friendship!"}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1887310-irene", "userReview": "I may be unfairly harsh on this book because it is not my preferred reading. This is a recycled story. A woman endures overwhelming trauma as a young adult and emotionally shuts down in order to survive. But, the pain carried in secret, crushes her relationship with daughters. It is only when the adult daughter can learn the mother\u2019s story that empathy can grow and affection can flow between the generations. This is The Bone Setter\u2019s Daughter with the substitution of Russia for China. Only, this version of the story has the feel of a screen play targeting the women in Opra\u2019s audience. The present day sections of this story could be titled Women Are Snow Leopards; Men are Cocker Spaniels. The three women, mother and two adult daughters, all seem to suffer from emotional constipation. No matter how much they want to express affection, they just can\u2019t get it out. The only thing that does manage to pass on occasion are ice cubes. The three men on the other hand, the partners of each of these women, suffer from emotional diarrhea: their affection is hot, runny, and limitless even when not wanted. Maybe too many women want a partner who will make tender, passionate love at every encounter, who will tell them non-stop how much they are loved, even while being pushed away, who never gets angry or critical or impatient, but no human being is like this, unless a lobotomy has been performed. If you are going to re-tell a story, I would think it should offer something new to the reader, something that makes the effort to read and write it worthwhile. This is a fluffier version of Amy Tann\u2019s novel with a far less realistic present day setting. I suspect that this author envisioned this being turned into a movie; otherwise why all the repetitious tangerine skies and striking blue eyes against white hair. These irrelevant flowery descriptions must be set directions. This book needed to be at least 100 pages shorter."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Three and a half stars. Hard to write a review about this one as I had a few different thoughts. But here goes.Parts of this story about two sisters and their Russian immigrant mother were very interesting. Sometimes I had to put it aside for a while because I couldn\u2019t bear to read too much of the 1940s Leningrad stories at once. Some of the images, about a time I knew little about, were harrowing. It made me so thankful I have never lived through a world war and the tragedies that result. Other times I couldn\u2019t bear to the book aside at all and had to keep reading but that was once I got further into the novel. Initially I wasn\u2019t sure about it. The mother is a very cold and aloof person who seems to show no love to her daughters. I found her hard to relate to, until her story and past is revealed. Meredith and Nina also were hard to like. Meredith is a closed off sort of person, afraid to show emotion and Nina came across as selfish, with no regard for family. But circumstances contrive that the three women are left in a situation where they need to get to know each other. It is a story about the choices people make, the suffering they endure and how that impacts not only on their life but on others as well. I do admit to having the odd tear at times as the story progressed. I liked the idea of the fairy tale element that runs through the novel. The ending reflects that fairy tale feel. To me it seems just a little too contrived but maybe that\u2019s me."}, {"userName": "Ns", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3040548-ns", "userReview": "Winter Garden is a mesmerizing and enchanting novel about survival, enduring love, family, and the choices that can forever haunt you. With the death of the patriarch comes the further disintegration of an already fragile bond between a distant, secretive mother and her daughters who are as different as can be. With the loss of their father, Meredith and Nina Whitson find themselves no closer to their mother at a time when they should have found comfort in one another. Instead their mother retreat into her world of secrets and a haunting, unimaginable past.Having made a deathbed promise to her father to have her mother tell her fairy tale in its entirety and to the end, Nina is determined to fulfill that promise -this against a guarded sister and unwilling mother. What she does not realize is how meaningful and life-changing the story will be to her family.The fairy tale is anything but a simple tale, it is Meredith and Nina's only real connection to a mother they have never really gotten to know, having long-ago given up trying, much less understand. As the story is revealed, a dawning realization of who their mother really is, why she is the way she is, and an understanding of self come to light and thus, the three women begin a journey of self-identity. At the heart of the story is three women connected by the bonds of family who deal with grief differently and must come to terms with it. Who must learn to live on. For Anya Whitson, it means facing the ghosts of her past without the strength of her husband and learning to forgive and love. For Meredith and Nina it is understanding who their mother is without the shield of their father no longer protecting them from her indifference to them, and realizing who they are and what they want in life. The story alternate between the present and their mother's past, skillfully and meaningfully delving into historical facts and cultural traditions which bring relevance to the story. It is not just Anya's story which is compelling and heart-breaking, there is also Meredith and Nina's stories that reflect two women at crossroads in their lives. Meredith's marriage is slowly unravelling without love to support it or knowing how to get that love back. Nina's career no longer excites her, instead her exhaustion highlight her loneliness and longing to be loved but not daring to let herself be.Like the butterfly piece that is passed down from Anya's mother to herself and later her own daughter, it represent the gradual evolution of the three women who had begun a journey as strangers but at the end discovers who they really are and truly become a family."}, {"userName": "Alona", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10731908-alona", "userReview": "I picked this book for two reasons, one- I recently read The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah, and after it being one of the best books I read lately, I was eager for more!The other reason I picked this book out of her many best sellers was the WWII subject (yea, no surprise here, if you know me a little bit).So, what went wrong FOR ME was, that it wasn't like the blurb suggested- a story about two sisters learning their mother's story about what happened to her in Leningrad during the blockage, it was more of a story about a mother's mistakes and redemption, about the lives of two sisters, growing up with a mother who is disfunctional, and what it is doing to her family.The story about the Leningrad siege starts very late in the book (around 50%) and by that time I was already so tired, bored and annoyed that it failed to \"touch\" me like I \"need\" in the genre.The women in this book made me want to scream at how unemotional they where, and how they treated the good men around them.Maybe if I knew in advance what I'm about to read, it wouldn't have felt like the first 50% was just a loooong introduction that I wanted to skip!

This had all the things I could hate about a book - writing like, - she worked hard to be the mother her mother wasn't. And she succeeded. She was best friends with her daughters. Or, better yet, after Hannah chooses the super original pathology of having her characters be people who run from conflict or emotional turmoil, she makes sure to tell you. Over and Over.GAAAAAAAAAAH. This had nothing to redeem itself. Over the top surly Russian mom who hates her daughters but loves her super husband. Super husband who somehow overlooks a lot of emotional abuse and neglect. Stupid twin sisters who have no personality and nothing interesting or original. Irish boyfriend who has to use the words 'brilliant' 'love' and dropped g's at the end of verbs so we REALLY get that he is Irish.

As my daughter said, \"Mom, I don't think you would have liked Kristin's other books, because they're light reading for housewives. But I think you might like this book, because it's complex and has a historical bent to it.\"So, I decided to read Winter Garden, and I'm very glad that I did. The story tells of two sisters, who lead very disparate lives, but are forced to deal with each other and their mother, who had always been very emotionally negligent and cold to them, when their father dies. The mother breaks down, because - while she'd been cold and distant to her daughters, she'd been very close and warm and loving to her husband. The sisters could never quite figure out what they'd done to cause their mother to withhold her love from them, when it was obvious - by her treatment of their father - that she was very capable of loving. Why couldn't she love her daughters?What the daughters don't know and don't find out about until after their father dies, is that their Russian-born mother had lived through the hideous Siege of Leningrad and her grief and guilt about what she had to do to stay alive kept her distant from her American-born children. Now, as adults, the daughters force their mother to open up to them, which she does, telling them stories in the form of a fairy tale, until the daughters realize that she's telling a true, horrifying story. I won't say any more than this, as I don't want to give away details, but I will say that I was deeply moved by Winter Garden, and amazingly, at the end of the book, I had tears in my eyes. I have not cried reading a book since the late '90s/early 2000s, when I read A Prayer for Owen Meany. Winter Garden is not the first book I've read that discusses the Siege of Leningrad; plus, I'm familiar with this period of time, from reading about it, from a historical standpoint. I've always admired the people that survived this brutal period. I don't know how they did it. But Winter Garden does tell how one woman survived, even if she didn't begin to live again, until her final few years."}, {"userName": "Bea ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54226928-bea", "userReview": "Ufff ahora lo termino y todav\u00eda tengo los sentimientos a flor de piel!

stars, and the final chapter 3 stars - - - so I guess that, all in all, the 3 star rating is probably the most accurate. This is the second Kristin Hannah book I have read where I have actively DISLIKED the main characters throughout the first half of the book (the other was \"True Colors\"). Nina and Meredith are the daughters, Anya is the mother - - -and as someone said in an earlier review, I had the greatest urge to smack all three of them. Frankly, I deal with enough anger in my daily life to desire having those same feelings when I read. And, on top of it all, the first half of the book becomes nothing more than a major repetition of the same ugly qualities that made me angry with the women to begin with. Now - - that being said - - -the second half of the book, particularly Hannah's retelling of the siege of Leningrad, is fabulous. Unlike other non-fiction accounts of this horrible period of Russian history, this was no detached, emotionless telling of the hundreds of thousands who literally starved to death. Hannah uses the characters of Vera, Sasha and their children to bring that horror and pain to life, and to illuminate the reasons for the cold reserve adopted by the mother toward Nina and Meredith. This section is marvelous. But then we ramble on toward the final chapter. I once again agreed with an earlier reviewer; the years of neglect and cold silence would take me a LOT longer than a single cruise to eradicate, and the final tie-in with the fairy tale story was far too neat and tidy to be believable. Hannah's writing seems almost schizophrenic to me - - at times, it seems that she's content with writing the lighter chick lit that started her career on its path to the top. At other times, she seems to want to delve into the darker side of people's anger, insecurities, and general psyche. In between these two extremes, she weaves an absolutely fascinating story that nestles somewhere in the middle of the novel. If you don't mind and you have the time and patience to slosh through the rest of the book, there is something very worthwhile here."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie", "userReview": "Kristin Hannah never fails to bring a story together full of history and wonderful characters. The Winter Garden is no exception. The historical facts behind this book are ones I was not familiar with...the siege of Leningrad at the end of WW2. There were so many areas of destruction with this war and I have been introduced to so many aspects of it through several novels of late. Nina and Merideth are sisters who adored the father that was their whole world. They return home as he becomes ill and is dying and promise him that they will take care of the Mother they have never felt loved them. Over the next months they struggle to understand this woman and fulfill the promise they made to their father. Their Mother has also made a promise, to finish the fairy tale she often told them as children. But it is not a fairy tale, but the story of her life before she met their father. The sad and heartbreaking story of Vera and her family who lived in Leningrad at the end of WW 2. Of her struggles, and hopes and losses. Of why she never dared to love her children and risk the heartbreak she had felt before. This is beautifully written and the narrative goes back and forth from present day to the early 1940's in Russia at the end of the war. Tragic. There is no other word for what these people....mostly women and children went through to survive. And few did. This is the story of three women, who finally connect and learn to understand each other. I listened to the audio of this and the narration was exceptional. I could feel the bitter cold, the hunger, smell the stench and visualize the vast hopelessness that was Vera's world. Excellent historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Maricarmen Mar", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53972643-maricarmen-mar", "userReview": "Otra novela preciosa que ha escrito la autora con un final emotivo y desgarrador.

To be honest, I almost put it down at the beginning because I didn't like many of the characters, especially Meredith who pretty much turned me off instantly. Though I did eventually find myself caught up in Meredith and Jeff's story, the floundering relationship between two people who were childhood sweethearts - could their cold marriage turn warm again? But at the heart of the book is Vera's story, and that kept me turning pages. If the book had been only that story without the present storylines of the daughters and their relationships/lives it would have been worth the read as well. I admit, It was hard for me to imagine someone knowing so little about their mother's past as Meredith and Nina knew about their mother. Having let the her reach old age before finally pushing to know her better was a bit tough for me to wrap my mind around, despite how the prologue portrayed their childhood. Still, the book was an entertaining read and I appreciated getting an ARC copy and being able to try a book outside my usual reading material."}], "description": "From the author of the smash-hit bestseller Firefly Lane and True Colors comes a powerful, heartbreaking novel that illuminates the intricate mother-daughter bond and explores the enduring links between the present and the past.Meredith and Nina Whitson are as different as sisters can be. One stayed at home to raise her children and manage the family apple orchard: the other followed a dream and traveled the world to become a famous photojournalist. But when their beloved father falls ill, Meredith and Nina find themselves together again, standing alongside their cold, disapproving mother, Anya, who even now, offers no comfort to her daughters. As children, the only connection between them was the Russian fairy tale Anya sometimes told the girls at night. On his deathbed, their father extracts a promise from the women in his life: the fairy tale will be told one last time - and all the way to the end. Thus begins an unexpected journey into the truth of Anya's life in war-torn Leningrad, more than five decades ago.
