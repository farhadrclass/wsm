The writing is so eloquent and intelligent that I am always blown away by this author's work. I love the way that he/she works the history and art into each of his/her stories. I truly feel like I've learned something each time I finish one of his/her books.Aside from this author's impressive intellect, I have been taken aback by how much I have enjoyed 'The Florentine' series. Mixing fact and fiction, he/she has created a fantastical story that I have devoured. It is unlike any other vampire story that I've read and I have been captivated with this story from the beginning.That being said, there is a fine balance between providing enough details to \"build\" the story and providing enough action to keep readers engaged. I often find that this author is a little heavier on the former, resulting in longer stories that sometimes provide too much detail. This time around, I didn't find that to be the case though. In fact, 'The Roman' was a surprisingly quick read.It did take me a little time to remember exactly where the story had left off, but it all came back to me pretty quickly. Then, I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book, waiting to see how things would end up for Raven and William. Although there were plenty of predictable elements, there were also many twists that I did not see coming.In the end, it was a great conclusion to a great series. The ending was surprising for me in many ways. I didn't see it coming, but it was nice. It left me with a nice, satiated feeling."}, {"userName": "Ramona", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33526516-ramona", "userReview": "I need some time to digest what I've just read, but believe me this book is worthy every drop of emotion and excitement you put into it.Now, after finishing this series, I believe that no one could write such an amazing story like Sylvain Reynard did. It was fantastic, breathtaking, fabulous, not predictable and the list can go on forever.Since reading the first book I was totally submerged into this universe that the writer created and couldn't wait to get my hands on the sequels. Reading the Gabriel's Inferno Trilogy was an amazing experience for me and Sylvain became my favorite author because of his complexity and uniqueness.As you all now, this series is made of 3 books, The Roman being the last one and everybody was super excited to discover the faith of William and Raven. The Shadow left us in a daze and really worried about how William will survive the betrayal if his subjects and how will he save Raven from the Curia. I will not spoil anything. This book is not worth spoilers because you have to live it at a maximum intensity and assimilate the story at your pace. It was complex, with a lot of details as we are used to by Sylvain, but everything was pieced together in an amazing and flawless way. As I said before when reviewing his work, nothing here is random, everything is precisely inserted into the story and made total sense to be there. This precision and complexity made the story a 5 stars one.Beside the way the plot was described, the characters and relationship between were magnificently presented to the reader. If you loved the heroes in the first and second books, now you will become their allies and keep your fingers crossed for them to have the happy ending they deserve.Raven, as we are already used at, is amazing and more powerful then ever. Her love for William surpassed everything and although human, she was ready to fight every step of the way with and for him. I admired her so much for her courage and strong spirit, for her pure heart and feelings towards many people who didn't deserved it. She was a lesson to be learn for many, especially for William, who managed to become someone completely different in this final book.We definitely saw and evolution in William's character, because he was acting not for himself, but for Raven. He was now following his heart and for me, seeing him this way was fantastic. As clich\u00e9 as it might sound, love changed him and made him human. Although William always did the right thing for his beloved city, he now had a mission to protect Raven, and my heart was banging in my chest several time when he wanted to make the ultimate sacrifice for her.Their love story was overwhelming and intense, like not many others I've read about. They are so different, in nature and perspective, but love each other so much. I felt like I was reading a paranormal version of Romeo and Juliet, because they were ready to sacrifice everything for being together and if that thing was not possible, they wanted to keep each other safe. They healed each other and accepted the difficulties that followed once giving in to their feelings. As we are used to, their love scenes were all consuming and it is impossible not to love this couple and connecting with them on all levels. One thing that I admired at this story was the lack of predictability. This story is far from predictable, and only until you see the word \"FIN\" you can relax and just digest the story and the conclusions. I was thinking of another ending, but the writer had other plans in stored for us, thing that made me extremely happy and satisfied, because I've read something different. It was amazing, breathtaking and definitely of the best paranormal love stories I've ever read.5 stars!!

With tension building, there are numerous factions vying to unseat the Prince causing William to protect his city and most importantly, Raven. In seeking support from his biggest and most powerful ally, William executes a decision that could have grave consequences or long-lasting benefits. But with human and vampyre forces at play, trusting anyone becomes perilous. \n \u201cYou are the only trust that exists in my world.\u201d He spoke against her mouth. \u201cI trust no one else.\u201d \nBeing the Prince for centuries taught William many lessons about the capricious ways of vampyres and guarding what he loves exposes his weakness to those closest to him. Of course, William has the means, power of an old one and the mental acuity to react as needed. With their love for each other, William and Raven vow to fight together rather than be separated. Raven\u2019s unwavering strength and principled views parallel the depth of reverence William feels toward Raven leading to unconditional acceptance.\n \u201cBecause of you, love has entered my cursed existence.\u201d \nThrough the series, Raven stayed true to her beliefs despite having vulnerabilities that could have caused her to make different choices. William evolved tremendously due to his love for Raven and lessons learned in his formative years. Reading about their love and admiration for each other was heart warming. However, I would have liked to have read more about The Roman and his relationship with William, especially given the eponymous book title. From the first page, the action is nonstop due to a well-choreographed cast of characters and flowing prose. Combining Renaissance art, clandestine underground organizations and the paranormal makes for a unique plot that leads to steady character arcs and an unexpected culmination. For dedicated fans of the Florentine series, you will not be disappointed in the journey and the finale.

This ongoing paranormal romance incorporates cultural and artistic elements that sets it apart from others in this genre in my opinion, and the ending in this finale was satisfying indeed.

Combining art, religion, political struggles, an interesting vampire royalty world, and--of course--an epic love story, The Florentine Series has something for everyone, and The Roman ties all these story lines together providing the reader with satisfying closure on all fronts.Please note this series must be read in order, so if you have not yet started it, please see my review for the Raven (the first book in this series) as the below review contains spoilers for the prior books. Additionally while this series is a spin-off of the Gabriel's Inferno Series, that series doesn't have to be read first to enjoy this one--though please note that the main characters from the first series do play a minor role in this one.The Roman begins where the prior book leaves off. Raven and her sister have fled Florence believing William is dead. As they struggle to survive in route to be delivered to the Curia (a political/religious organization based out of Rome committed to eradicating the world of all supernatural beings), the sisters make an ally along the way with whose help they manage to survive.Meanwhile, William, the vampyre Prince of Florence, can think of only one way to survive the political odds that are against him, including the full wrath of The Curia. He must secure an alliance with, and therefore the protection of, the most powerful vampyre to inhabit their world--one of the few vampyre's that is older than he--the Roman (the vampyre king of Italy). However, as is always the case in a good suspenseful series like this one, you can't take things at face value, as things are not always as they first appear.Will William be able to secure the political alliance with the Roman in time to save his throne and city, as well as, his pet, who has become so much more than he ever believed possible? Moreover, can an immortal ever have HEA with a human?The struggle between opposites, such as good and evil, is ever strong in this conclusion. But remember to think outside of the box as the answers are not always black and white. As fates are determined further revelations about this mesmerizing world will continue to intrigue and entertain the reader. Moreover, the love that William and Raven feel for one another and the lengths that they will go to to protect the other is sure to tug at your heartstrings.Now I must go back and experience the series that started it all: Gabriel's Inferno. I can't wait!Source: Review copy provided for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24529485-monica", "userReview": "I was not that kind of reader, searching for paranormal romance books, that wasn't me. Although I had some interest in the movies, my faves Dracula, The Crow ( old one) and Interview with a Vampire. After a couple of Anne Rice's books I didn't have much to compare. The stories didn't mean that much to me or anything at all...Then there was a series written by Sylvain Reynard, the author of Gabriel's Inferno Series which I liked very much and I've started following SR's writing rather close with admiration.Then I thought, why not?Amazed of SR's creation, well-developed characters, this beautifully written dark and sexy underworld tale inviting us to the mysterious city of Florence, enchanting the readers along.My imagination took off. ( I wish I could fly)The Florentine Series caught my attention as you can read here... and I fell in love in the very first chapter with The Prince. I've been a loyal servant ever since. Not compelled or anything :)The Author has an incredible way to transport the readers to the story. You feel it, you are there like an extra character trying to get everyone safe. All the characters belong in the tale and they are in for a reason. Even that extra, me, or you, trying to fight Good against Evil, wishing Love with your Passion would prevail. Every life is worth living.If you didn't start reading this series yet, here is the reading order:The Prince, The Raven, The Shadow and now the release of The Roman.So back to The Roman...Yes, the final installment of the series and yes, why I am so nervous? My stomach started to hurt because I didn't want it to end. Be quiet my little heart. Oh... it's alright, right?Raven and William became my addiction, loving characters, like Gabriel and Julia who make some appearances here and there, still are so close to my heart.I've enjoyed so much to witness their love, unique and transcendent.Raven a solid and courageous character with a physical condition, if that couldn't stop her... She's my hero. How I love her !Even in the darkness she manages to conquer everyone's heart and fight for the good. She could get out of any dangerous situation just by talking to you. I don't know what William would do without her... and yet both lost so much...So now, the most intelligent and interesting character I have ever read, The Prince.I'm amazed of his qualities, how noble and how experienced in terms of finding a resolution to problems under pressure... I won't add much more, you need to read the series...In love with his city, willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of the humans and all his brethren. For someone who said he had no feelings, his humanity kept his people safe.Yet, his people were his torment and their sickening quest for power, turn his world apart.The Roman is full of intense scenes in every chapter. You'll keep turning the pages and get out of breath, I tell you! Applause to the writer!Toward the conclusion something really unexpected happens and in my first impression (first read), I wish I had more time in the book to adapt to the new situation. It felt like I lost something and wasn't ready to give up and then didn't have time to feel safe around the new and move on.I'm still processing it...In the end, I think we don't welcome changes as changes have to be. Getting out of our comfort zone, means sometimes sacrifice what is dear to us, by the time we change, we then realize it took an effort to leave the past, but it was your best decision to move forward, so we have to try to make it worth.Raven was Hope to William's Despair.Had a really good time with the Florentine series. It will be in my case, truly missed.Will I read paranormal again? I'll answer with another question :Can you match Sylvain's powerful writing? I recommend this series! You'll never know a paranormal story like this one! Don't you miss it!An intense dark tale, with Intrigue, Art, Love and Redemption.I couldn't put it down! I kept slowing my reading, felt a little guilty and got all frustrated. A bittersweet moment as I'm writing this review. I can't let these enchanting characters go.My heart hurts...Sylvain Reynard seduces, does magic to this magnificent conclusion of the Florentine Series. I wonder what's next! All I know is it's going to be set in Paris... \u00c0 bient\u00f4t  ...ARC provided by the Author or Publisher in exchange for an honest review!I've pre-order the audiobook, so I'll re-read/listen to it againby the time you are reading this long long review.I like the audible versions of the books and I've been introduced to Sylvain Reynard's work through John Michael Morgan's voice.

It wasn't a bad book. But some of the sex scenes were repetitive and clumsy in writing. And minor spoilers ahead to explain the rest.The dagger left in the hand was too obvious a mistake. I felt like shouting at the book like really, you're not going to retrieve that before...Then the defeatist attitude about the Curera (listened so not sure of spelling). He single handedly defeated the hunters. But he's fearful of the Curera when he's immune to relics? Personally after all the build up, I felt slighted we didn't get to see how dangerous the Curera was.I wanted more if this is the end about how the other major parties went on after William.The book was named the Roman though he played a small role in the book.Neither fought in the end and just gave in. It seemed at odds with their characters. Raven wanted to do this and that and not be \"a prisoner\" and complained about it throughout the book, but didn't put up a fight in the end.But the biggest, and this is personal, is the end. Although I can see how this ending played out, I read PNR for the supernatural. So the fact the ending lacked a lot of that bugged me. I felt like William and Raven fell in love despite who they were. For one to change seemed too easy of an ending. I wanted William to defeat his foes, even the Roman and make change for all. And hell, with the ending we got, where we're the babes. Anyway, I didn't hate it. But it wasn't at all what I hoped.

Reynard seduces, enchants, and thrills with this OUTSTANDING conclusion to the Florentine Series. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough!I'll be honest with you and say that I've stopped searching for paranormal romance books. They just haven't been striking a cord with me at all, so I've set the genre aside. But when there is a series written by Sylvain Reynard, it doesn't matter what genre it is...YOU READ IT! The Florentine Series is the only PNR series that have caught and held my attention in a while. I fell in love at the very beginning with THE PRINCE, and I've been a goner ever since. That being said, this amazing series MUST be read in order.THE ROMAN is the final installment of the series and my stomach was in knots because I didn't want it to end. Raven and William have become characters that are so close to my heart. Just like Julia and Gabriel (who make appearances), their love is transcendent. This paranormal romantic suspense had me on the edge of my seat begging for a happily ever after. And boy does Reynard deliver it!This enticing underground world that Sylvain Reynard has created is magical, sensual, and dangerous. It will make your heart pound and your chest ache. It's fiction that reads like non-fiction and history. It's vampyres, hunters, ferals, and old ones. Everything about this series and this final installment will have gasping and aching for so much more.If you are looking for a series that will transport you...amaze you...and devour you, look no further. If you are looking for a series to get you back into the genre of PNR, look no further. Spectacular writing, imaginative storytelling, and characters to die for, THE ROMAN and the entire FLORENTINE Series is a MUST READ!

I have loved this series from the very first book, very first word, very first chapter and do not want this to be the end. I know that Sylvain loves to kill us with suspense and this surely went right along with that norm. I feel like there was so much going on. Betrayal, love, family, surprises, angst, revenge. SO MUCH! I know that Sylvain knows how to write a book that sweeps us up and knocks us on our butts, and this one was just the same as previous books in the series! We have the Prince, Raven, The Roman, Gabriel, the vampyres, the Curia.. just SO MUCH! From all angles. I felt like it was a freight train that didn't stop until that last word on the last page! Sylvain wanted to keep us on the edges of our seats and did just that!I think what I love the most about this series, not only is the book is a romance, and paranormal-ish, but its the connection between the characters, the pull, the attraction, the desire, the love, the devotion. Sylvain has such a way of capturing it and relaying it in words that it is nothing short of captivating. You want everything to work out for these two. You fall in love even more with them as individuals, and as a couple, with this book, than you have previously. The way that Sylvain has written these two characters, this may be one of the best love stories, and series, I think I've ever read. Now, let's get back to that action and angst. I think that there were a few times in this book that I was on the edge of my seat dying to know what was coming next. I felt like I was sitting on my bed, yelling and screaming, and fist pumping, and chewing my cuticles, and I just could not stop moving around. I couldn't sit still.

En cambio, lo que obtenemos es una historia que progresa muy poco, pierde fuerza y \u200b\u200bofrece m\u00e1s preguntas que respuestas. No hay una resoluci\u00f3n a la vista y la falta de ella es como un picor debajo de la piel que no se puede alcanzar. El romano fue creado para ser esta criatura m\u00edtica en la \u00faltima entrega y yo esperaba que fuera el personaje m\u00e1s grande del mundo de los vampiros, m\u00e1s maquiav\u00e9lico que el mismo Maquiavelo (que si leyera este libro preferir\u00eda estar exiliado). En cambio, se nos da un personaje que se ha retirado de la vida p\u00fablica para disfrutar del hedonismo, que es f\u00e1cilmente manipulado por subordinados menores y petulante como un ni\u00f1o. El libro no cumple con su t\u00edtulo ya que el personaje de los romanos es, por decirlo suavemente, poco desarrollado.La Curia termin\u00f3 siendo nada m\u00e1s que exorcistas y despu\u00e9s de un poco de agua bendita y mucho rezo, \u00a1listo! No m\u00e1s vampiro William, solo un humano com\u00fan que tiene un latido del coraz\u00f3n y su alma ha sido salvada. Con m\u00e1s dinero que Dios, se retira a una isla privada con su sumisa mascota Raven .Se supone que debemos creer que Raven, cuando se le pidi\u00f3 que se quedara en Villa de William en Florencia durante la agitaci\u00f3n, rog\u00f3 que la dejen salir para ser voluntaria en el orfanato de los ni\u00f1os fue de repente contenido de pasar 4 a\u00f1os en una isla con nada m\u00e1s que su ahora-humano \"esposo\" y una contemplaci\u00f3n intermitente con respecto a la posibilidad de una vida despu\u00e9s de la vida. Mientras tanto, el romano puede o no estar volvi\u00e9ndose loco, la Curia puede ser o no ser importante en otros conflictos y Aiobhe quien se le permiti\u00f3 vivir sin raz\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de innumerables infracciones ahora gobierna Florencia y contin\u00faa en la b\u00fasqueda de William y Raven. WTF?!Ninguno pele\u00f3 al final y simplemente todos cedieron. Durante toda la lectura estaba en desacuerdo con sus personajes. Raven quer\u00eda hacer esto y aquello y no ser \"un prisionero\" y se quej\u00f3 de ello a lo largo del libro, pero al final no se opuso. Quer\u00eda que William derrotara a sus enemigos, incluso a los romanos, y que hiciera cambios para todos, pero nada de eso sucedio.Me encantaron los dos primeros libros de la serie florentina, en verdad cre\u00eda que tendr\u00eda potencial, pero su conclusi\u00f3n fue abrumadoramente decepcionante por decirlo de la manera m\u00e1s amable. Lo \u00fanico bueno de este libro es el epilogo, debido que es una escena donde aparecen mis amados, Gabriel, Julia y la peque\u00f1a Clare.P.D. El autor anuncio que habr\u00e1 un 4to. libro de Gabriel's Inferno, el cual por supuesto espero con muchas ansias, sobre eso, creo que ese libro se desarrollara al mismo tiempo que esta serie, solo espero que una vez m\u00e1s el autor no eche a perder la historia por promocionar la serie de florencia y sacar m\u00e1s jugo de la trilog\u00eda de Gabriel."}, {"userName": "Gitte TotallyBookedBlog", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7379751-gitte-totallybookedblog", "userReview": "\u2018William would stand between her and the darkness.

I have to admit to having my reservations as I just couldn\u2019t see how it was going to end well for this precious love affair, what with all the loose ends and persistent deception and double crossings.

You'll never be the same after reading stories as profound as Sylvain Reynard's. The character's development through the series is simply moving and incredibly well-developed.

Sylvain Reynard has done it again! Just when I thought I couldn't fall any more in love with SR's writing, along comes The Roman, the final book in the Florentine Series, one of the best series I have ever read and set in one of my favourite cities in the world, beautiful Florence. The Roman was everything I was hoping for. Full of suspense, surprises, and the most beautifully written love scenes that only SR can write. I smiled, I sighed, I cried and was totally consumed by this story. I didn't want it to end and am saddened to now have to say goodbye to William and Raven, two characters I have come to love so dearly. I highly recommend The Roman and the Florentine Series!

Instead, what we get is a story that progresses very little, loses steam and offers more questions than answers. No where is a resolution in sight and the lack of it is like an itch underneath your skin you can't get at. After having sampled the vampire variety from Bram Stoker to Stephanie Meyer & L.J. Smith, I felt like I had finally found my ideal vampire in Willim Malet/York. More importantly, the intrigue in the vampire kingdoms, the coups and the Curia was where my interest lay, more so than the romance between Raven and the Prince. The Roman was built up to be this almost mythical creature in the last installment and I expected him to be a larger than life character, more Machiavellian than Machiavelli himself (quite literally, in this series). Instead we are given a character who has retreated from public life to indulge in hedonism, is easily manipulated by lesser underlings and petulant like a child. The book does not live up to its title since the character of the Roman is, to put it mildly, underdeveloped.The Curia end up being nothing more than exorcists and after a little bit of holy water and mumbo jumbo, presto! No more vampire William, just an ordinary human who has a heart beat and his soul has been saved. With more money than God, he retires to a private island (The author having started the Gabriel series as Twilight fanfiction perhaps couldn't help this nod to Isle Esme) with Raven who can paint to her heart's content. We are supposed to believe that Raven, who when told to stay in William's Villa in Florence during the upheaval, begged to be let out to volunteer at the children's orphanage was suddenly content to spend 4 years on an island with nothing but her now-human beau and intermittent contemplation regarding the possibility of an after life. Meanwhile, the Roman may or may not be going crazy, the Curia may or may not be into other conflicts and Aiobhe who was allowed to live for no reason after countless infractions now rules Florence and continues to search for William and Raven.I loved the Florentine series, but it's conclusion was crushingly disappointing to say the least."}, {"userName": "Jo-The Hopeless Romantics Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30407864-jo-the-hopeless-romantics-book-blog", "userReview": "Sylvain Reynard has ended this bewitching series with a thrilling finale. \"The Roman\" was a heart stopping, stomach churning and mesmerising conclusion to William and Raven's story. I was gripped throughout every single chapter, biting my nails with my heart in my mouth. As soon as this book landed on my kindle, I squealed with excitement. I couldn't wait to step back into Florence and the paranormal world. This series has been my absolute favourite from this genre. It was jam-packed with all the things that I have come to expect from this author. Romance, passion, excitement and edge of my seat drama. I was addicted every step of the way. \n\"You are my choice, my destiny, my blessing and my curse. If I were to lose you, my life would be over.\"\nThroughout this final instalment I was desperately worried for how things would play out for William and Raven as their different worlds threatened to collide. I was so very fearful of the dangers that lay ahead for this beautiful couple. Would both of them survive? What a frightening end to the series this was. I truly forgot to breathe in places, as I was transported around Europe and into the dark underworld. I could not have predicted what was in store for William and Raven and my heart plummeted on several occasions. It seemed as though everyone was out to separate William from his beloved, Raven. As always, Sylvain Reynards writing was exquisite, hooking me in with his lyrical use of words. Sylvain turns writing into an art form. His books are truly a work of art that I want to devour again and again. The couple that was created for this amazing series has completely enchanted me from the first time they met. William and Raven made the most beautiful couple with love so powerful that I couldn't imagine it ever coming to an end. Their relationship was simply magical. Sylvain has yet again delivered another wonderful love story that has captured my heart. \n\"Love me, William, as you have always loved me. And it will be everything.\"\nIf you have been following this series, you will not be disappointed.

I cannot sit here and claim to be happy with this ending, but I had not read the epilogue or the \"3 years later\" chapter yet, and those impacted my feelings about the end.I was so disappointed by the ending of this book. I was extremely not expecting it and I just don't like it. However, I think an issue I have is that book 3 made me more interested in the actual action/story going on, than the romance, and that was an issue. The ending of this book is a beautiful and full-circle ending to the romance itself, but it does not complete all the action stories. While I think there was way too much going on in this book, I really enjoyed all the plots that intertwined with the romance. There just could not have been a happy ending to the romance any other way, so I understand the decision on the authors part, but the part of me who loved the political supernatural story is very disappointed."}, {"userName": "Kez11", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14968849-kez11", "userReview": "What a ride...What.A.Ride!!Every once in a while a novel comes along that is so profound, so compelling, it will have you reeling. \u2018The Roman\u2019 is most definitely that book.The story continues where \u2018The Shadow\u2018 left readers. Immediately, you\u2019ll be drawn back into the dark and dangerous world that is William and Raven\u2019s. But hold onto your seats and your hearts people\u2026for this is no easy ride.\u2018The Roman\u2018 is fast paced and the suspense is intense!! It\u2019s a rollercoaster of emotions as the improbable lovers fight to remain together and William desperately tries to protect both Florence and Raven.While we know \u2018The Roman\u2019 is a story about trust, betrayal, love and redemption. For me, there were two key elements that shine through, \u2018courage\u2019 and \u2018the power of love\u2019. There is no doubt that Raven is one courageous young woman, but it is William\u2019s courage that comes to the forefront in \u2018The Roman\u2019.As you follow William and Raven on their arduous journey, their emotions become yours. Anguish, fear, happiness, contentment, when the hairs on Raven\u2019s neck are raised, you\u2019ll feel them and when there are tears of sadness and tears of joy, you\u2019ll shed them.\u2018The Roman\u2018 most definitely delivers the epic ending The Florentine series deserves. In fact it\u2019s beyond epic!!Sylvain Reynard is no ordinary author. He is an exceptionally gifted storyteller, his penmanship outstanding. If you are new to his writing and this series, don\u2019t start with \u2018The Roman\u2018. The Florentine series needs to be read in sequence, so you\u2019ll need to start with the novella \u2018The Prince.\u2019Congratulations SR on a compelling ending to The Florentine series.

The ending of The Shadow left me reeling and in need of more so thank goodness SR didn\u2019t make me the wait too long. The books in this series is one continuous story so must be read in order. I urge you not to skip any of the them as all the details are essential to get the full impact of William and Raven\u2019s story. Pardon the pun but the devil is in the detail! Every page gives you more and more vital bits of information which is extremely intriguing and full of angst which I have come to expect from this author.As usual, SR continues to spoil us with the most perfect use of the English language. Reading his words just soothes my soul, I lap up each and every word! I have to admit some of the old English words used I had to look up. . . (God bless the Kindle dictionary!) However, this didn\u2019t bother me one bit. I felt it added more mystery and authenticity to the story. William \u2018The Prince\u2019 of Florence has found himself and Raven in a very dangerous situation but who can he trust to help him? Although William is an extremely powerful vampire, he really does need a trusted ally which is where the story leaves Florence for Rome. It seems he is surrounded by people who are power hungry for his throne so he goes to the one person he thinks he can trust, mmm. . . but can he? Subterfuge is the name of the game and William finds out who his allies are!William loves his beloved Florence and Raven but and it's a big BUT, can he have both? The title did have me foxed a little but this didn\u2019t detract me at all from the enjoyment of the book. Awww Raven! What a girl she was and how I loved her so! She really stood by her man. It would\u2019ve been very easy for Raven to walk away from Florence and all the troubles it brought her but no; she isn\u2019t about to abandon her guy! She may be physically fragile but she\u2019s a tower of strength for William. I\u2019ve admired her principles from the start in this amazing series. She\u2019s in it for the long haul and not once did she waver which just made me love her even more.Raven is a protector to the very end and will stop at nothing to guard her sister and William. She\u2019s been let down so much in her short life and William is the one person who has always come to her aid. Her bravery in a world she has come to know really did test her resolve but not once did she run. She has found her one true love and she will do almost anything for him and I mean almost. . . I mistakenly thought I got the ending sussed when I was around half way through the book. I\u2019m awfully good at trying to guess the outcome of a book but you got me SR! Very well played! The ending for William and Raven was astounding and fantastically executed. If you\u2019re looking for a bewitching tale of love, loyalty and exceptionally written prose then I urge you to give this series a go. SR is a master which I must applaud. Encore, encore!!"}, {"userName": "KFForever", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30566463-kfforever", "userReview": "kfforever\nReviewed by Sharon Th\u00e9r\u00e8seIt is with a sad heart but with a content soul that I say arrivederci to the Florentine series. And goodness me, the outstanding cover is the essence of scenes to take place in one of my beloved Italian cities, Roma! Once again, not only has Mr Reynard spoilt me with his scholarly prose in a magical way, but he\u2019s also cloaked mystery and riddled rhyme which has become his unique writing style. It was an absolute pleasure reading his new offering. And I must say that even though the wait between books was long, he gave me no reason to refer back to The Shadow. He gave me hints of happenings nudging this reader\u2019s memory to exactly where he wanted! Believe me, my memory is not one of the best. But with Reynard\u2019s masterly sensory details and his vibrantly painted pictures, his book came alive. In other words, his tales are woven in such a manner that regardless of whether you like this genre or not, he will convince you so easily that if you\u2019re like me and not into paranormal, after reading this series, you\u2019ll want more! Of course, by the apt-hand of SR!The Raven. How beautiful her name is in Spanish! \u201cLa Alondra\u201d. I even feel the need to translate my review into this language as she conjures up a free spirit in the best of Latin phrases, \u201cSpiritum Liberum\u201d. She flies! She is her own person; she insists her wings are not for clipping by her adored one but she is his for the giving! I say this in present tense seeing she\u2019s one of my favourite heroines from the beginning of my vampirism experience which mustn\u2019t be confused with her persona. A handicap difficult to live with never bends the Prince\u2019s desire or love for her. And thank goodness since this story wouldn\u2019t have panned out the way it did!Having been precariously left on a cliffy in The Shadows which I might add, left me totally intrigued, never could I have imagined what was in store for Raven or William. However, as their story developed, my suspicions were awoken. The crux of the matter is brought to a head when the Prince puts his faith in The Roman. You\u2019ll find out why he chose to do so and whether his decision was correct or not by reading this book.My feelings regarding The Roman. I really would have liked to have been able to delve more into this character\u2019s way of thinking; know why he acted as he did and why went out of his way to misled someone so close to him. Causes . . . I didn\u2019t think they were conflictive enough to put Florence\u2019s or the Prince\u2019s reign in danger but as always in SR\u2019s books, twists and turns abound! Nevertheless, The Roman let me down to the extent that my rating of this book was affected. I would even go to lengths of saying that the title is a tad misdirected in certain aspects of goings on. Always under the impression that The Roman was hovering in the background, I wished he\u2019d been more upfront with his wishes for peace and stability. Obviously, there are underlings who aren\u2019t true to their word making circumstances more complicated. Maybe one reaches an ancient age when those around you have to take matters in their own hands.How the Roman\u2019s supposed prot\u00e9g\u00e9e suffered in the hands of his enemy left me with no words. And my question was simple. Why! All concerned could have had what they wanted without much further ado. If there were ever an upsetting scene in this whole series, this was it. In the making of such heartbreak and quandary for his beliefs, William had no option but to trust his foe completely. When Raven\u2019s wariness of someone she had faith awoke, I was shattered beyond their betrayal. I came undone, cried alongside her and lived her heartbreak and her longing to have the love of her life safely by her side.The last chapter and epilogue. I wasn\u2019t wrong in my suspicions. The journey Raven takes is arduous, confusing and long. Nothing happens overnight but the outcome is exactly what I would expect from SR and I salute him for it! What is more, this author\u2019s round up of such an epic series is not an easy feat but my goodness me, it was what any reader would expect from him. BRAVO to you sir!

We packed our bags and on January 15, 2015, we visited for the first time the Underworld of the city of Florence in \"The Prince.\" Little we knew then what Sylvain Reynard had in mind for us because, as he mentioned in a Facebook chat a week ago, it was all part of the plan. He always knew how he wanted William and Raven\u2019s story to end. And I can\u2019t feel any more happier of the conclusion of their story in \"The Roman.\" If you want to know what \u201cthe plan\u201d was all along, you will have to read The Roman! For those who haven\u2019t read the Florentine Series, now\u2019s the time. Ask Santa to get you all the books, and witness the powerful and transcendent love story of the most improbable lovers. Two lovers who found in each other hope. Their differences only complimented each other to become a better version of themselves. Raven and William are soulmates, and their love is breathtakingly and beautifully penned through the Florentine Series.No matter if you\u2019re a new reader, or you\u2019ve been reading his stories for a while, I believe we all agree: Sylvain Reynard never disappoints. After seven books, I think it's safe to say his writing style drags you into a magical and unforgettable world. A world that once you get to experience, you don't want to let go. As always, in \u201cThe Roman,\u201d you'll end up wanting more. Will it always be this way? Always wanting more of these fascinating stories? I believe so.I also believe there\u2019s more to say in this story. Our hero and heroine deserve more, and we definitely aren\u2019t ready to let them go for good. Raven starts a new journey at the end of the book that I\u2019d love see in more detail, and be part of it. I love character growth because we can learn so much from it. And in SR\u2019s hands, we can rest assured, we\u2019ll find the wisdom and hope that sometimes we so desperately look for. Thus, I\u2019m really hoping for a fourth book in the future.The Roman is a fast-paced story full of action, angst, betrayal, sacrifice, unconditional and powerful love, a burning passion, renewed hope and redemption! Unexpected plot twists will surprise you here and there. Every word, every scene, takes you into an emotional roller coaster so deep, that it\u2019ll get under your skin like a tattoo and stay in your mind like an indelible mark. You'll never be the same after reading stories as profound as Sylvain Reynard's. His poetic and flawless writing style is pure delight to all your senses. The character's development through the series is simply moving and incredibly well-developed. William is the lover we all dream for, and Raven deserves someone like William, someone who admires and worships her as he does. His Cassita will fly in so many ways, and his love for her will spread her wings to soar. William\u2019s love for Raven will break your defenses, too. It\u2019s inevitable to not fall for William York. But life isn\u2019t perfect, and to live a love like this has a price to pay \u2026 Will they be willing to defend their love against all odds?From all SR's books in both series, in my opinion this is his best work so far. Simply fascinating. My admiration and most sincere congratulations to Sylvain Reynard. I'm in awe and completely blown away by this story.

You started to feel the anticipation in The Shadow as he fights for his city of Florence. Now he must find his Cassita. He'll have forces trying to keep them apart. The whole of the series should be read from the beginning. You begin to see the references in the final book that were unfolding throughout the series. Sylvain Reynard is an excellent story teller. He has an amazing way to intertwine, in his characters, the ability to find their redemption in his stories. It is a testament to the persona SR must be in life. We are all worthy of grace and love, that is an important theme in the Florentine series. While some look at only beauty on the outside of a person, Raven has great inner beauty that William finds, and she accepts. I, as a reader, was greatly touched by the emotion he shows in this book. He writes about great loss with such feeling. Grief is an incredible emotion. The feeling of pain, numbness and emptiness were very relatable, I have gone through this in my life.
