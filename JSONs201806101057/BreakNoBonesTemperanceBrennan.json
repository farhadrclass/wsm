I think that's the main reason I was bored with it. Tempe's in trouble again, but now she has Ryan AND Pete to help her out, which is just annoying as hell. And throw in some 'colleague' never mentioned before, and there you go, another KRs book. I hate when authors introduce a new character as a 'long-time friend' or 'long-time colleague' and yet, they've never mentioned them before, in any of the other books. So there's my review. I might be looking for a new science-mystery author soon. :)"}, {"userName": "Tiffany PSquared", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27443399-tiffany-psquared", "userReview": "\u275dFriends ask how I can bear to do the work that I do. It is simple. I am committed to demolishing the maniacs before they demolish more innocents. \u275eTempe is back, this time battling a possible serial killer on Dewees Island, SC. An unlikely place for multiple homicides, but the bodies keep turning up. But she's also battling a crisis of the heart because she's shacking up with two handsome men - her ex-husband, Pete, and her current lover, Andrew Ryan. Hashtag: Awkward!\nWhat I Liked\n-As usual, Reichs' writing is taut and descriptive. The story moves at a nice pace and the characters are all well-represented.-The story is engaging - even with all it's moving parts. There was a LOT going on with this story, but Reichs kept me interested and clear along the way.\nWhat I Didn't Like\n-There were certain depictions in this book that I didn't care for, but I won't harp on them here.-I didn't like that Tempe keeps questioning her relationship with Ryan. She's a very smart person, but in that one area, she seems incapable of analyzing available evidence.-The thousand-and-one references to Boyd the chow were distracting and a little superfluous - and I'm a dog lover. I kept wondering how he was going to play into the action since he was mentioned so much.\nWhat I Wanted More Of\n-I wanted lots more of Pete vs. Ryan!!! Their interactions were classic cockfights and I enjoyed every minute!-At the risk of not adding a spoiler here, I'll just say that I wanted a better ending.4 stars because, although it wasn't my favorite Temperance Brennan novel, it was still solid and entertaining."}, {"userName": "Belinda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45524597-belinda", "userReview": "4,25 stars - Nederlandse hardcover - genoten van deze !

I am not a huge Bones fanatic, but I do find it entertaining every now and then. The book, to be honest, bored me. What I like about the Bones TV show is that Dr. Brennan has this antisocial way about her - she doesn't really know how to interact with living people, and yet she still has empathy and she does care. That's the most endearing part about that character. In the book she's just a regular type of typical character. I don't usually say this, but I like the show better than the book. I didn't finish it so maybe I'm judging prematurely, but I was just too bored to continue. I decided about a year ago that if I'm not enjoying a book there is just no reason to keep reading it. I don't have to write a paper on it and reading is supposed to be fun.

The plot is good but seems a little far fetched and stretching reality, some descriptions implausible in my view. For example sharing a girlfriend's house with her estranged husband and her boyfriend at the same time ??????. This novel is a decent enough thriller, but it lacks style and passion.

The novel is smooth with her thought process, and it wouldn't be the same without it.Reading about her troubles between Pete and Ryan, it feels natural and completely real. Anyone in her situation would be questioning herself. I love how Reichs brings Tempe to life, like an everyday person that you could bump into on the street, no matter where you go.Again, unbelievable details in both crime scenes and crime solving. I can get over how much you're brought right into the story and you're stuck there until the end. And knowing (or reading her Author's Note) that she writes from experience is pretty close to both frightening and wonderment at the same time.

Break No Bones exemplifies this problem of Tempe's and throws in the personal issue of both ex-husband Pete and current boyfriend Ryan having to get along to help her out.The book starts in South Carolina. Tempe has been \"roped\" into teaching the field class in anthropology for the University because the woman who has taught the class for years and made it the highlight of the anthropology curriculum just upped and left for another job and, of course, the only one really qualified to teach it is Tempe. The students not only find ancient bones, which irritates the daylights out of the contractor building a multi-million dollar project but also a body that is much more recent. Now Tempe is really involved and while she gets to work with her old friend Emma and stay at her friend Anne's palatial ocean front home, she is stumped by an unusual break in one of the neck bones and several small nicks on bones the likes of which she hasn't encountered before. Other bodies start showing up some of which have similar breaks and nicks and suddenly things become much more ominous. And to add to the general confusion something is wrong with Emma, Pete shows up (with Boyd and Birdie in tow) working on a case that at first seems quite separate but may not be after all, and then Ryan comes down after things with his newly discovered daughter aren't working out up in Nova Scotia. And when Pete gets shot it's up in the air as to who's problem has come calling to \"Sea for Miles\"There's a whole lot going on this book both with the central mystery and Tempe's emotional state of mind. Not all of it gets resolved and some of the cliff hanging lines really irritate me like \"At times I wanted to reach out and take Ryan's hand. I didn't. In the time since, I've often wondered why\" and while this may be discussed more fully in future books the emotional rollercoaster Tempe (and the readers) are on because of the presence of both Ryan and Pete at \"Sea for Miles\" at points overshadows the mystery.Still the book is another solid read in the series and exposes yet another dark dirty underworld of society, this one of harvesting organs illegally, and it kept me roped in and interested until the end."}, {"userName": "Matt Schiariti", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12981352-matt-schiariti", "userReview": "Break No Bones brings Tempe back to her native Carolina. She's working a teaching dig in the lowlands when she digs up an unexpected surprise. A dead body. And not an ancient burial either, this one is quite recent. The local coroner and an old friend of Tempe's has fallen ill recently so as a favor, Tempe takes on the job of trying to identify the remains she uncovered at the dig.Enter Pete, the estranged husband. Hired by a client to see if an clinic they donate to is cooking the books, he also ends up in Tempe's neck of the woods. As it turns out, the client's daughter is the one who originally brought up the idea of the clinic cooking the books because she works there. Or should I say, workED there. She's missing. Coincidence?During all of that, Ryan enters the equation. Given the ole 'talk to the hand' treatment by his recently discovered daughter, Ryan decides to make the trip down to the lowlands to hang out with his girlfriend/lover/sometimes co worker, Tempe. Having Pete and Ryan in the same vicinity as her sends Tempe's emotions into a tailspin.Break No Bones is one of the better Tempe Brennan Novels. At times it's a little busy with keeping track of Pete's subplot and all the victims and minor players, but it's pretty well streamlined into a nice coherent, easy to follow read, while not being dumbed down. It's a smart story that's told well. Some previous Tempe Brennan novels seemed to be a little big too big and complex for their own good and resulted in a disjointed read that got tied up all of a sudden in the last couple of chapters. While not as good as Fatal Voyage or Cross Bones, Break No Bones is still among the best of the Temperance Brennan novels."}, {"userName": "Shirley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/432896-shirley", "userReview": "If you like mysteries and forenics, then this is the book for you.

This series is the inspiration behind the Bones television series. Technically, the television character really only shares her name with the book Brennan. The two characters are completely different. Reichs says that Brennan is merely at a different stage in her career in the television series. TV Brennan is at the beginning stages of her career, while the book Brennan is more mature. But from my point of view, the two characters are too dis-similar to be the same person. The television Brennan is socially inept and blunt, causing her relationships with co-workers and others to be strained at times. The book Brennan is socially more normal and has good working relationships with those around her. They are just too different to be the same woman. I prefer to use the terms \"loosely based on'' and enjoy both versions as separate entities. I enjoy both characters...and just keep them separate in my mind.So if you are a TV watcher, don't expect the book Brennan to be like Bones. And if you are a book reader, don't turn the channel when you see how antisocial the TV Brennan can be. Both versions of the character will grow on you if you give them a chance.In Break No Bones, Tempe is called to Charleston to teach an archaeology field course. Her students are digging in an ancient Native American burial ground. When they unearth a more modern skeleton, the local coroner asks Tempe to help with the investigation. The body count starts climbing, and Tempe realizes this isn't just about a recent burial in an ancient burial ground.This book left me feeling a bit meh rather than excited. The plot blows up into an international crime situation that left me a bit incredulous. I'm hoping the next book has Temperance Brennan investigating a murder or two that doesn't have to be blown up to epic proportions that push my ability to suspend reality. Amid the attempt to conjure up a case that was large scale and important, the actual mystery portion of the plot was too predictable. I had significant portions figured out early in the book. I want less intrigue and overblown plot, and more investigation, I guess.My one other problem with this book series: I find Brennan's love affair with Andrew Ryan to be annoying. Brennan is still married to her husband, but they have been separated for years. She is in a relationship with Ryan. In Break No Bones, Brennan and her husband are sharing a beach house in Charleston because both are working there at the same time. Then Ryan comes to stay at the house, too. Most of the two men's interaction within the story was immature personal comments and jealousy over Brennan. It got old really fast. Brennan and Ryan constantly fight over silly things. The outcome is usually Ryan driving off and not answering his phone for days. Really guys? How old are you? This has been dragging on for multiple books now. This isn't an edge of the seat \"will they or won't they'' romantic tension sort of thing. They already do and have... But Brennan doesn't get divorced from her husband or even seem to think about it. Their daughter is grown and on her own. If they have lived apart for years, why remain married? And Ryan still runs off every time they have a spat. And it always ends with Brennan upset because Ryan won't answer his phone. The dialogue between them is ridiculous at times. The couple either needs to get it in gear......or move on. I'm tired of this plot angle.Now that I have gotten the negatives off my chest......I want to add that I really enjoy the investigative aspects of these books. Reichs lets loose with her actual real-life expertise when it comes to explaining forensics. For me, the forensics portion of the story is what keeps me reading this series. I find it fascinating, and I enjoy the science involved in gleaning clues from skeletal remains. I roll my eyes at Brennan's private life. And the silly overblown plots at times can really get old. But the investigation and procedure involved pep the story back up and keep me coming back for the next book.My rating: 7/10Ages 16+Some sexual situations and violence, but not graphic"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4041033-chris", "userReview": "Reviewed first at Brunner's BookshelfAs much as it pains me to say this; I\u2019m officially finished reading Kathy Reichs. I was a big fan of these books since almost the beginning, but I took some time off reading them and explored what else is out there. I have given this a lot of thought and I think I have figured out why I have grown out of these books. In the last few years I have gone from reading only 3 authors to reading a ton of authors. There are plenty of women authors with female characters that are stronger and more interesting than Temperance Brennan. Don't get me wrong, I have liked Brennan for many years but I have found that Rizzoli and Isles from Tess Gerritsen, and Sara Linton from Karin Slaughter are more interesting characters. These books have also inspired the hit show Bones which is really interesting, well written and fast paced. I think because The show's episodes are an hour with commercials and I think that\u2019s what makes it work. These stories would work better in a shorter format. I hate to say it, and I don't very often, but the show has surpassed these books for me. I have thought about this review for a few days and there really wasn\u2019t anything I liked about this book. This is the third book in a row by Kathy Reichs that I have read that has been less than impressive. There was so much rambling though out the book that didn't have any purpose. Had this been edited out the story would have moved much smoother. It also irritated me that we meet a character for the first time whom is supposedly a longtime friend, (where was she in previous books) and she is struggling with health issues. I didn\u2019t feel this was really necessary other than to tie Temperance to the area she was in to work the case. There isn\u2019t any reason she would work a case outside her jurisdiction accept to help out a potentially dying friend. I\u2019m also really tired of Temperance being the clich\u00e9d damsel in distress in every one of these books. Let her stand up and smack the attacker in the face with a skull and tie him to a chair while she waits for the police. I don\u2019t know a single woman these days that would fit into the damsel in distress category. The last thing that I am really tired of in these books is the love triangle. She is always on again off again with Detective Andrew Ryan, but now we get not only Ryan, but her Ex-husband Pete in one book. If that wasn\u2019t awkward enough, all three characters are all living in the same beach house and Pete seems to be trying to win back Temperance. Are you kidding me, this was just overkill and I could have done without both characters. Get rid of Pete and Andrew as well has her constant complaining about life with and without him and this might have been a better story. After all of that the main plot didn\u2019t really matter, it was forgettable and had very little entertainment value. I used to love these books and would recommend Kathy Reichs to everyone I knew who read. Now I am ripping this book apart and trying to not be too harsh.This kind of feels like when you grow apart from a friend from your childhood; you remember the good times and wish them well but part ways. Kathy Reichs is a great writer but I have just out grown her style. This book was really predictable and disappointing. Reichs still knows how to set scenes well and she is great at the descriptive stuff like describing background and what leads up to a find. She just got a little too descriptive in this book and it was dry. I have read 2 of the 4 YA series she has written and 12 of the 16 Temperance Brennan books, this one was the last one I will read. I give this book 1 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/938229-david", "userReview": "This is the first of this series that I have read and I have to say while it was a decent enough read it had some elements that I despise in books.First, I hate the \"Murder, She Wrote\" syndrome that is rampant in many television programs today. What do I mean by that? I mean that a hero or heroine ends up in an investigation that the police would never permit, much less cooperate with. For example, when you watch an episode of CSI where the technicians participate in the interrogations-- you've just seen the \"Murder, She Wrote\" syndrome demonstrated. When you see a medical examiner doing detective work-- you are seeing that syndrome.Temperance is allowed WAY TOO MUCH leeway in acting not as a medical examiner, but as a detective. Second, I dislike \"The Rookies\" mechanism. This is also named after a 70's television program called \"The Rookies\" in which almost every episode involved some personal involvement on the part of one rookie or another. For example, the cops would be investigating a series of robberies and the wife of one of the cops would meet one of the robbers and befriend them via her job at the hospital. In this case, Temperance's ex-husband is investigating a matter that has almost direct bearing on the particular mystery Temperance comes up against. Completely foolish, in my opinion. Finally, there was the \"FAT FACTOR\" that wasn't nearly as annoying as Robert Parker's constant references to food in the Spenser novels. In this one, it was more than Reich's was trying to name real local hangouts and give them some good publicity as well as establish a base of reality for her setting, so it wasn't too bad, but it did feel contrived in at least one or two spots. Maybe they gave her a meal for mentioning them.. lol...What did I like about the book?There was a decent mystery and decent enough twists and turns to keep me interested. Nothing overly spectacular, but enough to keep the reader guessing a bit.There were a number of references to old movies and those were interesting and gave the characters a touch of depth. but only a touch.Reichs does know the place for strong language. It doesn't drip and flow from the mouths of every character and when it is expressed it makes a point. I appreciated her balance in this area, as most writers today write as if they get a bonus payment for each \"F bomb\" or pile of excretion that flows from their characters mouth. Reichs does use a bit of strong language, but it always fits the character using it and the situation.. and that's a real hurdle for a good writer to overcome. I didn't see any real depth of character in this novel. I couldn't even get into the mind of the main character to find what really motivates her outside of friendship and loyalty. I cannot picture how she dresses, what she likes to do (besides work) or any other real detail that would give her depth. In other words, she had about as much depth as Arnold's Terminator did in that series of movies. She seemed programmed to do everything she did, though she did express feelings and even weep. I don't think I will be a read fan of this series."}, {"userName": "Donna Davis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11510694-donna-davis", "userReview": "Kathy Reichs can spin a good yarn, and sometimes I learn things I didn't know. She is a second tier among my favorite writers, however, (and I am applying this to almost everything she has written, so if I see an exceptional book, I'll write another review; otherwise, this covers them, because a good friend keeps giving them to me, and when they are free, I read them anyway).Flaw #1: The science lecture. When I read the obvious other writer in this category, P. Cornwell, I feel as if I have inadvertently learned something without the story slowing. Reichs, on the other hand, pulls out her lecture notes and gives me half a dozen pages of way more science I need in the midst of a would-be thriller. Snooooore.Flaw #2: So far, at least five of her books have the same formulaic threat-enhancer in the plot, which is supposed to create greater investment (on our parts) on the story's outcome. I've gotten to where I waited for it, and at one point when I found it, I threw the rest of her stuff in a back shelf until I could stand to read her books again. Here we go. The Killer (violins get faster, louder) has [insert precious, beloved individual, some of whom we have NEVER HEARD OF till Reichs needed a new log to toss on the fire, here]. THEN--oh yes, it does get worse--we get the reminiscence paragraph. Something like this: 'Memories blur my eyes as they rocket through my mind...person X with her first date, wobbly in high heels, but glowing with pride and youthful loveliness. Person X, screaming with rage when I drove home drunk. Person X, holding my hand when I'd had brain surgery and had my entire cerebellum removed. How could I ever, ever go through life if something happened to person X...and it was MY FAULT???' (pass the air-sickness bags around).Flaw #3: I list this one last because it is unavoidable in some ways, but for some reason, it seems harder to buy into the premise with this writer than with Cornwell. It is the fact that forensic anthropologists do NOT tote guns, conduct illegal searches, or legal ones alongside a cop (most likely one they are in love with)...it just hits my plausibility bone so hard it hurts. Excuse me? ANOTHER one of them has you in the trunk of the car? Yes, once again, it happens to P. Cornwell's characters too, but there, I have been sold the premise long ago, and she has my full attention. With Reichs, I find myself thinking, \"Oh REALLY?...oh, well, I'm 75% done, may as well finish it.\"Nevertheless, there are worse novels, if you are really hankering for a mystery. Our favorite writers cannot write as quickly as we can read, darn it, and when I have read everything written by the writers I love best, then I turn--reluctantly--to Reichs. The books are usually free to me, and she is usually still going to be a better read than the mysteries where a pet solves the crime, or the caterer or ordinary housewife just oh-gosh-did-it-again outwits entire police forces. So...if you just can't find anything else, and you like mystery/thriller type books, I recommend this as a lukewarm last resort."}], "description": "Following the tremendous success of \"Cross Bones, \"Kathy Reichs explores another high-profile topic in Break No Bones -- a case that lands forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan in the middle of a gruesome international scheme. Summoned to South Carolina to fill in for a negligent colleague, Tempe is stuck teaching a lackluster archaeology field school in the ruins of a Native American burial ground on the Charleston shore. But when Tempe stumbles upon a fresh skeleton among the ancient bones, her old friend Emma Rousseau, the local coroner, persuades her to stay on and help with the investigation. When Emma reveals a disturbing secret, it becomes more important than ever for Tempe to help her friend close the case.The body count begins to climb. An unidentified man is found hanging from a tree deep in the woods. Another corpse shows up in a barrel. There are mysterious nicks on bones in several bodies, and signs of strangulation. Tempe follows the trail to a free street clinic with a belligerent staff, a suspicious doctor, and a donor who is a charismatic televangelist. Clues abound in the most unlikely places as Tempe uses her unique knowledge and skills to build her case, even as the local sheriff remains dubious and her own life is threatened.Tempe's love life is also complicated. Ryan, her current flame, has come down to visit her from Montreal, and Pete, her former husband, is investigating the disappearance of a local woman -- and he and Tempe are staying in the same borrowed beach house. Ryan and Pete compete for her attentions, and Tempe finds herself more distracted by her feelings for both men than she expected.\"Break No Bones \"is a smart, taut thriller featuring the kind of high-stakes crime that makes the headlines every week.
