Pinkwater waxes eloquently on his boyhood, his weight, writing and art, teaching writing and art, and owning befriending dogs.No surprise here, but my favorite essays involved food and memories of great meals shared.Here Pinkwater talks about an eatery from his youth:Grease was the motif at Fred's. Instantly I would enter the place, a fine mist of grease suspended in the air would adhere to my eyeglasses--diffracting the light--so I always remember Fred's as a pointillist painting.And here is the story of a trip he and his father made to a Jewish restaurant in Warsaw, where they were served an eight-course meal:First there was scalding hot chicken soup--minimum fifty percent fat. Delicious.Chopped liver, glistening with schmaltz. My father inhaled it.Third was some kind of herring. I dropped out after that. I knew another bite would kill me. Roast chickens followed. Carps' heads, jellied calves' feet, stuff I'd never seen before. The two old guys worked steadily. They took on more cholesterol than the average Greenland Eskimo gets in a month. They both lived through it. Afterward, my father and I were in the street. He was chewing a toothpick. \"Dat vas good Jewish cooking,\" he said. \"Don't tell your mudder ve vent here.\"I'd rate most of the essays between 3 and 4 stars, but because Pinkwater makes me want to pinch his cheeks (all four of them!), I'll award him the higher score."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/355071-karen", "userReview": "This is one of my favorite books of all time. I bought this when I was eight years old at a Pinkwater book signing at Brentano's at the Poughkeepsie Galleria. In addition to being hilarious and insightful, this book is one of the most useful, unpretentious and underrated guides to becoming a writer or artist of any kind (and it offers plenty of bonus tips on animal husbandry and training, world traveling, model airplane building and grease consumption)."}, {"userName": "Hannah Garden", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1031706-hannah-garden", "userReview": "I was reading this in bed last night and laughing 0UT L0UD.

It's a wonderful little collection of short essays, originally read by Pinkwater on NPR. Hilarious, bite-sized anecdotes about his family, his dogs, his career, adventures in Africa, adventures in eating. I love Pinkwater!"}, {"userName": "Eero", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8783250-eero", "userReview": "This was a Kindle freebie I got because of a shout-out at Boing Boing.Like the recently read Dalek I Loved You, this is a humorous memoir by someone I had never heard of before reading the book. There are some differences. Pinkwater is of an earlier generation, and this book is a collection of short pieces written for radio or print, and does not really have an unifying theme as such. He writes about things like dog-training, building model airplanes as a kid, being fat, the general absurdities of everyday life and so on. He is also funnier.Since I started reading ebooks, a certain trend has become even more noticeable. I don't feel connected to other people by what I read. Even before, I had gotten into the habit of picking up cheap paperbacks with interesting-looking covers and promising blurbs from people like Stephen King, or lending similarly eye-catching books from the library. Now that I have gotten really into electronic books, I have a large backlog of freebies and paid books from Kindle, and theoretically would never have to set foot in a library or a bookstore for the rest of my life. I feel at once overwhelmed by the abundance and more isolated than ever before.I originally picked this book because it was free, and because Cory Doctorow wrote about it favourably at Boing Boing.But who I am going to recommend it to? I don't presume to think the people I know would like it, or any of my reading choices. So I write reviews that are read by no one."}, {"userName": "Christopher Bunn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4636657-christopher-bunn", "userReview": "I first discovered Daniel Pinkwater when I was a young boy, wandering the stacks of the Steinbeck library in my hometown of Salinas. The first few books of his that I read (The Magic Moscow, The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death, and The Worms of Kukulima) were a revelation. Pinkwater's fiction was a breath of fresh air unlike any other I had inhaled before, flavored with late-night hot dogs piled high with bright green relish, illicit chili, and avocados (of course!).Who knew the mysterious avocado could be a literary star?Decades later, I still love and read his fiction. After all, being a child, in the best of senses, is a state of mind.Fish Whistle, however, is the first non-fiction book of Pinkwater's that I've read. It is a compilation of NPR radio essays that he wrote and recorded over the years. They range from the quite funny to the somewhat serious. His recollections of family and school and wandering about Chicago late at night are, to my sensibilities, hilarious, particularly the bits about his incomprehensible Polish father. Having read most of his fiction, it was a revelation to see how he used his own life to weave his fiction. Eccentric uncles, delightfully fat friends, the cranky hot dog guy, opinionated Mamalute dogs...strange and wonderful characters wander through his musings like the crazy neighbors you always wished you had.To be honest, this book is what David Sedaris should be writing, but isn't. If you enjoy gently humorous and random commentary on life, you'll enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Robert Cohen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20667282-robert-cohen", "userReview": "Those of you who have been listening to All Things Considered on NPR know that the years 1974 to 1979 were the Golden Age of ATC. Why? Mostly because the very best hosts in ATC history, Susan Stamberg and Bob Edwards, presided. But during and beyond those memorable years, ATC hosted a wide variety of brilliant commentators, folks whose daily audio essays on any subject they happened to find interesting, spiced up the broadcast. They were the sort of thought pieces that you waited an entire hour to hear. The commentators included Vertamae Grosvenor, Donald McCaig, Andrei Condrescu, and Bailey White. And of course Daniel Pinkwater.This book is a collection of approx. 70 of the best of Pinkwater's audio essays. Pinkwater's writing is pithy, funny, erudite, wry, poignant, and self-effacing. At times, he could easily rival Jean Shepherd for waxing rhapsodic about childhood. This is thoroughly enjoyable commentary. Even if you are not old enough to remember Pinkwater on ATC, read this book. It proves that the art of the personal essay is not, afterall, dead ."}, {"userName": "Saul", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9315194-saul", "userReview": "I would sum up the book like this: Humor mixed with poignant words of wisdom till the last drop. A wonderful book.Not every story has the same level of humor but I certainly laughed my buttocks off at times. Pinkwater is a YA author, but proves quite admirably that he can write entertaining stories for adults (i.e. big kids). \"Gaudeamus Agita\" was especially memorable in this respect. It's one of the jewels tucked away inside the book, and reminds me of the experiences I had in the college. The epiphany of learning, and further makes me believe that Mr. Pinkwater is a great intellect of our time. Had he not been taught a great many things throughout his education, he would have, most certainly, figured everything out by himself."}, {"userName": "Laurah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/776264-laurah", "userReview": "The first time I read \"Young Adult Novel\", somewhere around 1992, it totally fn changed my life. I didn't read anything else by Pinkwater until 1997, when my friend Delancey turned me on to \"The Big Orange Splot\". In the next few weeks, I read at least twenty of D.M.P.'s books and this was one of them. I found him to be brilliant and I was enthralled by every single word. Upon rereading it recently, I still loved it, but more like getting it after a long period of chastity; I was totally satisfied, it wasn't as great as I remembered."}, {"userName": "Joshua Gross", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4296574-joshua-gross", "userReview": "All the essays in this collection are short. Some are more interesting than others, some are funnier than others, some are more insightful. I learned a little more about one of my favorite authors and about dog training and malamutes, the world of childrens book publishing and interesting food, and was surprisingly interested in an essay about airplane model building in the olden days. I also enjoyed the essay on differentiating between Moslem fundamentalists and terrorists. It was quite an assortment of topics, most too short for any real resonance, but they were almost always entertaining."}, {"userName": "Lezley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12994619-lezley", "userReview": "This was linked from Boingboing.net, and was free, so I thought I would give something different a go. I thoroughly enjoyed it, moving from short observational stories, short but sweet commentaries, through family memories. It made me smile and chuckle and sigh, and it was nice to take my time and think about the stories, which is why I do like books of short stories. I would highly recommend it.

(It was free on Kindle a few months back.)It's charming as heck and occasionally quite wise, well worth a read if you\u2019ve enjoyed any other Pinkwater. But the main thing I took away was that the Chicken Man, a central character from _Lizard Music,_ was... apparently 100% real?!!?!!?!
