It has a gripping opening scene, but then the story flounders so much that I got frustrated and finally abandoned it midway through.I picked up this book for two reasons: First, I had really liked Vendela Vida's novel The Diver's Clothes Lie Empty, and second, because I recently read a column by Vida in The New York Times in which she discussed the overlap between truth and fiction. It turns out that the incident of a woman having her bag and identity stolen at a foreign airport, which is what sets the plot of Diver's Clothes in motion, really happened to Vida. The incredible story that opens And Now You Can Go also happened to Vida.The opening scene is that a young woman, Ellis, is walking through a park in New York City when a man with a gun approaches her and says he wants to die, but he doesn't want to die alone. They sit on a park bench, and, with a gun pointed at her head, Ellis nervously starts talking about the good things to live for, including poetry. This catches the gunman by surprise, and Ellis starts reciting some poetry, then offers to take him to a nearby bookstore and show him more poems. The gunman agrees, but then runs away, leaving Ellis alone and unharmed.I had the benefit of reading that scene knowing that a similar incident had happened to the author, and it gave the prose even more power. After she escapes, Ellis is interviewed by the police, and she tries to find comfort in her work and her friends, but she flails and flits from one guy to the next. The novel didn't have chapters, just a series of short scenes, and these vignettes didn't always flow well. At times the scenes were jarring in how they jumped from one to the next, and I had to regularly go back and reread a page or two, trying to figure out what I had missed. But I hadn't missed anything \u2014 the plot was just that jumpy.The blurb on the book jacket indicates that eventually Ellis gets back into the swing of life, but I didn't have the patience to wait around for it. Maybe you will like this book more."}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38727943-jenna", "userReview": "2015 was the year of Vendela Vida for me; I discovered this author's books and can't get enough of them.Having read several of her more recent works before getting around to reading this, her debut, I was already aware that Vida writes variations on a theme. That theme goes a little something like this: woman is confronted with shocking news or experience that jolts the foundation of her identity and is somewhat isolating, then seeks to develop coping, self-soothe, restore equilibrium and sense of self. Strenuous exotic travel usually plays some role in some part of this, but Vida is also a master of detailing the day-to-day and uncovering the epic nature of the taken-for-granted quotidian grind.The formula I just detailed is reductive, but make no mistake about it: Vida is not formulaic, and this novel is magnificent. Ellis, or El, a young art history grad student at Columbia, has a brief, violent encounter with a man in Riverside Park. (I won't say more about the encounter so as to avoid spoilers, but I want to clarify that it does NOT involve sexual violence. Gendered violence: now perhaps.) El creatively (literally) survives the encounter, yet it alters her relationship with herself and with virtually everything in her life, especially with those in her limited social circle of students, school personnel, and building superintendents - and, of these, especially with men, including current, past, would be and erstwhile \"boyfriends.\" The book provides a wonderfully realistic depiction of post-traumatic stress and especially the isolation and anger a survivor might experience when confronted with others' discomfort with the violence, which manifests in a spectrum of ways from victim-blaming to offers of violent vengeance. We learn that Ellis's immigrant mom named her for Ellis Island, and the name is significant: we quickly see that, just like the needy man in the park, other men in her life seem to try to colonize her or to project upon her their often violent wants and desires, whether spiritual, physical, or existential. Ellis is initially rather passive, but learns through her violent encounter and throughout her recovery process to better discern the intentions of the men around her and to absolve herself of the responsibility for being their \"promised land.\" Once Ellis begins to see herself as less of a vehicle and more of an agent, she is able to switch focus from her perceived personal weaknesses to her personal strengths - from \"what about her made her a victim\" to \"what positive qualities and powers of hers allowed her to survive.\" And from there, she is able to attain healing and to think in sophisticated and perhaps controversial ways about forgiveness.This all sounds very heavy, but I should mention that Vendela Vida books are also fucking funny, and fun. They are suspenseful page-turners like the best of genre fiction, and I suppose they are indeed literary psychological thrillers. In fact, I might say they transcend page-turning; I've read three of her books and noticed the same phenomenon each time: the book reads so easily and effortlessly that it seems to be reading itself. They are really immersive and remind me of a great cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 film in which the whole thing is one long smooth single camera shot. Reading Vida's books reminds me of the feeling you get in those dreams where you can fly."}, {"userName": "Julie Ehlers", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120450-julie-ehlers", "userReview": "I think And Now You Can Go suffered from first-novel syndrome, at least for me. Unlike Vida\u2019s later books, this one seemed to obfuscate purely for the sake of making things seem more complex. Why the unnecessary fly paper in Ellis\u2019s apartment, for example? Why does she keep attracting random men in the wake of her traumatic experience, and why does she spend time with them? In her situation I\u2019d be more inclined to stay away from random men for a while (and I think Vida\u2019s later heroines would feel the same). It\u2019s definitely possible there\u2019s a deeper psychological explanation that I\u2019m missing, but the whole thing felt rather aimless to me\u2014and when Ellis finally does go on a trip, it felt not only a bit incongruous to me, but also unconvincingly sentimental, the redemption somewhat forced. I don\u2019t want to be too hard on this book, though\u2014it\u2019s not bad, and I\u2019m not sorry I read it. But I am glad it wasn\u2019t my first Vida novel, because on the basis of And Now You Can Go I may never have checked out her others.Disclaimer: I read this novel a few months ago and it is entirely possible that nothing I\u2019m saying about it is accurate.

I'll say up front that of course I didn't want to like it, or, specifically, I didn't want to like Vida's writing, because I hate her self-aggrandizing, egotistical, greasy-headed special snowflake douchebag of a husband, and therefore by close association she had to suck too.But I'm not entirely convinced that she does suck. The book has it's faults -- it flouders in parts and doesn't flow; Vida leaves the narrator's age in key scenes vague, which is in turn confusing for understanding of the timeline; there's pockets of information missing that are not \"fill-in-the-blanks-without-realizing-it\" types, they're more the \"WTF happened?\" type, where you flip a page or two back to see if you've missed something, figured out that you hadn't, and felt disgruntled with the author for being careless.Basically, there were parts of it that I kind of wanted to write up, workshop-style.Also, believe-ability....not so much. I feel sorry for the narrator, but I very much lose interest in her situation, and I suspect that in real life, all the people we see circling around her in the novel (and somehow, they all seem to show up at exactly the prescribed and dramatically appropriate times...) would lose interest too. She was approached by a man in a park with a gun, then he left. The book is trying to be about the psychological after effects of that, but maybe it should have been shorter. Like a short story. But: Vida does a good job of keeping things very immediate feeling, which I like. There's not hemming and hawwing in the narrative about what it all means. Some of the dialogue is clunky, but sometimes that also makes it more real, which was definitely needed."}, {"userName": "Wesley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82919-wesley", "userReview": "There is something beguiling to me about all three of Vendela Vida's novels. I'm no longer all too young; I've never been female; nor have I had my life yanked out from under me in any irrevocable way. But I can identify quite clearly with searching for some form of transcendence and there's something at play in Vida's work, some hard to pin melancholy that is infused with a vague but comforting certainty. A guarantee of perseverance (or, shudder to think, redemption) which fully fleshes out her protagonists. Intelligent, emotionally rewarding fiction at its best."}, {"userName": "Kasey Jueds", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2571904-kasey-jueds", "userReview": "In a way, I could recognize this is a well-written book, but it also seemed indistinguishable to me from a lot of contemporary fiction: first person, present tense, main character with a somewhat ironic outlook on life and some-but-not-too-much self-knowledge... also a main character who never seemed real to me, and for whom it was hard to work up a whole lot of sympathy."}, {"userName": "Shana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15532432-shana", "userReview": "I love that Vida's writing reads like a conversation with a friend.

There was something about her reticence to share what she was going through emotionally that made me not relate to her as much, and in the end, I came to see this as a sort of brilliance in character development; not even the reader gets to know what she's going through because she can't articulate it and parse it in her own head.

I read this in the van on our way back from Portland. It's not a long read, but I really liked it. It immediately starts with the main character being held by gunpoint and the rest of the book is how she deals with it after. The main character reminded me a little of Esther from the Bell Jar, but then I was wondering if that's just because we don't get a lot of well written books from the perspective of young women? Vida wrote Away We Go, and this book has some of the same humor in darkness that I love so much. It's strangely inspiring in a not at all heavy handed way.

The story, about a woman who is psychologically stunned after being held up at gunpoint, sounds heavier than it is. Ellis' vulnerability after the shock turns her into a magnet for strange and mostly laughable responses from her friends, most of whom are really selfish acquaintances - esp. men who jockey to take advantage of her. Her numbness is a good foil for the comedy aspect but it's also tragic as you realize she has been numb all along.

I get her and Heidi Julavits confused. Also, Jonathan Safran Foer is married or engaged to someone who is a writer, but I've forgotton who. But not Vendela Vida. Is that her real name? ANYCG is about Ellis, a 21-year-old art history graduate student new to New York City. Walking in the park one afternoon, she's accosted by a man with a gun. He wants to kill himself, but doesn't want to die alone. Ellis tries to cajole him with half-remembered poetry, tries to coax him back to the bookstore she just left. He seems to shake off his suicidal funk and runs away. The strange event leaves her shaken and uncertain. She seems a somewhat quirky, drifting figure to begin with, and now she's unmoored. Seeking some kind of tether, she lets several unsuitable suitors swirl around her -- the ex-boyfriend who slammed his car into a tree when she decided to leave him, a former junkie who smells like soap, a raucous ROTC cadet. Ellis drifts home and accompanies her mother on a weeklong medical mission to the Philippines. Finally she is forced to confront her attacker and passes up the chance for revenge. It all goes back to her father, who inexplicably abandoned the family when she was a child and unceremoniously returned four years laters. Ellis tells Sarah that by the time he came back, she and her mother and sister had already forgiven him, and she found she had forgiven the park attacker as well. In the end Ellis, the child of immigrants, sets out for Ireland to join Sarah. The writing isn't irritatingly quirky, but the story is ultimately as insubstantial as Ellis seems to be. She's Jell-O in search of a mold. Does this girl have any goals? Without them, setting off to Ireland seems more like an attempt to find refuge than an effort attempt to get on with her life. After all, she's not setting out alone to study art in Paris, which might make sense; instead, she's going to hang out with her best friend. Maybe drink some Guiness, maybe exchange a flock of Irishmen for her posse of stateside admirers."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5124797-alicia", "userReview": "\" And after we've spent time together like this, we run fast, with long strides~ struggling to increase the distance.We don't look back until we have news to report.

In literature and film you see a lot of men that run away from problems and relationships, but less so the females. I was a huge fan of the film \"Away We Go\", which she co-wrote with Eggers, and I found it interesting that she created a piece of that film (the fruit hanging from the fruit tree) from a throwaway line in this book. And borrowed it beautifully. It's always fun to see a writer improve upon his or her original impulse."}], "description": "A gun is pointed at 21-year-old Ellis as she walks through a New York park. Although she escapes unharmed she is left psychologically reeling. Over the next few weeks Ellis keeps everyone at bay: the police, suitors who want to save her, and the university therapist who hints that her sweaters are too tight. But when Ellis accompanies her mother, a nurse, on a mission in the Philippines, she finds the life - even if held up - cannot be held back, and neither, finally, can she.", "title": "And Now You Can Go", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140279.And_Now_You_Can_Go", "average": 3.29, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347679229l/140279.jpg", "reviews": 121, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36347.Vendela_Vida", "name": "Vendela Vida"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Novels", "Contemporary", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19912538-and-now-you-can-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4724147-and-now-you-can-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7921216-and-now-you-can-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25017327-e-adesso-puoi-andare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64482.Let_the_Northern_Lights_Erase_Your_Name", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23590710-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6920816-the-lovers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149908.The_Believer_Book_of_Writers_Talking_to_Writers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149907.Girls_on_the_Verge"]}
