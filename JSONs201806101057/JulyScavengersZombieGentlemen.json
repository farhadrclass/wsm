Scavengers: July is a roller coaster full of action, adventure, horror and romance! I was immediately swept up into the fast-paced storyline and the interesting setting of the story itself. To my knowledge, I\u2019ve never read a historically set, Zombie romance, so I was immediately intrigued by the premise of the story. I\u2019m glad I took a chance and read this book because for such a short story, it really pacts a lot of punch and I loved every minute of it. Since I believe the blurb does an outstanding job describing the book, I won\u2019t rehash it, but I will explain the reasons why I really enjoyed this novella.I thought the storyline was very creative and well-told. I like the author\u2019s descriptive storytelling ability, and I thought the setting itself is almost like a character in the book. It\u2019s definitely not the way I\u2019ve pictured a historical setting and I loved it. It can be dark, scary and dreary, and although there is definitely a horror aspect to the story, it\u2019s not totally overwhelmed by it. There is still a fairly strong romantic aspect to it also.Another reason I really loved this book was the two main characters. At first glance, both heroes look to be totally opposite, and I wondered how they would really relate to each other. But as the storyline progressed, the chemistry between them becomes very strong and intense between them. I like that they truly began to trust in each other and both men are very likeable and sexy in their own way. Also, the sexual tension between them was smoldering throughout the book, and when they finally give into their desires, I swear my computer screen practically steamed up! To me they\u2019re almost like two wrongs that make a right and I loved every moment they had together in the story.I end of the book definitely left me wanting more! I can\u2019t wait to read more about these characters and see how everything turned out. This is definitely one of the most interesting and creative series I\u2019ve read this year and one I could easily become very addicted too."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39044849-elena", "userReview": "That was delicious!Believe me, ladies, I don't usually read steampunk and such but...  James and Ira. Were.

I always say, I have a love/hate relationship with them, because I can never just stay away. So when I had the opportunity to read about the creepies, mixed in with the man love. I was on it like white on rice. In all honesty as much as I wanted a bit more, I really did enjoy Scavengers: July.James Hurst is desperate to replenish his funds when they start to run low, and as the saying goes \u201cdesperate times calls for desperate measures\u201d. The time is 1887 and after a devastating plague, most human have become flesh-eating zombies. James must now go off into his lands that are over run with the undead and in order to accomplish his mission he must get the help of mercenary Ira Russell.The men leave the city walls in search of a fortune hidden in one of James old estates, but before the jewels, there are some other things of value he must get his hands on. Seriously, James should have just head for the jewels. Seems zombies\u2019 wanting to feast on his flesh isn\u2019t nearly as frightening as it should be. While fighting of zombies, and retrieving \u2018art of utmost importance\u2019, the men find time to share a sexy interlude (seriously man freaking zombies).I really did enjoy reading this short, but I had few niggles which knocked the .5 in making this a 4PO. I wanted more background on the plague. I know it was meant as a short offering, but I am curious about the how the plague came along, and how life was before it wiped out almost everyone. I wanted a bit more background on Ira, he\u2019s all clothed in mystery (mercenary I know) but I really want to know if he lost anyone in the plague.Overall, I really liked it and look forward to reading the next instalment. Scavengers has really captured my interest, and I want to read more about the things I love to hate zombies.Warning: Do not have sex when you might possibly be attacked by zombies. You might lose some very important parts. No actual parts were lost in this book (luckily)."}, {"userName": "Eisheth", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4860798-eisheth", "userReview": "Steampunk zombies, WHAT??

I only disagree with the first chapter being sort of a teaser/preview of the whole story with the second one taking the plot back by two days but this is a matter of taste, I suppose. Characters are incredibly alive, their dialogues are sparkling and giving many information about their personalities. The two leads are very likeable and I could even put up somehow with their roles in bed being (at least for now) rigidly codified.Action scenes are generally fast-paced and good, only a bit confused in some sentences where writing does not manage to covey what exactly it is happening. I detected two or three grammar mistakes that must have escaped proofreading, nothing serious.The story can stand on its own but clearly screams for a sequel."}, {"userName": "France-Andr\u00e9e", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11134283-france-andr-e", "userReview": "That totally lived up to my expectations. There's a mix of three of my favorite things : 19th century setting, m-m romance and zombies, what more could I asked?

Hey, steampunk, zombies and steamy gay sex, what's not to like. The book is a little short, so the worldbuiling gets left behind a bit. Usually I'm all over a good, in-depth world, but it worked well, regardless. Probably because the basic concepts are so well known already, you don't really need to expand on them to make yourself understood.Also, the world does not feel lacking or lacklustre so much as just unexplained. Maybe the following books in the series will shed more light.I liked the characters, they where pretty likeable to me and I adored the contrast between the two. The dynamic is pretty hot and I liked how Ira teases poor James. It's kinda cute, even though Ira doesn't seem the kind of guy who does cute.The whole affair seems to be ripped out of the rest of the plot a bit, though, like a sex scene got transplanted into a different book it doesn't quite belong to.But that's probably also due to the shortness of the book. In any case I'm eager to read the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Aleksshi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18230365-aleksshi", "userReview": "'Scavengers: July' is an interesting position in M/M novels, especially for steam-punk lovers. It has great climate thanks to very realistic surrounding descriptions. What I love the most is character creation. Nowadays there are many M/M genre books and very often the main characters are just plain \u2013 their personalities are strictly sweet or strictly raw etc. what never lets you treat the book seriously. In comparison Scavengers' James and Ira seem more real thanks to the richness of their characteristics. Even though I love this novel, it has to be said that it is also a very specific one. I think it is hard to be indifferent about it \u2013 you ether love it or hate it.
