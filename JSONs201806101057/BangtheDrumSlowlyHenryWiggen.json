The second and best of Mark Harris's Henry Wiggen books, which the Bison imprint of University of Nebraska Press has brought back into print (though you can still get the paperback containing the three titles from the '50s for < $5 used).

BtDS is a study in manhood as exemplified by Henry Wiggen, star left-handed pitcher for the major league New York Mammoths. Twenty-four-years-old and intent on winning the division pennant (there were no wildcard playoffs back then), Wiggen carries himself with the maturity of a professional. He enjoys a good time, is genuinely happy to be married with a kid on the way, and keeps one eye locked on his own future. Wiggen\u2019s outsized authenticity comes through frequently, as when he\u2019s haggling for a contract: \u201cI rather play baseball than anything else,\u201d he says. \u201cI do it best. I like the trains. I like the hotels. I like the boys. I like the hours and the money. I like the fame and the glory. I like to think of fifty thousand people getting up in the morning and squashing themself to death in the subway to come see me play ball.\u201d Wiggen\u2019s best friend is a friendly, wide-eyed innocent named Bruce Pearson, who is a ham-and-egger catcher on the team. After Bruce is diagnosed with a terminal illness, Arthur goes to extra trouble to look after his doomed friend, keeping his condition a secret from other players and (especially) the owners. It is feat of humanity, loyalty, bravery, friendship, and fellowship, and it informs\u2014 almost consumes\u2014Wiggen\u2019s entire life. Stylistically, Howard\u2019s near stream-of-consciousness writing falls somewhere between Jack Kerouac\u2019s On the Road and Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Everything Is Illuminated, and it lends Wiggen a heartfelt, folksy charm that dovetails perfectly with his strikingly big-hearted brotherly love for Bruce. VERDICT This is a moving, genuine, and laugh-out-loud funny story that is an absolute original American gem.

The narrator of Bang the Drum is Henry Wiggen, ace pitcher for the fictitious New York Mammoths, circa 1955. Wiggen's teammates affectionately refer to him as \"Author\" because he's written a baseball book. Author chronicles a full year on the circuit, describing games\u2014the wins, the losses, the heroics and the setbacks. He keeps track of Sid's homerun count as Sid endeavors to break Ruth's record for homeruns in a season. And he tracks Washington as the team they cannot shake. Even though the Mammoths should've left them in the dust before the All Star break, Washington hangs on, always trailing by between a game and a half and four games as the season dwindles down. It's true, baseball is made for statistics, but a scene near the middle of Bang the Drum, between several teammates in the locker room, takes it to new heights: \"Today is the first time I ever officially hung this jock on this particular nail at 4:02 p.m. in the afternoon of July 9, 1955,\" said Perry.But all of that is mere backdrop to the real story: Bruce Pearson, Wiggen's pal and second string catcher, at the onset of the season is diagnosed with a terminal disease. At first Wiggen keeps it a secret, fearing that if the manager knew, Pearson would be dropped from the roster. But secrets are hard to keep, and he lets it slip to one teammate; before long everyone knows. Bang the Drum is remarkable on many levels. First, Harris captures brilliantly, through his unassuming narrative, the camaraderie of a big league club\u2014as well as the animosity. His ear for baseball vernacular is impeccable. The story at times is hilarious\u2014on a par with Bull Durham\u2014but also both bittersweet and heart wrenching. Perhaps best of all, because it is a study of human nature, one need not be a baseball aficionado to enjoy it. Bang the Drum Slowly is a masterpiece of fiction and comes with my highest recommendation."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/953335-chris", "userReview": "The baseball season is just underway. What better time than now to pick up Bang the Drum Slowly? Harris' ball players are just the types you would expect to encounter in a clubhouse. They banter with each other, torment one another, womanizer, gamble and sometimes care about winning. Though because this story takes place in the mid-fifties there is a major difference between the characters and ball players we know today. I'm pretty sure Andy Pettitte never had to sell life insurance to Jorge Posada to augment his baseball salary. While the games are chronicled and the chase for the pennant is on, baseball is not at the heart of the story. Henry Wiggen, a left-handed pitcher documents a season at the outset of which he learns that his teammate, a third string catcher named Bruce Pearson has Hodgkin's disease. Henry, better known by his teammates as 'Author' because he had published a book, tries to protect Bruce, both by making him a better player, and by attempting to let the truth of Pearson's condition stay hidden. Some have attacked the first person narrative of Wiggen, saying that the narcissism of the ball player detracts from the true tragedy of Pearson and keeps the spotlight on Henry. I disagree with this conclusion. The self-involved nature of Wiggen gives us a true perspective on the type of environment that all characters in the book live. To say that an athlete can step out of the sphere of self-praise and truly be an altruistic character is foolish and an attempt to do so would have ruined the book. They're athletes. They're self involved. There was only one thing about the book I didn't like, and it had nothing to do with the story. It was the prose. I know, you're rolling your eyes again because you've heard me say it a million times before. This book is praised because of the vernacular used by he characters. And I agree. They talk like guys you would expect to meet in a clubhouse. Almost. I noticed straightaway that Harris didn't use contractions in the conversations. 'Would not' instead of 'wouldn't'. It happened over and over again. You would (or at least I would) expect poorly educated ball players who use slang terms and vernacular style language to use more contractions. It felt awkward to hear them say 'do not'. But then later on I noticed that some characters started using the contraction, only to stop again. I couldn't find a pattern or a seeming reason as to why and where the apostrophes were used, and it bugged me. Not enough to ruin the novel, but it bugged me.My favorite line from this work: Suppose you were in a barrel of shit up to your neck and a fellow started throwing baseballs at you. What would you do? Would you duck?I'm going to have to use hat one..."}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick", "userReview": "Baseball novels don\u2019t generally work, not even for this baseball fan. I thought The Natural was dreadful, for example. Nor have I read any of Harris\u2019s other baseball novels, though I might now at least try Southpaw. Bang the Drum Slowly is a satisfying novel about friendship, written in the first person voice of Henry Wiggin, ace pitcher of the New York Mammoths. Wiggin is a smart baseball player and sharp-eyed observer of human nature. He gets along with most of his teammates and one, Bruce Pearson, a third-string catcher from Georgia, considers him a friend. During the off-season Pearson is diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s Disease and it is Wiggin he calls from the Mayo Clinic to take him home to Georgia. The novel tells the story of Pearson\u2019s final season with the Mammoth and how Wiggin\u2019s does what he can to protect him and ensure that he plays the game he loves until the last possible moment. The description of 1950s baseball is ripe with tobacco juice, hotel card games, practical jokes, and country hardball with pitchers pitching deep into extra innings, starters relieving, and doubleheaders frequently scheduled. The pennant race and game descriptions, however authentic, are unimportant backdrops to the friendship and strategies used to keep Pearson\u2019s illness secret as long as possible, adding both humor and pathos to the narrative. The plot holds no surprises beyond resolving whether Wiggin will successfully forestall a high-priced prostitute\u2019s attempt to be named Pearson\u2019s insurance beneficiary. Still the tale unfolds briskly and keeps your attention. What matters is the friendship and the at-core humanity of most of those involved with Pearson, including those who mostly ragged on the not-bright or always likable fringe player. Bang the Drum Slowly is a quick read but it has both style and substance and avoids sentimentality very well. It tells a simple story directly, grounded in the details of its characters, and is a small triumph of a yarn."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209094-pam", "userReview": "I just couldn't get with it. The grammar was something but I don't know what. This was a team in the 1950s so I'm not sure why the narrator spoke the way he did. I must have missed something. I just don't know what the point of the whole story was. The one teammate is dying but we don't even get emotionally involved in that because of the way it is told. I guess I could see that the men were friends as well as teammates but even that was not very interesting.There were a couple of things that did stand out for me...One was humorous when some of the guys who use to be friends were not getting along and no one was speaking to anyone else, the narrator says \"The whole club gives me the creeps. I am libel to wake up some morning not speaking to myself.\" That was funny!The other thing I marked was on page 184 when he gives a description of what a catcher's job is and what he must do to help his pitcher....\"His catcher must help him, must also be brain and memory and bluff, not only just stop the ball in case the hitter don't. A man's catcher must be eyes and ears, watching runners, watching wind, watching the lay of the land behind the box, watching the board, watching signs, picking up everything the pitcher might miss.\" Great description that really shows how important the catcher is to the game, to the team, to the pitcher. The book is actually worth reading for this paragraph if nothing else."}, {"userName": "Brayden", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126539-brayden", "userReview": "I was disappointed by this book. It's on several lists of the best baseball books ever written, but that praise just makes me doubt the quality of the baseball book genre. My biggest issue with the book is that the characters, including the Henry Wiggen - the narrator and main character - seem hollow and cardboard-like. The parts of the book that were meant to have an emotional impact didn't resonate with me at all. I think part of the problem may be that Harris chose to narrate the book from the point of view of a character who doesn't have a great deal of self-awareness or reflexivity. He's as clueless about his own behavior and emotions (if he has any) as we are. I appreciate the authenticity of the voice, but at times I felt like I was reading from a box score rather than reading a story about characters.If you're going to read baseball fiction, I recommend The Natural or The Art of Fielding."}, {"userName": "Lance", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8511956-lance", "userReview": "I liked this book for two reasons. One is that the dialogue and camaraderie between the ball players was realistic right down to their nicknames given to them by teammates such as \"Author\" and \"Canada\" The baseball season is realistic as well and of course New York comes out on top.The friendship between Henry and Bruce is what really makes this story a classic. It doesn't really start off that way since Henry sold insurance to Bruce (back when ballplayers needed a job in the offseason for the extra income) and then finds out afterward about Bruce's condition. The journey Henry takes while his friend is dying is humorous, poignant and sad, yet surprisingly upbeat through most of it.

My father knew Harris, and I assume from a quick check of Harris\u2019s Wikipedia page that it was when they were both on the faculty at San Francisco State in the early 1960s. I even think the two of them played softball together, something my father did often and that I assume the baseball-inclined Harris did as well.I thought this book was, more or less, Brian\u2019s Song for baseball. It\u2019s no spoiler to say that our narrator\u2019s roommate and possible best friend, Bruce Pearson, is dying. We learn it in the opening pages of the book if not from the back-cover copy. It\u2019s an old story, A.E. Housman\u2019s athlete dying young.Brian\u2019s Song was that necessary TV movie of my childhood, the one artistic statement (with the possible exception of a half-generation earlier\u2019s Old Yeller) where boys were permitted, even encouraged to cry. It too was about a pair of friends, one of them dying.This, it turns out, is much subtler, and, as a result, much more interesting.Our narrator, Henry Wiggen, is a top left-handed pitcher in the majors. As a young man, he wrote a best-selling memoir \u2013 Harris\u2019s earlier novel, \u201cThe Southpaw,\u201d \u2013 which has earned him the nickname of Author. Bruce, who\u2019s not especially bright (I\u2019d love to see how Robert DeNiro played him in the 1973 film), insists instead on calling him Arthur.Henry is at first the only one who knows about Bruce\u2019s condition, and he agrees to hide it. At first, it\u2019s a mercenary kindness. While Henry is a star, Bruce is a journeyman catcher. If word gets out that he\u2019s sick, he\u2019ll get cut and lose his livelihood. So Bruce covers for him, eventually negotiating a hardball contract that prohibits management from splitting the two roommates up. If one gets traded or released, the other has to as well.Over time, though, it becomes clear that part of Henry\u2019s motivation in hiding the truth is that he cannot really understand what it means to die. Bruce is starting to understand it, but Bruce has limited capacity to articulate much about experience.For a long time, then, Henry denies the fact of death. He can do that, first, because he\u2019s young, and second, because he\u2019s a baseball player. Every day is a new start. There\u2019s no such thing as history that extends before the first inning. It\u2019s a game of spring \u2013 when the novel opens but, in many ways, always \u2013 and it\u2019s a game of perpetual revival.And that\u2019s the ultimate beauty and power of this book. Henry is bright, funny, and unrestrained. He spends as much time not talking about Bruce\u2019s situation as talking about it. In a brilliant device, Harris introduces a writer character late in the book who reads the first couple chapters that Henry has already written of this book. And that\u2019s his criticism: the book is not enough about Bruce, but rather about Henry and all the things he does in order not quite to face up to the fact of Bruce\u2019s disease.There are splashes of Bull Durham in this. The team is in a pennant race, but more importantly it\u2019s a group of guys who know the game too well to forget it\u2019s a game. They scam one another as well as star-struck fans. They deal with racism, inflicting it and enduring it, and they try to unify against a still all-powerful management.As the season passes, word of Bruce\u2019s condition leaks out. Within the team, it brings forth a spirit of quiet generosity. One of the biggest jerks on the team goes out of his way to keep the secret and be kind to Bruce, but it\u2019s a kindness born of strength rather than tenderness. It\u2019s moving and beautiful, but it\u2019s quiet and blunt too.As Henry figures out what\u2019s going on, he both spends more time writing the book he feels called to write \u2013 with the writing of it part of the story as well \u2013 and with Bruce. He\u2019s too unlearned to understand how every generation before his has dealt with death, but he\u2019s too bright to imagine he\u2019s the first one to experience the loss of someone he cares about.The bottom line for all of that is that this book is funny. It\u2019s not knee-slappingly so \u2013 and the transformation of the sport over the last quarter century likely makes it harder for people younger than mid-30s to understand some of the particulars of what he\u2019s saying \u2013 but instead it\u2019s gently so. Henry has a funny perspective on the world. Harris\u2019s great ambition here is to compel that perspective to wrestle with death.There\u2019s no saving Bruce. We know that from the first chapter. But there is the chance to give him one more season, to draw things out and bang the drum slowly.This may no longer be for everyone because the vernacular and references have aged, but I think it really is an exceptional novel. I\u2019ve waited a long time to read this, and I may have come upon it at just the right moment."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1814541-dave", "userReview": "The second of a 4 part series, written by the late Mark Harris.

In my mind it is close to a perfect baseball book. Bang the Drum Slowly has two familiar themes. One is the story of the way a doomed man may spend his last best year on earth. The other is the story of how a quarrelsome group of raucous individualists is welded into an effective team.It has one of the loveliest last lines in American literature, a regret from Wiggen for the way the players made fun of a slow-witted and now-dead teammate: \u2018From here on in, I rag nobody.\u2019\u201d"}, {"userName": "Mac Morse", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18440223-mac-morse", "userReview": "The Natural is a wonderful novel, beautifully written and conceived.

This book is full of home runs,stolen bases,great pitching and locker room antics and a lot raging of teammates. Pearson is the guy that get most of it maybe because he is not the brightest light on the Christmas tree. But baseball is a back drop this time around. As it starts when Henry receives a phone call from Bruce, he is calling from Minnesota he tell Henry that he is in the Mayo clinic and you have to come and get me out.Henry dose not want to do go because of the cost and this is the off season,but his wife Holly,who is pregnant with their first child,tells him that he most go.Henry sells insurance in the off season and thinks this is the reason Bruce is calling \"to find out if Arcturus insurance covers time in the hospital. Of course the real reason is that Bruce has Hodgkin's disease with about six months to maybe a year to live, Bruce dose not want anyone to know about this ,not his parents ,not the team__no one must know! Wiggins writes of the season and the teams run for the pennant,describing games,wins and losses ,keeps track of Sid Goldmen's home run count,tracks Washington a the team they can not shack off. But as more of the players learn of Pearson's fatal illness and watch him start to play better and smarter with each passing week,they stop with all the raging and come closer together as a team. The last paragraph of the book is worth remembering. He was not a bad fellow,no worse than most and probably better than some, and not a bad ball player neither when they give him a chance,when they laid off him long enough._______from here on in I rag nobody-______"}, {"userName": "lucas711", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9551033-lucas711", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/453699-gina", "userReview": "PLAY BALL! I know baseball has become, since its invention a century or so ago, a popular topic for novels, poetry, essay, plays and movies. BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY should be read by aficionados of the sport; it is not THE KEYSTONE KID ETC. excellent books for children. I've read them. BANG THE DRUM is a book of great variety and brilliance. Mark Harris creates a mythical N.Y. Mammoth team in the 50's. We live with two of the characters in particular, and the whole team eventually especially Dutch, the coach. The people and situations are real, at least in the whacky world of B-ball, the drama is palpable but the satire is what really underpins much of the story:  In a locker room scene, the players begin mocking the statistic-crazed sport. Here are a few excerpts: \"Today was the first time in my official and unofficial life I ever fouled out in the seventh inning with a count of 2-2 on me againtst a right-handed pitcher name of Fairbright.\" \"Today is the first time I ever officially hung this jock on this particular nail at 4:02 in the afternoon of July 9, 1955.\" Baseball lovers, embrace this book and also the film with Robert DeNiro, Michael Moriarity and Vincent Gardenia."}, {"userName": "Pat Padden", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15655348-pat-padden", "userReview": "I just finished reading this book for our next Classics Book Discussion. Loved it - loved the wonderful vernacular, out-the-side-of-his-mouth delivery of the narrator, southpaw pitcher Henry \"Author\" Wiggen, loved his relationship with dumb-as-dirt (or is he?) good ol' Georgia boy, catcher Bruce Pearson, loved Henry's wife Holly, and the Mammoth's savvy head coach Dutch, and the owners, Patricia and Old Man Moors (also the manufacturers of the world's worst lemon automobile) - loved the whole freakin' Mammoths line-up, for that matter. This is a wonderful sports book about a truly exciting pennant race, but it's an even more wonderful testament to friendship and tolerance and loyalty, male bonding and marriage, ethnic differences and how they affect us, and about love and hard work and hard play. It's a terrific story about life, and how it's never too late - never! - to start living it like every day might be your last, because, well. We're all dying. And here's a factoid which I discovered, and with which I must say I agree, only I'd have bumped it up a lot nearer the top of the list than #95: The last line of the novel, \"From here on in I rag nobody\", was ranked number 95 on American Book Review\u2032s \"100 Best Last Lines from Novels\" in 2008."}, {"userName": "Sharon Storm", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8033418-sharon-storm", "userReview": "This book tells a story about a baseball team, its triumphs and challenges during one season, and the friendship of two players, Henry (Author) Wiggen and Bruce Pearson. Bruce is diagnosed with a terminal disease before the season and Henry is the only one on the team who knows. The descriptions of many players on the team could have been taken from today's sports pages, even though this story is set in the 1950s. They drink, gamble, etc., and there is a reference toward the end of the book to \"special pills\" that players take to stay alert. One big difference: Henry also sells insurance to supplement his income, something no professional athlete needs to do today. The writing style is different from what I usually read because Henry speaks in a roundabout way and in a way others in that time period may have spoken. Some of the chapters were kind of hard to follow, but all aspects of the story were well-told. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt and I wish there could have been more descriptions regarding the characters and their points of view. Very interesting and moving book, though, even if you are not a baseball fan."}, {"userName": "Randal", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal", "userReview": "Henry Wiggen is the star pitcher for the New York Mammoths -- a fictional mashup of the Giants, the Yankees and the Dodgers -- in the 1950s. He is also as close to a friend as Bruce Pearson, the third-string catcher, has, on or off the team. Pearson is a man-child, a poor catcher but a good hitter, uneducated as well as dumb, deeply racist and calling from Rochester, Minnesota, where the Mayo Clinic has just diagnosed him with an advanced case of Hodgkin's disease, a fatal cancer.Harris explores friendship, masculinity, machismo, tribalism, love and death while on the surface the book doesn't do a lot more than describe the mundane events of a baseball team playing through the cycle of a single season.This book won't be for some readers ... well, no book is for every reader, but this more than most. It is told in a first-person vernacular that can be a little off-putting, but for me the story more than makes up for it.I happen to think it's a hell of a good book. The movie's not bad, either."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/296430-connie", "userReview": "I found Harris' writing style a challenge at first, but not for long. Henry Wiggen is a star professional pitcher for the Mammoths in 1956 and with \"folksy charm\" tells in first person of life with the team. Life is truly challenging - time on the road away from family; temptations to be unfaithful to his wife; frustrations with the coaching/managing staff; annoyance with individuals on the team; the pressure to perform; the challenge to make enough money. Wiggen's biggest challenge is keeping the team and coaches from learning that his slow, but easy friend, catcher Bruce Pearsey, is dying of Hodgkin's Disease. Wiggen's biggest heartbreak is watching his friend die. His joys are many - having a solid supportive marriage and child, performing well, winning games, forming deep and lasting friendships, and watching his team. As they learn of Pearsey's imminent death, they begin to show sensitivity and express care for him, find value in the important things of life, and again play as a solid, unified team."}], "description": "Henry Wiggen, hero of The Southpaw and the best-known fictional baseball player in America, is back again, throwing a baseball \u201cwith his arm and his brain and his memory and his bluff for the sake of his pocket and his family.\u201d More than a novel about baseball, Bang the Drum Slowly is about the friendship and the lives of a group of men as they each learn that a teammate is dying of cancer.\u00a0Bang the Drum Slowly was chosen as one of the top one hundred sports books of all time by Sports Illustrated and appears on numerous other lists of best baseball fiction.
