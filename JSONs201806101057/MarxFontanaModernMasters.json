During that time I read Frances Wheen's book on Marx which seemed to concentrate primarily on his boils. Here they get a brief mention but the focus is on the thought. In fact everything that has recently come to light from the boils, to the idea of Marx as a writer along the lines of Mayhew or Dickens-because this reflects the tone and material of the opening of Das Kapital, to his illegitimate child produced courtesy of his maid is summed up briefly in addition to a survey of his thought in eighty odd pages. Which rather illustrates the value of these older books to the modern author. Yes, your old college books could be the making of you as a successful writer too, you just have to wait long enough for them to be forgotten.There is a sense in this book of Marx's thought as dynamic and developing over time, and that this has been a problem. Plainly Marx was a hugely creative thinker, so much so that his creativity leapt on faster and further than his pen could write, leaving a legacy of sketches, uncompleted or simply abandoned works. This meant that arguments over his meaning and legacy had been raging for decades before various writings came to light.This is a short little essay that looks at his life, thought, and reputation, in turn. For me what stood out was the influence of Schiller and German Romanticism, so one can see Marx as the Classical Economists, plus Hegel, plus Schiller, or alternatively that Marx's humanistic engagement with the economists was powered by Romanticism - which wasn't the kind of creed to accept the impacts of Capitalism on European society without passion."}, {"userName": "Naeem", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem", "userReview": "The economy, efficiency, brevity, and richness of this book is unmatched. I read its 93 short pages in one sitting -- four hours or so. I have not ready anything so concise and so on target. Published in 1975, it is divided into three sections: \"The Life\" (19 pages); \"The Thought\" (56 pages); and, \"The Reputation\" (20 pages). There is also a short bibliography called \"How to Read Marx \"(8 pages). Mclellan places Marx in his context, surveys his major contributions, and, most important, lays out the crucial ambiguities in his thought -- all while taking definitive positions of his own. It helped that I could hardly find anything with which to disagree. For example, he worries about the technical veracity of the labor theory of value, the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, the overconsumptionist thesis, and the notion of \"crisis.\" Mclellan's implicit criticism is coupled with an exposition of Marx's overall corpus. He demonstrates Marx's ability to bring together politics, economics, sociology, history, ethics, literature, aesthetics -- all with his dialectical method. Crucially, he gives to Marx's method and his disposition an openness and a creativity that he says is sometimes missed by his more doctrinaire interpreters. Nevertheless, Mclellan also present Marx's fury, passion, and humor. Especially important to me was his demonstration of how Marx was (because he had to be) simultaneously a intellect and a journalist. This is perhaps the best introduction to Marx I have read. Beware though that while he quotes Marx often, he does not provide citations. Perhaps because this is an edited down version of a longer book."}, {"userName": "Willow L", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10579010-willow-l", "userReview": "Clear, tight, fascinating introduction to Marx. The best I have read. And I have read some terrible introductions to Marxism- see H.B. Acton's 'What Marx Really Said'. McLellan offers not only a concise entry into Marx's ideas but describes them in their ambiguity and gives a little of the history of Marxist theory and practice in the final section. A really useful book."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7138526-john", "userReview": "This 92 page book is in the Fontana Modern Masters series.Though brief, and written 40 years ago, this review of Marx is very insightful. It covers Marx's biography, Marx's analysis of history, economics and politics, the aftermath, and it mentions the post war Marxist apologists, like Adorno, Harbermas, Marcuse and Althusser, who were prominent up to the 70s.The book dispels many of the misconceptions about Marx. Marx's works were unfinished, and so were his ideas. Marx never mentioned dialectical materialism. Marx actually said \"I am not a Marxist\". Marx was ambiguous and open-minded. Marx had an appreciation of the successes, as well as the failures, of Capitalism - its ability to raise living standards and enlist technology in its service, as well as realizing how chaotic and inefficient it was, and still is.This book is not a critique of Marx, but it is not partial or prejudiced. It doesn't try to deify Marx, and McLellan is aware of the limitations of Marx's thoughts. Marx was an all-embracing thinker on a grand scale, who tried to create a unified theory of how the socio-economic and political world functioned. Marx was not always right. How could he be?Marx was not post-modern, nor was he scientific. But Marx was certainly an original, independent and superior mind. Marx came from a long line of rabbis on both sides of his family, and Marx felt very much at home giving his over-view on world events, and he enjoyed being listened to. Marx was held in awe. \"Marx said it, therefore it must be right\". Marx can be viewed almost as a pseudo-religious thinker, which is one of the criticisms of Marx that is heard, and maybe that is one of the reasons why Marxism became a substitute for religion for some, and a person reviled and hated by others. McLellan places Marx as a product of his times, and many of Marx's ideas have been superseded by history, even proved wrong. Thus Capitalism has been far more resilient than Marx thought it would be. Marx firmly believed that inherent in Capitalism were the seeds of its own destruction. Capital would be squeezed, so that profits would inevitably decline. Workers (the proletariat) would be further debased. This hasn't proved to be true.People - in the developed world, at least - have shared in the successes of Capitalism, although the bottom 10% or so have been largely forgotten, as have those in under-developed countries like Burkina Faso in Africa.Capitalism has managed to utilize new advances in technology to maintain its profits. Globalization has allowed Capitalism to chase new and cheaper labor markets. Capitalism survives, still lurching from one crisis to another, as Marx predicted.Marx's theory that the cost of labor is the prime factor that determines the market value of a product, is far too simplistic. Marx never fully appreciated the concept of consumer sovereignty. The market value of a product may be determined by how much people are willing to pay for it.Marx would perhaps be amazed that people have managed to socialize their jobs, so that the repetitious soul-destroying monotony of the assembly line are mostly a thing of the past - at least, in developed countries. But Marx would have observed that many people all over the world still toil at jobs that have no meaning for them and that create \"alienation\". (Alienation is the feeling that the product that you have created does not represent a part of you, it is not a creative part of you, and that your time spent doing the job is not the real you. It turns yourself into the other.) Marx was and still is highly influential, 132 years after his death, and whether you admire him him or you detest him, Marx needs to be read, and assimilated."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9800799-john", "userReview": "Super-concise introduction (just 93 pages) provides fluency in the titanic thought and achievements of Marx. This book really rocked my world, causing me once again to question what I've been taught in school, and the motives of those setting the curriculum. Marx is so misrepresented (demonized) in our society, and the book so dense with brilliance, that every page was a surreal experience. The wisdom contained therein has only increased in importance, as world history has followed the course Marx predicted.
