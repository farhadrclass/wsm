I grabbed the gentle creature\u2019s neck with both hands and gave it a good hard twist\u2026 Katarina was wrong: I have killed before. Out of mercy. But not yet out of vengeance.The Lost Files: Six\u2019s Legacy is a great transition back into the Lorien Legacies. It\u2019s full on packed with action and downright blood, fury and fight. Nothing short of what I expected.In this book, we get number Six\u2019s back-story and how she lost her Cepan Katarina to the Mogs. Meeting her in the first book, I knew right away she was a badass that could hold her own, and in this pre-qual we find out what she went through when she and her Cepan were captured and tortured by the Mogs, which ultimately made her indestructible and down right deadly. I love stong female fictional characters that can stand on their own and fight with all they have, and number Six is as tough as they come.If you\u2019re a fan of number Six or just want to get some history on what she went through before she started gathering the Garde to fight against the Mogs, then  The Lost Files: Six\u2019s Legacy  will tell you everything you need to know.

I started this one on the train on the way into work and had finished it before going to sleep that evening... It's a prequel, of sorts, to I Am Number Four - the book that spawned a series, a movie and a fair bit of controversy about how the team behind Pittacus Lore are recompensed for their efforts.This story is far from essential to the series, it provides an interesting background to Number Six, the second of the Lorien nine to be introduced in I Am Number Four. While a late arrival in that book, her back story isn't explored and she's quite cagey about what happened to her C\u00eapan (guardian). Here we are introduced to the her story, from their first contact with the Mogadorians, through their inevitable capture and loss of Katrina her C\u00eapan (well, we knew she was missing) and ends with her discovery in the news of the events of I Am Number Four.The story is short and tries to cover a lot of ground. Unfortunately, at the expense of detail. There is very little characterisation or depth to the writing at all. If your already a fan of the series and something of a completist, by all means you won't be overly disappointed - there seems little reason for anybody else to spend the time though."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46077764-sarah", "userReview": "I absolutely love Six, so this little background story of her was just perfect.

Infuriating. It was awesome, and kick ass, and totally worth buying for about 60 pages. But it could have been so much more!!! Six's story before she met up with John was action packed and wonderfully written. It left me wanting a lot more also. I wanted to get to know Six on a much more personal level, and while I got glimpses of her nature it wasn't enough. Btw Six is BADASS! Let me share a little with you:\"I felt more alive than I've ever felt. I open my mouth to speak. That's for Katriana, I'm about to say. But I don't. I don't speak because I know it's a lie. That wasn't for Katriana. That was for me.\"Badass?! YES! Six, as we can tell in IANF, is definitely strong, fearless, a little reckless. Lets face it though, she's awesome, you loved her. The end. Such an amazingly substantial character that I can not believe she's been put into the background in both novels so far. I guess this novella is supposed to make up that fact but I am not satisfied. My one and only complaint here is that there is not enough. I don't know if I was hoping for more of her beginning or maybe seeing her side of things on what went down in Paradise, but I was expecting something, anything really. When that last page came looming I was in shock. I'm hoping for more information on her intuition to go into the cafe because in here and in the second book, no headway is made on that...Anyway, this is a wonderful companion to I am Number Four and The Power of Six. Pick it up if you haven't read it yet!"}, {"userName": "Dagmar", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38109673-dagmar", "userReview": "ik wist al veel informatie van Zes uit deel 2 van de lorien kronieken, De kracht van Zes.

When she meets up with four at the end of that novel, there are a number of unanswered questions which are now revealed in this ebook short story, detailing her life up until that point, how her Cepan was lost, and how she came into her own legacies.I really enjoyed reading the background story on Number Six. Although her story is similar to Number Four's, the different perspective was interesting, and her experiences that led up to her Cepan's death were really essential for understanding who she is in the Lorien series. Because it's a short story, the action moves fast, but there's still enough introspection and reflection for the reader to really feel connected to Six. In some ways, though, I felt Six's story was a bit too similar to Four's -- they are constantly on the move, don't get to settle down or make friends, and when they finally do let their guard down, the Mogs are there to take advantage of their slip in vigilance, and the end result is the Cepan's death. I'd have actually been more interested in Six's life after her Cepan's death -- how did she get by without a guardian/protector? She essentially went from a twelve-year-old girl to a solitary adult without any sort of normal transition, and I'd have liked to hear more about that adjustment.This is a great bonus novella for those reading the Lorien Legacies. Keep in mind that I have only read the first book; I'm not sure how this one fits in with the subsequent books, but as a \"prequel\" to I Am Number Four, I think it works well."}, {"userName": "Selina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5173356-selina", "userReview": "It seems to be a popular trend to release short stories or novella's for a series to warm up readers for the upcoming release of a book. Some of these are nice-to-have-but-nothing-special and more for the already existing fans of the series or to give readers a nice intro to the series (for example Survivors or First Frost). Others are so great that you really don't want to miss out on them (for example The Strange Case of Finley Jayne). Six's Legacy definitely belongs in the last category. What a treat! It's a well rounded, fast paced story that perfectly complements I am Number Four and leaves you wanting for more. Six is such a cool chick and we don't get to know her very well in the first book so this was a great story to get to know her better. Six's Legacy is supposed to be a prequel to the series (book 0.5), but it was released after I am Number Four. In any case, it is fine to read as a standalone, but makes a lot of sense if you already read the first book in the series because you are more familiar with the backstory.

Awesome! I totally love her in I Am Number Four and Power of Six so I just had to read The Lost Files: Six\u2019s Legacy.This book began with Six telling her story of where she and Katarina started off when they landed on Earth escaping from Lorien.I had a lot of fun learning how Six\u2019s life went about. Then it got to the part where she and her Cepan were discovered by the Mogadorians; I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t any good but if you\u2019ve read the Power of Six before reading this, it\u2019s kind of a throw away since Six has practically told the same story there too. The story, of course, is more detailed here than in the Power of Six but purchasing this separately no matter how low the price is, and finding the same content or rather the most important parts of it in the next instalment seems a waste of money.However, I will not deny that this was a short good-enough read.

Why I liked it more than the first book, I do not know. If someone told me it was written by someone else, I would believe them. The story is of Six's early days when she had her Cepan, Katerina. It tells of Kat's death and how Six developed her Legacies and became the badass she is. I wish there would have been more to the story. It ended so quickly. I have yet to read The Power of Six, so maybe that will show more of her past life. I hope so.The book was written in Six's perspective, in other words, a female voice. Maybe this is why I related better to it? When I was in Four's head, I was bored. Men don't have very exciting thoughts. But girls see the world differently and I liked seeing what Six saw. There was detail and beauty behind her words that I never saw in the first book.

Although released well after I Am Number Four, Six\u2019s Legacy is supposed to be read as a prequel to the series. However, knowing about Six (the aim of this novella) or not knowing Six when you read I Am Number Four, is nothing to be concerned about and it doesn\u2019t matter either way. You basically learn most about Six through John (Four) in The Power of Six. Reading from Six\u2019s perspective though, gives you an enticing look into her past and survival first-hand. It makes a lot of sense if you read I Am Number Dour so that you are more familiar with the backstory that is referred to in the short.The Power of Six is an explosive and well-rounded novella that gives you an insight into what it\u2019s like to be Six and where that feisty girl we know of, came from."}, {"userName": "Aliza", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2297587-aliza", "userReview": "An interesting glance at the life of a side character from \"I am Number Four,\" the character of Six. The story really holds your attention during the cruel capture and torture of Six and her Cepan. Altogether though, she has led a similar life to Four, force to move around and change identities in order to stay alive. However, there are new details that we get from her perspective about being part of the Garde. This time we also get to see things not only from a female perspective but from a feistier one. Six has always been ready for a fight. Even more interesting is the look at the first few chapters at the follow-up to \"I am Number Four,\" which focuses on the character of Seven who has led a very different life than the other Numbers."}, {"userName": "Pickle Rick", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4678735-pickle-rick", "userReview": "wow.
