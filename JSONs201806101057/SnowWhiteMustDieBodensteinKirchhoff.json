Of the three, the strongest emotions were directed against myself for continuing to endure the pain of listening to the book to its very end.Out of respect to a fellow author, I cannot bring myself to blame him for the inane comments that kept emphasizing things that would be obvious for any reader above the age of six. Surely these had to be less mind-numbing in the original German if they appeared at all.Absolving the author for the above still leaves plenty of room for criticism. The book takes place in a village in which practically every resident is guilty of one heinous fault or another and must, therefore, be properly punished, however implausibly. By the book's end, they've all been done away with, one way or another, leaving, one supposes, nothing but a ghost town. That being the case, it will presumably be stricken from official maps and the place consigned to its well deserved oblivion."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "When I started this book I was what I'd call \"mildly interested\".

Five years ago, three years ago, maybe even eighteen months ago, I would have enjoyed this book for what it was: a perfectly serviceable cold case police procedural, albeit with a few odd elements in it (I don't know what the German statute of limitations looks like, but I'm pretty sure it's harder to waive it over here). I don't know what's gone wrong but I can make a couple of educated guesses.Guess the first: I\u2019ve read more things, so it\u2019s harder to please me. I\u2019m noticing mistakes more. I\u2019m spotting the tropes, I\u2019m rolling my eyes more at the things I don\u2019t like. For example, this book\u2019s attitude to women made me tired. A couple of years back, I instated a rule about the media I consume, which is defined thus: We do not accept hoeing as motive. Which is to say, in murder mysteries, I do not like it when women die because of who they slept with, or didn\u2019t sleep with, or flirted with, or didn\u2019t flirt with. We do not accept \u201cshe had an affair, so of course she had to die\u201d at face value. We do not accept \u201cjealousy, amirite?!\u201d as a de facto reason for killing a person. In context of SWMD, that means that you don\u2019t get to kill two teenage girls as the hook and then leave them faceless and lusted after. It\u2019s lazy, it\u2019s boring, you\u2019re contributing to the problem. This is in so many damn mysteries; I don\u2019t like it and I don\u2019t want to read about it any more.You also, incidentally, don\u2019t get to have your other hook be a middle aged woman getting shoved off a bridge in traffic, and then NEVER REFER TO HER AGAIN because it\u2019s the dead, pretty, teenage girls that\u2019s more interesting. We do not accept hoeing as motive.Guess the second, and related to guess the first: I\u2019ve turned into a literary thrill seeker and this isn\u2019t a good enough fix any more. More than likely to some extent. I found this article shortly after finishing SWMD. It\u2019s got a good point, and I don\u2019t really know what to do about that at the moment.Guess the third: I\u2019ve read more broadly, so my tastes have shifted. I used to avidly consume anything and everything I could find, and these days I\u2019ve got more discriminating and a bit more literary. This is why I care about lazy writing, because I\u2019ve discovered that I like challenging things, I like being challenged, I like it when both I and the author have had to work. And that\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t get that with this kind of novel \u2013 I defy anyone to look Maj Sjowall, Henning Mankell, Elizabeth George, Val McDermid in the eye and tell them you can\u2019t write a clever police procedural that is challenging in its presentation of the puzzle and also of the world that it comments upon. I love a good procedural, it is one of my favourite things and I will never feel ashamed of reading them \u2013 god no. But I like them for their opportunities to question, to draw social juxtapositions, to make connections between people and things and situations that otherwise wouldn\u2019t get a look in. I am sad that this book was a wasted opportunity for so many interesting things.Guess the fourth: I write more stories now, and I\u2019m also not very good at it, so I recognise the metaphorical pencil marks when I see them. Can\u2019t fool me, Nele Neuhaus. I know what a plot strand thrown out to be possibly picked up if I run out of steam later looks like. Doesn\u2019t endear me any. A well-written novel looks like the product of a magic trick, like it came out of the ground whole, not like it was put together piece by piece with no idea of what the end product would look like. At any rate, a few parts just felt a bit slapdash.Guess the fifth: I\u2019ve lost the ability to switch off the contextualising and just focus on what\u2019s on the page in front of me, rather than what I wish it could be. I hope, hope, hope it\u2019s not this but I fear it might be.At any rate, I was disappointed, which was a shame, because this was bought for me by my mum and I had high hopes for it. Which leaves me with a weird conclusion: since I started this as comfort reading, and comfort reading isn\u2019t working for me at the moment \u2013 if I start thrill-seeking in earnest, am I going to end up burning myself out and not looking at a book for six weeks? I guess there\u2019s one way to find out."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael", "userReview": "Ever since Stieg Larson's Millenium trilogy hit it big, it seems like the mystery shelves have been flooded with a ton of imported mysteries and thrillers, all attempting to capture lighting in a bottle for a second time.Of the translated thrillers I've read over the past couple of years, it's Snow White Must Die that not only captured me and wouldn't let go but also left me hoping that the rest of this series will get translated and published in America ASAP. Simply put, Snow White is one of the most entertaining and enthralling mystery novels I've read in a long time.Over a decade ago, two girls with a romantic connection to Tobias Satorius went missing. Suspicion centered on Tobias, who experience a 24-hour blackout around the time of the disappearances, leading to Tobias' conviction and ten year jail sentence. As he's released from prison, Tobias returns home to find his parents estranged, his father's business in ruin and the town unwilling to forget the crimes of which he was convicted. When Tobias' mother is assaulted on an overpass and put in the hospital and another young girl disappears, the town is only too ready to convict Tobias again in the court of public opinion. Enter police detectives Pia Kirchhoff and Oliver von Bodenstein who are summoned to the scene of the attack on Tobias' mother and slowly begin digging into the details of the current crime and trying to unearth whether or not Tobias was actually guilty of the crimes a decade or more before.While Snow White Must Die is clearly trying to hitch its wagon to the Girl With the... phenomenon, the novel reminded me more of the best works of Elizabeth George and Laura Lippman (who I feel are two of the best writers publishing today, mystery or otherwise). The team of Kirchhoff and Bodenstein reminded me a bit of the early days of Lynley and Havers in all the right ways. As the fourth book in the series featuring them and the rest of their team of detectives, I found myself yearning to spend more time getting to know these characters and see where their stories led next. As for the mystery, it works fairly well for much of the novel, though I was able to discern some of the twists from the later half of the book before our detective heroes do. But that's because the reader is clued into certain pieces of information and character moments before the detectives are. The only other drawback is several of the names in the novel are similar, creating some bit of confusion as to who is who in the early going, but this confusion is quickly left behind if you're willing to invest a little time and attention to the novel.And that won't be a difficult thing to do. Snow White Must Die is a rewarding and compelling mystery thriller that had me eager to turn the next page and saying to myself, \"Just one more chapter\" at the close of each chapter. A solid mystery with some interesting detectives all adds up to a satisfying first American entry into this series. And one I hope that to visit again sooner rather than later."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael", "userReview": "Skin as white as snow, hair as black as ebony and lips as red as blood\u2026 Snow White Must Die is far from a fairy Tale. In a small German town, after serving 10 years for the murder of two 17 year old girls, Tobias Sartorius is released. The town is not happy with his return and when another pretty girl goes missing the suspicion obviously is put on him. As the police race to find the missing girl they start to discover things are not as black and white and maybe Tobias isn\u2019t the killer they all thought he was.Snow White Must Die is my first German crime novel and I was very impressed with the way this book played out. You start off with a suspicion and slowly through the complex twists you discover that this is just a huge web of lies. The book starts off with Tobias return and the whole town angry toward him, it reminded me a little of We Need to Talk about Kevin with the author exploring the psychology of trying to live in a town where everyone hates you.Then you discover all the evidence that convicted Tobias was circumstantial and that\u2019s when the questions start. I spent a lot of time trying to understand the motivations of each of the characters, always suspecting they are hiding something. Nele Neuhaus plays with the reader really well, always hinting but never showing her hand too early. The complexity of this case grows but Neuhaus beautifully handles it all without going overboard.I love the way Nele Neuhaus starts off the story with Tobias as the lead and then when things start getting more centred around the crime it shifts focus toward the detectives working the case. I think this was masterfully done and left it open to kill off lead characters if she wished without throwing the story out. As the corruption and the conspiracy within this town begins to be uncovered, no one is safe and this leaves the reader with an anxiety when they put the book down.I don\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve read a police procedural that I\u2019ve enjoyed this much, I\u2019ve noticed this is book four in a series but it reads like a standalone book. I really hope they translate more of Nele Neuhaus novels because I\u2019m really impressed with her style and would love the chance to enjoy more of her books.Snow White Must Die is a well crafted thriller that while brutal and violent, it still remains accessible. I would have liked this book to be a little darker but it was still a brilliant book of lies, greed and corruption. I would love to read some more German novels, crime ones in particular if anyone has some good recommendations. Nele Neuhaus showed real skill when she wrote Snow White Must Die and it was a real pleasure to experience it. I wish I could read German to enjoy this book in its original text.This review originally appeared on my blog; http://literary-exploration.com/2013/..."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47427273-lou", "userReview": "Hace tiempo que me recomendaron este libro y al terminarlo me ha dejado con muy buen sabor de boca.

In welcher Reihe heiratet der Sohn schon der \u00e4lteste Sohn das M\u00e4dchen, das dem Ermittler-Vater schon in Teil eins gefallen hat, weil ja schon die Mama die gro\u00dfe Jugendliebe gewesen ist? Und in welcher Reihe lebt die Ermittlerin mit dem sympathischen Zoodirektor und Ersatzvater von einem der Jungkriminellen aus Teil zwei in harmonischer Partnerschaft zusammen? Und dann findet auch noch der, seit den Anf\u00e4ngen der unbeliebten Frau bestehende, Abw\u00e4rtstrend von Cary-Grant-L\u00e4chler Bodensteins Ehe seinen vorl\u00e4ufigen Endpunkt. Zwei fiese oder faule Kollegen fallen unangenehm auf, bzw. greifen in die Ermittlungen ein und k\u00f6nnen endlich gem\u00fcllt werden, ja die K11-Soap schreitet munter voran und wer wissen will, ob Bodenstein einer der pers\u00f6nlichen Gewinner des m\u00f6rderischen Spektakels von Altenhain ist und selbst in verwandtschaftliche Beziehungen mit dem Paten ger\u00e4t, der muss auch Band f\u00fcnf lesen, in dessen Verlauf wohl auch die zwischenzeitlich gar von Obdachlosigkeit bedrohte Pia Kirchhoff in ihr neues Heim einzieht. Damit das auch richtig standesgem\u00e4\u00df und noch tierlieber ausf\u00e4llt, hat ihr geliebter Zoodirektor eine fette Entsch\u00e4digung f\u00fcr das Land unter dem illegal errichteten Hof heraus geschlagen. Ein doppeltes Happy End, das trotzdem Lust auf mehr macht. Geschickt eingef\u00e4delt, Nele Neuhaus, zumal die zahlreichen Frauen, die auf Partnerschaftsportalen allesamt zuerst einen gepflegten und dann erst einen gut aussehenden, eleganten oder sportlichen Mann und am besten alles zusammen, beim Krimi Lesen doch nicht alle ganz andere Neigungen entwickeln d\u00fcrften. Oder gibt es da doch einen ganz privaten weiblichen Dreckspatz-Fetisch, der bei der Lekt\u00fcre von Krimis mit ungewaschenen, dauerverkaterten Ermittlern ausgelebt werden muss, die geradezu magisch ihre Wegwerfgeliebten anziehen? F\u00fcr alle Leserinnen, die nicht darunter leiden, bietet Nele Neuhaus die ideale Krimikost.Der immer weiter fortlaufende Strang um das K11 sorgt sicherlich f\u00fcr einen gewissen Serien-Sog und auch sonst entt\u00e4uscht der pl\u00f6tzlich wieder ganz hei\u00df gewordene Cold Case nicht die Erwartungen der Fan-Gemeinde. Auf die geschlossenen Gesellschaften eines exklusiven Reiterclubs, in dem die Rosst\u00e4uscher den Ton angeben und einem Zirkel von \u00d6kofaschisten mit einem Rudel rebellischer S\u00f6hne von eifrig miteinander kungelnden Ortsgewaltigen folgt in Schneewittchen muss sterben die geschlossene Dorfgemeinschaft von Altenhain, ein Dorf im Vordertaunus, in das der in einem reinen Indizienprozess wegen des Doppelmords verurteilte Tobi Sartorius zur\u00fcck kehrt. Au\u00dfer einer kleinen Gesichtsverletzung, die ihn noch interessanter macht, hat der Einserabiturient, der w\u00e4hrend der Haftzeit BWL studiert und zudem noch eine Schlosserlehre absolviert hat, aber keine weiteren Sch\u00e4den davon getragen. Nat\u00fcrlich war Tobi auch noch eine Sportskanone und wird von einer ber\u00fchmten Schauspielerin und fr\u00fcheren Jugendfreundin abgeholt, f\u00fcr die er nach wie vor die Liebe ihres Lebens ist, auch wenn seine Liebestechnik immerhin stark verbesserungsw\u00fcrdig ist. Wieder zur\u00fcck im vollkommen verdreckten v\u00e4terlichen Hof erweist sich der junge Mann auch noch gleich als Putz- und Aufraumgenie und zieht die ebenfalls Sympathin gezeichnete Amelie an, auf die auch der auf diese Altersgruppe spezialisierte Ortsgewaltige Claudius Terlinden ein Auge geworden hat. Zu allem \u00dcberfluss ist die ausgewilderte Gro\u00dfstadtpflanze nicht auch noch Siebzehn, sondern sieht auch noch wie das Schneewittchen aus, f\u00fcr dessen Tod Sartorius ja 11 Jahre seines Lebens verloren hat.Ein verwunschener M\u00e4rchenprinz, den der weibliche Teil der Leserschaft sicher ebenso schnell ins Herz schlie\u00dfen wird wie Oliver von Bodenstein, den frau schon seit dem ersten Teil wegen der Ehe mit dauerweltreisenden Fernsehtante Cosima bemitleiden darf. So viel m\u00e4nnliche Attraktivit\u00e4t gab es in den mir bekannten Vorg\u00e4ngerb\u00fcchern nicht, der M\u00e4rchenbezug und die Doppelg\u00e4ngerinnenthematik m\u00f6gen ebenfalls dazu beigetragen haben, dass der vierte Teil der Reihe einen enormen Schub bescherte.Der Rest ist Nele Neuhaus Business as usual, innerhalb der jeweiligen geschlossenen Gesellschaft gibt es zahlreiche Abh\u00e4ngigkeitsverh\u00e4ltnisse und nicht wenige offene Rechnungen aus den Jahren und Jahrzehnten zuvor. \u00dcberm\u00e4chtige V\u00e4ter und ungl\u00fcckliche S\u00f6hne spielen mal wieder eine Rolle, ebenso der Faktor Neid im Fall von Tobi und seinen nicht ganz so brillanten Altersgenossen. Wieder einmal rollen Kirchhoff und Bodenstein eine lokale Seilschaft auf und wieder einmal gibt es f\u00fcr aufmerksame Leser viel Leerlauf, weil Frau Neuhaus nicht so recht unter Kontrolle hat, wie viel ein Autor beim mehrstr\u00e4ngigen Erz\u00e4hlen an Indizien preis geben kann, ohne die Ermittler als mal wieder emotional verstrickte Volldeppen dastehen zu lassen. Immerhin gibt sie Bodenstein, der im Verlauf der Ermittlungen seine Cosima beim Arbeitsessen mit ihrem Liebhaber ertappt, so etwas wie ein Alibi f\u00fcr seine Abgelenktheit. Ansonsten ist mir zu viel einfach dahin gewurschtelt, bzw. der \u00fcbliche Eintopf klassischer oder politisch korrekter Krimi-Elemente. Die M\u00f6rder sind nat\u00fcrlich allesamt Luschen, die nicht viel mehr auf die Reihe bringen als junge M\u00e4dchen im Rudel zu vergewaltigen oder humorlose Trottel, die von ihren \u00fcberm\u00e4chtigen Frauen auf Ministersessel geschoben zu werden. Im gek\u00fcrzten H\u00f6rbuch beim Autofahren hat mich ihre Wurschtelei nicht so sehr gest\u00f6rt wie beim Lesen, im Moment bin ich her in der Stimmung, wenn schon dann als H\u00f6rbuch, aufgrund des Soap-Faktors werde ich mir wohl doch noch den dritten Teil mit dem f\u00fcr eine Liebesnacht unter Drogen gesetzten Bodenstein sogar in der gedruckten Version antun, aber Teil f\u00fcnf B\u00f6ser Wolf kommt mir allenfalls zu Geh\u00f6r."}, {"userName": "F.R.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1309606-f-r", "userReview": "When a German novel has been translated into lumpy and plodding English, who does one blame? Is it the author or the translator? After all, if the book was originally written in lumpy and plodding German, surely it behoves the translator to them render it in similar quality English? That would be the best representation of the book, after all. But what if the translator isn\u2019t that good? What if, no matter how scintillating, poetic or beautiful the original German, this particular translator can only render it into the lumpiest and most plodding English? What if lumpy and plodding English is the absolute height of this translator\u2019s skills? Obviously I\u2019m opening the gates on a whole philosophical minefield here, one where I don\u2019t have any answers and, if I\u2019m honest, do not want to spend hours engaging with. So okay, if I can\u2019t really judge it on the quality of the prose, I\u2019ll have to look at how well it works as a thriller. Sadly there, more in my field of expertise, I found it wanting. This is a book which relies on a truly massive coincidence, with a few smaller coincidences thrown in for good measure, and has a town where every single character (even those who don\u2019t have lines, so are just names with vague shapes) keep terrible secrets. Fine, there are a lot of actually good thrillers with flaws on that scale, but this one has none of the sleight of hand needed to slip those improbabilities past the reader. What we end up with is an undoubtedly ambitious book, but one which can\u2019t keep a firm grasp on itself and so leaves the reader staring goggle-eyed and incredulous.A young man is released from prison after serving a sentence for double murder. His arrival home is the catalyst for other crimes and slowly the seams of the original investigation to fall apart. I\u2019ll be fair and say that at points it\u2019s gripping, but there also points where it\u2019s tedious soap opera. In the end this is a bog standard thriller and in of itself there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Most readers have moments where they reach for a bog standard thriller.

Convicted solely on circumstantial evidence, when the body of one of the young girls is unearthed just days after Tobias's release, Pia begins to question the findings of the original investigation. As she probes the holes in the case, another teenage girl, last seen in the company of Tobias, goes missing and the townspeople is certain Tobias is to blame.For Tobias the return to the community in which he grew up is difficult. He is devastated to discover his parents have divorced, his father's life is in ruins and he quickly becomes targeted by vigilantes within the village. Only Nadia, his childhood best friend, and Amelie, a young stranger in the town, are welcoming. In defiance of the towns vitriol Tobias refuses to leave, determined to first help his father regain his footing and perhaps uncover the truth about the murders of which he was accused. But when Amelie goes missing he is once again the focus of the police investigation and the target of the townspeople.Despite being told to leave the case alone, Pia is bothered by it's inconsistencies, especially when Tobias's mother is thrown from an overpass.

The multiple twists and turns of the plot are intriguing as the author connects the past and the present. I did think the pacing was a little uneven. After a slow start it begins to pick up but midway the plot loses momentum, adding detail here and there to the story and characters, but not really moving towards a resolution. Yet as the threads finally do begin to unravel, I couldn't put it down.The translation, by Steven T Murray, is a little awkward at times but not unduly so. I have to admit that I was thrown on occasion by the unfamiliarity of German names, especially with such a large cast to keep track of. Snow White Must Die is an elaborate, engrossing crime novel where greed, betrayal, fear and the instinct for self preservation all collide to create a multi-layered story. I really enjoyed it and I hope that Neuhaus's previous novels in the series find their way into the English speaking market soon."}, {"userName": "Alexandra ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2982535-alexandra", "userReview": "Schnewittchen ist ein sehr guter Krimi, den ich bedauerlicherweise mit 2 Sternen Abzug abstrafen muss.Gekonnt beschreibt die Autorin zu Beginn des Romans diese agressive Dorfatmosph\u00e4re, die dem selbstverst\u00e4ndlich unschuldig verurteilten und entlassenen M\u00f6rder, der seine Strafe abgesessen hat, und seiner Familie entgegenschl\u00e4gt. Leider beginnt bereits ab S. 99 das schw\u00fclstige Liebes- bzw. Sexgepl\u00e4nkel und die Hinaufstilisierung des unschuldigen M\u00f6rders zum Traummann. Was haben die meisten (nicht alle) Krimiautorinnen immer mit dieser Genre Mischung aus Liebesroman und Thriller? Ein Goodreads Freund nannte es \"Bauknecht wei\u00df, was Frauen w\u00fcnschen\" und hat damit ironisch voll ins Schwarze getroffen, denn welche moderne Frau hat heutzutage noch eine altmodische Bauknechtk\u00fcche. Ich nenne es ja eher das M\u00e4rchenprinzsyndrom, dem viele Autorinnen unterliegen, und das sie auch ihrer weiblichen Klientel diagnostizieren mit den einhergehenden krankhaften Symptomen, L\u00fcsternheit, sexuelle Ausschweifungen, dumm naive Romantik, Gummiknie, und Abschaltung des logischen Denkens.... So ein Bl\u00f6dsinn w\u00fcrde einem m\u00e4nnlichen Krimiautor nie einfallen, da sind die m\u00e4nnlichen Identifikationsfiguren entweder versoffene kranke ausgebrannte Arschl\u00f6cher (Harry Hole, Wallander, Van Veteren...) oder mehlwurmartige Weicheier vom Dienst wie der Brenner und der Metzger. Auf jeden Fall sind sie als M\u00e4nnerpers\u00f6nlichkeiten weitaus realistischer als diese romantischen Mannskonstrukte ala M\u00e4rchenprinz, die mit der rosaroten Brille gezeichnet wurden. So jetzt habe ich genug kritisiert und abgestraft und komme zu den St\u00e4rken des Romans.Das Geflecht von Verbrechen, Beihilfe und Vertuschung in der eng verwobenen Dorfgemeinde macht den Krimiplot zu einem wirklich spannenden M\u00f6rderraten. Ein paar Aspekte h\u00e4tte ich als Kommissarin zwar aufgedeckt, aber nie mit derart komplexen Amigo-Strukturen gerechnet. Sehr innovativ, spannend und nicht an den Haaren herbeigezogen! Das B\u00f6se entpuppt sich vor allem in spie\u00dfigen langweiligen D\u00f6rfern, in denen jeder jedem einen Gefallen schuldet, nach und nach, w\u00e4chst sich zu atemberaubender Schlechtigkeit aus und endet in einem furiosen Finale aus Schuld. Die Figuren der Autorin sind sehr tief und liebevoll gezeichnet, zusmeist eine St\u00e4rke von weiblichen Autorinnen, eben fast zu tief, denn ich will wirklich nicht jedes Sexabenteuer im Detail und jede schmalzig romantische Anwandlung (man k\u00f6nnte es auch Gedanken nennen, wenn das Hirn eine Rolle spielen w\u00fcrde) wissen.Fazit: Wenn man die Sexszenen nur andeuten, das unrealistische M\u00e4nnerbild und das schmalzige Ges\u00fclze herausstreichen w\u00fcrde - also alle nicht krimirelevanten Komponenten des Romans beseitigen w\u00fcrde - dann w\u00e4re dies f\u00fcr mich ein Krimi, der sich 5 Sterne verdient h\u00e4tte."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2281353-patty", "userReview": "Snow White Must DiebyNele Neuhaus My \"in a nutshell\" summary...A ten year old crime comes to the surface again when the convicted man...Tobias... is released from prison and returns to his home.My thoughts after reading this book...OMG...what a fast paced thrill ride this book was.

Unaware of tragedies she will unearth, she is called out to view the bones of an unknown individual discovered in an old underground jet fuel tank on a former military airfield at Eschborn, Germany. Her partner and boss, Bodenstein, hasn't been himself lately, and Pia finds herself taking the lead on the case as secrets begin to unravel.Another body, seemingly unrelated to the discovery at the airfield, brings both detectives to the scene of a 7-car collision in Sulzbach, caused by the attempted murder of a woman pushed off of a bridge into traffic. She barely survives with multiple injuries. Tracing her movements back to her car, they learn her name is Rita Cramer. From her apartment and her answering machine, phone numbers lead to Cramer's doctor, her ex-husband, and the small town of Altenhain.Everybody knows everybody in Altenhain. Families have lived there for generations. Almost everybody works on some level for the same man, Claudius Terlinden, owner of half of the town. The town feels fortunate that Terlinden takes care of them all. Especially since Tobias Sartorius has returned on release from prison to his father's Altenhain house. Tobias has finished serving a ten-year term for the murder of two beautiful local girls whose bodies were never found. Despite there being only circumstantial evidence, most people are satisfied that Tobias is the killer, and they are not happy that he has come back. The town decides he will not be permitted forgiveness, although Claudius is oddly supportive of the murderer. Tobias himself, unable to remember what happened that terrible night when the girls disappeared, does not want to be there, but he finds his father has divorced his mother and he has lost his restaurant business because of the disappearances. Tobias begins to restore his father's rundown house to some livability. Several things happen in quick succession: Kirchhoff and Bodenstein inform Tobias that the woman in the hospital who someone had tried to kill is his mother. The skeleton found at the airfield was one of the murdered girls. There is no way he could have driven her there. Acts of vandalism begin to happen to his father's dilapidated home, which soon escalate into more dangerous threats. Four old friends seem to accept him without reservations, but weirdest of all, he has met a newcomer to the town, a waitress, Amelie, who looks exactly like one of the missing girls, with Snow White coloration and beauty....I found 'Snow White Must Die' a little stilted, perhaps because of the translation, but I quickly became accustomed to the occasional awkwardness. It is a police procedural, European style. The fact that this is written by a German author was a cause for great curiosity on my part. I've never read a book written by a German writer that wasn't on a 'Great Books' list, as in the classics author, Thomas Mann. So I was eager to read this on that point alone!Hooray! It was good! Complex, full of twists and turns, a town full of possible suspects and so many motives the reader might need to diagram the possibilities out, it is an interesting read. Alliances and (im)moral influences have been amplified by the usual small town anxieties and unexamined gossip.I think it was very European in that it included a lot of details on the officers' personal family life that one almost never sees in American police procedurals. Here in the USA, fictional cops are usually extremely damaged and depressed, unable to hang onto any relationships for long without causing their loved ones maximum destruction. In European mysteries, cops are supported more by community and friends. There is more formality, but it is an easy going kind of formality. Individualism isn't as pronounced or emphasized as in American detective mysteries. 'Snow White Must Die' is not a cozy, though. There is rape and nightmarish murders, as well as a town full of individuals who are operating more as a lynch mob protecting personal interests rather than honest citizens seeking justice. This is not a book which the reader should set down too long before picking up again, though. The 'red herrings' and variety of characters are numerous and tangled, ensuring confusion if left too long unread. I don't think it is helpful that it is book four in a series, either. Backstory information on the police is compressed and quickly told, although I wasn't lost by the swift review. It works as a standalone."}, {"userName": "Repix Pix", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8735103-repix-pix", "userReview": "Una trama muy bien tejida que te descoloca y hace que sospeches de unos u otros en cada cap\u00edtulo.

An eleven year murder resurfaces when the convicted killer is released back into the small town community and a 17yr old goes missing. However, something much more harrowing and sinister is unearthed as Detective Inspector Pia Kirchhoff digs deep into the investigation eleven years earlier and discovers holes in the prosecution. Revisiting the case yields new information and the discovery of a deep seeded plan of corruption and corroboration by townsfolk in high positions directly relating to the murders of Laura and Stefanie. While Bondenstien, Pia\u2019s boss investigates crimes of the present day targeted against Tobias and his family.It\u2019s easily apparent that the two lead detectives have featured in previous books (which I believe have not yet been translated to English) yet Neuhaus writes them so well that their respective back-stories are explained through a drip feed of information throughout the course of the novel meaning the pre-reads aren\u2019t a necessity. While the plot drives SNOW WHITE MUST DIE, it\u2019s the well rounded and beautifully crafted characters that really engross the reader. I was surprised to find myself sympathising with the originally touted killer of Snow White, the convicted Tobias and his family (with whom suffered unjustly for crimes they weren\u2019t privy) and rode the bumpy personal rollercoaster of Bodenstein\u2019s domestic situation and Pia\u2019s struggle to maintain her home despite a rather unfair land ownership mishap. SNOW WHITE MUST DIE contains jaw dropping scenes of cruelty inflicted upon the unjust by perpetrators fuelled by their murderous convictions. The constant shift and change of direction makes it hard to pinpoint who is on the right side of the law. Neuhaus slides her characters around a proverbial chest board to craft this deeply engrossing crime fiction. No one is who they seem to be and I had a great time trying to guess the outcome. I hope more of the German books in this series get translated as not only would they compliment SNOW WHITE MUST DIE (the 4th book in the series \u2013 though it reads well as a standalone) but it would also bring new meaning to some of the minor character interactions, notably those within the police force itself. This is one of those books you can\u2019t help but read. When I wasn\u2019t reading it, I was thinking about it, and when I was reading it I didn\u2019t want it to end. Few police procedurals have drawn me in like SNOW WHITE MUST DIE.

I assumed that it was likely to be in the style of some of the Scandi crime novels that have taken over the crime world; and in many ways I was right to make this assumption. Set in small town Germany, in the shadow of the mountains this is a very dark story about a double murder and the lengths the locals go to to ensure that the truth remains hidden. This is the fourth story in the series in the original German, and at times it shows just a little. Some familiarity with the characters of the police involved is implied from time to time. I do understand why publishers release these translated versions out of sequence sometimes but it is still a little annoying when it happens, especially if you don't realise until you've read the whole thing (as happened with Alex by Pierre Lemaitre earlier in the year) Anyway.......... this novel has some wonderfully creepy scenes and some totally deranged characters and manages to pull them together into a really competent whole.

Does that sound easy? It's not, proven by how many failed authors litter the literary highway. If Neuhaus keeps writing like this, she won't have to worry about failing.This is the tale of a double murder where a high school boy is found guilty and sentenced to ten years in prison. While he served his time, the small town that had nurtured and protected him for twenty years drove his parents out of business and treated them as pariah--despite that he never confessed to the crime, didn't remember doing it, and the bodies were never found. The story begins with his return when it becomes clear someone is not only unhappy he is back and afraid of the truths that might still come out. This mystery is a rich interweaving of setting and story. The taste and scent of European village life permeates everything and the characters provide a window on a world most of us will never experience. Although the book nicely wraps readers into the drama of a high school wonder boy who falls from grace, is convicted of murder, and returns home to try to restart his life after paying his societal dues, there were a few bumps along the way: * Despite the sensational name, it doesn't encapsulate the story. Yes, there is a character nicknamed 'Snow White', but she's dead. No one runs through the plot figuring out how to kill her. In fact, the story unravels why she did die. Since publishers name novels, I wonder what Neuhaus originally called this one--Why Did Snow White Die? or Tobias Must Die. Granted, neither of those has the sensationalism of the current title. * I found it hard to believe Tobias would have a second black out just in time for another girl to disappear. When it happened, I figured someone was causing him to black out, but no, it was coincidence. Hmm... The last 25% of the story bogs down in drama that doesn't move the plot forward. I ended up skimming chunks of the late chapters without missing anything. What Neuhaus thought to be tension-building was actually pace-stalling. * the book never ended. Every time it reached a natural conclusion, something else popped up. * Why is it set four years in the past? Is this intended for some reason that isn't explained or did it take four years to get the book from the author's computer to my early-reader hands? If the latter, that's frightening for would-be writers and one measure why publishers have difficulty competing with Indies. These are likely new author issues. What can't be argued is that Neuhaus is a talented, expressive writer who knows how to tell a story and is the reason I gave it four stars. I look forward to more of her work."}, {"userName": "Larraine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6092728-larraine", "userReview": "I must confess that I almost returned this book unread after picking it up from the library. The description sounded lurid. What had made me reserve this book? That's the problem with long term library reserves. You see a book, reserve it from the library, wait patiently for your turn. A couple of months or longer have passed, and you forget why you asked for it to begin with! Well, I'm glad I didn't return it. The book is written by a popular German author, Nele Neuhaus, someone I hadn't heard about before since this is her first book translated into English. I admit to having a special spot in my heart reserved for Germany since I lived there for seven years. I only wish I had learned enough German to read the original. Hopefully, more of Ms. Neuhaus' books will be translated because this is a real page turner. The book opens with Tobias Sartorius returning home to his village of Altenhain after 10 yrs in prison for killing two young women as a \"juvenile.\" His conviction was based on circumstantial evidence since it couldn't be absolutely proven that he had killed them. However, nobody believed that he blacked out after a night of heavy drinking. He comes back to his home village to find that his mother and father are divorced and his father's property has fallen into disrepair. The rest of the village had shunned his parents for years, and someone has sprayed his father's former inn with red spray paint that says \"a murderer lives here.\" Not long after he comes back, another young woman disappears after his former friends embrace him and they have a night of heavy drinking together. The author also intertwines the personal lives of the squad in the story. There's Pia who is living with a wonderful man after a disappointing first marriage. Her boss is a member of the upper classes - hence the \"von\" in front of his first name. However, the power and the money in his life come from his wife, a filmmaker. Meanwhile, the residents of Altenhain know a lot more than they let on as they maintain a \"Sicilian code\" of silence.

I couldn't keep away for long and I spent most of the weekend buried deep in its pages :-)It begins with Tobias' release from jail after serving a ten-year sentence for murder, a murder that he was convicted of but possibly didn\u2019t actually commit? The question of innocence and guilt is a continuing topic throughout the story. His release triggers some evil forces in his home town as the residents are outraged about his freedom and also are very distrustful of him. Only his childhood best friend and a young girl new to the town treat him with a bit of compassion. It is this humanity that could prove deadly for the young girl?The situation turns even uglier when the young girl vanishes without a trace AND the body of one of the girls Tobias was convicted of killing is found. This prompts a renewed investigation into the original murder case and a full fledge effort into finding the missing girl. A unique pair of police investigators make the cases their priority and they work well together, each has personal baggage which they bring to work and this helps to lighten the mood.The descriptive writing will draw you in to the lies, the greed, the violence, the murderous conspiracy theories and ultimately into the path to justice. The constant change in direction makes it a challenge to pinpoint the right side of the law and I found I was continuously doubting myself and changing my mind.
