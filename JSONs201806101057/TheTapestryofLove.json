An English author, named, Rosy Thornton, has once again allowed us to think about our guilty pleasure of getting away from our bustling life once and for all.  The Tapestry of Love by Rosy Thornton is a poignant combination of happy solitude away in some French countryside up in the mountains to sad, and monotonous life away in England. Also Thornton's magnificent tapestry of silk and love have managed to spin this tale into something rich and highly remarkable. While reading this book, I was constantly thinking of a house with French windows and terrace up in some hills having a small garden with the pathway leading into the dense forest, which is inhabited by the wild boars and rabbits and sheep. Thanks to Rosy Thornton for a paperback copy of The Tapestry of Love, in return for an honest review. Catherine, who is her near 50s, has been divorced for 7 years with a grown-up daughter, Lexie, and a son, Tom, in England. But one fine day, she sells her old life, pack up her belongings and set-away for her new home in a quiet French hillside, Cevennes Mountains. Her neighbors are just like her, simple, kind and helpful, especially, Mr. Bouschet, who helps her settle in her new home. Soon she gets acquainted with her other neighbors, like the dashing and mysterious farmer named, Patrick Castagnol and the good ol' Madame Bouschet. She sets up her business of making tapestries for divans and curtains and eventually her business flourishes, she becomes closer to Patrick, but not for a single moment she stops missing her children or her mother or her sister. But when her sis, Bryony comes to stay with her, things gets heated up between Patrick and Bryony, leaving Catherine feel jealous. But slowly her life takes a different turn and things that were supposed to happen, didn't happen in that way and leaving Catherine on the crossroads of her old life in England or her brave, new life in the Cevennes Mountains. From bee-keeping to reading a paperback by the stream, Catherine's ideal life is an epitome of solitude as well as peace and freedom. Catherine was worried that she never seen a wild boar in the forest, but when she saw one, she didn't had anyone in her life to tell about it. It was the moment of pure bliss and joy, equally leaving her sad that she had no one currently to share it with- I felt sorry for her, leaving in a perfect and such impressionistic countryside, doesn't always bound to give you all joy freedom, if you are living there all alone, but Catherine is resourceful and brave and determined to lead her life in solitude. From the outside, life was perfect, from the inside, it was lonely and sad. She missed her daughter, Lexie and son, Tom, a lot, especially, her mother, who was suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s. Now about her business of creating tapestries for simple things in home, have given us a glimpse of what the French Bureaucracy is capable of, they can only allow to set up agricultural or tourism business up in the hills, and since Catherine's business didn\u2019t fall into that category, she couldn't get a license to her business. The author's use of simplistic words has made the plot sound so simple, beautiful and enchanting and her vivid description of life had made it more enthralling to read the book. The tale is very French from French culture to language to culinary habits- everything had made the book so delectable. The characters are well-developed, from Catherine's chatty and fickle-minded daughter, Lexie to her intelligent and reserved son, Tom to her career-minded and casual sister, Bryony to her sweet and helpful, ex-husband, Graeme to the very English and very brooding, Patrick- each one of the characters influences the day-to-day characters that we often meet. Life, family, closeness and friendliness and wild boars- everything totally sums up a perfect French read in the afternoons! You might find yourself letting yourself away from the husty-busty city life to some quiet countryside, while reading this book. This book is a total re-treat away from our daily, monotonous lifestyle and is bound to spellbind you into its enticing descriptions."}, {"userName": "CLM", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/206027-clm", "userReview": "Very enjoyable, especially the food descriptions.

Catherine has chosen to follow her dream of life in a rural idyll in the C\u00e9vennes mountains of France. It's an adjustment for the 48 year old woman who has left behind family and friends for an isolated cottage in a tiny hamlet. Slowly Catherine makes a place for herself in the community, forming tentative friendships with her neighbors, including the enigmatic Patrick Castagnol. Catherine can be admired for her decision to begin a new life, as well as her determination to make it work. She doesn't intrude on the local community, instead making the effort to become part of it which speaks to her character. She accepts and overcomes the minor inconveniences she encounters, adjusting her lifestyle to suit the environs. There is romance for Catherine, not one I fully endorse to be honest as I didn't think much of Patrick's behaviour. However the affair is only a small part of Catherine's 'tapestry of love' and I believe that Thornton's title refers to the relationships, past, present and future, that make us who we are, and sustain us even in their physical absence.The book wends it's way at a leisurely pace through the challenges Catherine faces establishing herself, and the life and characters in the rustic farming community. The book requires you to surrender to the measured contentment of the landscape, rather than concern for where the story may be going. Thornton's descriptions of Catherine's environment are stunningly eloquent extolling it's charm and beauty. It is easy to imagine the picturesque views, the family of boar cavorting in the woods and the comforting curl of smoke from the chimney, all of which are sure to evoke daydreams of escape to such serenity. While I took great pleasure in Thornton's spectacularly expressive writing, I'm not sure it compensated entirely for the lack of drama. The momentum of the story is very subtle, until twin tragedies in the last quarter or so of the novel force decisive action from Catherine.The Tapestry of Love is a graceful and warm novel of subtle emotion and gorgeous landscape. What may well be an oasis in the frantic pace of everyday life, the books vibrant prose will capture your imagination, The Tapestry of Love is an engaging read."}, {"userName": "Amy Meyer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465116-amy-meyer", "userReview": "Title: The Tapestry of LoveAuthor: Rosy ThorntonISBN: 978-0-7553-4557-1Pages: 352Release Date: October 14, 2010Publisher: Headline Book PublishingGenre: Contemporary FictionRating: 4.5 out of 5Summary: A rural idyll: that's what Catherine Parkstone is seeking when she sells her house in England and moves to a tiny hamlet in the C\u00e9vennes mountains. Divorced and with her children grown, she is free to make a new start, and set up in business as a seamstress. But this is a harsh and lonely place when you're no longer just on holiday, and Catherine finds herself with unexpected battles to fight. French bureaucracy, the mountain weather, the reserve of her neighbours - and most unsettling of all, her own fascination with the intriguing Patrick Castagnol.The Tapestry of Love is the story of how a woman falls in love with a place and its people: a portrait of landscape, a community and a fragile way of life.My thoughts: I found reading The Tapestry of Love similar to taking a long, leisurely walk on a beautiful day in a rural, mostly uninhabited area. The journey is calm and peaceful for the most part, although you're occasionally startled by strange sounds or unexpected movements and noises in the brush. But the experience is extremely enjoyable and relaxing, particularly when you come upon a beautiful lake to sit beside while eating your lunch and basking in the warm, serene sun as small birds twitter overhead. The Tapestry of Love is a peaceful story about a woman who leaves the life she knows to risk following her dream of living in the French countryside where she spent idyllic holidays as a child with her family.Author Rosy Thornton's writing is thoughtful and draws us in, keeping the story flowing at a leisurely, steady pace. Then main character is the admirable and interesting Catherine, a middle-aged English woman, seven years divorced with her daughter, Lexie and her son, Tom, grown and out on their own. She is a strong, resourceful woman who transforms her life in a way many of us can admire, perhaps even envy. But along the way, Catherine realistically questions her decision to move to the French countryside alone and start a new business. She knows no one and her plan wasn't well-thought out and researched. She acted more on a whim.Ms. Thornton doesn't allow the story to stagnate. She includes captivating, occasionally irritating, characters in Catherine's life, such as her bubbly, warm, daughter, Lexie, a journalist, who telephones frequently to complain about whichever bizarre magazine she is writing for at the moment. And her neighbor, Patrick Castagnol, the reserved Frenchman (or so Catherine believes) with a disconcerting habit of suddenly appearing at Catherine's front door but offering little about himself. From the first time they meet, we think there's an attraction between Catherine and Patrick but they are too quiet, reserved and well-mannered to act on their feelings so we cannot be sure...but we can hope and wait anxiously!As in real life, the most beautiful, serene settings occasionally experience storm clouds gathering on the horizon, threatening to destroy the peace for a little while. The \"storm clouds\" in The Tapestry of Love are Catherine's younger sister, Bryony, a lawyer in London whom she loves but doesn't feel she really knows well. Bryony is busy, hard-working and quite confident. She dates a lot of different men and wants and expects to be noticed, to command the attention of men and women. Bryony is very intelligent, outspoken and opinionated. She has little of Catherine's thoughtfulness and I don't think she appreciates her older sister. Bryony is also used to getting what she wants like so many people we've all encountered in life. And like those people, Catherine probably shouldn't trust Bryony. By the time the story ends, Catherine will know her and some of her neighbors much better.As the title suggests, Catherine is a tapestry needlewoman and her love of tapestry is an effective vehicle for seeing into her thoughts throughout the book and getting to know her well. This does not make for an action packed story. However, what this does is make the writing taut in order to keep things interesting, something the author does very well. Additionally, I learned about tapestries, the delicate and difficult work that goes into making them as well as the beautiful silk threads that bring them to life. I also learned about the needlework required to create soft furnishings such as cushions and curtains as well as about bee keeping, sheep migration and other surprising, interesting things. Ms. Thornton even includes some enjoyable levity in the phone calls between Catherine and Lexie in which her daughter regales her with humorous anecdotes about her experiences writing feature articles for magazines such as Air Cargo Monthly and Fondant Magazine!This is probably not a book for readers who enjoy adventure, murder mysteries or the paranormal. Or men, in general. Not to pigeonhole this as a book just for women because it isn't, but the pace, style and it's \"go where it may\" wanderings, without any problem-solving focus, means it wouldn't appeal to most men. I believe this book would be most appreciated by women, who, like the main character, are looking for something different. A journey that's out of the way in a place that offers breath-taking vistas and new experiences, that are comforting and peaceful but allow for taking risks, gleaning knowledge you may not get anywhere else. If this description interests you then The Tapestry of Love is a book for you. It's a book I highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Yvonne (Fiction Books)", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31492952-yvonne-fiction-books", "userReview": "\"Leaves you with a warm feeling, long after it has ended.\"Until I started to see the reviews of this book, appearing on various blogs and was then, myself, contacted by the author, I have to admit that Rosy Thornton was not a name I was familiar with.So many of you have already written some fantastic reviews about this book, that I fear many of the superlative adjectives have been expressed more than once ... but here goes with my thoughts about the book.The beautiful cover art, caught my attention immediately and set the scene in my imagination, before I had even started to read.Right from the start, there is a feeling of the author's warmth and empathy, towards both her characters and their environment.All the characters are alive and believeable, evolving and establishing themselves, throughout the length of the story, as relationships are formed and changed.Brilliantly descriptive passages about the remote and often difficult mountainous conditions, that still allow the beauty and majesty of the scenery to shine through.The sense of community and co-operation that exists in such an insular society, where neighbours are just that, through a small kindness or spontaneous act of friendship, and ties, once made, are strong and permanent.The plot is relatively simple, yet the romance is so beautifully developed and so moving, in no way rushed, allowing Catherine and Patrick all the time in the world to explore their relationship and their feelings for one another.A relationship that is almost threatened by sibling rivalry between Catherine and her sister Bryony, who visits from England. The changing relationship between the sisters is dealt with sympathetically and with great thought, as they are both forced to come to terms and deal with, their own vulnerability, following the death of a loved one.All these attributes, taken together, add up to a relaxing, warm and inviting love story, both between Catherine and Patrick and between Catherine and her new found self and sense of inner peace.I was with Catherine as she settles into her new life, not just watching from the side-lines, but actually there and part of the experience. Almost feeling the sense of excitement, yet feeling her vulnerability and trepidation, as she embarks on her chosen new life alone,without the support network of friends and family that she is accustomed to and vowing not to look back, knowing that I would probably never be brave enough to change the course of my own life in such a drastic way.The unhurried pace of settling into her new home, where each detail is so vivid that I could imagine myself sitting on the porch of this beautiful, yet isolated cottage, drinking in those fantastic views and recalling similar views from my own lovely holidays in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland.Everyday events and tasks, that hitherto would have been mundane and performed rote, now become interesting and new, with me beside her every step of the way.Her passion and love for creating her tapestry pieces, by which she hopes to make a name for herself and her uncertainty and frustration, when having to deal with the alien business rules and regulations of the region, all show her vulnerability, yet growing inner strength when she is able to achieve even the smallest of victories. Would I have been so calm and circumspect? I doubt it!! and oh! to be so artistic and talented, it made me quite envious.This is a well structured journey through the first year of Catherine's new life, with all its changing seasons. The uncertainties of change, the sadness and loss of saying a final goodbye to a loved one, turning her back on all that is familiar and safe, and the slow awakening of a passion and romance such as she could never have imagined.Definitely a book to savour and one that left me with a warm and cosy feeling, long after it had ended"}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/904493-kirsty", "userReview": "When Rosy Thornton contacted me via my blog to ask if I'd like to review her book, I wasn't sure whether to accept at first. This is not the kind of novel that I usually read and to be honest I probably wouldn't have picked this up in a bookstore, but I decided to give it a chance because I do like reading about other countries and it has had some great reviews. Having read it, it's clear that I need to re-think how I choose my books in bookstores because I thoroughly enjoyed it.Catherine was an instantly likeable character. She's incredibly strong willed yet down-to-earth and simply refuses to let anything bring her down. Throughout the book there are a number of occuring problems that would cause a lesser person to become self-pitying but this is never the case with Catherine and I loved her for it. Despite the fact that Catherine is much older than me, I was still able to relate to her and I felt a real affinity for her need to escape and to experience a different way of life. I also grew to really like the supporting characters in the book, especially Monsieur and Madame Bouschet. I loved the way that they took Catherine under their wing and it was nice to see the relationship build between the three. Patrick was an interesting character and it took me longer to warm to him, but I did eventually and it was interesting to see Catherine's relationship with him develop also.The plot is brilliant in it's simplicity. It's simply a tale of life. There is no mystery, there is no huge twist and there are no vampires, but it's a compelling read. Everytime I picked this book up, I lost myself in the French way of life and I really didn't want to leave. I wanted to stay in the gorgeous French countryside, the slow, relaxed way of life and the sense of belonging and community that comes with living in such a small village. The images painted throughout the book of the mountains and the surrounding area just made me want to get on a plane as soon as possible - the authors use of description is just enough to make you feel like you're there, but not too much that it overshadows the rest of the book.This book is just beautiful. I could have easily read another 300 pages without becoming bored. I will definitely be looking into Rosy Thornton's previous works."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50378-angie", "userReview": "I ran across my first reference to THE TAPESTRY OF LOVE over on The Zen Leaf and immediately wanted to read it after coming across Amanda's comment:It was warm, comforting, and homey, and the prose was beautiful without ever jarring me.That described exactly the kind of book I was in the mood for at the time. By a new-to-me UK author. And set in the French countryside? I wanted it. I wanted it now. Unfortunately, it somehow slipped through the cracks and I didn't end up ordering a copy immediately. But it wasn't long before I received Rosy Thornton's previous novel, Crossed Wires, as a gift and figured I may as well start there. I immediately liked Ms. Thornton's writing style and the so-very-real way her characters went about living their lives. So it was with great pleasure I opened up a package in the mail a little while later to find my very own copy of THE TAPESTRY OF LOVE. Falling into this story was as easy as pie.Catherine Parkstone has just made one of the biggest decisions of her life. At the age of 48, she's been divorced for a while now and is fairly certain she's ready to move on with her life. In this case, moving on entails picking up her tomato plants and her threads and using almost all of her modest savings to purchase a cottage in an infinitesimally small village in France's Cevennes mountains. Yes, it shocks her kids. And her ex-husband. And basically anyone who ever knew her. But to Catherine it just feels right. And she doesn't regret it for a moment. Though her French isn't exactly up to par and sometimes the solitude can creep in unawares, it is with a lightening of the heart and a surge of hope that she takes to her new home and its curious denizens. Hanging out her shingle as a professional seamstress, Catherine sets about getting to know the locals and her easy way with people and quiet independence wins her a place in their hearts, though her nearby neighbor Patrick Castagnol is a bit of an enigma. Even if he does brew his own beer and cook her dinners like a master chef. Then one day, out of the blue, Catherine's sister Bryony arrives in need of a holiday, and the fragile balance Catherine has achieved threatens to crumble under the weight of her sister's forceful personality.Okay. Favorite thing about this book, hands down? Catherine is so unapologetically herself and the rest of the characters are so exquisitely fraught with shades of grey. No villains. No angels. Just life in all its messy glory. And the beautiful, beautiful French countryside, French food, and Catherine's careful hands and rainbow of threads binding it all together. It sounds strange, but I am often so very gratified to be neatly foiled in my attempts to hate certain characters. You see, Catherine is a very likable character. And a couple of other characters (who should seriously know better, in my opinion) get in the way of her happiness. And such things can try my patience with them. But Rosy Thornton did an excellent job of presenting these actions in the context of their complicated history together, their individual fears, wants, and needs. And I could see it all laid out. The way it inevitably came together in just the way it did, like Catherine's tapestry of the saint in his boat, sailing for the shore. It was lovely in its imperfection. And I was so very happy with the way it ended. This is a quiet book and, like Patrick (and Catherine, for that matter), it is not given to effusion. But also like those two characters, it is wonderfully mature, full of hidden depths and shades of beauty. THE TAPESTRY OF LOVE is a book I could easily hand anyone, knowing they will likely fall for its simple, eloquent charms just as I did.

This was such a fun read that transported me to an idyllic, well almost, life style abroad, in this case the Cevennes mountains at the southern end of the Massif Central in France. The kind of life style abroad that I know many of us dream of and some of us are even lucky enough to be given the opportunity to experience. While where I live in Italy is not the harsh lonely place that the protagonist Catherine chooses to call home, there are many similarities that made me smile. Catherine Parkstone, divorced for a number of years with adult children decides to seek a rural lifestyle in an old stone farmhouse on the outskirts of La Grelaudiere a tiny hamlet amongst the chestnut woods on the slopes of Mont Lozere. The book tells the story of Catherine\u2019s gradually emerging love affair with the place, the nature around her and of becoming friends with reserved neighbours. The title comes from the fact that she sets herself up as a seamstress, not without some opposition from local bureaucracy. Beautifully written I found I very quickly became attuned to Catherine as she coped with not just the emotions of moving abroad but personal highs and lows concerning family, community, love and loss. Besides Catherine there is an interesting array of other characters to meet and her descriptive writing to savour. Savour is the right word to use as not only does she describe so well the surroundings but you can almost taste the food she talks about.I do not like to give away too much about the plot or story in my reviews as my intention is to encourage you to read the book for yourself not tell you the story! If this a genre you would normally enjoy, then I recommend it highly. I hope I have tempted some of you to read The Tapestry of Love as it is such a cheering read, that certainly lives up to the many enthusiastic reviews I have seen in the blogsphere.Until a few months ago I had never even heard of Rosy Thornton which is a shame as I feel sure I would enjoy her previous three published novels. I have now added them to my wish list on Goodreads, More Than Love Letters, Hearts And Minds, and Crossed Wires. My excuse for not discovering this author before now is probably because her first novel was not published until 2006 after we had left the UK, it is not so easy to keep up to date with new authors when living abroad but I now do so by following Book Blogs. I was introduced to Rosy, by her getting in contact with me, albeit virtually by the fact that we have two author friends in common. I believe she had also seen some of my other reviews. I was very pleased to have the opportunity to get to know her and to read and review The Tapestry of Love as she so kindly sent me a copy.Rosy Thornton is a Goodreads Author and on my blog post at LindyLouMac's Book Reviews I have reposted some of her profile information, plus photos and information about her inspiration for this novel.

I loved the setting in rural France. I loved the Catherine character and I am always excited for any woman who is brave enough to start a whole new chapter of her life in another country. Descriptions of places, actions and things certainly makes a story come alive, but in this book the author goes way overboard with it for my liking. The endless descriptions in detail made this book very tedious for me to get through. Most of the book to me is describing things, places and actions. Unless you love that type of writing style it can be challenging. I don't much care for it and that is mostly why I gave this book only 3 stars. The endless descriptions was bordering on boring for me Strangely enough there was very little descriptions of how the characters looked. I wondered all through this story what Catherine looked like.I suspected that Patrick was in love with Catherine all along; even after Bryony came to visit and he slept with her the evening she had dinner with him alone while Catherine had business to tend to. I wondered why he did it. Why did he further entertain Bryony during her sabbatical? Why if he loved Catherine would he sleep with her sister? His explanation at the end I found to be so 21st century male. John Thornton in N&S would have been more respectful of the woman he loved. Well, at least Patrick did admit to being no saint. I was disappointed in Catherine's reaction when she figured out that Bryony and Patrick slept together the night before. She was way too passive about it. Her sister intruded on her budding relationship with Patrick and that is just not acceptable behavior. I am sure that Bryony knew from the start that Patrick cared very much for Catherine.The premise of this story is a good one, but for me the telling of it was done in a tediously drawn out way. I have read many love stories before that were just as long, but I was kept a lot more engaged and interested as I kept reading. By the middle of this book I was looking forward to finishing it. I was thrilled that Patrick finally told Catherine how much he cares for her and that it was always \"Cat-rine\". Their overall relationship is not quite the romance-love story that I thought it was going to be.Please do not let my review of this book stop you from reading it. It is a good story."}, {"userName": "Lydia Laceby", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3322071-lydia-laceby", "userReview": "Originally Reviewed at Novel EscapesThe Tapestry of Love was a richly drawn read about starting over amidst uncertainty. I loved the premise along with the novelty of a story set in France, but unfortunately, I wasn't as drawn into the story as I wanted to be. The details about the area, the terrain and neighbours was initially fascinating, but my interest soon waned as it continued throughout much of the first half of the novel. As a positive, I could picture the setting vividly, but unfortunately I couldn't find much plot to hold onto until the later half. Even early in the novel when Catherine's sister visits and throws a glitch in her ideal rural fantasy, I found Catherine's reaction passive where I'd hoped she'd take action. Her struggles against the French bureaucracy was a major theme of the book according to it's synopsis, but it didn't actually begin until well past half way through the novel, and even though it was interesting, overall, it wasn't much of a glitch of conflict.There were a few moments that snuck up on me emotionally that I wasn't expecting, which I enjoyed. I also liked the subplot of her struggles with her mother's Alzheimer's and that her relationship with her ex-husband was amicable, finding her thoughts on both realistic and conflicting. However, because they were both physically distant we only saw these relationships through her thoughts, which I found didn't give me much to grab onto. While Thornton definitely has a flair for words, I wished The Tapestry of Love was less wordy with the description and had a bit more conflict and plot to sink my teeth into. I'm curious to see how Kathryn feels about this one. I think she might enjoy it more, having spent time in France and with her typically enjoying small town stories."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Ashworth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2009942-elizabeth-ashworth", "userReview": "I've read all of Rosy Thornton's previous books and it's been interesting to watch her journey as a writer. Although I enjoyed the others I thought that this was something special - there was a confidence and maturity about the writing that moved it from good to really very good indeed.The character of Catherine Parkstone was captured so well that I feel I really know this woman - I understand her emotions, her desire to begin a new life set against her underlying guilt at leaving her old life behind. Even though her children are grown up and her mother no longer knows her she is never quite comfortable in her new life in France until many of these issues are resolved. And then there is her sister and Patrick - and sibling rivalry in the subtle yet emotionally charged relationship between them.But I think it is the description of the French countryside that will remain with me. I don't know this region but I feel that I've been given a glimpse of it with all its rich seasons and the scenery and the transhumance, not to mention Catherine's garden and her bees. The setting of the story was in many ways the star character. But then so were her French neighbours and her daughter and even the couple with the donkey.

I had not read any of her previous books so I have read this with fresh eyes. My personal taste, I love romance. This is my all time favourite genre; and this book is not quite the romance I thought it was so I felt a little disappointed. But as I said - that is just my personal taste. The book is very well written and instantly catapults the reader into the French countryside. You feel totally at home in the mountains in Cevennes! Rosy writes the characters really well and you become immersed in Catherine's life, going through the ups and downs with her. Catherine Parkstone uproots and moves to the Cevennes, at the age of 49, to start a new life. She sets up home at Les Fenils and also her tapestry business (which comes up with some problems later in the book). Throughout the book she has to deal with tragedy, sadness, possible love, loss and many more emotions on the rollercoaster of her new life. This story is about starting fresh and the trials that comes with it. It's about family, community, love and France with it's beautiful landscape."}, {"userName": "Serena", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1349220-serena", "userReview": "Rosy Thornton\u2018s The Tapestry of Love follows 48-year-old Catherine Parkstone as she makes her way through the French countryside after leaving her home in England following her divorce.

I would give it 4 plus stars because the writing is superb in many ways especially the author's description of life in rural France(Cevennes); however,this is supposed to be a romance but that aspect takes such a subtle background to the story that I kept wondering when it was going to happen? And then the love interest does something that makes me very, very, angry. I really found my self wanting much more interaction between Catherine and Patrick especially after their relationship FINALLY starts up in earnest.Spoiler, This may be a French guy thing, but here is a clue for Patrick: if you are interested in a woman do not sleep with her sister for 3 months!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/254596-mary", "userReview": "You can read my review here"}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1519907-hilary", "userReview": "http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/746698-heather", "userReview": "When Catherine leaves England to settle in the C\u00e9vennes mountains, she's hoping for a simple and rustic life. Surrounded by the dense woods and the idyllic mountains, her neighbors immediately adopt her into their community. From the older couple who share her land and help her with the maintenance of her property to the older widow who enlists Catherine to help her into town, Catherine is at once enveloped in France. But when she meets another neighbor, the handsome and mysterious Patrick, Catherine begins to question all she has known about attraction and love. As she settles in the beautiful French countryside, Catherine decides to become a self-employed business woman, weaving tapestries and working with fabrics on interior design. But there are some serious snafus when her sister Bryony comes to town for an extended getaway and is immediately enraptured by Patrick, and her interior design business hits a roadblock due to government restrictions. Just when Catherine thinks she's home free and that her feelings for Patrick have been quashed, the situation changes once again, leaving her more confused than ever. As the months roll by, Catherine becomes deeply involved in all aspects of rural life, from the ties to the locals, to her business, to the very perplexing feelings for Patrick that she can't seem to jettison, and discovers that life in this blissful and remote area is not only what her soul craves, but what her heart desires. Like the tapestries Catherine weaves, Thornton takes all the exquisite colors of the French countryside and Catherine's life, and creates a stunning representation of one woman's existence filled with the subtle dramas and grace that we all hope to capture in our own lives.Sometimes I crave a good quiet read that renews my spirit and gives me things to contemplate. I had been reading many reviews of this book on the blogosphere and began to think it would be a great reading experience. When Rosy Thornton contacted me and asked me if I'd like a chance to review it, I snapped to attention and responded in the affirmative right away. The book didn't disappoint, and it was just the type of read that I could relax into like a hot bath during a time in my life that was rather stressful and worrying. As life was doing its best to turn my heart into a pretzel, I knew that I could have respite within these pages and I grew to love the time I spent with this story.Catherine was a character whom I loved from the instant I began reading about her. She was so strong-willed, and no matter what disappointments were hanging over her head, she never gave in to self-pity and recrimination. Some of the things that she went through required a strong heart and a tough spirit, and Catherine had that in spades. When she meets Patrick for the first time, theirs is an electric attraction, and there's noting unrequited about her feelings for him. As he gently coaxes her into his life, Catherine begins to bloom like a rose under his ministrations. There was a lot of passion between these two people, but Thornton shares these revelations with a subdued and graceful hand, and the effect is one of total realism. Catherine is a woman in her middle age but her heart is no less moved or passionate than that of a younger woman at Patrick's tender behavior. When her sister Bryony comes into the picture and basically usurps Patrick, the tension Catherine experiences forces her to reexamine her feelings, not only for her sister, but for the man who has so enraptured her. She doesn't fret and whine about it though, and instead employs a great deal of patience and understanding, preferring to put Patrick and Bryony in the background and moving the other parts of her life into the foreground.Another thing that was great about this book was its rustic appeal. I'm sort of a city girl, but I had not a bit of trouble appreciating the sections in which Catherine tends to her garden, or her forays into French cooking. I liked the quiet feel of the writing in these sections and it was constantly edifying to my soul to read about the wild mushrooms found in the woods and the elusive pack of wild boars that Catherine observes. There was something so charming and genteel about the life she was living out in the French countryside, and many times while reading I would drift off into daydreams about escaping the city to find solace in the woods and mountains. There was such a feeling of cohesion and peace within Catherine's life out there, and I found that a lot of these sections gave the book such charm. Reading about Catherine's day-to-day life in the C\u00e9vennes mountains made me at once feel relaxed and put me in a very peaceful frame of mind, which is something that I desperately needed.The focus on the tapestries and Catherine's various other handicrafts was also something to be admired. I didn't know very much about this form of artistry before reading this book, but Thornton had a way of explaining everything so clearly that even a layperson could get caught up in it. Her descriptions of the work Catherine did and the dying and collecting of thread struck me as very knowledgeable, and I wondered many times if Thornton herself engaged in tapestry making, such was the level of expertise that she created in her story. I also liked that Catherine's artwork was so appreciated and sought after by the locals because so often crafts and art are things that are pursued and appreciated alone. The aspect of a single woman living in France and being such an expert needlewoman somehow appealed to some of my softer and more creative emotions. Often times, when one doesn't participate in a craft like this, reading about it can be alienating or just plain boring, which is something that Thornton very successfully escapes in her work.I was so enthralled with this book and I think I read it at a perfect time in my life. The quietness and rustic qualities really spoke to me in a way that had a healing effect on me during a rough patch I was having, and I would be interested in re-reading this book at another time to examine other aspects of the story that Thornton so expertly crafted. It's a love story, yes, but also, and I think more importantly, a story about a woman who is strong, independent and wise, and who takes a chance on a life that not many of us will ever experience. I think this book would appeal to a lot of readers and it would be a great read to curl up with on a rainy afternoon. A great and gentle read.

However, when I began to read it, I instantly knew that this book wasn't going to keep me on my toes. I found that the storyline of Catherine was quite boring, and much too predictable. I knew that Patrick wasn't interested in her sister, Bryony, from the start, and that Catherine would end up with him in the end. I felt that the relationships in which Catherine had with her neighbours were a bit flawed; there was hardly any depth to what was discussed between them, with Catherine mostly focusing on her bees, or seeing the boar. I would have wished that there was more character building between them, which would have been more interesting to read. Also, there was no 'climax' in the plot that made me say 'wow', or want to continue reading to see what would happen afterwards. I was just trying to finish this book to see if anything of surprise would really stand-out in my mind.

So, when Rosy Thornton mailed me about reviewing her book, The Tapestry of Love, I was thrilled. I had never read a book based in the French countryside before.I fell in love with the book right from the minute I opened the package and set my eyes on the cover of the book: An old door painted white with splotches of greenery around it.The book starts languorously with Rosy describing the Transhumance, a bi-yearly ritual common to the mountain regions of France where sheep are herded up and down the slopes of the mountains depending on the time of the year.During the autumn transhumance sheep are herded from the grasslands in the mountains down the slopes to the valleys and during the spring transhumance the process is reversed. Catherine is a divorcee who moves to a hamlet in the Ce'vennes Mountains from London.She is an empty Nester with her children, Lexie and Tom grown up and busy with their own lives . She decides to start her own business as a seamstress in the idyllic rural environment.At the Ce'vennes, Catherine has to contend with loneliness, stiff neighbors and horrible weather. We are introduced to the Bouschets, Madame Volipere, the Merriels and Patrick Castagnol. Her neighbors are gracious and invite Catherine over for tea and meals , but their requests are formal. Catherine strikes up an easy friendship with Patrick as their conversations cover subjects as varied as bee-keeping, boars ,lepers and saints. As paragraph upon paragraph rolled by describing Catherine\u2019s life, I could feel her loneliness myself. But the narrative is not depressing at any point.I loved Catherine\u2019s character-strong and warm.Despite her divorce, she is not bitter about her husband seeing another woman .Catherine embraces her new life selling her cushion covers and upholstering furniture to the locals . Everything rolls by smoothly until her sister, Bryonne decides to visit her. Now, Bryonne is everything Catherine is not- perky and leads an extremely successful life as a partner in a London law firm.During Bryonne\u2019s visit Catherine realizes that both of them are falling for the same man. But the man has secrets that he holds close to his heart himself. The rest of the story is about how Catherine befriends the neighbors, becomes an integral part of the neighborhood, how she strives to get her enterprise registered and makes sense of the feelings she has towards Patrick.The strong points of the book are the depth with which each character is etched out,Rosy\u2019s lovely words and the information on life in the mountains. I particularly loved Lexie,the journalist daughter who tires of her writing jobs in a jiffy and constantly seeks something else to excite her. Somehow, the neighbors didn\u2019t make much of an impression on me and I wonder if it was done on purpose.Rosy\u2019s love for good food and the mountainside shows through the pages of the book.My only issue with the book was the length-400 odd pages.Somewhere in the middle the narrative sags a bit . I would have also wanted to learn more about the finer points of making tapestries.But things soon heat up and to know more you need to grab the book and read it :-).Let me leave you with one of the passages I particularly loved\u201cCatherine inhaled.It was the smell of the valley always had in snatches, the acidity of woodsmoke and behind it everywhere the darker, mellower scent of what had been there before the settlement of man.Earth and water and rock , and spent leaves returning to the earth.\u201dOverall, a simple love story set in a beautiful pastoral background. I\u2019ll give it a 3.5 /5. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good love story and am looking forward to reading more of her work."}, {"userName": "Misha  Mathew", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3809685-misha-mathew", "userReview": "Following her divorce, 48 years old Catherine Parkstone settles down in a tiny but picturesque French village in the C\u00e9vennes mountains. The story follows Catherine as she acquaints herself with the harsh and beautiful landscape, gets to know her neighbours and experiences a very different way of life from what she has been used to. She plans to set up a business in making tapestries. Catherine finds herself attracted to one particular neighbour, the mysterious Patrick Castagnol.The Tapestry of Love is the sort of book which you need to take in slowly. You need to savour each moment to feel its beauty. This is one of the best contemporary women's fiction I have read. I immersed myself into the beautiful imagery created by the author.The part that I enjoyed the most about the book were the beautiful descriptions of the French countryside. The setting comes alive in front of your eyes. I could imagine being there alongside Catherine as she explored a new culture and new people.If you are looking for a plot-driven novel , this might not be for you. There's no plot as such. It's more about Catherine's experience of the place and its people. If you don't like lots of details, this might not be for you again. However, I loved lingering in the details of the landscape. I love what the author is able to create with her words. I found myself transported to a different place.\"The sun had yet to climb its way above the crest of mountain over the house to the east, and the light was thin and pearly grey; by its pallid gleam Catherine could make out the hands of her watch showing a quarter to seven. Her eyes adjusted blurrily to the outside world. A hundred yards away, across the narrow gorge, lay a sheer wedge of grey black, crystalline rock and a tumble of vertiginoulsy clinging tress.\" (Page 7)\u201cIt was the view from her kitchen window, the view from the place at the table where she generally sat to work. She knew it so well now by all its lights and moods that she had no need to look up from her tapestry frame; on these quiet midnights she sat and worked from memory in front of the rectangle of black. In her emerging picture, it was morning: not first light but the soft luminosity of a breakfast time in spring, the sun breaking over the head of the valley to the left and outlining every leaf in gold.\u201d (Page 232)There is a feeling of tranquillity I got while reading the author's writing. It reminds me of lazy afternoons when you just want to immerse yourself in a good novel.I liked Catherine a lot. She's brave enough to move to an unfamiliar country on her own which shows how independent and spontaneous she is. Catherine comes across as a kind, thoughtful person, a caring mother and someone who can adapt to any situation. Despite a divorce, she's able to move on and find joy in the simple pleasures of life.The Tapestry of Love is a sweet and simple book about a woman finding love, living her life to the fullest, developing friendships and daring to live in her own terms. In the end, I had a dopey smile on my face and a warm gushy feeling inside. This is exactly the kind of non-stressful book I needed after a whole bunch serious and depressing books. I loved every moment of reading it!The vivid descriptions evoking such stunning visual imagery is what makes the book a memorable one for me. I am planning to read all of the author's books!Overall:Fantastic visual detailing and a loveable set of characters makes this book a great read.Recommended? Yes!

And I am really glad I did so! I find that my reading tastes have changed somehow over the years. Now I seem to appreciate older, mature, characters better. People who have lived and found themselves at a crossroads in life and people who have decided to start over. Since I am always saying to my other half that we should move to the country and find a simpler way of life this story could not have been more appropriate.Catherine Parkstone is a divorced Englishwoman with grown up children who has decided to pursue her dream of moving to a small French village - St. Julien in C\u00e9vennes \u2013 and start over. She cooks, plants some of her own food, meets her neighbours and decides to start a tapestry and upholstery business. I did like her a lot. She was cautious and reserved but after meeting her neighbour and seeing how... well... how neighbourly they are she opens up a bit and they develop an interesting relationship. There's a lot of caring and concern for one another as they are mostly older people seeing their village and way of life disappearing.Among the people that Catherine meets there's Patrick Castagnol, a somewhat mysterious man with whom she enjoys talking. She is getting settled in her new life and developing a tapestry business when her sister Bryony decides to come for a visit. Bryony seemed the total opposite of Catherine and I have to confess I did dislike her a bit. She is a workaholic attorney and although she apparently comes to find some time for herself and enjoy the same things that make Catherine happy, she doesn't even try to get to know the area and its people preferring to spend all her time romancing Castagnol and it seemed clear that a certain rivalry exists between the two.When Catherine is faced with her mother's death she goes back home and has to deal with all the emotions from that loss and also with the lives of her children, ex-husband and sister. She questions her decision to move to France to pursue an old dream and whether she should be closer to them. Life is not made of easy choices and I did like how the story dealt with family relationships. The story also includes a bit of romance that left me a bit worried for a while. Although I do not know the C\u00e9vennes area, I loved Rosy Thornton's description of the land and its people. I really could imagine how everything looked and it sounded like an area worth exploring. It seemed to suffer from the desertification so common, nowadays, to many European regions. That is unfortunate and I wonder if one day we will look back and realise that the huge mistake that was to let the little villages die by not providing jobs for the younger generation. As it is, I loved reading about St Julien and imagine myself walking down those roads not to mention eating all the food mentioned.For me this was a lovely read and it definitely left me with a taste to read more of the same. Should anyone have suggestions of books set in the country about new beginnings and getting to know a new culture feel free to send them my way!

The picture leaves the reader in no doubt that he/she is going to read about rural France. Yet for all my enthusiasm, it doesn\u2019t do the story justice.This is an outstanding read, pulling the reader straight into the C\u00e9vennes mountain region of France with such simplicity and effectiveness. The novel starts with the main character\u2019s car being stuck in a straggling flock of sheep which Catherine is not used to, making her imagine a flood in which her car may dislodge and \u201cbe swept downstream with the sheep\u201d. Just the next day she answers her cottage door (which I imagine to be the one on the cover) to a local farmer delivering a consignment of hay which Catherine has no idea what to do with. Rosy Thornton is brilliant at conveying scenes that the reader believes he/she is also living and therefore sharing, first-hand, the experiences of the characters.Catherine has no super-powers, she\u2019s not a powerful, beautiful heroine, yet I wanted her for my best friend. She\u2019s warm-hearted, with a quiet bravery that she plays down. She is generous and makes friends easily, melting the hearts of the \u201csuspicious of outsiders\u201d locals. Soon she becomes part of the community and even manages to cope with the excessive bureaucracy without pulling her hair out.This is a warm, inviting book, even though the love-attraction is flawed (albeit handsome and in many ways appealing) with secrets only revealed towards the end.The array of characters have their individual foibles: there\u2019s the selfish sister, the very funny daughter who can\u2019t settle and the quiet, studious son. And that\u2019s not counting the colourful local characters who have to face their own problems. No-one can accuse this novel of being boring or repetitive.But Rosy Thornton is a master of description. She brings the story alive, either through the pelting weather: \u201cthrough the descending curtain of gray she could make out the gate at the end of his yard\u201d or through the markets heaving under their selections of fruit and vegetables: \u201cfat, blanched leeks (and) butter beans for drying, their creamy pods stippled with purple\u201d. She sees the countryside as an artist, \u201cthe sky was a luminous mauve\u2026giving the illusion that road and rocks and vegetation were illuminated from some hidden source, like ethereal stage lighting\u201d.And it doesn\u2019t end there. If we can feel and see the story, we can also taste it. This is the world of thick green soup, of dates and bacon, of wild mushrooms on toast, of wild boar and venison, and a scrumptious Mirabelle tart.I was so enthralled, I didn\u2019t want the book to end. It certainly is a page-turner, but I savoured it, restricting myself to just a few pages per day because I knew that when I finished it, I\u2019d feel I\u2019d lost a friend.

Go on a cross-country adventure, write a novel, ride the space shuttle (Ok that last one is just me). In The Tapestry of Love by Rosy Thornton the lead character, Catherine Parkstone, is leaving her comfortable life in England behind. A life where her children Tom and Lexie are grown and out of the house. Tom is living his life working and camping with his girlfriend. Lexie wonders ever other day if she should quit her job. Catherine is divorced from their father, and is now ready to live her own life.Living her own life leads to a remote town on the French countryside. She isn't fully fluent in French and doesn't know anyone in town. Sound like a great idea? I don't know. It sounds kind of isolating. Who do you turn to? What do you do when you get homesick? Do you pack up and leave? Why am I here? Catherine faces all of those emotions.Eventually she does adapt to the town and the town adapts to her. She finds friends in an elderly couple, who often try to feed her and ply her with tea at every turn. Catherine isn't sure when to say yes or no to their kindness. Will they think she is rude? Will they think I'm too English?She starts her own business as seamstress, which is slow going at the start but soon flourishes. One person in particular, her neighbor Patrick, is intriguing. They can talk to each other easily about food, books and life. There is a chemistry there, but it's a chemistry that Catherine tries to deny herself. Reading between the lines, Patrick clearly wants a relationship with Catherine but she is reluctant. In my opinion, Catherine felt like she didn't deserve to be happy again. She had her chance in her first marriage, it's not worth it to try again. Who needs the complications of a relationship? When her sister, Bryony, visits and begins a relationship with Patrick, Catherine chooses to suffer in silence. Why? Why? Just open your mouth, he is right there.This is a very sweet book. The descriptions of the food, wine, and scenery make me want to visit the French countryside now. But I would probably have to brush up on my French. There are no complicated plots in this book. It's just about a woman trying to navigate the second half of her life, which is something a lot of people can relate to.

I needn't have worried though, because I thoroughly enjoyed it! I admit that I had previously been unfamiliar with Rosy Thornton and her books, but now that I've been enlightened I would definitely like to read more of her work.The Tapestry of Love is the story of Catherine Parkstone, a forty-eight year old divorced woman who decides to sell her home in England and buy a cottage in the mountainous C\u00e9vennes region of France. Catherine intends to start her own business providing home furnishings for her neighbours, but unfortunately things don't go quite according to plan. And her life becomes even more complicated when her sister Bryony arrives on a three month sabbatical!Although the book has a quiet, gentle tone, the plot was interesting enough to hold my attention from beginning to end. There were enough moments of drama to keep the story moving along and some humourous scenes too \u2013 for example, Catherine's telephone conversations with her daughter Lexie, an aspiring journalist who is feeling increasingly disillusioned with her job at a cake-decorating magazine.I particularly enjoyed reading about all the little details of Catherine's new life: gardening, cooking, beekeeping, shopping at the market. The real highlight of this book though, is the sense of community: when Catherine first arrives in La Grelaudiere she is a stranger, an outsider, but over time she begins to gain the trust and respect of her neighbours and starts to forge some real friendships. We get to know Monsieur Bouschet and his wife; the reclusive Guillaume; the elderly widow Madame Volpiliere and the enigmatic Patrick Castagnol. The author skilfully brings the characters to life and makes them feel completely realistic.I've never been to the C\u00e9vennes, but the mountains, remote hamlets and picturesque villages are described so vividly I could easily build a picture of the area in my mind. While I don't think I'd be brave enough to do what Catherine did and leave my home and family to move there all on my own, it does seem like a beautiful and peaceful place to live, the kind of place you could easily fall in love with.I very much enjoyed spending time in the mountains with Catherine and her neighbours. If you're interested in France, needlework, nature or good food, or if you're simply looking for an absorbing and well-written story with likeable, believable characters, you should find plenty here to keep you happy."}, {"userName": "Best Crime Books & More", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10323950-best-crime-books-more", "userReview": "Okay, firstly I have to say that I am usually of the \u2018trashier the better\u2019 kind of attitude. If I am reading Chick Lit, I love the sleaze and glamour of it all. On the other side of the fence, I love a good crime thriller where we see the regular cop heroes turn up at every given opportunity. However, this book certainly doesn\u2019t fit into the Chick Lit genre and I would be at a loss as to where to place it. It is a \u2018real\u2019 book, that\u2019s the best way I can describe it. There is no gush, no fairytale typical storylines, and certainly no murders!Rosy Thornton has managed to produce a book that doesn\u2019t just tell you a story; it parks your butt on a plane and actually takes you there. Her style of writing is unusual in comparison to what I am used to but it is brilliant all the same. I could almost imagine myself sitting in the corner of Catherin Parkstone\u2019s kitchen in the Cevennes Mountains and actually watching her life unfold. The characters are written really well and there is such an element of realism that you find yourself swept along with the tale. The scenery is so well described that it has left a vivid picture in my imagination of what everything and everybody should look like.The story itself was great too and we meet Catherine\u2019s local neighbours, who are at first very \u2018French\u2019, making Catherine have to work a lot harder to become part of the community. Catherine\u2019s sister Bryony makes an appearance in Cevennes after making a radical decision to take a sabbatical from work. This complicates Catherine\u2019s life more than she cares to admit. She struggles to get her priorities in her head the right way round. Although both her children are grown up she finds herself constantly worrying about whether they will be okay and whether moving to this remote part of France was a good idea after all. The book is structured so that we see her time at her home progress over a number of months which makes it so much easier to imagine the different times of year in this area. It also gives the reader the element of how far she has come and what the future will hold.All in all this was a fantastic book. I will admit that I would never have chosen this from a bookstore as it doesn\u2019t look trashy enough for me, but boy am I glad I read this. A wonderful book with a real touch of realism that is perfect for curling up with. I would highly recommend this book and Rosy Thornton will definitely be added to my list of authors to pre-order from."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3086082-michelle", "userReview": "Some stories start out strong, capturing a reader\u2019s attention from the first few pages, while others build slowly, taking their time to weave a story through detailed descriptions and careful character development. As one could guess from its title, The Tapestry of Love is very much one of the latter types of stories. Rosy Thornton\u2019s deliberate layering of setting and character create a languid story that is as French in its meandering as it is in its set location. Do not let this description fool you however; The Tapestry of Love is a powerful story of reawakening and a coming-of-age story for the over-forty crowd.Catherine is a bit of a conundrum. She arrives in France completely affected by the eight years since her divorce, but the reader does not get any insight into these experiences. Instead, one gets the chance to understand Catherine and her motivations slowly, through hints and glimpses into the past. This makes Catherine a difficult character to understand at first because very few people can relate to her need to move to a foreign country and surround herself with the silence of the countryside, let alone her tapestry business. However, as the reader gathers a more complete picture of her, the story, and the reader's empathy for Catherine, takes off.Reminiscent of stories by authors like D. H. Lawrence or Thomas Hardy, the setting is as much a character as Catherine or Patrick is. Catherine\u2019s entire growth occurs because of her house and her experiences in France versus in England. Ms. Thornton captures the ambiance and flavor of C\u00e9vennes with her lush descriptions and painstaking detail. In fact, she builds the setting color by color, just like Catherine builds her tapestries. The tie-in is brilliant and effective.The Tapestry of Love is a simple and beautiful story told in an old-fashioned, meandering way that is perfect for the idyllic backdrop. Completely the opposite of today's more popular conspiracy thrillers or sappy romantic tragedies, it is one of those novels that all but requires a cuppa while reading. More importantly, it is meant to be savored slowly, read while enjoying a quiet afternoon or two; pauses for daydreams or naps while reading are completely allowed. The Tapestry of Love provides a great relaxing escape from the mundaneness of everyday life."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97631-jessica", "userReview": "I received this book for free from the publisher. All content and opinions are my own.When Rosy Thornton recently emailed me and asked if I would like a copy of her latest book, The Tapestry of Love, I immediately said yes! I've heard such wonderful things about her other books, especially Crossed Wires, but I've never been able to find copies. So, when The Tapestry of Love arrived, courtesy of Her Majesty's postal service, I dove right in. Here's the blurb on the back:A rural idyll: that's what Catherine is seeking when she sells her house in England and moves to a tiny hamlet in the Cevennes mountains [in the south of France]. With her divorce in the past and her children grown, she is free to make a new start, and to set up in business as a seamstress. But this is a harsh and lonely place when you're no longer here on holiday. There is French bureaucracy to contend with, not to mention the mountain weather, and the reserve of her neighbours, including the intriguing Patrick Castagnol. And that's before the arrival of Catherine's sister, Bryony...Let me say first that Thornton's writing is splendid.\u00a0 It's poetic and expressive without calling undue attention to itself.\u00a0 It was a joy to read the words themselves, but the best part of the book for me was the character development.\u00a0 Catherine and her English family and French neighbors constitute a cast that I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know.\u00a0 I wanted to spend more time with each of them.\u00a0 The Tapestry of Love is a rare, unhurried, character-driven work to curl up with for a leisurely read in any kind of weather. However, Tapestry wasn't perfectly woven.\u00a0 The plot meandered at times, and some of the plot devices, particularly at the end, were convenient.\u00a0 And one plot point with Catherine\u2019s sister Bryony that had me a bit baffled.\u00a0 But, I was more than willing to forgive a spot of prosaic plot for great writing and interesting characters.\u00a0 Tapestry is sweet and subtle, and I didn't want it to end.I\u2019ll definitely be checking out more works by Rosy Thornton."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3363731-tiffany", "userReview": "Reviewed for BookPleasures.com & A Cozy Reader's Corner ReviewsWith her children grown, her divorce behind her and her future ahead, Catherine is ready for a fresh start. With a plan and a dream of a new life, Catherine leaves England to move to the rural and idyllic French town in the Cevennes Mountains. Her dream of starting her own tapestry business is in her sights. Though Catherine has fond memories of the holidays she once spent in these French mountains, she soon discovers not everything is as idyllic as she hoped it would be. As Catherine deals with loneliness, dreary weather and the French bureaucracy, she finds friendship, love and a new outlook. When Catherine\u2019s sister Bryony arrives Catherine realizes everything has only just begun.The Tapestry of love can only be described as a soulful and descriptive journey. The novel chronicles a year in Catherine\u2019s life as she moves from England to France in hopes of a quiet and idyllic life. She has personal dreams of starting a tapestry business and becomes quite successful. Unfortunately life cannot be idyllic all the time. Catherine learns to find peace and comfort with new neighbors and friends in times of turmoil.The author is a skilled writer. Her descriptive nature left nothing to the imagination. I was able to clearly envision the town, mountain landscape, characters and everything else this novel had to offer. The pace likewise was measured. It fit the idyllic community perfectly while all of this is a charming aspect of the novel it also took away from the book for me. I found that due to the measured pace, I was able to put this book down far to often for my own preference. I also was not compelled to pick it back up quickly, though I did enjoy the story.Overall, this is a relaxed read. Nothing about the novel is rushed. The story is wonderful, yet I would have preferred less description and more story. While the ending works, I was interested in more than what it gave. I felt that if the story hadn\u2019t seemingly paused as often as it did that I could have learned much more about all the characters rather than feeling a surface relationship. The title would be a great rainy day read or garden read for those who enjoy reading outdoors."}], "description": "A warm and uplifting story of how a woman falls in love with a place and its people: a landscape, a community and a fragile way of life.A rural idyll: that's what Catherine is seeking when she sells her house in England and moves to a tiny hamlet in the C\u00e9vennes mountains.
