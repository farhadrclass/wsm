This, the chronological first of the Gus & Call stories, is a surprisingly harsh and brutal series of expeditions in the Southwest, usually involving hostile Mexicans, Apache and/or Comanche. The titular stretch of hostile ground in modern-day New Mexico is so fucking desolate and uninhabitable that it was even used for the Trinity atomic bomb test in 1945! The aforementioned expeditions range from a really dumb, abortive attempt to capture Santa Fe to simple \"Indian fighting\", usually involving lots of tracking and extended chases on horseback.So based off of that knowledge I did expect some typically western rough times...but christ. It seemed like McMurtry was going for his own personal Blood Meridian at times. I've only seen the (insanely good) movie adaptation of Lonesome Dove, and I assume they cut out some violent content on that one--but there's no way that characters were getting scalped and unceremoniously emasculated right and left like in this novel. It was kind of a bummer, because I was trying to read something a little lighter and easier than the usual morbid fare I enjoy and then within like 3 pages Buffalo Hump is carving some guy's cock and balls off and then running around with his corpse flopping bloodlessly on the back of his horse. So yeah, I didn't get that nice vacation-book I was looking for.Despite the lack of a focused, concise plot this was still an enjoyable book. It's really about the characters and how they interact in this kind of wasteland setting rather than momentous events and that kind of thing. And McMurtry does characters very well! There are several memorable and likable characters here other than Gus & Call. Some of the characters are obvious redshirts for the unending combination of hunger, thirst and hostile humans to dramatically kill off, but others are genuinely good inventions on the author's part. I especially liked Matilda (a prostitute colloquially called the Great Western) and had a genuine investment in her fate. Buffalo Hump was a great villain, which brings me to a minor quibble...and not even one with the book, though.I really don't get some of the reviews calling this book racist when it comes to the native characters--why the FUCK would they not be hostile and savagely violent towards the protagonists? These are not normal, village-dwelling natives, these are brutal and ruthless warriors that live outside of normal native society and make their living off of slavery and looting. The white characters that live the same life are equally violent and remorseless--I don't remember their names, but the two white slavers in the book were a couple of the most vile characters in it. It's honestly more racist to say that native peoples like the Apache and Comanche weren't capable and often inclined to this kind of thing--humans in every group on earth have people that act like this.So not a terribly well-rounded experience, and not one I loved--but one I definitely did like. As always, Gus & Call are a fictional duo for the ages and their banter and friendship is constantly rewarding. The details of western life are all there as well for those who like that kind of thing (I'm assuming most readers of westerns.) But ultimately this novel was almost exactly like its setting for me--brutal, sometimes monochromatic and often too dry. I'll continue on with Comanche Moon soon and look forward to it, but I'm also hoping for something I can sink my teeth into a little more comfortably next time."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5871845-jon", "userReview": "While it was great to read about Gus and Call again - two of literature's more vivid characters - there seemed to be little point to DEAD MAN'S WALK other than \"here's some more Gus & Call.\" While LONESOME DOVE contains not only great characters and stirring developments, but also meditates on themes of change, age and regret, here McMurtry seems content to just revisit his two leads and kick them around the old west for a few hundred pages. Most disappointingly, in this novel Gus and Call are passive characters - primarily bystanders in their own adventure. It seems the only reason they survive while others don't is that they need to be around for LONESOME DOVE in 30 years or so. They don't even really arc, and the novel ends with the two pretty much back where they started, presumably a little wiser but without having done anything of note (other than being lucky) or having grown in any discernible way. While it's understandable that the novel starts them out as naive, tentative protagonists, it barely advances them. They even remain quiet observers even through the unusual climax, such that an inactive resolution can be referred to as \"climactic.\" I suspect this whole endeavor is largely prelude to COMANCHE MOON, which hopefully contains a more satisfying resolution. At the very least, I hope it contains a resolution. McMurtry's prose is easy on the eyes, and he does have a great facility for language and observation, particularly when filtered through Gus. But this book is a pale shadow of LONESOME DOVE."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381899-dan", "userReview": "My review for those who do not want to read this book:Hungry, thirsty, lost, hungry, thirsty, lost, hungry, thirsty, Comanches, hungry, thirsty, lost, hungry, thirsty, Mexicans, hungry, thirsty, walking, hungry, thirsty, walking.My Review for those who may:This book, while entertaining, is rather repetitive. I'm not sure how entertaining it would be without having read Lonesome Dove first (a clearly superior novel). Strangely, both Gus and Call are bystanders rather than protagonists in this novel. McMurtry does give us what we want though, the genesis of Gus and Call's friendship and adventures. He just doesn't involve them in any significant way, which is a bit of a let down. Part IV is also a bit odd as there is a POV shift for half of the remaining 7 chapters. We are now seeing some events through the Comanche's eyes, and once from the perspective of a slave trader. I wonder why the change after 440 pages?I am assuming that Comanche Moon is the volume where Gus and Call do a lot of the growing up and killing to get them to the point where we meet them in Lonesome Dove (which is set about 30 years later)."}, {"userName": "Carol Storm", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm", "userReview": "I really loved this \"prequel\" to the Western Classic LONESOME DOVE. In this story, Texas Rangers Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae are not seasoned veterans in the Wild West of the 1870's when the buffalo herds are gone and the Indian tribes nearly vanished. Instead they are boys in their teens, inhabiting a post-Alamo Texas where buffalo herds number in the millions and raiders of the mighty Comanche tribe can appear anywhere and inflict sudden death and unspeakable torture at any moment. You might think that this novel would be less dark and less poignant than LONESOME DOVE, just because the two main characters are young and carefree, and because readers obviously know that they won't be killed (since they have to grow up and become legends in another book.) But McMurtry is able to show so much terror and horror on the frontier, with boys the same age as the heroes meeting horrible death in the most unexpected ways. The suspense of the first Ranger patrol is almost unbearable, especially when Gus wanders off guard one stormy night and nearly walks right into the camp of legendary Comanche chief Buffalo Hump!It's very exciting to read this book, but sometimes frustrating, because the most interesting characters tend to lurk in the shadows. This story fills in more details about Buffalo Hump, explaining how he came to father the devious, indestructible devil-child who will become Blue Duck. We also meet a colorful band of Comanche warriors who have never yet known defeat, including the crafty and cruel horse-thief Kicking Wolf, who tortures with great skill but remains a strangely admirable character. The only flaw in this book is that there aren't enough Comanches, and that the females they interact with are only ever portrayed as voiceless, faceless victims. By the same token, the white women in the book are all sentimentalized to some degree. Either they're rugged, uncomplaining, good-hearted whores, like Matilda \"The Great Northern\" who exists only to proves that she's a pal over and over, or they're sickeningly sweet ingenues like Clara Forsythe. Personally, I would have loved to see a lot more about Rosa among the Comanches, and a lot less about Clara keeping store. But that's just me! Overall this book is a near-classic, sure to please any Western fan."}, {"userName": "Bob Mayer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4460714-bob-mayer", "userReview": "Lonesome Dove is one of my favorite books of all time. And a rare case where the casting of the mini-series was PERFECT. I've re-read the book several times.Dead Man's Walk precedes Lonesome Dove timewise. We meet many of the characters when they are younger. While not as good as LD, it's still a great read.The long walk across Texas is fascinating. I've driven it in my Jeep, I was so interested in it. Larry McMurtry is a master writer who has written a wide spectrum of books.

What a stinkeroo this turned out to be. In fact, it sadly confirms the suspicions I had of McMurtry while reading Lonesome Dove which is to say he has incredible skill in drawing you into a rich, realistic, dusty Old West atmosphere but lacks the ability to create a well-structured story. Also, contrary to popular opinion, I feel McMurtry -- at least in his Western novels -- paints some pretty one-dimensional characters.This book triples the meandering of Lonesome Dove, which incidentally I really loved but for different reasons. Dead Man's Walk forms the first of two prequels to Lonesome Dove (the other being Commanche Moon) and attempts to build a solid back story to our two macho heros Gus and Woodrow. Lots of tension, to be sure. Tons of violence? You bet. Grisly, sadistic (and mostly unnecessary) torture? Yep. Not much point for being? Unfortunately, yes.I slogged through Commanche Moon after this book but now, after reading three out of the four Lonesome Dove books, I have to admit defeat and leave Streets of Laredo (the series' last book, chronologically speaking) untouched. Probably just as well as that book is frequently talked about as the worst of the bunch."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah", "userReview": "This was the weakest of the series so far but it was still a good book. It was great to see Call and Gus when they were green and fumbling and it was great to see Gus meet Clara. Still, it didn't have the colorful characters that I loved so much in Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo. I was actually wondering if he wrote most of this as a background before he even wrote Lonesome Dove just because it was so much less entertaining."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "Some years ago, my friend Tressa finally convinced me to read a western and that book was Lonesome Dove. It is now one of my favorite books of all time. Recently, I signed up for Audible, (to get a free audiobook, if I'm to be completely honest), and when I went to cancel the trial, they convinced me to stay on for a reduced price.I agreed to it and immediately went book shopping. Thanks to my lovely GR and BL friends, (mostly I'm looking at you Bark and Spare Ammo), I stumbled upon and recognized the name Will Patton. The book was Dead Man's Walk and featured my two favorite characters from Lonesome Dove. I downloaded this bad boy and I was hooked! Sometimes in a sequel, (which in this case is actually a prequel), the story isn't as good, or the characters aren't as compelling, but I didn't find any of that to be the case. Plus, this tale had the added enhancement of Will Patton's wonderful voicing and narration. Gus and Call are young and just getting to know each other in this story and it was kind of neat to see how they got together. Gus and Call, among over 200 other men, are forced on a 200 mile march across Mexico, through an area called the Dead Man's Walk. Here, this book becomes much bloodier than Lonesome Dove was.The death toll is extremely high. Instead of Blue Duck, this time around we have Buffalo Hump and a ghostly Apache named Gomez. Not to mention the even worse white men, pirate turned \"colonel\" Caleb Cobb and the French Major LaRoche. With Will Patton's voice adding both humor and horror throughout, I had a fine time listening to this book. I was disappointed to learn that he does not narrate the other books in this series. Which, despite how much I love the stories, discourages me from listening to them. I just can't see how anyone else could live up to this performance. I will probably read them instead.Lastly, a warning to those that are easily offended. This book is populated with all kinds of stuff that is not politically correct. There are whores and lots of them, there are all kinds of names and terms that were used at the time that are not commonly used or accepted now. If that kind of thing bothers you, you should probably take a pass. In this context, it did not bother me. I loved listening to Dead Man's Walk, and I am already looking forward to listening to it again in the future. The story isn't perfect, and perhaps it's a bit too bloody, even for me, but I loved it anyway and I learned some things. (Mostly that I love Will Patton's voice, but other things as well.) If you enjoyed Lonesome Dove, I believe that you'll enjoy this book too. And if you can get it with Will Patton's narration, you really can't go wrong.Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Twerking To Beethoven", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8940772-twerking-to-beethoven", "userReview": "To be perfectly candid, the only reason I picked this book up is...

That being said, I know I'm supposed to type something else and give out further details about this book BUT, given there are some sweet reviews out there, and I'm not so good when it comes to reviews since I'm way better at being either a spoiling or a slacking bastard, I'll just let you go through what other people have to say about it.

McMurtry turns a guilty pleasure genre into a rich, capital-L Literary experience. Though the thorough characterization in Lonesome Dove is somewhat substituted by a heavier focus on plot development, McMurtry's writing still shines; he is a master storyteller, always in complete control of what he's doing.Here's just a single teaser for the plot: it's loosely based on the ludicrously planned and executed Texas Santa Fe Expedition.Sidenote: If you're wondering where to start in the Lonesome Dove tetralogy, start with Lonesome Dove, ya dummy!

At first I had a little difficulty separating the two main characters in my mind -- Woodrow Call and Gus McRae -- but then that is because both were so callow at the outset. The short portraits of the Apache Gomez and the Comanches Buffalo Hump and Kicking Wolf were superbly drawn. I also liked the characterization of the Mexican officer who captures the Texas Rangers \"invasion force.\" He grows from being a hateful martinet to a sympathetic character in a terrible position -- because of the inane and impossible orders he was given.

On their first ride out to survey a new road, they meet up with Buffalo Hump, one of the fiercest Comanche warriors on the plains. They lose two men, and are lucky to make it back safely to San Antonio.On their next adventure, the troop heads out for Santa Fe, New Mexico \u2013 over a thousand miles away! They meet up with a tornado. Gus falls in love with practically every woman he sees. Gus loves to embellish his stories with outright fibs. Call has a cooler head and thinks Gus is more than a little lazy and spends too much time whoring and drinking. Call intends to save his money for better weapons. They finally get to the meeting place for this expedition and meet Caleb Cobb and his sidekick Billy Falconer. Caleb is not as Gus presented him and Billy is mean. Along for the ride is General Lloyd. He is a drunk and so out of it that he cannot ride his own horse, so he rides in a wagon. Riding through the plains, Call had plenty of time to think about getting lost. The desolate countryside was daunting. The reader has to remember that there were no streetlights and no guardrails to help them along their way. There was nothing but blackness and the fear of losing one\u2019s way at night. The fear of Indians and a horse going lame was another consideration. I simply wouldn\u2019t have made it. I\u2019m not tough enough. All of their little party is shocked when Caleb Cobb invites Buffalo Hump into camp to eat and parley. The men absolutely hate him and want to kill him. But they stay their feelings during the meeting. When Caleb wants to give Buffalo Hump Billy Falconer\u2019s fine Holland and Holland rifle as a present, Falconer balks and threatens to quit. Cobb \u201cresigns\u201d Falconer and gives the rifle to Buffalo Hump who rides off without another word.Later the Comanche set fire to the plains from three directions when the soldiers have their backs to a steep and deep canyon. Caleb Cobb dithers and the men just have time to leap over the edge of the canyon in order to save themselves. Several men die in the attempt and the horses run off. When the fire dies down, the men find themselves afoot with no food and very little water. The desert is unforgiving. Call, Gus and Bigfoot are captured by the Mexican army. They are shackled and walking across the plains when the little camp was attacked by a grizzly. It scattered the frightened Mexicans, killed Captain Salazar\u2019s horse and ran rampant through the camp. Call, Gus and Bigfoot got away and were lucky enough to find Caleb Cobb and a diminished troop of men. They marched without food or water for a while and were met by the Mexican army \u2013 hundreds of men, mounted soldiers and cannon. Captured once again, Caleb Cobb surrenders. Call is absolutely furious with Cobb. They are escorted and on their way to Mexico City over a thousand miles away. The problem is that they have to cross an area called the dead man\u2019s walk. Through sleet, bitter cold and without much food or water they march on. Then handed off to a humorless major and his soldiers for the remainder of their walk, they are told to bathe in the Rio Grande. It is very cold. Some of the younger of the Texans panic and start to flee. The Mexican soldiers run rampant on them, killing several despite the major\u2019s yelling at them to stop, and Bigfoot as well yelling at the Texans. When they get to the little town which is surrounded by feral dogs, they are told to pick blindfolded from a jar of beans. There are ten men left \u2013 and Mattie- and if they pick a white bean they will live. If they pick a black bean, they will be shot. Gus and Call make it and then they meet a Scottish Lady Carey and her Viscount son Willy. The Lady has leprosy, but her son and maids do not. She proposes to the five men that they take her to Galveston. Since they are now housed in a leper colony and there are no soldiers about, they decide to go.What follows is perhaps the most amusing and inexplicable journey yet. It is brilliant. What a good novel this is. Across the plains of Texas and New Mexico and down the Dead Man\u2019s Walk, Gus and Call manage to survive against all odds. It is a harrowing and scary journey of several thousand miles.

I don't regret it.This is chronologically the first book about Gus and Woodrow, when they are not yet 20, and have just joined the Texas Rangers. It is a violent story, but the violence is tempered by so many human emotions that it never comes off as gratuitous. The characters, even the minor ones, seem like living people.Who lives and who dies is sometimes completely arbitrary. There is one important character who dies and his death is just a shockingly stupid thing. I thought he would make it to the end, that nothing short of a grizzly or at least the fierce Buffalo Hump Comanche chief would take him out. Not the case.One issue I do have, though, is with Gus and his whoring. Yes, he was a whoremonger in Lonesome Dove. That is the case here, too. How did somebody so frisky for whores manage to live so long in that time period without dying of some STD?That aside, I completely enjoyed Dead Man's Walk and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good Western with plenty of action built around character development, or anyone who just wants a good story and can handle reading about fights, torture, scalping, etc."}, {"userName": "Keli Wright", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/698761-keli-wright", "userReview": "I just finished \"Dead Man's Walk\" by Larry McMurtry It was written after \"Lonesome Dove\" but chronologically came before so I read it first when I was dating Mitch we talked about me reading some westerns so I had all ready bought this one and I finally got around to reading it...

Another interesting thing is that I have heard several stories of the old west from the Native American point of view but interestingly enough never the cowboy.. very interesting reading it from the cowboy point of view...I would reccommend this book if you can stomach prime-time TV it is cleaner than that and does get good:)"}, {"userName": "Molly Jae", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2409582-molly-jae", "userReview": "Ahh, this is a great cowboy story. It's the first time I've ever read McMurtry who has written over 30 books, and I'm excited to read more. Dead Man's Walk is the first in a tetrology which includes the Pulitzer Prize winning Lonesome Dove. I think his writing flows beautifully, his dialogue is great and you can smell the sagebrush and taste the dry sand as he describes the West. I imagine that his story reflects some truth of how the West was explored which means it is not a light-hearted story. I was fearful of the Comanche Chief Buffalo Hump from his first introduction to the final scene. I can't imagine ever having the courage to cross the plains after hearing the stories of the Comanches and Apaches. It paints a picture of men (and a few women) who were courageous, adventuresome, careless and perhaps carefree enough to risk life and limb to the unknown. My favorite part of the book begins in the leper colony of San Lazaro, where a black or white bean determines the fate of the 10 remaining cowboys and continues to the final scene of Gus and Call helping a leper women on her journey home to England and have the ultimate face-off with Chief Buffalo Hump.I would recommend this book to: Vaughn, Rex, Jay, Clark, Jerry, Darren, Dad, Uncle John and all other cowboys."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4432628-kyle", "userReview": "Dead Man's Walk is the first book in the Lonesome Dove series, and features three beloved characters -- Woodrow Call, Augustus McCrae, and Clara. If you enjoyed Lonesome Dove, don't expect to find awe inspiring younger versions of Call and McCrae in this story. Call and McCrae do not posesses great marksmanship, horsemanship, or tracking skills, they are not gifted with the ability to quickly learn Spanish, Apache, and Commanche, and they do not have great insights into the minds of Indians. The two things they do have are luck and endurance, and these two things allow them to survive where other men died. You can see how Call at least recognizes his deficiences, and wants to improve his Western skills. I enjoyed watching the two of them endure extreme hardships, and near brushes with death, all of which shaped them into the hardened men they would become in Lonesome Dove.Warning! There are numerous scenes where Commance warriors particiapte in grisly things such as taking scalps and torturing prisoners. The West was not an easy place in the 1840's, and McMurty doesn't shy away from bloodshed and tragedy."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2414689-mary", "userReview": "While not as good as Lonesome Dove, I still enjoyed this book (this is actually the 2nd or 3rd time I've read it). I love the characters of Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call who were first introduced in Lonesome Dove. Dead Man's Walk is one of two prequels to Lonesome Dove. Here we see Gus and Woodrow beginning their careers as Texas Rangers. Their adventures in this book will leave the reader exhausted by the end. There are some very gruesome scenes, but there are also moments of levity provided mainly by amusing dialogue and McMurtry's trademark quirky characters. For some reason, this is one of my favorite exchanges in the book:Gus: They say an Indian can imitate any sound. They can fool you into thinking they're a wolf or a coyote or an owl or a cricket.Woodrow: I doubt a Comanche would pretend to be a cricket.That exchange right there nearly sums up the two men's personalities (Gus has flighty, romantic notions and Woodrow is maddeningly literal and practical). Now on to their second adventure: Comanche Moon."}, {"userName": "Kaye Stambaugh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2514372-kaye-stambaugh", "userReview": "I'd recently reread Lonesome Dove, one of my all-time favorite books, and wasn't ready to let go of the characters. Dead Man's Walk is a prequel with Gus and Call as 19-20 year olds, anxious to be Texas Rangers. I really liked the book BECAUSE I already loved these two characters. McMurtry made clear why Gus and Call were so loyal to one another later in life, and we meet a young Clara, who I fell in love with, right along with Gus. As in Lonesome Dove, the boys take a long journey filled with hardships. The story contains one of the more unique escapes from murderous Comanches that you'll ever read! A good story for Lonesome Dove fans."}, {"userName": "Matt Cline", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3605577-matt-cline", "userReview": "I agree with other reviewers that the characters are relatively one-dimensional and the story is weaker here than in Lonesome Dove or Streets of Laredo, but found McMurtry's easy and whimsical prose satisfying nonetheless. With this third novel in the series, Call begins to rise above Gus as the overall protagonist. Curious to see how the two main characters will be treated in the finale, Comanche Moon. I suspect also (or at least hope) that the story will arc from Dead Man's Walk such that, taking the two prequels together, character development and story will grow into true rivals of the other two books in the tetralogy, each tremendous and easy five-star rating recipients."}, {"userName": "Scott Axsom", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7099104-scott-axsom", "userReview": "Another rollicking McMurtry Western, the first (chronologically) of the Lonesome Dove series. A fun, easy read with maybe a little less allegory than I'd have preferred but what it contains is quite good. Excellent back-story work regarding Gus and Woodrow - quite delicious, that. Would've been 4 stars, if he'd shaved about a hundred pages off of it - got a little unwieldy toward the end and he had to bring in a deus ex machina to wrangle it all into the corral. Still, all-in-all, a wonderful book."}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2846441-karla", "userReview": "This was a letdown from the masterpiece that is Lonesome Dove. The story didn't gel together that well, and the characters weren't nearly as well-drawn. I got a \"franchise\" feel from it, like it was just being written to give the fans more Gus & McCall stories, or simply to cash in.The opera singer's ploy to pass through the gauntlet was absurd. It's really the only thing I remember vividly about it."}], "description": "Dead Man's Walk is the first, extraordinary book in the epic Lonesome Dove tetralogy, in which Larry McMurtry breathed new life into the vanished American West and created two of the most memorable heroes in contemporary fiction: Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call. As young Texas Rangers, Gus and Call have much to learn about survival in a land fraught with perils: not only the blazing heat and raging tornadoes, roiling rivers and merciless Indians but also the deadly whims of soldiers. On their first expeditions--led by incompetent officers and accompanied by the robust, dauntless whore known as the Great Western--they will face death at the hands of the cunning Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump and the silent Apache Gomez. They will be astonished by the Mexican army. And Gus will meet the love of his life.", "title": "Dead Man's Walk\n      \n          (Lonesome Dove #3)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54804.Dead_Man_s_Walk", "average": 3.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1371294566l/54804.jpg", "reviews": 469, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1055.Larry_McMurtry", "name": "Larry McMurtry"}], "type": ["Westerns", "Fiction", "Historical", "Historical", "Adventure"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54804.Dead_Man_s_Walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1122416.Dead_Man_s_Walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24914205-dead-man-s-walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8453005-dead-man-s-walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20767358-dead-man-s-walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2917169-dead-man-s-walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/536826.Dead_Man_s_Walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8486138-dead-man-s-walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1179419.Dead_Man_s_Walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256008.Lonesome_Dove", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63461.Terms_of_Endearment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50051.The_Last_Picture_Show", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54812.Streets_of_Laredo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54807.Comanche_Moon"]}
