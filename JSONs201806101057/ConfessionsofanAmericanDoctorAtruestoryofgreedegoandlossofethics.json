The author is not a career criminal, but rather a highly qualified and respected doctor with several degrees and a PHD. This is his story of how his desire to become rich and famous backfired and affected his family, his livelihood and his reputation.Well written and unapologetic in its style, Max details his background and how he came to work in the medical field. Despite being anything but naive, he is soon drawn into the illicit world of human growth hormone importation, an illegal practice very much in the public eye during the early noughties. Following his arrest and the subsequent investigation, the author is refreshingly honest in his descriptions of his struggle with anxiety and of trying to maintain a healthy father daughter relationship with his young child. I would have liked to have read a little more of what happened after, perhaps an epilogue would have sufficed. I want to know - where is he now? An interesting and thought provoking tale of egotism and a catastrophic fall from grace."}, {"userName": "Janice Richardson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52538483-janice-richardson", "userReview": "This man made a mistake. We all make mistakes. This doctor made choices. We all make choices. He had a difficult upbringing. Many of have had difficult childhoods, similar or worse.Driven to succeed, he made a decision, a choice to ignore the warning signs and stop signs that made his activity illegal. Greed was the driver. Money was his motivation. With blinders on, he barreled into a felony charge.He struggled to understand and explain why he did what he did, he also did accept responsibility for his actions. He wasn't helping people, he was helping himself get rich. Arrested and charged with a felony, he crashed. Redemption and pardon weren't possible, he could not buy that. Humiliated and ashamed, he was honest with the authorities and eventually he worked on becoming honest with himself. He learned to face his shortcomings. I liked this book. Nobody is perfect. Some of us just fall a little further than others. Hitting bottom can become the beginning of redemption and peace. It's part of growing up.The Hippocratic Oath states - 'I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm.' Unfortunately, he chose to risk his patients lives with unregulated drugs. No one died, but they could have. He was lucky they caught him in time. This book isn't just about self-harm, he had the potential to hurt or kill another human being. After his arrest, he was emotional, paranoid, with high anxiety. He had been using the drugs on himself for which there are known side-effects and withdrawal symptoms. Vanity, cosmetic procedures, anti-aging, sports performance enhancement. Why? What is the matter with our society? People don't need to be pretty or stronger. Wrinkles don't hurt, sports should be about teams and exercise, not becoming superhuman. Pretty or stronger is not a matter of life or death unless you make a choice to take those drugs. He was a physician, a scientist, the person with the most knowledge. He was treating patients who had serious illnesses and pain and he threw it away for vanity medicine? Glad I found this book. It's priced well as an ebook, making it affordable for everyone."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8872663-amanda", "userReview": "One of the most unlikeable first person authors I've finished. Even his repentance doesn't make him likeable. The idea that someone so smart could be so dumb. All of that for a hair peptide? Really? A man's bald spot did that much damage.

Let me first state that I am convinced we have the best governmental system on the face of this planet BUT anybody who thinks that it is perfect and a true reflection of a fair and unbiased system that dispenses \"justice\" is kidding themselves and probably never been subjected to the microscope of the many governmental agencies that have unlimited resources (compared to an individual) and charged with enforcing the myriad laws in this country. I base this statement upon personal experience with the system and even though it was almost 30 years ago it seems like yesterday. The similarities between the author's experience and mine are great. I did not have the legal expertise that was described in the book but that was my fault due to my inexperience in determining what was necessary to protect my interests. In other words, my stupidity. The justice system in this country is money driven. If you have the resources and the capability to make wise decisions an individual has a chance but that is as far as it goes. If, as in my case, you are charged with a felony and lose it is a Life sentence. I know because I have served it. It really doesn't matter what kind of written punishment the legal system applies no matter how insignificant. You will pay the price for the rest of your life. As rigorous as it was in the book, Dr. Kepler played the game well and did good. He had great people working for him, adequate resources and the proper attitude. Plus, in my opinion, he was lucky. So, enough of this soliloquy, it is a good book and will expand your horizon on life in today's world. Read it with an open mind and put yourself in his shoes."}, {"userName": "Lynn Perry", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487167-lynn-perry", "userReview": "Well-Written Expose Of One Man's Fall From Grace And The \"Beginnings\" Of His RecoveryOverall, I enjoyed this book. It was well-written, and the doctor came across as truly repentant, albeit with some tinge of ego-protecting rationalization at work. (But I think that's a trait many of us share and can relate to. ) The incredibly positive support he received from his employer and \"friends\" was obviously a testament to his character. (He actually got 20 people, some he hadn't seen in years to take off work and appear at a hearing for him.) Before noting a couple of personal observations that I feel compelled to make, while at the same time recognizing that they reflect nothing more than my own subjective opinions, I do want to note a more general concern about the doctor's failure to include any specifics concerning the community service work he was ordered to perform. Surely given the time frame covered by the book, he should have at least started that work - but he provided no information whatsoever about it. Now for my own two personal \"peeves\": I was somewhat disappointed with the doctor's lack of truthfulness in dealing with his daughter, especially with regard to his explanation of his ankle monitor since the memory of seeing some black box around your father's leg is likely one that would be retained by a child; presumably, she will eventually be told the truth, especially in light of the fact that he's now published a book about his criminal activity. I was also a little astounded by his half-hearted speculation at the end of the book about ressurecting his \"follicle work\" since it seemed to me that would border too closely with the practice of \"cosmetically-related\" medicine that he was required to give up."}, {"userName": "Leigh Podgorski", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6117177-leigh-podgorski", "userReview": "An Extraordinary Journey: Thank-You Dr. Kepler.I picked up this book because the sub-title led me to believe this memoir would be a juicy summertime confessional from a super ego driven by greed, just one more in a countless parade of egos and bottom-liners in a society quickly losing its heart, soul, dignity, and humanity. I couldn't have been more wrong.Dr. Kepler, and I will address him as nothing else, writes in a straightforward, unvarnished manor. His narrative is crisp, clear, often very funny and witty, often heart-wrenching, and brutally honest.I had to remind myself often that this guy had committed some hefty criminal acts as I found myself pulling so hard for him.He finds himself casting blame at times unto others, but almost immediately, he rescinds it, finding the true target: himself.There is one brief mention of a letter from a patient that writes re the high cost of meds in the US--which, indeed, is criminal, but a digression.Dr. Kepler bares his soul, and the journey he takes is nothing shy of true enlightenment. His courage is boundless. He has fallen to the Gates of Hell, and returned with a cleansed soul. And not only that, but with the greatness of spirit to share that journey.You must read this book.I finished it in tears. I will never forget Dr. Kepler, his journey, and his great courage."}, {"userName": "Marie Lutz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18846209-marie-lutz", "userReview": "A dissatisfied physician gets involved with illegally importing and prescribing drugs. After he's arrested he seeks redemption. My main problem with this book is that I'm not sure how much of it, or even if any of it, is true. The names of all the characters are fictional and the author uses a pseudonym so I see no way to check. The science and the proposed scientific methodology sometimes seems dubious. There's many twists in this book and much more drama than you'd normally expect to find in a true to life story. The supposed naivety of the protagonist is not always convincing. True or not it's a well written and at times gripping tale, although it's somewhat too long and the doctor whines too much and too repetitively about his sins. I'm giving this book 4 stars because of the story, which I basically enjoyed. But if I were to rate it on its veracity I'd give it 1 star because, right or wrong, I'm very suspicious."}, {"userName": "Shannon Lee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19188973-shannon-lee", "userReview": "An interesting read, although as a physician, I found myself shaking my head frequently at the lack of insight this man had. His ego was bigger than his integrity, unfortunately, and that is ultimately what this book is about. That and the fact that the entire memoire is obviously a catharsis for Dr Max Kepler, and for that he makes no apologies. He had the most amazing support from his ex-wife and colleagues. The book is a bit cumbersome as a literary work - too many descriptors of the mundane - the play-by-play details of morning ablutions and the garage where he parked his car, etc. Doesn't make for riveting prose but certainly helps to fill that magic minimum page requirement."}, {"userName": "Koren ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17535433-koren", "userReview": "I liked this book as a true crime because it was different. A doctor who commits an ethics violation and pays for it over and over. The first half of the book is about the crime. The second half is about all the hoops he had to go through to stay out of prison. The author of the book is the doctor, himself. I think he did a good job of telling the story from the perspective of all the players. While he has a likeable personality and you want him to come out on top, what he did was wrong and he knew it. It is scary to think that doctors could be doing what he did and getting away with it."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/828633-linda", "userReview": "What a journeyThis was quite the story of a doctor who decides to start prescribing hgh on the side and gets caught.

At the time of my arrest, I was a thirty-seven year old Harvard graduate with medical and post-doctoral degrees. I attended one of the finest residency and fellowship training programs in the world at the University of California, San Francisco. I played two sports in college, earned awards at every level of education and training, had wonderful friends and a beautiful three-year-old daughter. Having grown up the son of a restaurant manager and a housewife, I had transcended the humble beginnings of a small Midwestern town to become the quintessential American Dream.Or so I thought. But with my arrest on felony importation charges, everything I had worked so hard for was swept away and the entire trajectory of my life was indelibly altered. I would embark on a three year battle not only for my medical license, but also for my freedom. This journey would lead to intense personal introspection, and in that process, I would discover with ugliness, there was also beauty, and with punishment, mercy.There are many reasons I have written this manuscript, with one of the most important being that I hoped my story would resonate with others who have gone through difficult circumstances as a consequence of a dark side of their personality. With this book, I hope to inspire others to accept and embrace the good and bad, while continually striving for improved self-understanding and acceptance.I have changed names primarily for legal purposes, but the facts are unchanged. Although the events described in the book occurred more than ten years ago, I think about them nearly every day. The shame and humiliation are ever-present. Any simple Google search of my name reveals the truth, and that truth has affected me over and over, despite the years, as it probably should. As the judge told me that day in a federal courtroom, \"You have betrayed the public's trust.\" This is my confessional.", "title": "Confessions of an American Doctor: A true story of greed, ego and loss of ethics", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35180245-confessions-of-an-american-doctor", "average": 4.05, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1495335771l/35180245.jpg", "reviews": 30, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15796584.Max_Kepler", "name": "Max Kepler"}], "type": ["Crime", "Nonfiction", "Medical", "Autobiography", "Business"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35180245-confessions-of-an-american-doctor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32018099-confessions-of-an-american-doctor"]}
