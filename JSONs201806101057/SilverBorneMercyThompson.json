It becomes reasonably clear that the reader is getting roughly the same story with different covers. I've spent a lot of time considering this; the series has many ardent fans, and I used to be among them. I think it all depends on what one enjoys in a story, and how tolerant one is of repetition. I'd rate my tolerance somewhere in the middle, but only until the tipping point occurs, either through saturation or through pet peeve. I think series like this are best enjoyed exactly as they occur: published one at a time, a year in between. Then the repeated explanations and summaries don't irritate, they only recall, taking on the cadence of storytelling, when the reader slips into the story world with the beginning \"long, long ago and far, far away...\"Despite a reliance on folklore and fairy tales, the Mercy Thompson series is and remains a sanitized, muted version of those grim worlds. The slavering wolf can actually control themselves, if they are old and really powerful. The strange fae will probably help you if you amuse or respect them, but even the bad ones won't trap you for years, until your family has died off. All you have to remember is no thanking. There are scary vampires, but there's also one that wears t-shirts and watches movies, and a sheep necklace can protect you. None of the wolves go crazy despite frequent assertions that it can happen. No one except bad guys are ripped apart. Marsilia repents her actions. The fae victims are let go. The misguided humans are coached. Almost everyone gets a chance to redeem themselves. There's very little true evil. No one even swears. I note it because while it is one of the things I enjoy, that sense of ultimate goodness and happy endings, I also believe it explains part of the series' popularity. Unfortunately, familiarity also enables recognition of faults, and there are quite a few. The overall series arc lacks a sense of coherency. After reading through a number of the Briggs' family posts, its clear that the series expanded to accommodate popularity and not out of an internal sense of story progression. The first was written; Blood Bound came about because the first did well, followed by a surprise contract to buy three more books. I'd contrast this with another favorite, Ilona Andrews, who had a clear arc for a seven-book series and a sense of where it was headed in both story and emotion. The plotting to date in Mercy has been roughly the same for each book: someone is imprisoned. With Mercy's special powers, the group will save the day. This is true in Moon Called (Adam), Blood Bound (Stefen, etc.), Iron Kissed (Zee), Bone Crossed (Mercy) and Silver Bourne (spoiler/Mercy). The emotional plotting is also startlingly similar: Mercy will have trouble trusting her affection for Adam. After mistrusting him when she should not have, he will still support her and she will vow to trust him. At the same time, one of the powerful people she loves is willing to sacrifice/suicide. Binge-reading also draws attention to a narrative containing a lot of telling without showing. Mercy will have asides in every book telling about her history, the fae reservation, werewolves, the wolves' coming out and her relationships with Samuel and Adam. Usually she will also explain Zee and the Grey Lords, and Stefen and the seethe. I think this is generally forgivable to many readers as the familiarity echos the storytelling tradition, and the ritual of description, but again distance makes the heart grow fonder.But those are mostly academic issues. What I've found less personally enjoyable, and perhaps even less forgivable are the roles women have in the series. Which is very little: Mercy operates in a man's world, both figuratively and literally. Mercy herself demonstrates no particular direct agency; all of the plots start with her reacting to an event that happens to her genuine, unsuspecting little self. The reader is quickly introduced to the idea that women associated with werewolf packs 'hate' Mercy, and that becomes an ongoing theme through the series. Even human women dislike Mercy, as Gabriel's mom Sylvia does. The exception to agency is Blood Bound, where the evil and conniving Marsilia engineers an elaborate trap, although clearly she still hates Mercy. I realized that even side characters are almost universally male with the exception of a couple of inscrutable fae. The only exceptions being Mercy's mom--who is never more than a whirlwind in and out of the scene--and Adam's daughter, Jesse. I found it disappointing, particularly from a female author with girls of her own.Silver Bourne was the gestalt for me, highlighting all the redundancies. It comes as no surprise then, that a book lent to Mercy by a bookstore owner (male) may have other properties, and that the werewolves in the pack are still trying to break Adam and Mercy up. Samuel is sick at heart and only his wolf saves him, and now Mercy must save his wolf. Mercy's home is targeted. Someone is kidnapped and Mercy must save them, and Adam endures several challenges. Samuel's depression plot was solved very easily and tritely by L-U-V, which I thought disappointing after the complicated emotional fallout of the rape back in Iron Kissed. It was the last book of the series I bought, back in the day when I was silly enough to still auto-buy authors. Three and a half redundancies, rounding down because that's what I did last time."}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "Patricia Briggs does not disappoint us in Silver Borne, the 5th book in her fabulous Mercy Thompson Series.\n\nWe continue following Mercy\u2019s life and the world that she lives in\u2026trouble always follows her as she throws herself into saving or helping her friends.

My passion for this sub-genre has been waning because there has been SO much of it out there, but Mercy is one of the originals, and a really good heroine, working-class, compassionate and never perfect. I think I actually enjoyed this installment in the series better than the last, the characters were really fleshed out, the mystery was well-plotted.

Briggs is a good writer. But by the next morning, all I could think of were complaints. I suspect I'll be in the minority in disliking this, though.There's no Stephan at all. Maybe the author thinks everybody is sick of vampires. I'm not. I'm sick of the damned Fae. Their presence has ruined this series for me. They're too otherworldy and overly-magical for the kind of urban fantasy I enjoy. I've always liked Zee pretty well, but I disliked extremely the whole long sequence with the Fae towards the end of this book. The previous book revolved around the Fae also, but at least it had a better overall plot than this one.I don't like that Briggs has made her werewolves have split personalities. I can see that a werewolf would think of himself as having a different identify when he transforms, but to give the inner wolf an actual separate personality is taking that too far. And while I usually like pack dynamics, they were fairly pathetic here.Finally, I didn't like the pat resolution to the Samuel problem. I felt unsatisfied and disappointed at the end of this book, and I won't be jumping to buy the next one as soon as it releases."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4255477-angela", "userReview": "[WTF was she doing taking Jesse into Elphame??

This was a decent book as part of the ongoing Mercy Thompson urban fantasy series, and worth reading for those who are already into this series, but not one of my favorites in this series. It combines two or three plotlines:(1) Mercy's ongoing issues with the werewolf pack, which become her mate Adam's issues, which leads to some insurrection in the ranks and a mixed martial arts kind of fight for position in the pack, including that of the Alpha. The disclosure of the conspiracy and the martial arts fights were interesting reading -- Briggs said she worked with her husband (? IIRC) to write them in as authentic a way as possible, and it shows. BUT this plotline about the pack's issues with Mercy has passed its Sell By date, for my money.(2) The \"Silver Borne\" artifact plot, which ties into a personal crisis that Mercy's old friend Samuel is having. I enjoyed the Sam/Samuel part of this plot; the Silver Borne artifact plot wasn't particularly memorable for me.More complete review to come, probably."}, {"userName": "samantha  (books-are-my-life20)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27251572-samantha-books-are-my-life20", "userReview": "I never get tired of this series!!!

Mercy's world is full of magical creatures, most of which deserve their monster label. Our part time coyote is once again entangled in a game of life and death, as much as she tries to convince her friends and pack mates that she does not actively look for trouble. Last time the vampires were gunning for her, this time the local Fae are looking for something she is in possession of, though she is not exactly sure what that is. On the wolfpack front there is unrest brewing as well. The power structure is shaky since Adam brought Mercy in and she took her place as the alpha's mate. The cracks in the pack magic, partially created by her long time refusal to be his mate, have lead to power struggles and threaten Adam's authority and leave him open to challenges by other dominant and power hungry wolfs. And also, how utterly ridiculous for a gorgeous, powerful alpha like Adam to hook up with a half breed lowly coyote like trailer trash Mercy!!! What would the other wolfpacks think???So, while it seems that the people who should have her back are doing everything but, and random Faes are also randomly targeting her with malicious intent, she is also faced with trying to find a reason for her best friend to stay alive... Did I mention she is still dealing with the residual panic attacks following a very traumatic experience while under the influence of mind control??? Yea, all this while trying to earn her bacon by working as a mechanic during the day and somehow succeeding in staying sane! Now there is a woman we can use as a role model! This book was not as fluid and naturally flowing as the others up to now, but that did not make it any less interesting and compelling. We learn more about the Fae and pack politics, and we also see the growing devotion between Adam and Mercy. All characters undergo changes and the story continues to expand. We fall deeper into the thrall of Patricia Brigg's writing and are left with no choice but to keep on reading ... I may or may not be bespelled into jumping straight in the next volume... I have to go and chain myself to the book, so I wish all of you happy reading!!!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344685-sarah", "userReview": "1st Read August 2010 - Rating 5 *2nd Read March 20143rd Read January 20164th Read February 2017 - Rating reduces to 4 *5th Read February 2018Original ReviewWhen Mercy gets a message asking her to look after a fae book that she had previously borrowed she is curious about what has happened to it's owner. Then she finds herself being targeted by a mysterious fae who is not only after her but also targeting Adam and her pack but what does this have to do with the book? To make matters worse Samuel, who's depression has been worsening over the months, has taken a turn for the worse. For survival Samuel's wolf has taken control but that makes him dangerous - and marks him for death if Adam and the Marrock find out. Can Mercy help Samuel regain control before the other werewolves find out what has happened and what does the powerful fae want with the book?Although this review won't contain spoilers for Silver Borne as this is book 5 in the Mercy Thompson series it will be impossible to review without giving spoilers for previous books in the series. If you haven't read the rest of the series then I wouldn't recommend reading any further but I would suggest you check out Moon Called as this is one of my favorite urban fantasy series and Mercy is definitely one of my favorite heroines!Anyone who has read any of the books in this series will already know that Mercy has a knack for drawing attention of the supernatural races who are more powerful than she is. She may be a Walker (a shifter who can turn into a Coyote) but her powers are limited - especially when compared to the werewolves or fae. Having come up against the fae before she is understandably wary when she finds herself being targeted again but she is determined to protect her friends and find out what is going on.My favorite part of this book has to be the interaction between Adam & Mercy, I just love them both as a couple & it is nice to watch their relationship develop since their mating in the last book. There are some really sweet, emotional scenes between the two of them and if anything I now love Adam even more. We get to see a more vulnerable side to him in this installment but he is still all alpha male. Mercy is still trying to get used to the pack bonds and most of the pack still aren't happy that she is now one of them. I enjoyed finding out more about the pack politics and seeing Mercy learn how to deal with this new bond and the werewolves who are against her.Samuel has been one of my favorite characters ever since we first met him and although I didn't want him & Mercy to end up together, I do want to see him have his own happy ending. I felt so sad for him in the last book as you could see how badly he was feeling but parts of this book had my heart breaking for him. As an old wolf he has lived too long and has started to give up on life. Mercy loves him and wants to protect him but when his wolf takes control she is very worried about what could happen. Having a wolf in control is a very dangerous thing for both the wolf and for everyone surrounding him - if the Marrock finds out what has happened he will have no choice other than killing Samuel. If I had one slight complaint about this story it would be that things with Samuel tied up a little too easily but I'm hoping we will get to explore more about what happens with him in the next book.If you're a fan of this series then I'm sure Silver Borne won't disappoint, it is one of my favorite books in the series. I enjoyed the action and mystery surrounding the fae artifact but for me it was the relationship development between the characters that made the story. If you haven't read this series yet then I can't recommend it strongly enough. It's going to be a long wait until River Marked but I'm looking forward to getting stuck into the Alpha and Omega series in the meantime.________________________________2nd ReadReread with AngeI loved it just as much the second time around. I can't believe how much of the story I'd forgotten, nearly the whole book came as a complete surprise so it was like reading it for the first time all over again! I just love, love, love Mercy and Adam together, they are such a brilliant couple. This is as far as I ever got with the series so I can't wait to get started on River Marked to find out what happens next!________________________________3rd ReadBuddy read with AngeSince it's been nearly 2 years since Ange & I buddy read this series last we decided we're well overdue another read in the run up to the release of Fire Touched next March.I love this series so much! The characters, the world building just everything about these books makes them a comfort read for me. Along with Ilona Andrews's Kate Daniels series this is probably my most reread series & I never get tired of it.________________________________4th ReadMercy & Adam are so cute together, Sam breaks my heart and I adore Bran!

I adored this installment of the Mercy series, and it is definitely one of my favorites. This book was a bit of a change from the rest of the series though. Usually Mercy's adventures are action driven with a lot of humor, wit, danger, and a sprinkle of romance to tease readers. With this book though romance definitely took the front seat in terms of plot with action/plot taking a more secondary role. Either way though it was fantastic.The plot combined my 2 favorite elements in the Mercy universe - Werewolves and the Fae. Werewolf politics are amazingly structured, confusing, and strict. Every peek we get into the complexities of dominance, gender issues, and the magic behind their ties is so detailed, insightful, and engaging. The Fae continue to be the more intriguing and mystifying species that I have come across in any urban fantasy series. The character development is wonderful as well. Samuel has been on the back burner a bit since Mercy became Adam's mate and getting a peek into his very old mind and the strife he is dealing with was great. Although discovering just what a teddy bear Adam can be, and his intense and unconditional love for Mercy was beautiful. Mercy herself grew a great deal in this book as well. She has come to accept and welcome the pack, wants to belong, wants to be involved, all while retaining her independence and unique qualities. I only wish we could have seen her as a coyote more this book. Some of my favorite secondary characters like Zee, Warren, and Ben made appearances this time around and any chance to have them in a scene is totally welcomed. Crazily enough I cannot think of a bad thing to say about this book. Others have thought negatively on the length of the challenge scene which I greatly enjoyed as it revealed so much more about hierarchy in packs, or Mercy's ability to always get out of her insane problems with little consequence (although the climax of Iron Kissed disproves this greatly I think). Yes, the solutions through out these books tend to be a bit convenient but are well thought through, developed, and make sense. All in all, this is the best urban fantasy series out there, and to me all others are weighted against it. I can't wait for the next anything Brigg's puts out! Especially the 3rd installment in the Alpha and Omega series!*****Review of the audio book January 2011:This installment is still one of my favorites of the series. There was so much character development in this book, and a much clearer understanding of Mercy's interaction and place within the pack. Again, I wish there had been more explanation into Sam's developments, but hopefully one day she will write a great short story or something about it!

Anyone who has been following my reviews probably already knows how much I love this series and this book was no exception. It was so nice to re-visit this wonderful story and spend more time with characters that I have grown to love. This wasn't the most exciting book in the series or my favorite but it was still a very solid read. Mercy has a lot to deal with in this installment. She needs to find the owner of the bookstore where she borrowed a very special book in a previous installment. It seems that he might be in some kind of trouble and someone wants to get his hands on the book. Samuel is in crisis and his wolf is in control. Mercy knows that if he doesn't come around quickly then it will be the end for Samuel so she wants to give him some time to sort things out. There are also a few issues concerning the pack and Mercy's relationship with Adam. Not everyone in the pack is happy to have Mercy as a member. Being a part of a pack is new to Mercy and she isn't used to how easily they can get in her head. Adam and Mercy do love each other and take some steps to get things worked out.My favorite parts of this book were the sections that dealt with the pack and Adam. It is kind of fun after reading the whole series to see how much things have changed over the course of the series. I think that both Mercy and Adam took some major steps in this book to strengthen their relationship and Mercy's place in the pack. The issues with Samuel were also very well done. I really do enjoy his character and he is really in a bad place for much of this book. Lorelei King is the voice of Mercy Thompson. She does such a wonderful job narrating this series that I usually want to move to the next book just as soon as I finish a book. The character's emotions really come across perfectly with her narration and she is able to voice a large number of characters very well. I look forward to listening to this narrator many more times in the future.I would highly recommend this book to others. This is a series that really needs to be read in order since the character relationships are a large part of the story.

Not too many I think. So I have decided to do a list of what I love about this book:1. Mercy & Adam- I love that rather then them having an immediate love-you-till-you-die connection that it seems to have grown and in this book you really see how deep the bond between them is. Indivdually, especially Mercy, they are likable characters brave and honest and the more I read about them, the more I like them.2. Samuel- OMG MY POOR SAM! I love how Sam has developed from a possible love interest for Mercy to such a good friend and I can't wait to see how things pan out for him.3. The World- I was right, the Fae are DEFINITELY the creepiest and scariest of all the races that Patricia Briggs has created. Werewolves are primitive, volatile and violent, but they still have human connections and family and Pack are important to them; Vampires are creepy and cold but even they have a Seethe that they protect and they used to be human. But the Fae are ruthless, calculating and if vampires are cold some of the Fae are just glacial, Ms Briggs gives them such an air of Otherness that for me they seem the most dangerous. There are lots of other things I like about this series as well, the writing for example although nothing fancy manages to put the story across with a great deal of clarity and it really feels like you are looking through Mercy's eyes.LOVE LOVE LOVE Mercy Thompson."}, {"userName": "Duchess Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2204947-duchess-nicole", "userReview": "Seriously, this is one of the most kick ass Urban Fantasy series out there. Mercy is the best type of heroine in that she's so atypical, it's impossible not to love her. She's more likeable than Rachel from the Hollows series by Kim Harrison, she's more down to earth than the pseudo romance-slash-UF series heroines out there. She's the best friend I never had, and considering all the beasties and baddies coming after her, that may be a good thing. In this installment, the bond between her and Adam is tested over and over. If I ever hand any doubts about their devotion or the strength of the mating bond between this unlikely duo, then all my questions were answered in Silver Borne. Not to mention the entirely new spin she puts on a handful of characters already fitted into the story. So much happens in each Mercy book, I can't even begin to name it all. Suffice it to say, this series is effing amazing.I'll end with a favorite quote from Adam to Mercy:\"He sighed. \"I don't think an apology will do, Mercy. Because an apology implies that you wouldn't do it again. And, under the circumstances, you wouldn't do anything differently, would you?\"\"No.\"\"And you shouldn't have to apologize for being right,\" he said with a sigh. \"Much as I'd like to tell you differently.\"Love that guy :D"}, {"userName": "Annie (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489554-annie-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Posted on Under the CoversIt\u2019s the return of the Fae in Silver-Borne!

We\u2019ll just have to see as the Mercy Thompson saga continues.Silver-Borne is another solid instalment in the Mercy Thompson series! If you haven\u2019t read this, get on it quick!

Since I have a section of my bookshelves dedicated to this series I thought it would be fun to make a book fold to add.I decided I wanted to do a wolf howling at the moon (yes I get that Mercy is a Coyote but the majority of characters in the series are werewolves and the first book in the series is Moon Called!).I found this image online and decided to use it as inspiration for my book fold:\nIt's a little harder to see the details on a book fold but I'm pretty pleased with the way it turned out:\nWhat do you think? I really like it but I think I might have to try and come up with a design with a Coyote paw print to match Mercy's tattoo next LOL."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50378-angie", "userReview": "Is there anything like holding the latest Mercy Thompson novel in your hands? Especially when it's all large and hardback and glowing? Because the window on this book seriously glows. And the spine and back are warm and golden and it's just so much prettier than the online images led me to believe. These are the simple things that make me happy. A beautiful dust jacket. A favorite author doing well. Spending time once more with characters who are friends now and who are none the worse for wear for our time apart. In fact, just a handful of pages into SILVER BORNE it was like we'd never been apart at all. After reading the first three books in the series, I convinced DH he wanted in on this action. So we've read them all aloud together now and it's so nice having that to look forward to each night. Suffice it to say, neither of us was disappointed in the slightest. This is the series that started my love for urban fantasy and so it will necessarily always hold a special place in my heart. But what a feat to be able to say that five books in Patricia Briggs still owns. Mercy and Co. haven't missed a step and it was infinitely delightful to sink back into this world that I love and get up to all sorts of mischief with these characters who continue to make me smile no matter how dark the day.Mercy keeps her life busy these days. Her days filled to the brim working at her garage with Gabriel and Zee, her nights taken up looking out for her roommate Sam, hanging with the local pack, and dating their Alpha. She stays busy enough that things like the lingering effects of recent trauma and returning that book she borrowed awhile back get shoved to the back of her mind. Until something triggers her flinch reflex, that is. Or someone comes looking for the book who perhaps should not be allowed to have it. So when Samuel starts displaying more worrisome tendencies than is normal for a lone wolf and Mercy starts hearing voices and feeling dangerous impulses not her own, she knows things are bound to get worse before they get better. On her side she's got Adam and the members of his pack who do not resent her for bonding with their boss and snagging a coveted spot in the pack hierarchy. She's also got Zee--the crotchety old fae mechanic who is older than dirt, watches out for her, and should not be underestimated. On the other side Mercy's got a handful of wolves who've got no reason to love her, a powerful unidentified fae who wants something she's got, and a pack of demons riding her friend Samuel--all of whom prove darker than she at first thought. But in the end it's up to Mercy to put the pieces together and beat the clock to save her friends and those who rely on her from their monsters--both the ones they can see and the ones they can't.I don't know what goes on in Ms. Briggs' head when she sits down to write a new installment in this excellent series, but what comes out is pure, unadulterated magic. SILVER BORNE lived up to my every expectation and then some. There were a whole host of loose threads left lingering around at the end of Bone Crossed and, though they are not all tied up here (oh, Stefan, how I miss you), the pacing and development of plot threads here is masterful. Patricia Briggs is unparalleled when it comes to consistently strong characters, forward-moving plot lines, and heart-palpitating climaxes. There are no stagnant elements, no pointless meanderings, no annoying red herrings. There is only adrenaline and affection and a burning desire to find out what happens. Fifty pages from the end I turned to Aaron, just shook my head, and said, \"She seriously crafts the best endings. They're always so genuinely exciting.\" And it's to do with the endlessly clever ways in which she weaves together classic mythology with her characters' personal histories and wraps them all up in an unfailing sense of urgency. The villains are smart, dark, and not necessarily operating under the assumptions you think they are. The good guys are brave, torn, and absolutely worth staying up late to root for. But most of all there's Mercy. She's the beginning and the end as far as I'm concerned. She's got dirt under her nails and independence running through her veins. She's as playful as the coyote she shifts into and good to the core. No wonder we love her. SILVER BORNE is one headlong dose of action and surprisingly sweet interpersonal exploration. Finest kind."}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "\"I thought you were dead,\" he said...\"Stupid,\" I said. \"As if I'd die without taking you with me.\"He smiled faintly.\nMercy has grown on me throughout this series. She still isn't as much of a smartass as I would like, but she is becoming more and more fun as time goes on. In this book, she is dealing with Samuel's issues while trying to figure out where Phin, the bookstore owner, has gone. On top of that, she has Adam's pack messing with her because some of them are not happy with her status as Adam's mate. So, there is a lot going on. And, as usual, Mercy ends up dealing with bad guys, getting hurt, going off on her own, etc..etc... And, as usual, it is all without Adam. I don't know why the author gave Mercy a boyfriend who she has to leave on the sidelines every time that Mercy does anything. I get that he is a nice guy, but the fact that he has such a short fuse, and is so over-protective would drive me crazy. I feel like the author has to make up reasons to get Adam out of the way for Mercy to go running off on an adventure without him every book because he would just take over and spoil everything. And, for Mr. Macho Pack Leader, she sure has saved his ass a lot. I'm just saying...It is nice to see Samuel have a story, but he is in wolf form for much of the book and so we don't get to have him speaking - which is a bummer. And, the bad news is that there is absolutely no Stefan in this book. :(But, Jesse is developing into a pretty good character, and so is Ben. I would like to see Ben get a storyline in the future."}, {"userName": "Midu Hadi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2260566-midu-hadi", "userReview": "Let me begin by saying. I love this series. It might be due to one of these many reasons:Mercy kicks butt and she is so messed up that she can't function socially-love that about her.She knows her limitations and isn't all powerful.The author dealt with certain unsavory issues beautifully.The romance took 5 books to develop into something that can be called a relationship.Its just so refreshing to meet an Alpha who doesn't thrust his will on his partner and is willing to put up with her going against his will.Adam is also Mercy's match when it comes to being messed up and they are cute together.I love how the author doesn't overlook details that many readers would nit pick at- when Mercy and Samuel(as a wolf) go to the see Adam at the hospital, the author even points out that Samuel had rolled in the mud to cover the blood on him. It didn't even register what she had done till I read this.This book specifically cleared up things about Samuel and it was a relief.And of course, most importantly, I love the humor-there's nothing more fun than a smart mouthed heroine!I'm going to put off reading the next one for as long as I can since I don't want to be done with the series so soon!"}, {"userName": "Lisa Kay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2459470-lisa-kay", "userReview": "[ (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Bj", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27341466-bj", "userReview": "5 \"Traitors, Fae Magic & Self-Sacrifices\" Stars for the story and narration!Wow, Patricia Briggs really outdoes herself in Silver Borne!
