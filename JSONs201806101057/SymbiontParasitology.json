I gave a Mira Grant book 2 stars.It pains me to do so, it really does, but this series, in general, has not impressed me at all. Parasite/Symbiont was intended originally to be a duology but it has now transformed into a trilogy with Symbiont becoming nothing more than a seriously massive tome of filler. It was a huge undertaking to get through this (a total of 23 days which is fairly unheard of for me) but there\u2019s no denying that it definitely lacked direction.By now we\u2019ve had our fair share of romances between humans and well, non-humans. All members of the supernatural (vampires, werewolves, fairies and even zombies) and while I\u2019m all for diversity in romances, I\u2019m not sure human and tapeworm were ever on my wishlist. When news of this series first came to light, I was definitely intrigued. A tapeworm named The Intestinal Bodyguard is the answer to anything from allergies to colds, yet it does much more than anticipated when the tapeworms learn how to overtake their human bodies and claim them as their own. The transformation process went differently for some. Sal, a chimera, developed a personality and even formed a romance with Nathan, the son of Dr. Shanti Cale the co-creator of the original tapeworm. Others weren\u2019t so fortunate and now infect the streets of San Francisco in search of sustenance (basically a zombie, but they\u2019re called sleepwalkers). The inclusion of the romance angle was a bit far-fetched and I felt that there were enough interesting aspects of this story going on that it didn\u2019t need to be included. Plus, it\u2019s kind of gross, but who am I to judge I guess.One of the main issues I had with Parasite were some various plot holes that could have swallowed a building. Most specifically was Sal\u2019s fear of cars that supposedly developed after her car accident, however, she was still human at the time of the accident. Her tapeworm didn\u2019t take over her brain until following the accident. It never quite made sense that she took on her same phobia yet none of her memories or anything else. There was a clumsy attempt to backtrack and explain this, basically, the phobia was ingrained into her during counseling sessions when she was still at SymboGen, and while this would explain it it was far from a sufficient justification because huh? Why would the scientists trouble themselves with making sure Sal remained scared of cars? Baffling.The conclusion of Parasite left off with Sal just barely escaping SymboGen, but unfortunately, her \u2018tapeworm sister\u2019 Tansy was captured in the process. A chunk of the novel is spent on finding her location and concocting a dangerous rescue mission just to get her back. The rest of the novel involves other dangerous acts that constantly put the characters in unnecessary danger in a failed attempt to generate an enticing intensity. First, there was the foray back to the horde infected streets of San Francisco because, whoops, we left the dogs at home! Then there\u2019s the medical condition of Sal\u2019s that naturally can\u2019t be treated in the lab so another trip into the city is required. Then Sal gets kidnapped a few times by various individuals. There\u2019s a lot happening within these 500+ pages but it\u2019s all inconsequential stuff that doesn\u2019t need to be happening if that makes sense. It was all entirely too tedious for my liking. I\u2019ll likely pick up the final installment Chimera since I\u2019m already so invested, but my expectations are near rock bottom at this point.I received this book free from the Publisher in exchange for an honest review.

She was a fearful, wishy washy joke of a character that excelled at getting hurt and placing herself in ridiculous situations due to her stupidity. Maybe its been a while since I read the last book, but I really loved that book. But I couldn't get into this one. She is afraid of everything from people smiling with teeth, and riding with cars. The drama every time she stepped foot in a vehicle got on my nerves. She cares for the sleepwalkers well being, then she bludgeons one to death. She wants to save them, then they are repulsive. She considers people her family, but doesn't really react when one is believed dead. She blames herself for the end of the world, but doesn't want to help solve it as its an invasion of her privacy.It was grating. Really grating. Playing the victim, attempting to play the hero, landing herself in trouble, captured by the next \"bad guy\", getting out by pure luck. Again and again and again. I wanted to like this book. I adore every other book written by Mira Grant (not counting Fed). But this one completely missed the mark. It suffers a bit from second book syndrome. There was absolutely no real progression thoughout the book. While a few details are added to our knowledge about the sleepwalkers, I really don't feel like this book had a clear goal in mind.

But when I discovered that this duology somehow grew to become a trilogy, I felt nothing but satisfaction and joy. More books from Mira Grant are always good news to me. In fact, if Parasitology suddenly became a 180 books long medical thriller/soap opera hybrid, I\u2019d still be a happy camper. That\u2019s how much I admire this author and trust in her ability to always, always deliver.Like Parasite, Symbiont is mostly told from Sal Mitchell\u2019s perspective, with diary entries, chapters and correspondence from other characters in between. Sal\u2019s voice is nothing like what we usually get from Mira Grant. She is a frightened girl, hesitant, unsure, often whiny, and a follower by her own admission. For the most part, Sal doesn\u2019t even try to be brave (which can admittedly be a tad exhausting at times), but in Symbiont, we witness her growing at least somewhat stronger and more confident. She will never be the most traditional heroine, but then again, she\u2019s not the most traditional human being, so I suppose that\u2019s all right.My experience with medical thrillers is virtually nonexistent which makes it impossible for me to compare Symbiont with others of its kind, but the amount of research behind this book is obvious and quite impressive. One could never accuse Grant of doing things halfway. The science in her science fiction is always so believable and infinitely scary. I kept imagining my brain being slowly eaten by a parasite and let me tell you, it was not a pleasant thought at all.The pacing could have been better, especially in the first half. I felt that some events included were absolutely inconsequential and that the story would have functioned a lot better without them. But the second half of the book has no such issues \u2013it was, in fact, so tense that I sometimes forgot to breathe. In addition to her excellent worldbuilding, Grant\u2019s characterization is, as always, superb. This stands true for more than just Sal \u2013 each and every one of her characters is built to perfection. Through Dr. Cale and Dr. Banks, we are offered insight into the minds of two mad scientists with brilliant minds and sociopathic tendencies. Dr. Cale was especially interesting in that regard because she actually tried to adhere to basic ethical and behavioral standards, but it was always a conscious effort, not something that came naturally. I\u2019ve also noticed that Grant always includes a slightly unhinged, homicidal girl (Foxy in Blackout and Tansy in Parasite and Symbiont) as the perfect source of comic relief. This may be a template character for Grant, but it is always endlessly entertaining to me. \n\u201dHello?\u201d I tried again. \u201cLook, I\u2019m all like, barefoot and lying in yuck, and that\u2019s a serious infection risk, so could you maybe come and get me and take me somewhere clean? Or better, give me back my shoes and let me go? I promise not to murder you even a little.\u201d\nWhile Parasitolgy didn\u2019t necessarily capture my heart like Newsflesh before it, its quality is unquestionable. I have no doubt that we\u2019ll be getting a spectacular finale next year. I for one can\u2019t wait to get my hands on it."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay", "userReview": "I'm going to go out on a limb here, but I really didn't love this. I'm a huge fan of Seanan's work normally, but this one felt over-long and drawn out with just too much standing around in rooms vacillating about what to do next when only the bad guys seem to have a plan.The first one was alright, although the \"big reveal\" was completely obvious to everyone but the main character, who even reflects in this book that retrospectively even she thought it was obvious. This next one has Sal and Nathan with one group of scientist's working on the problem of the Sleepwalkers. Fairly early on there's a completely manufactured plot twist that requires Sal to risk herself in public where she promptly gets exposure to two of the three other groups who are looking for her. That just leads off into a narrative of risk, capture, exposition and escape that continues for the rest of the book.This is middle book syndrome in spades and a judicious edit would probably have sliced it down to a much smaller book and potentially allowed this to be the duology it was originally planned as.A rare misstep for this author I think."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5476515-amanda", "userReview": "3.5 stars.

Check it out for more reviews! Only Mira Grant could write a series about tapeworm horror, and make it compelling, intelligent, well thought out and absolutely terrifying.The Parasitology series explores a world dominated by science, where people rely on tapeworm implants for perfect health and longevity. While Parasite explored how this technology was invented and how it was adopted across the globe, Symbiont explores the detrimental and disastrous effects of the implant, as people using implants become cold, empty shells \u2013 or zombies.As an avid zombie fan, I\u2019ve heard about diseases, bites and airbourne viruses causing the affliction, but this is the first time tapeworms have become the primary cause of death. It\u2019s sickly fascinating, gruesome and unimaginable \u2013 but somehow, with the justification of science, it becomes believable in this dark and chilling world.I won\u2019t provide any spoilers for Parasite, but Symbiont was as chilling and addictive as the first. As if the tapeworms and zombies weren\u2019t enough, Sal experiences many dark and sinister situations totally out of her control. From being strapped down by a military organisation, to being operated on by scientists, to being held captive against her will by a sick man, I experienced complete and utter horror at some of these situations and the immoral and evil behaviour of people once the world goes mad.Sal\u2019s genuine, intelligent and inquisitive nature makes her a survivor, and I was proud of her leadership, strength and resolve no matter how dangerous the situation. While the events of Parasite left her reeling and unsure of herself, she really grows in confidence by the end of the book. Symbiont made me love Nathan more, in all of his geeky, scientific glory and his loyalty and love for Sal.We are introduced to some fantastic new characters, from Ronnie, the tapeworm assassin who is stuck in a man\u2019s body, to Fishy, a man in denial who believes he\u2019s stuck in a video game.There are a few problems with plot continuity however, as without the kidnapping and saving, not much actually happened in the book. At over 600 pages, you\u2019d expect more to happen outside of repeating the events of the previous book and having our character being thrust in a whole range of situations.Symbiont is not just a book about tapeworms, or zombies, or even science. It explores the scary effects of a world relying on an untested technology, opposing views of different scientists and organisations, and the blurred lines between human, scientific subject and tapeworm. From tapeworms burrowing into our skulls, to scientists on the ruthless quest for knowledge to evil profiteering companies, there are so many terrifying situations in this book.It also leaves us with the chilling notion \u2013 if we discovered an incredibly risky cure to all diseases, would we use it?I received a review copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "\u2615 Kimberly ", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082615-kimberly", "userReview": "If you have not yet read Parasite I suggest you swallow the red pill and slip down the rabbit-hole that is Grant\u2019s brilliant mind and join the rest of us in this frighteningly real apocalyptic future.This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill -- the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill -- you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.- Morpheus, The Matrix, 1999Grant allows us to effortlessly slip back into this multiple perspective tale, complete with journal and audio-recorded journals from characters trapped in this world. In Parasite we opened the doors wide, were both horrified, and fascinated by the world Grant had created beyond those doors. In this second novel, we begin to see the cracks as we gain insider information into the plans of several key characters and leaders in this chaotic zombie infested world. Unaffected folks are quarantined, a new species walks among us and sides are being drawn. The tale that unfolds kept me riveted with none of the symptoms of second book syndrome in sight.One of the things I love about Grant (Seanan McGuire) is her ability to create fleshed out characters. Sal is such a curious character and we see character growth as she continues to define herself. Nathan, our geeky hero has moments where he shines, but I want more from him. Adam has such a childlike curiosity but we glimpse something more. Dr. Cole and Dr. Banks are ever present and while one shows more compassion than the other you cannot help but ask yourself, \u201cHow much sacrifice justifies knowing?\u201d Sherman is perhaps the character whom I fear the most, and Ronnie is one I am eager to learn more about. Fishy, is a secondary character who I adore. The man is fearless, and downright hilarious. I have his six at all times. Grant, do not let anything happen to him. Tansy oh Gads! *tries to swallow* I cannot talk about it. I need more answers.In Symbiont, we gain some answers but they are quickly replaced with larger questions that are more pressing and I cannot wait to see how it unfolds in Chimera, the final book set to release sometime in 2015. The world is in chaos as implants turn folks into flesh-eating mindless zombies. We see some glimpse of intelligence from some of them, and as always, I cannot wait to see how that develops. Their link to Sal is fascinating, and hints at untapped potential.\u00a0\u00a0Grant continues to raise questions for the reader, as each revelation and man\u2019s interaction make you ponder the implications. You cannot help but question what our society\u2019s future holds. The brilliant aspect of this post-apocalyptic horror is how realistic it all sounds. Just turn on the television, open up a science or discovery magazine.

If you haven't read that book, don't read further!I seriously do not know where I stand on this book. Mira Grant is so good at development. It's not so much that I believe that this world could really happen so much as she makes it all sound so good that I buy it despite how unrealistic it arguably is. (For the life of me, I can not believe anyone would opt to implant a tapeworm inside them!) However, the subject matter in this series is such a representation of, like, my entire host of fears.I can't even handle earthworms, let alone a tapeworm!And the worst part is that they never let you forget about those damn tapeworms! Multiple times in each chapter they're describing their soft bodies, or reminding you that they're only functioning because a tapeworm is behind the wheel of the human body. No matter what anyone says, sex is NOT hot when you know that one character is a dang tapeworm!It's just too much. It's too gross for me. Call me shallow but I don't know how I would feel if I found out my significant other was actually a worm inside. It reminds me a little of that gross alien guy in Men in Black.

Maybe 3.5 stars? I think Mira Grant could write a traffic ticket and I'd read it. :D I've been anxiously waiting for this book since I finished reading book one, \"Parasite\", in October of 2013. I was delighted when it was announced several moths ago that instead of two books, Grant will write three in this series. Frankly, I doubt she could have wrapped this up in two books. And these books are not short. \"Parasite\" was 512 pages and \"Symbiont\" is 516 pages. With plots as twisty and complex as Grants, she needs those pages.\"Symbiont\" starts shortly after \"Parasite\" ended as Sal and company confirm their suspicions about the tapeworm in her body. That's the first of numerous revelations and twists and turns throughout the book. As in the first book, a few things were predictable but for the most part I never quite knew where Grant was going or what would happen next. As the revelations about the tapeworms and the infected come out, Grant gives us mini treatises on the nature of consciousness, souls, memory, gender, and identity. She also explores the notion of family, a recurring theme throughout all of her books, regardless of subject or genre. She uses Sal, Sal's boyfriend Nathan, his mother Dr. Cale, as well as another doctor, Dr. Banks, and several of Dr. Cale's other children to explore these questions. The book isn't all seriousness, there's humor and even romance, but this is not the book for when you want a light, easy read or a quick read.There are no easy answers in Symbiont. The humans in America are at war with the infected and both sides play dirty. There doesn't seem to be a solution that allows for a peaceful co-existence. Who will win? Who should win? Which side do you root for? Sal is particularly conflicted as she belongs to both sides. While there's a fair amount of action, Sal gets taken prisoner at least three times by my count, much of the book is a mix of emotional and cerebral. Sometimes that meant the pace suffered and I would wish for something to happen. Grant makes you think and makes you feel. Once again, Nathan is too good and too understanding to the point of not feeling real. But every other character is fully formed and developed. Fishy, a new character, is both charming and scary. I liked him but didn't completely trust him.\"Symbiont\" blends science, horror, romance, and family dysfunction with philosophy and mythical hero's quest into a story that grabs you, that pokes at your comfort levels, and keeps you reading to what will happen, what might happen, and what will the new world look like.

The third book, Chimera, is set to release late 2015. This was hands down my least favorite book Mira Grant or Seanan McGuire (her other pen name) has written. I am a huge fan of all of Mira Grant's/Seanan McGuire's other books. For some reason though this series is just missing the mark for me.Sal is coming to terms with the fact that she is no longer human. Her human host Sally died in the car accident she was recovering from in the first book (Parasite) and the tapeworm Sal has taken over. While Sal is reeling from this news, the world outside is falling apart. Sleepwalkers, including more aggressive variants, are taking over humanity completely. Sal and her boyfriend Nathan (who is a parasitologist) are working with Nathan\u2019s mom, Shanti, to try and figure out how to stop this crisis and save humanity. Shanti is one of the scientists who helped to develop that tapeworm implants to cure disease in humanity.I will start out by saying that the first book in this series, Parasite, was my least favorite book by Mira Grant/Seanan McGuire (although I still thought the story for that one was decent). This book was worse than Parasite. It is long and it feels long. It is also very wordy and the same ideas/concerns are rehashed over and over again. It is still readable and decently written. There were just too many plot inconsistencies and the books is way, way too wordy. It's like the story doesn't know whether to be an action-packed zombie novel or a philosophical discussion on the ills of science/medicine gone awry. It teeters in the middle and ends up being pretty bad at both. There is also this strange power struggle going on between the three scientists that helped develop SymboGen\u2019s tapeworm. It\u2019s like all three scientists want to play God and so they like to jerk each other around a lot while humanity dies around them. Honestly it comes off as an obnoxious medical drama of sorts.I found myself skimming portions of the story and then going back to reread them to make sure I hadn't missed anything (I hadn't). Vast portions of this book could have been left out and the story would have been better for it. I am not sure what happened here, but this is a bloated book. It is a book I did not enjoy written by an author I thought could do no wrong. I am very disappointed. It is still readable and there are sections and ideas within this book that are interesting. But, wow, this book needed some cuts and some editing before publishing.Okay enough complaining...well okay there might be some more complaining. I have had trouble with the whole concept of this series right from the beginning. The idea that vast portions of humanity would allow themselves to be infected with a tapeworm to prevent disease is just..well...really unlikely. People are incredibly stubborn and incredibly protective of their bodies. It\u2019s taken a lot for me to set all that aside and accept that \u201cyes, of course everyone would get tapeworms implanted\u201d. The confusion comes in with the Sleepwalkers and the more aggressive tapeworms. There seems to be kind of two types of people infected, or maybe they are going through stages? It\u2019s just all very confusing. People without tapeworm implants are not supposed to be infected, because it\u2019s not an infection it\u2019s a parasite. So I am still a bit confused about how cities are collapsing if only people with tapeworms are getting taken over. What is everyone who doesn\u2019t have a tapeworm doing? Also why do they need the dogs to sniff out sleepwalkers? Aren\u2019t they noisily moaning all the time? Or do only the active ones moan and the other ones need to be sniffed out? So confused...All that confusion aside... let\u2019s talk about our two main characters Sal and Nathan. Sal (Sally) has been a very confusing character. She is constantly passing out (we are given a reason for that finally in this book), she seems both too naive and too ruthless at times. In the last book she was supposedly still human but at the end of that book we find out she\u2019s not. Now she\u2019s getting used to be a tapeworm living in human skin. Okay I kind of get all that. Then in the second half of this book they are all like \u201cOh, but maybe you ARE still human too!\u201d Okay make up your mind and get on with the story...I am totally losing interest here\u2026I do enjoy some of the ideas behind the story. I also enjoy the research that must have been done to write this book, there is interesting information on parasitology and genetics in here. Additionally I enjoy the relationship that Nathan and Sal have; it is one based on mutual respect and trust. Overall parts of this book were okay but I did not enjoy the majority of it. The book is too wordy, too slow, and too long. There is too much back and forth in the plot and too much rehashing of the same ideas over and over. The characters are inconsistent and the side plots about scientist power struggles are too dramatic and preachy. I haven\u2019t enjoyed our main character and am having a really hard time with the main premise of the whole series (that vast portions of humanity would allow parasite to be implanted into their bodies). I would recommend reading Grant\u2019s Newsflesh series but would recommend skipping this one.

On the other, though, it did disappoint me. After loving Parasite on my reread, I find myself back here, once again disappointed in Parasitology. Newsflesh is pure perfection, and this series is not managing to achieve that magic again. Symbiont is clunky and second book syndrome all the way.For one thing, not much that\u2019s plot essential really happens in Symbiont. The whole book is plotting fail level video game, where Sal is always either on a mission to save someone or being kidnapped and needing to escape. She always has a clear goal to accomplish, but by doing so the larger plot is barely moved forward. Honestly, where Sal is at the end of Parasite is not very far from where she starts out in Chimera. It could have been a couple of chapters rather than a 500 page book.The other thing that really annoyed me about Symbiont is how much recapping there was. I really didn\u2019t need to bother rereading Parasite, though I\u2019m still glad I did, because she explained absolutely everything you missed. That\u2019s handy if you didn\u2019t just read the first book but annoying as heck if you did. Even worse, there\u2019s a lot of repetition. Both the recapping and new information get told to the reader more than once. For example, Sal\u2019s fear of cars is explained (a miss in the first book) two or three times, rather than just the one time needed for me to know about it.I mean, I enjoyed it. Grant\u2019s funny in a dark way, and I do care about the characters a lot. The saving grace of this installment was Ronnie. Not so much because I liked his character, as he\u2019s not really a character you\u2019re meant to like. However, Ronnie\u2019s a tapeworm in a female body who believes he\u2019s meant to be in a male body. Grant gets into a lot of gender identity stuff here and I really love her treatment of it.I\u2019m glad to be reading the Parasitology series, but it pales in comparison to Newsflesh.

And all I can say is that if you look at a duology and think, \"What this really needs is an extra 500 pages of absolutely nothing happening so we can sell more copies,\" then you really deserve nothing more than some highly critical and disappointed reviews. Most of the time, the middle book in a trilogy serves as a bridge and connects the action between the first and last book. Skilled writers will at least make the middle book worth reading. The middle book of Mira Grant's Newsflesh trilogy was especially worth reading, so I know she's capable of it. But literally nothing happened in this book that moved the narrative forward. Nothing new was revealed, nothing happened that could set up action further down the road. There was no interesting character development or world building. The main character goes from running for her life to being held captive to running for her life to being held captive. Somehow she does this with pluck even after two back-to-back brain surgeries. Other characters make bizarre decisions like saving potted plants when they're trying to narrowly escape from being eaten by tapeworm zombies. I still plan on reading the final book in the trilogy in hopes that the author and publisher shoved all the unnecessary crap into this one and moved on to where the story was supposed to go in the first place. Plus, I like Mira Grant and it pains me that this stinker is out there with her name on it."}, {"userName": "B.R.

Beyond the obvious intent of the character, she quite frequently takes two steps forward in one scene, then anywhere from 1-5 steps back in another scene. I found this immensely frustrating and exhausting to read (and lacking the smooth progression of the character in Parasite).-There's repetition in the story, both at the paragraph level, and the chapter level. There are things repeated multiple times within paragraphs of each other, and things repeated chapter-over-chapter. It felt like filler, and that is so not Mira Grant's style (at least, I don't recall that from previous books).-Diction and expanded vocabulary were kinda rammed down our throats in an awkward way. Grant's style often lends itself to learning new words, which is all well and good, but it was on overdrive this time (\"denuded\"?).-Because of the repetition I felt like this 396 page (cover-to-cover) book could have been <200, which means I'm second-guessing the $13 price tag on the eBook. I paid that much because it's Mira Grant, and it's Parasitology #2, and it's the Queen of (what I dubbed) Microbiological Thrillers.

(It's a trilogy now sigh). I think I'm gonna have to copy paste the whole thing since this shit is still stuck on yet another freaking cliffhanger! Arrrggghhh!Also, that awkward moment when you realize that even a tapeworm has a boyfriend but you don't.This sad pathetic forever alone life.Moving on to the actual review now.This is the book where the shit gets real. The tapeworms have taken over the world and it's the ultimate zombie apocalypse. Have I ever mentioned that I love zombies? I do, though I'm bat shit scared of them at the same time. I strongly believe I will be either one of the firsts to turn into one (Because I'm stupid enough to stand to watch the zombies since I'm fascinated by them and then get bitten by one) or one of the lasts (Since with my luck that's even more understandable because how else would the earth's balance be justified if I don't run around like a headless chicken scared outta my pants because zombies are after me?).Okay got a little distracted there. Zombies man!Truth be told, I can't really write reviews unless I hate the book (I excel at ranting) and that wasn't the case for this one. It was enjoyable. I generally tend to avoid lengthier books since I forget about the plot and characters if I can't read it in one setting (I blame my short term memory span). This was a lengthy book and I had to read it over a period of 3 days (Random fact about me that nobody in GR cares about: I have MBA classes now and need to get up at 6:45 in the morning). The fact that I still read it is indication that it was a good read (But then again, zombies!). Are you convinced by my faulty proved version of hypothesis yet or do I need to ramble some more?Long story short, read this book if you're into zombies, but I'll recommend you to do so once the last one comes out because I know for a fact that I'll forget half the things from this book when the last one comes out (Because that's what I do) and that sucks big time.P.S. Got carried away as usual. I still don't like Sally much, it's like she's just there and she doesn't evolve. Thankfully the plot's strong enough that it doesn't bother me as much as it would've if the plot was weak. Another thing that I cannot fathom is Sally's sorrow for the zombies. I get that they are her 'Cousins' but at the same time I don't (Makes perfect sense haha.

All the science and the tapeworms and ethical issues were simply fascinating and made me love the book so much! Nope, the reason for my to think of the book as creepy is because of two characters: Sherman and Dr Banks, two guys that appear to be on opposite sides but that have more in common that you'd even expect at first. Both simply are monsters, stopping at anything to achieve their goals, however different they are, the ways they go about it are disturbingly similar.The apocalypse has started, everything seems to be collapsing and no one knows how to react or how to stop what's happening, and to complicate things, these are NOT your regular zombies, they are not who they were before but could they be considered people with their implants? Are chimera people? What defines a person? are humans better just for the mere fact of being human? The amount of food for thought and ethical questions this book raises is amazing and I cannot help but highly recommend it to everyone that wants some deep substance in their books but also want some action and creepiness and zombies!Also, as a dog lover having them fight and ensure both pups were safe and cared for was something that I simply loved! And I love how Sal actually said to Dr Banks that to her Beverly was more of a person than he was. I'm finding it hard to say much more about the book without spoiling something or revealing something, so I'll just say that I highly recommend this book and the entire series and I cannot wait till Chimera is out next year!

Symbiont, book two of the trilogy that was supposed to be a duology is a little more of the same and a whole lot of nothing.Mira Grant is one of my favorite authors today and it is funny how it worked out. You see, I pretty much hated Feed, book one in the Newsflesh series, that is until I decided to read it for a second time months later. Upon my reread and my dissection of the writing style of Mira Grant I came to realize how special it is. How it paints the feel of communication today. How it \"fleshed\" out her characters and made me love them. The Newsflesh trilogy is simply not to be missed as it is unique in this over saturated zombie genre. Knowing that I loved the Newsflesh series so much I approached this series with apprehension and I wasn't sure if I was going to read it at all. Since book two was already out I decided to pick both up and give it a go. I enjoyed Parasite, even with it's flaws. All of Grant's style, wit, and paving is packed into those pages. Symbiont really is lacking of all those positives and instead really doesn't move the story along. What I really have come to loathe is the decision after decision from supposedly intelligent people to do exactly what you should never do. Let's see, hmm the world is ending and I am not sure we can make it to the car but let me get my plants. How about should we go to the lab it is probably a trap...yep a trap. Should I trust the guy that lies to me....yep and you know what...He lies. It started to come across as pathetic and I was feeling that maybe Sal should just get kill herself and end it.I enjoyed the writing and the style way more than I liked this book. I hated how it ended. If the final book doesn't contain a surprise miracle or two, this series will be toast. That being said I am glad that I read this one, I just feel that Grant let us and Sal down.If you have not read Mira Grant than do yourself a favor and pick up Feed book number 1 of the Newsflesh series....read them first, than come back to this one.I love Mira Grant."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie", "userReview": "Tansy\u2019s story is shocking and heart-breaking. Her viewpoints are probably the most powerful parts of this story, even if they are limited. The world Sal now lives in is starting to become very cruel indeed and there\u2019s some hard to swallow scenes. Fishy, new to the scene, is delusional, refusing to accept the apocalypse is really happening and he thinks he\u2019s just inside a video game. In some of the final chapters, this becomes endearing and also made me chuckle in the face of imminent doom.Without giving too much away, I loved the parts that were set in an abandoned chocolate factory that was kitted out to resemble Wonka\u2019s. Apocalyptic tales are usually full of derelict buildings and a limited colour palette. It\u2019s such fun to put in such a contrasting location. There were others living in a mall that gave a nod to Dawn of the Dead.The sleepwalkers may not technically be zombies, but Symbiont feels much more like a zombie story than Parasite did. The tapeworms are driven by hunger, and they might nosh down on the healthy, but they are killable and they will starve. There\u2019s a point where, through Sal\u2019s eyes, you start to feel pity towards them. They\u2019re not evil monsters intent on destroying humanity, unlike some people she knows. They are simply confused and starving.My main gripe about Symbiont that meant it didn\u2019t quite live up to Parasite, was what felt like a lack of editing. There\u2019s a lot of repetition in Sal\u2019s thoughts, going over and over how she has her phobia of cars and it was all SymboGen\u2019s fault. She also keeps telling us how she came to be. If you\u2019re halfway through the second book and haven\u2019t grasped that yet, you\u2019re really not paying attention. I think it would have been a lot stronger book if it were 100 pages shorter.I\u2019m starting to tire a little of Sal but I love the world and many of the supporting characters. The idea of tapeworms being gender neutral gives Mira Grant a chance to incorporate a trans character. Someone who is trapped inside a female body feeling that they are male. I also loved the dogs continued presence by Sal\u2019s side. Just because it\u2019s the end of the world, doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not time for doggy affection."}, {"userName": "Sarah (A Weebish Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24314165-sarah-a-weebish-book-blog", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on One Curvy Blogger\nI received this book for free from Publisher in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.Y\u2019all know I have been a huge fan of Mira Grant ever since I devoured the Newsflesh trilogy. So when the opportunity came to read and review Symbiont, I was so excited! I quickly snapped up the chance and boy am I glad. Just when I think Mira Grant can\u2019t get any creepier, she proves me wrong in all the best ways. I am blown away by every book Grant writes and it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for me to review her books. It so hard for me to express how awesome sauce her writing is, but I\u2019m going to give it a shot regardless.The implant takeovers are no longer isolated incidences, tapeworms everywhere are waking up and taking over their hosts. Sleepwalker hordes quickly gain control of San Francisco. For Sal and the group, the sleepwalkers are the least of their problems as they search for the how and the why while the government, evil scientists and other tapeworms are making the odds of surviving this man-made apocalypse slimmer than ever.The world building in Symbiont was once again phenomenal. We gain some valuable insights into why the tapeworms are taking over the hosts and are finally given some long-awaited answers, but with every answer that is uncovered, more questions are raised. This is how Grant keeps me on my toes and I can\u2019t help but love every minute of it.Symbiont was a wonderfully creepy, hair-raising installment in the parasitology series. The characters are even more heartbreaking, the science even more chilling and the plot is as intense as ever. I\u2019m so terrified to see what awaits me in Chimera but I can\u2019t wait to dig in.

Parasite hung on a plot point that was obvious to me within the first couple pages and then spent the entire novel bringing it's heroine to a realization of what I'd known from the very beginning. But, with that realization finally out of the way, I was hopeful that Symbiont could actually move things forward and into more unknown territory.Symbiont pays off, I'm glad to say. It's a far more enjoyable book than Parasite, even with it's unfinished, cliffhanger, this-is-the-middle-book ending. With Sal as a more cognizant character, there's less coy distribution of information and Sal is able to exercise some agency on her own behalf, both of which are incredibly welcome. I also enjoyed the secondary characters far more in Symbiont than I did in Parasite. Tansy felt too much like a retread of a character we've seen in all/most of Grant/McGuire's books, but I really enjoyed meeting Ronnie and Fishy and having Sal encounter the real Sherman and Dr. Banks (sidenote: I was a HUGE fan of the comedian Steven Banks, who was \"popular\" for a hot second in the late 80s/early 90s and it was HUGELY CONFUSING to have Steven Banks as a antagonist/villain in these books) and Colonel Mitchell.As well, I'm excited to be back in territory where I don't know what Grant is going to do next or the direction she plans to go with the final volume. Part of what made Parasite so boring for me was knowing exactly where the book was going from the first pages, but Symbiont was much more opaque and surprising and I have high hopes that Chimera, the third book, will be the same."}], "description": "THE SECOND BOOK IN MIRA GRANT'S TERRIFYING PARASITOLOGY SERIES.THE ENEMY IS INSIDE US.The SymboGen designed tapeworms were created to relieve humanity of disease and sickness.
