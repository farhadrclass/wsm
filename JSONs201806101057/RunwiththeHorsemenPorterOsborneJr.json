Porter Osbourne should go down as one of the classic characters not just in Southern Lit, but in literature in general. The first book is as a good a rumination on adolescent male sexuality as Roth's \"Portnoy's Complaint,\" and also examines race relations and generational distance in the agrarian early-20th century South. The second find Porter disillusioned with life and medical school, as well as losing his virginity to the unforgettable Vashti. The third sees him going off to war. Admittedly, the final chapter in this trilogy isn't up to par with the first two--it's a bit far-fetched and tries to make too many connections--but it's still damn good. Overall, this trilogy is story-telling at its best. It's funny, poignant, and action-packed. These books consumed my life. For two whole weeks I could think of nothing else. Great stuff."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7899124-lisa", "userReview": "I read this series when I was in my early teens, I believe. It recently popped back into my head, so I thought I'd see if I still enjoyed it. I think I appreciate it more now, because I can see the adult humor in it. Ferrol Sams uses such beautiful language to describe Georgia between Reconstruction and WWII, the relationships between the landowners and their dependents and the virtures of being Raised Right.I found it fascinating that we do not find out our protagonist's name until page 65, before then he is \"the boy\". These descriptors are used heavily throughout the beginning of the book as Sams builds his world and introduces us to the quirks of personality of the individuals who inhabit it. The father, the grandmother, the grandfather, the mother... they are introduced to us by their actions and history before we ever learn their names.I'm looking forward to reading the next two books again,as there are certain things I think I remember and I'm hoping the boy is as clever as he was."}, {"userName": "Teeliles", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1474246-teeliles", "userReview": "One of my favorite books, I've re-read this so many times I've lost count! By the author of Forrest Gump, Run With The Horsemen is the coming-of-age story of \"Little Porter\" Osbourne, the son of a Georgia farming family growing up during the Depression. The genteel, long-suffering mother (who strikes fear in the hearts of her husband and son with the words \"I'm not mad, I'm just hurt\"); the patrician lawyer father who the boy adores and lives to impress, even though aware of (and often teased for) Porter Sr.'s reputation for drinking and carousing; all of the characters ring just completely true. Especially, I imagine, for those of us who were raised in small Southern towns. The author doesn't sugar-coat the state of race relations during that era, but deals with the issue as simply another fact of life for those times. Sweet, sometimes sad, but often lough-out-loud funny! Highly recommended reading!"}, {"userName": "Jenn  Marx", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1267293-jenn-marx", "userReview": "Since I have moved to Georgia, I have been wanting to read a book that submerses me in the southern culture to help me acclamate. This book was given to me by a friend who grew up in the deep south that thought it would do the trick. It reminded me of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN--but about a boy, set in the deep south, and not as tragic. I fell in love with this protagonist, the hired \"colored-folk\" that worked his pa's farms, and his flawed family. It was a delight of a book.

It captures with brutal accuracy the Deep South at the onset of the Great Depression. It reveals the reality of the times and would be what one would see had he a time machine to travel back to these days. Porter Osborne, intelligent, humorous, and perceptive, yet, na\u00efve, is the bridge between the cultures.

Alongside To Kill a Mockingbird, which is the best of the best, I think that Run With the Horsemen comes in a close second, with two differences being that it is the boy's story without having a heroic father as counterpoint (although his father is certainly central to the plot), and it was a bit raunchier in the telling. The writing is wonderful, so descriptive, so funny at times, so interesting regarding life on a Georgia farm during the Depression. And the unresolved ending has me champing at the bit to read the sequel (The Whisper of the River). This was classic writing at its best. Favorite scenes: the boy attending church with Ole John Tom and the black community, and the junior-senior prom at school. Really well done. Kudos to Ferroll Sams."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1023188-lyn", "userReview": "The boy is endearing, precocious, funny, and at the same time forever trying to measure up to his father's expectations. A must-read series if you love Southern coming-of-age. Incidentally, I have attended a couple of book-signings by Ferrol Sams, and the man is amazing. He's not a quick scribbler, but actually spends a half-minute or so talking to each reader, then...BAM! writes a perfect line or two in your book, like he's known you forever. Snap!"}, {"userName": "George Bradford", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/935150-george-bradford", "userReview": "Run with the Horsemen is a wonderful book. It's a terrific story with a fascinating central character. And it captures all the aspects of life in rural Georgia during the Great Depression.It took me a while to get into the story. The narrator writes in the past tense, refers to himself in the third person (\"the boy\" aka Porter Osborne, Jr.) and the sentences run long. But I adjusted to the prose and was rewarded for the effort. This first volume of Porter's life story spans from childhood through high school graduation. Along the way there are enough adventures, dramas and historical asides to keep the narrative lively and fresh.Porter struggles with his peers, mother, himself, teachers, girls, the Lord and most of all his father. He deals with issues of race, social status, gender, faith and family. And he invariably emerges from these tests on the side of truth, fairness and justice.There's not a lot of high literary art in this novel. But there is one fascinating aspect of the story the author uses to great effect. As little Porter 'grows up' he obsesses with his diminutive size and failure to physically mature. Simultaneously, his emotional, intellectual and spiritual growth is exponential. By the end of the story Porter Osborne Jr. is a mountain of a man. When the reader learns that this mountain of a man stands no more than four feet ten inches tall and weighs a mere ninety pounds, it illuminates the wisdom shared by two different characters in the book (one at the beginning and the other at the end): \"It's not the dog in the fight, it's the fight in the dog.\" With Run with the Horsemen\" author Farrell Sams has contributed a solid book to the shelf of Southern Literature. Run with the Horsemen compares favorably to the works of southern authors Willie Morris, Truman Capote and Rick Bragg. In fact, I enjoyed Run with the Horseman so much that as soon as I finished reading it I went directly to my local use book store and purchased a copy of The Whisper of the River so I can follow Porter Osborne Jr.'s continuing story as he leaves home and goes off to college. Run with the Horsemen is a wonderful book."}, {"userName": "brian dean", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1888911-brian-dean", "userReview": "This is an great book on its own but I have just finished rereading \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and I was interested in comparing the two books. Really, the big similarity is how they try to explain how white Southerners treated blacks during the depression. Both have a lot of \"this is the culture, this is how it has always been done\".Although both books have a strong, educated father who is in the government, and both deal with the relationship of the children and their fathers, Run with the Horsemen's father is the oppisite of Atticus Finch in many ways. He is a heavey-drinking, violent man redeemed mostly by his uncompromising sense of justice.Run with the Horsemen's protagonist is a teenage boy and much of the book deals with his becoming a man, learning about sex and understanding his father.To Kill a Mockingbird is far more inspiring but Run with the Horsemen stands up well beside it.Added much later: I have been thinking about rereading this book but find there is no 'e-book' version. I guess the book has staying power.There is an interview of Ferrol Sams in the Korea Herald:http://view.koreaherald.com/kh/view.p..."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1956252-nancy", "userReview": "This book is set in the south in the same era as \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d and is both funny and poignant as it explores the relationship between the races through the eyes of the protagonist, Porter Osborne III, a bright, sensitive boy growing up on a farm in Georgia.

At first I read it because my parents and grandmother had both read this book and spoke very highly off it; and now that I have already finished, I agree. The characters are very life like and, as it is with most books, the reader gets lost in the story and forgets that the characters, ocurrences and places in the book are fictional! I hardily approve with the title as it is very meaningful and I feel that it sums the story up very well as Porter, or Sambo as he is reffered to by most people in the story, always seems to be chasing something; be it his father's approval, acceptance from his teachers or an award for debate or speech making.As well as being quite intelligent and prestigios in school, sambo is very naughty around the farm, leaving quite a humourous mark on the book. Although he always means well, he is quite a prankster. After he lit a mule's fart on fire trying to make it plow faster and to stop being ornery, his father summed the situation up to one of his friends, \"He's not a bad boy, I just can't think of everything to tell him not to do.\"In my opinion, Ferrol Sams' writing style suits the context perfectly. Written in a light-hearted manor that makes even the most serious of situations funnny, this book tackles issues such as pride and poverty in the Great Deppression is a way that keeps the reader interested to the final pages! I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction books that are well written with challenging vocabulary entwined into every page."}, {"userName": "Tony Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5839924-tony-smith", "userReview": "Run with the Horsemen is a must read for any Southerner or anyone who has enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird.

Their strengths and weaknesses are played out wonderfully throughout the story. The reason I'm giving the book 3 stars is because I didn't like how much of it was written with the characters identified by such impersonal tags, as the boy, the father, the grandfather, etc. At one point, I honestly wondered if I was going to get names to the individual characters. I didn't like how the dialog was written for the white characters, versus their black counterparts. This is the deep South, during the Great Depression, and both whites and blacks would, and do, speak with a thick regional accent. Despite this fact, the black characters dialog is phoenitically spelled out, while the dialog of the main white characters bears almost no regional accent distinction. Finally, the novel took too much time to lay out the ground work for the relationship between the boy and his father, and I struggled through the first 80 or so pages. I was ready to write it off and give it a 1 star rating, but because this was for book club, I stuck with it; my goal being to read at least 100 pages.

The Boy is the only son of a refined and long-suffering mother and an alcoholic, politically connected father. He is smart and resourceful, but confused about much of the information that he gathers by eavesdropping on the adults on and around the farm. He frequently feels alone, in part because he has only sisters, but also because he is so small compared to his classmates. The book covers his story from early childhood through high school. The style of writing is somewhat stilted and distant. I had a hard time connecting to the boy and his circumstances. However, about 1/3 of the way through the book I grew to really enjoy the story of his journey to young adulthood. There are laugh-out-loud escapades, moments of tender young love, and scenes of horrible corporal punishment (which was wide spread and tolerated both at home and at school during that era).

The African American people are no longer in slavery but many continued to work on the farms where their ancestors had been in slavery. They were good, even best, friends with the main character. The main character tried really hard to do well in school and overcome the fact that he was one of the smallest students in the entire school. The author, almost throughout, referred to the main character as 'the boy'. Personally, I found this annoying. I couldn't ever remember his name as it showed up only rarely. His sister was referred to as 'the sister', his mom as 'the mother', ad naseum. I would not recommend this book. It is the first book of a trilogy. I will not read the other two, despite having been left hanging after one of 'the father's' drunken escapades. The author, perhaps in consideration of the age of 'the boy', had many passages about copulation, early adolescent exploration, and whether or not various characters had reached puberty.

There were soooo many things I liked, the way he looked up and down to his dad, the clever way he dealt with situations...like going to the Education Board. The bees in the auditorium, and further that with the cashing the paycheck in coins and describing it as a treasure...priceless revenge.
