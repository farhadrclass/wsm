I thought this one was better written than Hound Dog Man. Gipson reminds me very much of Jesse Stuart with his descriptions of the countryside. I liked the characters in this book; the children seemed childlike, and the grandfather character was also believable. My father would have loved Gipson's descriptions of post hole digging. All in all, a good read."}, {"userName": "Candice", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3346764-candice", "userReview": "Great setting and details, would have liked it to been longer I enjoyed it so much"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14098700-stephanie", "userReview": "This book was full of too many \"tarnations\" and \"hot-diggitys\" for my taste.
