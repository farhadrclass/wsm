She also wondered how long until she found out everything.Ivy had been found near death at the old homestead, Carrowmore, underneath a rotting staircase.Carrowmore had been a favorite childhood place of her mother and her friends where they put \"wishes on ribbons\" into the opening of a tree.As the book continued, the plot thickened, and Larkin kept finding out more and more about what had been kept from her and how some close family members were not as they appeared.DREAMS OF FALLING was a bit confusing at first in the character department. It took me a while to figure out who belonged to who and what their connections were. The connections became more tricky and quite intriguing as things were revealed.We learn of the secrets kept and of the lives of the main characters by going back to 1951 and then returning to 2010. I really enjoyed seeing the three friends in their youth. Their current lives didn\u2019t seem as exciting, but their youth and family history as with all of us had a major influence on their lives now and the paths they had chosen.DREAMS OF FALLING started out not feeling like Karen White\u2019s usual books because of the confusing character problem, but once the book got going, the familiar writing, the marvelous story line, the Southern charm, and warm characters made its appearance and made the story line completely wonderful and enjoyable as always.DREAMS OF FALLING is another marvelous treat. Despite the confusion with the characters at the beginning, DREAMS OF FALLING is another Karen White masterpiece that pulls you in and keeps you loving each turn of the page.I hope you enjoy it too. 5/5I received an Advanced Reader of this book.

Margaret, Ceecee and Bitty placed that ribbon in the opening of a special moss-covered tree on the banks of the North Santee River. No one could have imagined what that promise would mean.Larkin had fled Georgetown, South Carolina nine years ago. She vowed never to return, but when she hears that her mother, Ivy has disappeared, she has to go back. She returns to the place that she both loves and hates, and to the family and friends that have missed her tremendously. Not long after her arrival, Larkin finds Ivy unconscious in the ruins of her family\u2019s abandon plantation house. She had fallen through the rotten floor boards and her arm was at a funny angle. Carrowmore, a Greek Revival mansion, had burnt to the ground over fifty years ago. No one knows why Ivy had gone there. As Larkin digs for answers, she uncovers secrets that lead back to three 18-year-old girls and an unchaperoned graduation trip to Myrtle Beach. That trip and it\u2019s aftermath and the secrets that resulted would test their friendships and change each of their lives forever. REVIEWBe careful what you wish for. DREAMS of FALLING may having you thinking carefully about your next birthday wish. The story is dramatic and cleverly layered and there are tons of great characters. Most notably are the three best friends: the beautiful and rich Margaret; CeeCee, the preacher\u2019s daughter; and the always smoking and red-headed artist, Bitty. Each one of them is flawed in their own way. As a matter of fact, practically all of the characters in the book are flawed in one way or another. And that is precisely what makes this book so real. The story is built on secrets. Secrets that will make you mad, secrets that will astonish you, and secrets that will devastate you. KAREN WHITE\u2019s entertaining and fluid writing will draw you in and only give you a moment to catch your breath before catapulting you to another time. Chapters alternate between Ivy, Larkin and CeeCee, with CeeCee\u2019s chapters splitting time between 1951 and 2010. My favorite part of the book were CeeCee\u2019s chapters about the trip to Myrtle Beach in May 1951. The champagne, the dancing, the boardwalk, the carousel, and walking on the beach with a handsome man under a star-filled sky...some dreams really do come true. Lovers of Southern women\u2019s fiction will appreciate this dramatic story by an author that knows her way around a keyboard. KAREN WHITE is the author of well over twenty novels.

Awesome story.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~When you have read the same author stories multiple times you tend to expect the same type of story that you\u2019ve gotten in the past. That is not unusual and that\u2019s what I was thinking when I open this book.However, I could not have been more wrong.This book started out in a traditional manner. I\u2019m not sure where it was in the story that things started to change for me. However, it didn\u2019t take long for me to become so connected and one with the story that I simply could not stop reading.I\u2019m not sure who I identified with most. There are multiple characters in this book \u2013 best friends whose friendship had broken years ago; best friends who still watch out and take care of each other 50 years later. Or maybe it was the parents who hid secrets that would change someone\u2019s life.Karen White is a master at telling and crafting an amazing story. Words truly escape me on how to describe the feelings I got with this book. I would read page after page with tears just coming down. My heart broken for what could\u2019ve been, what should\u2019ve been. Deep emotion, surprising twists, and even things that I knew were going happen and did, still got to me.Intense, touching, sweet \u2013 this is the story about love on many different levels and true friendship that lasts the test of time.If you have not read a story by Karen White, this is the one you\u2019ve been waiting for. Do yourself a favor and block out an entire day to read this book.

There is family drama, secrets between friends, good old fashioned southern charm, romance and even a historical feel as some chapters flip back to the fifties.This follows a family of women and the Darlington\u2019s and Margaret Darlington\u2019s two best friends, Ceecee and Bitty. Those two were my favorite, they share a long history and not much of it is happy, but theirs is a friendship based on true loyalty and love which is something you don\u2019t see much of nowadays. They snipe and snark at each other as only old, true friends can and as more of their story was revealed I found myself liking them that much more.I was never exactly sure what old secrets were trying to come to light, I had some ideas but never had things totally figured out. There was so much pain between these women, loss heartbreak and betrayal, but I loved how they stood by each other and any mistakes they made were done with only the purest of intentions. I think this will be a popular book club choice because it will satisfy so many different readers, if you\u2019re a fan of White I think you\u2019ll enjoy this immensely.Dreams of Falling in three words: Captivating, Moving and Charming."}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "Family bonds and secrets are at the heart of Dreams of Falling.

In her latest book \u201cDreams of Falling\u201d she offers us two generations of strong female friendships. After nine years away, Larkin returns to her childhood home in South Carolina when her mother Ivy takes a life-threatening fall, a fall that becomes the catalyst for exposing long held secrets. Larkin had fled her home insisting she would never return. When Ivy is found in the burned out ruins of her family\u2019s ancestral home, unconscious and badly injured, Larkin becomes determined to find out why her mother was there. It is in this search that Larkin uncovers the secrets kept by three teenage friends who fifty years earlier had sworn to remain best friends forever, never imagining the heartache that would result from that vow.I admired the strength of the friendships in this story \u2013 the older generation (Margaret, Ceecee, and Bitty) and the younger generation (Larkin, Mabry, and Bennett). Their love for and loyalty to each other is so strong that they keep secrets to protect those they love. Just as the older generation had their secrets, so too do the younger friends Larkin, Mabry, and Bennett - secrets kept in an effort to protect one of them. But it seems that all secrets are at some point revealed, leading to unknown consequences. This is the true beauty of Karen White\u2019s writings \u2013 how do those who loved each other so strongly deal with consequences of those secrets. Ms. White reveals the flaws in each of her characters, making them more human. She artfully wove together the strands of the backstories, slowly revealing the puzzle pieces one at a time. As the story evolved I found myself asking/guessing what role each character played in the central event. When I reached the end of the story, I marveled at the beauty of the writing and how well, and naturally, it all came together.This is a story that tugged at my heart as the friends were dealt so much tragedy that normally would have destroyed friendships. Yet these friends stayed true. I loved the characters, laughing with them, crying with them, asking \u201cWhat were you thinking\u201d a few times, and so hoping that a little sunshine would fall into their lives. I do highly recommend this book.

One reason for this back and forth behavior was the soap opera-esque nature of this book. It really started to become boringly predictable and absurd. There was one distinct moment that I can recall thinking \"Please, don't go down that Days of Our Lives Road.... and you are taking that route\" Yet, honestly, the soap opera tone didn't seal my rating. I'll explain more below. What's It About: 27 year old Larkin escaped her life in Georgetown, South Carolina for a life she made for herself in New York. It's been nine years since she saw her close friends and family as she escaped and remade herself. When she gets the call her mother is missing. She returns home. Larkin discovers her mother on the floor of her family's old decrepit rice plantation home. With her mother lapsing into a coma; Larkin stays nearby anxiously waiting on her recovery. While waiting, she renews ties with her honorary mothers- Ceecee and Bitty who raised her lovingly. She also mends fences with two of her childhood friends that she hurt deeply on her leaving. When an old crush who rebuffed her in high school admires this \"new\" Larkin; she has a decision to make on where this \"new\" Larkin wants to head in her life. Larkin finds herself discovering buried family secrets, love, family, and also where her home is. My Thoughts:  Ugh. I hate to write them. In all honesty, I felt these were some of Karen White's weakest characters. In my defense, I'm a big fan and own all her books. Her House on Tradd Street series is one of my favorites- though the last one missed the mark for me as well. The characters in this book seemed superficial, convenient, or just not believable. I think two though that were wonderful are Ceecee and Bitty. The friendship between Ceecee and Bitty and their story was a highlight for me. However, Margaret, Larkin, and Ivy's stories just fell flat and needed cues for dramatic swelling music at times. The multigenerational storytelling and back and forth between past/present is a selling point for this book. White does that quite well.  The main character- Larkin. I just couldn't get behind her. She was all over the place and her issues are never really fleshed out. Except for her weight. The reader is treated to numerous references to her weight. I noticed in the last Tradd Street novel, White made weight an issue for the main character too. 18 year old Larkin was overweight and overate per the book. 27 year old Larkin has shed said weight, now can just wear a sports bra out on a boat, looks \"hot\", and chooses frozen yogurt over ice cream... or just follows a healthy portion size now. The reader gets this spelled out for them frequently; and not to worry, one of the love interests thought she looked great when she was overweight. It just became aggravating to me. Aggravating because we are experiencing a strong movement towards valuing women more for their appearance and this novel just gravitates more towards appearance than the substance of women. I just think the strong weight focus was tacky, unnecessary, and repeated too often in the novel. I would have rather learned how Larkin worked through her anger management issues. She mentioned she had a problem with her anger, especially after throwing a cooler at her best friend's head.  To Sum: I really don't want to hate on this book. I like Karen White's novels. I just found this one lacking compared to previous books. She eloquently writes about low country inlets with massive trees perfect for storing ribbon wishes in their trunks, boat rides to capture the sunrise, languid strolls on twilight it streets with ice cream in hand. You just either wish you were there or can envision yourself there with the characters. I truly think her images of the South are lovely and magical. I encourage you to read it for the images alone and the story is still entertaining. Just not my favorite.

While there might be some elements of predictability, I know that when I start the book, I'm going to be in for an enjoyable read. And as always the Southern setting plays an important role in the story, almost like an actual character in the book. I loved the alternating timelines and the different characters' point of view.

Found badly injured in the ruins of the family rice plantation, Ivy now lay comatose while her friends and family gather around her, each lost in their own thoughts of how she ended up where she is. Some know the answers, some will do anything to keep long-held secrets and some, like Larkin are clueless and demand answers.What Larkin will discover will expose decades of lies, betrayals and fierce loyalties, as she learns truths that were hidden from her for her entire life. Will these revelations finally free Larkin to be who she was meant to be and bring her home again?See through the eyes of numerous characters, jumping from past events to the present, even the thoughts of the comatose Ivy will be heard.What starts out promising to be a magnetic and intense read becomes a twisted soap opera that runs alternately as slow as molasses and fast as fire in the wind. Ms. White doesn\u2019t ask us to like her characters, she has made them flawed, deceitful and sometimes purely self-serving. There are those who are victims, those who are villains for the right reasons and those who never see beyond themselves.For me, this was a love it, hate it read that could get too bogged down in its own shocking twists that felt so jarring they seemed too ill-fitting and too over-the-top.

I've said this before, but I think we all have those special relationships that you know will last a lifetime. Books like this remind me of mine and how your closest friends are not just friends, but family. This book goes back and forth from past to present and seems to be giving the full story of these women and the secrets they keep. Throw in some southern charm and what can I say - I'm a happy camper. In every group, people play their role. There's always the rebel, the pretty one and the one who cared too much but never felt like the front runner. Here we find Bitty, Margaret and Ceecee respectively. Things are different in 1951 and the things friends sacrifice to help their friends are things we, today, probably wouldn't even consider. Especially the sense of honor in the South. White brings these aspects to the page graciously and I felt like I was in Georgetown with these ladies. Each character came to life and the pictures in my head were vivid with imagery. (I wanted to throat punch Jackson EVERY TIME he came into the picture and pictured Bennet as a Chris Pratt type \ud83d\ude0d). Larkin, who is lucky enough to have all of these women as (grand)mother figures, is still trying to find her way and coming back to her past she thought she had successfully ran away from opens up doors, eyes and hearts. While the secrets learned throughout the story weren't necessarily shocking.. they felt extremely REAL and HUMAN and that, for me, sometimes makes the book even better. Feel these women, what they've gone through and how they'll be \"friends forever\". It's true that sometimes jealousy can be ascribed to admiration. If you're superstitious at all, be very careful what you wish for - it just might come all too true.Highly recommend for those who love some historical, some romance and a lot of friendship.Thank you to Berkley for this copy <3"}, {"userName": "Wit & Wonder Books", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28111499-wit-wonder-books", "userReview": "***ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review***What a spellbinding, beautiful story Karen White has created in her newest novel, Dreams of Falling.

It's been nine years since she saw her close friends and family as she escaped and remade herself. When she gets the call her mother is missing. She returns home. Larkin discovers her mother on the floor of her family's old decrepit rice plantation home. With her mother lapsing into a coma; Larkin stays nearby anxiously waiting on her recovery. While waiting, she renews ties with her honorary mothers- Ceecee and Bitty who raised her lovingly. She also mends fences with two of her childhood friends that she hurt deeply on her leaving. When an old crush who rebuffed her in high school admires this \"new\" Larkin; she has a decision to make on where this \"new\" Larkin wants to head in her life. Larkin finds herself discovering buried family secrets, love, family, and also where her home is. My Thoughts:  Ugh. I hate to write them. In all honesty, I felt these were some of Karen White's weakest characters. In my defense, I'm a big fan and own all her books. Her House on Tradd Street series is one of my favorites- though the last one missed the mark for me as well. The characters in this book seemed superficial, convenient, or just not believable. I think two though that were wonderful are Ceecee and Bitty. The friendship between Ceecee and Bitty and their story was a highlight for me. However, Margaret, Larkin, and Ivy's stories just fell flat and needed cues for dramatic swelling music at times. The multigenerational storytelling and back and forth between past/present is a selling point for this book. White does that quite well.  The main character- Larkin. I just couldn't get behind her. She was all over the place and her issues are never really fleshed out. Except for her weight. The reader is treated to numerous references to her weight. I noticed in the last Tradd Street novel, White made weight an issue for the main character too. 18 year old Larkin was overweight and overate per the book. 27 year old Larkin has shed said weight, now can just wear a sports bra out on a boat, looks \"hot\", and chooses frozen yogurt over ice cream... or just follows a healthy portion size now. The reader gets this spelled out for them frequently; and not to worry, one of the love interests thought she looked great when she was overweight. It just became aggravating to me. Aggravating because we are experiencing a strong movement towards valuing women more for their appearance and this novel just gravitates more towards appearance than the substance of women. I just think the strong weight focus was tacky, unnecessary, and repeated too often in the novel. I would have rather learned how Larkin worked through her anger management issues. She mentioned she had a problem with her anger, especially after throwing a cooler at her best friend's head.  To Sum: I really don't want to hate on this book. I like Karen White's novels. I just found this one lacking compared to previous books. She eloquently writes about low country inlets with massive trees perfect for storing ribbon wishes in their trunks, boat rides to capture the sunrise, languid strolls on twilight it streets with ice cream in hand. You just either wish you were there or can envision yourself there with the characters. I truly think her images of the South are lovely and magical. I encourage you to read it for the images alone and the story is still entertaining. Just not my favorite. Thank you to Berkley and Netgalley for allowing me to read this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "*The Angry Reader*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/840454-the-angry-reader", "userReview": "***I received an ARC for an honest review***While I theoretically understood where the author was going here I didn't always love the execution. Larkin is living (hiding) in New York when her mother has an accident that forces her return to her southern hometown. Larkin is hurt because she feels those closest to her lied to her in an effort to make her seem perfect. From what I could gather her issue is that those that loved her filled her with compliments and confidence - and when that was tested she ran. There is a large cast here - Larkin, her mom Ivy (in a coma), the women who raised Ivy (and sort of raised Larkin) Ceecee and Bitty, Larkin's dead grandma Margaret, Larkin's friend Mabry and Mabry's twin Bennett. Plus some high school crush named Jackson. Lies pile on lies - told between best friends Margaret, CeeCee and Bitty (when we travel back to the early 1950s to watch their journey to adulthood together), and between literally everyone and Larkin. And Larkin and Mabry. And Larkin and Jackson. And Larkin and Bennett. There was sweetness and some eye-roll moments. I couldn't connect with Larkin - we were just too different. But I liked a number of the supporting characters. I found the story compelling enough to keep reading even though I sighed a few times.I liken this story to a shopping cart with a wiggly wheel. It got the job done, but it was awkward."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1758987-becky", "userReview": "4.5 StarsLoved this book, loved the \"magical\" feel to parts of it.It is the story of 3 young women in the early 50's, each very different from the other.

All opinions are my own. Dreams of Falling is a story about finding secrets buried in a great, big, twisty, southern family tree. Margaret, CeeCee and Bitty were best friends in the 1950's. As they grow up, CeeCee and Bitty help raise Margaret's little girl Ivy, and then continue on the tradition by helping to raise Ivy's little girl Larkin. The two women keep many secrets from Larkin about her childhood because they don't want to hurt her, but in the end Larkin is more hurt about being kept in the dark.The story alternates between the present day, with Larking searching for answers about how and why her mother was in the decrepit old plantation home, and the 1950's, where Maraget, CeeCee and Bitty are young women and make some mistakes that haunt them for the rest of their lives.I definitely found myself enjoying the historical sections better because there was more of a plot there. The sections in the present time weren't really going anywhere in my opinion. With that being said, this novel was extremely character driven which is not something I am a big fan of and is also not like Karen White's previous novels. Last year's The Night The Lights Went Out had a steady moving and multi-layered plot that read almost like a page-turning mystery.I also didn't like the subtle love interests in this novel. Romance is not a genre I enjoy, but I have always felt that Karen White is able to add romance into her novels in a very realistic way. Unfortunately in this novel, I found the love triangle to be clique' and unnatural.On a positive note, I can say that this novel provoked some deep thoughts about family and raising kids. Parenting can be so hard, and sometimes we make choices that we think are for the best. I was left wondering about choices I have made myself as a parent and whether or not the are the right choice. In the novel, CeeCee and Bitty doted on Larkin all her childhood to the point where she thought she was absolutely prefect. In retrospect, Larkin sees that that treatment effected not only her opinions of her self but how she interacted with other people. Being able to provoke thoughts is a quality I love in a book.Even though this was not my favorite from White, her writing remains very beautiful. She writes about southern life with the charm and eloquence you would expect from a southern belle. She builds great characters that keep alive that ole' south feeling. If you are a die hard Karen White fan, then you should definitely pick this one up, but if she is new to you maybe try one of her other titles. I rate this one 3 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1004125-tammy", "userReview": "I love Karen White's books and this one didn't disappoint!

She receives an unexpected phone call letting her know her mother (Ivy) has gone missing. Going back to Georgetown, where she fled from nine years ago, is the last place she wants to go, but she loves her mother and doesn\u2019t think twice about returning home to help find her.This is a story about three generations of women and is told from the perspective of Ceecee, Ivy, and Larkin. The main story is told in present day (2010) with flashbacks throughout to 1951. In these flashbacks, Ceecee, Bitty, and Margaret have just graduated from high school. These three best friends are young, ready to spread their wings, and want to find love. I initially found this story a bit confusing. It was a bit tricky keeping track of all the female characters, plus the younger and older versions of a couple of them. I did eventually get everyone straight in my head, so all was not lost.I found myself drawn to the 1951 storyline more than the present day storyline. I had trouble connecting with Larkin, I found her a bit too na\u00efve and immature. Although I didn\u2019t completely connect with Larkin, I was quite intrigued by what she was hiding and why she ran away from Georgetown so many years ago. It was nearly impossible for her secrets to remain hidden while being surrounded by her family and friends who all care so deeply for her.All of these women have their regrets and secrets that they\u2019d rather keep under lock and key. But secrets have a way of coming out. This book had many sweet moments, and lots of revelations. The love all of these women have for each other is beautiful. It shows how friendship can transcend for generations through the good and bad. They have all had their struggles and made mistakes, but they will always be there for one another.*Thank you NetGalley, Berkley Publishing Group, and Karen White for the opportunity to read and review this book for my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "This is my third book by this author and I am so happy to say that they have each touched me and thoroughly entertained me.I loved this saga of three generations of Darlington women and their very close friends.
