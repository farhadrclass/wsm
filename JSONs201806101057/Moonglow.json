Chabon unashamedly states its fictional roots and perhaps questions the concept of a factual memoir, how much of a memoir can be said to be true when peoples' memories are notoriously unreliable? Can a memoir be free from an agenda? How much is the truth embellished to create a compelling life history? How free is it from the desire to create a particular picture of an individual whilst diminishing or erasing other aspects? I came away from reading this feeling that in this case it barely matters which bricks of this fabled reconstruction of family history are true and which are false. What mattered to me is the warmth, passion, vibrancy, imagination and humour with which the web of stories are told, the love and affection that drive the need in the author to document his maternal grandfather's life as he is dying, serving the purpose of tangibly memorialising and honouring a life on the cusp of passing on. Particularly as his grandfather talks of his life amounting to little, the temporary nature of life and that whilst he was always starting things, he never finished them. I for one am not going to forget this book.I was entranced by the lyrical prose and the vivid metaphors in the narrative. The stories of efforts to strangle Alger Hiss with ripped out telephone cables which lands the grandfather in a New York prison, blowing up bridges, sex, war time espionage and efforts attempting to locate Nazi SS officer Wernher Von Braun in Europe only to find he ends up working for the US space programme, There is the obsession with rockets and a lovely story of the exploits of Ramon the cat and the hunt for the snake. It appears the outpouring of tales is chaotic and non linear, but this is often the nature of memory, going back and forth in time. What is particularly tender and heartbreaking is the recounting of the love and loyalty he has for Chabon's grandmother, her desperate and traumatic history and the consequent mental instability that ensued. There is the examination of what constitutes family with the inclusion of non blood family members.The exuberance of the prose render the novel never less than compelling reading. It matters not one whit if the entire book comprises of nothing but fiction. As you may have gathered I fell in love with Moonglow. A fantastic and moving read that I highly recommend.

Michael Chabon: I love your classy name - your books -and your wonderful talented -courageous wife: author Ayelet Waldman. So before I begin my review I have a few things to say local boy!I own every physical book - written - by 'both' Michael and Ayelet. --BAY AREA AUTHORS -- spotlight voices within the Jewish Community--- both bright - adorable - an inspiring married couple! I have a deep love for Ayelet. I feel a primal connection---( woman to woman - wife to wife - mother to mother - Jew to Jew). When Netgalley and Edelweiss- both- turned my request down for Moonglow and Ayelet's new 'soon-to-be-released' book, called, \"A Really Good Day: How Microdosing Made a Mega Difference in My Mood, My Marriage, and My Life\"....I kinda laughed. OF COURSE. ( Jewish Karma) I must own their PHYSICAL books. When I told Ayelet that I was turned down for an arc of her new book when I saw her a few weeks ago - she offered to step in and get a book to me .... I said ....\"don't, I can handle it\". \"I'll get a copy myself\". Thanks anyway, Ayelet. Can't wait to read her book, too. \"Moonglow\" -- fictional nonfiction\"--is a lovely physical book. I especially like the inside black & white moon artwork when you first open the book. It was easy to imagine Michael listening to his grandfathers final confessions--10 straight days before he died.....being privy to the lies, conflicts, and secrets, that his grandfather had kept secret.Underneath the humor, it was inevitably painful for his grandfather and grandmother to deal with pain, loss, grief upsets, death, suffering of any kind. They would avoid - or minimize -talking about anything that was negative. Instead they would lie to each other - hold onto secrets thinking it was their best option. Michael was able to see in those last ten days of his grandfathers life -- just how crushing his grandparents marriage really was at times due to all secrets & lies they both kept hidden. I appreciate Michael writing this book for a couple of reasons:  ......The more I read - it becomes clear how family bonds get stuck and pass down - generation to generation - behaviors that undercut & destroy relationships. Michael set out to change those patterns. The secrets are out of the bag....Terrific stories! Terrific storytelling. At the end of Michael's grandfathers life, his doctor prescribed a powerful hydromorphone against the pain of bone cancer. Michael begins his story by telling us what his grandfather was like as a child in South Philadelphia- a wild kid - who once threw a kitten out of a window. The storytelling jumps around - which slowed down my reading to be honest. I didn't mind - but several times I turned back pages to check dates....Was I in the 60's or 80's? The first 80-100 pages I read extra slow...It took me a little longer ( slow turd), to understand the importance \"Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel\", by Willy Ley - a favorite book of grandfather- was to him ... and just how big of a turning point that book might have been. Michael's grandfather, who normally drove to every shuttle firing--- had a silent boycott during the Apollo era --shocking his parents on July 20, 1969 after months of displaying fascination and excitement about the imminent manned landing on the moon, he had abruptly declined to join his family when the entire population of earth was watching Neil Armstrong fulfill the lifelong dream that Von Braun and his grandfather both shared. All he said was....\"the way they have done it is totally wrong\". Years later - he never wanted to miss a launch again!!!! I found Michael's grandfather fascinating!!! At times I was cracking up. His clothes - for example. Gramps ( I'm just going to call Michael's grandfather- Gramps from here on out).....was living in Florida after his wife died. His daily \"uniform\"....( so to speak), consisted of khaki shorts, one of seven he purchased at Kmart, to go with his one of seven polo shirts. On his feet he wore leather sandals, imitation Birkenstocks of Israeli manufacture with white tube socks. Paul, my husband, told me --- don't ever let me wear tube socks with sandals when I become an old man! ( cute....as this visual IS Paul's visual of BEING OLD). Other parts were sad: January 28, 1986- was the 11th yahrzeit of his wife's death -Michael's grandmother- and Gramps was at the grave in Pennsylvania. At the same time - same day - Tuesday - an O-ring failed at Cape Canaveral. The shuttle began to break apart. His grandfather did not know until he got back to his motor lodge.Michael called his grandfather that day- as soon as he heard the news....Gramps was saying \"Too goddamn cold\". \"36\u00b0 at launch. Idiot bureaucrats\". Michael and his grandfather talked about the cemetery ... Michael says, \"I know you miss her. I wish you were still here\". Gramps says, \"I'm glad she isn't. If she saw the mess her grave is, she be furious and she'd blame me. Because I insisted on that cemetery\". We learn as much about Michael's grandmother as we do his grandfather...Her fortune telling cards, The painful life she had growing up during the war, her mental illness, ( the private suffering), and a lot about their marriage together. I loved it .... and I couldn't help think about my own grandpa and grandma Cookie... Who lived in Oakland and were in a Jewish home late in life.I fully enjoyed the richness of family history - honesty- Jewish roots - and Michael's devotion to family. This book is a HUGE GIFT for the Jewish Community! Jewish Book clubs all over the states will be having discussions -I'll be reading this book again in the spring of 2017 with a group in the Bay Area This book was picked as THE BOOK of the YEAR for \"Jewish Learning\"....A project of the Jewish Community Library. Michael will be speaking all over the Bay Area in many months to come! Congratulations, Michael."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "4.5 stars Michael Charon has held a place in my literary heart ever since I read The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay and has insured that place with his latest book. Chabon's inspiration for the book were the stories his grandfather told while he was on pain killers and close to death. In his opening author's note, though he warns us that what we will soon be reading may not exactly be true. \" In preparing this memoir, I have stuck to the facts, except when facts refused to conform with memory, narrative purpose, or the truth as I prefer to understand it. Whatever liberties have been taken with names, dates, places, events, and conversations, or with the identities, motivations, and the interrelationships of family members and historical personages, the reader is assured that they have been taken with due abandon.\"For me, whether the stories and memories are totally true or partially imagined just didn't matter. I'll take them as they are , whatever they are because I felt they were told by Chabon with love and it felt like he had perhaps captured the essence of this history - his family's. His grandfather almost kills his boss, almost blows up a bridge, and is obsessed with rockets. The stories are funny and sad, and feel real , moving around times from the present, to before he met Chabon's grandmother, to his time in the war, arriving at Nordhausen concentration camp after the liberation, to their life together, to his time in prison, to the retirement community where his grandfather lived at the end of his life. While the changes in time and place aren't always seamless, the telling was very much like our memories, a little complex and not always in chronological order . I also loved when he tells of his grandmother and the stories she told him . Her story was a sad one as we learn of her past , her demons , and mental breakdowns. There were times when I asked myself where this narrative was going and the answer is straight to the heart . I felt at times, it was a little drawn out, thus not quite 5 stars but I definitely recommend it, especially if to Chabon fans.

I needed to chew on this for a night, to stare at the moon, dream, and fantasize about what I really wanted to say -- and write my panegyric in a delicate space after the book. First, I sometimes wonder if there is a genre Chabon can't master with his metaphors, his exuberance and his fantasy? At this point, he could write a book centered on zoophilic and beastial erotica and I'd gladly plunk down the full-price cost AND read it. Anyway, last night as the stars blossomed and the moon swung up over the Superstition Mountains, I felt a tug of ideas, but I needed to let them seep, to swirl, to swim and sink into the dark side of my brain. Perhaps, I'm ready. Who knows?I'm not sure if Chabon has even read Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd, but Chabon is doing something similar. He is playing with the structure of memoir, but it isn't memoir even exactly. It isn't a biography of his mother, grandmother, grandfather EXACTLY. It is family fan fiction. It is fictionalized memoir, an autobiographical novel.Chabon, gives it up in his Author's Note:\"In preparing this memoir, I have stuck to the facts except when the facts refused to conform with memory, narrative purpose, or the truth as I prefer to understand it. Whenever liberties have been taken with names, dates, places, events, and conversations, or with the identities, motivations, and interrelationships of family members and historical personages, the reader is assured that they have been taken with due abandon.\"There is a scene in the book where Chabon is describing his mother, playing with horses carved by her father. Through the act of narrowing her eyes, squinting, she was able to transform these carved toys into real horses as she played. THAT is what Chabon is doing. He is narrowing his eyes on his family's history. He is letting his imagination take the information he has and bend it, fill in the gaps, expand into an almost magical fancy. It really is a thing of wonder. The real amazing thing too about this book, is it gives the read the license and permission to do the same thing to his/her own history. We as humans are natural myth-makers. Is Chabon doing anything different than his Jewish forefathers did with the Old Testament's great myths? The telling, and retelling of these \"family\" stories start to get bent into family folklore. Pieces are added and subtracted until a new story a new myth is constructed. It might not be straight and accurate according to carbon dating, sequences, or people. The ledgers might not quite ever balance, but at its heart ... these family stories/myths contain our BIG truths. They contain us and our humanity, both our ugly, painful, and grounded past, and our lofty dreams of moons, lovers and rockets."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Memoir, fictional novel, exaggerations or just Chabon's musings, whichever way you choose to look at it, just know this book was written with a great deal of love. It shines through in the writing.As his grandfather laid dying he shared stories of his life with his grandson. Let me tell you this man lived many different lives, tried to kill his boss, blow up a bridge, spent time in prison, worked for the space program designing model rockets and loved and married a woman with mental difficulties. The novel goes back and forth, different stages of his grandfathers life, Michael discussing these thongs with his mother, his mother's recollections and his grandmother's forays into mental illness. I did think the coverage of rockets, which was his grandfather's passion always, was somewhat too lengthy, and I admit to skimming some of these sections. Yet, the other events in his life more than made up for this, it was all so interesting, almost voyeuristic, looking into someone's personal history. The funny and coincidental thing about this is that the only other book of Chabons that I read, Wonder Boys, featured a snake. A snake was also an important part of this book, occurring in his grandfather's life before he found out he was sick. Rockets and snakes? Well this is Chabon after all.ARC from publisher."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "4.5 StarsChabon\u2019s Author\u2019s Note at the beginning of Moonglow this states:In preparing this memoir, I have stuck to facts except when facts refused to conform with memory, narrative purpose, or the truth as I prefer to understand it. Wherever liberties have been taken with names, dates, places, events, and conversations, or with the identities, motivations, and interrelationships of family members and historical personages, the reader is assured that they have been taken with due abandon.Moonglow is an account, perhaps fictionalized, perhaps not, of the lives of members of the family of Chabon, with Chabon\u2019s character as narrator. His grandfather shared stories that were revealed under the influence of prescriptions for the pain he suffered from with bone cancer, and shortly before his death. A week of stories told, revelations from his grandfather\u2019s younger years. Out of these stories comes Chabon\u2019s story of his grandfather\u2019s stint in prison, his years in the horrors of WWII, the draw that space held for him, rockets, the race to the Moon. Stories about his grandmother who grew up in France during the war, his mother, his Uncle. Fortune telling. Skinless horses. \u201dNinety percent of everything he ever told me about his life, I heard during its final ten days.\u201dThere\u2019s a dreamlike quality that wanders in and out of this story, or stories, you\u2019re able to see what his grandfather saw, and feel what his grandfather felt through the haze of time, distance and pain. Even without the drug-induced fog, his grandfather was never a reliable source of information. \u201dMost of the questions people asked you, he felt, were there to fill up dead space, curtail your movements, divert your energy and attention. Anyway, my grandfather and his emotions were never really on speaking terms.\u201d This novel was a finalist for the NBCC 2016 Award for Fiction, ALA Carnegie Medal Finalist for Excellence in Fiction, Wall Street Journal\u2019s Best Novel of the Year, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, a Washington Post Best Book of the Year, an NPR Best Book of the Year, a Wall Street Journal Best Book of the Year, a Slate Best Book of the Year, a Christian Monitor Top 15 Fiction Book of the Year, a New York Magazine Best Book of the Year, a San Francisco Chronicle Book of the Year and a Buzzfeed Best Book of the Year. In other words, it has been lauded by those people that make LISTS of the best and the brightest. So, what can I say? I loved it. It might get a tiny bit bogged down once or twice, or maybe that was just me having an unusually reading-time-interrupted (and thus, frustrating) week, but there was much about this that I loved. It made me wish, yet again, that I could find some old tapes of my father, interviewing some of his old flying buddies. I loved the adventures this takes the reader on, through New Jersey, through Florida, through Germany, through different eras, places. \"Everything you've been telling me is true, though, right?\"\"Well, it's all the way I remember it happening,\" he said. \"Beyond that I make no guarantees.\"Some books are read and go straight to the heart, and stay there.

Because that stuff is purty. The hallmark of true greatness (and let\u2019s call the requirements for greatness a combination of natural talent and aptitude, sweat equity, and single-minded devotion to craft) is making something exceedingly difficult look effortless (a little bit like how I make it look so easy to poke yourself in the eye while trying to drink through a straw), and no matter how lyrical or grammatically obscure Chabon\u2019s prose, it skates easily across the surface of the page, the most well-honed pair of skates on a perfectly Zambonied ice rink.Contrast his prose with, say, Jonathan Franzen or the late and rightfully oft-lamented David Foster Wallace, both comparable titans of the modern American literary fiction scene\u2014when I read one of their most finely crafted sentences, I find myself thinking, \u201cnow THAT is a writer.\u201d Of course, if I\u2019m thinking that, then what I\u2019m NOT thinking about any longer is the story\u2014and that can be distracting, even if it\u2019s worth it to appreciate their linguistic gymnastics.Chabon at his best, on the other hand, somehow manages the neat trick of writing with a skill and elegance that is nearly peerless, but feels so natural that you are immersed in the world he creates from start to finish. That\u2019s not to say that he doesn\u2019t have his own episodic occurrences of writeritis, mind you (witness the bulk of Gentlemen of the Road, for example), but they are fewer and farther between, it seems.I should note that Chabon\u2019s plotting and storytelling are not always equal to his prose; after feeling somewhat let down by Telegraph Avenue and The Yiddish Policemen's Union, I went into Moonglow with some trepidation, a feeling that persisted through the first quarter of the book as I struggled to get into the flow. Once I did, however, and I found it happened right around the time Chabon begins describing his grandfather\u2019s experiences in World War II, I got sucked back into that familiar and blissful state of simultaneously admiring Chabon\u2019s dazzling skill while not really noticing it. Moonglow purports to be a somewhat ficitionalized biography of Chabon\u2019s maternal (but not genetic) grandfather, but as one might expect, the veracity of the tale is questionable at best (and revealed to be even more tenuous in the book\u2019s Acknowledgments). If it doesn\u2019t throb with the restless, youthful energy and heartache of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh or match the epic grandeur and scope of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, it still manages to carve out a rightful place alongside some of Chabon\u2019s better work, a quieter but still imaginative meditation on truth, story, perception, grief, anger, dreams, and, above all, the messy byproduct of the union of those things we call life."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Moonglow by Michael Chabon is a 2016 Harper publication. I must admit, up front, that I\u2019ve never a book by this author. That is not to say I don\u2019t have his books sitting on my shelves or loaded onto my Kindle, because I do. However, I\u2019ve never managed to get around to reading them. My library was really pushing this book recently, so I placed a hold on it. Shockingly, few people were ahead of me, so I nabbed a copy almost immediately. Having no idea what to expect, but hoping for something different and maybe a little challenging, I dived into what some have referred to as a \u2018novel memoir\u2019 or memoir/novel. Michael Chabon, in 1989, travels to Oakland, California to visit his dying grandfather. Never having revealed a great deal to his grandson during his life, his grandfather decides to remedy that, by regaling Michael with stories from his colorful and adventurous life, while on his deathbed.\u2018Ninety percent of everything he ever told me about his life, I heard in its final ten days.\u2019The author never refers to his grandfather by name, and I have not idea why, but the gentleman lived through many significant phases in history. His tale is not told chronologically, but skips through time in no particular order. While I\u2019m usually pretty good at dealing with flashbacks in novels, this nilly willy time trip, did create some problems for me at times. I also lost interest a time or two, as the topics just didn\u2019t appeal to me, in any way. But, there were poignant moments that made up for those dry spells. I may have this all wrong, but I gathered the grandfather was the main focus of the book, and the other characters were meant to be secondary. I didn\u2019t know what to make of his grandfather for a while, but by the end of the book, I realized I had enjoyed getting to know the man and appreciated his humor.  Now, why is the book labeled as a novel memoir?\u201cIn preparing for this memoir, I have stuck to the facts except when the facts refused to conform with memory, narrative purpose, or the truth as I prefer to understand it.\u201d How much is absolute truth, how much is embellishment? Is it a real memoir, or a novel disguised as a memoir?Either way, the book is unique, with realistic and compelling characterizations, and a sophisticated prose, which is what I liked best about it. Overall, this one is a little off the beaten path for me. It\u2019s not the type of book I would want to read often, but I am glad I gave it a try, and it has inspired me to move the books I already own by this author closer to the top of my TBR pile. 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "Just as you sense some authors haven\u2019t yet written their best book \u2013 Zadie Smith? - you feel others have already written their masterpiece and no matter how many more they write they will never quite top it. Nicole Krauss with The History of Love springs to mind. As does Chabon with The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. I\u2019d be amazed if he ever tops that. Moonglow doesn\u2019t but nevertheless it is a thrilling and highly distinguished achievement. First of all, think of your own favourite grandfather and try to put together a narrative of his life. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll soon realise some defining \u201cfacts\u201d have never quite been verified, that there are conflicting reports of certain events, one or other of which you choose to believe to suit your own narrative, that there\u2019s a fair bit of hearsay colouring his story and there are blanks you yourself have endeavoured to fill in. It was fitting I read this together with Orlando, a high spirited pastiche of the pretensions of all biography. Moonglow is purportedly a memoir of Chabon\u2019s grandfather but it reads like a highly sophisticated novel. Often while reading I found myself thinking, no one surely could have a grandfather this interesting, so tailor made to be the hero of a novel. The same was true of his grandmother who, it will turn out, has created a fictitious self to survive the fallout of her wartime experiences. That misted twilight realm between fact and fiction is where this book mostly operates. It makes you think a lot about memory, its expedient ordering principles, its white lies and its hindsight stocktaking and balancing of the books. The other hugely impressive facet of this book is its structure. Chabon\u2019s grandfather is dying of cancer when he narrates haphazardly to his grandson his memories. Chabon resists any temptation to write a chronological account of his grandfather\u2019s life. Instead it\u2019s as if he mirrors the non-linear laws of memory\u2019s treasure hunting determination to find meaning and order. Like I said the material he has to work with is the stuff of any novelist\u2019s dreams. His grandfather\u2019s role in the Second World War is to find the Nazi rocket scientist, Wernher von Braun, before the Russians do. When he learns of the thousands of slave workers deployed to build the rockets his intention is to kill Braun. He marries an Auschwitz survivor. She is as compelling a character as the grandfather and their marriage is depicted with moving though unsentimental tenderness. When she has a breakdown his anger is such that he tries to kill his boss, for no reason except to vent his rage, and is sent to prison. He has a lifelong obsession with rockets and space travel, a talent in this field too. \u201cThe rocket was beautiful. In conception it had been shaped by an artist to break a chain that had bound the human race ever since we first gained consciousness of earth's gravity and all its analogs in suffering, failure and pain. It was at once a prayer sent heavenward and the answer to that prayer: Bear me away from this awful place.\u201d Annoyingly I watched a documentary about the hunt for the Nazi rocket scientists a month before starting this. I can\u2019t now remember if Michael Chabon\u2019s grandfather was mentioned. No doubt in my memory of the programme he will eventually play a starring role.

I lost all sense of time and place and briefly thought I was a child again, and I had to force myself to look up from the book and shake my head. I was entranced. I was transfixed.But, it's fitting. This is, after all, a book about the continuum, the interweaving of all generations, of all of our stories. And it's about trauma, and suffering. And sex and joy.Oh, and it's about gravity. And rockets.You see, it turns out. . . we are not always the hero in the story. And that sucks, because we thought we were. We imagined that we were always the good guy or the bad guy, not both, at different times. It's painful to discover that your grandfather was once the hero who risked life and limb to save a cat from an alligator, but was also the same boy who once callously tossed a kitten from a third story window. And so it goes.We are the \u201clonely slaves of gravity,\u201d the ones who make good choices, the same ones who make bad choices, the ones who have convinced ourselves that we are so very different from our great-grandfather or our aunt or our father. And gravity pushes down on us, crushes our faces against the earth, makes us feel puny and small, so some of us dream of flying to the moon, blasting off to be free.We put our hopes and dreams into a shiny, metal phallus, the rocket, the ultimate metaphor for escapism, only to learn (in several really long chapters) that the rocket's origins are steeped in Holocaust madness. We thought the rocket was everything good and everything right (just like people), but the rocket \u201cwas not a means to liberate the human spirit from the chains of gravity; it was only a pretext for further enchainment.\u201dSh*t!So, you can't blast off, and you can't keep from being yanked down, chained by your own gravity, and it's not a good idea to be \u201cweightless and drifting,\u201d either.You're orbiting. . . and you need to find a way to make that work.And Chabon, like all gifted writers, can't solve your problems. He can only shed some moonlight on your situation.And may I end with. . . Hot damn, Mr. Chabon.

With a seam of dark humor that brings to mind Jonas Jonasson\u2019s The Hundred-Year-Old Man..., Moonglow inventively fuses family history and fiction but leaves cracks for happiness and meaning to shine through.See my full review on the \nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\n website."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357213-sam", "userReview": "\"I'm disappointed in myself. In my life. All my life, everything I tried, I only got halfway there. You try to take advantage of the time you have. That's what they tell you to do. But when you're old, you look back and you see all you did with all that time is waste it. All you have is a story of things you never started or couldn't finish. Things you fought with all your heart to build that didn't last or fought with all your heart to get rid of and they're all still around. I'm ashamed of myself.\"\"I'm not ashamed of you,\" I said. \"I'm proud of you.\"...\"Anyway, it's a pretty good story,\" I said. \"You have to admit.\" \nMoonglow is a pretty good story by Michael Chabon, a novel cum fictionalized memoir centered on Chabon's maternal grandfather but in many ways a multigenerational family portrait. I've read two of Chabon's books prior to Moonglow: his children's baseball fantasy book Summerland that I found endearing and with great storytelling and imagination (but lost me on some of the baseball bits) and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, one of my all time favorite books that I try to re-read every year or so. So I was expecting to enjoy Moonglow, but I was not expecting to be as enchanted as I was with this read, and formally usher Chabon into my list of favorite writers.There are so many things I loved about Moonglow. One is how tightly wound and cohesive Chabon's narrative ultimately proves to be, when from the outset it looks like a series of anecdotes and episodes in the life of his grandfather, grandmother, mother, or other family member. But Chabon's masterful storytelling means that all of the stories have a purpose in the larger whole, and something once introduced usually reappears in a new or interesting way, and whether or not it's impactful on the whole, there are no hanging details left unresolved. Early in the narrative, in the final years of Chabon's grandfather's life, we're introduced to his quest to kill the alligator or snake that ate Ramon, a cat belonging to the deceased husband of Sally. It's a perfect meet-cute and meet-quirk of a scene, in which Sally and the grandfather interact, form opinions and revise them and revise again, and eventually leads to the grandfather beginning a relationship with Sally and embarking on the mission to find and kill the alligator/snake. Nearing the end of the book, that dangling detail comes back full circle: when Sally and the grandfather are out looking for the dastardly reptile, in the midst of a declaration of love, Ramon himself appears, bloody and blackened and fat from eating what was imagined to be his killer. If a small moment like this is properly and charmingly revisited and concluded, if differently from how the reader may have thought things would turn out, Chabon has it mastered with the larger set pieces and major themes: his grandmother's mysterious past and demons that torment her; his grandfather's love of rockets through the years; his grandfather's strong but occasionally tenyous relationship with Chabon's mother who is not his biological child.Chabon's grandfather gets the lion's share of the attention, and he is a marvelous character and sounds as though he was also a pretty amazing man. It opens with a fantastic little moment of Chabon's grandfather basically going postal on the president of a company that just fired him: he was chosen since they felt he'd be unlikely to make any trouble, and Chabon uses this to show the reader just how wrong that idea is, and just how many levels, how many lives his grandfather has. From the streets of Philadelphia to WWII secret missions, to prison radios and rocket building to NASA model making, Chabon's grandfather wears many hats but is always devoted to his wife, increasingly troubled and unstable, and his daughter, Chabon's mother. The relationship between Chabon and his grandfather is also so well drawn, as they interrupt the storytelling to bring nonsequitors and related questions up, and we see the love between them and the family similarities, but also evidence of the generational gap and distance too of growing up in very different eras and with different guiding sensibilities. There's something somewhat Princess Bride-y in it, which adds to its charm: Chabon and his grandfather switch off narrating events (and his grandmother and mother do as well, as does Sally later on), and then there's the commentary within the story on the events or the telling of those events. Chabon's writing is, to my taste, great: revealing, smart, light. He wields metaphor and culture and history deftly, and though he can write overlong in some passages that can slow down one's interest (sometimes on the details of the rockets I found myself wanting to hurry through), most of the time you're effortlessly carried through on the strength of the narrative, the characters, and the humor. Oh the humor in Moonglow! God I found this funny, laughing out loud in parts, appreciate chuckles in others, devouring scenes with big wide smiles. Taste is subjective of course, and not everyone has the same sense or appreciation for humor, but I loved reading Moonglow and a lot had to do with just how much fun it was to read. There's a part in which the grandfather and Chabon's mother go to visit the grandmother in the hospital, where a play is about to be performed, and a female caretaker introduces them to the author of the play: \"How are you?\" Mrs Outcault said very loudly.Mr. Casamonaca nodded genially and made a looping benedictory gesture in the air, just in front of his face, more ornate than a cross, as if he were a priest in a sect whose symbol was the holy coat hanger of God.\"Sign language,\" Mrs. Outcault explained. \"Poor thing's deaf as a boot. I heard he was struck by lightning, though I can't say for sure.\"With his long pallid fingers and his nails manicured to a moonlike luster, Mr. Casamonaca continued to draw things across the space between him and my mother. The regular rippling of a corrugated roof. The outline of a jellyfish. The downward spiral of water in a toilet bowl.Mrs. Outcault nodded emphatically. \"Oh yes,\" she said. \"I know. You're so right.\"\"What's he saying?\"\"I have no idea,\" Mrs. Outcault said through a tight smile. She kept on nodding. \"It isn't real sign language at all. Just something he made up. He never learned to speak English very well, and in the past few years he's lost the ability to read and write in Italian.\"\"He - Then how did he write a play?\"\"He dictated it to your mother, which is why she has been so involved in all this. Using those crazy signs of his.\"\"My mom doesn't know sign language.\"\"Apparently, she is fluent in Mr. Casamonaca's.\"My mother watched Mr. Casamonaca's hands and fingers explain the behavior of skyrockets, the opening of a beer can, and the proper means for setting a golf ball on a tee.\"It looks like he's just making it up as he goes along,\" she said.\"That is a popular theory,\" said Mrs. Outcault. There is so much life in Moonglow: a novel with the trappings of memoir that wraps in the lives of Chabon's grandfather, grandmother, mother, and even himself in parts. The humor, the struggles, the desperation, the guilt, the Jewish culture, the bonds of blood... all here and all executed brilliantly and woven into the fabric of the larger whole. The family is so well drawn (coming from real people, I suppose it was both easier and harder to do) and the narrative strong, the moments from life well chosen to entertain and to better flesh out into a story of a family. I really liked this book, and while parts did feel like they could have been edited a bit tighter to not slow the reader's pace/enjoyment, this family saga gets 4.5 enthusiastic stars from me, rounded up for the fantastic writing and sheer fun.\n\"Everything you've been telling me is true, though, right?\"\"Well, it's all the way I remember it happening,\" he said. \"Beyond that I make no guarantees.\""}, {"userName": "Matthew Quann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann", "userReview": "This is my third book from Michael Chabon. Chabon never writes the same book twice, and each book has been terrific in its own way. His endlessly celebrated\u2014and one of my all-time favourite novels\u2014 The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay trades comic book shtick with political and societal upheaval while building some of the most memorable character moments I\u2019ve ever read. \nThe Yiddish Policeman\u2019s Union\n, by contrast, is a gumshoe noir set in a fictional Jewish settlement in Alaska that could sit comfortably beside Pynchon\u2019s Inherent Vice. What the two books share, aside from an author, are a dedication to character, stellar writing, a fascination with the ephemera of times past, and deeply humanistic narratives that stuck with me long after the final pages were turned. Other than that, the books are wildly different. Moonglow, again, twisted my expectations of a Chabon novel. First thing: it isn\u2019t really a novel, but not quite a memoir. Chabon has pasted together conversations with his palliative grandfather in his final days, oodles of research, historical fact, memory (that tricky, unreliable, ephemeral creature), and liberties taken to \u201cconform with memory, narrative purpose, or the truth as I prefer to understand it (Author\u2019s Note, Moonglow.\u201d It makes for a tale that seems at times to be too strange to be non-fiction, to personal to be anything but real, and had me questioning throughout what was true. In a stroke of brilliance, the questions I was asking about the narrative are the same that Chabon\u2019s family ends up asking through his research. This time-hopping, perspective shifting narrative both serves to keep the story moving at a lively pace while inviting the reader into the thicket of the diverging accounts with which Chabon has been wrestling. It\u2019s a clever way of putting the reader in the headspace of the writer, but the book never seems like an experiment in structure alone. The book is filled with stories and recollections that run the full gamut of human feeling. There\u2019s the account of Chabon\u2019s grandfather in his golden years sojourning into the woods in pursuit of a household pet-eating snake that is equal parts comedic and poignant display of grief. This is then juxtaposed with a WWII mission where his grandfather plays an interesting part in the American pursuit of V-2 rocket technology. The story jumps from adventure, to reminiscence, to regret, the joy of discovery, the pursuit of a worthy task, and familial love.What most surprised me with the novel/memoir was how large a part Chabon\u2019s grandmother plays in the proceedings. The synopsis on the dust jacket downplays her involvement, though her story is central to the telling made by Chabon\u2019s grandfather on his deathbed. The revelations made by the stories told by his grandfather contrast with historical fact and, later, medical documentation. There are truths and lies woven together in the same spirit of love that they become almost impossible to separate without destroying the entire tapestry. What I\u2019ve written so far downplays the humanistic narrative of the story. Chabon\u2019s grandfather\u2019s struggle to bring comfort to his mentally ill wife is heart wrenching in its stoic portrayal of love. Chabon\u2019s grandmother serves initially as a mystery, then a tragic character, but resolves into person that seems real because of her conflicted nature. Just a little over the mid-way point of the novel, this exchange between Chabon and his grandfather about the nature of their conversations seem to drive home the purpose of the novel.\u201dYou think this explains everything,\u201d my grandfather said. He freighted the word explains with as much contempt as it would bear before exiling it from his mouth. \u201cMe and your grandmother. Your mother. My time in prison. The war.\u201d He turned from the window.In his eyes, through the haze of hydromorophone, I saw a flash of something I took, based on the historical record, for anger. \u201cYou think it explains you.\u201d\u201cIt explains a lot,\u201d I said.\u201cIt explains nothing.\u201d\u201cIt explains a little.\u201d (Moonglow page 239-240) It\u2019s true: the novel does not explain everything. It does not tie up the narrative in a neat little bow and send it on its way towards the reader. It struggles against its packaging and it refuses to conform to any box that might hold it. Chabon's books are each different, I think, because he's trying to answer a different question with each project. In his writing of Moonglow, Chabon explains a little in an effort to explain himself. Though it might not all fit together and conform to a single vision of the truth, it makes a strong approximation of truth. It is that pursuit of truth to which many of us aspire, and Moonglow is the beautiful struggle of one man to uncover that truth."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "A Magnificent Chiaroscuro\nWe are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; How restlessly they speed and gleam and quiver,Streaking the darkness radiantly! yet soonNight closes round, and they are lost for ever:-- \"Mutability,\" Percy Bysshe ShelleyMoonglow, Michael Chabon's brilliantly constructed narrative, documents the narrator's conversations with his dying grandfather that travel back and forth between the grandfather on his deathbed and the story he's giving of his past. This construct accomplished two wonderful things for Chabon's storytelling. One, it forced him to put the brakes on all the baroque prose and schmaltzy dialogue that so vexed both Telegraph Avenue (I gave it up 3/4 of the way through) and Kavalier and Clay (I know I'm an outlier on this one). Initially I was skeptical of this novel because the previous two put ants on me.In addition, Chabon gets to show his finely honed storytelling skills--instead of trying to impress with his lexicon--by weaving together frayed story lines to compose what stroke-and-layer by stroke-and-layer becomes a magnificent chiaroscuro lingered in moonlight, of his grandfather (an admirable, ingenious, gruffly romantic man's man from the Greatest Generation), his grandmother (a fascinating and troubled soul who came to the U.S. after WWII with a young daughter on her hip and a numbered tattoo on her arm), and their unique marriage, while family secrets obscure the background.Chabon vividly captures the mixture of pleasure and plaintive of grandpa's past, infused with charm and wit.

The opening promise that the author had 'stuck to facts except when facts refused to conform to memory, narrative purpose or the truth as I prefer to understand it' speaks so much to how we all construct our memories and especially the ways in which we relate them to others. Bearing this in mind, the story about his grandfather throwing a cat out of a third story window for the sake of curiosity did not endear me to him as a character. I genuinely struggled to reignite my interest in the man afterwards, which only goes to show that I was completely lost within the narrative/memoir maze of the book. When reading other novels, I don't worry whether each little vignette is real and how it reflects on the 'real man'. Chabon's gambit worked. I know not what was real or what wasn't.

The whole notion of a fictionalized autobiography left me rather cold before reading Moonglow. Now I'm a convert...I believe that a truly skilled writer can inspire me, thrill me, using unexpected literary combinations....especially when they are filled with the obvious love that Chabon brings to this work.What is \"real\" and what is not is probably beside the point here. One point is the importance of the stories we tell in our families, how we create our lore and sense of who we are. This can rise or fall on problems of trust but can be saved by love. You may detect my avoiding certain specifics about the book, such as who is at the center, etc., well I guess I am. A young man named Mike is narrating this book based on the conversations he had with his maternal grandfather shortly before his grandfather died. Or did he. What stories have come from within the author's mind vs from within his family.There was an afterword in my edition (and hopefully in all) wherein Chabon talks more about what is at play in this book, the family stories, his grandfather, grandmother, his mother, \"real\" memories vs family lore vs the type of memories that children retain based partly on reality and partly on confused recollection. Then there is the mind of the author who uses his creativity to bring his family together in a story which combines everything. Understand, this is me the reader speaking here.

I have The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay and Telegraph Avenue on my TBR shelf. (The real books bookshelf, not ebooks!)

Especially in a novel about the effect of war on the lives of the narrator's grandparents, where happiness is found 'in the cracks' between failure and mental health breakdowns, and heroes are found to be villians, and fiction is better than knowing the truth.Stories told to Chabon by his terminally ill grandfather inspired Moonglow. In the novel, a grandfather reveals what had remained unspoken, a gift for his grandson (Chabon) to turn into an orderly account, with the admonition to 'make it mean something.'His fictionalized grandfather, a Drexel Tech graduate, joined the Army Corps of Engineers before WWII; his wartime experiences leaves him with a 'form of spiritual aphasia' and searching for purpose. He meets a beautiful girl, another victim of the war, who has a daughter, and struggles for mental stability. Together they hope to 'fly to the moon', but the journey is fraught with crash landings and heartbreak.The backstory is told in bits and pieces, interwoven with stories from other time frames, slowly revealing the grandfather's history.\"You think this explains everything?\" the grandfather queries, \"Me and your grandmother.

Like him, I'm an intellectual Jew, born within a year of him, and with many of the same cultural references. For years, he was to me what Phillip Roth was for my father: a funhouse mirror of my times and fascinations, as well as a lens through which to freshly grasp history and world events. Most of all, he was just plain fun to read. Like, teary-eyed, breathlessly fun.That peaked with The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay. To be fair, a work of that level is both a life-defining achievement and an anchor around an artist's neck. The Pulitzer followed, which is like the Mafioso kiss of death. \"You're the genius of our times! You can do no wrong!\"\u2014a poisonous enough blow to creativity\u2014is implicitly followed by, \"You've peaked! All else will be compared to what you've done!\"If Chabon did feel a load on his shoulders, he bore it with aplomb. Yiddish Policemen's Union was a truly great read. If I wasn't as thrilled as with Kavalier, that was understandable. Beethoven may never have written another 5th, but it's safe to say his later output was pretty worthy.With Telegraph Avenue, a sinking feeling started to take root. There were moments of joy, but I found myself lacking motivation. And now, Moonglow. I'm a little sick at heart to say that, if it hadn't been a Chabon book, I would have abandoned it half-way through. As it is, I put it aside more than once, and had to push myself to return. Overall, the book felt to me like 47 ripping yarns about one life, all sewn together only by the loose concept of memoir. Chabon's penchant for endearing, vividly drawn characters persists, and his grasp of history and period, ditto. He renders such pleasing prose that you feel sad when a story is over. The problem is... 47 times? Playing cat-and-mouse with the fact-versus-fiction line is clever, but doesn't make up for the lack of vision.My most frequent problem, though, was feeling buried under a mountain of detail. Chabon is famous for his monumental vocabulary and encyclopedic knowledge bank. I've never felt so much like that trait was a drawback. I more than once groaned, \"What happened to the story?\" I'm almost constitutionally incapable of skipping segments of a book, but I did here. There are Big Themes aplenty here\u2014one of Chabon's strengths\u2014and each of them could merit a separate book. (I think maybe those books are all shoehorned into this one.) Long segues on New York State prison history, cascades of technical information about rocketry, and\u2014perhaps strangest of all\u2014rambling background on secondary characters. And a whole lot more extraneous stuff. It got directly in the way of my emotional involvement.Chabon also seems to have fallen into a comfortable character type for his heroes: Lovably bumbling and ineffectual in some realms (usually women and romance), redemptively brave and sharp in others (important work, or a tendency toward good deeds).I never thought the day would come when I would give a Chabon novel a three-star review. In all honesty, if I'd been allowed, I'd have given two-and-a-half. * * *The author doesn't have much room left to rise in the opinion of the reading elite, but if he does, I hope it comes by virtue of a truly fresh take on a new type of person and problem, in which the tsunami of detail and virtuosic world-building are rendered unnecessary by the novel approach (pun clearly intended). Roth, in his long journey from Portnoy's Complaint to The Human Stain and beyond, managed to stay with familiar themes, and yet savored the challenge of reinventing himself each time.I dearly hope Chabon will make that his New Year's Resolution. He's more than capable of it."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david", "userReview": "In this book, Michael Chabon relates the deathbed memoirs of his grandfather. But the book reads like a novel, with only occasional interjections from the author, as well as tangents related to the author's mother. How much of the story is true? Maybe all of it. Maybe none of it. It really doesn't matter. It is fiction, after all. But, this novel is told in a structure that is unlike anything I've ever read. I listened to this book as an audiobook, narrated by George Newbern--he does an excellent job bringing the characters to life, in an unaffected manner--and it was not at all difficult to follow the storyline, even though it does not flow chronologically.The grandfather, who is never named, is an exceptional character. Toward the end of World War II, he is charged with the job of leading a team of soldiers to search out German rocketry--the actual rockets as well as the scientists and engineers who built them, especially Wernher von Braun. The grandfather builds up a love/hate relationship with the German rockets and their builders. Nothing is black and white. We also see what happens during \"liberation\" of towns; sometimes the townspeople do not want to be liberated, and we see what happens during the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.The most charming part of the novel is the love story between the grandfather and his French-born grandmother, the terrible things she endured during the war, and her eventual mental illness. The most endearing part of the novel, is his description of his mother when she was a young child. When Chabon continually calls the little girl \"my mother\", it just brings out a humorous twist that makes me think--even our parents were once children.I certainly recommend this book to all fans of Michael Chabon. The structure of this novel is so different, and the charm of the numerous stories is sure to captivate any lover of good fiction."}, {"userName": "Mike W", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26371056-mike-w", "userReview": "Said to be inspired by a stoic grandfather's sudden verbosity on his deathbed, Moonglow is fictionalized account of Chabon's family that focuses mainly on his maternal grandparents.Like Knausgaard's fictional memoirs, one is never sure where the truth starts or stops, and with that fiction label it really doesn't matter. The story feels true however, and I found myself forgetting at times that at the very least it is truth exaggerated or significantly added upon.While there is a serious risk of navel gazing with an attempt such as this, I never got the sense that this was so with Moonglow. None of Chabon's contemplations feel useless and his tie-ins from his grandfathers military service to his work with and interest in NASA and Wernher Von Braun were beautifully expressed. What most affected me however was the painful and sincere feeling portrayal of his grandmother's mental illness. Especially since her struggles occurred in a time when such illness wasn't so easy to talk about. Her brilliance and her pain were on full display and I sensed devotion and respect from the author both for his grandmother and her eccentricities and his grandfather and his noble handling of their private pains.This is a beautifully constructed novel with the kind of readable and brilliant prose that will remind readers of The Adventures of Kavalier and Klay and is likely to be in the discussion for 2017's major awards.Note: Free ARC received from publisher via Edelweiss"}, {"userName": "aPriL does feral sometimes ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes", "userReview": "This is a heartwarming fictional biography, maybe, of Michael Chabon's grandfather, possibly.The title 'reflects' it all - moonglow is mirrored light, not an actual glowing of original inner light, gentle reader...I can't decide if this book is a biographical fiction or a fictionalized biography. Whatever. It is a touching panagyric for a man who had a, to me, romantic life, despite that he obviously hated sentimentality and any florid display of false morality. A World War II veteran, the main character, called 'grandfather', faces the dramas of his life with courage, accepting his responsibilities to help others and his culpability when he was at fault or in error of judgment.'Mike' is narrating the story of his grandfather's life. Grandfather was a terrific, if flawed, parent, friend, and husband, and perhaps a bit of a martyr. Obsessed with rockets and traveling to the moon, 'grandfather' learned everything he could first about German, and later American, rocketry, while at the same time, trying to support his French mentally-ill wife. She is haunted by an early life living among Nazis.Grandfather inspires Michael by the example of his known life, his dark wit, and his intelligence. He often supported three generations of his family with his resilience, perseverance and sometimes strained loyalty to family members who were more flawed than himself.Mike clearly loved his grandfather, but even more, admired and cherished him. Michael decided to research his grandparents' life after his grandfather's death, following leads given in a period of time when the dying bedridden man finally spoke of his past while under the influence of painkillers. I think Michael also wanted to know why and how his grandfather became the man Michael loved, and solve some family mysteries at the same time, especially about his grandmother. It takes Michael fourteen years to put together enough factual discoveries and to gather more in-depth interviews which backed up the previous, more casually told, family stories to complete this - biography? novel? - which includes the uncovering of an entirely unsuspected history of an important family member. This book is wonderful, gentle reader. Michael Chabon is a great writer. He has successfully re-created a fully realized 3D image of the extraordinary ordinary man 'grandfather' was in this book, even if the narrator Mike had his vision a little blurred by tears of grief and loss."}, {"userName": "Mattia Ravasi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14579657-mattia-ravasi", "userReview": "Video-review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ2VV...Featured in my Top 20 Books I Read in 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X6OQ...The most Pynchonian of all Chabon's novels, but not in the overt, copycat manner you might imagine.

E l\u2019autore ci prende pure un po\u2019 in giro, in questo dialogo fra lui stesso e il nonno narratore: -\t\u2026E comunque \u00e8 una gran bella storia, devi ammetterlo.-\tSi?

Ma tant\u2019\u00e8: il romanzo, cos\u00ec come le altre opere di Chabon (che pure utilizza con molta parsimonia il tasto dell\u2019ebraismo), costituisce un altro tassello di quell\u2019inesauribile narrativa giudaica americana che da Bellow a Roth (Philip ed Henry), da Salinger a Potok, Charyn e via via fino agli epigoni come Auster o Lethem, narra con grande intensit\u00e0 vite che si intrecciano di qua e di l\u00e0 dall\u2019Atlantico.

Tongue loosened by powerful painkillers, memory stirred by the imminence of death, Chabon\u2019s grandfather shared recollections and told stories the younger man had never heard before, uncovering bits and pieces of a history long buried and forgotten. That dreamlike week of revelations forms the basis for the novel Moonglow, the latest feat of legerdemain in the ongoing magic act that is the art of Michael Chabon. Moonglow unfolds as the deathbed confession, made to his grandson, of a man the narrator refers to only as \u201cmy grandfather.\u201d It is a tale of madness, of war and adventure, of sex and desire and ordinary love, of existential doubt and model rocketry, of the shining aspirations and demonic underpinnings of American technological accomplishment at mid-century and, above all, of the destructive impact\u2014and the creative power\u2014of the keeping of secrets and the telling of lies. A gripping, poignant, tragicomic, scrupulously researched and wholly imaginary transcript of a life that spanned the dark heart of the twentieth century, Moonglow is also a tour de force of speculative history in which Chabon attempts to reconstruct the mysterious origins and fate of Chabon Scientific, Co., an authentic mail-order novelty company whose ads for scale models of human skeletons, combustion engines and space rockets were once a fixture in the back pages of Esquire, Popular Mechanics, and Boy\u2019s Life. Along the way Chabon devises and reveals, in bits and pieces whose hallucinatory intensity is matched only by their comic vigor and the radiant moonglow of his prose, a secret history of his own imagination.From the Jewish slums of prewar South Philadelphia to the invasion of Germany, from a Florida retirement village to the penal utopia of New York\u2019s Wallkill Prison, from the heyday of the space program to the twilight of \u201cthe American Century,\u201d Moonglow collapses an era into a single life and a lifetime into a single week. A lie that tells the truth, a work of fictional non-fiction, an autobiography wrapped in a novel disguised as a memoir, Moonglow is Chabon at his most daring, his most moving, his most Chabonesque.", "title": "Moonglow", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29100278-moonglow", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1477659994l/29100278.jpg", "reviews": 2720, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2715.Michael_Chabon", "name": "Michael Chabon"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Abandoned", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29100278-moonglow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26795307-moonglow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30046315-moonglow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33385371-moonglow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36315348-sognando-la-luna", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3985.The_Amazing_Adventures_of_Kavalier_Clay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16703.The_Yiddish_Policemen_s_Union", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16707.Wonder_Boys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16697.The_Mysteries_of_Pittsburgh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10756240-telegraph-avenue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
