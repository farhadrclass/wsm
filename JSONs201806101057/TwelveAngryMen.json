After reading the play and watching the movie a few weeks ago, I feel like every American should have to read Twelve Angry Men. The play centers on a jury deliberation. During several heated hours (literally and figuratively), twelve men discuss whether the verdict they come to will exonerate a young man for the murder of his father, or condemn him to a death sentence that the judge explained he had no qualms about ordering, should the verdict be guilty. Each man plays his part, from strong prejudice to neutral to easily swayed to chaotic to apathetic. I found this play to be riveting and extremely frightening. (specifically because I cannot stop thinking about the fact that most juries probably do not have that voice of reason or pay such close attention to detail. There are so many scary aspects to both human nature and the jury process, not least of which is that juries often have the life and/or liberty of another human being in their hands) The jurors are given no names, so it can be a feat to try to follow along with an understanding of which character is which, however the overall discussions are the most important aspect of the play, and a reader can easily follow the feel of the room and see whose arguments are most persuasive. This play can be read in a mere hour or so and I recommend it to everyone, especially people who want to read more classics."}, {"userName": "George K.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL":

Or maybe not. Maybe I'll simply stick to reviewing. Recently I've been reading several plays and short stories. In part because I'm required to (like this one) and in part because I enjoy the difference in media. So I shall promptly go over what makes Twelve Angry Men different.The play itself covers the case of an apparently guilty boy claimed to have stabbed his father. The prosecution appears to have condemned the boy effectively and the witness evidence appears sound to all jury members. That is all except for one juror alone who stands questioning whether the boy should be condemned so rashly. And gradually the true details of the case emerge under cross examination. Rose uses his play to analyse human prejudices effectively and in a highly intriguing manner. Like a surgeon he opens up the minds and hearts of his characters to reveal how their backgrounds and personal opinions influence their decisions. Its a brilliant exploration and analysis of prejudice really and makes you think. Are all the decisions we firmly make based on evidence or are they more emotional?The one reason I feel I cannot give this brilliant piece of work five stars is that a reader can easily be lost with who is who. Rose never names his characters instead referring to them as Juror 2, Juror 3 and so on. Which sounds alight until you find yourself trying to work out which Juror is on which side and what Juror is arguing what. However the manner in which Rose attempts to tackle an intriguing and difficult subject matter makes this text worth both a read and a viewing as a film (I recommend the Henry Fonda version rather than any other).So now comes to the all important question: why should you read this play? Well for starters it is short. You can easily read it in one sitting if you're a voracious reader. Secondly it contains brilliantly scripted dialogue and implied questions. Thirdly its an engaging text which is well written if not the most poetic play ever. Its simply well structured and to the point, the hallmarks of powerful writing. So I suggest that you read it and enjoy it. And if you don't well I have the last life since you read this review and wasted seconds off your life. Oh wait I wasted time writing this then..."}, {"userName": "Greta", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta", "userReview": "\"Oh. Well...I just think he's guilty. I thought it was obvious.\"\nThis is a passionate play about twelve jurors who must decide whether a boy who's charged with premeditated homicide of his father, is guilty or not. Only one member of the jury believes there's a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, and forces the other jurors to examine the evidence more thoroughly. The fierce argument that follows is a powerful warning against rash judgment and condemnation based on ignorance, prejudice or casualness and a reminder of how one courageous person can make a difference by confronting other people's opinions."}, {"userName": "\u0646\u0642\u062f \u0631\u0648\u0632", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72225278",

go and watch the film version of this with Henry Fonda, as it is one of the greatest films of all time. I have yet to meet one person that did not like nor appreciate the importance of that film.\u201cThere were eleven votes for \u201cguilty.\u201d It\u2019s not easy for me to raise my hand and send a boy off to die without talking about it first.\u201d  This short play follows a jury, as they try to pass a verdict on a homicide case. Juror 8 believes there is reasonable doubt while all the other men have ridiculous reasons to simply pass the guilty verdict, from needing to get to a baseball game, to racism, to the relationship between a juror and his own son. Juror 8 is in an struggle, trying to convince all other eleven to leave their prejudices and biases separate from the case, as the life of a sixteen-year old is at stake.In the end we are left to wonder if the decision made was the correct one, but at least all points of the case were looked at rather than simply glossed over. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And no matter where you run into it, prejudice obscures the truth.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "I love this. It's so brilliant in so many ways. I remember reading this in school and thinking how unfair it was of the main \"antagonist\" juror, #3, to disregard all points regarding anything that might lead to a not-guilty verdict simply because of his own personal prejudices and opinions. It's interesting to me now how that tells me as much about myself as it does about the characters. Back then, I thought that Juror 3 was a mean man, almost evil, and that he just wanted the defendant to die to make himself feel powerful. Now, I don't necessarily disagree with my younger self... but I do think that there's more nuance there than just being mean and wanting control. I love how, in himself, he displays all of the negativity that he is condemning the defendant for. But he's so blinded by his anger that he can't see it. I love Juror 8 for being able, and more importantly, WILLING to really take the responsibility of someone's life and death seriously and think about it with an open mind. There's a little dialogue which, in the audio, was probably about 30 seconds long and which really summed up this book for me. One of the jurors accuses another of not understanding the phrase \"reasonable doubt\". He gets pissed, or MORE pissed, and the scene devolves into another shouting match, and the moment passes... but for me, that's the book right there. The guilty voters were bullheadedly refusing to sway because they couldn't stop seeing the case in reverse: Guilty until PROVEN innocent. I think it's that way in all things, though. We see what we want to see, and some of us never move past that. The thing I love about this book is that the jurors do grow and get past it... at least in this instance.

Females are involved in none of the overt process of decision making in either work. Nonetheless, there is a striking difference between them. Twelve Angry Men is just that. But The Affair has a strong female presence. The men who have wives are highly influenced by them. It is the women who impel the men to action and it is the women who want justice at any cost. Behind the throne, yes, but more or less in control of it. It would be nice to think that this reflected well upon male academics, but I somehow doubt it's the case. I guess Twelve Angry Men had to be called that. Twelve Angry People or An Angry Gender-balanced Jury or An Angry Jury of people representing the entire spectrum of sexuality doesn't really work - I hope I'm not just being old-fashioned in saying that. Please don't ban me from your university.Still, I don't think I really noticed the maleness of Twelve Angry Men despite the way it was blatantly put forward to me in the title before I'd even bought the tickets, until I watched Amy Schumer's take on it.

They must come to an unanimous decision of \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" to prevent a hung jury. Their decision has serious consequences since a guilty charge will result in a death sentence. Eleven jurors are ready to make a snap decision of guilty and head home, but one dissenting juror has a reasonable doubt. He prompts the other jurors to examine the evidence more closely.The young man on trial is a minority from a poor background who has a record of minor crimes. The jurors' prejudices and personal experiences influence their decisions of whether the man is guilty. The witnesses had also made assumptions that made their testimony unreliable. It also seemed that the defense attorney (probably court appointed) did less than a stellar job. Was there a reasonable doubt?I first saw this play about ten years ago with the actor Richard Thomas playing the lead role. It's a very powerful play when seen on stage. Recently I read this with a play-reading group, but it had less of an impact. The jurors are not named, but play the parts juror #1, #2, etc, so it's more difficult to think of them as distinct personalities. So I would recommend seeing this play on stage or watching the movie.

I was compelled by the 8th Juror's arguments and by figuring out each individual's demeanor and attitude, I loved discovering more and more about each character as I read about their interaction with other characters. As I continue reading, I'm not only motivated by the ultimate ending and whether or not the boy is convicted, but also by the human relationships. Each argument made by Juror 8 both reveals a hole in the \"evidence\" and a bit about the other jurors. When personal issues aren't supposed to be a part of the judicial system, the reader sees that they can clearly play a role whether the juror knows it or not.I loved this text not only because of it's content in relation to prejudgment of others, but also because it is such a study of human relationships. To me, the play is more about the relationship and interaction between the characters than it is about the eventual outcome. It's a text about relationships that happens to be set in a jury room. Because of this, it's easy to map the text onto another situation as well as relate it to real life. Although the setting provides the catalyst for the interaction, it's possible to find a Juror 8 or Juror 10 or Juror 3 in another text.\"Twelve Angry Men\" provides an opportunity to discuss both prejudgment and peer pressure. Although 11 of the jurors think that they are convinced, it only takes one to question the evidence and present a sound argument to reaveal to the others that maybe they aren't so sure. It only takes one person to stand up for themselves to completely change a group. This text also provides a good way to reference other classes and world events. It can be a segway into the judicial system or the reality of those who are falsely accused and convicted. I imagine that the students will respond emotionally. With 12 characters, the students may sympathize with one over the other. I also think that students' personal experiences will play into their interpretation because the text itself is so personal. Questions: At the bottom of this study of human relationships is also a window into the injustices within the justice system. Although the play is set in 1957, do we still see it same prejudices and clouded judgment in today's society? What about the Scott Petersen or O.J. Simpson trial?What if a different juror had raised the questions that were raised by Juror 8? Would they have reacted the same way to Juror 10's attitude?

Calidad de la representaci\u00f3n aparte (muy buena, con Dan Castellaneta [AKA Homero Simpson en ingl\u00e9s] y H\u00e9ctor Elizondo), la obra es una de aquellas piezas de teatro contempor\u00e1neo que no tienen que ser cantadas para que me gusten.\tEn este caso, se trata de una delirante lucha de un hombre contra la avasalladora opini\u00f3n de sus compa\u00f1eros jurados en un caso de asesinato que parece cien por ciento claro. Al principio este hombre (el jurado #8, representado en la primera pel\u00edcula por Henry Fonda) admite no saber si el acusado es culpable o inocente, sino s\u00f3lo desear examinar los hechos con m\u00e1s claridad antes de enviar a electrocutar a un joven de dieciocho a\u00f1os. Pero poco a poco van surgiendo dudas y dudas, a medida que las personalidades de cada uno de los doce jurados chocan unas con otras y amenazan incluso con llegar a las patadas.\tEl escritor, Reginald Rose, se hizo famoso en su tiempo por dramas que abordaran sin tapujos algunos temas controversiales. Aqu\u00ed el tono versa mucho sobre discriminaci\u00f3n racial y socioecon\u00f3mica y prejuicios opuestos a una fe inquebrantable en que el sistema legal de Estados Unidos, con todos sus baluartes y principios, existe y funciona en virtud de la virtud (v\u00e1lgame la redundancia) de sus jurados. As\u00ed adopta un trasfondo optimista e incluso patri\u00f3tico con su desenlace.

Representada por actores de calidad resulta una delicia dram\u00e1tica.\tNo puedo sino contraponer esta idea con la realidad que nos toca vivir en M\u00e9xico con respecto a la justicia: si un sistema que conf\u00eda en la neutralidad y el juicio de hombres elegidos al azar provoca tantos errores, imaginemos c\u00f3mo resulta uno donde todo el criterio cae en un solo hombre que lleg\u00f3 a su silla mediante Dios sabe qu\u00e9 medios y que se mantiene all\u00ed con una terrible falta de \u2018accountability\u2019.

On the other hand of the spectrum, we have juror 3, a bitter, stubborn and biased man. The play has a very strong message. It's so easy to condemn and judge someone from the safety of our comfortable jury rooms/homes/offices. We're so quick to say \"Guilty\" with just a few weak evidences because it's the simple easy way out. Especially when subjected to the pressure of society. If society condemns something, then why should we fight it? Most of the jurors in the room where not sure about guilty.

An interesting point of this book is that there are no names, only the numbers of the jurors and the witnesses of the case as the 'old man', or 'woman'. These twelve jurors are appointed to deliberate on the trial of a teenage boy who allegedly stabbed his father, and it looks like a open-and-shut case in the beginning, but the evidence that is revealed during the story makes it much more difficult to decide. That story line is only secondary to the actual focus of the play, which is that each juror has his own story that, although never said outright, guides their opinions of the accused and their interactions with the other jurors. Although not necessarily suspenseful, it does hold your attention based on the frequent and drastic changes of opinion and emotion of the jurors. The fun part in reading this was figuring out what personal experiences the jurors brought to the table (pun), and if or how they, themselves changed by sharing an emotionally strained experience. Also, by not having their names ever said, the characters reveal themselves through their characters, and I found myself thinking of them as 'the arrogant one', or 'the nervous one', which helped make understanding the person a lot easier."}, {"userName": "rachel \u2022 typed truths", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17290119-rachel-typed-truths", "userReview": "3.5 starsI find that I truly don\u2019t have much to say about this particular read.

I had heard of both the play and the movie, but I had never seen either one. I was really looking forward to reading it, as I thought my legal background would make it that much more interesting.It did not take me long to completely change my mind. I found it very difficult straight reading, as I was annoyed at having to flip back to the front to review who juror number four or five or two was. The use of numbers instead of names may work well in a theater setting, but it does not work when trying to read the play. I found it hard to keep them straight up until I was about 3/4 of the way through the play.It also did not take me long to ascertain how the play was going to end. It is readily apparent from the beginning that the author takes a liberal view of our criminal justice system. The reasonable and well-spoken juror (Number Eight) thinks the Defendant is not-guilty. The unreasonable, hard-headed juror (Number Three) thinks he is guilty. Number Eight is so reasonable and smart, in fact, that he eventually convinces the others to side with him. There is more to the story, but not much. It was quite a struggle to get through the play, and I had to force myself to keep reading. The book seems to have been written by an idealistic person who knows very little about our legal system. It made me curious, so I read a few things about Reginald Rose and learned, not surprisingly, that he was a writer and had no legal background. However, he claimed to have written the play based on his experience serving on a jury trial for manslaughter. I would be interested to know the details of that trial, because he certainly seems to have written a romanticized account.As you have probably already guessed, I think the biggest weakness of this play is the fact that it is idealistic and implausible. The odds that everyone involved in the trial, with the exception of one juror, missed the fact that the murder weapon was not rare and that a key eye-witness was not wearing her necessary eyeglasses are quite low. Such things are so incredibly basic that missing them seems ridiculous.To be honest, I find this play antiquated, outdated, and over-rated. I imagine it must have been good when it was published and for some time thereafter, but I don't find it very appealing today. There are too many details and points that do not make sense in modern courtrooms. First, jury rooms today are air conditioned. If the air conditioning in a jury room were broken, the Court would most likely find another place for deliberations. It would be too easy for a defense attorney to overturn a verdict on appeal by arguing that conditions in the jury room led to a hasty decision. All of the dialogue about how the room was so hot and how courthouses should not be air conditioned is unrealistic in today's legal scene.Second, none of the dialogue about juror Eight's knife makes any sense in this day and age. That juror would not have gotten the knife through the metal detectors in most courthouses. Even if he got past security, someone in the jury room would have had a fit upon seeing it brought out. What an intimidation factor! Something like that might even be grounds for a mistrial.Of course, there is some value to this play. It raises issues that are interesting and important to students and their futures. Students need to know about our jury system. It is good for them to understand how a group of people has to get together and make important decisions affecting other people\u2019s lives. I suppose our jury system is the ultimate in group-work in the real world.I can also imagine initiating a discussion on whether the jury actually makes the right decision. The fact of the matter is that no one will ever really know. Although it seems that the author wants us to believe that the Defendant is not guilty, there is absolutely no evidence that he is not guilty. The only thing that happens in this play is that twelve men decide that there is not sufficient evidence that he is guilty. I think it is important for students to understand what a jury\u2019s decision actually means, and what it means when we say \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (which is something on which legal professionals cannot agree).I think it would also be interesting to talk about the different personalities in this play. We could have a discussion about how these people developed their personalities and how much conscious choice they have in the decisions that they make and the parts of their personalities that they choose to show others.While I particularly dislike this play, I could actually see using it in a classroom. Although it is not particularly well-written and it is outdated, it raises some fascinating issues that can lead to interesting class discussions. It could also be related to current, well-known trials, in which students are often interested. If I were to teach it, I would not ask my students to do a straight reading. I would assign parts so that it is not confusing and probably show part of the film in class. Because of my legal background, I think that I could facilitate some interesting conversations and create some interesting debates about the subject matter. 2Q 2P"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1732150-sharon", "userReview": "I remember seeing the movie years and years ago, and it being a powerful thing.

I also recall watching the original motion picture, and more recently, I\u2019ve seen the updated movie. I was always really intrigued by the premise: a man is on trial for murder, all the evidence confirms his guilt, one lone juror stands up for him and converts everyone else to a plea of not guilty \u2013 it\u2019s very \u201cHollywood.\u201d It\u2019s been a while though, since I\u2019ve read the actual play.When I first started reading the play, I was shocked at how lost I was initially. Since there are no names, I had to remember juror numbers \u2013 this was a fact I had forgotten since reading it originally. This fact adds a level of complexity to the film (or live performance) because there is a certain unique anonymity in keeping names a mystery. Everyone becomes either a \u201ctoken\u201d character or a \u201cstereotype\u201d in this situation. We start to refer to people as \u201cthe good guy\u201d or \u201cthe angry guy\u201d or \u201cthe inner city guy who knows how to fight with a knife.\u201d This is both a benefit and a detriment to reading a play without character names. While I appreciated the anonymity of the characters from a stylistic perspective, sometimes it confused the hell out of me.Throughout my reading of the play, I kept reverting to my adolescent years when I read or saw the work performed. I was amazed at how incredibly intelligent juror number eight must have been in order to conceive of all the little flaws in the prosecution\u2019s story. My current reading had me asking different questions, like \u201cwhy is a consensus of twelve men in a little room a more objective determinant in how fast a crippled man can walk than actual testimony from that crippled man?\u201d I also began to wonder what exactly we consider \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d How far can you stretch a hypothetical situation before it becomes implausible? I originally cheered for juror number twelve in his brilliant deconstruction of the evidence; now I really wonder whether or not I submitted to his rhetoric like everyone else. Is the whole play just about the potential for converting people\u2019s opinions through charismatic propaganda? Isn\u2019t that what the antichrist is supposed to do or something? Maybe juror number twelve is the antichrist. Either way, he reminds me of Squealer from Animal Farm. But I\u2019m rambling.One thing Rose did well was differentiate the language of individual characters. Even though I was initially confused, after a while, I could generally tell who was speaking just by the words they used and what they said. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but I still had a good idea when juror number three was speaking, or juror number eight. This might be an interesting lesson for high school students. Take a juror from the play, map out his character traits, discuss his motivations, and then create hypothetical statements or situations and infer how he would react. This could easily turn into a writing prompt. For example, \u201cFive years after being found not guilty, the boy who was tried in the play has confessed to his father\u2019s murder. How does juror number three react to this news? How does juror number eight react?\u201dThere is a lot you could do with this play in the classroom. The one major flaw in teaching it, however, is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s effective at all if it isn\u2019t performed in entirety. This play must be read in conjunction with a movie or live performance to have any real substance for students \u2013 at least that\u2019s my opinion. The themes in the work are much more powerful when we can see how the characters react to one another. The culminating argument at the end of Act I \u2013 \u201cnow you didn\u2019t really mean that you were going to kill me, did you?\u201d \u2013 followed by the dramatic curtain drop, is wasted on paper.3Q3P"}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan", "userReview": "Why should Reginald Rose's Twelve Angry Men work? If anything, it starts with what I would have thought a tired premise: jurors -- all men, 12 of them, and fairly angry -- in deliberation. So what?Well, for one thing, \"a man's life is at stake.\"To make matters worse, I'll admit that I am not usually a fan of reading plays. In fact, I was sure that this one, with its twelve nameless characters, would be a real struggle to get through. Who can tie a character's character to a name like \"Juror #8?\" I really don't think anyone is going to read this and say, \"I couldn't believe how stubborn Juror #3 was! He's nothing like Juror #5!\"\"Wasn't Juror #11 so dreamy?\"People just don't say things like that, arguably because we live in a society with named, rather than numbered, beings. Most people aren't very good with names, and numbers are worse, aren't they?At first, I did keep one finger on the page in which the character of each juror was introduced and summarized by Rose. However, by the time I'd reached the second act, I found myself turning back the pages less often. In fact, I also found that by the time I'd reached the third and final act, I had begun to construct faces in my mind for the jurors. Aren't we weird.The plot of Twelve Angry Men, which was basically an examination of the facts of the people's case against a young male, poorly defended, should not have made for a \"fun\" read. But I nevertheless found myself caught up in the case.I guess it just goes to show that even the most mundane details are embiggened by a proper narrative."}], "description": "A landmark American drama that inspired a classic film and a Broadway revival\u2014featuring an introduction by David MametA blistering character study and an examination of the American melting pot and the judicial system that keeps it in check,\u00a0Twelve Angry Men\u00a0holds at its core a deeply patriotic faith in the U.S. legal system. The play centers on Juror Eight, who is at first the sole holdout in an 11-1 guilty vote. Eight sets his sights not on proving the other jurors wrong but rather on getting them to look at the situation in a clear-eyed way not affected by their personal prejudices or biases. Reginald Rose deliberately and carefully peels away the layers of artifice from the men and allows a fuller picture to form of them\u2014and of America, at its best and worst. \u00a0 After the critically acclaimed teleplay aired in 1954, this landmark American drama went on to become a cinematic masterpiece in 1957 starring Henry Fonda, for which Rose wrote the adaptation. More recently, Twelve Angry Men had a successful, and award-winning, run on Broadway.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
