All the while, the \"New American's\" are trying to do the same thing in their fortified small town Jackson Hole. Follow characters you're familiar with and new ones as they continue to fight to survive the zombie apocalypse.Shawn Patton has done the narration for all four installations of this series. Patton just has one of those voices that really bring a story alive. He's able to be a hard-assed special ops man one moment and then that spec-ops guys wife in the next. It's amazing to listen along as he brings Chesser's words alive. I'm always excited when I get an email saying that the next book is out and to see that Chesser and Patton have teamed up again. Even though the books have already been written -- it feels like the words were written for Patton to speak.Very rarely does a series surprise me. Even less often does a series surprise me in the fourth installment. Usually, by this point, I understand the characters and the way that each person is going to deal with new situations. No, not in A Pound of Flesh. Chesser takes what I thought I knew and threw it out the window. That doesn't mean that Cade isn't in it -- or his wife and child, they're all present and accounted for. Chesser just decided to finally dive into what was happening in some of the rest of the surrounding area around Cade.With this expansion of space, he also expands into some new characters, both good and bad. In the fourth installment of surviving the zombie apocalypse we meet the radical New American movement who are currently holed up in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Just their story is fascinating -- and Chesser gives you much more.Like I mentioned earlier, I'm rarely surprised by a series -- especially one that I've enjoyed as much as I've enjoyed this series so far. But the new directions that Chesser is taking the characters and the story is perfect in my opinion. I really enjoyed finding out more and more about the US in the last 9 days since the outbreak started. I feel like the author is slowly pulling the blindfold off of the readers eyes -- not allowing them to see too much too soon, but giving them enough to keep them coming back and back.With the narration done by Chris Patton continuing for the series (as far as I know) I will follow Cade into any adventure he finds himself in the middle of. Well, I know what I'll be doing for the next month or two... I'll be eagerly awaiting the next installment from Chesser & Patton.Want to see more like it -- check out Brian's Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Larry Klemens", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43034838-larry-klemens", "userReview": "Good book in the series Another good book in this series.

If you weren't hooked on the series before, give this book a shot -- I think he'll be able to reel you back in.Audiobook was provided for review by the author."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Book four picks up where we left the prior book. Mike Desantos and crew had successfully set off two nuclear devices to eliminate an extremely huge horde numbering several hundred thousand making their way towards them. Unfortunately Desantos became infected and his teammate Cade Grayson had to put him down to prevent him from turning. In a huge mission foul up the assassin sent to kill President Clay is replaced by a mentally unstable secret agent wannabe who instead kills the lead scientist working on the vaccine, his nurse, and burns the entire lab to the ground. Cade wrestles with his anger towards the assassin who helped kill his friend Mike and destroyed the vaccine putting every survivor in jeopardy. The story continues with a few new survivors and following up with the ones from previous book. A good story, a little long in the tooth at times, but acceptable. I think we need more zombies, less talking."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Lunsford", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14783992-stephanie-lunsford", "userReview": "this book is amazing. just like all the previous book before it!

The character were more consistent in their behaviors. This creates a much smoother read, and it makes the characters more believable. Character development was the main issue in book three, I'm not saying book three was bad, just had some minor issues. If Shawn continues on this route with the next installments, then this series will be a success in my book. I'm off to read the next installment."}, {"userName": "richard b. rupe", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35214005-richard-b-rupe", "userReview": "Great seriesIf you are a fan of the zompoc books this is for you. Great writing ,well developed characters much as I would expect if a super plague were to hit. Having served I like that the military aspects seem to have been very well researched.

Reeling from a surprise attack, and with two fires burning out of control, Schriever Air Force Base goes on high alert. Former CDC Scientist Sylvester Fuentes, the apparent target, is killed along with others. Destroyed in the conflagration was the Omega antiserum Fuentes had been working to perfect and just hours prior had tested successfully on one of the recently infected. Meanwhile, returning prematurely from a mission to set off two nukes in the path of an advancing horde of living dead numbering several hundred thousand strong, and with his Delta Force commander Mike Desantos infected and dying from the Omega virus, Cade Grayson is forced to do something no friend should have to do. As the low rumble of the two nuclear detonations signaling the mission\u2019s likely success rolls over Schriever, Delta Force Captain Cade Grayson begins formulating a plan that will send him hurtling on a collision course with the parties responsible for the terrorist attack. Six hundred miles away near Eden, Utah, Duncan Winters hopes to ride out the apocalypse in his brother Logan\u2019s remote compound. In Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the New American capitol, Daymon Bush, former BLM firefighter, bides his time with one burning desire: to find his girlfriend Heidi even if it eventually kills him. Will Cade successfully lobby President Clay and embark on a new mission in order to extract his pound of flesh for the loved ones he has lost? Will Brook and Raven continue to temper themselves against the horrors inherent to their new world? Will Daymon accomplish his goal and survive Jackson Hole? Will Duncan, his brother Logan, and their prepper friends prevail against the human jackals who are taking advantage of the end of days?
