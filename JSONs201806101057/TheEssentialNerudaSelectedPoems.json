And the reader would cling to it like a kid, fascinated to explore this new world full of wonders. Sometimes he makes you chuckle on the trivial detail looked from such an angel you'd never ever have imagined. Sometimes he leaves us in a mystified fog in heart or a rising smoke of craters of lava. The ocean and his lady love are the recurring visitors in his world. Many of the poems are subtly erotic and one couldn't help but feel how much in love he must be; for following his praise comes his vivid feelings full of love. Intrigued I searched for him and was shocked to know he became politician in later part of life. And that his famous book was published when he was mere 19 years old. Well, I couldn't find the immaturity in the poems. I read other random poems online and would re-read them. I had so much hoped to share some excerpts I had bookmarked but syncing my iPad, I lost many of my books including this one. I'm just short of crying in despair; there were so many books and so much highlighting job I did. I'd recover them eventually but it's a huge loss :("}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "The Chilean Pablo Neruda is officially the sexiest poet ever, which, like, do you think that worked out well for him? It sounds good, but remember - he's still a poet. Being the sexiest of all poets is like being the kindest of all cats, right? I know what you're thinking, you're like what, are you crazy, people love poets, they get all kinds of horny for poets, read a girl/boy a poem and it's like guaranteed sploosh/sproing. But do they really? Ask yourself this: the situations you're thinking of when you say this, where some person or other was entranced by some romantic sexy dark brooding poet, did they happen in real life? Or did they happen in a book? Do you think it's possible that the person who wrote the book also wrote some poems? Are you thinking of Mary Shelley and that's all you got?Here's what poets are like in real life: they are very poor and they want to talk all the fucking time. Also, homeboy looked like thisand then aged into Alfred Hitchcockand if you're going to look like that you had better write some damn fine poetry just to get back to even.But, I mean, this is the dude who came up with this:I want to do with youwhat spring does with the cherry treesso all bets are off at this point.That line is from his first and most famous book, Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, and it's not even in this collection, which is too bad, but there are others from it:I went alone as a tunnel. Birds fled from me,I was invaded by the power of the nightthat make you grab the arms of your chair to hold you down, like you get vertigo, the lines are so strong. Here's that song of despair:\nI no longer love her, it's true,  \u00a0 but maybe I love her.Love is so short, and forgetting is so long.Oh god, right, where did you dig up so much truth? What happens with Neruda is that there's a shift, and from the poet of sex he becomes the poet of revolution. Everything changes for him. People are mad. Where's the sexy stuff? they ask. He explains some things, in a poem called \"I explain some things.\"\nThrough the streets the blood of the children ran simply, like children's blood....Facing you I have seen the blood of Spain rise upto drown you in one single waveof pride and knives!...You will ask why his poetrydoesn't speak to us of dreams, of the leaves,of the great volcanoes of his native land?Come and see the blood in the streets,come and seethe blood in the streets,come and see the bloodin the streets!So that's pretty straightforward. The blood of children in the streets is not sexy and his poetry became less sexy. He became a Marxist and a revolutionary, and he was eventually assassinated by Pinochet, not before winning the Nobel Prize and firmly establishing himself as one of the greatest poets of the century. Here are lines he wrote for his daughter, mortally ill:\nYou stand your ground, chock fullof teeth and lightningThese are dazzling things to say. Neruda's daughter died when she was eight.I like this edition for its variety of translators, and its selection of poems from his whole life. Others will tell you to just go with 20 Love Songs because honestly, we just want the sexy stuff, right? I'm going to memorize some of this in Spanish and whisper it into someone's ear and then I'm gonna have seeeeeeeex, is what you're thinking. This edition has the Spanish on facing pages, so you will be able to do that, but listen: it will not work. You'll seem pretentious, and anyway that person will already have decided whether you're going to fuck or not, based almost entirely on how much they were in the mood to have sex before you even met.

But I also haven't had many. I'm still at a \"greatest hits\" level when it comes to poetry, especially modern poetry. Before Neruda, I would have said Yates was my fave 20th century poet, much more than Eliot, but Neruda eclipsed them by a lot. There's a line in the editor's introduction that compares Neruda's style to red wine. The comparison really stuck with me as I read the poems. They're natural yet dark, the elements imbedded in them, even deteriorating, but becoming richer to the senses for the decline. He's writing about his experiences with love and revolution, yet it seems more than universal- positively elemental. The poems are arranged on a, more than less, chronological level. I found it a bit depressing that the last poems, such as \"The Egoist,\" found the man self-critical for his withdrawal from the world. I felt a bit angry at him for withdrawing, as he had so much power to engage, but also angry at him for being angry at himself. He had given so much of himself to progress, and, in the early 1970s, was sensing early on the decline of the Left's advancements in the world. Perhaps he could not help but take these set-backs personally."}, {"userName": "Krista Baetiong Tungol", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13624574-krista-baetiong-tungol", "userReview": "Who wouldn\u2019t love Pablo Neruda?My long-standing love affair with him started during Humanities class in college, when my professor made us read and interpret \u201cTonight I Can Write\u201d.

The collection gives an overview of his writing over the lifetime of this great Latin American poet. The editor chose eight poets to do the translations. The poems presented include some sensual love poems, and some political poems about both Chile and the Spanish Civil War. He wrote earthy poems about vineyards, gardens, the sea, and the ruins of Macchu Picchu. Death was prominent in some of his works, especially one written as his daughter was terminally ill. He also wrote a series of odes to various objects. I wish I knew more than a few words of Spanish since the original Spanish poems seemed to flow more musically. This is the beginning of Neruda's poem about his vocation in \"Poetry\":\"And it was at that age...poetry arrivedin search of me.

His perspective is an essential one for the twentieth century."}, {"userName": "Chase", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42626916-chase", "userReview": "Pablo Neruda is one of the most influential poets of the twentieth century and in this particular collection of his work, he showcases that through and through. Neruda\u2019s usage of metaphors throughout his work is awe inspiring but it ranges from simple basic concepts to more advanced usages that require advance knowledge over the symbolism that he is attempting to enact in the reader's emotions. You see the simplistic metaphor usage in \u201cI Can Write The Saddest Verses\u201d where the meaning of the piece is quite clear in that he speaks of a lost love. In contrast to \u201cDead Gallop\u201d for example that doesn't necessarily give its point quite as directly as the latter did. The reader then must utilize context clues and pick up on the speaker\u2019s usage of simile to compare what you would think to be uncomparable things.Neruda has a way to consistently leave people in a daze with his words. He is able to invoke powerful emotions with the pen so much that you can picture clearly what he is saying. Out of this collection my personal favorite is \u201cI Can Write the Saddest Verse\u201d. It brings up images of pain and loss to me that I can easily relate to.\tThis is still the definitive collection of Neruda\u2019s work. Here he showcases his diverse talents and his mastery of the manipulation of emotions. My only real disappointment comes from the lack of my favorite piece of his \u201cAnd Because Love Battles\u201d. Other than this small nit picking item this is an excellent collection. As well as a great way for people who may not have read Neruda\u2019s work before to get in to. Tonight I can write the saddest lines.Write, for example,'The night is shatteredand the blue stars shiver in the distance.'The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.Tonight I can write the saddest lines.I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.Through nights like this one I held her in my armsI kissed her again and again under the endless sky.She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too.How could one not have loved her great still eyes.Tonight I can write the saddest lines.To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.What does it matter that my love could not keep her.The night is shattered and she is not with me.This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.My sight searches for her as though to go to her.My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.The same night whitening the same trees.We, of that time, are no longer the same.I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.Her void. Her bright body. Her infinite eyes.I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. Love is so short, forgetting is so long.Because through nights like this one I held her in my armsmy soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.Though this be the last pain that she makes me sufferand these the last verses that I write for her."}, {"userName": "Louisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10378346-louisa", "userReview": "Neruda is perhaps most famous for his One Hundred Love Sonnets, especially XVII.

Sonnet XVII' because of Anna and the French Kiss. I chanced upon a line in Anna and the French Kiss and that COMPLETELY made me certain I had to get my hands on a Neruda piece, no matter what. The line, if any of you are wondering, happens to be a very famous line (sorta, I think!): I love you as certain dark things are loved, in secret between the shadow and the soul. Too beautiful. Of course, I was sorely disappointed to see that in this book, the translation was different. Something like, I love you as certain obscure things are loved... I don't know, I always read it the way I first chanced upon the line. It seems that the translation in this book differs a little from.. I don't know.. mainstream Internet?

Let me just warn you in advance: NO. That's totally untrue. I know literally NOTHING about Spanish (as in, reading/speaking-wise) and really, reading the original lines did nothing much for me except make me very tired. I took really long too, to finish this book, and even then, I'm pretty sure I only took away about 50% of the content.

Neruda's poems are like no other. Nobody is capable of such sensuality through poetry, everything he writes evokes a visceral reaction whilst maintaining a sort of unattainable beauty. Nature, women and love are interchangeable throughout. Unfortunately the poem translations into English lose some of the 'Neruda' about them. Read in Spanish if you can."}, {"userName": "Corey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13689523-corey", "userReview": "In the end, everyone is aware of this:nobody keeps any of what he has,and life is only a borrowing of bones.The best thing was learning not to have too mucheither of sorrow or of joy,to hope for the chance of a last drop,to ask more from honey and from twilight.- Neruda, 'October Fullness'"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6486194-matt", "userReview": "The present moment is the place a poet tries to occupy. Long dead or not yet born? Poetically unknowable and interchangeable. The place that can be illuminated is right now, where all the dead and yet to be born intersect.

I know that reading translated poetry is often an unsatisfactory experience, but I don't read Spanish. Some of the poems were a bit \"clunky\" and I don't know if the rhythms and word choices of the translators are to blame, or if Neruda had his clunky moments.Anyway, a less than transcendent reading experience for me."}, {"userName": "Theresa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2335215-theresa", "userReview": "Having the untranslated poems right next to the English versions made this extra-glorious for me."}, {"userName": "Pamela Ann", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14174968-pamela-ann", "userReview": "Love this!"}, {"userName": "stormie ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3235961-stormie", "userReview": "'the infinite beat of the sea and of doubt...' because. just because."}, {"userName": "Bee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1040603-bee", "userReview": "Nobody knows about love, writes about love, like Pablo Neruda.
