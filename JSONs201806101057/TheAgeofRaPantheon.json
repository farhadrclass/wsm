That is a kick ass cover. So the next time you're in a bookstore, stop and gaze upon its beauty--then return the book to the shelf and slowly back away because that moment, the moment where you gaze upon that glorious golden image of Ra and then wonder at the contradictory image of a modern day soldier in front of a battlefield and think WTF--that's as good as it's going to get, baby.I have put off reviewing this for days because reviewing it seems cruel, like kicking a three legged puppy for not being able to run fast enough. I knew that I was in deep suck by page 20, so it's my fault that I kept reading. And I know, I know--there will be those who say, why did you keep reading if you hated the book so much? A) I bought it, so I felt a misguided need to get my money's worth, B) this is my busy time of year, so reading a crappy book almost ensured I would more readily turn my attention to grading semester finals, and C) I can't count the number of times I have despised a book right up until the very end and something clicked, the other shoe dropped, all was revealed and, hallelujah, it's a literary miracle--the book was amazing! There were no miracles this time. I clapped my hands and really believed, but Tinkerbell never came back to life. This sucker was DOA and should have come with a DNR. Damn, I kicked the three legged dog, didn't I?Age of Ra has an interesting premise. The gods of old are real, they go to battle for dominion over man, the Pantheon of Egypt wins by destroying all other gods. This idea isn't entirely new, but usually these types of books focus on Greek and Roman mythology. The Egyptian slant seemed promising. But this type of book has been done better by Gaiman's American Gods or even Max Gladstone's created mythology in the Craft Sequence books Three Parts Dead and Two Serpents Rise. There are several issues:1. All nations now worship Egyptian deities, but align themselves with different gods (some Asian countries worship Anubis, England worships Osiris, South America worships Horus--you get the idea). These countries now choose their allies and their enemies based upon which gods their chosen deity considers friends and enemies. The god also blesses his or her people with his divine power, or ba, as a power source to charge weapons and vehicles (but, don't worry, if your god forgets to send you some of his mojo, there's still gasoline). This sums up all the interaction the gods have with their people; much of the book consists of military battles that simply throw the gods' names around but really don't rely upon the gods at all. So all that amazing gods-among-men anticipation I had built up was a serious letdown.2. The Egyptian gods defeated all other gods 100 years ago, yet the novel is set in what seems to be roughly the present day. Within a century and in the face of the knowledge that the gods are real, one would think the Egyptian culture and mindset would have radically changed society and redrawn the map. Nope. Apparently not. We still have Russia, Japan, China, and all the other countries and societies speaking and acting as they always have. 3. The integration of Egyptian culture into present day is unimaginative and lazy at best. We still have the United States, but its president is now known as the Pastor President. We still have Britain, but its head of state is now His Pharaonic Majesty. We still have Mercedes Benz, but it's now known as the Mercedes Lotus. We still have tanks, but they're known as Scarabs. The world-building is weak.4. It's also laughable that, in a world that still has high tech weaponry and alternate fuel sources, our hero enters combat with a crook and flail. Or that mummies so clueless they make zombies look like the life of the party are sent into battle against tanks and artillery. Or that high priests use wooden birds to carry their consciousness for reconnaissance missions, but, if that fails, they send out the planes we would normally use for reconnaissance. Because a high priest in a trance forever is always preferable to the intel a plane could send back in a fraction of the time. The inclusion of modern technology in the book renders the Ancient Egyptian inspired tech moot and useless by comparison.5. Cardboard, stereotyped characters so one-dimensional that they make the Kardashians seem human; an obligatory will-they-won't-they romance with less passion than a Liza Minnelli marriage; plot twists so obvious they practically nudge you (\"You'll be so surprised! You'll never guess what's going to happen! Here it comes, here it comes! Did it get ya?\").6. The best part of the book? The gods. One can tell that Lovegrove really did his research here and he's smart enough to realize that the gods have to adapt and change somewhat to move the plot forward. Holding them to their archetypal roles would have added little interest whatsoever. As Ra begins to develop a consciousness outside of his divine role and manipulate the Pantheon to avert disaster, it's easy to think something might be salvaged. However, the god chapters are too few and far between (and ultimately anticlimactic) to add much to the narrative. There was an idea here, somewhere beneath all the problems, but it never delivers on the promise presented by that beautiful cover.Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder"}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "A hundred years ago the Egyptian gods defeated all other gods and now reign supreme over the earth. Dividing the land up amongst themselves, their feuds and squabbles and hatreds reflect on earth amongst the mortals. Thousands of men and women join their deities' armies and navies, their service and sacrifice the ultimate worship. Lieutenant David Westwynter is a British soldier of Osiris. Having barely escaped with his life from a trap in Petra, Jordan, he knows his only hope is reaching Freegypt, what was once Egypt, ironically the only country in the world the gods haven't laid claim to. Once home to all, none of them want to fight over it, and it is the only independent, non-religious land left.There David falls in with a beautiful aloof woman called Zafirah and her Liberators, freedom fighters who are part of a larger movement within Freegypt. Their leader is a masked man called the Lightbringer, who turns out to be more than he seems in more than one way.As the Lightbringer's vision of freedom from the warring gods and a plan to fight back brings unity to Freegypt's people, so Ra, the sun god, seeks to unify his squabbling descendants on the godly plane. With so much history and hatred between them, he despairs of helping them change and forgive, and stop the wars among their human followers on earth. But as with Freegypt, the one person who can unify the gods against a common cause is the Lightbringer, and only David is in any position to speak reason to this revered human seeking to bring a new age to the world - and discover who he truly is.At its heart, this is a simple story, simply told. The prose was refreshingly unpretentious (I confess, I do expect some pretension from sci-fi), without the superficial need to clutter its sentences with techno-gabble or other made-up words. I loved the ending too, the scene in England, which neatly summed up the \"message\", if you will, of the story.Now, I decided not to spoil the first revelation, simply so I could discuss things more openly, but I will say this: the first revelation is very predictable, and you'll guess it early on because it's quite obvious. That's mostly because the story's so neatly laid out, and things that need to be prefaced, are. I don't hold that against it though. In a way, it read like one of those satisfying Hollywood movies, and indeed is structured much the same way, with the exception of the scenes amongst the gods, which added another, intriguing layer.While David doesn't narrate, his is the only human perspective we get, and the style is noticeably different from how the Lightbringer talks to him in private - it's a nice display of inflection and syntax, showing skill and craftsmanship at work. There's more to Lovegrove than \"meets the eye\", so to speak. The simplicity of the prose and the neatness of the story work because the author is skilled, but it's like this iMac I'm typing on: the clean, smooth, almost featureless exterior hides a great deal of clockwork inside. (Not literal clockwork - you get me.) I was intrigued by the premise, and I would have liked to understand how it works more. The gods are very very real, here. But how humans got caught up in obeying their dictates, doing their will, was never quite clear. And the world beyond the wars - that I would have liked to have seen. I guess it's no different than ours, really, aside from the different way countries are aligned.At the end of the day, The Age of Ra is deceptively simple, and has a gentle yet poignant message about power and religion that is easily heard because it is not preachy or moralising. This isn't a story about religion, or who is right. I won't try to sum it up. I'm still pondering."}, {"userName": "Bob Milne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2224905-bob-milne", "userReview": "Okay, I admit it - I'm a sucker for a pretty face, a hot body, and a flashy book cover. This one caught my eye and, on a whim, I decided to pick it up.If the cover was the tease, then the premise itself was pure temptation. Imagine a world in which the gods are real, in which they've gone to war, and in which the ancient Egyptian ones have defeated all others. Odin, Zeus, Allah, Jesus . . . all of them, dead and gone. The major powers of the world are still at war (yeah, like that's a surprise!), but under the banners of their own patron Egyptian gods. So, you've got men and women armed with ancient weapons (flails, maces, and sickles), modern weapons (guns, tanks, and planes), magical weapons (god-powered staves and bombs), and even armies of mummies resurrected from the battlefield.Most of the book follows the adventures of a British Lieutenant, sole survivor of his platoon, who is rescued from the brink of death and taken to Freegypt - an atheist country that doesn't answer to any of the gods. There he encounters the Lightbringer, a masked revolutionary who is leading the atheists of Freegypt into battle to destroy all of the gods. Of course, all is not what it seems, and motives in this war are no more pure than any other.Ultimately, what sets the books apart from just another Stargate clone are the scenes involving the gods themselves. Lovegrove plays with the stories of the Egyptian mythology and weaves them into his tale very nicely. Incest, bisexuality, homosexuality, and shapeshifting deception all play a role in the petty conflicts that ultimately drive their earth-bound armies.Fun, exciting, and sometimes even profound (without being preachy), this a book worth picking up."}, {"userName": "Beryll Brackhaus", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6005211-beryll-brackhaus", "userReview": "I gave up on this book halfway through. Which really was a pity. I LOVED the idea. When I stumbled across the description of the book I thought there couldn\u2019t go anything wrong with such a fun idea. But apparently a bad author can ruin even the best of ideas.I am hard pressed on where to begin with all the faults in this book.It has little to no plot. When you reach page 160 and STILL nothing has happened you know something is seriously wrong.The mortal characters range from cardboard boring stereotypes to stupid asshole you DON\u2019T want to read about.The gods range from stupid stereotype to ridiculous.The author seems to be seriously homophobic, featuring two gay rapists in the course of the book and repeatedly stating how his main characters would never do such horrible things.He also shows some stereotypes that are bordering on racist in the way he presents them \u2013 including a Greek sailor who \u201cis really, really not gay\u201d and a Japanese suicide pilot.He writes endless monologues to tell back story that go on and on and on and give the words monotone and boring new meanings.His combat scenes are chaotic and he clearly can\u2019t handle keeping track of several characters in an action scene.The romantic sub plot seems like edited in as an after thought.Basically the only thing he does right is that he did some research into Egyptian culture and neatly inserted bits and pieces into his modern world like the school\u2019s senet club (instead of a chess club)In short \u2013 the only really good thing about this book is the idea. I wish someone more competent had written this. Would have loved to read that."}, {"userName": "Nicholas Karpuk", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1574263-nicholas-karpuk", "userReview": "I don't often say it this bluntly, but this book is heartbreakingly stupid. What's that you say? Heartbreakingly isn't a real adverb? Well, that didn't stop James Lovegrove from employing them on such a routine basis that it actually made me laugh after a while. The prose is hilarious, but that's actually the least of my problems here. The big, glaring problem here comes from the absolute waste of the premise.Age of Ra is a world where the Egyptian pantheon killed off all the other gods 100 years ago. It really doesn't go much farther into that than I just did with my previous sentence. This suggests that around the time of World War 1 a burly brawl went down between two different religions. Which just goes back to that old chestnut of writing advice: \"Is this the most interesting part of your story? If not, why are you starting here?\"The setup could be really fun in competent hands. This is not in competent hands.The thinly sketched out rules create some of the problem. They suggest that there's only two ways to really kill a god:1. Convert all the god's followers.2. Kill all the god's followers.What little history we get suggests the second option. And if you're a fan of history (Lovegrove really doesn't seem like one) you might not that killing off a religion is kind of hard. Most religions die out to competing religions that prove more popular. Violent force often tends to entrench people in their beliefs. And several of the gods they supposedly kill are in some of the most widely published books on the planet. Ra would kill off Jesus, then the guy would pop back up a week later the moment someone found a copy of the New Testament. Both Jesus and Muhammad would keep appearing like Droopy the Dog in those old cartoons.And the thing about this world is that the gods directly make themselves known to humans. They grant them gifts and powers. So it's less like how religion works, and more like having a supernatural president residing over your country.Because the pantheon divided up the Earth. You'd think, since they did it about 100 years ago, that there would be a ton of changes, but no, they mostly left country names and cultures, everyone just has Egyptian themed military gear. Beyond not understanding religion, he also apparently didn't work that hard on the world building or the gods themselves. These characters are thousands of years old, but the way they talk suggests that they haven't done anything new since Egypt was conquered by the Roman Empire. It leaves the impression that the author grabbed a children's book about Egypt and called it a day. There's no new stories, almost no real history of their interference on Earth or why the religion didn't die out, and apparently they just spend most of their time arguing on Ra's god boat. But I could forgive most of this if the main story had some fun energy to it. It does not.It involves a special forces soldier named David. Davids screws up his mission in the Middle East and nearly dies when his unit gets caught. Through a whole lot of serendipity he ends up in Freegypt (sigh) and joins up with the Lightbringer, a man with a following who wants to kill off all the gods.And if that plans seems stupid based on the rules outlined above, that's because it is. It's a very stupid plan and no one should have been convinced. If you want a comparison of how stupid this plan is, imagine either converting every American into atheist or killing them. Doesn't really sound manageable, does it? The Lightbringer's plan would require 20 times that effort.There are two big twists in this story, and they're both on the big list of cliched twists that no one should use anymore.The first is when a character is secretly related to another character. Shockingly (SHOCKINGLY!) the Lightbringer is actually Steven (all hail Steve the Lightbringer!), brother to David. (I'm not spoiler tagging this, because it's the conflict through the majority of the novel.) So yeah, in a country of mostly brown people, it turns out that the most of the action centers on two rich, white guys from England. It's a white man's burden story line worthy of Edgar Rice Burroughs.This was the point where it all really started to fall apart for me, because it's the point where dialogue became more of a feature, and the dialogue in this novel is consistently atrocious. Steven in particular is so obnoxious that it became almost unbearable. I only have one requirement for dialogue in a novel: It should sound natural or be enjoyable. I don't require both, but I need one or the other, and this book suffers on both levels. Everyone sounds like a petulant child regardless of age, and even the gods sound like obnoxious teenagers.Here's a direct quote from a god in this story: Horus glares back at him. There\u2019s enough venom in his one eye to fill two. \u201cWant me to rip those balls of yours off again? I\u2019ll happily do it, you ginger freak. Come on.\u201d He clenches his hand at crotch height, gripping an imaginary pair of testicles. \u201cJust give me an excuse.\u201dBeyond that, there's a level of needless machismo to both the main characters that didn't help matters. Here's a smattering of awful quotes:The two Liberators folded their arms. David reckoned he could take them down pretty easily. Though both were stockily well built, neither radiated the calm, ready-for-anything aura of an experienced fighter. Street muscle. They would go for obvious blows \u2013 face, chest, belly. He would jab at nerve clusters and soft spots \u2013 throat, eyes, genitals. No contest.Nobody called David Westwynter a coward. Or even implied it.We became firm pals, the two of us. And I know what you\u2019re thinking. A Greek sailor, and lithe, well-muscled young me. Well, belay that foul thought, big brother. It wasn\u2019t like that. None of that sort of thing went on, no hanky-panky belowdecks.\u201cHow you\u2019ve come round to the Lightbringer. How close the two of you have become. He\u2019s always conferring with you.\u201d David nearly blurted it all out then: That\u2019s because he\u2019s Steven, he\u2019s my brother, my long-thought-lost little bro.AND DAVID SLEPT. Profoundly.That last quote has nothing to do with my point, it was just too funny to leave out. The other twist that really bothered me, because it's a feature in every AAA video game I play now, was the third act betrayal. In a crappy story, a trusted figure always betrays the protagonist in the third act. In games, it's an excuse for you to fight a different enemy. In books, it's mostly just lazy.What's upsetting overall is the wasted premise. There's about a dozen different perspectives I'd rather have explored this world through. How about someone who actually has to deal with the worldwide politics of a pantheon controlled world? Or someone more integrated into a countries culture?It's just so much more infuriating when the potential exists."}, {"userName": "Colin McKay Miller", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/739464-colin-mckay-miller", "userReview": "James Lovegrove\u2019s Age of Ra is an unholy deuce. One hundred years ago, the Egyptian gods killed all the other gods. Now, present day, different parts of the world follow different Egyptian deities, and a man called the Lightbringer has had enough of their abuse. Oddly enough, the one part of the world free from the grasp of the Egyptian gods is Egypt (wut) or, as they call it, \u201cFreegypt\u201d (ugh). Thus, after British Soldier Lt. David Westwynter\u2019s crew is ambushed, he flees there and finds himself drawn into a bigger war against the gods. When this novel was suggested for Book Club, I thought, all right, cool; kinda sounds like \u201cStargate\u201d\u2026 but it\u2019s not anywhere near that. Early on, I agreed to turn off my brain and treat it like an action movie. That kind of thing will happen when the author gleefully describes a man\u2019s head lighting up and exploding during a fight sequence. My brain continued to stay off when David ran into mummies and he casually hated their apparent common presence the way Indiana Jones hates snakes. I also ignored the first two times David was saved from a tense situation by a random outside force. When it happened a third time (read: every time there was any conflict), I called it quits.You know what you didn\u2019t see in the above section? Egyptian gods or anyone fighting with them. You know, the entire reason you\u2019d read a book like this. I mean, they do show up in rare, italicized chapters. Surely they do awesome, cool god things, right? Maybe they even smite non-believers into fountains of blood and bone? Nah, they sit around and chat like self-indulgent losers from JD Salinger novels. Again, Lovegrove supposes that all gods are real, that they somehow had a great Godzilla-like fight a hundred years ago, and instead we get this novel about an inept solider getting saved from every fight he loses. Was Lovegrove afraid of offending religious people? I mean, I guess he\u2019d already be there if he\u2019s saying Jesus and Buddha and L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s clones are all dead and stuff. Then again, I don\u2019t worry about the theology of sci-fi, especially not from a dude who thinks gods are somehow fueled by the worshipful attention of believers (psst, Simpsons did it).In meeting with my Book Club, I lamented the crap storyline clich\u00e9s that had already shown up and made a guess as to how the novel would conclude with those who finished. Surprise! I was right. Not because of my great analytical skills, but because it ain\u2019t hard to follow tropes to their pre-set conclusions. I guess that will happen when the author acknowledges he was paid to write this book\u2014the kind of motivation that births any great artistic endeavor. The best part? Apparently Lovegrove was paid to write six of these books, and all of them rehash the same story with different gods. Now even if one of the belief systems settings did sound interesting to you, I couldn\u2019t recommend it from this guy. One star and, dear God, keep the other five away from me."}, {"userName": "Cathy ", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526945-cathy", "userReview": "It was good. For the first half I was reading at such a nice pace that I was reluctant to put it down; not an exciting page-turner, but a smooth read that held my attention. Other than skimming some of the military and battle descriptions it was an easy read with a nice flow. I like the parallels between the story of what's happening on Earth and what the gods are up to in their realm. It's an interesting new take on the traditional tale of free will versus divine intervention. It also included quite a bit of Egyptian mythology that was new to me and very interesting. There really are only three major human characters. The woman, Zafirah, is barely sketched out; she is given a few points of depth but really is only there as a foil for the men. David, our hero, is relatable and interesting despite is British way of being disengaged, a manner which haunts his ability to relate throughout the book as well as our ability to relate to him. Overall he's a guy most readers will easily recognize but may have different takes on how he should have behaved. The final character, the Lightbringer, llluminates much, sometimes more than expected. The relationship between David and the Lightbringer is the heart of the human level of the novel, just as familial relationships are at the center of every interaction between the gods. There are some nice ironic political and social parallels drawn to our current world as well, using which god has claimed which earthly territories and how those religious affiliations impact the political and social natures of the subject nations. It was also ironic to see this world's Egypt being a sort-of anti-Israel; it's the birthplace of the worldwide religion yet the one place on the planet that every nation has agreed to leave unreligious and exempt from external military pressures. What kept tripping me up as it got near the end was that I knew it was the first in a trilogy and I couldn't see how the two books I've seen could fit together. I have The Age Of Zeus here and the are sounds parallel, not sequential. A bit more research revealed this quote from Lovegrove's website, \"Together the three will form a kind of trilogy, although none is a sequel or prequel to any of the others. The links will be thematic rather than narrative.\" (http://www.jameslovegrove.com/news/40...)\".

The idea of a world in which the Egyptian gods have destroyed all other beief systems and essentially rule the world is a pretty clever idea. The main thrust of the story, a group of non-believers,led by the faceless 'Lightbringer', attempting to overthrow the gods themselves, is an interesting and engaging story. I foun the main character,David Westwinter, to be a pretty enjoyable, if unoriginal,character. He acts as the everyman in the story, and through him we learn most of the backstory to this world. With a worldwide theocracy, though of many competing factions, Lovegrove does take some time to address te idea of what our world would actually be like, and shows some nice parallels and divergences from our own world. My problem with this book mainly lies in the execution of the plot, particularly towards the climax of the story. I felt it was just too... uninspired. The buildup was pretty good, but the end itself jut fell short. There's a parallel story involving the gods themselves, and although much of that is also enjoyable, there's a critical question at the end that's never answered. Or perhaps it was, but with the rest of the plot turns spelled out in capital letters, this seemed an unnecessarily oblique 'answer'.

The character development never seems quite plausible, and the meshing between worlds--well, it left me unsatisfied. Perhaps I have read too much Percy Jackson or Harry Potter, but conventional armies with mere allegiance to opposing gods just doesn't measure up.

And I have to say \nThe Age of Ra by James Lovegrove\n was unique. Chose it partly 'cause of the cover and partly cause of the title; I'm a sucker for Mythology and anything related with mythology is good enough for me and then their was the added bonus of the story being of a sci-fi-military-utopia vs. dystopia centered story, my favourite genre. So read on....Here is how the summary of the book goes like:The Ancient Egyptian gods have defeated all the other pantheons and claimed dominion over the earth, dividing it into warring factions. Lt. David Westwynter, a British soldier, stumbles into Freegypt, the only place to have remained independent of the gods- influence. There, he encounters the followers of a humanist leader known as the Lightbringer, who has vowed to rid mankind of the shackles of divine oppression. As the world heads towards an apocalyptic battle, there is far more to this freedom fighter than it seems...There is an ancient belief that pretty much explains the story of The Age Of Ra; \"As above, so below\" from the alchemical text, The Emerald Tablet. For the follower of ancient hermeticism this expression holds the key to all the mysteries of the universe. For the follower of ancient hermeticism this expression holds the key to all the mysteries of the universe. Hermes Trismegistus, the author of The Emerald Tablet, saw it as a key to open the magic inherent in the world. The ultimate meaning of the adage is that the macrocosmos is mirrored in the microcosmos and that God is the same as man.Mr. Lovegrove clearly uses this idea in his tightly crafted novel where he creates two worlds. Earth far in the future, where the Egyptian Pantheon have defeated all other gods and divided the earth into warring factions, each aligned with a god from the pantheon; and the pantheon itself, with all its petty struggles and jealousies.Primarily divided into the two level - the divine level and the Earth(the above and below). If it is to be differentiated more specifically then it tells four tales with four parallel arcs within this format. First, the story of the gods and their movement in the pantheon. Second, the personal tale of the godly struggle between Set, Osiris, Isis and Nephthys. Third, the war between the worldly factions and their struggle for dominance. And finally the personal struggle between Lieutenant David Westwynter, a British soldier, and his younger brother Steven.It is ultimately all about theocracy, fratricide and sibling rivalry, both on earth and in heaven.Well if you look closely at any mythology around the world it is present, the only difference between the various pantheons is that they named differently as according to the regions from where they originate from.So after the Earth is divided among the Gods and Goddesses Europe belongs to Osiris and Isis, the US to their son Horus, Asia to Set, Africa to Nephthys and Japan to Anubis among the major gods. Ra abdicated responsibility a while ago and now wanders the Earth and the Heavens with his mythical companions, while the First Family is mired in pleasure after ensuring their supremacy so the grandchildren and their children \"rule\" the Earth. But as we know from mythology they do not form quite a happy family, with such matters like Seth killing Osiris and cutting him into small pieces, Osiris seducing (or being seduced) by Nephthys and in consequence Anubis' parentage being debated, so on Earth as in Heavens, Europe is allied with the US like parents and son, Asia is allied with Africa like husband and wife, but Set mistrusts Nephthys too, while Japan sort of stands aloof with its famous \"death pilots\" as befits followers of the underworld God. There is progress but there is continuous war too and Ra tiring of strife tries to engineer peace.Meanwhile on Earth, David Westwynter is a special operation officer in His Pharaonic Majesty Service on a covert mission in Arabia that goes wrong. A golden boy and scion of the famous game manufacturing company founded by his grandfather to capitalise on the immense popularity of Senet once the Egyptian Pantheon won, David has always been the protector of his rebellious younger brother Steven while his rich parents washed their hands of him. When Steven enrolled in the Navy and died in an Aegean battle, David finally rebels too and joins the Army as a grunt, though he soon rises to be an officer.Egypt as an \"independent\" country does not fare that well since there are warlords in the Upper Egypt while the government in Cairo has little more than nominal control outside its immediate environs. However in recent years a masked stranger called The Lightbringer who is rumored to have mysterious powers arrived in Upper Egypt and managed to unify the warlords in the name of \"freedom\". One of his main aides is Zafirah, a fierce woman of the desert whose father was a famous warlord who died in battle.I confess the book at first felt a bit slow and confusing to me since i don't have much patience with military-centric novels but it started to get much more interesting as i leaved through the pages but was starting to see the bigger picture. Lovegrove is a good writer and he immediately establishes the rules. The novel is told from the point of view of David Westwynter; it is a tightly-constructed narrative with a no-nonsense prose style. The British commandos are an elite fighting group and we are on solid military science ground here, following the team to the rendezvous point. However, Lovegrove quickly lets us know that he is not writing a standard military science fiction novel. Our first clue is that the men carry Ba weapons and the battle locations are ancient locations, re-animated to a future context. And by the end of the chapter, the mummies arrive. Even though Lovegrove clearly employs elements of myth, horror, and science fiction, the novel doesn't feel like a post-modernist junk with him hurling new words and terms at us.Text from wikipedia : The Ancient Egyptians believed that a human soul was made up of five parts: the Ren, the Ba, the Ka, the Sheut, and the Ib. In addition to these components of the soul there was the human body (called the ha, occasionally a plural haw, meaning approximately sum of bodily parts). The other souls were aakhu, khaibut, and khat.The 'Ba' (b3) is in some regards the closest to the contemporary Western religious notion of a soul, but it also was everything that makes an individual unique, similar to the notion of 'personality'. (In this sense, inanimate objects could also have a 'Ba', a unique character, and indeed Old Kingdom pyramids often were called the 'Ba' of their owner). Like a soul, the 'Ba' is an aspect of a person that the Egyptians believed would live after the body died, and it is sometimes depicted as a human-headed bird flying out of the tomb to join with the 'Ka' in the afterlife.There is mythology, \"Englishness\", philosophy, friendship and family and what are our duties to both as opposed to society's demands and how do we reconcile such when in conflict? While David starts as a sort of an enigma and he grows a lot on us, he remains a \"quiet\" main lead since The Lightbringer and his story steal the show from the moment we encounter him. Zafirah is more of a standard character - the young woman with a drive that becomes a warrior and leader of men - but she has some unexpected depth and her relationship with both the main leads is very well done too. And then of course there is the Heavenly thread and there the author just shines with larger than life and memorable characters in all the major Gods above and their doings. While there are some hints about their powers and reach, Mr. Lovegrove - wisely in my opinion - does not try to explain everything and bring the novel within pure rationalism with alien super-beings, so in that sense the book is partly a fantasy too. Not that it matters since however you label it, it is still great stuff.To Lovegrove's credit, The Age of Ra offers a fast-paced, action-packed story which benefits from its setting in an alternate timeline in a number of ways. One is that its background is more conducive to this sort of adventure than the increasingly implausible scenarios on which more \"realistic\" writers in this vein have relied since the end of the Cold War. Another is that, compared with the diffuse storytelling that characterizes most of that genre, Lovegrove's greater freedom in setting up the situation enables him to keep the focus on his central figures.It helps, too, that the material is spiced with exotic speculative touches, including the interweaving of the demented intrigues, vendettas, and powers of the Egyptian gods in with the terrestrial action. Additionally, even if Age of Ra is less ambitious than some of the works mentioned above, Lovegrove's book still touches on its fair share of Big Themes (not the least of them, the problem posed by a messianic figure playing freedom fighter) while presenting a good many twists in the obvious course of things, making it something other than a simple tale of heroic rebels confronting an intolerable tyranny against impossible odds.Readers familiar with much ancient mythology can hardly object to the daytime talk-show trashiness of his gods as uncharacteristic of such beings (indeed, Lovegrove's bluntness about their comedic-like repugnance refreshingly reflects the myths as these must appear to objective modern eyes), but that still leaves a large part of the story hanging on the conflicts of a fairly shallow bunch.Additionally, conducive as the broad premise is to this type of adventure, Lovegrove's world-building also struck me as surprisingly thin in places. Westwynter's desert adventures do not show much of the wider world, but his memories, and such details as the reader can gather from his present, give an impression of a slightly skewed modernity overlaid with ancient Egyptian images, symbols, and tropes rather than the more thoroughly transformed global culture one might expect to see. Westwynter's upper-class, public school upbringing, for instance, seems to be pretty much what it would have been in our world, except that the Anglican clergy who would have seen to the spiritual side of his education speak of Osiris instead of Christ. Even the geopolitics of this world echo our own in significant ways, as in the use of an Anglo-American covert action in the Middle East in the opening.However, such similarities seem reasonable enough given the late date at which the world changed over to the worship of the Egyptian gods\u2014and in any event, an alternate history does not have to be convincing as a historical counterfactual to be effective. In fact, the similarities are the point in many instances, Lovegrove emphasizing this by playing off of them in interesting ways, as in his presenting secularism's last bastion not in the West, but in the Arab Middle East, or the thinly veiled commentary that is his depiction of American \"Pastor-President Wilkins.\"Where the gods are concerned, Lovegrove's depiction of them in their element\u2014Ra on his boat, Anubis in the underworld\u2014has its poetic moments in its fusion of fantasy and science. However, the reader is given little sense of how they coexisted with other deities in a common cosmology, or what this means for their role in the creation of the universe that every mythical pantheon claims as entirely its own work. At the same time, there is virtually no explanation as to why this particular group of gods and goddesses, the weaknesses and disunity of which are all too apparent, managed not only to defeat all of their rivals, but to fully eradicate them from the cosmos after being marginalized for so long. After all, Lovegrove's tale makes quite clear what happens to deities who do not have the benefit of vast numbers of devoted worshippers. I'm sure you all remember the strategy based game \"Age of Mythology\" - well this felt just the same but in a modern way.This is a unique story in a unique setting. The characters are interesting and the novel reads fast and furious. However, I felt that the climax and ending of the book were a bit flat \u2014 too many things fit entirely too well for how things were worked out. I was also able to predict a good bit of the secrets revealed to the reader well in advance. I would not recommend this book for younger readers as there are a few sexually explicit scenes."}, {"userName": "Richard Webb", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17378665-richard-webb", "userReview": "The setting is an alternate modern-day world, in which the existence of ancient gods of is undisputed: their existence is a fact. The Gods have waged a war and those of the Egyptian pantheon were victorious and rule the heavens, fighting amongst themselves for dominion over the world of humankind. Cleric-politicians claiming direct communication with deities hold sway over international affairs; tensions boil over into military conflicts\u2026 everywhere except Egypt itself, which the gods have decreed a No God's Land, hence its moniker Freegypt. However, gods do not always keep their promises and a religious war comes to Freegypt, where enigmatic humanist leader The Lightbringer is challenging The Gods. Into this scenario is thrust soldier Lt. David Westwynter, through whose PoV the tale unfolds.The inclination to worship The Gods or not provides the story with its fuel. This set up an intriguing premise which is not explored: what happened to other religions and their deities? Would their followers be destroyed too or would worship continue in underground cults/sects? Would there be a new modern-day pharaoh chosen by the Egyptian Gods? Lovegrove chooses not to engage in more philosophical issues, preferring to hold to the action.The world is confidently depicted though it is sketched rather than painted in detail. The rousing opening with its 'Stargate-esque' feel pulled me in, and it was in the scenes of military engagement that Lovegrove excelled, injecting a page-turning urgency. But this lightness of touch in the action scenes did not serve as well when more emotional heft was required so the major relationships in the book lacked complexity. This also came through in the easy willingness of the Freegyptian people to follow into war (with The Gods!) a man in a mask\u2026but perhaps expecting verit\u00e9 in such a rambunctious setting is missing the point.Westwynter should carry the reader's skepticism toward events but at times he is a little underwritten \u2013 an archetypal 'thinking soldier' with no individual quirks: smart, but not too smart, (he should have guessed the 'twist' far sooner than he did); rigid in his rule-observance; conscious of his family's reputation, and willing to throw his life into a cause. That said, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with Westwynter: his motivations have logic even if they are telegraphed and he has as much character definition as most blockbuster lead characters have; after all, this is the territory we are in here.The lead female character Zafirah was similarly underwhelming. Whilst I commend the author for eschewing 'hot-pants kick-ass' clich\u00e9s, she strayed a little towards a different sort of clich\u00e9: hot-headed, passionate, exotic, tough-but-vulnerable. This made her romance with David -- particularly after her obligatory initial coolness towards him \u2013 less than compelling. There are interludes from the PoV of the Egyptian god-father Ra, depicting the intrigues of the pantheon. This lent the book a more epic context whilst at the same time giving it the feel of a soap-opera amongst the not-so divine ... which I suspect was entirely the point. These sections have a folkloric feel: the narrative voice is effective in its simplicity, but the flip-side is that there is little nuance in the depiction of The Gods and their inter-relationships. Perhaps that is the point -- gods are one-dimensional beings, more symbolic of an aspect of humankind's singular traits than sharing our multi-trait complexity (eg. The god of war has a bad temper). That is fine, but if so, the 'gods are squabbling children' insight might not be enough to sustain interest in the other books by Lovegrove in this series ('Age of Aztec', 'Age of Zeus'.) Whilst the scenes of The Gods were integral, they became intrusions more than enhancements as the climax of the main story built. The intrigues of both the divine and empirical worlds were over-simplistic but for the most part this was glossed over by the verve of the storytelling. The notion of 'real gods' is a compelling idea, so it is a shame that Lovegrove seems reluctant to explore it further, as if an attempt to do so would result in questions that couldn\u2019t be answered\u2026but perhaps therein lies a more enriching book.For a quick and mostly engaging read, this serves well, though tends more to the bubblegum end of the fantasy spectrum, at its best when all guns are blazing but less comfortable in the quieter moments."}, {"userName": "Vixie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65052392-vixie", "userReview": "The Age of Ra was a book I picked up on a whim, mostly out of curiosity for the plot. My sister enjoys Egyptian history, knows her Gods and Goddesses and quite a bit of the lore, so I was tempted to pick up the book mostly to tell her the plot at a later date. I have not told her, because this book was a tedious read, at least for me. So, what can I say. I am writing this review a little while after I've read the book but I remember the majority of the story. So, let's begin. The story begins with a team of soldiers, British, airdropping into hostile territory to meet an ally or informant. From the start the story kind of reminds me of Stargate SG1, the cross over with modern technology and the concept of energy weapons. To be honest, my watching Stargate and my sister's fascination with Ancient Egypt is probably what helped me make sense of the book otherwise I would have been confused from the get go. To be honest, I was still confused, it wasn't until sometime later that I realised they were identified by the Gods each country worshipped. Anubis apparently favouring Asia and Australia and England worshipping Osiris, for example. The idea of an ancient Pantheon of Gods taking back power from modern deities was not a terrible one, but I was quite disappointed from the get go. The people seemed diminutive, weakened, their faith in the Gods replacing progress and moral standing. In the modern world we investigate and we learn but in this book we saw the people blindly believing in the Gods, using the Gods as an excuse to commit evil or justifying the unjustifiable by saying a God willed it. (Seem familiar?) What seems like a good looking, in-depth book, turns into a book about one man\u2019s doubt. David Westwynter, the supposedly last heir, the eldest son to an influential and rich English family is the leader of the British team parachuting to a foreign and hostile land. With just two basic weapons, a crook and flail, he is facing hostile enemies in a desert where rescue may not come and where there are few friends. Of course, like with all stories he is deceived, or betrayed, it doesn\u2019t really matter which. One by one his team dies, tortured or by suicide until only he remains. He intends to commit suicide himself but due to exhaustion he faints and shoots the camel of some passing Bedouin people. In this story the Bedouin people are not portrayed in a favourable light, they are painted as murderers and one man a paedophile who rapes the little boys of the camp. And for a time, it seems David is doomed to be sold as a slave or prisoner to his enemies. But of course, our hero can not end up in such a situation and miraculously some rebels find the Bedouin and raid their camp. David is saved, albeit it unintentionally. He basically falls in love with his rescuer, a woman who only has vengeance in her heart, it seems. (What is it with these stupid love stories, huh?) He tells her of his missing brother, a troubled soul who became lost at sea. (If you can guess where this is going then you have a good head on your shoulders because it is pretty much obvious looking back on it now.) But anyway, he is taken to see the rebel\u2019s figurehead, a man who always keeps his face masked, a symbol of the light and of how man can and should be free from the influence of the Gods. The Gods themselves are not just ideas in this tale but real things, as fallible as us humans but worse because they have such influence over the weak-minded and power-hungry. It is through them that the world is at war, because Gods are rarely symbols of peace and are more a symbol of dominance and war. And of course, Egyptian Gods are some of the worst, affairs, bastard children, torture, manipulation and so much more, (For the sake of staying on point we\u2019ll ignore the Roman/Greek Gods, Aztec Gods and more other deities). And Earth, subjects of the Gods, play out these arguments eternally, humans paying for the Gods treachery with their own lives. And the Gods see it as nothing but a game, the human life as valuable to them as a rat\u2019s life is valuable to us, in other words we are toys and pests to the Gods, nothing more. It soon is revealed that the symbol of the light has a God on his side. A holy being who is leading man to freedom, perhaps?HA!It is very obvious how this story will end. With betrayal and stupidity. David chooses to stay away from his family and home, indulging in his taste of freedom to join the rebellion. The leader of the rebellion, the figure of the light is none other than someone David knows very well. I\u2019ll give you one guess who that is. We\u2019ve all seen plots similar to this before. And of course the Figure of the Light has the support of a very familiar God, a minor one who has ideas above his station, for who would dare challenge the Egyptian Pantheon and the Almighty Ra? And so, we find out at the end of The Age of Ra that humans are the subject of God rule and the only time we\u2019ll be free from the tyrannical, biased, flawed rule is when the greedy, self-serving deities choose to step down. But who in their right mind would? I know many men and women who\u2019d never let that sort of power or influence go once they have a taste. Of course, Ra is more compassionate, he realises an eternity of hate is neither good for his family or humanity (Let\u2019s ignore that it took him an eternity to realise this and that it must have cost billions of lives before he realised this) and he seemingly steps down bringing an end to the Age of Ra. Not that we see this, instead we are left with rather ineffective ending. David\u2019s brother is definitely dead by this time and David is supposedly in a long-distance relationship with his female rescuer/comrade. The Gods still rule but he comes across a disguised Ra who offers a few words of wisdom and speaks of the end of the Gods. Of course, the fact that Ra ran off and left the Gods to feud it out means that the end of the Gods is far from being anywhere near, if anything the war between the Gods and therefore their countries of influence will go on forever without interference. Therefore, nothing really happens. There is a war, rebellion, the crushing of the rebellion and a rather dull ending that doesn\u2019t really reveal much. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting when I picked up this book, but this was not it. I am an atheist, I can understand how religion can be a tool for self-realisation and comfort but more often than not I see it as nothing but a tool to excuse ignorance and hatred and this book was a representation of all I hate about religion. Blind faith, an excuse to cause harm and chaos that had no true reason or just cause. If anything, this book was a saddening read, and although at some points I admired Ra for his attempts to bring peace amongst the Pantheon I felt little else but boredom and distaste. For what it is worth, the concept was sound, but I have to admit that I\u2019d probably not continue to read this series, it was not to my tastes and was a poor choice of reading on my part. While I would say it was a terrible read for me, I recommend everyone read and make up their own mind. Do not let my personal and biased opinion affect your choice on whether you read this book or not. But if you are anything like me, you will be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Michael Caroselli", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21085469-michael-caroselli", "userReview": "I found this book in a secondhand bookstore's science fiction section. The cover made me pick it up and the synopsis was interesting enough to warrant a read. While the author does create an interesting universe in which the fate of nations is determined by Egyptian gods, many of which have absolutely no concern for morals, the story ultimately falls flat. Flat is really the best way I can describe this novel. The characters are flat, static, and uninteresting leaving the reader detached from the human conflict in the story. Also, it doesn't help that only about half the story is dedicated to the human conflict with a large chunk of the novel switching between the main human character and his struggles on Earth and a rivalry between gods in their divine habitat at each new chapter. The relationship between the main character and his love interest/military ally is unfulfilling and left me wanting to know more after the novel's conclusion. The gods' conflicts amongst themselves quickly becomes a sibling rivalry of sorts and is boring and tiring to read.There is a lot of action in this novel. The author generally does a good job illustrating the futuristic armies and weapons and he keeps the action interesting. Or perhaps, the action is all the keeps the story interesting.

The Egyptian gods really don't play a major direct role in the story and wind up being more of a subplot. They have little, if any, interaction with their mortal followers, but this is a plot point that provides motivation for some of the characters and not an author oversight. The majority of the book is focused on the military action, initially focusing on one of Osiris' British followers. The action keeps the book moving forward and I found very little lull in the story.

Either way, I enjoyed the book and I was pleasantly pleased by the next installment as it seemed that the author had truly gained his stride."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22698340-robert", "userReview": "A surprisingly fast read, this book makes the reader question how much of human will really is due to humans themselves.

I initially came across it at the bookstore and didn't pick it up; while the concept was interesting, the cover art made me wary that it would be a typical war/adventure novel wrapped in a fun concept that would disappoint me. I ended up picking up another book, which I later found out that I already had; I returned to the book store, got a credit, and decided why not, I'd give this a chance.I'm very glad that I did.The gods of ancient Egypt have returned to earth, defeated every other pantheon, and asserted themselves as ultimate deities of the world. They assert their will on the hapless mortals below, who must obey their whimsy. There is one place in the world spared their influence, Freegypt; and from Freegypt springs a leader who promises to lead the world out of the influence of the gods. I can't truly say much more without giving away too much of the plot.I read over some of the other reviews for this book, and I truly can't fathom a few of the complaints. I'm not sure what book they read, but it apparently wasn't this one. It's a well crafted story, blending action, mythos, a bit of mystery, and a tiny splash of romance into one exceptionally entertaining story.I love the way that the author portrays the gods. Anybody who has studied the pantheons of the ancient world will understand why, when reading this book. Unlike the modern monotheistic faiths, the gods of yesteryear were more human-like, and thus relateable to their believers. They had strengths and weaknesses, personalities, desires, whims, and just about anything that a normal person would have had. Lovegrove does all of this justice when he writes the segments about the gods, truly highlighting the complex relationships that each deity had with one another. I don't know about you, but I like my gods as relatable and understandable, instead of some aloof guy on a cloud somewhere.What I adore about this book, and I haven't seen anybody else mention so far (though I could just have skimmed over it) is that the author seems to be using this context to bring to light how religion dominates our world just the same way that it does in this one. Replace Horus with Yahweh and Osiris with Allah and you still have the same story of god commanding his followers to go blast the crap out of the followers of a different god. What I think is brilliant about this is that to most readers, the idea of Osiris, Isis, Anubus, Set, etc sending mortals into a never ending war to satisfy their needs to force their worship on the world seems silly and far fetched to most readers, yet if you turn on the news a good chunk of what you'll see in international affairs is Christians killing Muslims, Muslims killing Jews, Jews killing Muslims and so on, so forth. This book seems like a brilliant way of highlighting that no matter what god you follow, it all boils down to the same thing in the end. And, for this, I commend the author greatly. The only complaint I can fathom to come up with about this book is that I wish he'd gone into more detail on the backstory. He establishes that the Egyptian pantheon overtook the other pantheons, but doesn't really go into how they did it. I feel that could have made this story a whole lot richer. It would, likely, have effectively doubled the length of the book, but I wouldn't have minded reading how each god took influence over a segment of the world, or how they actually defeated the other gods. If there is one thing about the world that we know for sure, people don't give up on their beliefs easily. I'd liked to have seen how the gods made the people switch from Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and all of the other faiths to belief in just them.Even with this minor fault, I highly recommend this book. It was a great read, and I was able to fly through a hundred or more pages in one sitting by how engrossed I was in it."}], "description": "The Ancient Egyptian gods have defeated all the other pantheons and claimed dominion over the earth, dividing it into warring factions.
