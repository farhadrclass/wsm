We fret and worry and waste unnecessary time trying to remedy situations in which we have no business and where our perfectly powdered noses don\u2019t belong.What we must do is determine the difference between being conscientious (our part) and being in control (God\u2019s job).We intellectually believe he does what is best for the world in general, but practically we behave as if in our individual situations, we still know what\u2019s best.there is vast freedom in pursuing a life lived out of our own control.As Jesus went through his earthly life, he had a plumb line\u2014 a solid starting point of reference on which he based all of his decisions. It was straightforward and uncomplicated: he came to do his Father\u2019s will by glorifying him while on earth (John 17:1).So when it comes to a purchase, an activity, an event, a friendship, a hobby, or a pastime, I ask myself, \u201cIs this a tool, a toy, or a tangent?\u201dAfter more than forty years of being female, I have come to a bold and harsh realization: Someone is always going to rearrange my building blocks. Or move my dolls. Or alter my circumstances. Or disappoint my child. Or mess with my schedule. Or paint a picture of my character, however false. And oftentimes I really have no say in the matter.Our only solution is to cultivate the gentle art of acceptance, of learning not to ask \u201cWhy me?\u201d but rather \u201cWhat am I supposed to learn at this junction of life that will make me a better person and draw me closer to God?\u201d We shouldn\u2019t pout, asking God to get us out of the circumstances. Instead of crying, \u201cLord, get me out of here!\u201d we should instead be praying, \u201cLord, why have you brought me here?\u201dWhen we willingly accept our lot in life, welcoming all that God is trying to teach us through it, we lose the drive to over- control, to micromanage in an all- out attempt to appear perfect and ensure everything in our lives is \u201cjust so.\u201dAs a result, our nerves will be calmed. Our stress level will deflate. Our tasks will be less about work and more about worship. Our decisions will become easier. We will experience more joy and be strapped with less worry. Past experiences will begin to make sense. Our present will seem more doable. Our future will actually begin to come into focus. The pretense of perfection will fade away, and a stunningly striking authenticity will be reflected instead. Life becomes not about self but all about the Savior.I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s more important to recognize and praise effort and diligence than outcome and performance.We can mentally ask ourselves questions that will empower us to maintain calm emotions and keep a healthy perspective. Questions like \u2026 \u201cDoes it matter now?\u201d \u201cWill it matter tomorrow?\u201d \u201cWill it affect eternity?\u201d \u201cIs God trying to teach me something? If so, what?\u201d \u201cCan I pause and praise instead of interrupt and instigate?\u201d \u201cIs there really an issue here that needs addressing with my child?\u201d \u201cAm I just being a control freak, and do I need to let it go?\u201dCounsel is giving advice and guidance in a gentle but direct way that helps the person seeking the instruction. Counsel is not barking. Counsel is not belittling.Yes, we should be conscientious, giving counsel; but we should not be controlling, or complaining with criticism.The fire doesn\u2019t ignite suddenly when the question is posed or the rule is broken or the household way isn\u2019t followed. Its kindling goes waaaaay back\u2014 back to expectations and perceptions.Amy Carmichael first uttered this concept: \u201cIf a sudden jar can cause me to speak an impatient, unloving word, then I know nothing of Calvary love. For a cup brimful of sweet water cannot spill even one drop of bitter water, however suddenly jolted.\u201d 3Say yes because you feel called, not because you consider yourself capable .Seek margin. And space.changing our circumstances rarely changes us.Esther is the scriptural role model for how to control what you should and trust God with what you can\u2019t. And, more importantly, how to decide which is which!When we even subconsciously think we can control the situation and the outcome but fall short, we may succumb to situational depression. We must remember that God is God and we are not. We must look to him for our role in the scenario being played out. How should we respond? What should we do? How should we pray?fast from other things\u2014 like talking about the people involved in the situation,Decide where to glance and where to gazeGod is waiting eagerly to respond with new strength to each little act of self- control, small disciplines of prayer, feeble searching after him. And his children shall be filled if they will only hunger and thirst after what he offers. Richard Hollowaythere is the real issue. What is best? Do we always know? And how do we know the difference between what we should try to control and what we should let go of?Soul control is when we speak God\u2019s truth to ourselves. Soul control is when we recognize that life isn\u2019t fair\u2014 that others who seem evil prosper, while the righteous seem to flail about. Soul control is when we pause to remember our place. And God\u2019s. Soul control is learning to idle our brains before we engage our mouths, thereby saving ourselves a boatload of heartache, wounded relationships, and regret. Soul control is when we stop\u2014 sometimes midsentence\u2014 and realign our thinking and resulting actions with God\u2019s Word. Soul control is when we finally realize that it is only God who has sole control over the universe. We do not. And even though it appears that sometimes people, or even Satan, control the situation, they don\u2019t. Soul control is a fresh dose of perspective amid the turmoil of life that can transform a control- freak woman (who has wounded only with her words perhaps, but killed nonetheless) into a woman who, like transformed David, follows hard after God\u2019s heart.What does God want me to learn about him that I might never discover if he were to suddenly pluck me out of this situation? \u2022 What Christlike character traits is he trying to grow in me\u2014 patience, trust, compassion, faith? \u2022 Who is watching\u2014 either up close or from afar\u2014 and discovering what God is like by my reactions to my current situation? \u2022 How might my empathy for others deepen if I go through this current trial with grace and acceptance? \u2022 What is God trying to say to me, not by the outcome, but through the voyage?Father, may I learn the secret Paul knew and live it well. I want to be content in whatever circumstances you place me instead of trying my best to wiggle out of them. Teach me to look for you in the midst of what might seem a less- than- lovely situation. I want my heart to no longer be disturbed or disquieted but instead to be confident in and content with you and you alone. I know you already know what is best for me. Help me to see and know it too.

It. Go and Let God!!Let me begin by giving you a brief description of the new book, Let. It. Go. By Karen Ehman. \u201cMany women are wired to control. You're the ones who make sure the house is clean, the meals are prepared, the beds are made, the children are dressed, and everyone gets to work, school, and other activities on time. But trying to control everything can be exhausting, and it can also cause friction with your friends and family. This humorous, yet thought-provoking book guides you as you discover for yourself the freedom and reward of living a life 'out of control,' in which you allow God to be seated in the rightful place in your life. Armed with relevant biblical and current examples (both to emulate and to avoid), doable ideas, new thought patterns, and practical tools to implement, Let. It. Go. will gently lead you out of the land of over-control and into a place of quiet trust. A companion video-based study for small groups is also available.\u201dI am not ashamed to say that I am this woman, the woman who has to be in control of everything, and if I am not in control, I will go crazy. After reading the first chapter, my toes hurt from stepped on by Karen\u2019s words. Karen tells us in on page 13, \u201cWe Women crave control.\u201d She goes on to describe how we are born with this and we are ready to take charge of everything.Karen uses humor, stories about her life and as well as stories about others to teach us how to LET IT GO and to LET GOD have control. It is definitely not something that will happen overnight but takes time. She also includes inventories for us to read and circle how we rate those activities or personalities. I really enjoyed the chapter on our schedules and how we should think about how busy we are and how each family members activities affect each other. I love how Karen says, \u201c Being busy is the new measuring stick of family success.\u201d This made me realize just how busy my life is, girl scouts on Tuesday\u2019s, Church on Wednesday\u2019s, Church on Sunday\u2019s and whatever else comes up. I really need to be praying about activities before I take them on and stop controlling what my family does.I truly recommend this book to all women, young or old, it truly is a teaching tool that we can use to teach our daughters, and granddaughters about letting go of the control and keeping our faith.\u201cI received this book from the publisher/author for my honest review.\u201dhttp://zondervan.com/9780310333920"}, {"userName": "Dana Rongione", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6291998-dana-rongione", "userReview": "I came across this book while searching for a book by another author, but as soon as I read the title, I knew it was a book I needed to read. I, like so many other women I know, struggle with letting go. With so much to do and so many responsibilities resting squarely on our shoulders, we women often act as if the entire world would crumble if we were to give up a single ounce of control. Besides, we're not doing such a bad job with this balancing act we call life. . . or are we? When we're stressed and frazzled, gloomy and grumpy, there's definitely a problem, and the problem is that we're trying to do everything, which simply isn't possible.With a dash of wit and a sprinkle of personal experience, Karen Ehman tells it like it is in Let. It. Go.: How to Stop Running the Show and Start Walking in Faith. She confesses to being a card-carrying member of Control Freaks Anonymous (an organization I know all too well) and explains how the Lord has taught her to let go and let God. I could relate to many of the situations Ehman referred to and learned some valuable lessons on how to release my white-knuckled grip on life and its many circumstances. Several things truly hit home with me, so much so that I jotted them down in my devotional journal so that I could remember and meditate on them. But I think the thing that hit me the most was this paragraph: When we women try to be so on top of things--around the house, at work, in our marriages, in our parenting, and in community ventures--we think we're only taking our jobs seriously, performing our tasks with care, and carrying out the duties of our roles in a way that is excellent and thorough. So give us a break. We really are just trying to please God, right? I thought so. Sometimes I still think so. However, I happened upon a thought just a year or two ago that makes me wonder this: In attempting to be in command and control, are we trying to be godly or are we trying to be God?That statement was definitely an eye-opener for me because I was playing the \"godly\" card on a regular basis. I chalked up my overly-controlling habits to a strict adherence to the verse, \"God is not the author of confusion.\" But, Ehman has a point--a point that will stick with me for years to come.I definitely enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to any woman who struggles to let go of the control button and simply enjoy life."}, {"userName": "Ginny B", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6723683-ginny-b", "userReview": "I have to admit, before I started reading this book I really thought, \"I don't have an issue with control\". For those of you who know me...stop laughing! Yes, I am one of those who is \"wired to control\" and I honestly don't even realize when I am doing it most of the time. I bet you don't either.In the book Karen identifies four disguised control types in addition to the loud, boisterous, and dominating type. They are: the soft-spoken saint who says yes to every request whether it inconveniences her or not (YES! that really is a form of control!), the enabler who either runs interference or does damage control when loved one's actions affect others, the victim or martyr who controls through a well-timed pout or the occasional sigh, and the people pleaser who's actions gain unspoken favors allowing her to get her way when she wishes. The common theme is that we all have a false notion that control works. And we do, don't we? Otherwise we wouldn't be doing it.The book is broken up into three sections. The first helps us to see our own controlling side and to perhaps understand the \"why\" behind it a little better. Karen gently, and sometimes humorously, walks us to the truth that it really doesn't work, and that is is actually quite harmful to both ourselves and those we are trying to control.The second section focuses on control issues in our families. With a chapter on managing our husbands, our children, our home and our schedules she covers it all. I love that Karen is honest and doesn't present herself as the gal who has all the answers and has done it right for FOREVER. She is down home, sitting at the sticky kitchen table over a cup of coffee, girlfriend chatting honest with us. She shares her failures and her successes and reminds us above all that we are on a mission for GodThe final section is an awesome look at what it means to lose control and keep the faith. Karen uses Biblical examples of what it looks like to let God lead the way and yet still not sit on our hands saying, \"huh uh...not my decision, I don't want to be in control\". Drawing from the stories of Queen Esther, David, Paul and others we see how letting go can line up with letting God.I have to say this was a truly eye opening book that has helped me to make some changes in my life."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Jo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3627659-rebecca-jo", "userReview": "When I saw there was an online Bible Study with Proverbs 31 Ministries, I decided to give it try. I've never done one of these online Bible Studies & interested to see how it would go.I actually didnt even know much about the book. Being a Wunner (Combo runner/walker) for years, maybe I just saw the words \"running\" & \"walking\" in the title & thought, it'll work for me. I didnt realize the top would about control & our little control-freak attitude that we carry as women.Once I got the book & saw what the topic was about, I thought, this isnt going to be for me. But I bought the book & willing to see how it would work out.Well, within the first chapter, I think it was the first clue on how much 'control freak' I have in me. After all, doesnt everyone get upset when their husband leaves cabinet doors open? Or when there's mail on the counter that I didnt lay down? ... yep - control.Each of the chapters really dug into different areas of the places we want control - with spouses, family, with busy schedules, within the home. Every chapter was eye opening to me & all the while, speaking the truth of the Bible & what God has to say about that.My scripture journal became full of verses that I'll hold dear now. I even had my past 3 memory verses for Beth Moore's Scipture Sisters straight out of this study.Karen Ehman has a way of stressing the point in an every day fashion. One I could relate with & understand. & easily ties it back to how God calls us to live. With only HIM in control.The ending of the book, with the story of Karen's sister-in-love & the struggles she's going through with bone cancer & the difficulties she's experienced - it was moving. She is living in a world where we would all want to fight with control, but this beautiful woman is just going where God is moving her & thankful for everything in her life... even the tough stuff. That's who I want to be.. THAT's why God led me to this study.Now, I'll be working on the challenge of the book... letting it go"}, {"userName": "Heidi Strybos", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15267080-heidi-strybos", "userReview": "I used this for devotions over last few months.

She then talks about some ways to combat those tendencies, with Scripture to back her up. Along the way, the reader realizes that Ehman wrote this book as much for herself (a confessed control freak) as for others. With that in mind, the prime target audience of the book are other women like Ehman, married women with children and a full-blown type A personality. Therefore some of the chapters are specifically on how to watch out in married life or raising kids that you aren't being a control freak and causing more harm than good. I felt like Ehman could have reached a broader audience with this book. Not all women are type A control freaks (and Ehman really assumes all women want control), and not all type A control freaks are married women with kids. There are guys and unmarried women who need to be reminded to hand the reins over to God in all areas of life too. But I do get that Ehman is writing what she knows (which always makes for a stronger book). So in picking up or recommending the book, recognize that it is written for a very specific target audience. I think I would have given it a higher rating if it had been broader. She did have some great ideas, illustrations, and reminders about holding things with more open hands but I felt like there would have been a better book out there for me personally since I don't completely fit the target audience."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/551880-stephanie", "userReview": "The perfect book for a perfectionist, Type-A control freak who moved to Africa and some days just wants to push the \"reset\" button and head back to the U.S. There were some very important lessons here about relinquishing control, embracing the \"whatever\" (less-than-perfect) and finding contentment in all circumstances.Some things that spoke to me:* We are only in charge of obedience.

Armed with relevant biblical and current examples (both to emulate and to avoid), doable ideas, new thought patterns, and practical tools to implement, Let It Go will gently lead you out of the land of over-control and into a place of quiet trust.", "title": "Let.
