There are a few differences though. 1) This book is written in third-person, Zooey speaks in first-person. 2) I can pronounce the name of this book. How the heck do you say Zooey? Is it Zoe-y or Zoo-y? I'm stumped!3) I can't hold Zooey Deschanel up at eye level with one hand.*4) I'm not secretly in love with this book.5) This book does not have a restraining order against me in West Virginia.6) This book will not see the error of her ways someday and run off to Tahiti with me for topless romps on the beach.Other than that they are EXACTLY the same and you should read it if you are a sinner. And you are. THREE STARS!Love,Rico* This is not to imply that Zooey is fat or that I am feeble -- au contraire! She has the wispy figure of a dainty hollywood starlet and I am building up my core strength through my own modified Pilates regimen! I took a basic Pilates class and made it my own. I mean, come on, The 100s??? I can't do those! Who am I, Olga Korbut? Nobody can do The 100s. I do what I call The 8s. All part of my almost-famous Four Minute Pilates** -- bend into a few poses that would make Tomas de Torquemada wince, feel the intense pain known as \"the burn\" or possibly a muscle tear, wipe down, then get on with your life.

Usually, there are a few tidbits of information that are applicable to your situation; you make leave with a little handful of thoughts to concepts or metaphors to guide you, but application is often difficult to understand since most books speak to certain circumstances or concepts.Experiencing God works to improve the foundations of every Christian's relationship with God. There are a few short chapters toward the end that give specifics to different areas of live, such as marriage, parenting, career application, and ministry, but the majority of the book is focused on how we as believers can best respond to God's call, and learn to hear His voice more clearly through prayer and obedience. The purpose is to come to a position of practical and personal faith in our walks with the Lord.I learned a great deal through my study of this book. I came to better understanding of the relation of faith and works as well as the contrast between obedient faithfulness and conjured faith (in which we attempt to will ourselves into hearing and believing God). I have come to a greater desire for prayer and knowledge of how God speaks to me and answers prayers and it has already begun to reshape the decisions I make. This is certainly not a book that will lead to a more prosperous or cheerful life, but it will help you better to understand how to understand and follow God as His servant and His child."}, {"userName": "M. J.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8391431-m-j", "userReview": "My constantly shifting schedule shifted, enabling me to get to church a few weeks in a row, and my regular class was studying this book--nearly finished, but they did not begrudge me the last copy, and I attempted to catch up. Thus although it took several weeks to complete less than three hundred fifty pages, to some degree I felt I rushed through it--and that is unfortunate, because I think it is a book from which the benefits best come by a slow process of absorption.Those benefits arise because this seems to be an important balance to much of the way Christians, individually and collectively, think about how to do God's will. It brushes aside all the concepts of rational evaluation, of seeing whether something is in the budget or whether we have the right people for the job, in favor of trusting God to accomplish what He directs. The author has made a career and indeed a life from doing exactly that, of listening for God's direction and going that way without regard for how impossible it appears to be. It certainly bears repeating that if you know what God wants you to do, you should do it, and let Him worry about the details--and the costs.By the time I'd reached the middle of the book, though, I had a concern--probably the only concern I had through the entire reading (well, there were a few places where I thought scriptures were misapplied, but I always think that and in the main this one was pretty good on that count). I felt as if the author were saying that our rational wisdom should be discarded, that we should never attempt to figure out the best path or the right path, but merely ask God to point us in the right direction and trust Him to lead and make it possible. I was asking myself whether my concerns were justified, not from the perspective of whether that was what the book was saying but whether I was wrong to think that God gave us minds to think through our options. The use of our minds to solve problems was reaffirmed for me in a parallel study, and so I am confident that we are indeed at least sometimes to follow the path that seems wisest to us, with its budgets and planning and organization. The book is in that sense unbalanced, because it never concedes that there is any way other than to listen for God and do as He directs, or that there might be any time in life when God would not answer the question of what to do next. Yet that imbalance may be a strength, as I see it as very unlikely that the average Christian today would completely surrender his own wits and wisdom even when that was the right choice, and Blackaby gives a solid foundation for doing so, for seeking guidance that might not be fully rational from our perspective, and following it in trust.I intend to read it again, probably more slowly; it strikes me as the best book on prayer that I have encountered, and particularly on prayer as dialogue, and that is a lesson into which I would delve more deeply. I may first surrender it to others in the house or beyond, for their benefit, if they are interested."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10770790-kevin", "userReview": "I found this book to be slightly annoying. Blackaby is extremely repetitive throughout many of the chapters--he often restates the same idea three or four times in a paragraph (he'll lead off the paragraph with it, state it another way in the next sentence, ask it in a question, then restate it in a conclusiony sounding way as if he's demonstrated his point). His use of biblical texts and personal stories is also a bit suspect. He tells us to not rely on experience then heavily relies on it throughout almost all chapters. He also states that there is no formula to help us know the will of God but then essentially attempts to come up with a coherent formula in many chapters to help us discern what God is leading us to do. At times it seems like he is prooftexting in order to establish his points. Overall, this book is a restatement of the common (and, in many ways, unhelpful) discourse Christians use when talking about 'the will of God.' When he focuses on actually experiencing God in our daily lives, he has many good points; however, much of his writing focuses more on determining God's specific will for our lives. A much better treatment of issues relating to knowing God's will for our lives is Kevin DeYoung's Just Do Something. Skip Experiencing God and read that instead, its a much better use of your time."}, {"userName": "Zack", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5906027-zack", "userReview": "I normally do better with reading books than completing workbooks, so I read the book form of Experiencing God. Blackaby is very thorough with his points, an important characteristic of a good communicator when utilized correctly. I love his emphasis on a personal love relationship with God. If you don't have that, you're not going to hear anything from Him! We hear from God when we get to know Him and how He speaks, and the only way we can do that is by spending time with Him. Read the Word. Pray. Seek Godly counsel. Watch how He is working around you. Blackaby's ideas are at times revealing of his personal theology, but he makes a convincing argument in their favor. I will definitely walk away from this book confirmed in my belief that Almighty God uses people to accomplish His will on the earth, a concept that I don't fully understand but fully appreciate. I encourage all of you to enter into a personal love relationship with Jesus Christ so that He can involve you in His work! That is where true glory is given to God and true satisfaction is found in us."}, {"userName": "Greg Dill", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3674676-greg-dill", "userReview": "This is one of my all-time favorite Christian books ever written. This book was recommended by my pastor as a book to help me better understand and distinguish my own will from that of God's will. Blackaby succinctly and methodically introduces a Biblical way in how to better understand and hear God speak to us. God speaks to us through His Word, through prayer, through circumstances, and through other people. And it is through all of these avenues that inevitably led me into full time ministry serving as a missionary to an unreached people group in Albania."}, {"userName": "Ashleigh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3066688-ashleigh", "userReview": "I've been reading this book daily for the last 6 months.

Our church's pastor plans to have a study of the current edition, so I thought I would get a refresher on the revised and expanded content of this version, published in 2009. ----From the Publisher: The Experiencing God ministry is even more vibrant today than when it began. As it continues to rise, and the world continues to change, the Experiencing God book has been revised and expanded with more than forty percent of its material newly written. A modern classic that has sold millions of copies worldwide, Experiencing God is based on seven Scriptural realities that teach us how to develop a true relationship with the Creator: 1. God is always at work around you; 2. God pursues a continuing love relationship with you that is real and personal; 3. God invites you to become involved with Him in His work; 4. God speaks by the Holy Spirit through the Bible, prayer, circumstances, and the church to reveal Himself, His purposes, and His ways; 5. God\u2019s invitation for you to work with Him always leads you to a crisis of belief that requires faith and action; 6. You must make major adjustments in your life to join God in what He is doing; and 7.

I'm glad we made that decision. While I found some of the phrasing and applications in the book to be a bit awkward, the overall premise is certainly helpful.

A good reminder that our relationship with God, is that, a relationship! What I got most out of this book is that we, as Christians, are called to a 'love-relationship' with God and, if we really want to experience God in our lives and ministry, we need to ask Him where He is working and be part of that.

Blackaby and Claude V. King, is another in a series of Study Guides I have been thoroghly happy to have read. This guide takes the reader through a series of expectations that anyone who reads and studies the Bible through easy to understand stories and Scripture.  This book allows the reader to first read the text, followed by going to their Bible and looking at the full Scripture being discussed. It also allows the reader to gain that fleeting knowledge and apply it to their everyday life.  As this book begins, we are first introduced to the Chapter \"Knowing God by Experience\". One of my favorite quotes in this chapter is that of the Lord as Provider. \"We can know about God as a Provider as we read the story of Abraham. But we really come to know God as Provider when we experience Him providing something for our lives.\" Just think, as we experience God, in the truest sense, we develop a closer relationship with God. He does provide.  \"Experiencing God\" is yet another selection that should be part of the Christen Library.

We sometimes misunderstand what it means to be productive in our calling, especially when our efforts are not showing fruit. Have you ever found yourself in a church or parachurch org where God is blessing others, but not your sacrifices? Yet you know you are in the right place doing what you are called to do! Blackaby helps us see how God's timing and our willingness to follow Jesus is always a blessing. Our search to please God doesn't always lead us where we think we are going. You might find yourself at a dead end or climbing the wrong mountain. Blackaby gives many examples of how our well intentioned yet less productive paths have led us to wonder what to do. This book shows how at times we find God's will right under our nose. The more I apply myself to His Kingdom the more I learn about His Faithfulness to His calling on my life."}, {"userName": "Michael Vincent", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19606832-michael-vincent", "userReview": "Though there are many things I like about this book, I also found it confusing and frustrating. I find it unfair to use many unique experiences the patriarchs and prophets had in the OT as paradigms for our own experiences today. I also felt like sometimes the authors relied upon circumstances to hear God's voice, and other times they shared that we should not rely upon circumstances. I truly believe God leads us today, and can work uniquely with His people, but have personally found it difficult to know when God is actually \"speaking,\" when He has never audibly spoken to me as He did with many in the Bible. However, as they also teach, we do honor Him as we seek Him in prayer, and walk according to His revealed Word. We must trust His sovereignty and grace as we trust in the Lord with all of our hearts."}, {"userName": "papasteve", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74362-papasteve", "userReview": "This book was just OK. I had the congregation read it, a chapter a week. We've been working on it since January, and finally finished it this week. Part of the plan was that I'd write sermons each week that went along with each chapter. That went well, and I think people got more out of the sermons than the book. The chapters were repetitive, and could have been compressed better into fewer chapters. I didn't agree with some of the theology, and let my people know where I didn't agree and why. For the most part, it made the people in the congregation think about their relationship with God and where they were at with that.

I did not get a lot out of it that already wasn't covered in other studies. A lot of examples and information about planting churches, becoming a missionary, or being called to the ministry. However, there were practically no examples of how to apply these principles to those of us who are Christians and not in religious vocations. Also, the author talks a lot about people getting called by God and how God's messages to us are obvious and often. That has not been my experience as a Christian.

Blackaby constantly points out that God's will is not given to us as a to-do list and that His will is always to reveal Himself to us and work His purposes through us.
