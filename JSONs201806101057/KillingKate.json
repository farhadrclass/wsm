Now that can be tough on a 28 year old let alone add the fact she fits the exact description of the women in her small town being strangled to death at night. Call her paranoid (I know I did) but Kate starts to suspect that she's being watched and perhaps she's the next victim that caught the eye of our serial killer. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I disliked this novel so much. Was it the overly simplistic writing? Sure. Underdeveloped characters? Maybe. Obvious villain? Not a great sign when you figure out the antagonist in chapter one but its not a deal breaker for me. Or is it the clearly formulaic writing style? I don't thinks so, if I was going to write off a novel every time it followed an obvious formula I would never be able to read a book in the YA genre again.No there was something more, something that borderline irritated me with how this novel was portrayed and then it hit me. This novel treats its readers like they are IDIOTS. Its patronizing. Every point made, every twist concocted is then thoroughly explain as if we the readers are unable to draw basic logical conclusions. In a word this novel is completely void of any form of subtly. It feels as if everything is spelled out in big bold red letters, surrounded by flashing lights and then followed by a DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW IDIOT? Maybe this is more my pet peeve then others but I do not like to be talk down to in the books I read, as if the author has to dumb down every point and then repeat it more carefully and slowly so I, a lowly reader, am able to understand the genius that is their writing. Give your readers the credit they deserve. After reading the brilliant Big Little Lies just over a week ago it is clear that there is a right way and a wrong way to write about domestic abuse. The severe juxtaposition of the handling of such a sensitive issue just made me appreciate the brilliant complexity that is Liane Moriarty's writing, and unfortunately just showcased the amateur-ish writing of Alex Lake, and that they bit off more then they could chew trying to tackle the intricacies of domestic violence. So overall there is way too many brilliant thriller writers out there for me to return to another Alex Lake novel, but at least Killing Kate did one good thing for me it made my love for Big Little Lies even stronger."}, {"userName": "Laura von Eden", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51197670-laura-von-eden", "userReview": "Kate hat sich nach vielen Jahren von ihrem Jugendfreund Phil getrennt und genie\u00dft nun das Leben. Jedenfalls m\u00f6chte sie das gerne tun, aber in ihrem beschaulichen Wohnort geht ein Serienm\u00f6rder um. Dieser ermordet mit Vorliebe junge Frauen, die Kate erschreckend \u00e4hnlich sehen. Ihr Exfreund scheint au\u00dferdem nicht sehr gut mit der Trennung klar zu kommen. Gibt es da vielleicht eine Verbindung?Bereits zu Beginn des Buches wird jedoch noch eine weitere Storyline angedeutet. Kate geh\u00f6rte mit 3 weiteren Freundinnen zu den sogenannten \u201aFab Four\u2018. Doch eine der Freundinnen, Beth, scheint nicht mehr zur Clique zu geh\u00f6ren und man bekommt das Gef\u00fchl, dass Beth irgendetwas passiert sein muss. Warum Beth nicht mehr zur Clique geh\u00f6rt, erf\u00e4hrt man jedoch erst sehr viel sp\u00e4ter, da sich das Buch zun\u00e4chst mit Kate besch\u00e4ftigt.Kate wird als eine sehr sympathische und auch liebenswerte Person, mit Ecken und Kanten dargestellt. Man kann sich gut in sie hineinversetzen, nur manche Aktionen von ihr fand ich etwas dr\u00fcber. Man kann verstehen, dass Kate sich angesichts der Tatsache, dass alle Opfer ihr sehr \u00e4hnlich sind, sehr f\u00fcrchtet. Gl\u00fccklicherweise wurde sie aber nicht als paranoide Jungfer in Not dargestellt, sondern eher recht besonnen.Der Thriller war insgesamt wirklich sehr spannend, da stets neue Dinge passierten, so dass man merklich das Gef\u00fchl hatte, dass sich die Situation zuspitzt. Einen gro\u00dfen Minuspunkt gibt es jedoch f\u00fcr mich \u2013 die Vorhersagbarkeit.Vielleicht mag es daran liegen, dass ich einfach schon sehr viele Thriller gelesen habe, aber im Prinzip hatte ich schnell einen Verdacht, wer hinter all den Vorf\u00e4llen steckt, wenngleich der Beweggrund dahinter doch nochmal eine \u00dcberraschung war. Trotzdem gab es einfach so viele Hinweise auf den/die T\u00e4ter*in, dass es eigentlich schon wieder zum Schmunzeln war. Hat der Autor wirklich so plumpe Hinweise eingebaut? Einzeln betrachtet, mag man da vielleicht noch nicht auf die Aufl\u00f6sung kommen, aber insgesamt hat es schon ein sehr eindeutiges Bild ergeben.Ich kann nicht mal genau benennen, warum mir dieses Buch trotzdem unglaublich gut gefallen hat, vermutlich lag es am tollen Schreibstil des Autoren und dass trotzdem immer wieder versucht wurde, andere Personen zu verd\u00e4chtigen. Es wurde einfach nicht langweilig und selbst nach der Aufl\u00f6sung folgten noch \u00fcber 100 Seiten voller Spannung.Insgesamt hat mir das Buch wirklich gut gefallen, auch wenn sich mein schneller Verdacht zum Ende hin best\u00e4tigt hat. Wer hier genauso schnell den/die T\u00e4ter*in err\u00e4t, ist vielleicht trotzdem vom gro\u00dfen \u201aWarum\u2018 \u00fcberrascht, denn darauf w\u00e4re ich auch nie gekommen."}, {"userName": "Joanne Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25524955-joanne-robertson", "userReview": "It was a nice surprise to see this for sale on Amazon although after all the hype that surrounded After Anna when it was released, Killing Kate has rather crept in the back door without much of a fanfare! I thought that After Anna was a decent enough read so after reading a sample chapter of Killing Kate I downloaded the rest and settled down to read.The thing that attracted me most from the sample was the fact it was set locally to me, around the Warrington area and I'm always a sucker for a Cheshire based book especially a psychological thriller. But beyond that, I really loved the idea that a killer was going around killing women who looked exactly like Kate, even though I had to suspend belief that they all coincidentally lived in or around the same village as her. There is obviously a back story surrounding the group of three friends, which once included a fourth, and the book starts with them on holiday in Turkey where Kate meets Mike, also coincidentally from the same area. And at home brooding about their recent break up, Kate's long term boyfriend Phil is trying to get back on the dating scene whilst battling an addiction to stalking his ex. All great so far! I have to admit that, like before in After Anna, i did work out what was going on pretty early in the book. But because I was aware that this would probably be the case I was able to just relax and enjoy the ride, especially the last quarter of the book where things do get rather dramatic and exciting, if a little bit far fetched at times. This is a book that you will probably want to devour in one sitting, rather like I did. It's a fun and easy to read grip-lit full of unlikable characters which seems to be a bit of a theme for Alex Lake. And it was nice to be able to picture the settings as I went along, Jodrell Bank being a particular favourite, alongside the good old M6 bridge The Thelwall Viaduct.Worth a look especially if you really enjoyed After Anna and I have to say that for me personally, Killing Kate does have the slight edge."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1119019-karen", "userReview": "Kate Armstrong has just broken up with her long-time boyfriend Phil and, together with a couple of friends, goes away on a short break to Turkey. Her ex is not taking the split well and develops obsessive stalking tendencies, in the misguided idea that Kate will reconsider and they can get back together.In the meantime, Kate realises that she has the freedom to enjoy her new single status and takes full advantage; that is, until she returns home and discovers that women who look just like her are being murdered.Killing Kate is just the type of book I enjoy \u2013 it\u2019s an extremely well written, fast paced, serial killer thriller and okay, it wasn\u2019t difficult to work out quite early on who the killer was but this didn\u2019t spoil my enjoyment at all and I just immersed myself in the story. I may have worked out the \u2018who\u2019 but certainly not the \u2018why\u2019 and this was where the story became more intense and twisted.The main characters were very well developed and realistic. Part of me despised Phil for being so full of self pity and for virtually begging Kate to take him back \u2013 I wanted to shout at him to man up but at the same time, I couldn\u2019t help but feel sympathy for him. They had been together for over 10 years and now suddenly his life had completely changed \u2013 he\u2019d lost his home and his lover and was reduced to relying on a friend\u2019s generosity for somewhere to live. Likewise I had a lot of time for Kate \u2013 she was sensible and goodhearted but despite this she made some rather dubious choices which you could just see would come back and bite her. Everyone has a back story and in this case, the separate strands between the present and five years earlier tie up very well to form a dramatic conclusion.The dialogue, the descriptive writing, the short chapters \u2013 these all hooked me in straight away and even if the story did become perhaps a little incredulous towards the end, it was one of those reads that I didn\u2019t want to put down. Definitely recommended if you like a twisty, tension filled story.The name \u2018Alex Lake\u2019 is a pseudonym of a British novelist and this is the second book published under that name. I do have the author\u2019s previous thriller (After Anna) on my shelf to read which I bought ages ago and haven\u2019t got round to and after reading this I\u2019m hoping to bump it up the TBR mountain. I am also very intrigued to know who the author really is \u2013 if anyone knows, please tell!"}, {"userName": "Sam (Clues and Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20224869-sam-clues-and-reviews", "userReview": "Kate returns from a post break-up holiday with her closest friends as news of a serial killer, dubbed the Stockton Heath Strangler, hits in her hometown; all the victims look like Kate. Reeling from his breakup with Kate, Phil is drinking more and blacking out and once he is questioned in the connection to the murders, Kate wonders if the man she had spent ten years of her life with could be a killer.Killing Kate by Alex Lake is a serial killer thriller following Kate Armstrong was my first experience with a work by this author; I\u2019ll have to admit, it was a fairly addicting read. I was able to read this one easily over the course of a few hours. Filled with red herrings, a mix of past and present events, along with a plethora of complex characters, this one had me wanting more.The novel opens with Kate, fresh from her breakup with Phil, returning from a trip with her friends. Once she arrives home, she cannot escape the news of a serial killer who has been running rampant and strangling his victims throughout her neighborhood. The victims all look like Kate. As the killer claims for victims, Kate becomes increasingly more paranoid as she feels she is being followed. Her ex-boyfriend quickly becomes a suspect and Kate turns to her new boyfriend for comfort. As she searches for the truth, she stumbles upon something much more sinister.Lake fills the plot with red herrings and has the reader consistently asking questions. The story is told through the perspectives of Kate and Phil, the reader is forced to question, which narrator is reliable and who should be trusted. The \u201cKate\u201d narration further ventures into the past as we delve into the discussion of her friend Beth and how her group of four became a trio. I was left wondering (and puzzled) to how this was all related. Once I realized, I was impressed with Lake\u2019s ability to weave it all together.Although I did find the plot \u201ctwist\u201d to be quite predictable, I did enjoy the end of the novel and found the story enjoyable long after the killer\u2019s identity is revealed. I would recommend this novel for anyone who likes a fast paced thriller and wants to \u201csit back and enjoy the ride\u201d. This one releases January 31, 2017.

I do love a good serial killer thriller and thats kind of what you get here with an added mystery back story and a clever engaging plot.So women are being murdered - they all look somewhat like Kate. Kate meanwhile is going through a divisive break up and with this on top its a worrying time. Alex Lake weaves a fast moving and highly readable story here surrounding Kate's past and her present issues. We also hear from her ex who is not coping with the break up well at all - but could he be dangerous? And what did happen when four friends became three?The author teases things out nicely, I love the writing too it just gets right to the heart of the characters and keeps the reader guessing, if you like crime and thrillers its bang on target.

In between the direly predictable plot, and the narcissistic irritant of a main character, there was not much left to enjoy. I found myself willing the killer to catch up with Killing Kate (pun absolutely intended) just so I could stop wanting to do it myself. I could write page after page about why Kate is a nuisance, but I will spare anyone who is reading that misery. I have a sneaking suspicion that the big reveal was meant to be a \"gotcha!\" moment, but it was akin to a game of hide and seek, where you can see the person's feet sticking out from under the curtains, but have to keep up the lame pretence of not knowing where they are for the sake of the game.

I feel a bit lackluster about writing this review because, frankly, the book was lackluster. So this may just be a very short review.The overall idea is fantastic. I mean, of course it is, I wouldn't have picked up the book and read it if the synopsis and overall idea wasn't intriguing. A women notice's that a recent serial killer's victims all resemble her. That suspenseful beginning could go in a number of different and thrilling directions and I wanted to find out which it was......Unfortunately, it didn't go far.There was no real mystery. Everything was predictable and just when you were hoping that the author would prove you wrong and show you how she was making it look predictable in an effort to blindside you with a thrilling surprise and turn everything on it's head, well...you were just greeted with everything you had already surmised.Beyond the plot, the writing was a tad dull and slow. I didn't feel driven to finish this book, unless you count just wanting to be done because i was bored. The characters weren't intriguing enough or particularly likeable. In these types of books you expect a level of naivete in the lead character but you don't want them to be outright stupid... and Kate was bordering on stupid.

Even though the pace was actually pretty slow, the short chapters kept the suspense up and made it so much easier to say \"just one more chapter\" long after I should've stopped reading. As for the story itself...it was ok. It was kind of a different angle of a serial killer book and I liked that. Kate was not a very likable character. I preferred the chapters from her ex-boyfriend's POV, Phil. A little over half way through I guessed who the serial killer was and what the slight \"twist\" with it was.

I find that his mysteries are too easy to figure out, and there is no suspense in his psychological thrillers. I may be in the minority regarding this book as it has a 3.9 rating on Goodreads.

Das war die erste Frage, die ich mir schon nach der ersten Seite gestellt habe.Gleich darauf lernt man Kate kennen, die sich von ihrem langj\u00e4hrigen Freund Phil getrennt hat und nun ihr Leben genie\u00dfen will. Also fliegt sie erst einmal in Urlaub, allerdings wird sie dort schon mit der Mordserie in ihrer Heimatstadt konfrontiert, die sich auch nachdem sie wieder zu Hause ist, weiterzieht.\u00a0Das Buch war durchgehend wirklich sowas von spannend, das aufh\u00f6ren zu lesen ein Ding der Unm\u00f6glichkeit war! Wirklich JEDER war hier verd\u00e4chtig, viele falsche Spuren und und Ungereimtheiten sorgen daf\u00fcr, das man hier null Plan hat wer der Serienm\u00f6rder sein k\u00f6nnte, weil es einfach auf jeden gepasst hat. Ich hatte immer wieder mal einen anderen Verd\u00e4chtigen und war absolut ratlos.Das Leben von Kate wurde sehr gut und bildlich beschrieben, ich fand Kate war ein sehr, sehr starker, tougher Charakter und ich habe es geliebt \u00fcber sie zu lesen. Die Angst, die sie beherrscht, war zum greifen nahe. Selbst ich hatte beim lesen so oft Angst und eine G\u00e4nsehaut, die ganze d\u00fcstere Atmosph\u00e4re hatte mich v\u00f6llig im Griff. Ich an ihrer Stelle w\u00e4re schon l\u00e4ngst durchgedreht, aber gut, da war Kate auch mehrere kurz davor und an Schockmomenten wurde hier auch nicht gespartAuch die restlichen Protagonisten waren durchweg einfach nur interessant. Vor allem Phil war mir mehr als oft ein R\u00e4tsel, weil ich mir einfach nicht erkl\u00e4ren konnte, ob er nun etwas zu verbergen hat oder nicht, denn eigentlich ist er ja ein sehr liebenswerter Mensch? Bis man dann als Leser endlich erf\u00e4hrt, wer der T\u00e4ter ist und die Frage um das unglaubliche \"Warum\" gel\u00fcftet wird, passiert noch einiges, was ich nicht erwartet h\u00e4tte und war mehr als einmal absolut \u00fcberrascht. Selbst am Ende, als man dann wei\u00df wie alles zusammenh\u00e4ngt und denkt, das Buch ist nun abgeschlossen, passiert nochmal etwas so unerwartetes....das h\u00e4tte ich nie f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich gehalten und war eine v\u00f6llig unerwartete Wendung. Ich war restlos begeistert von dem Buch, welches \u00fcbrigens ohne Fragen abgeschlossen ist, und kann es einfach nur empfehlen!"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9481759-laura", "userReview": "I really hate to give a bad review but I didn\u2019t like this at all. I didn\u2019t mind so much that I figured out who the killer was right off the bat, I mean it was pretty obvious, but that doesn\u2019t always matter as long as I can still enjoy the story as it unfolds. This however, there just really wasn\u2019t anything compelling about it. The villain and the related twist was hokey and unbelievable. The characters were boring and hard to relate to. Kate was just dumb, constantly giving out too much information to people she barely knew. In any other situation this might have helped the plot along but this girl already knew there was a killer out there who was most likely targeting her. Idiot. It makes no sense that she would run her mouth like that. And what about her stupid friend Gemma who thought it would be a good idea to set up an online dating profile in the middle of all this madness? Yeah! Let\u2019s do it. Great idea. The worst part about this entire book was the constant over-explaining. It was so insulting to the reader. And not only did it happen between the killer and Kate but then again, in great detail between the killer and another character. And there were lots of other instances of it all throughout. I thought the whole captivity scene was idiotic. Especially the part about the broken teeth. I think it would take a significantly longer amount of time to break one\u2019s teeth while chewing leather than what was shown in this book and that\u2019s if it\u2019s even possible to begin with. I mean it\u2019s leather. It can stretch. It\u2019s pliable. Unless her teeth were already brittle and bad to begin with, I just don\u2019t see it happening, not in the amount of time that it did anyway."}, {"userName": "Chandra Claypool (wherethereadergrows)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9722719-chandra-claypool-wherethereadergrows", "userReview": "Kate goes on holiday to Turkey with her best girlfriends as a get away after a rough break up with her boyfriend, Phil, who she had been with for 10 years. Upon her return, she learns of a killer in her hometown. After the second and then third murder, it becomes clear that the girls look eerily like her. Phil is acting erratically as he is not taking the break up well at all. His obsession with her and the fact that one of the girls he \"dated\" after her was one that was murdered does not bode well for him trying to prove his innocence. Are these just coincidences, or is something more happening? Past secrets come to play and now she is in a race to save not only herself but the people closest to her.This was a very fast and fun read. I felt the plot twists were easy to see coming and my guesses were proven quite quickly. I did like the author's writing style in the fact that every time I had a question, it's like she read my mind and addressed it within the next few pages. Recommend for anyone wanting a page-turner of a one sit read."}], "description": "A serial killer is stalking your home town.He has a type: all his victims look the same.And they all look like you.Kate returns from a post break-up holiday with her girlfriends to news of a serial killer in her home town \u2013 and his victims all look like her.It could, of course, be a simple coincidence.Or maybe not.She becomes convinced she is being watched, followed even.
