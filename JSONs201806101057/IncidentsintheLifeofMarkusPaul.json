It was his first day on the job; his pay was to be used for his medical studies so that he could become a doctor and return to his reserve. Accident or murder? Who is to blame, if anybody? This query weaves through the narrative and turns out to have more components than anybody wants to deal with, then or later, whether the police, the First Nation Band Council or the members of the community. While some reserve residents instantly designate a culprit, a white man and neighbour, others like the Band Chief, Amos Paul, or the police investigation attempt to establish the evidence before coming to conclusions. Both sides attract support for their position; the media gets involved too... in fact, the tragic incident opens up something between a can of worms and a Pandora's Box where old enmities, power struggles, control over land and fishing rights come to the fore, integrity and loyalties are challenged and the search for truth is anything but straight forward. David Adams Richards, award winning Canadian author of many books, has created a complex and totally absorbing tale of a troubled community at the crossroad, peopled with believable and memorable characters, depicted sympathetically in all their innocent or flawed individualities. Richards's intimate familiarity with the region - the Miramichie in northern New Brunswick - adds great authenticity and richness to the novel.Seen to a large extent through the eyes of Markus Paul, a fifteen-year old at the time of the events and the Chief's grandson, Richards weaves the narrative between different time lines, from 1985 to 2006. Markus cannot put the drama of that summer and the months that followed out of his mind... there remain aspects he still needs to grapple with more than twenty years later \"...it's not the trap that kills the beaver, but the drowning that follows\". What has been missing from the evidence? Each time his mind returns to the 1985 events and the major players, another aspect is revealed or clarified, another clue discovered and placed into a broader context, other participants or witnesses given a voice to explain their position or action at the time. For me the story turns into a deeply affecting, multi-layered jigsaw puzzle that takes the reader into the heart of one community, its people, their lives and challenges that have their roots in the past and continue into the present. Many of the issues and concerns are, of course, not unique to one place and time. In different constellations they occur elsewhere in Canada and beyond.First published on amazon.com"}, {"userName": "Shirley Schwartz", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278399-shirley-schwartz", "userReview": "Stark, stunning and profound. I really don't know what to say about this book. It came to me highly recommended by numerous people because they know I am a big fan of Canadian literature. I know that David Adams Richards is a wonderful novelist. His stories are stark and bleak, and they don't always have happy endings. His books are difficult to read because they are filled with sadness and hopelessness and this one is no different. Even the ending in this book seems to return full circle to that terrible summer of 1985 along the Mirimichi River. The story goes back and forth seamlessly from summer and fall of 1985 to the year 2007 as we follow the life of Markus Paul. In 1985 Markus is only 15 years old. His mother and father are dead and he lives with his wise old grandfather Amos Paul who happens to the chief of the Micmac reserve they live on. This story is about guilt and lies, but it is also about the giant chasm between the native Canadians and their white neighbours. This is certainly not a new story, but it is one that hasn't changed much over one hundred years. A young 17 year old Micmac boy is killed in a workplace accident while he was unloading pulp on a vessel. The hold he was working on held five people, including himself-3 white males, 1 small child and Hector Penniac. Somehow Hector ends up dead and the repercussions of his death rock the First Nations reserve as well as their close white neighbours. Lives are changed forever with this terrible tragedy and it takes 21 years and the perseverance of Marcus Paul, now a decorated RCMP officer, to finally solve the puzzle of what happened on board the Lutheran. By that time 2 people had lost their lives as a result of the incident, and Amos Paul, Markus' grandfather has died. It was Amos that knew that something wasn't right about the 4th hold. He held onto that idea until he died even though it caused him to lose his position as chief and also it caused the people on his reserve to turn away from him. Amos was too meek and mild to get his point across, and instead it was left to the bullies and misguided young men on the Reserve to take action. That is what caused all the death, distrust and damage. The wrong solution to the crime won out over the right one because the men who propounded their solution were loud and made sure that their point was the one that was put forth. It forever changed lives of many people that were touched by the tragedy and resulted in hopelessness and despair to those left on the reserve. Markus' determination to solve the crime finally bears fruit, and the truth will help his community to heal. That is the happy ending that we get in this book. The happy ending doesn't come to Markus Paul. We see so clearly how small actions and the resulting cover-up can send shock waves through a community. We learn that \"it's not the trap that kills the beaver, but the drowning that follows.\""}, {"userName": "Doreen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8083149-doreen", "userReview": "On a Mi'Kmaq reserve on the Miramichi, in 1985, seventeen-year-old Hector Penniac is killed while helping load pulpwood into the hull of a ship. Although there is no physical evidence indicating his guilt, blame soon falls on Roger Savage, a white man who lives on the border of the reserve. Amos Paul, the 75-year-old chief, fears that Savage is being scapegoated by being seen as the incarnation of centuries of wrongs committed by whites. The chief, the voice of reason, strives for truth and peace, but many of the younger people view Amos' conciliatory approach as obsolete and favour a more confrontational style which demands immediate retribution. They attempt to remove Savage from his home; the crisis gathers force, and tragedy ensues. Twenty years later, the chief's grandson, Markus Paul, who is an RCMP officer, sets out to unravel the mystery of Hector's death and to answer some questions surrounding subsequent events on the reserve. On the one hand, therefore, the book can be read as a mystery, but it is much, much more than that.The author scours the community and examines the motives of everyone affected by Hector's death. No one escapes unscathed. Corruption and weakness are exposed everywhere. Markus observes, \"Yes . . . we all have one [cheatin' heart]\" (267).One theme is people's \"willingness to forego a certain integrity in order to belong to a group\" (49). Chief Amos, the moral centre of the novel, explains people's behaviour with an analogy: \"'There is always a big hidden giant in the room, and this giant attaches itself to people in a crowd, and moves them in one direction or another. Those who do not join this giant are outcast, and sometimes will get stepped on by great big feet. Those who join the giant have the benefit of puffing themselves up and acting like one, and sometimes do the stepping - until their friends leave and then they just get smaller and smaller. And sometimes after it is all over, they simply disappear'\" (105). These words prove to be prophetic: many people, including the journalist Max Doran who covers the crisis, fall prey to this giant.The author examines the lingering consequences of Canada's mistreatment of aboriginal people, and there is no doubt of his sympathy for First Nations people. However, he bravely suggests, as Rayyan Al-Shawaf summarized in The Globe and Mail, that \"Legitimate historical grievances cannot justify the pernicious notion of inherited guilt. . . . attempting to redress sins of the past sometimes leads to victimizing innocent descendants of the sinners.\" This is a book that all Canadians, both indigenous and non-indigenous, should read.Please check out my reader's blog: http://schatjesshelves.blogspot.ca/"}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl", "userReview": "Best one yet from David Adams Richards. He continues to refine his talent for showing how truth is relative, and how our words and actions so often ripple in unintended ways. The only thing that seems certain is the opening line of the book: \"The day Hector Penniac died in the fourth hold of the cargo ship Lutheran, he woke up at 6:20 in the morning.\" Was it an accident or was he murdered? Who knows, and who will say? So much is said and done thoughtlessly. Integrity and morals are constantly shifting and re-adjusting to circumstances and expectations. The book describes a cascade of untruths and truth, indistinguishable from each other. It is a rich and complex novel, examining politics, racism in both First Nations and whites, poverty, and the nature of the human condition. Classic Richards themes, at his best. Highly recommended.

It brought up a number of different conflicts that really made you think. I was pleased that it dealt with Native and White antagonisms in a way that blamed neither side as the sole evil, but gave shared blame to everything that was happening in the novel. I also liked that it was recognized that the only way either side can heal from the evil that was done in the past is by moving forward and not clinging on to those horrific actions.The book went on a lot longer than I think it needed to. It jumped back and forth between other perspectives to show just how every individual character was responding and thinking about the incident and it just took so long to get to the climax that it became a drag near the end. The ending was so flat and disappointing that when I was thinking I could actually enjoy the book the end made me close it and decide it really wasn't that great. Despite so many things being solved, even in bittersweet ways, the way it dealt with Sky and Markus' relationship was the most lazy and terrible way to conclude anything, let alone a novel. I was extremely disappointed and just kind of upset with Richards for thinking this was suitable ending. It gave me the impression he was coming to the realization his book was too long and just stopped writing there. I wouldn't read this book again."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4987113-lori", "userReview": "Wow. Wow. Words escape me in trying to capture my thoughts and feelings about this haunting, multi-layered and important novel. David Adams Richards is a fantastic storyteller. His books, as bleak as the outcomes generally are, paint an important picture of Canadian life that all of us from this country should contemplate. The mysterious death of a First Nations youth unleashes catastrophic events in a Micmac community. Deep seeded prejudices, hatred and feelings of \"being wronged\" are unearthed and no one in this story escapes unscathed. All are permanently affected and irrevocably altered from the events that took place that summer in 1985. The main protagonist, Markus Paul, who was 15 at the time and now, in 2006, a decorated RCMP officer, still cannot get past what happened that summer 21 years ago and, after ruining relationship after relationship in his life, commits to finally getting to the bottom of what happened back then that began with the death of 17 year-old Hector Penniac in the hold of a Scandinavian cargo ship. Moving seamlessly between 2006 and 1985, this story slowly and deliciously unfolds. We meet the wise but slow to act Chief, Amos Paul (Markus' grandfather), the dynamic and politically driven Chief-in-Waiting, Isaac Snow, the hothead Joel Ginnish, Max Doran, the eager but suggestible journalist and the wronged and unfairly condemned white man in this, Roger Savage. As the layers unfold in this story, we begin to see deep into the motivations of all characters and how each of them \"cheat\" the truth in some way either by inaction or overtly lying and acting for selfish or twisted reasons. Throughout this journey, the reader learns to appreciate the quiet strength and good heart of Amos although angered by his inaction at critical times. Comparing Amos' quiet, shy leadership with the more charismatic Isaac Snow's one can't help but reflect on leadership in general and how important a mix of charisma and confidence with wisdom and caution is in leading communities through crisis. Markus's final actions in the book bring all of us full circle with someone who finally takes the steps necessary to allow this community to heal. He offered comfort where required like with the ill George Morrissey in the hospital, strength in action as is so desperately needed in his investigations and finally leadership to understand what is needed for healing is for the true story to be told and bringing together the two very people required in order to tell it. An amazing and thought-provoking book. Important. Every Canadian should read it."}, {"userName": "Shonna Froebel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14633278-shonna-froebel", "userReview": "Wow, can Richards ever write. This book moves back and forth between events in 1985 and 2006/7. In 1985 Markus Paul was a young man, living with his grandfather on the reserve. His grandfather Amos Paul was chief and Markus Paul was in love with a young woman Sky who lived nearby with her grandmother and younger brother, Little Joe.When a young native man, Hector, is killed in what seems at first to be an accident his first day on the job loading ships rumours start, and soon fingers at pointed at another young white man, Roger Savage, who was waiting for a chance to work that day. This novel follows the search for what really happened to Hector, and what a number of people do as a result of his death. One of these is Amos, a careful man with a good heart. Another is Isaac, a middle-aged man who seemed destined to be chief one day. Another is Joel, Hector's older brother, who has often been in trouble with the law before. And we also have Roger himself, and a young reporter Max Doran, who is excited about the assignment to cover this story, but not experienced enough to see the pitfalls.This is a book about how small actions have great outcomes, and these actions are laid out one by one before us, gradually revealing the truth and the politics, prejudice and beliefs that led to each action.Years later Markus Paul is an RCMP officer still searching for the truth about what happened back in 1985, still haunted by it. When he finally discovers the truth, it is surprising and yet one can see how it all seemed inevitable. Richards is an author that seems to see into characters and show the complexities of them. A novel that will haunt you."}, {"userName": "Geraldine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9679982-geraldine", "userReview": "David Adams Richards...one of my favorite authors...does not disappoint.

(These complaints would come more frequently over the summer.) They came to the paper by way of scant letters to the editor, letters saying nothing had been proven. At times there was also a halting statement from one of the youngest reporters, Gordon Young, who had lived long in that forbidding area near the reserve, and who did not trust Isaac Snow or Joel Ginnish, for as he said, Isaac Snow was a born politician and Joel Ginnish was a born thief, and he knew them both, better than Mr. Doran ever would. And he said this without the least worry that those who measured themselves by conventional wisdom would think his statements insensitive. Why he did not care what in hell people thought, him with his soft hand and his Hush Puppies, no one knew - but perhaps, some reflected in a pejorative way, he was a throwback to another time, whe discrimination against the First Nations was openly accepted. Or, perhaps, in a real way he cared very much for the reserve and could not allow an untrue sentiment to pass as true, even if others thought it true.\"After all they have been through,\" Max said to Gordon Young one Tuesday afternoon when the argument began again in the office, \"and you are questioning my few reports?\"Everyone laughed nervously at the old-fashioned, deeply conveservative young journalist Gordon, who was in many ways an outcast among them. And Gordon Young, who had come from a place even more remote than the reserve, wore silly clothes, and had been foolish enough, or perhaps not, to believe in integrity above anything else, even above irony, said that this is not what hew was questioning. \"No sir, Mr. Doran\" (for he always called Max \"Mr. Doran\") \"I am not questioning the suffering of the first peoples. I have First Nations nieces and nephews, and will not question that. No, I am questioning others using this suffering to exploit a story, and go in a wrong direction because of it.\" He mentioned the crane, the stevedores and other details from that day Hector Penniac died. And he decired in the most gentle way he could the idea of some people using an uneducated and solitary man like Roger Savage to satiate the already insatiable dislike of that kind of man, a dislike that many, many academics and some students applauding Mr. Doran seemed to feel - people who were writing to the paper with their \"unending\" support of the band. Max looked at Gordon Young for a bit, and wondered about him a little. Then he replied, with the same bemusement he had felt with Amos Paul, \"Ah, I know all of that, Gordon. All of it. Ive paid my dues, lad. Ive been on twenty stories like this. And I have come to this conclusion painfully. These guys are always the first to cry foul. And I do not want to blame. No, I don't.

Four he arrives late and is surpised that his senoirity has been rebuffed. Five, he is angry and starts to drink.

It starts with a tragedy (murder or accident) when a young native man is killed when a load of lumber falls which is being loaded onto a pulp boat. Blame is placed on an impoverished young white man living on the border of the reservation who has been in dispute with the community over fishing rights. The story deals with big themes: lies, and half-lies, sins of commission and sins of omission, justice misplaced, justice denied, whether redemption is possible and if the sins of the past can ever be resolved in the present. Lies are told due to fear, ambition, greed, bribery and simply because a person believes incorrectly what happened and decides it is the truth.The story reveals prejudice by whites against the natives, but also prejudice of the intellectual elite against the uneducated and poor, whom they presume to be right wing bigots. Into the community comes an ambitious young reporter whose stories are in the news all over Canada, and he has escalated the the turmoil in his writings. He firmly believes in the guilt of the accused. Later he refuses to write any more articles as he begins to doubt. As a result he loses his life's work. Observing all this is the old chief's grandson, Markus. The old chief firmly believes the person blamed for the first tragedy is innocent but cannot prove it, and is losing any authority in the community as a result. Markus is blamed by the girl he loves for taking her little brother to watch events in aftermath of tragedy, and the young boy is killed. Again blame is placed on the man who was felt to be guilty of the first death, and he is killed either by accident or intention.  The story then moves to 2006, when Markus is an RCMP officer and has been haunted by the events of 1985. He promised his grandfather he would try to find out what really happened in all three deaths.

At least this one had a bit of a story but I found it very difficult to follow the story with the constant jumping back and forth between 1985 and 2006 and the middle half of the book bogged down and became rather slow, boring, dragged out and repetitive. I've been trying to read mysteries by Canadian Authors and, since reading another reader's review of Vicki Delaney's \"Gold Digger\" I, too, decided to try to read books set in every region of Canada. There are a few regions in which it is very difficult to find a mystery set in that region and that is available in some format in Canada. New Brunswick is one of them!

The effect is like watching Prospero play with people on his island if you're in a generous mood, or like watching a puppet play and being very much aware of the woodenness of the marionettes and the strings pulling them about if you're not.

Hector Penniac had been planning to go to university, perhaps to study medicine. Roger Savage, a loner who has had to make his own way since his youth, comes under suspicion of killing Hector over a union card and a morning\u2019s work. Even if he can\u2019t quite put it into words, Roger immediately sees the ways in which Hector\u2019s death will be viewed as symbolic, as more than an isolated tragedy\u2014and that he is caught in a chain of events that will become more explosive with each passing day. \u00a0The aging chief of Hector\u2019s band, Amos Paul, tries to reduce the tensions raised by the investigation into Hector\u2019s death and its connection to a host of other simmering issues, from territorial lines to fishing rights. His approach leads him into conflict with Isaac Snow, a younger and more dynamic man whom many in the band would prefer to lead them\u2014especially when the case attracts press attention in the form of an ambitious journalist named Max Doran, the first of many outsiders to bring his own agenda and motives onto the Micmac reserve. Joel Ginnish, Isaac\u2019s volatile and sometimes violent friend, decides to bring justice to Roger Savage when the authorities refuse to, blockading the reserve in order to do so. And though perhaps no one really means for it to happen, soon a single incident grows ineluctably into a crisis that engulfs a whole society, a whole province and in some ways a whole country. \u00a0Twenty years later, RCMP officer Markus Paul\u2014Chief Amos Paul\u2019s grandson, who was fifteen years old when Hector was killed\u2014tries to piece together the clues surrounding Hector Penniac\u2019s death. The decades have passed, and much about the case has been twisted beyond recognition by the many ways that different people have sought to exploit it. But, haunted by the past, Markus still struggles towards a truth that will snap \u201cthose chains that had once seemed impossible to break.\u201d (290)\u00a0This is a novel that begins with an instant from today\u2019s headlines, and digs down into the marrow to explore the oldest themes we know: murder and betrayal, race and history, the brutal and chaotic forces that guide the groups we are drawn into. Nothing is one-sided in David Adams Richards\u2019 world\u2014even the most scheming characters have moments of grace, while the most benevolent are shown to have selfish motives, or the need to show off their goodness. All are depicted with an almost Biblical gravity, framed by an understated genius of storytelling that makes this novel at once both an utterly gripping mystery, and a vitally important document of Canada\u2019s broken past and divided present.", "title": "Incidents in the Life of Markus Paul", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10086652-incidents-in-the-life-of-markus-paul", "average": 4.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320444270l/10086652.jpg", "reviews": 41, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/87458.David_Adams_Richards", "name": "David Adams Richards"}], "type": ["Cultural", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10086652-incidents-in-the-life-of-markus-paul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13135984-incidents-in-the-life-of-markus-paul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15958576-incidents-in-the-life-of-markus-paul-david-adams-richards", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16126298-incidents-in-the-life-of-markus-paul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/151381.Mercy_Among_the_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110344.Nights_Below_Station_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110346.The_Friends_of_Meager_Fortune", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110347.River_of_the_Brokenhearted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425484.The_Bay_of_Love_and_Sorrows"]}
