First, It's a coming-of-age/loss-of-innocence story, wherein three 15-year-old friends take the ashes of their recently dead fourth friend on a journey they all need. Second, it's a book that reminds you that no matter what happens on a road trip, road trips are always worth it. Third, it's sickly funny.Before I go on, I need to say I won this book in the goodreads 'giveaways' program.So, yeah, these three mates (that's British for 'friends') take their mate's (friend's) ashes. Take them. Out of the dead guy's sister's hands. Because they're angry that the funeral was just what a bunch of people who didn't care particularly for their friend made it. And they book for Scotland. They figure what they're doing is illegal, but don't quite know what crime it is. Things don't go smoothly, of course - otherwise you wouldn't have a book, would you? - and they find themselves off course, without money, hungry, and more interested in the girls on the train than the coming storm and their shelterless evening awaiting.Some of what you know is going to happen toward the end happens, but it has to happen, because some of it was pretty much inevitable. That's not the point, though, is it? It's the journey, after all.Road trips are always worth it.By the way, I'm a modern, enlightened dad, and want to make sure everybody's kids but my own are exposed to the most vile stuff imaginable, but be aware that the language in this book is like real fifteen year old boys talk, when adults aren't around. There's plenty of sex slang and meaningless curse words throughout. It's YA, but definitely for the older members of that demographic."}, {"userName": "Raya", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4535448-raya", "userReview": "\"Ross was hit by a car, knocked off his bike. At the funeral the vicar had called it an accident. But somehow the word wasn't enough. It wasn't big enough, powerful enough--didn't mean enough. He hadn't spilled a cup of tea, he hadn't tripped over his own feet. He'd had his life smashed out of him. It felt like there should be a whole new word invented just to describe it.\"Upset over the loss of their best friend, Ross, and displeased by his funeral, Blake, Sim, and Kenny all agree: their dead mate deserves a proper ceremony. The funeral \"felt like genuine betrayal,\" says Blake, because Ross means more to them than hoaxed compassion expressed by people who didn't care about him--not like Blake, Sim, or Kenny did, anyway. Ross was their friend and worthy of something authentic. Born in a moment of grief, hurt, and eagerness to do one last thing for their friend, the boys plan to take Ross to Ross--Ross, Scotland, that is.\"It's not really kidnapping, is it?\" Kenny said. \"He'd have to be alive, wouldn't he? For it to be a proper kidnapping, I mean.\"What is supposed to be a two-day scheme stretches out to be a longer adventure as lost money, forgotten train tickets, and evading police jeopardize the mission. The biggest threat, however, lies with each other. Together, Ross, Kenny, and Sim all see themselves as the only three people who never wronged or abandoned Ross--not like his sister Caroline (who'd publicly embarrassed him), his ex-girlfriend Nina, the bully Sean Munro, or even Ross' parents. They easily dismiss the idea that Ross intentionally biked into the oncoming vehicle, but their sureness and friendship are tested as they each question their loyalty. This trip will become a bookmarked chapter in their lives they can\u2019t forget. Expected to fortify their friendship, their willingness (or lack thereof) to speak honestly\u2013to listen and understand\u2013quietly lingers in the background. Difficult to ignore yet subtle, it hovers between the text, and I could sense its claws intimidating to tear an already weakened bond.Our friendship used to be a solid square, one of us to each other. Things were very different as a triangle.Ross is what they all gravitated toward in the beginning, and it was Ross who bound the four of them together. Now that Ross is dead, the remaining three will either strengthen their connection or watch it unravel. Coming-of-age stories, by their nature, are stories most people relate to. They often capture those moments when the simple ignorance of childhood or youthful innocence begins to fray. For me, personally, I enjoy the dynamics of male friendships much more than the bond girls share. Perhaps it's because I find societal gender roles versus natural male and female relationships interesting, but boys often have a hinted intimacy sitting underneath all that masculinity. It's an affection that is, naturally, very different from girls. Once these little moments in the story are pieced together and viewed as a whole, it can strike powerfully as touching and meaningful. Oddly, however, I am apathetic toward Ostrich Boys. Some kind of emotion usually rouses the instant I finish reading a book's last sentence. Whether I feel happy, disappointed, sad, bored, in love, or relieved, I at least feel something, but I am entirely void. This books is about three friends doing whatever they can to reach their destination--throw in a bungee jump, a few girls, a little bickering, and car-chase... Well, I just summarized the book for you. Gray could not, no matter how badly I wished he could, hook me into Ostrich Boys. Once again, I'm somewhat to blame. When I read the summary I mentally went back to Stand By Me (the movie, of course, because I sadly haven't read The Body) and Looking for Alaska. Both are great coming-of-age stories dealing with adventure, friendship, life, and death. Ostrich Boys, on the other hand, also deals with those issues, but they are dealt with lightly. I'll explain:What I felt Gray failed to add was the right amount emotion, which felt brushed over like a secondary element. The humor helps deliver a light-hearted, young atmosphere, but I missed the sincerity. Indeed, there are moments when one or all three of the boys are caught brooding; albeit, they are short-lived moments. But I mean: hey! Their best friend just died. I know it's part of our cultural norm for boys to blanket their emotions, but these boys are friends. I didn't expect the characters to mourn via a sob party, letting their emotions run loose like caged animals desperate to be let out. What I did expect was to witness the boys loosen the grip that's strangling their feelings, thoughts, and in consequence: their friendship. With that, I thought they would thicken emotional ties that already have, in some way, connected them for life. Maybe I am wrong, but I'd think Blake, Kenny, and Sim would feel the foundation of their friendship is strong enough to speak to each other. Why do they hesitate? It feels like they don't completely trust each other enough to know the other two--or at least one of the two--has the third's back. In a way, Gray explores the friendship through Blake's conversation with Kayleigh:\"We phone each other every night, and send each other texts all the time too. It's not only when we see each other. Boys don't talk to each other about proper things. I know I can talk to my pals all the time anytime I want and tell them anything.\"I knew there were one or two things I would never dream of telling Kenny or Sim. But maybe I would have talked to Ross about them. . . . \"You're being a bit unfair, aren't you?\" I said. \"Okay, maybe we don't talk all the time, but maybe we don't need to. I know Kenny and Sim would be there for me if I need them. In fact, just today with that bungee jump? The guy who ran it was a total arsehole, but Kenny and Sim were right by my side all the time.\" But will they always be there for Blake, and is Blake willing to always stand up for Kenny and Sim? There is an interesting moment where Blake comes clean and outs his betrayal to Ross. Sim's reaction sets the final landing on where they all stand with one another, and that reaction intrigued me. What I would have given for Sim to open up to his friends about his home life, how he felt about Ross' death, and what the trip meant to him. Regardless, Blake understands Sim better than I or even Kenny, explaining: \"I think Sim looked up to Ross more than any of us. And I bet if Sim could've swapped lives with someone, he would've jumped at the chance of being Ross for a while.\" Hindered by its own restricted emotional range, I feel disappointed over the book\u2019s shallow exploration and inability to move me. But, in the end, would I recommend Ostrich Boys? I give a tentative \"yes.\"This review and more can be read at Midnight Coffee Monster."}, {"userName": "Liza Gilbert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2035961-liza-gilbert", "userReview": "I struggled with how to review this book. The first thirty-fifty pages are hard to read. The rhythm is different, and the author seems to use more words than are necessary.But, after the first fifty pages, it either became easier to read or was written differently. The gist of the story is that four high school boys are tight friends until one of them (Ross) dies in a biking/automobile incident. The other three decide to steal Ross' ashes and take him to Ross, Scotland, a place Ross (the person) always wanted to go.Throughout the journey the boys commit a goodly number of crimes (aside from the corpse theft (ashes, whatever) on their way to Scotland. At times I felt that what the author intended as black humor ended up just being self-absorption and snottiness on the boys' parts.The story and secondary characters were perfectly fine, and the ending was lovely, but I felt like the living boys were criminal snots, mostly unlikable, and really foul of mouth (and that rarely bothers me). I was compelled to finish the novel because I wanted to see what happened to Ross (the person), who ended up being my favorite character even though he was in an urn."}, {"userName": "Joseph Delaney", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22739723-joseph-delaney", "userReview": "I read and write fantasy but occasionally step outside that genre to sample something else.

Blake, Sim, and Kenny just lost their best friend, Ross. Hit by a car while riding his bike, he is gone and they can hardly believe it.After the boys attend his funeral, they decide the ceremony didn't do their friend justice. Ross was so much more than a collection of words and hymns. As a sort of revenge for the fact that he was taken in such unfair circumstances and at an early age, they concoct a plan to honor him in their own way.Ross always dreamed of visiting a town of the same name, Ross, Scotland. The three remaining friends \"kidnap\" Ross's ashes and head to Scotland. The removal of the funeral urn from Ross's home didn't go as smoothly as planned, so their scheme to take a train to Scotland and back in just two days turns into a sort of escape that has Ross's family and the families of the three boys frantic.Just before leaving Ross's house, his father confronted Blake about the possibility that Ross may have taken his own life by riding his bike into the path of the car. Blake is shocked by the question, as are Kenny and Sim, but shortly into their journey there is word that they have been on the evening news. Speculation is that the three boys are part of a suicide pact, and now the hunt is on.OSTRICH BOYS is filled with action and adventure. Each boy is unique - Blake is known as the intelligent one, Kenny is the computer whiz and happens to be the bankroll for their trip until he unfortunately forgets his bag while switching trains, and Sim possesses an amazing knowledge of collective nouns that is sure to fascinate and provide remarkably useless information for readers.Author Keith Gray combines bungee jumping, wild train rides, quirky characters, and the emotional upheaval of losing a close friend to create an incredible tale. A bit of a slow start might discourage some readers, but if they are encouraged to stick with it, most will find it a rewarding read."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3451586-leah", "userReview": "This book has a very different story line than most books I read. It's the story of four 15 year-old boys who experience a tragedy when one of the boys is killed in a bicycle accident. The remaining three boys seek to give their friend a proper funeral by taking his ashes to the one place in Britain he always wanted to go - the place that holds his name - Ross. The boys not only experience adventure, they find themselves searching deep within themselves to solve the biggest question everyone is asking - did Ross cause the accident? And the next important question - did any of them contribute to the situation.I enjoyed the later part of the story when one of the girls they meet is explaining to them the difference between how girls relate to each other and how boys are lacking in that department. Also, the ending did tie in nicely when it related what living is all about - about not knowing for sure what's going to happen next.Due to the deep topic of suicide being continually discussed, I wouldn't recommend this book for young readers. It would say it's more appropriate for older teens and that it's nice to have a book about boys that visits emotions.With the pacing so slow for three quarters of the book and the topic of suicide, I wouldn't say it was for me. I'm still glad I gave it a chance."}, {"userName": "Yami", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963058-yami", "userReview": "what do you call a group of Ostriches??? a \"Pride\"though according to the net it should be a flock, let's for the sake of this novel agree it is a Pride, cos it does make sense if it is intended to be a pun. the boys were between glowing with pride with what they were doing, and hiding their heads in the sand as Ostriches at the same time...enough of the title,about the plot, as it says three boys are going in an adventure to give their friend Ross the funeral he deserves by stealing his \"ASHES\" to a place called Ross.although I suspected the events to be darker and scarier ,since we are in the era of the dystopian novels , but no, actually it was innocent, and there is STILL humans who have heart to actually help. there is no real climax, only the bad luck you might face in an ordinary road-trip especially with normal kids of such age.it felt kind of a novel wrote a generation ago which it is, when young adults were just teens ,no warriors , rebels ,twinkling vampires or whatever they are in the modern literature.but the thing is after all the happy go lucky and the harsh enjoyable trip, the darkness did exist and the source was the three friends who started it all. it came so sneakily that it gave my heart a jolt and I felt their suffocation. it ended with a sad finale and a regret which everyone might have witnessing someone close by passing away, but for those kids the truth behind it was devastating.A good novel, fast paced funny till you reach the last part."}, {"userName": "Eva Mitnick", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/633929-eva-mitnick", "userReview": "Sensible, stocky Blake is our narrator, and he makes it seem an inevitable result of the trio's true friendship with and understanding of their friend Ross that they steal his cremated ashes (not long after he has been killed by a car while riding his bike) and abscond with them to Ross, Scotland. As it turns out, they didn't understand Ross - or each other, or themselves - as well as they thought, but after a whirlwind trip full of missteps, bonding, quarreling, girls, and bungee jumping, things are much more clear. Not necessarily better, just more clear.The nature and mystery of male friendship is slowly revealed between madcap bouts of misadventure, and somehow it all feels realistic. Well - there's a wild ride on stolen motorscooters that has more than a touch of Teen Movie about it, but still, the scene is both funny and ludicrous enough to work.Girls are the ones who know how to be friends, a girl tells Blake at one point. They tell each other everything, give each other presents, and are always there for each other. Boys don't do that! And while Blake feels hotly defensive of his own close friendship with his pals, he doesn't quite know how to convince her; he just knows how important it is.

Mr. Gray certainly knows the way a teenage mind works and he writes with such force that you can't help get sucked in the story.This is the tale of Sim, Burke and Kenny; three 15 year old boys who have just lost his friend Ross in a terrible accident. All of them agree that no one really understood Ross, and feel the need to give him a proper funeral. A while back, Ross told them he wanted to go to a small town in Scotland called Ross -fitting indeed!-. So, the boys decide to steal his friends' ashes and set out on a journey to give Ross' death some sort of meaning. What they discover about themselves and their soon departed friend will affect their lives deeply. The journey gets more and more complicated as they travel along and you can't help rooting for them to reach that Scottish town before their parents or the police catch up to them.I really loved this book: it is just like taking a peek inside your typical, moody teenager boy. You get to experience the fearlessness, the hilarious irreverent thoughts and that warm, comforting feeling that having good friends gives you.

There are antics such as losing the back pack, not enough money,missing a stop in the transit, picking up girls, ans sleeping in an abandoned house.

The boys won't believe it and feel an even stronger mission northward to settle Ross's remains.As I said in the beginning this is a buddy story, there are many incarnations of this kind of plot,but for teens this is bitter sweet. Each character is well formed and the counter play among them believable. The loyalty of the boys and the answers to the enigma that was Ross has an unexpected ending but a truthful one.

It simply made me smile -- there's nothing better than an illegal road trip taken by 15-year-old boys filled with... well, boyish antics (though there was nothing really daring about any of it, besides taking the actual trip). However, that's all it was to me. Throughout the novel, I wanted to know what happened, but it didn't really hook me. I enjoyed the characters and the flaws they clearly all had, but I didn't see much character devlopment. Although their beliefs may have been altered a bit by what happened to Ross, everyone basically stayed the same. I kept expecting the book to be more emotional -- after all, their best friend just died -- but it just wasn't. There were a few heartfelt moments, but they didn't particulary move me to tears or even make me that sad. In this book, the emotions seemed kind of skimmed over, as if the actions were more important.

Their friendship is tested along the way by girls, extreme sports, police chases, and more, but they learn valuable lessons along the way about loyalty and companionship.  Keith Gray did a great job of reflecting the incredible bond that friends share. The book has a common theme of the strength of companionship as well as coming of age and losing some of your innocence you had as a child. The story quickly developed in a way that made you always thinking about what could happen next. The plot, although easy to follow, was very intriguing and made you felt like you were on the adventure too. This is in part due to the fact that Keith Gray made the characters extremely relatable to teenagers. Each character possessed his own characteristic approach to situations and emotions that we can pinpoint to someone in our own lives. The dialogue was also appealing to teenagers because of the slang used by the characters.

I enjoyed it, and kids would enjoy it. Subject matter *may* make it more appropriate for 8th grade and up, although the reading level would not be a challenge for most 6/7 graders.

The messages are easily woven into the story, so kids would not feel like they are being \"preached\" at. Quick read and enjoyed the story, great read for anyone who teaches 6th-8th grade.I gave it a \"3\" because it doesn't meet what I think of as the J.K.
