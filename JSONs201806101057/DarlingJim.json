They're too detailed and literate, and contain lots of descriptions and dialogue. No way they were written by dying, imprisoned girls.* I can't suspend my disbelief over the stupidity of the police. No one seems to care or to be investigating any of the murders. Or robberies. DNA isn't even mentioned until like the 65% mark.* I can't suspend my disbelief over the characters' stupid actions. Characters do or don't do things based on the demands of the narrative, not based on how people actually act. This really irritates me. (Example: Why the hell doesn't Niall just google what happened to Jim? Why does he keep asking people to tell him his fate? Well, it's to keep the reader in suspense, but that's freaking annoying.)* Fiona is a terrible person (sexist, racist, a stalker) and it's hard to feel empathy for her, even during her diary's narrative. (Her other sisters seemed cool, though.)* (This relates to the above.) Civilians are able to find things at the crime scene that the cops miss. Sometimes even years later. AURGH.* There's no way any of this could have happened without a huge media uproar. I understand this was supposed to be a knight's quest, complete with storyteller \"seanchai\" and a crippled prince and feral wolf and damsels in distress, but the modern setting just didn't work for me.

It was. Now I feel like my brain needs a breath mint.A handsome, sexy drifter rides his bright red antique motorcycle into a sleepy Irish town. Think Paul Newman in Long Hot Summer but on a bike - although in this case instead of being a blue-eyed blond, the drifter has \"black Keanu Reeves hair\" and eyes like \"black pools\". Oh, and he's also got a \"sugar coated\" voice \"as smooth as a cat's.\" And not only does our Darling Jim ooze sex appeal but he can apparently mesmerize women from across the street with only a glance, \"read [their:] desires with his eyes closed\" and set sisters at each others throats in jealousy after only one day.And his amazing powers don't end with women, either. Like a weird combination of Charles Manson and John F. Kennedy, Jim's charismatic personality and good looks ensnare the entire town. Although the evidence is overwhelming that Darling Jim is a rapist and killer, everyone but the victims turn a blind eye to it because they are so enamored with him and his amazing storytelling abilities. In fact, his loss drives one woman (who admittedly was eccentric to begin with) over the edge of insanity, causing her to imprison and torture her nieces.And this summary doesn't even touch on the ridiculous subplot of the highly literate and thoughtful diaries written by the nieces as they are dying of rat poisoning and starvation. Would anyone who is waiting to be violently murdered take the time to write that \"time has run out\" and \"here she comes...my dear aunt, dragging her miserable self up the stairs\"? Moerk's characters do. They also have ways of getting those diaries mailed posthumously, to be found and read by a small-town postal worker who, instead of taking the information to the police, decides to \"unravel\" the mystery himself.Because I am trying to be fair, I will say that on the plus side, there is a cat named Oscar in the book. Other than that...well, I suppose it could have been longer."}, {"userName": "Lauren Abel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2114574-lauren-abel", "userReview": "I am torn on this review. Darling Jim was an enjoyable read with interesting characters, a fast-faced plot, and rich description. However, some parts were very unrealistic and this distracted me. When a story is related through something such as a character's letter, the story should not shift between present and past tense or go into lengthy detail about events that happened years ago. No one can recall every detail of an incident that played out over a few weeks years ago, no matter how significant the ordeal. While the girl's stories, told through two letters, are well-written, they are implausible because of the aforementioned facts. The other aspect of the novel that I didn't care for was the subplot of Jim's stories. They were far too long and took away from the main plot. Though the narrator tells us everyone is fascinated by Jim's stories, they couldn't keep my attention. The bizarre ending connected with the stories made me further dislike them. Overall, I probably would not recommend this book. The suspension of disbelief the story required to be plausible combined with the distracting subplot outweigh the novel's good parts, which are the engaging characters, the suspense, and the descriptive language."}, {"userName": "Morana Mazor", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30488471-morana-mazor", "userReview": "Genijalan triler!

The author of DARLING JIM presents his readers with an elaborate and sumptuous tale, some finely tuned dialogue, a tightly crafted plot plus some memorable and engaging characters.The story begins with a bang as an inquisitive Dublin mailman discovers the bodies of three females at a home along his route.Who are these women and how did the meet their untimely end? Author, Christian Moerk has chosen as his narrative vehicle the journals of two of the victims. Through them he introduces us to three sisters, their aunt and a seductive creator of stories named Jim Quick.The journals reveal the sisters as competitive yet devoted to each other, the aunt as an unstable character who swings like a pendulum between frumpy recluse and stylish femme-fatale, and Quick as a cunning, manipulative and charming predator who has cast himself as a wolf in this saga and visualizes any female unfortunate enough to cross his path as easy prey.This book has it all. It is at once fairy tale, a romance, an allegory, a murder mystery, and a psychological thriller with the authors\u2019 version of Irish mythology thrown it for good measure. For any reader who likes a little meat on the bones of their novels, DARLING JIM will provide you with a hearty repast."}, {"userName": "Allison Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/673993-allison-campbell", "userReview": "Like his con artist storyteller, Jim Quick, Christian Moerk weaves a Gothic tale of suspense that draws its audience in, compelling us to find out how it all ends. The structure is intricate, but adds to the mood. The book opens with mail carrier Desmond finding the body of an old woman on his route. When the police investigate, they find not only the body of Moira, but the bodies of two young women who were apparently her prisoners. Further investigation reveals that the girls were Moira's nieces, and that a third prisoner was present at some time, but escaped. The structure immediately pulls in the reader, who knows that something horrible and dramatic must have happened, but like the police, the reader is utterly baffled. When a postal service employee, Niall, happens upon a package with the return address of one of the dead girls and impulsively takes it home with him. It turns out to be the diary of Fiona Walsh, one of the dead girls in the house. She tells the story of Jim, a storyteller who has captivated all the women in town with his fairy tale and dangerous good looks, and who arrives in town just about when mysterious deaths begin to occur. When Fiona's diary comes to an abrupt end, Niall (and the reader) is obsessed with the story and heads to the town where Fiona says the events began to see if he can pick up the thread of how the girls met their fate. He happens upon the diary of Roisin, Fiona's sister, which fills in many of the question marks. The Gothic suspense is thick and irresistible, the story tight, and the fiddly novel structure, which would have seemed amateurish and clunky in another type of book, is perfectly suited to creating the dark, foreboding mood in Darling Jim. The level of detail in the diaries is absurd, of course--no one writes detailed dialogue or remembers every event like that, but that's part of the point, and it sweeps the reader into the story. Darling Jim is an excellent, spooky read for those who like their plot labyrinthine and their suspense relentless."}, {"userName": "Mauoijenn ~ *Mouthy Jenn* ~", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2569271-mauoijenn-mouthy-jenn", "userReview": "I didn't care for this.

When the police arrive, they discover much more: There are 2 more dead bodies hidden in rooms behind locked doors. The bodies come to be identified as those of Moira Hegarty and her two young nieces, Fiona and Roisin Walsh. As the story behind these brutal murders deepens, Fiona's diary is discovered by cartoonist and postal sorter Niall. Niall, entranced with the diary of the dead woman, embarks on a journey to the Walsh's sisters hometown in Ireland to discover the answers to the cryptic clues Fiona left behind. And what he discovers is the family's link to Jim, an itinerant storyteller traveling throughout the area telling his stories at local pubs each night. As Niall follows the clues, he learns of the complicated and cruel fate that Jim spins among the women and of his legion of female fans that follow him all over the country. But there is more to Darling Jim, as he comes to be known. Jim spins an elaborate fable that not only draws his listeners in, but also houses the keys to his dark soul and wicked intentions. Niall's search becomes a race against time after discovering the existence a third missing sister, who may have escaped the fate of her family but who still may be in danger. Niall's journey becomes a long and difficult odyssey as he comes face to face with peril and jeopardy with every step he takes in order to save the surviving sister's honor, and possibly even her life.This was an extraordinarily clever book, and it was a pleasure to relish each and every twist and turn in the story. Written with verve and acuity, the author seemed to have a great handle on timing, believability and dialogue. The characters were quirky and atypical, and each held their own distinctive personality and style throughout the story. The sisters' voices, coming from beyond the grave, expertly captured both their outrage at their situation and their determination for escape.I admit, I didn't think this book was going to be as fun as it ended up being. I mean, with a triple murder haunting the opening pages, one does not expect fun. But the narrative had definite humor mixed with its pathos in a way I didn't expect. I found myself laughing at the oddness and eccentricities within the pages, especially the colorful colloquialisms in the sisters' wordplay. I really liked Niall, who began the story as a lonely loser but soon came to be an adventuresome and unlikely hero. Niall's commitment to the sisters he had never met was touching, and I felt it impossible not to root for this lovable and bumbling character. Jim, too, was interesting, a deliberate and dastardly foe, and his presence resonated through the pages, even when he wasn't the focus of the narrative. He had a dark charisma that made even the most stalwart of women smitten with him.One of the winning things about this story were the sections of the book devoted to the ominous fairy tale that Jim created. This technique was particularly inventive, essentially hiding a story within a story. In fact, this book actually contained three stories: the main narrative, Jim's story, and the back story related by Fiona's dairy. Each of these stories was captivating in different ways, but all worked together and blended well and kept the level of suspense tight and controlled throughout the book. Another thing that I liked was the author's command of the elements and language of his story. He was aptly descriptive without being verbose, and the action and grist of the plot never veered off into unbelievability or precociousness. Though I did guess at one of the aspects of the conclusion of the novel, I wasn't at all disappointed because I thoroughly enjoyed the ride that took me there and appreciated the thought and creativity that the author put into this book.This was not a common story, it had a lot of spunk and vivacity, and kept me turning the pages in anticipation. This is the first novel from Moerk, and based on this book, I will be on the lookout for his next work. I would recommend this book to those who like quick witted mysteries/thrillers with a generous helping of humor. A really fun read."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1960028-sarah", "userReview": "Starting to think I might have been too generous with my two stars. Oh well.Where to start...this book wasn't too compelling, at least in my opinion, I had no trouble putting it down for a while. This storyteller Jim is supposed to be so unbelievably charismatic and sexy on his motorcycle that every single girl is inexplicably drawn to him, even against her will. Except one girl, and that's because she's a lesbian.I'm going to state it once: It annoys me that this was written by a male author, about a man so bewitching the whole town is able to overlook that he's clearly a rapist and a murderer? And if one girl isn't attracted to him, it's because she's a lesbian. What was so great about Jim? He oozed sex appeal apparently, too bad it didn't translate to the reader.Probably the worst thing about this book, besides the sexism and the idea that the guy finding the diaries is supposed to be the 'knight in shining armor' for some reason, (why, exactly? He's not bringing them justice in any way. It was the 3 sisters that carried everything out and braved death) it was the inherent randomness and predictable Gothic elements that existed just for the sake of existing.There was a story about wolves that was supposedly parallel to the real plot about twin brothers, which didn't exactly make sense to me, and I didn't care enough to try and understand it. Everything was revealed in the end like it was some puzzle that all fit together, except there was literally nothing that fit together or made any sense at all. Why is there a guy in a castle, and why is he supposed to be a wizard? Since when were there wizards? Why is he in a wheelchair? How is that relevant? What is the twins relationship? Something about them sleeping with their sister, what? (Did the author say, \"Mysterious pregnancy, check. Castle, check. Romance interspersed with murder, check. How can I make this even more Gothic? Let's add a seemingly random paragraph about incest\"). The protagonist had found his way into the 'castle' to confront the wheelchair bound brother, who was all set to command his henchmen to kill the guy, and then all of a sudden didn't, and let him go, for no reason besides convenience to the plot. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Then one of the sisters left for 3 years and for some reason couldn't tell her sisters why, and predictably it was because she was pregnant with the baby of her rapist the 'wolf' which is infuriating, and also holds no relevance besides being completely and annoyingly predictable. Why does every book that claims to be Gothic have to include a mysterious pregnancy?A lot of the other reviews seem to be complaining about the plausibility of the girls writing eloquent diaries while starving in captivity, but to me that that was the most plausible out of everything. It was almost like the author just grabbed a bunch of Gothic elements and crudely stapled them into a 'story,' claiming to be a 'mystery' when really it was laughable and somewhat insulting. And then even though the police and their dogs found no more evidence at the murder scene, the aunt was able to dig around and conveniently found several pieces of incriminating evidence that the girls left behind and somehow never realized it. I keep thinking of dumber and dumber plot holes as I go on. 'Darling Jim' had a cult following through young girls obsessed with him, because he was just THAT inexplicably amazing that every girl lost her wits around him and hung out on his grave years after he died. There was something about his companion that robbed houses while he had sex with the girls, and then for some reason he killed his companion? Isn't there an easier way to rob houses? Why was he killing girls? Why didn't he kill Fiona? What was the point of raping one of the sisters, just to degrade women even more? And it wasn't really clear to me why he started dating the old aunt, either. To cover his tracks? Weak, just very weak. Now that I think of it, almost nothing that happened seemed to have a legitimate reason behind it, other than plot convenience. And now my review is rambling because of it."}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/640637-colleen", "userReview": "In this story within a story, postman Niall finds the diary of a young woman at the center of a murder mystery, and begins to reconstruct the torrid tale behind the murder house and a series of missing women in the west of Ireland. As we learn more about the three Walsh sisters, their Aunt Moira, and the diabolical itinerant storyteller Darling Jim, a brooding sense of foreboding develops that sets the tone for the entire novel.Between the story within a story within a story format, the mystical elements, and the country appropriate language, I feared this novel might crumble beneath the weight, but instead it transported me to a place of suspended disbelief where everything made its own strange sort of sense. I was most impressed that the author managed to draw out the anxiety to a fever pitch and then maintain that level of intensity until the very last pages of the novel.The writing is crisp, the language spot-on, and the story itself a truly unusual addition to my library.

Not just any fairytales, but scary fairytales that evolve from real-life, as well as real-life unknowingly mimicking fairytales. The sense that there is something sacred about the stories of folklore - that the importance of hearing the end of a tale is worth postponing a justifiably vengeful killing.Mentions of history and historical figures (Eamon de Valera, in particular) in a very honorable way.If there was anything that I didn't like about this book it was that the reason Aoife disappeared for 3 years was too predictable and there was no explanation of where her child was once she came back and the sisters were being held captive by Moira.Lastly, although he was the evil doer, I did love the Irish charming cad of a man, who can charm the panties off any lady, regardless of the evil that truly lies within.

The Irish setting adds to the mystique when the narrative jumps between sisters and to the postman who finds their diaries after their tragic deaths. How did they die? Why did their aunt keep them chained in their rooms? Were they murderers as gossip claimed? And if so, what set these three innocent sisters on the path to destruction? Character studies of each personality involved are detailed and believable as you come to understand what motivated their actions. Would you have done the same if you were in their shoes? How desperate would you have to be to kill someone? As for the true murderer, did he really have a choice, or was it in his nature to hunt prey like a wolf?

Few stories grow in my mind as times goes on, but Darling Jim is one of them.A quick review before I forget some of my initial impressions. This suspense novel was unique in that it incorporated a sort of fairytale feel along with the horror and mystery. It takes place in Ireland, and one of the great strengths of the novel is how very much it gives one a sense of the culture and attitude of the people. This may sound simplistic, but to me, it gave me a fascinating sense of the present-day Irish, in a way that had nothing to do with leprechauns and pots of gold, but in a way that highlighted their culture as different from their English neighbors. This novel was unique, and difficult to describe mix of horror and lust for life.

Esta not\u00edcia perseguiu Christian M\u00f8rk durante anos, at\u00e9 que ele decidiu que era da\u00ed que viria a primeira hist\u00f3ria da sua autoria. Darling Jim, nascido de factos reais, \u00e9 um thriller psicol\u00f3gico que n\u00e3o esquece as lendas e o sobrenatural, que vendeu mais de 38 000 exemplares na Dinamarca e foi traduzido para mais de trinta pa\u00edses. Christian nasceu em Copenhaga mas aos 21 anos partiu para os Estados Unidos. Concluiu os estudos em Hist\u00f3ria, Sociologia e Jornalismo, escreveu na Variety, foi cr\u00edtico de cinema e tamb\u00e9m fez parte dele na Warner Bros. Pictures. Nasceu numa fam\u00edlia de actores e quase foi um acad\u00e9mico mas o seu desejo de escrever um livro falou mais alto. Este \u00e9 o livro.Quando Darling Jim enlouqueceu os leitores pelo Facebook, antes da sua publica\u00e7\u00e3o, eu s\u00f3 pensava que ia ter de arranjar o livro porque se todos estavam loucos por ele, era porque era bom, mesmo bom. Li a sinopse tantas vezes que quase a decorei e, admito, estava quase a morrer de curiosidade mas n\u00e3o consegui compr\u00e1-lo na pr\u00e9-venda e, aos poucos, com as opini\u00f5es ap\u00f3s publica\u00e7\u00e3o comecei a duvidar do facto de querer o livro, at\u00e9 ele ficar esquecido no meio de tantos outros que eu queria, at\u00e9 ter esta oportunidade para o ler.Este livro \u00e9 uma jun\u00e7\u00e3o de conceitos, g\u00e9neros e ideias, onde o thriller psicol\u00f3gico e o sobrenatural se evidenciam. No in\u00edcio da leitura temos uma premissa que consegue suster a curiosidade do leitor, muito devido a escrita bem conseguida do autor, que, atrav\u00e9s de di\u00e1logos flu\u00eddos e de uma narrativa directa, consegue manter o leitor interessado. Sendo um livro simples, sem entrar em grandes dilemas, onde a hist\u00f3ria central \u00e9 a \u00fanica na qual o livro se concentra, seria de esperar uma hist\u00f3ria t\u00e3o bem conseguida como as quest\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas mas confesso que me senti algo desiludida.Apesar da ac\u00e7\u00e3o cont\u00ednua e de ser um livro que \u00e9 f\u00e1cil de ler, n\u00e3o \u00e9 um livro que marque e que recordaremos para o resto da vida. Conforme vamos conhecendo as tr\u00eas irm\u00e3s atrav\u00e9s dos di\u00e1rios, vamos percebendo o mist\u00e9rio a volta das mortes macabras mas, tamb\u00e9m, rapidamente, cheg\u00e1mos a todas as conclus\u00f5es. O livro est\u00e1 bem constru\u00eddo mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 espectacular, e talvez da\u00ed a minha desilus\u00e3o pois a meio do livro j\u00e1 tinha deslindado a hist\u00f3ria toda. Era simples de mais, quando podia e tinha material para ser maior, sem entrar nos exageros em que entrou. O amor pode levar aos actos mais insanos mas para mim, o rumo da hist\u00f3ria, a dada altura, n\u00e3o fazia grande sentido, tinha de haver outra explica\u00e7\u00e3o, tinha de haver ali mais alguma coisa mas n\u00e3o houve. Queria mais drama, mais horror, mais segredos obscuros mas eles n\u00e3o apareceram.A grande falha, \u00e9 a falta daquele que era, a meu ver, o di\u00e1rio mais importante, o da personagem mist\u00e9rio que acab\u00e1mos por nunca chegar realmente a conhecer. Apesar de j\u00e1 desconfiar de qual seria o seu segredo, sinto que teria enriquecido a hist\u00f3ria, t\u00ea-la-ia tornado mais densa, mais real e teria alterado um pouco o sentido do livro. As tr\u00eas irm\u00e3s foram o ponto mais alto do livro pois at\u00e9 a mais forte das mulheres pode cair na cantiga do bandido, e estas irm\u00e3s eram personagens fortes que susteram toda a narrativa e a tornaram muito mais interessante atrav\u00e9s dos seus di\u00e1rios e diferentes perspectivas e personalidades, longe de clich\u00e9s aborrecidos. Tirando as tr\u00eas irm\u00e3s, n\u00e3o achei que as restantes personagens tivessem presen\u00e7a suficiente para sentirmos alguma coisa nem com Jim. Parece que ao lado dos acontecimentos estavam todos meio apagados, s\u00f3 apareciam para fazer o que tinham a fazer e n\u00e3o havia mais nada.O fim s\u00f3 veio confirmar tudo aquilo que eu j\u00e1 tinha percebido e, por isso, n\u00e3o me deu qualquer satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o. A \u00fanica coisa que saliento, \u00e9 que tem uma parte estranha que um dia tenho que reler porque continuo sem perceber o sentido daquilo e acho que nunca vou perceber, sinceramente ou ent\u00e3o j\u00e1 n\u00e3o estava mesmo com vontade de perceber. Por \u00faltimo, a parte sobrenatural, que foi o que gostei mais e durou t\u00e3o pouco. A\u00ed estava o sinistro, o obscuro, a negritude que devia ter povoado o resto do livro, mesmo que depois tenha sido usada para a parte muito estranha do final que eu n\u00e3o percebi.A conclus\u00e3o que tiro \u00e9 que gosto de ser surpreendida, de grandes enredos e de n\u00e3o ter raz\u00e3o no final. Gosto de um livro forte e equilibrado, com p\u00e9s e cabe\u00e7a e n\u00e3o consegui identificar-me com esta leitura. A juntar as expectativas demasiado elevadas a tudo isso, n\u00e3o consegui sentir-me cativada por esta leitura. Esperava muito mais e melhor da hist\u00f3ria, n\u00e3o basta um escritor escrever bem para o livro ser bom.

In a small Irish town, the Walsh sisters, Fiona, Aoife, and R\u00f3is\u00edn, rue the day that a s\u00e9anachai (Irish storyteller) named Jim Quick rode in on his red motorcycle luring them with tales of wolves, murder, and true love. The rich, mythic words Jim recites in packed local pubs haunt each sister\u2019s reality by having surprising parallels to their interactions with him. Jealousy and rivalry are put aside as they seek to uncover Jim\u2019s past when his dark proclivities gnaw at the initial glamour he had cast upon them.Layered with stories within stories, the end of the book is actually revealed in the first chapter. This is remarkably effective in propelling the reader through the pages since the path the story takes is more important than where the path ends. By showing the fate of the characters at the beginning, the reader becomes entranced by the story, yet is constantly reminded by the implacability of the ending. It sets up a complex and rewarding tension throughout the novel.The greatest strength in the book is the individual voice of each sister as she tells her story through a journal. The eldest, red-haired Fiona, understands and unconditionally loves her younger sisters. Aoife is exploratory and free-spirited. R\u00f3is\u00edn is a quirky, dark-haired pixie, who also happens to be an anti-social genius. The perspective of each sister enriches the story, adding new details and motivations to each event as it is remembered. Darling Jim is a fiercely provocative and heartfelt fable of desire, betrayal, and above all - love.Definitely will appeal to fans of The Thirteenth Tale, The Little Stranger, and The Meaning of Night."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1757121-sharon", "userReview": "Danish author Christian Moerk has done something that I, honestly, would have wagered against: created a brilliant modern gothic novel that combines the best of suspense and the ancient Irish art of the seanchai, or storyteller.With his semi-epistolary novel \"Darling Jim,\" Moerk introduces us to Jim Quick, a charismatic storyteller, and three of the women whom he seduces (two sisters and their aunt).

SO we move between modern but mundane small-town Ireland to 16th-century folktale with castles and princes, and back to modern Ireland from the foul-mouthed young and loose women who we come to know pretty well.
