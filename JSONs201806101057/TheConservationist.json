Not all of us read for pleasure after all. Besides it is an achievement of extraordinary proportions when an author manages to stretch the 'show don't tell' narrative device almost to the breaking point yet never failing to accentuate the core themes so realistically. Nadine Gordimer puts her reader in a trance-like state with her hypnotic, lyrical descriptions of minutiae in an unstable world which is perenially straddling the line of divide between outright revolution and a kind of perilous peace. She breathes so much life into the landscape that it manages to appear far more humanly than the protagonist who claims its ownership.There are discomfiting images galore seen through the eyes of Mehring, an opportunistic white farm-owner and businessman - hippos frolicking about in the murky waters of marshes who abort their foetuses sensing an impending drought, cows listlessly grazing about a farm peopled by inhabitants of different races and ambiguous allegiances, black children running about the veld snot dripping from their noses who are so carelessly mentioned in passing that they are taken to be closer in kinship with stray animals than humans, a dead body left to decay underneath water reeds by a lax administration, odious sexual encounters between strangers on a plane - which are potent enough to induce nausea in the reader and reinforce the unnaturalness of a South Africa under Apartheid.\n\"They were useless against the possibility - always present - of a visit from some official, investigator, inspector: many titles that all amounted to the same thing: a white man with the right to serve an eviction order. [ ]...he came in the name of law, there was no defence to keep him out. He must not be antagonized: the only way was roundabout.\"\nThe uncomfortable status quo which Mehring, his black workers and a group of Indians, who conduct business on the fringes of the farm, construct their lives around has much to do with the fact that Ms Gordimer wrote this at a time when the Anti-Apartheid movement had lost steam and its greatest hero was languishing in prison. Thus almost every impeccably crafted sentence is heavily impregnated with metaphors, allusions and analogies and so even a split second of lapse in attention can pose a crucial hindrance toward understanding.The violence and injustice that simmers just beneath the surface of the narrative is not just readily palpable but often threatens to spill over in to the realm of current reality.Mehring, a despicable man in every sense of the term, seems to be caught up in an existential crisis aside from being trapped in a prison of his own making. He is the perfect representative of a cog in the wheel of Apartheid, a white Capitalist who doesn't doubt the sanctity of a social order in which the Africans and Indians are placed on rungs significantly beneath the white man's and believes himself to be a benevolent and just 'master'. But even so he appears to be enveloped by a sense of growing unease and is keenly aware of a prickling reminder of his assured everyday existence being nothing more than a portentous lull before the storm.He is the titular conservationist of a contrived arrangement which is already starting to come apart at the seams and which will inevitably crumble to dust one day. But it is as if he almost knows his efforts at denial are futile which is why his inner world is thrown into a steadily deepening turmoil with each passing day. The proof of this can be found in Mehring's stream of consciousness degenerating into sporadic bursts of incoherence in the denouement.His downward spiral, thus, subtly alludes to the the chinks in the armour of the political establishment and augurs its future demise. \n\"Yes, that's the deal, the hopeful reasoning of the impotence of your kind, of those who are powerless to establish their millenium. The only way to shut you up is to establish the other, the only millenium, of the body, invade you with the easy paradise that truly knows no distinction of colour, creed and what-not...\"\nI find it a wee bit disheartening to notice so few readers picking up a Gordimer book these days. Not only is her Nobel win highly deserved in the light of all her literary activism in the backdrop of Apartheid but she nurtured an ambitious vision of dissecting the power imbalance in race relations from so many dissimilar points of view and brought it to fruition so masterfully. My reading of this couldn't have come at a more opportune time given South Africa is celebrating 20 years of democracy with the recent frenzy around its general elections. Here's to hoping interest in Ms Gordimer's work is revived on this momentous occasion."}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "A good story, competently told, can\u2019t be faulted. But \u2018good\u2019 is sometimes not enough. We might want more than that. We might want a story to carry an impact, not only on us but also on its own subject matter, the time it was set in, the land it describes, the politics of that time. The Conservationist carries such an impact. It hits us in the soft part of our bodies beneath the sternum, winding us, leaving us doubled in two, coughing and gasping. And it hits us early and often. There is no let-up. It hits our liberal notions as well as our conservative ones, our philanthropic impulses as well as our patronising ones. It questions the idea of land ownership and land use, confirming in the end that land belongs to those who live on it, and to those who lie in it after they are dead.So not just competent but well told, this good story, well-told in every way. Gordimer\u2019s words carry a visual quality so that the scenes play out before our eyes as if in a movie:The shop was empty after Jacobus's clumsy shape sauntered out of the light of the doorOr this:The house behind him was dark; on each window a sun, rouged with smoke and dust, slipped down the glass.Or again:He has tipped back the chair and feels the moonlight on his left cheek as if tanning in some strange sun.More:Dust has the effect on his distant hills of a pencil sketch gone over by a soft rubberAnd yet the story is almost entirely one long interior monologue, thinking as a form of conversation, as the main character puts it. For much of the book, we are inside the roomy head of Mehring, a successful entrepreneur, a would-be farmer, a misguided conservationist, an old bull, always alone. Mehring has been the entitled predator of everything he came in contact with in his life and it really ought to be hell being inside Mehring\u2019s head. But no, it\u2019s more than comfortable; Mehring is not an alien. His thoughts are our thoughts even if in different contexts. And he is more honest than many of us.In this book, the fortunate are those who get to lie in a field of shining lucerne by a flowing river for ever and ever. Others, just like the giant peace sign painted on the side of a water tank by a hopeful teenager, end up face-down in the mud on the side of a highway. Such is natural justice, and for all his faults, Mehring understands that message better than anyone........................................................................................................This book was written in the early seventies when John Vorster was prime minister of South Africa and the anti-apartheid movement had temporarily lost momentum; the book reflects the upheavals of that time perfectly. Gordimer herself resisted apartheid and all forms of discrimination and segregation throughout her life even refusing to accept being shortlisted for the Orange Prize, an award that recognizes only women writers. I cheered when I heard that.I'm not recommending that you read this book; you readers all have your own agendas and I never seek to influence others. But I do want you to know that this shining book exists, and that it holds many, many truths beneath its layers. That\u2019s enough."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa", "userReview": "If you've read Mantel's Wolf Hall, you know there's a bit of adjustment at first once you realize \"he\" almost always refers to Cromwell because you're inside his head. Such is the case here, though the reader is granted a reprieve now and then when an omniscient voice takes over in some chapters. I say reprieve because it's tough being in Mehring's head and I felt relief when he engaged in dialogue (not that often) with someone other than himself.Inside his head, the reader also needs to determine who the \"you\" is that Mehring is remembering and having imaginary conversations with. Mostly it's with his polar-opposite, leftist married lover (Mehring himself is divorced and seems to have had various flings, many unseemly) whom he's helped to flee the country, but at other times it's with his long-haired, barefoot sixteen-year-old hippie son Terry (the book was published in 1972). When they're together, Mehring struggles for topics to converse with Terry; when they're apart, Mehring thinks of the many things he should've said, but we all know how that goes: in your thoughts you control the other's responses. Mehring sometimes switches from one \"you\" to the other within the same paragraph; once the \"you\" has been established and sentences reread, meaning becomes easier.Mehring is a rich white powerful industrialist who owns a luxury flat in the city and four-hundred acres in the country. He's spending more and more time in the country, a place he previously visited only on the weekends and originally envisioned as a love nest. He's become possessive of the land, though \"his\" black farm workers' abodes could do with some upgrading, of course: \nWith a new roof, it would be a better house than any of them has at the compound, but that's out of the question because he has discovered, coming there in the evenings, it has the best view of any spot on the whole farm.\n The harshness of nature reaps danger (especially for those without resources) but also beauty, and Mehring believes the latter will always win out. This conservationist not only wants to keep his life (and land) the way it is, he increasingly wants it all for himself.From the opening pages, he and the novel are haunted by the corpse of a murdered black man discovered in Mehring's third pasture. Not caring who committed the murder of a black man, the police bury the man near where he has been found. Mehring's anxious, claustrophobic (for the reader) thoughts return to the burial site over and over, as do thoughts of a missing ring, lost by his lover as she visited the property with him before he'd bought it.The results of a flood brought on by a cyclone are described thoroughly and as I read those passages yesterday -- on the ninth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina -- the words rang true for my area too: \nHanks of grass, hanks of leaves and dead tree-limbs, hanks of slime, of sand, and always hanks of mud, have been currented this way and that by an extraordinary force that has rearranged a landscape as a petrified wake."}, {"userName": "\u00b7Karen\u00b7", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen", "userReview": "-Why not just buy it and leave it as it is?...If I had your money I'd buy it and leave it just as it is.--No farm is beautiful unless it's productive.--You hear these things and believe them because they sound 'right'.

There is something dead and hidden on his land, which he manages to ignore. We are inside his head - we hear his thoughts, we hear his conversations - mind the dash -, questioning his ex-mistress, his son, the activist, the objector, those who see change coming, know it must come, even if they do not want the storm to hit them, and escape, escape to London, to New York. Mehring is used to taking, and he goes on taking. Women, girls. (They want it really).Mehring is blind, and continues to be blind.

Africa, come back.The narrative is disconcerting, swirling in and out, sometimes internal, sometimes external, Mehring addresses sometimes his mistress, sometimes his son, sometimes changing so abruptly between the two that it is hard to keep up. Go back, look again, look again. The whole is undermined and undercut by epigraphs from a quite different narrative, from The Religious System of the Amazulu. And does this sound like a historical, political tract, worthy but dull? Oh but it shouldn't sound that way. Such sensual, such sensuous writing. Colours, smells, sounds. Silver and gold.

When the body of a black man is found in Mehring's farm outside of Johannesburg, you realize that Gordimer is writing with a capacity for gruesome metaphor. There is the immediate symbolism of the body itself, or how the land was taken violently and how unease and resentment still lingers between White and Black. Mehring is an industrial magnate playing at farming and toting along his mistress - he pays the black farmhands to do the work for him. It is easy to take this book as a historical set-piece of apartheid South Africa, to see the distinctions between Rich Hedonist Elites and the working poor of all types - Boers, Indians, Africans. But Gordimer's writing always hints at something underneath, of Mehring's own emotional wounds and his inability to do anything about them, or perhaps the easy activism of his mistress and son still disguising their inactivity. It is perhaps comforting to say the right things, things which Mehring vaguely denies, but what is changed from it?This is a book which takes almost biblical affectation toward the landscape, and the farm itself is ruined and the body washes up again, almost in a 'death and resurrection' theme. Furthermore, the apparent difficulty of the book comes from Gordimer's ability to move in and out of Mehring's head - to take his own emotional turmoil and then move away to a more dispassionate perspective. Add to this long langorous depictions of the landscape and the locals, both slipping out of Mehring's fingers, and dashed conversations, and one finds a book of uncommon literary and emotional difficulty."}, {"userName": "Nathan", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25213052-nathan", "userReview": "This a book that should be mandatory reading for anyone with even a passing interest in social justice. I get it, that's a big claim, but I have a feeling that when bell hooks coined the phrase \"white supremacist, capitalist, patriarch\" she had people like Mehring in mind. Gordimer skillfully delineates the borders of his privilege in this volume, speaking no nonsense and cutting straight to the meat of the issue. And while Apartheid is dead, racial segregation is a thing of the past, and questioning of gender roles is becoming more widespread, The Conservationist still has power and social relevance. Take this conversation, for instance, where Mehring talks to his mistress about his sexual desires:  -Shall I tell you something, Antonia? You don't know it, but there's a special pleasure in having a woman you've paid. Now and then. I can't explain it. It's very clear-cut. For that one night, or that one afternoon or day, whatever it is. You've bought and paid for everything.--There will be absolutely no unfulfilled emotional obligations on either side, hanging on afterwards.--No, no, you see deep meanings in everything. Sorry to disappoint you. Just the feeling that you're not only taking this woman, you've also paid for her-...-My god, you want to convince me you can buy anything. Mehring and his wholly-owned subsidiaries.-which is not only typical of Mehring's attitude throughout the novel, but the attitudes of many men about sex. They think that there is some secret formula to be with someone, that romantic connections become ownership. As in Mehring's case, all it leads to is unhealthy relationships and bitterness. Mehring doesn't want just sex to be about money, he wants his wealth to allow him to control every facet of his life. He sees his black workers as objects, but also as inferior and unable to survive without him- he never really trusts Jacobus even after years of successful work together. He sees women, if not needing money, needing coercion to sleep with him- he sexually assaults a sleeping teenage girl on a plane. His wealth breeds the need to possess, and he feels like no item or person should be beyond his grasp. Gordimer does an excellent job of building the pressure in his head, he starts out fairly innocent, but by the end it's clear that Mehring is not at all decent. Mehring's life stands as an astonishing allegory. As Gordimer wrote The Conservationist, the anti-Apartheid movement was beginning to gain footing. Mehring stands for the class of people fighting against them. So I'm fascinated by Gordimer's choice to not flat out smear him. Protest literature has a tendency to make the world black and white, but it's clear that the intent here is not to bring out rage but to inspire thought. Mehring is relatively kind to his workers. He gives them nice shoes when they ask, he gives Jacobus good food, and he is undemanding when he feels failed by Alina. And yet in his mind there is still disgust aimed at the people who support him. If even good bosses hate their workers, there is a systematic, internalized prejudice she's calling out here. And yet, for such heady topics, this is not a novel without hope. Mehring's narrative arc opens and closes with images of failed fertility; first eggs stolen from nests, and in the end, an unproductive farm wrecked by fire and flood. Each has a profound impact on Mehring. I propose that in these images, Gordimer implies a failure for Mehring's toxicity to be passed on. Because the natural world comes with order, the symbols of his grasp on the land have been destroyed. Because the social world comes with order, people like Mehring's grasp of South Africa are weakening. Terry refuses to think the way his father does, Antonia refuses to be with someone so backward, and the forces that make social change happen punish Mehring for thinking of them as something within his realm of control."}, {"userName": "Inderjit Sanghera", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900800-inderjit-sanghera", "userReview": "Reading like a series of impressions, the disjointed narrative style is counterbalanced by the ethereal imagery which Gordimer conjures up; whether it be the stifling, suffocating South African heat or the rambunctious river torrents, Gordimer conjures up a South Africa which appears to be spiralling towards violence, a South Africa seen mainly through the eyes of Mehring; an empty vessel of a man whose inner self is nothing more than a hodge-podge of greed and venality, a man who seems to be perpetually on the point of mental disorientation.Mehring it emotionally distant from those around him, he finds it difficult to form anything other than superficial connections with others; his emotionally empty relationship with a married women, his sneering condescending of his black farm workers, his tense relationship with (in his eyes) effete son, Mehring exists as a ghost, haunting those around him, lugubrious and leering, walking beneath the blood orange moon or the hazy winter morning;\u201cIt\u2019s a cataract over the fierce eye of the sun; it\u2019s even possible, some days, to look straight at the sun as if you are staring at the prism deep in the under-water radiance of a star sapphire\u201dThe disorientation brought about by Mehring\u2019s gradual mental breakdown continues to seep into the novel. Mehring is in many ways the atypical white, conservative South African man of his age, a man solely concerned with power and money and whose narrow-minded views reflect the prejudices engendered by his privilege. \u2018The Conservationist\u2019 is a flawed, if original and often poetic exploration of the mindset behind men whose ignorance and greed perpetuated the societal inequalities of South Africa."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "This is a novel to admire, to tremble in sheer awe at the power of Gordimer's language, her mastery of sensuality, and the importance of its themes: the skewering of apartheid during a time when the anti-apartheid movement floundered, leaderless and without much will (early-mid 1970s). It is a tough novel to love. I felt alienated by the dense language and the stream-of-consciousness writing and frustration at being trapped inside Mehring's morally bankrupt brain. Which of course is the paradox of this brilliant, difficult novel: Mehring represents white South Africa and to see the world through his eyes, as we do in The Conservationist, is to trap the other characters--black, Indian, women--in a kind of subordinate, pitiful stasis. Nadine Gordimer deliberately holds us at arm's length as Mehring considers the human world around him, but draws us in close when showing us the land. Shortly after book opens on Mehring's country farm, twenty-five miles outside Johannesburg, the corpse of a black man is discovered by the river. No one knows who he is or how he died. The local authorities simply bury the man where he is, promising to collect the body later and investigate. Mehring is a bit put out at first, thinking of that dead body on his property, but after a while, the man troubles him much less than the hippos who abort their fetuses in the river, signs of a worsening drought. Mehring purchased this farm as a tax write-off and as a weekend fancy. It isn't terribly productive, but he doesn't need the income--he's a mining executive. The land and its cattle are tended by a collection of black families and undocumented workers who drift over from nearby shanty towns. Mehring holds dominion over so much land-conquering its underground during his day job; plucking at its veldt on the weekends. He is apolitical, bored, lonely, a beneficiary of a society built on the backs of the oppressed. His wife has left him, as has his mistress. His son flees to Namibia--a nation-state seeking independence from South Africa-- to escape compulsory military service. To keep himself company, Mehring flirts with sexual predation, all the while imagining himself above the cocktails-and-flirtations of South Africa's smart set. He really is despicable. God. But again, the genius of Gordimer is that you are inside Mehring's head, and of course he sees himself as enlightened and obliging--even a young girl sitting next to him on the plane opens her legs and allows his fingers inside. What was he supposed to do? Opportunity for the white man is everywhere, just for the taking.The land has the final say. Biblical rains and flood end Mehring's farm fancies. The flood returns the body of a slain man to the surface, to be buried properly. But it would take another twenty years after the publication of The Conservationist for the flood of public opinion and political will to end the shame of apartheid. The Conservationist won the Booker prize; it was also banned in South Africa.

Similar to Carlos Fuentes' \nThe Death of Artemio Cruz\n, in which Artemio's life and death serve as metaphors for the historic arc of the Mexican Revolution and the corrupt PRI party it spawned, the anti-hero of The Conservationist is Gordimer's metaphor for a South Africa apartheid system that is impossible to conserve despite the wishes of its White population.In fact, I'm sure there is some college undergrad out there who is writing a paper about Gordimer's imagery of the colonial aesthetic of non-native plants destroying the sacred bond between native Africans and the local flora and fauna. But what is impressive about Gordimer - and what I think she'll always be remembered for - is her ability to write so seemingly effortlessly from the male, female, Black, White, and Indian voice. Sometimes she even seems more comfortable writing as a man than a woman (always stressing that men have no rational control over their sexual compulsions).\nMithcell Park, DurbanI bought the book from a used bookshop on Florida Road in the Morningside neighborhood of Durban. Two blocks up is Mitchell Park where each night wealthy White South Africans in lycra and workout suits go jogging and speed-walking with dogs the size of horses. Across the street is Vida e Caffe where the same couples and groups of friends gather each morning to catch up over their first cup of coffee. The whole area is a slice of Europe spooned up and put down on Durban's best plot of land.While walking around the neighborhood and reading The Conservationist I had the sense that South Africa's battle for and against Apartheid had less to do with power and more to do with taste. So long as the garden aesthetic - the boutiques, the cafes, the wine bars - of South Africa's best neighborhoods isn't threatened, most White South Africans are able to endure the idea of a Black ruling class."}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124789-trevor", "userReview": "I am ambivalent about this book.

I felt like I was at one of those poetry readings where the poet is reading the poem entitled something like \"A purple evening on the hood of my 1965 Mustang with the engine turned off thinking about existentialism while the moon rose over the hills to the East: A Reverie\"--the kind of writing that lays out details in a way not meant to be descriptive but to sound profound, even when they are not. It doesn't help that she starts a chapter \"Golden reclining nudes of the desert.\" It's there at the beginning, one line, with a break between it and the next paragraph. I'm just not into this kind of writing. I enjoy a more simple, understated style.I'm sure a lot of this was just my approach to the novel, but I couldn't help feel like the narrator was drolling on and on in this way, enunciating alliteration and assonance to show how clever it was. I was most touched by the simple passages, not by the ones that were obviously worked and reworked to have a rhythm that screams at the reader--look at this rhythm! This is just my personal taste. I don't want to discourage anyone about this novel. I feel awfully pretentious saying all of that about a Booker Prize winner, let alone about a Nobel Prize winner. Griping about style in a book of obvious substantive value is a probably petty. Gordimer's writing is important. She has been incredibly progressive with her portrayals of race, and this book was one of those important works. Unfortunatlely, this particular book felt dated to me.

No doubt, this is a difficult read, both in style (long, rambling sentences, extended stream-of-consciousness passages, non-English words scattered throughout) and in substance (it's about apartheid, and also, not much actually happens). The best way I found to describe it is that it's like an impressionist painting -- when you're close up, in the thick of reading it, it just seems like a blur of random words, but after you step back a bit (say, when you've finished a chapter), things snap into focus and you realize what you've just read. It's kind of an exhausting endeavor. But I did feel that I learned some things while reading it: about South Africa, race relations, sexual power dynamics, what \"veld\" and \"vlei\" and various other Afrikaans words mean.

Just when you think you're going to drop off, there's an episode of startling and perverted eroticism. That weakness for young women, it's going to be the death of Mehring, you just know it.

The novel\u2019s title is interesting, in that Mehring, Gordimer\u2019s white South African farm owner protagonist, would almost certainly not consider himself to be a conservationist, in the environmental sense. At times boorish and misogynistic, Mehring is absolutely opposed to any changes in the status quo of apartheid South African political organisation and attempts to keep everything on his farm running smoothly by keeping firm control over his Black workforce. Mehring can be said to be Gordimer\u2019s personification of what was fundamentally wrong with the South African state at the time that she wrote the novel; a privileged businessman, who owns and runs a farm which he only visits at weekends, yet expects to be able to keep it fully under control. However this is too simplistic an assessment; Gordimer imbues Mehring with a real love for the land that he owns and she conveys this through the frequent paragraphs where Mehring contemplates the breathtaking beauty of the environment that surrounds him. Mehring knows that his farm is neither particularly profitable nor productive, yet he keeps coming back to it because he is beguiled by its setting. There are frequent allusions as to why Mehring bought the farm; it was intended to be a secret love-nest for him and the married woman who he was having an affair with at the time. The woman is never named, and it is hinted that their relationship was brief, yet Mehring\u2019s thoughts frequently return to the occasion when she came with him to look over the farm before he purchased it. Her refrain \u201cI\u2019d leave it all just as it is\u201d seems to haunt Mehring, and it is arguably this more than anything that makes him the conservationist of the novel\u2019s title.With the woman long gone, Mehring seems to only gain satisfaction from his relationship with his farm. He finds his other human relationships wanting; his ex-wife in America is a pest, his (implied) gay son is a disappointment to him and he retreats further and further from his circle of fellow businessmen friends and their families as he seeks to avoid their company. Mehring is seemingly haunted by this one conquest, although she is not the only one by any means; Gordimer portrays him as a suburban lothario, who also has an unhealthy interest in teenage girls.This interest is systematic of what Gordimer intends the novel to represent on a macrocosmic level. Mehring takes what he wants, without thinking through the consequences or of the damage he does, and this can be said to be representative of the South African state at the time. On a couple of occasions Mehring appears to get caught out, but Gordimer\u2019s stream-of-consciousness third person prose, lacking in quotation marks when characters speak, makes some of these episodes difficult to understand. Perhaps Gordimer intended these revelations of discovery to be deliberately ambiguous but I did find them very hard to follow. Although this makes the novel flow in a naturalistic way between prose and dialogue, the ensuing lack of clarity for me is the one flaw in what is otherwise a beautiful novel. Mehring\u2019s relationship with his Black African members of staff seems to be relatively neutral. Although he doesn\u2019t help them to achieve emancipation, he doesn\u2019t treat them badly either. He recognises that staff like Jacobus work hard for the farm, even if they sometimes take small liberties while he is away. Gordimer makes it clear that she does not support the Blacks\u2019 impoverished and inferior state (one particular passage concerning a Christmas coupon is particularly poignant) but she doesn\u2019t use Mehring as a means of enforcing this system upon them; rather she criticises the political system itself, in the form of shadowy references to the police and what they do to Blacks who don\u2019t possess the appropriate papers.The Conservationist is a novel about apartheid, that isn\u2019t explicitly political. It makes a powerful statement against apartheid without directly condemning it; every word drips with anger at the injustice of the suffering of the marginalised Black South African characters, who are clearly metaphors for the Black South African community as a whole. But these appear to be almost incidental compared to the size and power of the South African landscape, which is the true star of Gordimer\u2019s novel. This is a majestic paean to the rapidly changing South African countryside; a brilliant work that, while calling for change in its unjust politics, evokes a geographical location that truly deserves to be conserved."}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1083046-colleen", "userReview": "Mostly follows the interior monologue of Mr. Mehring, a wealthy white colonial industrialist in South Africa, who has bought a farm 25 miles from his city apartment. His farm is managed by a group of extremely poor indigenous Blacks lead by Jacobus, who all seem to have infinite patience. Mehring's life is so removed from them he barely empathizes with them. And he has grown distant from the members of his own class who spend their spare time partying and trying to fix him up with single eligible women, and asking him to serve on yet another company board. He only really cares about the leftist married lover who has moved away to Europe and his teenage son who is a long-haired, barefoot, hippie student, spending his vacations with friends rather than dad. He also cares about his farm, but the weather and other disasters challenge his idealized vision of what it could be. The farm really is his only connection to an increasing alienation from his 1970s life. The writing might be difficult to follow because Gordimer doesn't use quotation marks, and most of the conversation is between what Mehring imagines people would say and how he would answer. The book opens with an unidentified dead man found face down in Mehrings willows near the river that runs next to his farm. No one knows him and the police don't even bother to investigate the murder. The man is another Black, of course. It's probably the strangest murder mystery I've ever read, because it reveals so much of the social structure of the society rather than delving into the passions that drove the crime.

We see the world through his eyes, and we see how well it serves him, keeping him wealthy and comfortable. While he may notice that some suffer and are oppressed, he is not moved to do anything that would make a difference for them. Instead, he justifies his indifference with a sense of racial and class superiority.Gordimer captures the mental framework of someone who feels little or nothing for the misfortunes of others. What is interesting for the reader is that it requires an effort to step out of his mind and see his thoughts and behavior for what they are -- insensitive, self-serving, and at times brutal.Gordimer finds him at a time in his life when he is middle-aged and living alone, no longer married, his grown son estranged from him, and his mistress not all that endeared to him. While money, property, and influence keep him at a safe distance from the political troubles slowly encroaching on his private world, Gordimer reveals his physical and emotional isolation. His defense is to cut his losses and retreat even farther into his solitary world.

Reading it, one feels besmirched simply by being privy to the perspective of its White anti-hero, Mehring.

Unlike the dispossessed and powerless characters who work for and around him and enjoy companionable relationships with others, he \u2013 the rich, powerful white man in South Africa under Apartheid \u2013 is alone.

Although Mehring is not a comfortable protagonist--he is not a people person and at one point chants \"My possessions are enough for me\" (or something to that effect), which could make him a materialist caricature--by the time you are through with him, you have adopted his perspective implicitly and are somehow satisfied with his point of view.

In many ways, the real story of The Conservationist takes place around the edges of Mehring\u2019s story \u2013 just as he tries to control the land but finds it growing apart from him and away from him, he can\u2019t quite control his own story. He is never the true story, even of his own narrative. Apartheid rules his country; it is overwhelmed with state-sanctioned violence, a quiet and guerilla war simmering within a police state, poverty, and oppression; and out in the veld, Mehring buys a farm to avoid taxes and to find peace away from the city and his failed life (an ex-wife, a son who despises him, a mistress who has since dropped from view). And all this happens at best at the outskirts of Mehring\u2019s narrative, of his farm, of his life. \tThe book doesn\u2019t ever talk about Apartheid, or racism, or Mehring\u2019s role as a clearly influential man in the private sector of South Africa in the mid-1970s. Mehring purportedly seeks the quiet life \u2013 he revels in his days at his farm. But not only does he never truly learn how to get things to grow on the land he purported loves, but he seeks this quiet life by shunning everything around him, including his family; the world around him; and the people he passes. It is a deliberate indifference, most clearly illustrated by the black man, a stranger found dead on his property. Mehring treats him as an inconvenience, best cleared off by an indifferent and unwilling police department. The man is eventually buried on Mehring\u2019s property by Mehring\u2019s employees, who mourn the stranger\u2019s life; and eventually the body reemerges with the rainy season. Mehring is haunted by this stranger\u2019s body \u2013 and that, in itself, is telling: Mehring is haunted only by the body and not by the person who used to occupy that body, because Mehring did not quite seem to grasp that; just as he cannot quite grasp that his ownership of the land cannot quell the moral cross-claims that black South Africans \u2013 including those who tended his land \u2013 had to the farm and to the veld. Focused as he is on the life he wants to lead, he cannot see the role he plays in a larger and more troubled nation, even when its realities \u2013 unclaimed bodies; estranged sons; poverty along the road \u2013 seem impossible to ignore. And indeed they are, but for Mehring\u2019s deliberate indifference, his willingness to pay the price (or have others pay it) of his desire to conserve himself and his land.\tIt makes me realize, belatedly, that The Conservationist is an apt successor to Farrell\u2019s books, though it is more subtle in its critique of Apartheid than Farrell was in its critique of colonialism. Each book, though, is told through the eyes of the non-sympathetic characters. If these characters attract your attention as the main attraction of the story, it soon becomes clear that the real story is what unfolds beyond the edges of that character\u2019s world \u2013 what is shaped by and shapes the protagonist. \tGordimer is not necessarily the easiest writer to read; The Conservationist jumps back and forth in time and memory, making it different to sort out the edges of memory or sort out a proper timeline of events and characters. She moves in and out of characters\u2019 consciousnesses, often without warning; and she is not sparse in her imagery. But it is worth taking the time to find and follow her cadence. Once that triggers, it is easier to follow the characters and the story. It is worth the time it takes to fall into that pattern of her writing style."}, {"userName": "Jos\u00e9 Toledo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13332735-jos-toledo", "userReview": "The Conservationist is Nadine Gordimer's most intense, and certainly most poetic, novel. Its meticulous details and documentary exactitude combine to create an elaborate web of meanings where each object detailed or evoked carries symbolic implications for the society that South Africa was at the time of the novel's publication, and which forty years later still resonate with moral relevance. It is this same elaborate style which also avoids explanations and leaves the reader free to interpret. My favorite kind of reading, filled also with all kinds of ironies. Mehring, the protagonist, is not the typical chauvinistic Boer; instead he is tolerant, but not liberal. He uses the purchase of his farm as a tax-deductible expense, yet fancies himself a gentleman farmer. He also likes to think of himself as a nature conservationist by not altering much of the farm he has purchased, which in reality is as barren as his own moral compass and, symbolically, of the white dominant South Africa he represents. He is also a colonialist and a sexual predator, putting forth claims on land and women neither of which belongs to him.With the narrative structured around Zulu creation myths, Gordimer looks at Nature in her native land as a harbinger of things to come; things that do not bode well for the white dominant race. Not aware that this is compelled by his own moral vacuum (or perhaps, yes), Mehring foresees a future in which it will all be taken over by the blacks, obliterating his own passage in land and life. If we look at this work with the urgency with which it was written back in 1974, inextricably tied to the tragedy of apartheid, one cannot help but respect, admire, perhaps love the insightfulness and poetry of it. Seamus Heaney called Gordimer a \"guerrilla of the mind,\" and it is because of this kind of book that she deserves that great compliment. She shakes the reader's conscience, writing History from the inside out with a clinical eye that it yet not so proud as to avoid lyricism and philosophy. With sometimes just a couple of words the author jabs at the reader's conscience, like when one white farmer tells a black worker about the actions of another white farmer by referring to him as \"this master.\" The phrase goes off like a bomb in your face!The intensity of Gordimer's writing \u2013here at her best\u2014demands serious concentration, especially when the impressionistic narrative can derail the reader's focus, especially when she situates us inside her character's mind, an increasingly unpleasant place to be in.

Though it is written in the third person and occasionally provides insight into other characters' thoughts and experiences, perspective is largely limited to Mehring, a rich, white, middle-aged businessman. He is a loner who lives and works in the city but owns a large piece of farm land, which is inhabited and run by a group of poor black families and their various associates. Mehring is not a likeable host for the story; he is abusive to women, racist in his attitudes and treatment of black people, and cynical and unyielding about any possibilities for social or political change in South Africa. Not all his character traits are negative; he does seem to care about the land, his insecurities and loneliness are laid bare for us, and at times he pities or even identifies with the powerless. Despite any judgements of his character, as readers we become deeply involved and invested in what happens to Mehring, especially as relates to the dead body that is washed up and hastily buried by authorities on his farm. Our attachment to Mehring is due mostly to Gordimer's writing style, which is spare in structure and dense in content. There are no chapter numbers or chapter headings, and most strikingly, no quotation marks or speaker tags to indicate and clarify dialogue. Thus, we are forced to experience the story with Mehring's unexplained impressions, memories, and imagined conversations running through the action. This makes for a jumbled, perplexing reading experience that, while perhaps maddening, reinforces Gordimer's non-preachy depiction of apartheid South Africa. The Conservationist encourages thought and dialogue by forcing readers into the point of view of a character who might otherwise be oversimplified and written off as the enemy (rich, white, powerful male). Mehring, in the end, is forced to see things from the other side as well, victimized by his former victims and haunted by the dead body, which refuses to stay buried."}, {"userName": "Madhuri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/875812-madhuri", "userReview": "When you write from a divided home, it is inevitable that the divide manifests itself in your writing. Writers from South Africa, I suppose, therefore feel compelled to return to apartheid in some form- either in Coetzee's Disgrace or in Gordimer's 'The Conservationist'.In fact, Conservationist did remind me terribly of the other. The white man with a loosely strewn together life, a farm with black workers, the divide and the mutual acceptance across the divide.The book primarily consists of self-monologues of a white millionaire in an apartheid South Africa, who buys a farm in the suburbs. The monologues and thought chains draw out his rootlessness and the emptiness of his life. The title very beautifully captures his essence - a man comfortable with the state of affairs, disinterested in freeing his country out of the apartheid which serves him well. In other words, a man who wants to conserve what is. Very subtly, Gordimer has mocked this entire group of these 'comfortable' people, which were instrumental in maintaining the racial divide.At other times, she delves into the monologues of a few others - significantly the rich man's farm manager Jacobus and an old Indian shopkeeper living close to the farm. Both these men too, are reluctant to any kind of change - comfortable in the continuum. Through them, she tries to give the perspective of those discriminated against and the immigrants, always struggling to only keep their feat on the foreign land.The Conservationist is a rewarding reading, even though it is a bit tedious because of its monologues. The 'You' in the monologues keeps referring to several different people - the son, the mistress, the ex-wife, and you have to pay attention or the monologue floats away fast.
