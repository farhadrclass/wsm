The major cities like Berlin, Paris, London and Rome, all went through a metamorphosis of fear prior, and eventually recovered bearing the battle scars in the years after. For certain people though, the war will never end, in their minds at least. For Former Nazi Judejahn, conflict still rages on. In the streets, in the Church, and in music.The centre stage is a post-war Rome, for Wolfgang Koeppen's devastating novel on German resilience, it takes a prototypical German family and dumps them in Italy's capital to play out a reunion that none of them wants. We have four males, Friedrich Wilhelm Pfaffrath, his son Siegfried a composer, his cousin Adolf, who is on the way to becoming a Catholic Priest, and his stubborn father the Nazi Judejahn, a man who escaped death in Nuremberg and now trains Arabic militants. He has just arrived in town to secure an arms deal, he is a thoroughbred fascist, who chillingly dominates the story even though he is only part of it. He simply made my skin crawl, and may as well have been wearing an SS uniform. There are woman also, but they largely remain on the fringes. Each character has a different vision of what they stand for in terms of the old and new Germany, it's a battle in essence of who gets to represent their homeland in the most authentic way. The set up is straightforward, but reading it was anything but. There were no chapters, and hardly any breaks in writing, moving between a first person narrative and third person without you hardly even noticing, the novel felt like more of a long prose poem, or a deftly choreographed ballet of outrageous contrivance, looked at by the reader with growing dread. Part of Koeppen's point is the Church and the state, the music and the camps, you can't have one without the other. It comes as no surprise that it's setting happens to be Rome, it was there or nowhere, Judejahn feels true disgust towards the Italians, and the fate of Mussolini still boils up inside. Whilst he is outraged at his weak minded son for entering the church, thus becoming an enemy. There is a whole micro plot about German presence in Italy, and references to German history, from Roman times, right up to when the novel was published in 1954. Koeppen sits on the shoulders of his main characters like a bird with a keen eye, and passes judgement over them in ways that are both brutal and mindful of goodness, with a masterly touch that is parable of decadence. Very much a product of it's time, it shatters the illusion that a reformed nation might rise from the ashes. For Koeppen, he doesn't believe that mankind can be rectified, the book carries a clear message instilled with a deep sense of the futility of life. Images of death and destruction reign supreme in his vivid descriptions of time during war, and Rome offers no sanctuary to these tortured German souls, still dragging their heels through the blood of the fatherland. A stark contrast between German greed and Italian ambience.It is a story of fathers and sons, saints and sinners, but Koeppen never allows his characters to be more than archetypal figures in a plot interspliced with a sensual rendition and perceptive vignettes of Roman life. The Germans move around the city like a damnation dance set to Koeppen's evocative prose, a poetic language that speaks volumes for his talents as a writer. Some say this is worthy of masterpiece status. That he should be classed in the same league as Mann, B\u00f6ll and Grass. Others say he hit a raw nerve in Konrad Adenauer's fledgling democracy with the massage that those who had colluded with the Nazi regime were only hiding under the mantle of the newly restored civil society, opportunists now as they ere then. I found Death in Rome a comprehensive and intricate provocation of an entire nation. It chilled my blood, and really made me think, deep down, hard. It's the sort of book to read again and pick up on any finer details that weren't noticeable the first time round, because I kid you not it was never an easy read and it's overall structure may be off putting for some. For me though, it gets top marks."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony", "userReview": "In retrospect, it should be obvious, of course. I cannot explain why it took me 100 pages to get it. Dotage, maybe. I mean, is there any other famous novel which includes death and some Italian city in its title? Lemmethinklemmethinklemmethink.......Yes, 42 years and two world wars after Thomas Mann sent Gustav von Aschenbach to Venice in search of beauty in the form of a young Polish boy, Wolgang Koeppen sends a whole German family to Rome. The Judejahns and Pfaffraths, linked by marriage and history, are not there for a family reunion. One of them is a pederast and a composer of a new symphony of dissonant music. He had made evident God's disquiet. The devil's work, so the literary debt continues.Dietrich thought he could detect some calculation in his brother's music, a conjuror's trick or a mathematical equation he couldn't quite solve; this music hadn't come to the composer in the way of the great and beautiful sounds of Beethoven and Wagner must have come to them, this music was manufactured, it was a sophisticated swindle, there was careful thought in these dissonances, and that bothered Dietrich.In attendance, under an assumed name, is Judejahns, an unrepentant Nazi. He is one step ahead of his Nuremberg judgement. Yet it is his wife, Eva, who serves as the blackest thought of the German soul.The number of characters and their fractured nature made this a much more complex and appealing read to me than  Death in Venice. Death will come; we know that. In Venice, a shocked and respectful world received the news of his decease. In Rome, when Death came, the fact of it can have shocked no one."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "But could I? Could I even cope with my own life? And then I thought: If Adolf and I can't cope with life, then we should at least unite against those unscrupulous people who want to rule because they are unimaginative, against the real Pfaffraths, the real Judejahns, the real Klingspors, and perhaps we could change Germany. But even as I was thinking that, it already seemed to me that Germany was past changing, that one could only change oneself, and everyone had to do that for him or herself, all alone, and I wished I was shot of Adolf. People remind each other of ghosts. Familial blood clots and colludes in the vein that threatens to burst over your strong brow. You are the amputated arm of country. It is like when you travel to another town and everything looks like home stepping in the same creaky floorboard. The big institutions of family like the same damned chain restaurants in every city. Power, military, church and the artistic soul in twenty-four hour lights. It is parades and it chimes doom or dinner bells. Time's road kill feasts.Gottlieb Judejahn tightens his butt cheeks as if he is going to omit a very big fart. He sits on the toilet throne of life, always on the verge of the silent and deadly void of judgement and hate. The former Nazi. The once upon a time an angry little boy looking for the ground to listen to him when he stomps out his mighty fears. What is he afraid of? He hates like the wheels a rat runs on in a cage. The image of his belt that raises his buttocks stuck with me. He feels like underwear sweat on a hot day. He gave me the creeps. I could see a mustache hovering in the air over fat and sweat and bulge. He is enormous in the mind's eye in this book. He is loud. Feel skinned and can't breathe when a man like this takes up all of the clean air to breathe with his murderer's foul mouth. He wasn't flushed down the toilet. He climbed back up and stunk up the middle east with power and demands. He's oozing through the pipes of the old city of Rome. It is old and there have been centuries of crap for him to fit right in. A man like Judejahn bides his time. A little boy like Gottlieb stamps his feet.His son Adolf was under the false sun of the hot lamps of family power. When the guns run out he opens his eyes like someone who doesn't know what they are seeing. He could be on another planet and there are no names for the starving Jewish boy from the concentration camp. No names for what they used to tell him in the training school. What does Father and Mother mean? There is a man he meets in a church. What does it mean to be a deacon now? You cannot forgive sins. This is what you can do. What does it mean to love? Forgiveness? It is a distance that is there. He walks the distance and I felt a blind mole rat in ancient city tunnels. I felt his no one is me no family. Father and son have a woman they see, Laura. Laura does not think. Laura cannot count. She works behind the counter in a gay bar. Laura senses intent, or is it interest, from the two men. She is a prize to be collected. Judejahn is all about getting between moist thighs. Flesh and sweat and moving. I squirmed to think of his organs squirming between their body parts. Laura's empty mind like a cow put me in mind of more meat and rutting. I felt nothing for them but saw again the mustache of the father and the clerical robes to hide what may or may not be underneath. What is a prize mean to me? She was a person. She should be a person. The men flow into brains on the page and I felt her no brain a lot. If a person can be a prize for someone else I felt why even bother.What would the nephew Siegfried, a musician, look like if he was not measured with a distance from a monster's face. If you were not looking for the same materials, to determine what sparked one to consume hell fires? What if death were not the answer but only how you wanted to live your life as it was then. Nothing to stand underneath. Nothing in the sky, nor in the past or answerable future. His father Friedrich is rising to power again, same as Judejahn. I was not surprised to read the introduction from translator Michael Hofmann explaining why Koeppen's books were not taken open arms by the German public. \"We don't need this at this time in our history.\" Writers who moved into exile were welcomed back and those who did not weren't. I thought about this a lot about why Stanislaw Lem moved back to Poland after exile during martial law. He couldn't make a living as a Polish writer anywhere else. Likewise, that was what Koeppen could do. There was no where else for him to go. In hindsight where could he have gone? The world was fucked up and doing fucked up things. If one does not want to name themselves from the people before them. I have seen photographs of the forced confrontations after the war. German women looked like they wanted to be anywhere else. They looked like cows. What had happened before didn't exist for them anymore. I had this feeling about the younger Adolf and Siegfried about their parents. Their mothers and fathers felt the tragedy was that the Nazis did not succeed. I felt the underneath and when they look up I see underneath a belly of death. I hear words about love, about forgiveness and family and I do not feel the meaning. They could feel the guilt, the collective guilt. Is it helpless to that, to own the human features that make those monster murderer faces and know that it isn't you? Would you have to get under the belly and carve into it, make it bleed, that you are not it? I felt the faces turning into the other face when their fists beat behind them for the world they live in. Judejahn who cannot wear his murderer's face. Adolf who wasn't born with a lover's face. Siegfried who should see music on his. There's another brother to Siegfried. He's the faceless of the masses who show the thoughtless rules of how it always is. It doesn't matter what you look like. This face will show what everyone else looks like. Look more like this and you will have the cruel faceless seas. I saw this face."}, {"userName": "Jonfaith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "userReview": "As a rule I attempt to distance my reviews from the personal. Certainly anecdotes thrive in this context. It is the more central experiences and principles which I make every effort to keep to myself. I'm afraid i can't do such this time. My friend J who I have worked with for 20 years died this past week. This has been one of the worst times of my adult life. I once went on a trip with J to Rome. It was around this time that I acquired this novel. For the life of me, I can't remember if it was before or after. My friend battled cancer twice in the last 20 years, this second time it was for keeps. This burning loss plagued my reading, tearing the book from hands after every ten or so pages. My wife has been wonderful throughout.Death in Rome is exactly that. Koeppen penned a vast German family postwar dynamic and then enkindled such in 200 dense pages of shifting points of view and acerbic images. The fact that such unfolds in the Eternal City affords it relief, a perspective, a historical resonance. The family broods and rebels on issues of guilt and accomplishment: culture and the Camps. The novel succeeds with its focus on hotels, the concert hall and a smoky gay bar. Hopefully more will witness this remarkable novel, an unblinking snapshot of the odd time in (West?) Germany between 1945 and the Fassbinder expressionism of the late 60s and early 70s.

And no matter how far you get away from them, they are never really that far behind. That's something that Siegfried Pfaffrath is unable to forget even for a minute, in this story about a \"family reunion\" of two pairs of German fathers and sons, in post-WWII Rome.I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but it surprised me in many ways: the prose is evocative and beautiful, but occasionally very convoluted, as most of the story is told as the inner monologue of Siegfried, his father Friedrich, his cousin Adolf, and Adolf's father - Gottlieb Judejahn.During the war, Judejahn was an SS officer, and the Reich's defeat is a bitter pill he still hasn't swallowed. He re-invented himself as an arms-dealer and is still boiling with hatred and rage. His brother-in-law Friedrich was a bureaucrat, and while he didn't have particularly strong feelings about the Reich, his actions led to many people's death and he doesn't really seemed to be bothered by that, even in the changed environment that is now West Berlin.Siegfried and Adolf are trying, in their own way, to atone for their fathers' sins; through music and through religion, respectively. Both of them are horrified by the events of the war and its consequences, and their inherited guilt pushes them as far as they can get from their families, but the old generation is not gone yet, and they are hot on their heels...Koeppen, who lived in Germany during the war, obviously pondered the question of German cultural identity very deeply. In this book, he takes four important facets of this identity (power, bureaucracy, art and faith) and through this family story, shows how interconnected those aspects of the culture are, and how impossible it is to separate them from each other.An intricate, chilling and very thought-provoking little book. 3 and a half star, rounded down because I doubt I'll be reading this one again. As interesting and well-written as it is, I can't say this was an especially pleasant read..."}, {"userName": "Lee Foust", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13984676-lee-foust", "userReview": "Another novel I read in order to write about it in my column in Florence News and Events and English-language monthly paper here in the boot.The Greatest Novel You\u2019ve Never Heard ofFirst published in 1954, German novelist and travel-writer Wolfgang Koeppen\u2019s Death in Rome is a little-known treasure well worth seeking out. I was drawn to it because of its Rome setting, as fodder for this column, but realized before I had finished reading the very first page that I had found something very, very special. Not only is Death in Rome a luscious and wonderful conjuring up of that Dolce Vita Rome of the post-war and pre-Beatles era, but it\u2019s also a fabulous flowering of Modernist prose techniques, hypnotizing in its streams of interior monologues, thought-based rhythmic repetitions, and musically minded meanderings. It\u2019s also one of the most convincing evocations, in a novel, of the dirty core of our Occidental political failings, that is to say of the slippery slope from national pride to patriotism, nationalism, imperialism, fascism, and finally the eventual pursuit of world domination and ethnic cleansing through genocide. It\u2019s rare that a novel impresses so convincingly in both form and content.Death in Rome\u2019s imaginative and organic style, its rhythms drawn from that inner monologue that we all carry around in our heads, takes us inside the thoughts, experiences, and desires of three protagonists whose particulars build them into representatives of their split, post-war German culture and, by extension, all modern nation states. They are: an artist, a soldier, and a seminary student. Evoking the historical moment, the soldier is JudeJahn, a former SS man who has escaped the Nuremburg comeuppances and finds himself in Rome to buy arms for the Middle Eastern nation he now serves as a soldier of fortune. He is in the twilight of his ascendancy, bloodstained, keeping the Fuhrer\u2019s dream alive in his every vile thought. His nephew Siegfried is an inverted romantic escapist, a composer of avant-garde classical music, in Rome for the debut of his first controversial symphony. His cousin, Judejahn\u2019s son Adolph, traumatized by the breakdown of fascism and the destruction of Hitler\u2019s Germany while he was still at school, is a seminary student looking to find another, better Fuhrer to serve in the Catholic priesthood. Siegfried\u2019s father and brother are also minor characters representing two generations of politicos who show us exactly what we all know, fear, and deny about politics: that it is more like prestidigitation or juggling than any ideological stance. They are mere opportunists, dancing to whoever fiddles them a momentarily credible tune.The novel\u2019s three colliding forces, the military, the artistic, and the spiritual collide both unbelievably and entertainingly through two days of criss-crossing encounters all throughout the exquisitely drawn Roman backdrop. You can palpably hear the fontanelle tumbling down water into the streets and smell the espresso and cornetti from the corner bars. The characters\u2019 encounters, dialogues, and the eventual death of the title (a nod to Thomas Mann\u2019s Death in Venice of course) meditate on the problems at the heart of the mid-century German drama and are certainly still relevant today: how do we negotiate and control systems constructed of power and born of conflicting beliefs? Who do we follow and why? And, most importantly\u2014and frightening here in the vivid portrayal of the interior mind of the former SS man\u2014where do these impulses to serve, to entertain (although there is much more to the portrayal of the artist here than merely that), and to dominate and destroy originate? I really can\u2019t recommend this novel enough, it\u2019s necessary food for thought."}, {"userName": "[P]", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40516522-p", "userReview": "I have a reputation in my family for being cold and difficult to be around. I don\u2019t, the consensus is, \u2018make any effort\u2019 with them. And that is true. I really don\u2019t. Don\u2019t get me wrong, family can be a wonderful thing, if it is a safe and strong and nurturing unit; but I realised at a very young age that the idea of being tied to a bunch of people you have nothing in common with, who are, moreover, unpleasant human beings, is absurd. Recently my mother has become involved with her sister again. This sister is, quite frankly, vile. I find the fact that she is back in my life very hard to take, but I find it even harder that she is back in my mother\u2019s, although of course my opinion is irrelevant. The only real blessing is that my Uncle is not around, having died of cancer some years ago. You are not meant to speak ill of the dead, but it\u2019s difficult when someone had almost no redeeming features. I was present at his funeral, when the eulogy was spoken. He liked cats we were told. And, yes, I guess he did, but he was also a violent criminal, with perverse sexual tendencies, who kept a gun behind his sofa.So I can identify with Seigfried Pfaffrath, one of the major players in Wolfgang Koeppen\u2019s Death in Rome. It is the 1950\u2019s, and he has essentially fled to Rome in order to escape his family, his past, and reinvent himself as a composer. But he finds that, in reality, you can\u2019t escape, because wherever you go you bring your experiences with you. Much of the novel is devoted to internal monologues, and even before he comes to understand that prominent members of his family are also in Rome Seigfried can think of little outside of his childhood, his hated Uncle Judejahn, his father, and the recently ended war. It is significant, I think, that he chose to become a musician, because we generally think of music as being an expression of the creator\u2019s inner life, their soul. Seigfried\u2019s music is described as being frightening, as \u2018naked and unworthy despair.\u2019 It especially unnerves Kurenberg\u2019s wife [the husband being a friend of Seigfried\u2019s] who grew up in the same area and whose father was eventually murdered by the Nazis.\u201cOnce upon a time, this city was a home to gods, now there\u2019s only Raphael in the Pantheon, a demigod, a darling of Apollo\u2019s, but the corpses that joined him later are a sorry bunch, a cardinal of dubious merit, a couple of monarchs and their purblind generals, high-flying civil servants, scholars that made it into the reference books, artists of academic distinction. Who gives a damn about them?\u201dThe Nazis, racism, and complicity all play important roles in Death in Rome. At one stage Seigfried dredges up the memory of Kurenberg asking for assistance from his father, in an attempt to save his own father-in-law. The advice that he received from Friedrich Pfaffrath, who at that time was a senior administrator, was to divorce his Jewish wife. A large part of Seigfried\u2019s anguish is related to his not wanting to be associated with his family\u2019s actions during the war and their ongoing Nazi sympathies. Like me, he feels tied to people who do not represent his feelings or opinions, whose behaviour he does not condone, people who, unfortunately, he will always be tied to by blood at least. He has, he states, thought about changing his name, so as to distance himself, but decided that to disappoint his family, who would not be in favour of his vocation, is a nice form of revenge; indeed, he focuses specifically on twelve tone music, which was frowned upon in his youth and was actually considered by the Nazis to be \u2018degenerate.\u2019 I found this aspect of the novel to be one of the most engaging; Koeppen did a fine job of capturing the young composer\u2019s understandable shame, disgust, and helplessness, in being related to murders and war criminals [although I would say that he borrowed liberally from William Faulkner\u2019s Absalom Absalom in order to achieve it].\u201cCould I even cope with my own life? And then I thought: If Adolf and I can\u2019t cope with life, then we should at least unite against those unscrupulous people who want to rule because they are unimaginative, against the real Pfaffraths, the real Judejahns, the real Klingspors, and perhaps we could change Germany. But even as I was thinking that, it already seemed to me that Germany was past changing, that one could only change oneself, and everyone had to do that for him or herself.\u201dThe most imposing member of the family and, as noted, the most hated by Seigfried, is Gottlieb Judejahn, a former SS officer. He fled Germany due to a death sentence having been placed upon him for his involvement in the war, during which he had ordered the execution, and had himself killed, numerous people. As with Seigfried, a large part of the novel is also given over to Judejahn\u2019s thoughts and feelings, and none of them are pleasant. He is an unrepentant Nazi and racist. He yearns for war, for bloodshed, for a reinvigorated, all-powerful and all-conquering Germany. In Guy de Muapassant\u2019s Bel Ami, Georges Duroy is described as having the attitude of \u2018an NCO let loose in a conquered land,\u2019 and I think this suits Judejahn perfectly. Men are to be beaten down or brought to heel, and women [whom he frequently refers to as \u2018cunt\u2019] are to be raped or fucked [if willing]. After spending some time with Judejahn not only did I empathise with Siegfried in his hatred, but I started to understand the title of the novel. Death in Rome. It doesn\u2019t mean dying in Rome, it means that Death has come to Rome, and his name is Judejahn, a man who stalks the pages of the book, and the city itself, like a particularly grim Grim Reaper.[Rome in the 1950\u2019s]However, as I progressed through the novel, I struggled to understand what exactly Koeppen was trying to say, specifically in relation to Judejahn. That SS men were psychopaths? Well, yeah. I mean, that\u2019s hardly news is it? Moreover, I felt as though Judejahn is simply too cartoonishly loathsome; I was, in fact, unable to take him seriously as a human being. Yes, he is a Nazi, but I\u2019m not convinced that he had to be so unrelentingly despicable, so much so that at times I expected him to tie a woman to some train tracks and stand to the side twirling his moustache. I am, of course, not defending the Nazis, but would simply have liked this one to be a little more nuanced as a character. Indeed, I don\u2019t actually think it is helpful to portray them as titanically evil [not to mention miserable], without a humane thought in their head or even the merest hint of sensitivity. That, for me, almost excuses them, as though we are saying that they are or were sub-human, or not human at all. They absolutely are and were human, they had families, friends, they laughed and enjoyed themselves. That is what is so horrifying about them. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the only example of Koeppen losing control of his material. I was also decidedly unimpressed with the melodramatic scene in which Adolf, Judejahn\u2019s son, kind of befriends a starving Jewish boy, and the two swap uniforms and break bread.In any case, I would laud Koeppen for his bravery in writing, and having published, a novel such as this so soon after the war, for reminding the world that Nazis didn\u2019t just stop being Nazis because Hitler lost; they didn\u2019t simply see the error of their ways, or \u2018wake up\u2019 as though coming out of a deep sleep. I think if the book says anything of note, anything really important, then that is it. People like Judejahn, who becomes a kind of Arab arms dealer, or Friedrich Pfaffrath, who becomes a legitimate mayor, may try and reinvent themselves, they may hide or escape, but their old prejudices remain. In this way, the stream of consciousness technique was entirely appropriate, because one might be able to wash the blood off one\u2019s hands, but one\u2019s thoughts, if we have access to them, would always reveal the true nature of the man."}, {"userName": "Friederike Knabe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746401-friederike-knabe", "userReview": "Wolfgang Koeppen's 'Death in Rome' is a profound and thought-provoking novel written in the mid-fifties. While set against the backdrop of Rome, the main theme is a portrayal of the early after-war German society. It is a remarkable book for several reasons. When first published, it was either criticized or, more commonly, ignored only to be praised a few years later by some of Germany's great authors such as Grass and Boll. Death in Rome was the third book of a trilogy, written by Koeppen in quick succession at the time - all addressing aspects of the \"new\" Germany. It was followed by 40 years of literary silence, except for travel writings and a short autobiography of his youth. Nevertheless, he is now regarded as one of the best German literary authors and his work has experienced a revival since his death in 1996.The members of one family meet, more or less by chance, in Rome. The protagonists each personify one aspect of German society: the military, the bureaucracy, religion and art. Koeppen weaves the complex story around an unrepentant former SS man, a then and now middle-level bureaucrat, a young priest and a young composer. The latter two being the sons of the older generation. Symbolism and mythology meet the reader everywhere. The links between Germany and Rome are multifaceted, reaching well back in time. The main characters' names were selected for their meanings: Judejahn for the SS man and Adolf for his priestly son. Siegfried, his young, gay composer cousin, explores experimental music that was forbidden during the Nazi period. He also befriends a conductor and his Jewish wife who had escaped the camps.There are different levels of connections between the different characters as they move in and out of focus of the story line. One is reminded of a ballet or a complicated but well-structured dance where each participant performs his or her part without seeing the overall picture that unfolds for the reader. Rome in its decaying beauty is treated almost like one of the characters in this composition. Koeppen underlines the intricate choreography by leading from one element in the story to another, often interrupting in the middle of a sentence only to complete it in a different scenario. The language also moves from factual detailed descriptions of events to intimate reflections and analysis of characters. For example, Judejahn is not all that he appears and his contradictions are explored through flash-backs to his youth. His wife Eva would rather see him as a dead hero of the past than as a survivor who is at odds with the present. In many ways, Siegfried represents the centre of the narrative and his voice alternates with that of the author. Still, he is not without his own demons. Both he and Adolf attempt to distance themselves, physically and mentally, from their parents and what they represent. However, given their upbringing, can they really escape?Death in Rome must have been an uncomfortable book for Koeppen's contemporaries who felt it easier to put the book aside than to confront the issues it exposed. Reading the novel today with the advantage of historical perspective, it has to be seen as one of the first successful efforts to critique German society as it emerged from the Nazi period. This novel is an engaging, if disturbing, read. I regret that I didn't know about this and the other books in the trilogy in my younger years. Still, Death in Rome is as powerful a book now as it was when it was first published and should be recommended to readers of all ages interested in recent European history."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "Totentanz\nWhy is this author almost unknown in this country? This novel from 1954 is a compact masterpiece, a lurid but fascinating dance of death that anatomizes the German psyche in the decade following the Second World War. Its setting is Rome in the early 1950s, evoked in a brilliant collage of sights, sounds, tastes and smells. Into this, with the choreographed contrivance of artistic licence, Koeppen brings together several members of a German family, scattered by hatred or exile since 1945. Chief among these is Judejahn (the name has overtones of \"Jew hunter\"), an ex-Nazi general and executant of the Final Solution, now training the armies of some Arab country under an assumed name. He is brought to Rome by his brother-in-law Friedrich Wilhelm Pfaffrath, a loyal functionary who once claimed that his position as Oberpresident of a province made the events of Kristallnacht none of his business, now denazified and elected Oberb\u00fcrgermeister by the citizens of his town. Pfaffrath believes that the conscience-laundering process can be applied to Judejahn also, not realizing the intensity of the other's continued devotion to the ideals of the old Third Reich.Set against these as representatives of the younger generation are their respective sons, who also happen to be in Rome at the same time. Judejahn's son Adolf, coming upon a stalled train of concentration camp inmates in the last days of the war, has suffered a crisis of conscience and is now in process of becoming a priest. His cousin Siegfried Pfaffrath is a composer, turning his back on German Romanticism to write in the new atonal style. The four men come together for the first time at the premiere of Siegfried's symphony, a scene that forms the dialectical climax of a book that has already screwed itself up to fever pitch and plumbed the depths of despair. Listening to the music, the deacon Adolf feels\u2026\u2026it was like a reflection of his childhood in a broken mirror. The Teutonic fort was in the music, the exercise grounds, the woods, sunrise and sunsets and dormitory dreams. But the cynicism and unbelief, the narcissistic flirtation with despair, and the drift into anarchy drove Adolf away.As in his earlier \nPigeons on the Grass\n (1951), which deals with the post-Hitler limbo in a German city under American occupation, Koeppen switches subjects and viewpoints almost paragraph by paragraph, now listening to Siegfried in the first person, now following him in the third, now breaking off to another character, or looking something outside the story altogether such as his wonderful reflection on the Pope at prayer. The effect is musical, but while the earlier novel was almost skittish and jazzlike, here the rhythms are slower, the connections tauter, the language cutting deeper. Originally separate, Koeppen's four figures (and several others beside them) circle one another in a tighening spiral, to come together in a climax of outward hatred and inner doubt. Keeping them separate for so long, Koeppen can show their private lives as clearly as their public personae, revealing everything from grandiose mania to crippling self-loathing, even in the same person. He can contrast their sexual proclivities: the confused yearning of Adolf, the pederasty of Siegfried, or the sadism of Judejahn. But it is by no means all inner monologue; a clear sequence of events generates increasing momentum over a couple of days. The climax, when it comes, may seem contrived, but the psychology is utterly convincing, etched in blood, bile, and acid.The brilliant translation by Michael Hoffman is a living thing, jumping from high art to slang, exalted and depraved by turns. Hoffman has also provided that rare thing: an introduction that can safely be read before the book itself and which greatly deepens one's appreciation of it. And renders my own comments derivative by comparison."}, {"userName": "Guido", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12281249-guido", "userReview": "Je hebt iemand als Peter Drehmanns nodig om geattendeerd te worden op een literair meesterwerk. Ik heb het over \u2018De dood in Rome\u2019 van Wolfgang Koeppen. Oorspronkelijk verschenen in 1954, uit het Duits vertaald en recent heruitgebracht door uitgeverij Cossee. Een kleine roman is het, althans in omvang (niet meer dan 194 pagina\u2019s lang), maar wie denkt dat je die op een paar dagen uit hebt vergist zich: als niet-Duitsers zijn we niet vertrouwd met het thema (Duitsers in het post-nazitijdperk), en er wordt een stoet aan personages opgevoerd (tien om precies te zijn, de meeste met familiale banden \u2013 het is sinds het lezen van Dostojewski geleden dat ik nog eens een namenlijstje heb aangelegd). Maar het is vooral de complexe en gefragmenteerde opbouw van het verhaal die van \u2018De dood in Rome\u2019 geen gemakkelijke lectuur maakt. Voeg daar aan toe: verrassende wendingen in de vertelperspectieven, uitgesponnen monologues int\u00e9rieurs, lange ritmische volzinnen, verwijzingen naar mythologie en musicologie,\u2026 en je begrijpt dat dit boek een inspanning van de lezer vraagt. Maar de optelsom van al die elementen is ronduit magistraal: een perfect uitgebalanceerde roman in een verbluffende stijl.Ik probeer het verhaal samen te vatten. \u2018De dood in Rome\u2019 speelt zich af, in een tijdsbestek van enkele dagen, in het Rome van de vroege jaren vijftig. Leden van een Duitse familie, door WOII van elkaar gescheiden geraakt, ontmoeten er elkaar. De protagonisten zijn de jonge componist en Sch\u00f6nberg-adept Siegfried Pfaffrath en zijn oom en antipode Gottlieb Judejahn, een voormalige SS-generaal die bij verstek ter dood is veroordeeld. Die Judejahn is intussen in dienst van een Arabische staat en is in Rome om een illegale wapenaankoop te regelen. Via de vader van Siegfried Pfaffrath, zijn zwager dus en ook nazi-sympathisant, hoopt hij zijn terugkeer naar Duitsland te kunnen regelen. Want zoveel is duidelijk: het Derde Rijk mag dan wel ingestort zijn (door \u2018verraad\u2019), de ideologie is nog springlevend. De oude generatie (de ouders van Pfaffrath, Judejahn en zijn vrouw) hoopt nog steeds op een restauratie van het nazisme. Het is de jongere generatie die radicaal breekt met dat gedachtengoed. De prijs die ze hiervoor betaalt is hoog: eenzaamheid, vertwijfeling, zoekend naar een nieuw houvast. Siegfried vlucht in zijn muziek (en pederastische escapades), zijn neef Adolf (!) zoekt soelaas in het geloof. Op \u00e9\u00e9n van zijn zwerftochten door Rome ontmoet de oude Judejahn in een bar Laura, een niet zo snuggere caissi\u00e8re. Judejahn denkt \u2013 ten onrechte - dat ze joods is, maar gaat toch met haar naar bed. Stomdronken, woest en \u2018in een rode nevel\u2019 wil hij \u2018die S\u00fcnde wider das Blut\u2019 wreken, eigenhandig zijn bijdrage tot de Endl\u00f6sung leveren. Moorden zal hij en doet hij, maar - de plotwending is verrassend en ingenieus - het is niet Laura die hij vermoordt\u2026Zo samengevat lijkt het niet bepaald wereldschokkend. Maar de reconstructie van die verhaallijn is natuurlijk te summier, laat een aantal minder prominente figuren onvermeld, zegt niets over de psychologische diepgang waarmee de protagonisten uitgewerkt worden, en al helemaal niets over Koeppens stilistische virtuositeit. Daarom een fragment (p. 188):\u201cZe had niet gedacht dat hij zo hartstochtelijk zou zijn, de mannen met wie ze naar bed ging voor de cadeautjes die een meisje zo nodig heeft waren anders niet zo opgewonden, het waren rustige affaires die zich in bed afspeelden, maar deze wierp zich op haar als een beest, hij duwde haar benen uit elkaar, trok aan haar huid en toen nam hij haar ruw, ging ruw met haar om en zij was toch zo smal en tenger, hij was zwaar, hij lag zwaar op haar lichaam dat zo licht was en zo goed om te omhelzen en zij dacht aan de flikkers, dacht aan de flikkers in de bar, aan hun weke gebaren, aan hun geurende haren, aan hun kleurige hemden en hun rinkelende armbanden en zij dacht misschien is het goed een flikker te zijn, misschien zou ik het ook moeten zijn, dit is walgelijk, hij stinkt naar zweet en hij stinkt als een bok, als een smerige gemene geitenbok in de stal stinkt hij, ze was als kind eens op het platteland geweest, ze was in Calabri\u00eb geweest, ze was toen bang en had heimwee naar Rome, naar haar heerlijke stad en het huis in Calabri\u00eb had gestonken en zij had moeten zien hoe de geiten naar de bok werden gebracht en op de brug had een jongen zich ontbloot en zij had de jongen moeten aanpakken, zij haatte de boeren en soms droomde ze van de bok en dan wilde ze de jongen pakken maar de jongen had horens en stootte haar en de horens braken af, in haar droom braken de horens af als rotte tanden, ze riep \u2018je doet me pijn\u2019 maar Judejahn verstond haar niet want ze riep het in het Italiaans en het deed er ook niet toe of hij haar verstond want het deed pijn maar het deed prettig pijn, ja, zij wilde nu de overgave, die oude man bevredigde haar, de veelbelovende vreemdeling openbaarde zich op onvermoede wijze, zij drukte zich tegen hem aan, dreef zijn opwinding op, stromen zweet liepen van de bok over haar lichaam, vloeiden over haar borst, verzamelden zich in de kleine kuil van haar buik, brandden een beetje maar brandden niet erg en de man was boos, hij fluisterde: \u2018Je bent een Jodin, je bent een Jodin\u2019 en zij verstond hem niet maar haar onderbewustzijn begreep hem, toen de Duitse soldaten in Rome waren had het woord een bepaalde betekenis en zij vroeg \u2018ebreo?\u2019 en hij fluisterde \u2018Hebree\u00ebr\u2019 en legde de handen om haar hals en zij riep \u2018no e poi no no, catt\u00f3lico\u2019 en het woord catt\u00f3lico scheen hem ook te ontvlammen in woede en begeerte en tenslotte was het hetzelfde, woede of begeerte, zij dreef weg en hij putte zich uit, rochelde en viel vermoeid, verslagen, als een dode van haar af.\u201dKoeppen is vaak zijn pessimisme (en erger) verweten. Hij mag dan intussen gerehabiliteerd zijn en door de literaire kritiek tot de grootste schrijvers van de Duitse naoorlogse generatie gerekend worden, een echt ruim lezerspubliek zoals G\u00fcnter Grass, Heinrich B\u00f6ll, etc. heeft hij nooit bereikt. Of deze nieuwe vertaling daarin verandering zal brengen valt te betwijfelen: op goodreads vind ik wel 209 ratings (gemiddeld aantal sterren: 3,9) en 36 reviews, maar geen enkele daarvan heeft betrekking heeft op de Nederlandse versie. Op andere sociale media (www.iedereenleest, Boats Against the Current): nauwelijks iets. Jammer! Want \u2018De dood in Rome\u2019 is een fantastisch sterk boek, een absolute ontdekking. Kende ik Duits, ik zou gelijk al zijn ander werk kopen.PS: Voor de ge\u00efnteresseerden: Hans-Ulrich Treichel schreef een boeiend en verhelderend nawoord bij \u2018De dood in Rome\u2019. Een uitgebreid essay over Koeppen is te vinden in De Gids van 1994 (jaargang 157) \u2013 auteur Wil Rouleaux."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james", "userReview": "Wolfgang Koeppen is one of the least well known literary giants of the twentieth century. While his output consists of only five novels they all are at least minor masterpieces and his final novel, Death in Rome, ranks as a major one. In this subtle and spare novel Koeppen creates a vision of the German postwar experience that is at once bleak and devastating. The four main characters of the novel meet in Rome and in small pieces of their thoughts and their lives the anxiety and sordidness of their world is laid bare for the reader. The death motif is perhaps the strongest from title through to the end of the book, but Koeppen also uses symbolism and unique metaphors, particularly animals and insects, to heighten the impact of his story. None of the characters are likable, but like a Kafka novel I found myself fascinated with them and the world inside their heads. Of particular interest to me was the use of music and the representation of the composer, Siegfried Pfaffrath, as a modern serial composer in the mold of Schoenberg. His music is described as like the \"degenerate art\" that the Nazis rejected while in its modernism it is not approved by the Catholic Church either. Some readers have made the comparison of the structure of the novel itself with a twelve tone musical composition. Perhaps--but whether the comparison is apt the novel certainly seems surrealistic, especially in the use of time in the movement and activities of the characters. I am impressed even more, as I reread it, with the way Koeppen uses every line and page to build the tension that explodes at the end of the novel. Death permeates this book in a way that few other novels rival. I think of Death in Venice, another twentieth century masterpiece, but Mann's enterprise is more Nietzschean than Koeppen's. While Tolstoy comes to mind also, in The Death of Ivan Ilych he seems a nineteenth-century precursor to the existentialism that would blossom a few decades later.No, Koeppen is more at home in the post-war dilemma of Europe and Germany in particular. And the world he depicts is brutal and dark. It is as if, at least for some of the characters, the war has not ended. This is particularly true of Gottlieb \"Gotz\" Judejahn who is at the center of the novel. Having disappeared he is tried in abstentia at Nuremberg and is effectively a ghost (as is his wife Eva) who haunts Germany, not directly but from a distance - in Rome. The other haunting theme mentioned above is the 'new' music of Siegfried Pfaffrath--best described as a latecomer to the atonal style whose priest was Arnold Schoenberg. Late in the novel Siegfried meditates on the nature of music:\"Music was an enigmatic construction to which there was no longer any access, or just a narrow gate that admits only a few people. Whoever sat inside couldn't communicate to those on the outside, and yet they felt that this enigmatic, invisible construction, built by magic formulae, was important to them.\"The structure of this novel and the thoughts of the characters, their communication or lack thereof, seems to mirror this image of music and its relation to those who hear and do not understand. Perhaps the only answer is to act out your lack of understanding--to end the dark, unbearable world with death.Overall the effect is impressive with the result being a novel that challenges the reader with its taut presence. I found the challenge invigorating and it encouraged further meditation on the ideas raised by the author."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Alaska)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska", "userReview": "I hardly know how to rate this. Can a book that has Death in the title be \"enjoyed\" 5 stars worth? I won't soon forget this, surely that qualifies it. Michael Hoffman, translator, says in his introduction: Death in Rome is the most devastating novel about the Germans that I have ever read, and one of the most arresting on any subject. It most certainly is a compelling read, both for content and for style. As to content, there are primarily four male individuals which make up a family - two each from the generation who were a part of the Third Reich and their sons. The sons reject their fathers, but the fathers believe they were right and that Germany will come back. I did not feel as if Koeppen so much colored their personalities with words of bias as he showed each of them for what they were and are. A word to the sensitive: one of the characters is a former SS general, very racist, and Koeppen depicts him as the brutal thug you can expect.As to style, I selected this read just now because Koeppen is one of those authors influenced by Marcel Proust, which was one of the tasks for the Fall Challenge. In a review earlier this month, I wrote of laying aside Nabokov for style and Proust for content. Koeppen blends the two perfectly. His prose is beautiful even with his often ugly and evil subject matter. No eight-page sentences - though some were long enough - but his cadence, often incorporating repetition, was perfect to my ear. I did not listen to this on audio, but having written that last sentence, I wonder how beautiful it might be to hear the language."}, {"userName": "Daniela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62181206-daniela", "userReview": "This book is like a punch in the stomach. I am not very well versed in post-war literature. All I have read is Heinrich Boll. But it seems to me, from the little I know, that Boll is far more subtle than Koeppen. Billiards at half past nine, the sole book by Boll I've read, is about the unsaid, what cannot be mentioned. Koeppen mentions everything. Everything is raw, crude and cruel. It's in your face. He wants you to know exactly what he thinks of modern Germany. Of what he thinks of the class that prospered both under Nazism and under the Federal German Republic. Of cowardice, of cruelty, of Death, of Justice, of the bareness of life after the Holocaust. There's no point to life, no point to music, art, religion, the State. There are just vain attempts to escape the past, to take refuge, temporarily, in things that are never able to make you forget.This is a pessimistic, shocking book; written to be shocking. Sometimes I feel Koeppen goes too far in his attempt to shock, in his attempt to show his disgust.

The present day events of the novel take place over a two day period, mostly at night. The four primary characters are Siegfried Pfaffrath, his father Friederich, his uncle Gottlieb Judejahn and Judejahn\u2019s son Adolf. The story is told in a mix of first person (Siegfried) and third person. But who are these characters, and what is the significance of their meeting? What role does Rome play in this story? Siegfried is an avant-garde composer, rebelling against his family and their traditions. He is in Rome for a performance of his work. Friederich, once a Nazi bureaucrat is now a respectable mayor. Judejahn, a former SS general, has been sentenced to death in absentia, and travels under a false identity. Judejahn has found a refuge in the army of an Arab state where he has easily exchanged being a Nazi for being a mercenary. Violence remains his primary driver. Judejahn\u2019s son Adolf is in training as a Catholic priest, but suffering a crisis of faith. In this novel, music, bureaucracy, arms and religion depict elements of the German soul. But distinctions between what might be good and bad within those elements cannot always be clear. Siegfried exclaims: 'In my daydreams and nightmares I see the Browns and the nationalist idiocy on the march again.' Yes, I can understand why this book was ignored or criticized at the time it was published.The interactions between members of this extended family, and their reactions to Rome, expose the extent to which they remain governed by the past. And not only their own individual pasts: each of the four elements (music, bureaucracy, arms and religion) has a past, as does Germany and Rome. Cultural collapse is a component of the novel but so, too, is the possibility of a different future. \u2018You\u2019ve outlived yourself, you\u2019re out of power.\u2019Wolfgang Koeppen (1906-1996) wrote three novels between 1951 and 1954. Death in Rome is the third of those novels, but the first that I have read. I\u2019ll be looking to read the other two. This is a powerful novel, one which I\u2019ll need to reread in order to appreciate it more fully. I wonder whether (and how) Wolfgang Koeppen\u2019s world view changed after writing this novel. Perhaps it became less bleak. Perhaps the younger generation (represented by Siegfried and Adolf) have exceeded expectations.

They are archetypes of German society and the German \"soul;\" the most repugnant, Gottlieb Judejahn, is a former SS general traveling under an assumed name, arranging arms deals for an army he is assembling in the desert. He misses the killing and wishes he could have done more to exterminate the Jews. His wife Eva is in permanent mourning (for Hitler and the death of the Reich). His brother Friedrich is a small-time town official, not as grotesque as Judejahn but still responsible for easing the way for Jews to die. Friedrich's son Siegfried is repulsed by the family patriarchs and has gone in the opposite direction, becoming a composer of vaguely discordant orchestral music. Judejahn's son Adolf has also undergone a conversion of sorts and is becoming a Catholic priest, to the disgust of his parents. Not much happens, in the present. Some family members arrange a picnic at Monte Cassino. Siegfried indulges his pederasty. They gather to hear the premiere of Siegfried's music at a concert hall. Judejahn drives around Rome in his giant car and lusts after women who are part Jewish. Dialogue is minimal. Description is thick and occasionally dreamlike, peppered with references to Greek and Teutonic mythology. Sentences and paragraphs are long; perspectives change. Siegfried is sometimes discussed in the third person, and sometimes slips into first person.He felt good, like a scorched wild boar, he thought to himself. He heard man sounds: water splashing, buckets clanging, whistling, oaths, jokes, orders, boots scraping, doors banging. He smelled the barracks smell compounded from detention, service, leather polish, gun grease, strong soap, sweet pomade, sour sweat, coffee, heated aluminum dishes and piss. It was the smell of fear, only Judejahn didn't know it: after all, he didn't know what fear was. He told himself so in front of the mirror; naked, thick-bellied, he stood in front of the fly-blown glass. He did up his belt. He was old school in this. The belt held in his paunch and hitched up his buttocks. An old general's trick. Judejahn went out into the passage. Men flattened themselves against the walls, dutiful shadows. He ignored them.

Written close to the event. Cousins whom their Nazi fathers have named Adolf and Siegfried, who spent childhood in Nazi facilities for the young, we meet now as an unconvinced Roman Catholic priest and an irresolute composer of modernist music, in rejection of their fathers and mothers (the introduction, by the translator, says women are scarcely present, that this Nazi clan is a male thing. But Adolf's mother was so wedded to the Reich that she goes about as its widow, explicitly). Both deacon -- he's not a priest yet -- and composer give glimmerings of hope, of escape, of another past alternate to the Nazi narrative of culture. Merely glimmerings; both might be utter failures. This is book three of the Trilogy of Failure. Siegfried's father works for the government, any government whatsoever, and is again installed in spite of his governmental crimes. Adolf's father was a murderer by trade and temperament, portrait of a Nazi driver, behind everything (as the introduction notes, he can't have been involved in every famous crime: it works as myth). He is the worst person in fiction, and although often seen from the inside, I agree with another reviewer who finds he verges on cartoon. Perhaps there is a point to that. Perhaps to make him human was impossible. To upset the Nazi parents more, Siegfried is also homosexual, although once he seems to say this is in order to upset the Nazi parents more. It is not a healthy lifestyle for him. The novel has a lot of sexual content, none healthy: the man whose name is Judejahn -- Jew with 'madness' or 'to weed out', says the introduction -- is illicitly attracted to miscegenation; there is plenty of exploration of the idea that Nazi-types are sexually compelling, although ours turns out to have a disgusting effect in the act. The n word is scattered throughout, as with the Third Reich's failure Jews and blacks make a cultural comeback in Rome.The only health is in two women, one Jewish, one suspected to be Jewish; Ilse who is a blessed rest in these pages (spoiler: you'll know not to get too attached), and Laura, bartend in a queer bar, whom the author seems to write contemptuously down most of the time but who emerges as a human portrait by the end. Modernist in style, it was an odd read to interrupt Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus with, as I did; Mann was blamed for being old-fashioned as a novelist, but I look forward to resumption of his more intellectual take on this subject.

It is perhaps allegorical to a fault, but its characters represent a Germany still inextricable from its (then recent) Nazi past. The four principals are foremost German \"types\": the unrepentant Nazi, Gottlieb Judejahn; his brother-in-law Friedrich Wilhelm Pfaffrath, the careerist who maneuvers to stay on the side that is winning; their respective sons Adolf Judejahn, on the verge of becoming a priest; and Siegfried Pfaffrath, a composer of what his uncle considers \"degenerate\" music. The four cross paths in Rome by chance. Judejahn's journey around Rome is narrated by his expectedly hate-filled interior monologue. He is the personification of a particularly German brand of evil: lustful, race-obsessed, death-glorifying. He is terrifying, but out of power he is also simply lost. His wife, Eva, who is as unreconstructed a Nazi as he is, in moments wishes he were dead, carried off to Valhalla, rather than defeated. He expects to obtain a job, possibly under an assumed identity, through connections with his brother-in-law. His son Adolf, who spent his childhood in a Nazi academy, has turned to religion after sharing a human moment with a Jewish boy, a concentration camp survivor, when the two encounter one another during a train wreck shortly before liberation. Siegfried meets with him in Rome; he believes Adolf's decision to become a priest is a cop-out, a knee-jerk reaction. He himself remembers a childhood terrorized by his uncle Judejahn. The names here, as the translator's note mentions, are no accident. The younger generation, embodied in Adolf and Siegfried, tries to make its separate and uneasy peace. Judejahn is haunted by the \"little Gottlieb\" who was in turn humiliated by his own father. The chickens are forever coming home to roost.The conflict among these archetypes of German-ness, which has been simmering throughout the novel (and which has pulled others, most notably the wealthy Kurenbergs, into its orbit) comes to a head as Judejahn and his son are both attracted to the same girl, named Laura, who works behind the counter at a gay bar. More prone to \"vegetative musing\" than thinking, Laura sparks the former's seemingly boundless reserve of murderous lust and serves as a source of temptation for the latter. Their inner demons are given a chance to come to the foreground, bringing Death in Rome to its inevitable conclusion. Largely ignored in its time in favor of a widespread voluntary amnesia on the part of many Germans, Death in Rome deserves exposure to a modern audience."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2463977-wendy", "userReview": "4.5 stars (I've bumped it up from the initial 4 because I can't stop thinking about it).Despite its short length, I expected this to be a slow, dense, rather difficult read. It is \"dense,\" I suppose, in the literary styling: free-flowing paragraphs, constantly-switching point of views, rich descriptions and devastating emotions (I kept thinking of Bruno Schulz in this regard, though his stories are quite different in nature and much more abstract). But ultimately I found this book to be neither slow nor difficult, and I read through it in 2 or 3 long sittings because I couldn't put it down.Wolfgang Koeppen pays homage to Thomas Mann in this novel's title, epigraph, and final lines, and perhaps the similarities don't end there. I know I need to go read more Mann before I can do justice to any worthy comparison here, but a certain grotesqueness jumps out at me in both Koeppen and Mann (and, well, most post-war German writers, go figure). Death in Rome is an odd, intertwining novel about two generations of a (very) dysfunctional German family. The older generation (an ex-SS officer and a public official) still cling to Third Reich ideology ten years after the fall of Berlin, and though unrepentant in their culpability for many horrors, are adapting to the new order. Meanwhile the younger generation--the unfortunately-named Siegfried and Adolf--have rebelled from their parents to write degenerate music and join the priesthood, respectively. They all accidentally meet up again in Rome while pursuing a variety of personal vices...and in the course of it, someone dies.But this plot is only a fraction of this novel's draw. The city of Rome itself is practically its own character come to life through the lush language, along with thousands of years of history that haunt the characters' every step. Apparently this novel was not very popular when it was published to German audiences, who must have found it far too uncomfortable back in the day, and Koeppen's work has only recently started finding a new audience since his death in 1996.

Published just nine years after the fall of the third Reich, it is a carefully considered examination of the \u201ccollective amnesia\u201d which enveloped the German people following the war and allowed them to forget their past, absolve their guilt, and move on with their lives.  We see this as it plays out in the lives of two families related by marriage, but estranged for many years by the war. For different reasons they find themselves in Rome at the same time, and through the conversations and experiences of different individuals, we gradually learn their stories and much about the German ethos.  The book captures the generational differences as we see the older members of the families living in the aftermath of the war: some in anger and bitterness hoping for a Nazi resurgence; others in denial and forgetfulness. In contrast, the younger generation lives in total rejection of the past separating themselves as far as possible from their parents whom they hold responsible. Adolf, the son of a brutal Nazi SS officer, is a seminarian in Rome studying to become a priest. His cousin, Siegfried, a composer of modern music, is in Rome where his latest composition is being performed. Siegfried\u2019s brother, Dietrich, preparing for a career in the civil service, is accompanying his parents on a visit to battle fields.  It is also a novel of ideas and character: ideas, because it examines the animating ideals of the time: socialism, communism, and capitalism and finds them all wanting including the ideals of religion; and character, because in their rejection of the ideals of the past, the young men discuss the fact that they have no convictions as they face the future.  Perversely, it is the older generation who, despite their complicity in reprehensible actions, leave the stronger impression, reminding me of the lines from Yeats, \u201cthe best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity.\u201d They may have been defeated, but Adolf\u2019s repulsive father and even his mother are convinced of the rightness of their cause and their future vindication. Crazed and hateful, they live in this certainty. In this book, perhaps Koeppen lifts the veil too soon on what many Germans were not yet ready to confront. I read it as a serious, profound, and provocative meditation on the meaning for all of us of a terrible time in history"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22509838-linda", "userReview": "Gottlieb Judejahn is een ter dood veroordeelde oorlogsmisdadiger die gevlucht is naar een Noordafrikaans land waar hij het leger opleidt. Zijn kleinburgerlijke schoonfamilie, de Pfaffraths, zijn met zijn vrouw in Rome en hij besluit uit de dood op te staan en hen te bezoeken. Wat volgt is een tocht door Rome, waarbij we dan weer de ene, dan weer de andere Judejahn of Pfaffrath volgen die allemaal op hun manier afrekenen met hun oorlogsverleden: * Zwager Pfaffrath is net zo gemakkelijk weer burgemeester geworden * Echtgenote Judejahn is nog steeds dezelfde rabiate nazi * Zoon Siegfried Pfaffrath is componist moderne muziek geworden (entarterter dan dat krijg je het niet) en valt bovendien op hele jonge jongens * Zoon Adolf Judejahn heeft het ene stramien/keurslijf ingewisseld voor het andere en is nu in opleiding tot priester * Generaal en oorlogsmisdadiger Judejahn zelf is nog steeds net zo gewetenloos en verknipt als vroeger en denkt voornamelijk in termen van tucht en doodslag. * Zoon Dietrich Pfaffrath vertegenwoordigt het nieuwe Duitsland als student die meer met geld verdienen en lol trappen bezig is dan met het verleden of cultuur.Wat volgt is een soort tocht door (een klein deel van) Rome waarbij de verschillende personages elkaar tegenkomen en weer uit elkaar gaan en in een \"flow of conciousness\" constructie zonder duidelijke overgangen tussen personen (die er trouwens in de gedrukte versie wel is). Je moet dus heel goed opletten wie je aan het volgen bent, maar als je dat doet krijg je een verhaal dat zeer de moeite waard is.Uit het nawoord maakte ik op dat bij het verschijnen van het boek in 1954 het meeste tumult ontstond rond de figuur van Siegfried de componist, omdat hij pederast is, wat met name in de DDR verkeerd viel tot ze doorkregen dat ze dat gegeven konden gebruiken om aan te tonen hoe verdorven het Westen was. Wat voor de hedendaagse lezer overblijft is een inktzwarte kijk op Duitsers na de oorlog, die vaak helemaal niet zo veranderd waren."}, {"userName": "Edwin Priest", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15654942-edwin-priest", "userReview": "Death is Rome is a little known, powerful masterpiece that evokes the ethos and pathos of post-WWII Germany in a brilliant and poignant piece of literature.On the surface we see a family reunion of sorts in post-war Rome. The four main characters come together in a swirling tango, describing in a social microcosm the complex angst and guilt of the four pillars of broken Germany: the military, seen in the stiff and disturbing character of the ex SS general Gotlieb Judejahn; the spiritual, seen in his rejected son, Adolf Judehahn, fleeing the horrors of the war by entering the Catholic priesthood; the political, represented by Friedrich Pfaffrath, an opportunistic bureaucrat who has served the fatherland by selfish self-advancement; and finally the artistic, seen in Friedrich\u2019s son, Siegfried, a composer whose debut avant-garde orchestral composition exemplifies his attempt to reject his past, yet clings and ultimately cannot escape it. These characters are rich, complex and deep, especially Judejahn, who, at least for me, will remain one of the more evocative and memorable literary characters I have come across.In this dance, the pride, the collective guilt and the held-onto prejudices of post-war Germany are splashed against the back drop of the heady dolce vitae atmosphere of Rome at the time. Koeppen\u2019s flowing, streaming and evocative writing style brilliantly captures the feel of all of this.This book is truly devastating and memorable and highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Jaap", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20520130-jaap", "userReview": "Interesting early literary study of the way Germans deal with their recent past. Stylistically very atypical of German mid-century literature in that it plays with long long sentences, with quick-fire sequences of thoughts, repetitions, sudden shifts of perspective (shifting from first-person to third-person), reminiscent of Joyce and such like. Using some covert historical hints, it can be established that the novel is set in early May 1954 (and was published in that same year, so it was fresh fresh fresh), it juxtaposes the thoughts and emotions of people from various positions under Nazi rule: fervent Nazis, those that stood by and let it happen, those that were raised by the \"system\" and then rejected it, those too young to have had a part but now looking at benefitting from the German economic miracle, and those that were victims. Language-wise, it isn't an easy novel to read, which was only partly caused by the typography used in my edition (those letters were awfully small and close together -- my poor old eyes). It deals with some very heavy topics, but it is in its own way still extremely relevant to the Germany of today."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115717-ryan", "userReview": "Koeppen seems to be somewhat forgotten ... or overlooked. I suppose you could call him a contemporary of Gunther Grass, though if I'm not mistaken his life reaches back a little further (to Wiemar) and terminates a little sooner.

You could call this an allegorical look into the German heart/soul/brain/body through the lives of a four related men - a bureaucrat, an artist, a priest, and a composer.

Qui convergono un ex generale delle SS, riparato in Medio Oriente sotto falso nome, la moglie, un\u2019esaltata Erinni nordica nostalgica del F\u00fchrer, e il cognato, zelante funzionario del Terzo Reich ora riciclatosi borgomastro nella Germania di Adenauer; qui si aggirano, in fuga dalla famiglia e da se stessi, i figli \u2013 un compositore di musica dodecafonica e un diacono \u2013 incalzati dalla necessit\u00e0 di espiare orrori che non furono loro a commettere. Con implacabile occhio critico Koeppen costruisce una storia che mette a nudo le tare segrete dello spirito tedesco, la pulsione di morte che si nasconde dietro ogni esaltazione mitica della potenza e che sfoci\u00f2 nelle apocalissi del Nazionalsocialismo. Ed \u00e8 grazie al suo distacco ironico e al suo vigile sguardo da moralista se nel mosaico dei personaggi e delle voci monologanti \u2013 cos\u00ec magistralmente ricreate \u2013 la figura classica del nazista massacratore non resta pi\u00f9 confinata entro i consueti schemi descrittivi di una personalit\u00e0 piccolo borghese e autoritaria, ma grandeggia sinistra. Il Dioniso nazista di Koeppen, che sprofonda via via nelle zone pi\u00f9 basse del grande ventre cittadino, da una parte manifesta una ripugnante vitalit\u00e0 e voracit\u00e0, una sadica e letale compresenza di desiderio e disgusto, dall\u2019altra \u00e8 un morituro, un disertore della vita e un baccante della morte, per dirla con Thomas Mann che in tal modo definiva il protagonista della Morte a Venezia \u2013 a cui Koeppen si richiama fin dal titolo.", "title": "La morte a Roma\n      \n          (Trilogy of Failure)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19539194-la-morte-a-roma", "average": 3.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1451581593l/19539194.jpg", "reviews": 47, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/54995.Wolfgang_Koeppen", "name": "Wolfgang Koeppen"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7576266.Letizia_Fuchs_Vidotto", "name": "Letizia Fuchs Vidotto"}], "type": ["Fiction", "European Literature", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19539194-la-morte-a-roma", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/752310.Death_in_Rome", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1770390.Death_in_Rome", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/901008.Death_in_Rome", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29964001-de-dood-in-rome", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2754559-der-tod-in-rom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1769233.Tauben_im_Gras", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/901009.The_Hothouse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/782831.A_Sad_Affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5149329-jugend", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2326518.Jakob_Littners_Aufzeichnungen_Aus_Einem_Erdloch"]}
