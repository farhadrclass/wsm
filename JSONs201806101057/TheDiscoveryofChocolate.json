I wasn't particularly fond of Diego from the start as he is young, selfish, and not that appealing. In fact, my favorite character turned out to be Pedro, his loyal greyhound. (I will never look at Hershey's kisses without thinking of Pedro). I do like time travel and I adore chocolate and learning about food history, so eventually the story kicked in more for me as Pedro finds himself living a very long life and wandering with Pedro from Mexico to Paris and then on to Vienna, England and America. While on his travels, Diego has brushes with many diverse historical figures such as Montezuma, the Marquis de Sade, Sigmund Freud, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, and Milton Hershey--which was entertaining and fun--although at times maybe a bit too much. Diego does grow some during his journey, but he never quite won me over completely. Besides Pedro, ;-) the food descriptions were my favorite part and the book is filled with them (see my Food Inspiration notes below). Overall, although I didn't love this book, I think if you are a foodie and a chocolate fan and don't mind a lot of fantasy in your historical fiction, it is an interesting and enjoyable read that will have you reaching for the nearest chocolate bar.

A Spanish conquistador falls in love with a Mexican girl, but circumstances drive them apart. When he leaves, she gives him a drink of enchanted chocolate which extends his life and slows his aging to allow him to return to her at a time when they can be together. Consequently, he wanders through time with Pedro, his greyhound companion, in search of chocolate and love. However, far more time and attention is given to the chocolate in this book. The descriptions of chocolate making, baking, experimenting and eating are rich and sensuous and instantly made me hungry. In fact, the food writing is what makes this book interesting to read.The remainder of the plot does not fare so well. The time travel element, surely an essential part of the plot, was made to seem almost incidental and there was no attempt to make it either logical or consistent. That the main character did not react with any surprise or disorientation to the completely unpredictable passage of time, and so it comes across as a lack of development on the part of the author rather than a deliberate device. The characters were mostly undeveloped, but this bothered me less than I expected as their appearances in the narrative were so fleeting. I did enjoy Diego's brushes with real historical figures, painfully contrived as they were, but they seemed an incidental rather than integral part of the story. Not enough was made of them, often they were unrelated to either love or chocolate, and so they did not really fit into the rest of the narrative. Ultimately, I suppose it's difficult to write an interesting account of a man who very rapidly finds his own life uninteresting and repetitive."}, {"userName": "Aunty Janet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4944998-aunty-janet", "userReview": "I found this a rich and intriguing book covering continents and centuries. Love, passion, and best of all, chocolate!''In 1518 the 20-year-old Diego leaves Seville bound for Mexico where he joins Cortes's conquistadors and falls in love with the beautiful Ignacia. When Diego is ordered back to Spain, Ignacia gives him a parting gift: a chocolate drink, the elixir of life, and the promise that \"If you are alive, then I am alive. Never cease in your search for me.\" But, returning to Mexico, he finds only her grave and so begins his wanderings, sometimes dictated by the forces of history, sometimes by his own whims. Through \"an eternity of travel\", he and Pedro reach Chiapas, the city of Ignacia's birth, where he discovers that time has slipped by a century. Full of incident made more piquant by the introduction of significant figures along the way, Diego soon finds himself locked in the Bastille. It's 1788 and he swaps chocolate recipes with the Marquis de Sade. Then on to Vienna to create sachertorte. Fervent with questions, yet filled with despair about life's meaning, he begins his weekly visits to Freud. And all the while, his droll scrapes punctuate his slightly overdone gloom. On board ship to America, Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas solace him with talk of love and food. The early 1900s find him once more in Mexico, a man old in wisdom, but still virile in his ways.''"}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8351613-ruth", "userReview": "A compelling read.

The author weaves his inventive tale around Diego de Godoy, a young Spaniard that finds himself attached as the notary to Cort\u00e9s as he begins his exploration and plunder of the New World. Diego has embarked on this journey to impress a young Spanish woman who is waiting for him to return with something new and worthy of her beauty and love, some treasure from the New World.Of course, Diego's discovered treasure is chocolate but he also finds true love with Ignacia, a native woman. This meeting leads him on his five hundred year journey.Runcie's premise is clever and I started out loving the book. The author began losing me a bit after the \"invention of Sachertorte.\" Then there was the tragic and ludicrous invention of the Hershey Kiss.Really?And the people he encounters along the way? Besides Cort\u00e9s, he meets the following (some a who's who of the chocolate industry): Marquis de Sade  Monsieur Debauve (of\u00a0Debauve and Gallais, the French Royally Appointed Chocolatier)  Franz Sacher, an Austrian confectionner  Sigmund Freud  Gustav Klimt  Anton Bruckner (I think.\u00a0 I couldn't pin point who the composer was that he and Claudia heard at the concert at St. Stephen's.)  Mr. Fry of J. S.\u00a0Fry\u00a0& Sons, Ltd.\u00a0 (a British\u00a0chocolate\u00a0company)  Milton S. Hershey  Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas I was anticipating that Pablo Escobar might make an appearance at the end of the book when he finds himself in a Mexican opium operation.I loved the first part of the book, was mildly amused during his time in France, became annoyed with the insipid conversations in Vienna (in fact, the dialogue reminded me of a boring French film), didn't really see the point of his time in England, and thought the Hershey Kiss wrap up was beyond absurd. But, then Runcie throws in Stein and Toklas and I had to wonder if he was actually writing a farce.\"A mousse is a mousse is a mousse.\""}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5274970-amy", "userReview": "This book would have been much better off as a novella featuring the love story between Diego and Ignacia. The first quarter and the last tenth of the book were the only parts that were worth reading. The part inbetween were mind numbingly boring and nonsensical.The main problem was this: the author wanted an immortal character and therefore introduced time travel, immortality and extremely slow aging (his pulse beats at 1/10 the speed of a normal person so he ages super slowly or something). I'm a huge science fiction fan, so I have no problem with any of these theories except that the cannot co-exist in the same story. Either he's immortal or he ages slowly. Either he lives long because of slow aging or he jumps through time of space. It can't be all of them! This is especially problematic since the time travel element was introduced early in the story, but the reason for the apparent time travel was never addressed (was it a time turner like Harry Potter? Stones like Outlander? A wardrobe like Narnia? A black hole like every sci-fi movie ever? WHAT WAS IT?!?) Then time travel is abandoned and slow aging is introduced (and that's fine too - all the vampire/werewolf/fearie stories prepare the reader for immortality)- it simply doesn't make sense to switch from one to the other and it irked me for the rest of the story.Plus the characters were rather boring and the bedroom scenes were just icky - I felt like I needed a shower afterward. Just gross.I feel like I'm being generous giving this book two stars.

There, amid the treachery and carnage, he discovers chocolate and the love of its supreme artisan, a woman he calls Ignacia. After a passionate retreat together, filled with chocolate- and love-making, they are separated by war -- but not before she tricks him into drinking an elixir of life. It's an elixir whose effects are stranger than merely conveying immortality, in fact, because his life seems thereafter to incorporate sudden slippages between one era and another, with intervening periods being spent at the same rate as the mortals with him he mingles. Needless to say, his intervals of ordinary history have a chocolatey theme, and he works with such luminaries of chocolate's tradition as Fry (in the UK) and Hershey (in the US; his opinion of Hershey's chocolate is much the same as mine, and in the book you'll find the technological reason for the judgement).

It was longer on Fantasy than it was factual information, and even some of the facts were way off. An example? According to the book, Mole poblano was \"invented\" by an indigenous woman in the early 1500s soon after the arrival of Cortez intead of the creation of the nuns in one of the convents in the city of Puebla 300 years later. The narrator reports seeing lemons and oranges in a market soon after the arrival of the Spanish -- history reports that citrus fruits were one of the plants carried to the new world by the spanish -- they were unknown in Mexico. Some of the Mexican historical events are a bit skewed -- which makes me wonder about the historical accuracy of other events, including the French revolution, et al.
