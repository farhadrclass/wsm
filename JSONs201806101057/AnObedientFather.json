Sharma does not shy away from the ugliest, most difficult subjects but writes about them so fluidly that you find yourself going along at a steady clip, jaw dropping wider and wider. Much like the subjects of abuse in this book, the reader at times can feel like he's in an abusive relationship he just can't pull away from. That's not meant to demean or minimize actual abuse victims suffer. It's only meant to highlight how deftly Sharma captures abuse of all kind (institutional, familial, cultural, structural) and grabs your attention with it.The portions of this book that deal with the machinations of corruption in India were less engaging in comparison to the personal stories. I say this as someone who is very interested (and relatively well informed) about Indian politics and Indian political history, especially post-Independence pre-globalized India. It seems it was hard for Sharma to turn his talents into the same success while talking about structural political and economic abuse as it was for him to talk about familial, personal abuse. With this and his newer novel Family Life, I've developed a strong sense of respect and admiration for Sharma. He is one of the sharpest writers writing today. He brings me great hope as a fellow Indian American man, that some parts of my life and my experience may be immortalized through his gaze."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Gender equality demands that I now read a series of novels about vile and depraved women, say, Isla She-Wolf of the SS or Myra Hindley or\u2026. well there must be some more. The list of novels about vile and depraved men is as long as the arm of a person with really long arms. And here is another. Well I should not complain, I knew the subject (father rapes daughter then 20 years later tries to abuse grand-daughter) already. But I had recently read Family Life, Akhil Sharma\u2019s excellent short novel about another type of personal catastrophe (severe brain damage). I hear Mr Sharma\u2019s next novel will be about getting your leg chewed off by a puma. Always look on the bright side of life, eh, Mr Sharma?This one really defeated me with its unremitting misery. It\u2019s not badly written at all. It\u2019s probably a very good book. But whereas when you are a young person skipping is an indication of light-hearted joy, in an adult reader skipping is a sign of heavy-hearted irritation, and I did find myself skipping like a hopscotch player on a burning pavement. I need a break from these ghastly men."}, {"userName": "Preeti", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2110092-preeti", "userReview": "I added this to my reading list ages ago and since I read Akhil Sharma's Family Life recently, I thought I might as well read this. And now that I have, I almost wish I hadn't.The story is disturbing, to say the least. The main character is an aging corrupt politician (corrupt politician - isn't that redundant in India?) who repeatedly committed a horrific crime (rape) against his daughter years ago for which he was never really punished. And the book goes into detail on that. To say it was difficult to read is an understatement.Somehow, as the story progresses, the author almost makes you feel bad for this monster, which is incredible. You catch yourself feeling these feelings, and then think, what the hell am I thinking?!The book also weaves in some major political events in India's history, which is an interesting angle. As bad as that is in itself, I guess it gives you a break from the above-mentioned sordid details.The effects of the man's crime on his daughter and then his granddaughter and the ripple effects this has just made this even more depressing. Especially in light of India's culture of \"what will people say\" and the effects on women. Ugh, this book is a tough read and not for the faint of heart.(I'm struggling with the rating because I think the book was well-written but the story itself...)"}, {"userName": "Dawn McCarthy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22720104-dawn-mccarthy", "userReview": "Despite this book's horrific subject manner, there was a bit of genius in the writing. While the reader is inside the head of the main character, who, to put it nicely, is a vile man, the reader both loathes and somehow can feel some pity for him, once all of his sins catch up with him. While reading this, you know everything he has done is reprehensible but, because you are reading it from his perspective, you almost feel sorry for him when he gets what he pretty much deserves. Getting the reader to feel this way is pretty remarkable. The author was able to keep this balance because he allowed us inside Ram's daughter's head as well (and allowing us to get out of Ram's head made it a bit easier to read). It is interesting to read the political and cultural piece to this as well. Sadly, it was interesting in a psychological aspect because it shows the reader why some families stay together, despite abuse this despicable and the result it can have on keeping the victim a victim and how that plays out with the next generation. The end tied it all together as well. It was a difficult book to read and phantom. If it weren't so well written, I am not sure if I could have finished. It is not for the weak of heart."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2341546-becky", "userReview": "This book is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It's written with a light hearted, conversational tone that belies the horrors underneath. On one level, the protagonist is a corrupt bureaucrat, given to betting on the wrong horse in political races and using other people's money to extricate himself from sticky situations. Despite the fact this part of the story covers some pretty major political events and a real time of turmoil in India's history, it's not this side of the book that really shocks. It's that our protagonist is also a rapist, who repeatedly subjected his young daughter to ever worsening advances. This revelation occurs once this daughter is forced to move in with him after the loss of her husband, and he finds himself attracted to his grand daughter. The \"logic\" behind his behaviour and the webs of deception woven around it are truly horrific, and all written in the bumbling, can't get anything right tone of the failed bureaucrat. It's horrible, sickening, yet someone numbed by the style. A real rollercoaster ride, and the kind that makes you feel ill after. Not the happy excited silly good kind of ill either."}, {"userName": "Kanika Sood", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6749043-kanika-sood", "userReview": "Reading this book is a test of morality. You may catch yourself holding your breath with Ram Karan as he embezzles election funds. You may also get annoyed with Anita, Ram Karan's elder daughter who was raped by her father at 12, for behaving irritably. Your heart may warm towards Ram Karan when he goes to secretly meet his grand daughter, Asha, who he unsuccessfully attempts to rape in the first chapter. As you go through the pages and the writer, time and again, brings you back to the flat that the three share, you may even find yourself waiting for Ram Karan to make a move.An Obedient father feels like a long book even though it is just 300 pages. It has countless scenes, several of which don't contribute to the plot but develop a character. The book has a distinctive narrative style, employing three three narrative voices: the second and the second last chapter are written in first person from Ram Karan's daughter's POV, the last chapter is in third person, and the rest of the book is narrated in first person by Ram Karan. It is a difficult book and even though I liked it, I am sure I will never want to read it again."}, {"userName": "Yves Gounin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5870668-yves-gounin", "userReview": "J'adore la litt\u00e9rature indienne.J'aime sa richesse, sa touffeur.

Each leads to the other. A long ago sin invades those who were involved, and causes complacency which engenders more sin. The cycle continues throughout the book.This is a book about family relationships, about politics, and most interestingly, about India as it transitions from its traditional self to a new world of money, business, and education. In some ways, the original sin was the British occupation of the country, which left the vestiges of its sin throughout Indian public life. Complacency has allowed this sin to grow, and graft and corruption are rampant.Mr. Karan is simply a man caught up in the predictable cycle, and his personal actions (and non actions) affect both his family and the public life of his country. Throughout the book, you'll wonder about Mr. Karan: is he a good man? Or is he simply a man who's life is entirely ringed with the flames of guilt, complacency, and obedience? Is he Everyman? Is the Western view of good and evil adequate for this one ordinary life?This is a brilliant novel, full of life's contradictions."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1321103-denise", "userReview": "This is not an easy book to review; nor is it easy to read. The main character, an overweight alcoholic, political crook and child molester, tells most of the story from his point of view. Although he is mostly a vile man, there are some times you forget yourself and feel some sympathy towards him. He molests his oldest daughter, Anita, when she was 12. Twenty years later, Anita is a widow with a young daughter of her own. She is forced to take her daughter and move in with her father, who she has grown to hate deeply. She is increasingly paranoid that he may attempt to molest her daughter. Amidst this story are stories of political corruption and intrigue that her father is involved in. I enjoy Indian fiction, and although this novel is a little crazy at times, I love Sharma's writing. His characters are so well drawn that I can practically picture them."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7281131-rebecca", "userReview": "A very kind bookcrosser (Edwardstreet) sent me this book after seeing it on my wishlist.Why I put this book on my wishlist, I have no idea, but after hearing the author Akhil Sharma on a podcast from The Ubud Writer's Festival I quickly dragged this off my bookshelf to read over the holidays.Having no idea what the book was about, and pulling it out of my beach bag to read last month on the sand I groaned audibly when I realised where the story was going. Generally not what I choose to read - especially on holidays.But, stuck a bookmark in this and continued to read once I got home. And, I am glad that I did. This book and it's author have won several awards and after reading this  review the structure of the story made more sense. Parts of the book had been published as short stories.The review is rather harsh, in my opinion and overall the story follows the members of a family after an heinous crime has been committed - repeatedly. Told in the first person I particularly preferred 'Anita's' passages, and did find myself flicking forward to see when the story would change voices again. The majority of the story is told by 'Ram', and in hindsight I would have liked a little less from him. The final passage is told in the third person, following 'Kusum' and this worked really well. While I would have tinkered with the perspective I disagree that it feels hurried, composed of a patchwork of brilliant moments strung together by an often lackluster story line. And isn't Akhil Sharma incredible? He deserves all those awards, and clearly he's worked hard as a writer and craftsman. According to wikipedia he's not only an investment banker, but has studied as a writer at both Princeton and Stanford. Wow! And some of the writers he studied under...!There are more then a few 'brilliant moments' and several times as a reader I marvelled at how as a writer he cleverly expressed little tid-bits that a Western reader perhaps would not be familiar with. There is a passage (which I cannot find now in the book, and wish I had read it as an e-book now - so much easier to search) where Ram is reading a holy book and a god instructs a man that he's responsible for his actions, but not the repercussions. A viewpoint and idea that I had not encountered before, but adds obviously to the story and highlights the differences between cultures.The ideas of cycles, rebirth, change, renewal, cleansing subtly sit on the page beside crimes, punishments, penances, and betrayal. Following 'Ram' through the story, following his ups and downs both within his family and at work it's clear that this unreliable protagonist is unbalanced. This, I found most believable, and was a credit to the author that as a reader I would keep reading about such a vile man and occasionally wondered if he could redeem himself and find peace.Such an incredible book. Being ignorant of modern Indian politics and history I did think about skipping some passages, but Akhil Sharma deftly guides the reader, showing the political parties, the bureaucracy, the socially accepted corruption and religious tensions as aspects of the overall story, placing the story firmly in a certain time and place. Was 'Ram' a product of his generation?Returning to the NYTimes review, the bi-line reads: A first novel focuses on an Indian bureaucrat whose life follows the path of least resistance. Personally, I don't agree with this seeing 'Ram' actively making decisions and shaping his own life and that of his family. This is a novel I will be thinking about for some time. Akhil Sharma's new novel is just out and made The New Yorker's 'Top 10 books for 2014. In a recent New Yorker article he spoke about the difficulties of writing his second novel and how it took him 12 years. I have no doubt that this too will be an incredible read, and will add it to my wishlist also.Thank you again Edwardstreet."}, {"userName": "Siv30", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2015", "userURL":

This makes sense: Sharma gives us a corrupt, alcoholic, child-molesting bureaucrat as the vehicle through which most of the story is told. And\u2014call me old fashioned\u2014this makes the story just that much harder to get through; any time you have a protagonist so wretched, so miserable, so abhorrent that you are viscerally\u2014even physically\u2014angered by them... Well, good luck finishing; you're unlikely to enjoy the story.So where does that leave us? Is this worth reading? Yes, perhaps.The catch is that there is a fine line between what's gratuitous and what is simply graphic. Fortunately, Sharma gets all (or at least most) of this out of the way in the first 50 pages or so. But you may find that you need a strong stomach to get through those first 3 or so chapters. That said, if it weren't for chapter 2 {\u2020}, I might have abandoned it.At the heart of this story is a tale of the consequences that follow corruption and moral ambiguity. It is gripping and powerful at moments but kind of shambling and listless at others.---\u2020 = Sadly (and confusingly) one of only two where the first-person narrator is not Ram; and that final dangling chapter in the third-person... how does that fit in?"}, {"userName": "Steuart Osha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14251749-steuart-osha", "userReview": "How the narrator notices himself enjoying swinging his arms, or considering telling little lies, or, with the same candor, drinking compulsively, or committing the grossest meanness, is funny, and then devastating. Ram's efforts at redemption towards the end of the story are accomplished by way of his own degradation at the hands of his increasingly unhinged daughter--a perverse catharsis that never vindicates her. The outer-tier story of vocational corruption and betrayal, is dense, and harder to follow, reminding me both of the political hypocrisy in the French satire \"Submission\" (2015) and also of \"The White Tiger\", which is like \"An Obedient Father\" on steroids.The writing is astute, concrete, funny and sensitive to systemic injuries to women at the hands of an archaic, impoverished society, although its core is something to do with the corruption of everyone where morality is absent."}, {"userName": "Helen Mallon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7511723-helen-mallon", "userReview": "I wish I could give this book five stars and one star, simultaneously.

He is a 'money man' for corrupt political figures, collecting and distributing bribery money that greases the wheels of what passes for democracy in India.He is a widower, with a heart condition, and his daughter Anita, who is a widow, and her young daughter, Asha, live in a flat with the man they call Pitaji, as they cannot afford to live elsewhere.This is a household full of tension and distrust, of shame and anger and revenge, where family relationships are barely held together by a fragile thread.Because, Pitaji, when still married, raped and molested his young daughter Anita repeatedly until he was caught.Anita, understandably, cannot forget or forgive what was done to her in her childhood, and her fear that her father may commit similar crimes with his grand-daughter Asha is constant and palpable.Some of the chapters in the novel are narrated from the perspective of Pitaji (Ram), and are full of self-loathing, shame and promises to reform, and yet occasionally revert to periods of self-justification, victim-hood and some doubtful conviction that he is a reformed and trustworthy man.Other chapters, told from Anita's perspective, contain tension, distrust, anger and revenge and, ultimately, a destructive path where reason and control are overtaken by irrationality.There are other family members with small roles in the story, none of them particularly likeable, and a complete rogue's gallery of corrupt politicians and officials from both the Congress and BJP parties.Despite the fact that Sharma now lives in the US, this is a quintessentially Indian novel. and the author has captured the culture, language, family relationships, prejudices and superstitions, along with the nature of local politics, impeccably.None of the characters are particularly endearing - even Anita, the primary victim of the tale, manages to diminish some of the sympathy that may have been her due by her vindictive and uncontrolled actions.

Ram Karan, the protagonist and primary narrator, is an inspector for the corrupt Delhi school system. For all intents and purposes, he is a bribe-collector, although not a particularly good one. \"My panic in negotiations was so apparent,\" he explains, \"that even people who were eager to bribe me became resentful.\" Anxious and overweight, recently widowed, he is driven by fear rather than political convictions. The Congress Party sustains him, but when Rajiv Gandhi is assassinated, Karan finds himself caught precariously between the party and the rising Bharatiya Janata Party. If he switches parties, and the BJP loses the election, he will be attacked by Congress and tried on corruption charges. If he doesn't switch parties, he will lose his job.This decision is complicated by the drama of his home life. Karan shares his apartment with his daughter Anita, whose husband has just died, and their relationship is far from civil. \"My mind was adept at reducing its presence,\" he admits, \"when my body did something shameful.\" In the past, his body has often been beyond his control. When Anita was a girl, he raped her repeatedly and now 20 years later he begins to find the presence of her 12-year-old daughter Asha extremely provocative.Anita notices this attraction and brings her memories into the open, using them to demand money and other concessions from her father. The bribes Karan pays Anita mount as he, now working for the BJP, begins selling the very land out from under schools, and filters the money back to the party for election funding. He believes in nothing but his own preservation and even seeks to bribe both parties to protect himself.An Obedient Father chronicles these personal and political dramas and their intersections. While both storylines are engrossing, neither is particularly encouraging or uplifting. It is the subtlety of Sharma's prose that makes the novel so compelling and so readable. For example, here is Karan describing his own appearance: \"I wore a blue shirt that stretched so tight across my stomach that the spaces between the buttons were puckered open like small hungry mouths.\" In a book that concerns itself with unnatural, unhealthy appetites, even inanimate objects speak of dissolution.Ram Karan is a monstrous character, in both his public and private life, yet he is so carefully depicted that his motivations and emotions are perfectly understood. If he cannot be sympathetic, he is very nearly so. His narrative dominates the novel, imbuing it with his anxiety and helplessness; his guilt is palpable, as is his desire to change or at least control his behavior. Part of the reason he is unable to realize a change, or draw nearer to happiness, is the lack of forgiveness that Anita shows him. In the sections she narrates, she reveals herself as a somewhat sinister, scarred figure whose only desire is to free herself by tormenting her father. The depth of her hatred and the extent of her revenge are chilling and utterly believable.An Obedient Father may be too dark for some readers; however, its power is undeniable, and its story fascinating. At its close, the remaining characters are left with the effects of terrible causes, and the hope that the future may bring, with its knowledge of the past, less destructive actions. \u0097Peter RockPeter Rock is the author of the novels Carnival Wolves and This Is the Place.
