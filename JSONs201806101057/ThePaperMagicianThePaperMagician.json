And even if there\u2019s no door to freedom, at least you know you tried. One more, Ceony.\u201d\nThis was a good book. At the beginning, I was getting solid heavy magical Daddy Long Legs feels...which descended solidly into Dickensian feels, more specifically, A Christmas Carol. Then it became nigh unbearable, because constant flashbacks are not for me, no, sir. Excellent premise. A heroine that I liked. It was just a shame that this turned out to be such a boring book for the latter 2/3s.The good: light on the romance, the heroine is genuinely likeable, no Mary Sues here, the main character gave me heavy Snape feels (without the greasy hair), and the romance...oh, so very light.Not to mention I seriously want to take up origami now.The Summary:\nEvery window in the mansion\u2014and Ceony counted only seven\u2014hid behind black shutters all chained and locked, without the slightest glimmer of candlelight behind them. Dead leaves from a dozen past winters clogged the eaves and wedged themselves under bent and warped shingles\u2014also black\u2014and something drip-drip-dripped nearby, smelling like vinegar and sweat.The tiles composing the path up to the front door, which hung only by its top hinge, were cracked into pieces and overturned, and Ceony didn\u2019t trust a single one of the porch\u2019s gray, weathered boards to hold her weight long enough for her to ring the bell.\u201cI\u2019ve been shot to hell,\u201d Ceony murmured.\nA most inauspicious beginning to young magician Ceony's apprenticeship. In this alternate reality of England, there exists magic. There exists magicians. Each magician, once graduated, is assigned a speciality.Ceony has been given paper, or as they call it, folding.\nHer heart had broken at those words, and now, standing before the gate of Magician Emery Thane\u2019s lair, she wished it had stopped beating altogether.Mg. Aviosky obviously did not realize that the reason Folding had become a dying art was because the skills it enabled were so completely useless.\nPaper. The seemingly most useless of all the magical arts. What can you possibly do with paper?And what's worse...Ceony is sent off into the backwaters of England, into a dank, dingy old home...\nA skeleton greeted her.The eyeless head of the skeleton looked up and down almost mechanically, and Ceony, with a hand over her heart, realized all six feet of it was comprised of paper\u2014its head, its spine, its ribs, its legs. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of pieces of paper, all white, rolled and Folded and pinched together to connect in a variety of joints.\nIf this is the reception, what could the owner possibly be like?\n\u201cHe\u2019s mad,\u201d Ceony said, aloud this time.\nWell, not really. Magister Thane is quite average. Really.\nHe seemed quite average, his skin neither light nor dark, his height neither short nor tall, and his build neither thin nor broad. His dark hair fell just below his ears in a sort of kempt-but-unkempt way. He had black sideburns down to his jaw, and his nose had a slight bump to it, just above the middle of the bridge. The only thing extraordinary about him was the brightness of his eyes\u2014green as summer leaves and shining as if someone had hid a light behind his forehead.\nMagister Thane may not be mad, but he is immensely eccentric, as we readers love for our magicians living in the wilds of England to be. His magic lies in paper, and his entire house is decked out in paper.And like any bachelor magician, he doesn't know how to cook, and he doesn't have two beans in his cabinet. Try as she might, Ceony can't help but pity the guy, but there is no doubt to the fact that he is brilliant at what he does. Ceony wanted a teacher, she's got one.\nHis hands stilled, revealing a stout fish between them, puffed out in the middle to form a three-dimensional body. Folds similar to the orange bird\u2019s wings formed its pectoral fins. Mg. Thane picked it up, whispered to it, and released it. The fish soared upward through the air as a real fish would in water, its tail fin paddling back and forth until it hit the ceiling\u2014which Ceony noticed had been covered with long pieces of white paper tied together with a simple string. The white fish used its puckering mouth to bite down on the string and untie its looping knot.\nAnd like any good, mysterious magician...he's got something to hide.\nShe lowered the fortuity box and narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cWho\u2019s Lira?\u201dMg. Thane\u2019s expression did not waver, nor did his stance, but for a moment Ceony could have sworn his eyes flickered dark and back. Only . . . no, they weren\u2019t quite as bright as before. Perhaps it was the late-growing sun outside the library window, but she didn\u2019t think so.\nLife is quiet. There is a lot to learn, and Ceony's days are consumed with books...and cleaning. It is a terribly old house, after all. It is a peaceful existence until the day that woman shows up and does something unthinkable. In a single moment, Ceony's world is overturned...and she has two choices. Run away, or face what she fears, despite her greenness, despite her status as an amateur folder. Does Ceony stand a single chance against one who is so much stronger, one who works the dark art of Excision? She must.\nThe snowflake still felt frosty, just like real snow. Snow he had made for her. All of it had been for her in one way or another, hadn\u2019t it?In the glow of the candlelight she said, \u201cI have to do it. I have to save him.\u201dFor she knew no one else would.\nCeony: \nCeony had the feeling that, should she get to the buggy with Mg. Aviosky now, she\u2019d run away and never come back. And, though she despised it, Ceony knew she needed to wait for her new responsibility to settle before she could trust herself near any easy exits. She had bound herself to paper indefinitely, and it did her no good to push through a year at Tagis Praff just to throw it all away now.\nCeony is a very likeable, approachable character. She is not overtly feminine. She is intelligent...she had to have been, to have graduated from her school so quickly, at the top of her class, but that doesn't mean she is 100% mature. Quite the contrary at times.\n\u201cWell, the absence is rude, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ceony asked, hating how childish the words sounded in her mouth. She cleared her throat and sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a little on edge.\u201d\nShe has a rather grim sense of humor, but above all else, Ceony has practicality. She didn't get the fate she chose, but she never dwells upon the unfairness of it. She makes the best of her circumstances.\nCeony couldn\u2019t bond paper and still hope to be a Smelter, enchanting jewelry and bespelling bullets as she had often daydreamed during her lessons.It wasn\u2019t fair, but there was no use in further complaining.\nShe is brave, but never a martyr.Final comments: It was a solid book, but besides the fact that I found it dull, this book was missing a lot of spark, a lot of soul. I liked all the characters. The love interest was sweet, and there was very, very little romance. This book just lacked that special quality that made the things and the characters within it come to life within my imagination."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "This book was sweet and magical \ud83d\ude0aCeony was hoping to apprentice to become a smelter or chef, but Tagis Praff School for the Magically Inclined had something different in mind when they set her up with Mg.

The magical system in the book and series, is very unique as magicians bond to certain man-made materials like paper, glass, steel, etc... and once bonded they can use them. For example the main protagonist, Ceony can make a paper bird and it will then \"come to life\" and she can use it to scout for danger or find a person.The setting is England around Victorian times, but doesn't have that \"woman can't do [fill in the blank]\" vibe. Ceony is very likable and the story took an unexpected turn, going in a direction I didn't predict (a good thing!). There were just a few places where my suspension of disbelief was stretched, but minor quibbles all. I enjoyed the interaction between Ceony and Emrey--another character who I liked just as much.This book made me look at paper in an entirely different light! :)"}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3530786-caroline", "userReview": "This book honestly has A LOT of promise. The writing isn't bad, even if there were many times I didn't feel the author was true to time period or location. The subject matter was interesting and I liked the idea of the world of magic being split this way, bonding to a specific medium. It was also interesting that the world of magic was generally an accepted part of life in this realm of reality. But there were some big flaws I couldn't overlook, including a desperately dragging second half that felt as though it were written as a plea for a screen play rather than a novel. **SPOILERS BELOW**However, what started out as a promising, fascinating book devolved for me when the second half of the book was spent nearly entirely in visions that didn't even belong to the lead character. I didn't understand the logic of bringing the dog on the rescue journey. I think this would have been more powerful or useful to me if this segment of the book had been no more than a third of the book, either with more descriptions of magical life and relationship development in the beginning, or application of the lessons and visions from inside the heart and on the journey to life after the adventure. All in all, there was just way too much time spent on the section in the heart and everything that followed felt rushed, cliched, and predicable in a way that did not utilize effectively anything I'd learned in the trudge through the rescue. I spent the whole second half wishing the book would just move on and get back to the story."}, {"userName": "Doug Warren", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2135772-doug-warren", "userReview": "A note before I start the review. If the author ever happens to read this, or anyone considering writing a book based in a different time or place--just saying it is set in England at the turn of the 20th Century doesn't make it so. It is very hard to get into it when everything sounds like modern day language and dialogue. It sounds exactly how people speak today. Even when the story told me the year and the place, I had a hard time feeling it. Read D. H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers. That's how this book needs to feel. That's how the dialogue needs to sound. If not, your book will never be believable. Honestly, if this book had been set in present day America, and had a lot of the unneeded details and adjectives cut out, it would have been better. Would have definitely garnered more stars than me. But as it is, well, you'll see my opinion in my review. My apologies up front, because I'm going to be a bit of a jerk. Now, on to the review:Boooooooo! Booooooooooo! I don't think I have ever booed a book in a review before, but this one was more than deserving. I've had Amazon Prime for a while, but August was the first month I remembered to get one of the free ebooks, and boy, I can tell ya, what a let down. I mean, wow, the author sure can put a lot of words on paper without saying anything. And some of her similes and metaphors are just laughable--unnecessary and distracting. And I guess this book is set in England...because everyone once in a while it has some attempt at using an English term, word or colloquialism, but since it is not constant, it just makes it awkward. So, prediction 1-this author is American, and probably had never visited the UK. Prediction 2-she was homeschooled as a child, or grew up Mormon, or something else that keeps you out of the real world, shelters you...something. I mean, is undergarments too big of a swear word to say that we have to call them underthings...And the book is about magicians, and she makes note of one of them noticing the other didn't pray before a meal...well, pretty sure in any realm practicing sorcerers aren't Christians (or followers any other Abrahamic religion)...so they wouldn't pray before a meal, right? And, I mean who else besides a right-winged American would describe an English girl right out of school traveling with a gun in her suitcase? (When I wrote this I hadn't figure out it was set around 1900 yet. Now it makes more sense, but come on! A reader shouldn't be surprised by the year come page 60 or so!) But she describes currency as pounds, so it has to be the UK, right? But the whole ambiance of the book is American. You can't just say a few British words and phrases and call it good. Just like how saying you saw a yearbook from 1888 doesn't all of a sudden make the book feel like it's taking place 100 years ago. That's not how setting works. And I get it, I know, I know, I am not the target demographic for this book. But having been a language arts and reading teacher the past five years, I know there is good stuff out for preteens/young adults. There is quality work. To put this book out and give it to them because they might enjoy it because they don't know any better is insulting. I have read books that were boring, but I could appreciate and give a good review because of the mastery of the word play. And then there are books that I absolutely love with zero literary value, but they are just so darn entertaining. But this book had no redeeming qualities. I hate this book more than Roger Ebert hated any of Rob Schneider's movies. Even with the review as it is so far, I think I am painting it in more of a positive light than I really feel it deserves. I would rather hold in a really uncomfortable fart for 3 hours in a room full of people I look up to and respect and would be humiliated if I embarrassed myself in front of them than have to spend 3 hours reading this steaming pile again. I mean, I have read owners' manuals for lawn mowers that were more entertaining than this. I have read a lot of self published books, and of course they are amateurish; they are amateur books! But this one looks like it is coming from a real publisher, and it is more amateur and poorly written than anything self published, barring the worst of the worst. The only thing this book has going for it over self published stuff is it seems to be free of typos. So yay for the proof reading! BUT! When you were proof reading, for the love of Vishnu why didn't you revise it!?! It's like my 4th graders in class. When I tell them it's time to edit and revise, oh they do the editing well, putting in periods and commas and making sure everything that needs to be capitalized is, but the revising is where they get messed up. They are married to their work and don't want to erase anything. So when there is crap, instead of taking it out, they pile more crap on top of if. And then they get a steaming pile of crap. Like The Paper Magician. The more I read the worse it got. She went up stairs and smelled mildew and it was cooler than down stairs. Before there was air conditioning? That's not how attics work. That's how basements work! This is why you need to proofread for more than just punctuation and grammar mistakes! Oh. To any future readers of this book-- once you get to the \"exciting\" part where she is in that thing (don't want to say what for spoilers sake, but it's the main thing you aren't going to miss it) skip to the last chapter. Yep. It's horribly boring and takes way too long to say what is happening, but in the last chapter she gives an abridged version of what happened in a conversation. So yeah. Those tedious chapters were all a waste because you find out what happened without them. In other words, don't buy this book. Don't read it. The only reason I read it all is because after the first few pages I knew I had to write this review, and I wanted it to be as honest as possible. If the book had just one redeeming quality, I would have told you. But it didn't. I have never hated a book as much as this one. Booooooooo! Booooooooooooo!"}, {"userName": "rubywednesday", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5896025-rubywednesday", "userReview": "I was trying to think of what was wrong with this book and the only thing I could come up with is that is too wishy-washy. When all the details, from the magic rules to the setting to the time to the characterisation, are as so vague it's impossible to get invested in a book.First up, the positives. The imagery was pretty and impressive. The first third or so of the book had all these cool paper things coming to life and it was so nice. It had a similar quality to The Night Circus. It had the guts of a good concept and I was intrigued at first. Um, that's all I've got. The rest sucked.First of all, when was this book set? Someone please tell me because the text sure didn't make it clear. It seemed to be some alternate version of London in the early part of the last century. Plastic's been available for thirty years. They ride in buggies. They dress in older. idek. Culturally, other than a mention of the Thames, it didn't resembled any London I'm familiar with. Makeup was only recently popular, too. The main character was bratty and then silly and then just blah. You can tell the author was really trying to make her independent and strong. That was cool, I guess. She was always cooking for the guy. Like at least fifty meals were described. At least forty nine of them didn't fit with what people of their apparent class/background would be eating in the past. Rice and pasta and even sausage gravy and biscuits (!!) were not on the menu then. She was meant to be an apprentice but she spent more time doing her boss/future love interests laundry and cooking. yay! feminism! The romance here represented a particular kind of relationship that you see a lot in certain books and I was super uncomfortable with it. So, she was only 19 and she developed a crush on her boss/master. It seemed to be her first time even spending time with a guy tbh. As the book progresses, they fall in love in about two days, she still cooks and cleans, risks her life to save him from his evil ex wife, and sees a vision where they will grow old together and have kids. Oh, we also find out he saw her working at an event when she was much younger and decided to fund her magic education. So every aspect of her life revolves around him. I mean, that's just so creepy and paternalistic and ugh. The plot was lame. The rescue wasn't nearly as exciting as you would think. it involved literally wandering around his stolen heart. yeahI guess this is meant to be a YA book. Even though the main characters are 19 and 30ish. It reads young and not in a good way.

You can only magically bond with one material and after your bonding ceremony that material is the only one you can work. Ceony, a scholarship student with a perfect memory, is assigned to paper. An ignoble and unglamorous specialty. Her teacher is strange and possibly mad. What a great premise! A victorian- era, light- hearted, well mannered romance.

The writing can be really clunky, the love interest develops without any real effort at charisma or even much interaction. And pretty early on stuff gets\u2026 weird.

Ceony hadn't learnt enough! Not enough had happened in the real world. Her relationship with her teacher had not grown to the degree that what she did made any sense.

Nothing happened for pages and pages and pages and then everything happened in the space of three chapters. It didn't give me enough time to catch up with what was going on and , sometimes, I had to re-read the page to understand fully what was happening.- The overly long descriptions. Sometimes, Ceony described something as boring as a tree for over half a page, and I began losing interest.

Upset about not being able to choose to go into the medium of her choice, she is surprised to discover Mg. Thane is nothing like she expected. When he is attacked by a Excisioner, a magician using flesh as a medium, who then steals his heart it is up to her to save him.I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars here. I finally settled on 4 because for a first book I was thoroughly impressed. Her writing was simplistic, yet beautiful making this a really enjoyable read. I'm definitely keeping an eye out for some of her later works.PositivesThe main character was not very likeable at the start being bratty and snooping through Mg. Thane's things, but she started to grow on me as she realized that things aren't what she assumed. It was a joy to watch her grow throughout the book. She is headstrong and gets herself into some bad situations. But is smart and resourceful and isn't afraid to speak her mind. I found myself liking her.My favorite character was Mg. Thane, who while a tad eccentric, did his best to be kind to Ceony even when she didn't deserve it. The world was well built. At no time did it feel like information overload, nor did I feel like I was missing details. It was shown piece by piece in a way that world. And I loved the new take on magic. How magicians manipulated mediums such as paper, rubber, plastic, metal and glass, creating things such as paper flying machines, or bullets that don't miss.The romance was a tad cheesy but I didn't hate it. You heard it here first folks. Kaora found a book where she did not mind the romance! There was no insta-love. Spotting a person across the room and instantly wanting to brush that hair out of their face. There was no love triangle. Because you aren't pretty unless you have two guys fighting for you. Ceony got to know Thane and genuinely started to care about him.The pacing was good for the first half of the book. At no time did I feel bored with it. In fact I read it in its entirety in a day, which is rare for me. I often have to switch between books.NegativesI'm going to have to put the romance here too. Mg. Thane was her teacher and he is 31 and she is 19, making it a tad bit on the creepy side.The pacing for the last half of the book was not as great as the first half. It seemed to be a little more rushed. I would have liked to see more on Lira and Mg. Thane. I felt like the author touched on it, but didn't go into too much detail.Overall I am really impressed and I recommend anyone who needs a light and clever fantasy read.Cross posted at Kaora's Corner."}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9371994-allison", "userReview": "[Ceony doesn't even get questioned seriously about what happened and how she succeeded against a blood magician who had ripped her master's heart out?

You mostly deserved five stars. You were so good! Ceony, while talented and smart and possessing a photographic memory, wasn\u2019t perfect. She didn\u2019t get every fold right the first time. She didn\u2019t take to being a folder right away, and she didn\u2019t change her mind for no apparent reason. She changed her mind because Emery Thane, while different, is also super freaking nice and he was the invisible hand behind her ability to get the education she wanted - though I don\u2019t think he wanted her to know that.The showdown wasn\u2019t flying spells. It was a struggle through a dying man\u2019s heart, seeing his memories - good and bad. Fighting through his hopes and fears so she can get out and stop the woman who she\u2019s fighting. A practitioner of dark magic, bonded to blood. Human blood. *shudder*.And in the end, all it takes is paper, words, and a strong voice to give Ceony the chance to get away, to get the heart back to its owner.To save a life.BOOK I FUCKING LOVED YOU.And then Ceony was ~falling in love~ with Emery Thane.

I honestly try not to make a habit of binning books, however life is too short for bad books and I can only put up with so much. I feel like my lack of enjoyment of this book was my penance for picking a book based on its cover ( which is awesome btw).I loved the concept but the execution just didn't work for me. The main character was alright but nothing special. I had no real investment to anyone or anything in this story. Hardly anything happened until 45%ish and even then the action was...lacking.Overall there just wasn't enough happening in this book to warrant the investment of my time.

Set in 1901 London, it gave me a distinct magic-y feeling I love so much. The atmosphere reminded me of Howl's Moving Castle somehow.It can easily be read as a standalone - the ending is well-rounded in a way that allows but does not require a sequel. Even though the MCs are 19 and 30 years old, the book itself and the world depicted in it are a little naive, as if the book is meant for younger audiences. It certainly didn't feel like any of the YA books I've ever read.I liked both of the main characters: Ceony - a practical, no-nonsense sort, and Emery - a kind, intelligent and all-around good guy. \u201cBut how will I know if he\u2019s acting strange?\u201d Ceony asked. \u201cHe\u2019s strange already.\u201dIn the beginning it surprised me a little that the school board would ship a 19-y.o. girl to become an apprentice and live with a 30-y.o. man, just the two of them in the same house.

It's one of my first reviews, so I apologise for the grammatical errors  <--- Update review Okay I don't know how I feel about this book, It was decent in the very beginning but then it went downhill and then uphill again. Its so confusing. \nWhat I like about this book:The idea of the paper magician is very interesting, I've never read a book about magicians who plays (manipulate to be precise) with paper. The protagonist was not whinny or all annoying, she's clever though occasionally she does act irrationally. Which alright as character aren't suppose to perfect or it would too of a fairytale like. I also enjoyed the romance, it's very light as thankfully there was no Insta love.And now for what I dislike about it: The book goes by really slow, so slow that I thought I'm on 40% in when in reality I'm already 80% into the novel. Also I did not really enjoy the writing style, I'm not saying it's bad or anything I just find it really hard to get into until I was about half way through it. Okay the protagonist was fine, but the villain has lack of depth and no agenda at all. Usually a good villain has a big reason for revenge. In this case this villain is not scary but plain and boring.Overall pleasant read could have been better."}, {"userName": "Mary ~Ravager of Tomes~", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1452829-mary-ravager-of-tomes", "userReview": "I struggled at times with some of the characterization aspects of this book, plus a touch of insta-love.

A young woman is sent to a magician to learn a magic she was the least interested in (considered the weakest and useless of all the different types practiced) and against her wishes no less. She makes no extra efforts to be pleasing or amenable, going into the new arrangement with quite a chip on her shoulder. And after being met by a skeleton at the door of her new abode she makes quick judgements that she soon learns may not perhaps be the entire picture after all and appearances are certainly not all they're cracked up to be. When she is put in the position of saving her master from a magician of forbidden magic, she soon learns how foolhardy she was. But she also quickly discovers more about her strength of character, sees more about the very essence of her master's soul than anyone had the right to know and even perhaps a little about love.I am a self professed hater of series and in fact it was just days ago I griped about this in another review. I dislike them for many reasons such as rehashed plots and even, I'm willing to admit, impatience for the next volume. I rarely start a series voluntarily, let alone one so hot off the presses. I eyed the blurb \"Paper Magician Series book 1\" unhappily when I noticed it but I was so captivated that I couldn't stand it and began it with the idea that I would stop after the first chapter. And here I am, several hours later with a smile on my face and very happily noting down that November is the release for book 2 \"The Glass Magician\". While at times it felt contrived (afterall our apprentice has only been such less than a month so how capable can she really be when faced with a master) and yet it pulled in so many unexpected aspects, especially that of the psyche, that I kept wanting to know more. The characters were well fleshed out (another one of my gripes about series; authors often neglect their poor one dimensional characters in the first volume as they build the story for the next volume) and while many plot lines were introduced the book itself did not end on a cliffhanger. While I look forward to the next book I won't be going mad with the wait due to too many unanswered questions.

I'm only giving it three stars because it was problematic in some ways. But once the action really hit, I was definitely caught up in the adventure! This was a late-into-the-night read for me because I couldn't stop turning those pages. The magic system was utterly unique and fascinating, and I loved watching the clever ways in which Ceony used her \"useless\" magic against such a formidable opponent. Epic!Anyway, probably a 3.5 for me when all is said and done.

Con El mago de papel me sucedi\u00f3 exactamente eso, y he quedado satisfecho. El principal atractivo de este libro es que resulta original la idea de que los magos sean capaces de controlar los materiales creados por los humanos, pero solo uno de esos materiales, no todos. No son magos con varitas ni vuelan en escobas (aunque podr\u00edan), son magos que pueden controlar el papel, el pl\u00e1stico, ciertos metales, la goma, entre otras cosas, y con eso hacer grandes cosas. \u00bfLos malos?
