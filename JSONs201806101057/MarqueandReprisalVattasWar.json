This here be a combined review of the second and third books of the Vatta's War series. While I try to post no spoilers, if ye haven\u2019t read the first book and ye keep reading this log then ye have been forewarned and continue at yer own peril . . .Well book one could have been a standalone but I am extremely glad it wasn't! The second book quickly brings about a major, surprising change for the main character, Ky Vatta, and her family. It was mind-boggling but brilliant. It certainly upped the ante. I loved the crazy mercenary company and how Ky made deals with them. I loved all the space battles. It even makes trading goods interesting.Ky continues to be a delight. I love watching her get into impossible situations and use her brain and her gusto to solve problems. These books be action-packed, have no real romance, and be filled with admirable women. I particularly love Grandma Grace. She is one tough cookie.The only minor quibble was the distrust between Ky and her cousin in book three. It made sense in terms of story telling but it did wear on me a bit. I think that overall this book, while enjoyable, felt more like a placeholder set-up book. However, the ending was very satisfying and I am extremely interested in what adventures Ky will get into next.I have already made plans to get books four and five in me mitts.

While I still read this book cover to cover more or less in a single sitting, that is definitely much more a reflection of my love for space opera than the quality of the work. The palette of \"real\" characters (as opposed to transparent props) has expanded a little, but the new faces don't have serious pyschological depth. Perhaps even more serious, deus ex machina is reaching ridiculous proportions: in a civilization spanning many, many star systems, what is the likelihood that you'll meet someone you know when you duck into the backdoor of a shop on a space-station you have never visited before? \"Of all the bars in all the towns in all the world, she has to walk into mine...\"? Indeed.If I compare this series with C.J. Cherryh's \"Alliance-Union\" series, or Lee & Miller's \"Liaden Universe\" books... well, there is no comparison. The other two have created believable and richly textured worlds filled with complex characters. Moon has written a children's book.But I do love space opera."}, {"userName": "Cathy ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526945-cathy", "userReview": "I was annoyed for a lot of the book about how perfect Ky was. She's a 22 year-old kid on her first real tour, didn't even finish the academy, but she's somehow way ahead of all of the experienced people because they're just traders and she's bloodthirsty. Ack, annoying. But she made some mistakes near the end that reduced my irritation. On the other hand, Rafe is a problem. That they just happen upon the one guy in the universe with that tech, history and skill set is too absurd; the author should have set it up so that they came upon each other in a more believable way. But I like the new characters of Stella and Toby a lot, the mercenaries were interesting, and there was more action than trading, so I'll round up from 3.5 to 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Ben Babcock", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-ben-babcock", "userReview": "I couldn\u2019t resist, guys. I liked \nTrading in Danger\n so much that I couldn\u2019t wait any longer, so I got Marque and Reprisal when last I went to the library, and here I am reading it, almost two months to the day since I read the first book. Like I said on Twitter, Elizabeth Moon writes books that are like crack\u2014except better, because it turns out that crack is actually very bad for you. The first book introduced us to Ky Vatta and provided an intense, compelling space opera. Marque and Reprisal follows up by hugely raising the stakes, dashing our hopes, and then twisting the story arc until you\u2019re just as conflicted and exhausted as Ky.When I say this book raises the stakes, I mean it raises the stakes. Remember that time in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine when the Dominion occupies Betazed, and suddenly this war got real? Same idea here. In the first book, Ky was a screw-up, but she was a Vatta screw-up. She had a vast, well-connected, wealthy family supporting her. Moon jettisons that first thing with an attack on the Vattas that leaves almost everyone dead. Eventually, Ky is aware of three other Vattas who are still alive (two of them with her). Not only does she have to deal with the trauma of losing her father, she also has to get to the bottom of who (or what) is trying to kill the Vatta family, and stop it. Fast.The first part of the book, with Ky on Belinta and then later at Lastway, drags slightly. Moon really doesn\u2019t want to skip over large periods of time very often, so while the chapters are action-packed and bleed into one another, it also means time passes pretty slowly. It\u2019s like a slightly less strict 24. Once Ky joins up with Stella and Rafe, however, things get really interesting. I don\u2019t mind at all the way Moon works viewpoints other than Ky\u2019s into the novel, because Stella\u2019s scenes with Rafe and Toby help establish all these new characters. And I was surprised by how I didn\u2019t find Rafe too annoying: it helps that Moon lampshades the \u201cbad boy\u201d character so much that it becomes a non-issue (especially, especially at the end there\u2014oh my).Stella\u2019s addition to the cast deserves some attention. This is the first time we get to see Ky interact with any Vatta for a long time. Previously, too, the other Vattas were all senior to her. Stella is more her contemporary, and with the remaining Vattas presumed dead, they are pretty close to top of the command chain now. (Can we also get a cheer for just how wonderful all the diverse women in this book are? Stella the spy, Ky the captain, Quincy the engineer, Gracie the elder, even Mehar and Beeah. This book is not MilSF, true, but it feels MilSF adjacent, and it just goes to show you don\u2019t need to stuff your cast full of testosterone.) Stella also offers a great contrast to Ky. Both have reputations as a result of their indiscretions and dishonour. Both misunderstand the other, partly because of those reputations, but also because they don\u2019t know each other\u2019s worlds. I love how Ky keeps deliberating over how much to confess to her cousin: how much should she hold back?Ky\u2019s moral dilemmas that made her so fascinating in the first book are back, and how. She straight up kills a guy in cold blood, and then she\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019d totally stop and enjoy this killing high I get, except I\u2019m icky and have a mine to disarm.\u201d That\u2019s ultra-badass and, yeah, borderline psychotic (though to be fair, the guy had it coming). I appreciate, though, that Moon moves beyond the simple \u201cI\u2019m weirded out because I like killing people\u201d dilemma. That was great for the first book, when Ky merely had to worry about the survival of her crew. As she shoulders the burden of rebuilding the Vatta trading empire and finding the source of this conspiracy, it\u2019s only natural that she faces more complicated questions. Stella probably summarizes it best when she confronts Ky about the letter of marque and asks whether Ky\u2019s first loyalty will be to Vatta or to Slotter\u2019s Key, conjecturing that a time will come (if it has not already) when those two parties\u2019 interests diverge.It\u2019s these underlying problems that really make Marque and Reprisal so satisfying. I mean, yes, on one level it\u2019s just an intense SF adventure. There are EMP mines being slingshotted down corridors and out of airlocks, zero-G knife fights, and more mercenary brinkmanship. There are hints of subtle political machinations, the kinds that make me drool. But beneath all that, there are rich canvases of thought and feeling. These characters aren\u2019t one-dimensional; this is not a Saturday morning cartoon. Beyond the sheer physical demands placed on them, I find myself just marvelling at the decisions they get asked to make (often on little sleep) and thinking that I probably couldn\u2019t do what they do.Finally, Marque and Reprisal kept surprising me. The narrative is so easy to follow, so simply told, Ky\u2019s plans telegraphed completely \u2026 but Moon always manages through a spanner into the works somehow. The simple plans get more complex, and suddenly Ky (or someone else) is improvising. So while I predicted many parts of the resolution, I didn\u2019t see all of it coming\u2014but I certainly enjoyed the result! This, to me, is a win: I love it when books have the capacity to surprise me, especially books I think I have all figured out.Marque and Reprisal is an excellent sequel to Trading in Danger. It basically replicates the elements of the first book that made it so enjoyable. However, it avoids the most common problems of sequels. Moon definitely doesn\u2019t hold back and is not afraid to make permanent changes to her universe. Similarly, she continues to find ways to put her characters into interesting situations that reveal more about them, or motivate them to change. The result is that rare combination of a resoundingly fun adventure with profound moments and deep themes. It\u2019s nothing less than I\u2019d expect from the author of \nThe Speed of Dark\n. I have a feeling I\u2019ll be devouring the rest of this series in short order.My reviews of Vatta\u2019s War:\u2190 Trading in Danger | \nEngaging the Enemy \u2192"}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51047234-kara", "userReview": "\u201cMarque and Reprisal (Vatta\u2019s War #2)\u201d continues the military scifi adventure story of Ky Vatta, her family, the McKinsey Military Assistance Corporation (I just love that name!), the corporate InterStellar Communications Corporation (ISC), and pirates - yes\u2026.pirates in space!

Then when she knows for sure that her parents, brother, uncle and cousins are dead she never even cries or seems to grieve. So...

Major crisis & well fought by our heroine, Kylara. I was a little disappointed by the sudden surge in technology. Without spoiling the story, a crucial resource is suddenly not nearly as scarce as we'd been led to think - or the rest of the universe. It stretched my suspension of belief to the breaking point. It was an almost magical fix, something that marks less than great fiction. It was still a good story, but it lost a lot of points with me for that.Kylara's development has been rather fast too. She's killed & is coming to terms with it unevenly. Those around her are too. Again, it stretched my belief, although not as badly.

First book was Trading in Danger. I found the second book to be as engaging as the first, if not a little slow to start as we watch the crisis unfold and Kylara stocking up with weapons and supplies. I did notice a trend that anyone in an authority position automatically assume the worst and try to add to Kylara's problems. Once or twice, I could see, but every time? There is something about Moon's dialog that still seems \"off\" to me. Again the impression of an almost formal give and take between characters, not the easy flow of two people or a group of people talking. My main complaint with this book came toward the end (without revealing anything plot-wise) with the whole Sexual Attraction Discussion between her, the Mercenaries, and the ISC man. I think it was meant to be humorous, but it came across as patronizing and out of place. It was awkward, didn't fit with the rest of the book and, dare I say it...downright stupid?Paraphrasing here:Mercenary Man: \"You're a young female Captain. You must be attracted to this handsome older man.\"Kaylara, \"No, I'm not. He's much too old for me and not my type.\"ISC Man, \"I don't find her attractive either.\"Mercenary Man, \"I don't believe you Captain. He's a rougish man, you are a nubile female, you have to be attracted to him and it's impaired your judgement.\"Kaylara, \"No. My judgement is just fine. I don't like his good looks and have no urge to bed him or any other male on my crew.\"And so it went for several pages, several pages too many.

Militaristic believability mixed with the good old space trader polish.

I'll be interested in finding out where she's going, especially not with the way that the book ended.As for the advancing relationships, I adore the way that any romance is being handled, both by the character and the author - not yet. Not no, but not yet. There are bigger problems to handle before anything romantic happens and to me that is entirely believable.

I liked it.But this book is more like an expanded chapter or short story, than a stand-alone novel. Ky meets new people--some of whom she befriends, some she kills--and stumbles through the remains of her disintegrating universe.I prefer this series over even the Honor Harrington stories because those, and many multi-volume SF and fantasy series, have become so sprawling that they seem to tell a history rather than a story.

The first book showed both a flash, a brush fire so to speak (minor conflict), and how \u2018competent\u2019 both mercenary and the interstellar communications people, ISC, can be in both intimidation and fixing stuff. Basically the first showed the universe as it was on the edge of massive change. The second book, this one here, showed that change. The conflict in the first book really didn\u2019t seem to require the use of the term \u2018war\u2019. Well, it\u2019s definitely war now. The communication/and financial \u2018satelites\u2019 have been taken out through many of the different solar systems.

Taking place in a damaged airlock, the conflict ended in the pink flakes of immediately frozen and dehydrated blood and took place within \u201crealistic\u201d limitations that had me almost hyperventilating for the character I most wanted to survive. That scene alone is worth reading this novel, particularly since it is a very fast novel to read (one train ride to Chicago and back with about an additional hour and a half at most).So, one might naturally wonder why I describe this as a young adult series. I don\u2019t make that distinction to denigrate the novel. I merely make that suggestion because it seems to me that the most interesting characters are \u201ccoming of age\u201d characters. They are not adolescents, though. They are young adults. Kylara Vatta, the protagonist throughout the series, is a bright and courageous young woman who chose a different road than her family expected. Through a bizarre set of circumstances (still not completely explained by the end of this volume), she ends up \u201crepaving\u201d the road of her family intentions with a newly found sense of family honor. Her cousin Stella offers interesting harmony as an unexpectedly important family member. Stella has a stigma within the family, but turns out to have undergone a maturation process since that mistake. Much like (but not identical to) the unmarried adolescent who gets pregnant and then has to show her family that she can assume adult responsibility, Stella is striving for respect within the family. Toby is a cousin who ends up stranded on his first tour of duty on one of the family transports. In spite of his inexperience, he seems to grow up quickly as Ky gives him brevet responsibilities. In this volume, there is another character\u2014a possible love interest for one or both of the female cousins\u2014who is of indeterminate age but also the scion of a famous family who has also chosen the orbit not taken. He is both interesting and still discovering himself.Another reason I believe that this is a young adult series is that many of the mentor characters and more mature crew and family members are separated from Ky either temporarily, institutionally, or permanently throughout the books. With a couple of notable exceptions, Ky has to mature without having an Obi Wan Kenobi or Yoda to be her sensei. Yet, as with bright people as a rule, it seems like none of her lessons is ever wasted. Not only is that useful for the plot (as in life), but it also serves as a welcome bit of propaganda for young people who might be reading the book. Even when one thinks that a class or a book is not relevant, it is good to internalize the lessons because you never know when it might come in handy.Although this book is named Marque and Reprisal, it is not strictly about Kylara becoming a privateer. I say, strictly, because Kylara must consider the option of becoming a privateer, but she isn\u2019t the only space captain who ever contemplated using a letter of marquee. In fact, many of the events which take place in this volume seem to be orchestrated as a result of an entire network of privateers. Should Ky become one of them or shouldn\u2019t she? That is a very viable question that is only superseded by more pressing questions of survival.I\u2019m rating this book higher than the volume which kicked off the series primarily because of the zero-G fight scene and the clever introduction of both an unexpected ally and an unexpected villain. Even though I\u2019m far from being a young adult, I expect to complete this series."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5433175-james", "userReview": "The first book in this series could have been taken for a stand alone novel - yes there were unanswered questions but overall it felt complete (for me anyway). With this one though there is no doubt that it is a part of a series. It works through the first three quarters of the book as a way of setting up the conflict for the books to come - there is action, with plenty of assassination attempts, the attacks on Vatta and Stella, Toby and Rafe's flight but it just felt like it was the prelude to the real story. Despite this feeling of lack of any real direction the first part was really well written and I loved every moment of it, which I found surprising. I suppose it was because as it was well written and kept hinting that it was about to take off just around the corner, I couldn't put it down. Definitely the mark of a good book.And in the last 100-150 pages or so it really did take off. Moon brought together her amazing ability to describe action scenes to coerce a great, action packed finale to the book. She managed to make Ky make mistakes and still look good, she developed the characters well - I liked the way that the chief engineer woman whose name I cannot remember went from the loving paternal influence to being scared, and wanting out - and introduced some great plot lines and help for the latter books in the series. My one main problem with this book, and I understand that it was a plot device, was the problem of Ky taking control of the Vatta-turned-pirate ship. Surely as it is still registered under Vatta name, she isn't claiming a prize she is just reclaiming Vatta property? Ok, so they needed a reason to get the mercs away from her and this isn't a bad device to do so, but it just confused me. This was overall a great continuation of the series and promises so much more; the writing is as good as the previous book, the plot while not as complete is solid and a great lead up to the rest of the series, and the characters! wow, the characters are well developed in my mind - other can argue otherwise of they wish, but I don't know what else they could possibly want. Anyway, I suggest that you read this series. Especially if you are a Space Opera fan, or just enjoy military Sci-Fi.

Secondly, unlike some second books in a series I didn't hate the character additions, in fact, I mostly approved of them wholeheartedly. Thirdly, Kylara Vatta remains as interesting as she was in the first book.Kylara Vatta was another family screw-up in the first book, but she was a screw-up with all the connections of her family where it suited her to use them. The very beginning of this novel tears her family, and its connections, out from underneath her in a sudden and violent fashion, but Ky doesn't crumble in the situation. She resolves to protect her remaining family, and I think that's where the interesting peculiarities of Ky's situation come out the most. First and foremost I think that she wishes to rebuild Vatta, however, she doesn't feel as if she has to conform to the Vatta standard of Trade and Profit to rebuild it. In fact, during the course of the narrative, it seems as if she's coming to terms with the idea that she's not the right person to rebuild Vatta's trading empire, but that she might be the right person to defend it and defeat Vatta's enemies. Which, from my perspective, is possibly the correct viewpoint.I enjoyed the introduction of Stella Vatta, even if she isn't my favourite character, because she acts as an easy comparison point to Ky and it is easy to see how neither conform to their family's opinions on them. Rafe is a bit of an unknown really, I enjoy sections with him and I dislike sections with him, it really depends on which version of him is speaking at any one time, which I think was intentional.One of the things that I liked most about this book, and how I see the series setting up, is the passage of time. In sections it does drag, but there remains a sense of urgency within the conflict and in space where travelling anywhere takes time.Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable read, and one that means I'll be picking up the third book soon."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35059967-laura", "userReview": "I feel about the same about this book as I did about Trading in Danger, the previous book in the series. The writing is average, but the pacing is tight and there's plenty of action to keep you turning pages to find out what happens next. The downsides are still apparent, in that character development remains somewhat surface-only and there's never really time for true emotional connections both between characters or between characters and reader.Ky has certainly developed some and she remains an interesting character to follow, but she's somewhat uneven. Sometimes she's naive and inexperienced, and other times, she's too knowledgeable and even jaded. The new characters who are introduced are much more interesting than the previous supporting cast, I'll grant that. Stella, Rafe, Toby and Jim all bring new perspectives and flesh out the universe with more types of people, but they are not yet fully realized and their motives and characters seem formed more by the plot, rather than the other way around. A common enough problem in science fiction, so I'll let it slide, because at least they're still interesting.The plot itself, while well-paced and tightly spun, is still pretty predictable, but there's just enough suspense to keep you invested to follow, even when it doesn't offer too many real surprises. That said, I'm still enjoying the series enough to continue on to the next book and find out where the story leads and how Ky will cope with whatever comes at her next."}, {"userName": "Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1154545-stacey", "userReview": "The action never stops (it took me longer to get into the first one, because the first 100 pages or so were more descriptive and lacked action). The protagonist is a bit of an enigma. She's dealing with some self-revelations that make her even more interesting, though perhaps less likeable. However, she's also kick-butt, smart, and determined, and I can't help but root for her. There's some interesting romantic tension between her and a rogue on her crew, which I can't wait to see resolved. Additionally, there's familial tension between the protagonist and a cousin, who also narrates part of the novel."}, {"userName": "Neil Davies", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2635672-neil-davies", "userReview": "The second book is every bit as good as the first.

Ky wants to rebuild the Vatta transport company and get revenge for her murdered family. Stella is more resistant to the idea of revenge though. Together they join up with a group of mercenaries, meet an old forgotten family member and come closer to discovering the truth behind the reason the Vatta family was targeted. The beginning of the novel was slow as business deals were discussed, characters were introduced and plans were made. The novel quickly picked up near the middle as a major battle took place due to a betrayal. The reader also learns part of the reason why the Vatta Transport Corp. was attacked and how someone knew exactly where to hit to inflict maximum damage and casualties. The characters are well written with Ky being my favorite. Initially she did feel too powerful, she was too good of a warrior for someone so young and experienced. However, she then made a few stupid mistakes that helped offset this. Stella was annoying and whiny, not sure why the author wrote her like that (contrast between the cousins maybe?). Rafe had a lot of mystery and hardness to him, I liked him as it was a nice contrast to the other characters. Overall an amazing science fiction novel that I would recommend to anyone who likes military science fiction."}, {"userName": "Jean Hontz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1356580-jean-hontz", "userReview": "82.

But of course Ky ended up doing just that.Kylara Vata, thrown out of her planet's military academy, had just endured her first exposure to being a trading captain in her family's trading company. It hadn't gone that well, not entirely because of her, but it certainly had given her experience.This time out, she's on an old tug of a ship, slow, old, desperately in need of an upgrade, when she learns that her family is being targeted and that Vatta ships across the known worlds are being targeted.

To be exact, someone unknown has launched a full-throttle offensive against Vatta Transport Ltd., Ky\u2019s father\u2019s interstellar shipping empire. In short order, most of Ky\u2019s family is killed, and subsequent attacks sever vital lines of communication, leaving Ky fighting, in every sense, to survive.Determined to identify the ruthless mystery enemy and avenge her family\u2019s name, Ky needs not only firepower but information. And she gets both in spades\u2013from the band of stranded mercenaries she hooks up with, from her black-sheep cousin, Stella, who\u2019s been leading a secret life, and from Stella\u2019s roguish ex-lover, Rafe.
