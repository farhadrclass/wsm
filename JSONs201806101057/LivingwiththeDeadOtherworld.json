Every chapter changed, and short chapters they were. Not only that, but almost all the points of views were from new characters of the series that don't have impact beyond this book. Her technique made her writing style suffer. When she switched from an intimate point of view to a distant one, the writing technique simplified and became a little awkward. It was pretty noticeable.While previous books would introduce new characters before they came into their own books, not so here. There were several brand new characters taking a major role and I didn't know nor care about them. Robyn is simple and rather boring. I didn't care about the new necromancer. Their developed relationship seemed force and just there because a new relationship was supposed to be, not because the chemistry makes sense.Hope and Karl were the best POV but again I'm not crazy about either of them. There's just something off-putting about Hope getting off on people getting hurt and Karl randomly robbing people of their valuables. The story is semi-clever and inventive enough but the way it's told and the characterization? Ugh. There are no series regulars besides mild mention. The Kumpania were intriguing and demented, but this plot is lightweight in comparison to others.Reading this one doesn't advance the story unless you care about Hope and Karl's development into not caring about the council at the end of the book. Can be skipped."}, {"userName": "Fables&Wren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42780417-fables-wren", "userReview": "WrensReads Review:This is definitely my least favorite of the series, though I never thought to stop reading and it had my attention ENOUGH. I wasn't like dying to know more like most of Kelley Armstrong's books.We have way too many points of views in this one. We are used to having only one, and the last book we got two which was a nice change of pace, but we got.. four or five if I am not mistaken. And only one of them we knew before this book (Hope) and even though I still felt like she was a new character to the series. What I did love about this book is that human's get involved. That's right, a human gets to see what is behind the supernatural curtain. We also meet someone who knew they had special powers (necromancer) but never knew of the community of supernatural beings until he met some of our friends in this series. Hope's best friend Robyn is in some deep crap. Like she is wanted for murder. But she didn't do it. Enter best friend, chaos-loving-half-demon Hope and her boyfriend werewolf-jewel-thief Karl and a detective that can see dead people. What I really REALLY enjoyed was exploring clairvoyance powers in Armstrong's world. We have seen and learned about werewolves, witches, necromancers, warlocks, half-demons (even though there are a lot more types to discover!) and even magicians, but not enough on the rare supernatural-beings that are called clairvoyant. They are a necessity in this book and I absolutely loved it.All in all, I am ready to get back to werewolves in the next book. Elena and Clay are my first love.WrensReads | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "I can't shrug off the feeling that Kelley Armstrong's Women of the Otherworld books are shifting more and more from urban fantasy to just plain mystery. But maybe I am just too used to her world and it seems too real to me? I don't know. Living with the Dead is another entertaining but ultimately forgettable addition to one of my favorite series. Let me sum it up.The positive:1) This book is just as page-turning as Armstrong's previous novels. Well-paced and never boring.2) Kumpania - a commune of clairvoyants - is a fascinating and twisted place, a lot of freaky stuff goes on there. 3) The ending seems to hint at a larger story arc to come, something big that will shake up the entire Otherworld. Has Armstrong been planting seeds throughout the series? I am intrigued.The negative:1) The format shifts from 1st person narrative in the other books to 3rd person from as many as 5(!) POVs, thus bringing a completely different tone to this story.2) No hot romance! Women of the Otherworld books have never been paranormal romances, but I do expect some flirting, some steamy hooking-up in these stories. The only romantic aspect in Living with the Dead comes from Hope and Karl and their relationship is not the one I enjoy - Hope continues being totally useless with her passive \"power\" and Karl is as overprotective as ever. Yawn.3) In the end, the main conflict turns out to be much ado about nothing. The event that jump-starts the mystery simply doesn't warrant the body count accumulated by the end of the book.I am reading the next book in the series though."}, {"userName": "MissM", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253444-missm", "userReview": "I really like this series overall and look forward to them, but this one was just a miss for me. The main character of the book really wasn't a supernatural at all. And the jumpy POV changes made the book feel choppy and lacked cohesion. I liked the Detective character that was introduced but overall, it just really wasn't the high point of the series for me. I'm kinda bored with Hope at this point and I'm ready to get back to more interesting characters in the series. Because Hope's power is so passive, it's just not as exciting to read. And because the normal, non-supe woman, Robyn, was really the central character, it was even less exciting on top of it.Not an awful book, but one I really just didn't enjoy like I've done with the others."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "Wow, Adele, you're a seriously disturbed individual.

I do like Finn, and I like Robyn as well. I'd be okay if they popped up in a later book.

Robyn Peltier is a PR consultant with no special powers or abilities what so ever, well\u2026 except maybe attracting bad luck. She does know how to pick her friends though, as Hope Adams and Karl Marsten come to her rescue when Robyn's problems evolve from bad to worse. This is another solid read by Kelley Armstrong. It read like a suspense novel, packed with action and a high pace. Armstrong crafts the story wonderfully and she has made up an amazing world of supernatural groups, some with very disturbing rules and morals. In several reviews I've read that others find Robyn and Hope to be boring because of their limited powers. To me that isn't an issue. The struggle is even bigger for these heroines and they do deliver as they outsmart everyone and come up with good solutions. Also: they learn from their mistakes. Even though there was very little romance in this book, this book was about love and trust: losing it, finding it and being to able to let go. It had quite some touching moments as we get to see Robyn's dead husband in his desperate quest to help his wife and we see Hope worry about her capability to stand on her own two feet. This book introduces some interesting characters who we hopefully get to see in further books: the mercenary clairvoyant Rhyse and the wonderful Finn; the necromancer cop. My two favorite people of this book however were Adelle, the deliciously wicked bitch of an antagonist, and Karl Marsten. Karl Marsten...Karl. Marsten. *Sigh.*I want one."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10633920-jay", "userReview": "[her playing quite a big role in the oncoming final shitstorm (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "I don't know who first told me that \"assuming makes an ASS out of U and ME,\" but I do know that I was young enough to be shocked that someone said ass.

Kelley Armstrong switches up her tried and true format in Living with the Dead and that was a big mistake in my opinion. Instead of sticking with her enthralling first person point of views she opts for that of the third person and gives the lead role to a previously unknown, human character. This installment also focuses on clairvoyants which are not a breed of supernaturals that readers have seen overly much up until this point and the story casts them in a pretty unfavourable light. I didn't particularly enjoy this book the first time around and I liked it even less upon the second read. I guess that after 9 novels even someone as talented as Kelley Armstrong can struggle with writing an amazing story.Living with the Dead is very, very dark and not in a good way. Adele, the main villain, is beyond nasty. She's a sociopath and a cold blooded killer. Clairvoyants' abilities are as much a curse as they are a gift because they pretty much have a 99.99% chance of eventually going insane. Definitely not good odds. I think that Adele has been a wackjob since birth; her upbringing and powers are contributing factors but there's just something inherently wrong with her. She doesn't just kill people; she toys with them and does things that are beyond twisted. Adele has sex with a mentally disabled boy in order to manipulate him into using his powers to her benefit and then gets pregnant and uses her baby to barter her way into a cabal. She then seduces his teenage brother in an attempt to hide her child's paternity. This is just one example of what lengths she's willing to go to; everything's just a means to an end to Adele. She's truly one of the most heinous characters that I've ever encountered which made this book very difficult to read. I was confused as to why Robyn, a human PR rep, was cast as the lead character. There's been no mention of her up until this point and, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that this is her one and only appearance in this entire series. One of the reasons why I enjoy the Women of the Otherworld series so much is because it follows the same characters over a twelve year span. I've grown to love all of Armstrong's creations and have a vested interest in their well-being while as Robyn came out of left field only to never be heard from again. I didn't dislike her, she's a grieving widower trying to move on with her life and I felt sorry for her, but I just didn't understand why the heck she was in this novel to begin with. Finn's another new character who's introduced in this installment; at least he's a supernatural but he too all but disappears after this book. Other than Hope and Karl, the overall story, writing style and protagonists just didn't fit in the Otherworld universe. Living with the Dead wasn't what I expected and I'd even go so far as to say that I was disappointed with this book which is a first for me where Kelley Armstrong is concerned. The story did nothing to advance the overall plot line of this series, most of the characters are strangers and I was beyond disgusted by Adele. Reading this novel a second time actually made me like it even less; I'm glad that the other 12 installments are phenomenal because if this book would have been one of the earlier ones I might not have continued with this series."}, {"userName": "Julie (jjmachshev)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/882708-julie-jjmachshev", "userReview": "Now how do I rate Kelley Armstrong's latest in her 'Women of the Otherworld' series? \"Living with the Dead\" isn't about just one woman. In a lot of ways it's not even about one couple, it's really about two men, two women, a ghost, and the question of what is love.Robyn is a woman who recently lost her love, her soulmate, to a senseless and stupid crime. She spends her time now just going through the motions of living and keeping a scrapbook about good samaritans who are killed for their deeds, furthering reinforcing the futility and stupidity of her husband's death. When, through no real fault of her own, she becomes embroiled in a battle between two supernatural factions in LA, she ends up running for her life with no idea of why she's become a target.Hope is Robyn's best friend and she and her werewolf boyfriend Karl have come to LA to do a story, but really to check on Robyn. These two will have to use all their abilities (she's half demon) to keep Robyn alive long enough to figure out who's after her and why! Then we also have a cop necromancer thrown into the mix. And with Robyn's dead husband joining the search for Robyn and her pursuers, the mix is set. If you're looking for a pure romance, don't look here. If you're looking for a mystery with paranormal elements, an unusual love story that will make you ponder what love is and is not, a story about when and how grief affects different people, and a story about just how whacked out some fringe groups can get...then really pick up \"Living With the Dead\".

It must say something good about Armstrong's talent for creating characters that I have this reaction. I can't stand Hope and that made it impossible for me to finish this book. Mostly because Hope is mentally worrying all the time about how she would react if Karl leaves her, instead of, say, how she would react if Karl got killed by a mutt. Which just goes to show what type of person Hope is. Honestly, maybe you, Hope dear, should really worry about your friend.Additionally, the shifts in viewpoint are good in terms of breaking with the standard but too often the reader is told the same thing more than once by different characters. Still I made it over half way, and Armstrong's writing is a cut above much of the rest of slush pile that is UF these days. This book hasn't turned me off her, not by a long shot, but I just don't like Hope."}, {"userName": "Beth The Vampire", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22241496-beth-the-vampire", "userReview": "ACTUAL RATING 3.5I\u2019ve been grappling with this book overnight, trying to assess the story and the ending, trying to decide whether I liked it. And instead of my decision being black and white, it has turned out more a shade of grey.Robyn, PR to a popular LA socialite, finds herself the main suspect in her clients murder. Chased by the police, and being followed by a mysterious young woman looking to harm her, Robyn does what any normal human person would do, and freaks out. Thankfully Robyn has two powerful friends, Hope (a half demon who can sense chaos), and her boyfriend Karl (a pack werewolf), who are able to untangle the web she has been caught in, and assist from a more supernatural point of view. The situation turns out to be a lot deeper than the death of Robyn\u2019s employer, and involved the Nasts and Cabals, as well as a secret commune of clairvoyants. The detective in charge, who is able to speak to ghosts, is assigned the case, but the matter becomes more complicated when the ghost helping him just happens to be that of Robyn\u2019s recently murdered husband.It\u2019s not a bad story, it\u2019s just\u2026.convoluted. There is no way this situation had to become this complicated. I feel that Hope and Karl actually made the whole situation about 10 times worse by becoming involved and trying to control everything. Then when it all came to a climax, it didn\u2019t seem to wrap itself up. Robyn was still suspected of three murders, including one of a cop, and it just said the Cabals were going to bribe and divert all further attention until the matter just went away. I\u2019m sorry, but no. How is the detective, Finn, supposed to explain all of it? Half a dozen people died on his case, there was an ambush involving a private tactical unit on the clairvoyant compound, and again a COP has been gunned down in the street, and all of this is just going to be pushed under the rug? In a story where there are numerous supernaturals, that part just goes beyond all belief.What I do love about this book, and what I have loved about all the previous entries into the series, is the characterisation. Hope is a really interesting young women, who is just coming to terms with her power and what that means. By the end she realises that she needs to make a decision by herself, even if it means sending Karl away, which she does. She does it for her, so she can make her own decisions without him making them on her behalf so she doesn\u2019t have to make the hard choices, keeping her closeted and protected. It\u2019s a great step forward for her, and I\u2019m proud of her for that. Robyn was pretty throwaway for me, Karl was his usual\u2026.manish\u2026.self. Finn was the most interesting addition, but I didn\u2019t get much of his backstory or even where his future is headed. I get the feeling that we won\u2019t be seeing him again though.The first two books in the Women of the Otherworld series were excellent, with Bitten still being one of my favourites. The third book was a major downer that made me want to throw the paperback across the room, but then it started to pick up again, although never really meeting the same heights of the beginning. We\u2019re in the tail end of the series now, and there were hints in Living with the Dead of something larger on the horizon. There have been a number of mysterious happenings in the supernatural world recently, and taken together they cannot mean anything good. I\u2019m interested to see where it all ends up."}, {"userName": "Irina Villacis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23075922-irina-villacis", "userReview": "bueno , este libro no me gust\u00f3 . bien podria haber sido una historia extra de 100 hojas node 500. tal vez tenga que ver que me cay\u00f3 mal Robbyn. solo era una llorona que recordaba a su marido muerto. si , muchos dirian no tienes coraz\u00f3n pero mira tu que no darte cuenta que tu \u00fanica amiga Hope tenia secretos guardados desde hace a\u00f1os y aparte pensar mal de ella. te pone de mal humor.creo que le dar\u00e9 un descanso a la serie hasta que me vuelva a nacer el amor o espero que ya no haya mas libros de la loca de Robbyn."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3126179-susan", "userReview": "Unfortunately my least favorite of the series so far.

At all. It was deeply disturbing and dark. It featured some characters we know: primarily Hope and Karl, but unlike any of the previous books, this was written in the third person and the real main character was a regular human we've never met before.It's been six months since Robyn's husband Damon died. Since then, she's moved to LA to start a new life for herself. She's a PR rep for a celebutante, but she's really just going through the motions. Hope is worried about her --the two are longtime friends-- so she and Karl come to visit. Shortly after they arrive, Robyn's client is killed and thanks to a string of unlikely events, Robyn becomes the prime suspect. Then Karl and Hope must figure out who really killed the woman and why, while protecting Robyn from the real killer.Investigating the case is Detective John Finnley. Finn's a necromancer, though he doesn't even really know what that means. He only knows that he occasionally sees ghosts... a skill that helps him believe Robyn is innocent, not only of her client's murder but other deaths that are piling up in her wake. The ghosts of the victims help lead his way, and so does (eventually) the ghost of Robyn's husband.Earlier, I mentioned that this story is disturbing. That's due almost entirely to our villain, a sociopathic clairvoyant named Adele. She is the real killer. It's not because she enjoys killing; she's just looking out for number one. You see, Robyn's client had the misfortune of accidentally taking an incriminating photo of Adele. That leads to her death. And the deaths that follow are also to keep Adele's secret -- that she is trying to escape from her commune of clairvoyants to join the Nast cabal. That doesn't sound that bad... standard bad-guy stuff. But there's more to her schemes. She slips birth control pills to one of her commune sisters, knowing it will eventually force the girl into what's essentially gang rape when she can't conceive a child by her husband. The husband Adele wanted for her own. She has sex with a mentally disabled boy to manipulate him into sharing his powers with her, and gets pregnant with his child. Then she seduces his younger brother, a 15 year-old, to hide the baby's paternity. She doesn't care what she has to do or who she has to do it to, to get what she wants.Adele is really a product of the environment she has grown up in... although undoubtedly, she is the worst case scenario. The commune beats its children to instill fear of the cabals; it inbreeds; uses the disabled for their powers; and we've already talked about the forced sex. It even kills those whose powers are too weak to make them useful. And even as I try to describe all this, I know it doesn't do it justice.There's a lot going on here. In addition to all the stuff with Robyn, Finn & Adele, we can't forget about Hope and Karl. Their relationship is at a crossroads. And Hope has a lot of uncertainty about her future. And in the end, we see that the major developments in this book and the previous ones are intertwined, perhaps in some greater purpose, or bigger picture. I find that very intriguing. It was a solid installment... it just felt... off. And I missed the romance. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1325398-jennifer", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on my review blog : Falling Off The Shelf.Robyn Peltier never knew that moving to Los Angelas would be such a eye-opening experience. It's one thing following around a famous celebutante like Portia Kane, clearly another when your being chased down by psychotic murderers. All she ever wanted to do was move away from the horrible memories of her husbands death, not walk straight into more. When her client is gunned down in the back room of a local night club, Robyn is the prime suspect for murder. Hope Adams is Robyn's best friend, and she will do anything to clear her good friend's name. It's crazy enough that Robyn is being hunted down by the police for a murder she didn't commit, but now they have to worry about being stuck in the middle of a turf war between Otherworld Cabals. Hope wants to keep the secrets of the Otherworld as far from her friend's ears as possible, but it may be the only way to save her. It's going to take a lot of help to clear her of this one, and Hope knows just the people who can get the job done.I've been a big fan of Kelley Armstrong's Women of the Otherworld Series, and it's no surprise that I would love this book. I read a lot of reviews on Amazon before reading this book, and I was a bit skeptical. A lot of people said they got confused with the constant point-of-view change, but personally I didn't have a problem with it at all. Don't get me wrong, there were a lot of different point-of-views in this installment, from Robyn, to Hope, to Karl, and even the murderer. It was a real brain boggler in the beginning. As soon as I got my bearings, which didn't take long, just a few short chapters, I was able to enjoy this book as much as I have enjoyed every other installment in this fabulous series.I loved how Robyn was determined to do her part in helping to find the murderer of her client, while not really knowing the full scheme of things. She put herself in danger quite a few times, and on many occasions needed the help of her friends to get out of it, but she did it in stride. I honestly don't know how I would react in her situation, being hunted by both the police and a psychotic killer. I'd probably end up climbing under my bed and hoping for the best.I was super excited to finally learn more about Hope Adams, and her lover Karl Marsten. They've shown their faces in previous installments in this series, but I've been wondering when they would surface as main characters. They had always had an on and off again romance brewing, and it was nice to see how things turned out between them here. I'm worried about what will occur in the coming novels with Hope though, because she has some big choices to make, and I hope she will make the right ones. It makes me want to pick up the next installment right now and read it, but unfortunately I'll have to find a way to get my hands on it first. I can't wait to see where things will go with the Otherworld in the next installment, Frostbitten."}, {"userName": "Celine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine", "userReview": "In Living with the Dead we continue with the Hope and Karl storyline, this time adding Hope's best friend Robyn. On many points Living with the Dead is very different from its eight predecessors, and in my opinion this is not a good thing. After being widowed at twenty-eight, Robyn takes the job of being Portia's PR person. When Portia is murdered in a club and Robyn flights the scene to chase after the killer, she is number one suspect on the police's list. Together with her friend Hope and Hope's boyfriend Karl, she gets caught up in several plots to kill her.Overall I think Living with the Dead's main problem is the severe lack of focus. The story is all over the place, with tons of characters each having their own motivation for their actions. Living with the Dead is written from multiple points of view in third person, creating a whole chorus of voices instead of the steady, personal first person view we're used to.One of Ms Armstrong's forte's is usually creating a mystery. I'm always fully engaged into the plot, trying to figure everything out along with the characters. Because we have so many POVs here, the reader is privy to more information than the characters. For example, the reader knows Detective Finn is actually a good guy trying to help, while Robyn and Hope are constantly trying to stay away from him. I absolutely hate having to see characters making prejudices about each other while all I want to do is bump their heads together and scream \"YOU'RE ON THE SAME SIDE HERE!\". This all makes for a frustrating, and in the end unsatisfying read.It saddened me to see Hope and Karl's relationship to be reduced to a standard male-dominated one. I don't think Hope stood her ground enough, and most of the story she felt more like a needy puppy than an adult woman. I love the couples in the Women of the Otherworld series that are equals, like Paige and Lucas. Hope and Karl were okay in the previous book, Personal Demon, but I don't think Living with the Dead did them justice. In Personal Demon I loved how they were sweet to each other, how they had a healthy and loving relationship>. I didn't see any of that in Living with the Dead. There are no romantic moments, most of the time it's just Karl ordering Hope around. In the end I did enjoy the story, even though at times it is overly gruesome (it features a commune that celebrates inbreeding and torture of children). Ms Armstrong knows how to write an engaging story. Sadly Living with the Dead was my least favourite book of her so far."}, {"userName": "Alyssa Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4665768-alyssa-nelson", "userReview": "This was the weakest book of this series that I\u2019ve read so far. My guess is that it\u2019s because it\u2019s mainly told from the perspectives of people who don\u2019t know about the supernatural community, but that information has to be present somehow; I also felt as though the story itself dragged. I was about a quarter of the way in when I thought: wow, that\u2019s short, it\u2019s going to end soon! And then I kept having that same thought the rest of the way through.It\u2019s not a bad book, however, it\u2019s just that the other books of the series are amazing, so this pretty good one fell flat. It follows typical Women of the Otherworld style, where it has a little bit of romance going on, but that\u2019s a side note to the main thriller aspect of the book. The antagonist of this book is truly crazy, which led to a lot of intense, very sad situations. I like that we get to see a couple of outsiders being brought into the fold and see what it\u2019s like when they realize that the world isn\u2019t as straightforward as they thought it was. My favorite part was all of the misunderstandings that arise when the characters tried the theorize as to what was going on \u2014 everyone kept overthinking the series of events and were so mistrustful of everyone else so that it took a really long time for the characters to work out who was actually on whose side and who they could work with.I liked reading about more of Hope and Karl, and it was nice to see Hope taking charge. Their relationship is develops a bit more in this series, but what\u2019s important is that Hope is starting to figure out who she is and what she wants, so in order to make room for that, their relationship is left dangling at the end, so I\u2019m hoping to get some resolution on that in the next book.Basically, this is an amazing series, and this was a pretty-okay installment of it. I\u2019m hoping this book was just a hiccup for the series overall and it doesn\u2019t signal a decline to one of my favorite all-time series, but I\u2019ll have to read the others to find out!Also posted on Purple People Readers."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "Hope and Karl return to the next addition to the women of the otherworld. This time they are trying to save Hope's friend Robyn. Robyn, who has no supernatural abilites at all, and who is mourning the recent murder of her good Samaritan husband, Damon, and trying to tolerate her job as a PR representative for Portia Kane, a tabloid celebutante. But when Portia is shot and Robyn becomes the prime suspect, she flees, only to find herself inexplicably in the middle of the supernatural world Hope has been trying to shield her from. Stalked by a psychopathic clairvoyant and tracked by the cop, John Findley, who happens to see dead people, Robyn is way out of her league.John is a necromancer by trade, and would have been a great storyline had they added Jaime Vargas to the mix. I mean c'mon, think of the possibilities!Warning to all those attempting to read this as a standalone. Don't! Yes, it could be read as a stand-alone, but then you are missing out on key parts of the storyline. It helps if you're familiar with the series, and things such as the interracial council, vampires, Hope Adams, Karl Marsten, the Nast cabal, Savannah, Eve, Lucas Cortez, Paige Winterbourne, Kristof Nast, Sean Nast, Jaime Vegas, Clay and Elena, Jeremy. All of them turn up, either in person or by reference. The only problem, in my humble opinion, is that the story is told from various characters prospectives, and you have to really pay attent or your lost."}, {"userName": "Francesca the Fierce (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3108364-francesca-the-fierce-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "This was a nice, refreshing installment in the Women of the Otherworld series. I really liked the twists and turns in this story, and there was sure lots of that and lots of action. In my opinion a very well put together story into an elaborate world.My only complaint was the fact that we didn't know most of the characters involved, so this could \"almost\" be a stand-alone story (you wouldn't need a lot of background story to understand it). I did come to like Robyn and Finn. Even though Damon, her husband's ghost was still around, and I knew they would get a moments reunion, I was rooting for Robyn and Finn to get together, which is why at the end of the book I was still a bit frustrated. But I guess there's always hope for the next book. And if I must add one more thing.... How hard could it possibly be to turn yourself in to the cops! LOLI really enjoyed the Hope and Karl moments we got throughout the book. And, of course, I wanted to cry at the end of the book, which is why I'm dying to get my hands on the next book already and see how it all unfolds.I also enjoyed getting to see different viewpoints, I think that gives the readers a complete understanding of everything going on.If you are looking for romance, this is not the book for you. It's more of a mystery with a taste of paranormal, but I like mysteries, so I enjoyed this one a lot!"}, {"userName": "Carolyn F.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2624012-carolyn-f", "userReview": "[Why is Robyn's husband still going to hang around if she feels there's been closure?

Karl is not my favourite pack member cause the favourite positions are commandeered by the surviving original pack members but I do love him! He is the major redeeming factor in the book! That and I love learning more about such an elusive supernatural type. Clairvoyants are one of the rarest supernatural races and generally stay hidden, even from other supernaturals for fear of being forced into 'employment' by cabals, despite the fact that overuse of their powers causes madness in them the same way it does to necromancers as we seen in Industrial Magic.Adele is a vile character and I couldn't find any sympathy for her, she was a real sociopath, only interested in her own well being caring for nobody and nothing else. The things she did while constantly excusing herself and blaming her reprehensible acts on others made her a truly replusive villian that you can't help hating.Rhys was an interesting character and him I did like, he wasn't the typical mercenary or a self-centred one like Xavier Reese was. He seemed like a mercenary with morales and principles unlike most of the mercenaries we've met in the books.I did like Robyn and it was interesting having a human as a narrator which hasn't happened in the series before and seeing how she reacts to the news about her best friend Hope and the exsistence of supernaturals. She actually handled it pretty well though a lot of that was probably because of how close she was to Hope.Hope grows a good bit in this and learns to better handle her demon side and find some balance though she realises she has to take a short break from Karl, not in the sense of breaking up with him but more learning to trust herself more and handle decisions herself instead of looking to him for all the answers. She's also realising she needs more to satisfy her chaos hunger then the council jobs alone can provide.I also liked Finn, both as a character and narrator. It was interesting seeing his reaction to finding out he wasn't quite as speacial as he thought he was. It was interesting as well to learn that though his powers went way back in his family they were totally isolated from and ignorant of other supernaturals, including other necromancers. He hadn't even heard the term applied to him before meeting Damon's ghost. It was admirable that at the end he was taking steps to learn more about his powers and meet other supernaturals. I also felt bad for him that at the end he was second guessing every gesture of friendship Robyn made thinking she was only offering in the hope that her dead husband Damon was with Finn.Like I said while not the best book in the series it was still very good and interesting to read but it always takes me the longest to read out of the series!"}, {"userName": "Tez", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090898-tez", "userReview": "An innocent human learns of the supernatural amongst us in Kelley Armstrong's Living with the Dead.Robyn Peltier's client has been killed, and she's being set up for murder. Still recovering from her husband's death, the last thing she needs is her pal Hope Adams and her guy Karl Marsten parading their coupleness in her face, but they're the only ones who have insight into who the murderer really is...and with whom she's in cahoots.But Robyn doesn't know that Hope is a half-demon and Karl is a werewolf. And when she does find out, Hope and Karl are less than civil to her. It's easy to relate to Robyn, who's in over her head, and struggling with her grief. Hope and Karl, meanwhile, are rather annoying with their relationship, which takes a distinctly emo turn.Adele Morrissey, however, is a fascinating antagonist, thanks to the new world she brings to this series. Clairvoyants are not entirely unlike werewolves - they both stick with their respective groups, and try to get work in human society. The kumpania specialises in celebrity photography, as their remote-viewing skills help them anticipate a subject's moves, and therefore arrive before other paparazzi. This in itself isn't interesting, but what happens in the kumpania surely is...There are strict rules and regulations to make sure their kind doesn't die out, which means carefully arranged pairings. To avoid birth defects from in-breeding, occasionally outsiders with clairvoyance are brought in, like Adele was when she was five. Kumpania life doesn't suit her at all, but if she leaves they'll murder her.But what's most disturbing and intriguing about the kumpania is who's living underground - and why. It truly makes you step back and look on in awe of the author's ideas. Wow.Told in third-person from six points of view, if you've missed reading the previous books in the series, this might be the easiest (minus the first, Bitten) to read as a standalone. There's information that'll clue you in to what's happened previously, but I've been fortunate enough to read this series in the correct order (which rarely happens with a series as long as this). And scattered amongst this novel are plenty of loose ends from various books that can, and should, be picked up later in the series. A character will be going on business to Australia, and I dearly hope my country gets some decent story time...though the \"opera house\" comment should've been revised. Try to avoid the obvious, people - there's more to Oz than Sydney and its icons. But I'm from Melbourne ;-)Also, if you can believe that someone can survive a bullet to the brain, best keep tuned to the rest of this series, as I certainly hope this situation is explained and that the character gets more story time in future novels. The author clearly has plenty of ideas to share...all we can do is hope she chooses to write about the ones we want."}, {"userName": "Melindeeloo", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766907-melindeeloo", "userReview": "Pleasant enough visit to Armstrong's OtherworldLiving with the Dead is not quite what I expected coming on the heels of Personal Demon (Women of the Otherworld, Book 8), which left Lucas in a quandry that I had thought would lead to some interesting upheaval in the overall story arc of the series. Instead Lucas is a minor off-screen character here and we continue on with half choas demon Hope and her werewolf mate Karl. But Living with the dead is more multithreaded than Armstrong's previous books and Hope and Karl share the screen time with: 1) Hope's best friend and grieving widow, human Robyn, who muddles into a murder scene and is accused of killing her Paris Hilton-like boss 2) the actual murderer (it's not a spoiler, we're 'in the know' all along) a clarvoiyant who is willing to rack up the body count to keep a secret and 3) the ghost whispering Police detective, Finn, who is aided in his investigation of the murder by a ghost who has a personal interest in seeing Robin cleared. Out of all of the characters in the book I think that I enjoyed Finn and his ghostly assistant the most. While Living with the Dead was a pleasant enough read, and I am now officially tired of Hope. In the last book I was happy to see more of her and Karl, and glad to see them back together but now -- even though I've always loved the werewolf jewel thief -- I'm ready to move on to more Nast/Cortez cabal intrigue or to check-in with some of the other Otherworld council members. I don't know what's up next for the women of the Otherworld, but if you want to see more of the men, Armstrong is releasing an anthology of stories (some were originally available on her website), The Living with the Dead (Women of the Otherworld, Book 9), so you can find out the scoop on Jeremy and Clay while having the satisfaction of knowing that Armstrong is donating profits from the book to charity."}, {"userName": "Wealhtheow", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow", "userReview": "Hope's old friend Robyn recently lost her husband and is lost to grief. Hope is a half-chaos demon who works for the tabloids and the supernatural Council, but she drops everything to go stay with Robyn for a while. It turns out Robyn needs her help more than she ever expected--because Robyn's starlet client has just been murdered, and Robyn is the number one suspect. It's up to Hope, her werewolf boyfriend Karl, and a cop who can see ghosts to find the truth. One annoying thing about listening to this book instead of reading it is that I couldn't skim, which is how I usually read Armstrong's novels. She restates practically everything, particularly in regards to characters' relationships with each other. Hope and Karl talk about their feelings in every single chapter; Robyn constantly thinks about how much she misses her dead husband; the book goes over how Robyn and Hope met and became bffs at least twice (though Robyn has never been mentioned before this book)...Even the action is talked over; every time someone does something, they ruminate on it and then talk about it with at least one other character. And then the *other* characters talk about it. It feels endless. The plot itself is pretty light-weight, and I'm sick to death of Armstrong's need to make an opposite-gender True Love hottie for every character she introduces. But there's a certain fun to novels with a mix of adventure and interpersonal relations, so I'm sure I'll read more in this series. One note: the voices the audiobook reader did were *awful*. All the women got breathy little girl voices, and all the men but Karl and Finn (the two male love interests, natch) had serious lisps.

That's essentially what this book is about. The book is told from four different people's perspective. It never gets overwhelming but there is a case for the argument that there are too many narrators. For the second book in a row the recurring characters are Hope and Karl. Because of the story they weren't at the heart of the action as much as their previous outing but by no means were they relegated to the background. I don't think they need to be in the spotlight in another book though, we've seen Hope learning to deal with her powers and the pair of them explore their relationship to the point I don't think there's anything more to say about them. I can see them being used to help out in situations but not to lead a story. There were two new characters introduced. One I can't see being brought back and one I simply hope doesn't return. Finn was a tolerable character who served his purpose. If he returns I'd not be upset but I can't see what he'd be used for. Robyn on the other hand bored me. Yes she was dealing with a whole new world (which she was told about in a scene that should have had the words \"PLOT DEVICE\" in big flashing letters) but she did nothing but get in the way and run from danger. The tagline for the book is \"Some secrets are best left buried\". They may have been big secrets to a couple of the cast but nothing was huge or world changing. An average book following on from a really good one. The book teased at the end that something big could be approaching because of unheard of occurrences taking place throughout the series. Finding out whether anything comes of this is what now makes me want to continue and finish the series."}, {"userName": "Chibineko", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4436152-chibineko", "userReview": "I couldn't wait to get my mitts on this book, having been aching with anticipation to see what some of my favorite characters were up to. Turns out, the anticipation was a little bit better than the book. This latest entry into the WotU series focuses around not just one, but at least four other people. There's not a lot of rhyme or reason to when shifts occur or even why it's necessary for so many people to be narrators. (My guess is that it was just easier for Armstrong to write as the villain in order to divulge her details rather than for her to think up a way for the heroines to find the info.) It's honestly a little hard to follow at times. The plot is that Robyn (a decidedly NON-magical or otherwise Underworld-ish woman) is suspected for the murder of a celeb client that she was hired to promote. Luckily for her, she knows Hope (who is a WotU) who attempts to try to not only clear her friend's name, but keep her from being killed by a psychically inclined psychic. While I did enjoy the book immensely, it just wasn't as good as some of the other books in the series. It wasn't nearly as bad as the plodding Industrial Magic, but it just lacked a certain something. Since this is the 9th book in the series, I can't really complain too heavily since long series are bound to get saggy from time to time. Armstrong's books are pretty good for such a long series, especially considering how abysmal some other length series authors' books have become. Newcomers to the series may grow a little bored with the lack of pizazz, but fans should enjoy this latest entry into the series."}], "description": "The men and women of the Otherworld \u2013 witches, werewolves, demons, vampires \u2013 live unseen among us.
