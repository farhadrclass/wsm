I will say I hate that bitch. We've been without power for almost five days now. I have discovered something about myself. Yes, I'm grateful that we didn't suffer more damage than we did and I feel heartbroken for all the people that did. Including my close neighbors. But what I discovered was...I'm not cut out for this shit. If the zombie apocalypse happens tomorrow..just look for me.\nAnyways, enough of my boring TMI stuff. I was in need of book entertainment and since I snoozed and missed out on requesting the super popular Bone White I realized that I had another Malfi book that I was a total slacker and hadn't read yet. And of course with my luck the one I choose was an end of the world one. Perfect timing Shelby, you dumb ass.Eight year old Ellie used to stand her toys up at attention at her door when she was younger, forming a \"Night Parade\" of protection in her sleep.But what happens when the intruder is hidden? People have realized that the birds have disappeared and bugs are running rampant. (I hate birds and bugs both so I'm already shuddering)Then people start displaying weird symptoms-such as delusions, weird bleeding and then death.\nIt's not the Zika, calm down. It's called Wanderer's Folly. I don't want to catch that stuff either.Ellie's dad David is on the run with her. Her mom has died and David thinks that the 'government' is going to take Ellie to test on next. This dang book. Get ready to eat all your fingernails off if you read it. You can't stop though. Something might happen! Or at least that's how I felt. I love when an author makes it so that you can't put the book down because your heart is beating faster and you HAVE to know what happens next.Booksource: Netgalley in exchange for review"}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "Wanderer's Folly-that's the name of the contagion at the center of The Night Parade. As far as plagues go, it does its own thing, but it usually involves bleeding copiously from the nose and intense hallucinations. It's not restricted to just humans either, some animals have also been infected. This is the background in which we find David and his 8, (almost 9!), year old daughter Ellie; both trying to avoid the plague and survive while on the run. If you want to know more than that, you'll have to read this excellent book. What I liked most about this story was the building dread-the reader never had the chance to fully relax, because just when you thought everything was cool, it was NOT, and then you were right back where you started- which in my case was nibbling my nails and turning the pages. And that's another thing-the pacing. The chapters were mostly short and because there was a lot of action happening, or on the verge of happening, I just kept on going like the literary version of Nemo. Just keep reading...The characters were good and memorable, but there isn't a big cast here which was fine with me. I think that contributed to the quick pacing as well. So there you have it: a cool, scary plague, characters you can root for, fast pacing, and what I thought was an interesting plot, even if not altogether original. I recommend this book for all these reasons and not just to fans of horror, but to fans of thrillers and apocalyptic fiction as well. Pick up The Night Parade and see what it's all about.

I was thinking it was going to be about insects killing everyone! LOL! Yes, the insects are crazy everywhere after the birds disappear and some creepy stuff happen here and there but it's not an insect killing people book. :-) David Arlen runs away in the night with his daughter Ellie because some peeps at the CDC want to experiment on her to see if she can cure THE DISEASE. That didn't work out so well for David's wife so they are on the run. But there IS something different about Ellie. <---let me backtrack and say, there is a part with an ice cream truck coming into the neighborhood at midnight that totally has me creeped out still. Nothing bad happens, it's just the thought and I can't get it out of my head! So, moving on... Ellie has some things she can do. Uggg, how do I not give out spoilers! Anyway, she does these things and it kinda freaks her dad out but he still loves her and they are on the run to his brother Tim's place. He's a good guy too. David keeps getting calls on his phone from the doctors to bring her in and stuff. I wanted to smack him because.. uh.. trace the phone... hello! Throw it away. And through-out the book Ellie is carrying around a box of birds eggs. They tell about it at the end of the book but I think the significance was lost on me. My little brain doesn't work that well. At any rate it's a sweet thing with the eggs. Anyway, so like if you get this disease you just start wandering around and seeing things and other stuff before you keel over. I kept thinking this was the end of days with plagues and miracles and weird stuff, but then it could all just be the hallucinations. See, there is the twist. I'm sure someone with more smarts will figure it all out. I did love Ellie's character. She's was a really good little girl and I think she's going to do great things. And I like the fact that good people still know what to do to the evil people.

Stop by and say hey.Set during the onset of an apocalypse in the form of a plague, The Night Parade is part road trip, part survivalist thriller, part emotional relationship drama and, fortunately for me, all parts were good.The plague is dubbed Wanderer\u2019s Folly because it makes you lose your marbles before killing you. You might wander about in your undies and do such strange things like setting your house aflame or walking off a cliff before dropping dead. Yikes, I don\u2019t know about you but those images haunted me. It was horrifying and scary and seeing as I love these types of stories, I was in it from the very beginning. David has blood on his sleeve and is trying to outrun the plague and keep his daughter Ellie safe from an evil doctor. That\u2019s all about all we know when the story begins. As things slowly unravel, we learn everything but it takes its sweet time getting there and I will not spoil the trip for you. The getting there is all the fun (well, fun isn\u2019t exactly the appropriate word for this emotional and grief laden story). The book is filled is with scary people, frighteningly large bugs and lots of them, fatherly love and strange discoveries. There is such pain and sorrow in both David and Ellie\u2019s past and nothing but fear in their future but they manage to keep going. I enjoyed reading about them both. It\u2019s a gripping and well-paced read that, unlike many of these types of stories, never forgets about its characters. The world may have gone to shit but humanity still survives. I recommend it highly and hope there is another book set in this world because there are a few plot points I\u2019d like to see expanded upon. 4 \u00bd Stars*I received an ARC from Netgalley in exchange for a review."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17371689-kimberly", "userReview": "THE NIGHT PARADE, by Ronald Malfi, is a book I've been looking forward to ever since I saw that it was scheduled to be released. As you can see by my rating, I was not at all disappointed.Malfi is truly gifted when it comes to storytelling in general, and characterization. As soon as I began THE NIGHT PARADE, I fell completely into the lives of David Arlen and his daughter, Ellie. Their emotions, reactions, and conversations were all so vivid that they could have been happening--in the real world--right before you. These characters showed a true parent/child relationship that was real; something readers could identify with.The \"sickness\" became known as \"The Folly\"--a disease of the brain that the afflicted could never be cured of. The method of how it was spread remained a mystery. The only thing David Arlen was certain of was that his daughter was . . . special . . .\n\"They're not looking for me, baby . . . They're looking for you . . . \"\nHow far will a Father go to protect his only child?There are no limits.There are other characters in this novel that Malfi brings to life with the same expertise. David's wife, Kathy--who's emotional turmoil and sense of duty are so sadly poignant, that I felt I was with her, and able to understand her internal trauma. David's step-brother, Tim, who lived \"off the grid\" long before the world's latest problem began--his thoughts and motivations were just as plausible as were those who remained behind, in denial that the world as they knew it had changed.\n\". . . What changed your plans so drastically that you decided this horrible madness was the better option? . . . \"\nAs this evocative journey continued, every little aspect brought to our attention--the sorrow, isolation, occasional chaos and madness--all combined to bring this tale alive. THE NIGHT PARADE is an emotional, suspenseful story that very often strayed from the path I was expecting, keeping my undivided attention throughout the entire novel.Highest recommendation!*I received an advance e-copy of this book through NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/351830-alexandra", "userReview": "* Review copy provided by NetGalley * For some books part of the enjoyment is going in blind, and letting the story unfold as the author has written it.This makes such books difficult to review, at least if your goal is to try to help others decide if they might enjoy a story and do it without spoilers. As a reader I know the frustration of trying to figure out if a book will be for me, when reviewers WON\u2019T TELL ME ANYTHING, but also understanding and appreciating the desire not to spoil the book for others.That is my dilemma with \u201cThe Night Parade\u201d. The blurb reveals the world has fallen victim to a terrifying plague. That Ellie is \u201cspecial\u201d, \u201cwho may be the key to a cure\u201d. And that her father David has taken her on the run. And I\u2019m not going to reveal more of the plot in my review, because trust me, trust the author, learning what is going on in the way it\u2019s revealed as written is an enjoyable ride. And I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil that for anyone.What would you do, how far would you go, to keep your kids safe?David and Ellie, running through a world turned into a nightmare. All they have is each other. One man and his little girl.We start off with David on the run with his 8 year old daughter Ellie. We don't know why, we don't know what from. But it is compelling and intriguing. I was hooked from the first page.Then we start to get a glimmer of preceding events, which are told in occasional flashback chapters so that as we go along we\u2019re given more and more information as to what is going on and what has lead up to where we are now.In my opinion this technique is used effectively, keeping the action going and pulling us along, allowing us to learn more of the backstory without stopping the action too much. Both the present story and the events of the recent past are interesting and this book never drags.And if you think clowns are creepy? (Yes, yes they are!) Forget clowns. This is creepy:\"The music grew louder, louder, until it was right outside the house in the street. In the summertime, that jocular little melody would send the neighborhood kids flooding into Columbus Court, anxious for a Rocket Pop or an Italian Ice. But now, in the dead of winter and in the middle of the night - David glanced at the alarm clock on the nightstand and saw that it was well after midnight - the sound of that tune unnerved him.\"But the real power of this story are the characters, particularly of David and Ellie, and their relationship.David isn\u2019t all that special, just a regular man with a regular life. He\u2019s not the Terminator, he\u2019s not unusually strong, or brave. He\u2019s a college professor. But he\u2019ll do whatever he needs to do, whatever it takes, to protect his daughter and keep her safe.Ellie is a strong kid, unusually insightful, but still a kid. She gets upset and scared. She gets angry at her dad even though she loves him. It takes talented writing to make a character feel so real and believable when they\u2019re also given unique abilities.But what really gives this story its heart is their relationship. And that I think is the subtle power of this story. Over the course of the story the love between father and daughter becomes almost tangible.Although this story does have a creepy factor it seems more Suspense/Thriller than Horror to me. It reminds me a bit of \u201cFirestarter\u201d (one of my favorite Stephen King books). A man and his daughter on the run, the young girl special in a way that makes her valuable to powerful people.I haven't read anything by this author before, and I am now wondering why.

The story takes place over a period of a week, with a father and his 8 year old daughter, Ellie, on the run from authorities who believe Ellie might hold the key to a cure for a disease running rampant across the globe.It's not completely clear at the outset why the two are fleeing except that Ellie's mother died while in hospital under the care of those now pursuing them. Howeve, more detail on that part of the story is slowly revealed as we find out what happened in the months leading up to her death. There are some of the usual tense scenes that accompany a story like this, but mostly it is about the father and daughter, their relationship, and their attempts to come to terms with a world that has completely changed.While it wasn't exactly the plague apocalypse horror book I was expecting, I thought it was quite good."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9684061-melissa", "userReview": "With so many authors and books on my radar, I\u2019ve still somehow never come across a book by Ronald Malfi. I have to say, I\u2019m pretty impressed with his style. The categorization of this book as a horror novel is what initially piqued my interest. It\u2019s no secret, I occasionally like to dabble in books that creep me out and this one delivered. Think The Walking Dead, but without the zombies. We\u2019re thrust into a story of a father and daughter on the run, in the middle of the night. They\u2019re in a stolen car headed somewhere, but where? And why? The author does a great job of alluding to what is going on, but he doesn\u2019t come right out and say it. Instead, you get to sit back and watch him piece the full story together with flashes between the past and present. The anticipation made it a fast-paced, but completely unnerving ride. \n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019re all just ghosts floating about through the ether, occasionally bumping into one another.\u201d\n\nThere were so many things that set me on edge - the ice cream truck (I surely will never look at one the same), the eerie paper plate masks, the increase in creepy crawlers (a spider eating a rat? *skin crawling*) and the sheer desolation of some areas. Not to mention, the madness. That had to be the worst part. Just the thought of contracting this unknown virus that attacks your brain and brings on hallucinations was enough to scare me. I can only imagine how much I would be freaking out in David and Ellie\u2019s situation. And how could you put your trust in anyone?And the bird eggs? What gives? Why in the heck was she dragging those around? I\u2019m not sure if I still even get it. So if you\u2019re reading this and you do, please tell me. This story was so much more than just an apocalyptic meltdown. It\u2019s was also about the unwavering love a father has for his daughter. Amongst all the bleakness, David and Ellie were definitely the light. His determination to protect her at all costs and her drive to help people had me rooting for them to make it. I could see what was coming, but I wanted to look the other way and pretend I didn\u2019t. I wanted to be wrong.I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The setting, the words, the ending.

From the first chapter of The Night Parade, it was evident that Malfi's caliber of writing was a notch above what I'm used to seeing from the genre. The verbiage and imagery raised the writing into something majestic. It makes me want to throw away my laptop and quit pretending that I could ever write something of this quality. OK, maybe that's a bit harsh, but you get where I'm going with this.The Night Parade starts out with David and his daughter Ellie on the run from the government. There's an illness going around called Wanderer's Folly and it makes people hallucinate and bleed out of their noses before they either drop dead, kill themselves or kill someone else. The CDC doesn't know if it's spread by air or contact or if it's somehow imbedded in our DNA and something has caused it to turn on in some people. All they know is David's wife, Kathy, was immune before they killed her off testing her to death and that Ellie is also immune...and they want her.The story has a nice slow build up that ratchets the tension to the breaking point. Malfi also uses a series of flashbacks that slowly unravel the past slowly before our eyes. It's extremely effective in teasing the reader with just enough information that only leads to a whole slew of more questions that need answering. The characters are vivid and masterfully three-dimensional where you can literally feel the tension and exhaustion that David is going through in your bones. The Night Parade has shades of Firestarter, Swan Song, and The Dead Zone all mixed within, yet at no time does it feel derivative. It has everything that I look for in a great story - strong characters, realistic dialogue, a slow build up of tension that leads to a climactic ending, and a lasting impact that keeps you thinking about the story long after you've closed the cover.5 Oriole Eggs out of 5* I received this ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest reviewYou can also read my other reviews and author interviews at:https://kenmckinley.wordpress.comhttp://intothemacabre.booklikes.comhttps://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5..."}, {"userName": "Kirstin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30037960-kirstin", "userReview": "Suspenseful story of a father and his young daughter on the run after a plague outbreak.

Then the madness began . . .They call it Wanderer's Folly--a disease of delusions, of daydreams and nightmares. A plague threatening to wipe out the human race. It's been two years since the disease started claiming lives and now David Arlen has gone on the run trying to protect his young daughter. In the beginning no one knew what was happening but once scientists developed a test for the Wanderer's Folly it was discovered David's wife was immune. She then volunteered to try to help cure the disease but now she's died and David is worried they will come after their daughter and he can't let that happen. The Night Parade is a dystopian type of horror read that takes turns telling the story from what is happening in the present with the characters and alternating with flashing back to the beginning of the disease coming about. It's very easy to follow along with what is happening and get the story of how David and his daughter have come to be on the run. I have to say this one reminded me a lot of The Fireman by Joe Hill while I was reading it. A disease slowly killing off the population and the characters hiding from those in charge so I knew getting started with this one I'd probably end up really enjoying it. There are some pretty creepy moments all throughout this book. Early on an ice cream truck appears and as innocent as that sounds it just gave me the creeps. There's spiders big enough to eat mice.... yes, I'd be high tailing it out of there. And all along with the creepiness we have some great characters to follow along. David and his love for his family was incredibly touching and little Ellie was wise beyond what her years should allow. Overall, great dystopian horror that I'd definitely recommend.

This is exactly what I want to read! Ronald Malfi covered just about every human emotion possible: fear, apprehension, hope and hatred. He made me laugh, and Goddamn it, he made me cry. When I finished reading The Night Parade I gave myself a good swift kick in the buttocks for not having read Malfi until now.The Night Parade follows David Arlen and his daughter, Ellie, as they run from the threat to his daughter\u2019s future. Ronald Malfi spends a lot of time slowly revealing the lives of David and his precious little girl. As a father, I felt a connection with David. Nothing and no one is more important than your child. David was a noble character with the best of intentions and a few dark secrets that he tries to hide.What really pulled me into the story from the start was the manner by which the author presented his story. It starts out with David and Ellie on the run, then I was smacked with one of those \u201cWhat? What? What?\u201d moments. This was followed by a flashback revealing the events that lead to David running. The story continues like this, back and forth. I loved the slow striptease of what had happened, there was a slow, deliberate revealing of what had happened to create this gripping adventure.The Night Parade is an apocalypse like no other. It is a story that pulled me in, shocked me and really made me question \u201cWhat if?\u201d I became at one with David, what happened to him, happened to me.

Then the madness began . . .A building sense of foreboding. Something has happened, is happening.It's an amazing feeling when you start a new book by a capable writer. one who gently takes you by the hand and guides you on your journey. Ronald Malfi is such a writer.Malfi is a master at giving the reader just enough to draw you into his world and then slowly reveals bits and pieces until it all comes together. Much like painter creating a work of art by adding layer after layer until the piece is just right.There is a new plague in the land. Wanderer's Folly, which results in nosebleeds, hallucinations, and ultimately death. No one knows the cause or even how the disease is transmitted. There is no cure. Some regions are devastated and others are barely affected. David Arden and his soon to be nine-year-old daughter, Ellie are on the run. You see, Ellie is special, not only is she immune, but she's exhibiting other talents. Talents which may be a result of her immunity or the reason for it. And, of course, the government wants to know more.The dialog in The Night Parade is brisk and delightfully refreshing.I generally don't enjoy stories with flashbacks, but I found Malfi's use of the technique to be effective and useful in filling in the gaps of the events which lead to David and Ellie's current situation. One such flashback featured the tale of a Freez-E-Friend truck pulling up in the Arden's cul de sac, at one in the morning, in the dead of winter.The reveal of the story behind the book's title was charming and effective.The Night Parade has a creepy vibe and some genuinely terrifying moments. I even teared up a time or two. It's everything I look for in a great read.Highly recommended.Published by Kensington Press, The Night Parade is available in paperback, e-book, and audio formats.Ronald Damien Malfi was born in Brooklyn, New York and spent most of his childhood growing up along the Chesapeake Bay.

No one knows how it\u2019s spread or why some contract it while others don\u2019t, but one thing is certain\u2014it\u2019s getting worse.It\u2019s a story that\u2019s been told before, but as with all familiar tropes of fiction, it is the author\u2019s voice that provides the melody over these familiar chords that make it something new, something special. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of Malfi since reading his novel, Snow, and that awe, that amazement over his talent I felt then grows with each novel. The Night Parade is another fine example of his incomparable grasp on storytelling.This is a beautiful story of a man named David, and his daughter, Ellie, as they struggle with all that has just happened in their world. David has lost his wife and knows that he must do whatever he can to keep his daughter safe. Escaping into the night, they hit the highway, leaving what\u2019s left of their quarantined town behind.I\u2019m not going to tell you the story. I want you to enjoy the ride yourself. Let me just say that Malfi\u2019s ability to craft these amazing stories and characters in such tight fashion, where you breeze through nearly four-hundred pages like it was a two-hundred-page book is astonishing and wonderful. You don\u2019t want it to end. You want it to stay a little longer, to linger, so you can wrap up in the magic and keep the cold, harsh world at bay. Yeah, even if the story is about a deadly plague. That\u2019s a testament to how good this guys is.I loved this book. Definitely in my Top 5 of 2016.I give The Night Parade 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Zuky the BookBum", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37830213-zuky-the-bookbum", "userReview": "[Plot hole.

His newest novel is no different. Set in a post-apocalyptic America a father and his eight year-old daughter are on the run from the CDC who wants to use his immune little one to cure a fatal disease. A sort of a road trip gone bad where more than half of the population is dead and what\u2019s left has either one foot in the grave or has taken the law into its own hands. In between many encounters with the bad guys you get flashbacks, impressive dialogue, emotional moments, and a dozy of an ending that will leave no reader unfazed.THE NIGHT PARADE (Kensington) is a cross between King\u2019s THE STAND, FIRESTARTER and even the less-compelling DREAMCATCHER. But don\u2019t let the comparison fool you. This is a highly-effective horror/drama/thriller that never loses steam and is as rewarding as any work from the Maine man. Malfi is comfortable behind his plume and it shows. His narrative, as his characterization, feels fresh, secure, but most importantly, addictive. Literary even comes to mind; so much so that the action almost becomes secondary; but not quite since everything is so well-paced. Sure, the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu regarding the plot is there but the author is more than talented enough to add another layer to the end-of-the-world sagas, one that will please many fans of the sub-genre. And who says one cannot dabble into already explored areas? As long as it\u2019s well-made and rewarding and has a strong comeback flavour to it there\u2019s definitely nothing wrong with it, is there? So go on, pick up THE NIGHT PARADE. You\u2019ll thank me later.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the chance to read this novel in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Angela Crawford", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30952275-angela-crawford", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This is in no way reflected in my opinion of this novel. The Night Parade is reminiscent of books like Firestarter and The Road. Malfi skillfully weaves through the past and the present to tell the story of not only David and Ellie but also how Wanderers Folly has brought about the end of life as we know it. There are moments of sheer terror lurking in these pages, as well as moments that will break your heart as David struggles to keep his daughter safe. This is a tale that gets under your skin, and makes you question what would you do if it were your family. As a parent, I totally understood why David did the things he did to protect Ellie, I may have done the same if I were in this apocalyptic nightmare with my child. I highly recommend this gripping 4.5 star read."}, {"userName": "Maxine Marsh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4886804-maxine-marsh", "userReview": "The Night Parade is a surprisingly moving story about a father and daughter on the run in a quickly disintegrating, plagued America. The story unfold slowly, switching from present time with David and Ellie facing an unknown and sick world and David's flashbacks, leading up to some intense reveals towards the end of the book. There is plenty of horror in this one, people good and bad, nature gone wrong and a disease that causes people to hallucinate, commit suicide and sleep walk. The only downside is that the beginning of the novel is rather slow. After about the first third, though, the story picks up.I'm actually hoping there's a sequel to this one some day.

Though the basic concept is the same - Father-daughter duo fighting and running from the world because of the daughter's supernatural ability, this book was different in its own way. In this book, for one, the father did not possess supernatural abilities. This really made things different, though the main conflict of the father was that he did not have enough\u00a0time (just like in Firestarter.) The one thing that made this book entirely different from Firestarter is the main backdrop and the central theme - The apocalypse,\u00a0a world falling prey to an unidentified and seemingly incurable plague. Though I do feel that this book is kind of a homage to Mr King's masterpiece.The best part of the book was the conflicts, both inner and outer. I liked the characters of David and Ellie and rooted for them both till the very end. The buildup was very good and the ending was reasonable, though I did see it coming, because really, how could a book like this end? Still, I felt like I was sucker punched in the belly.The alternating timelines added a lot to the suspense buildup and, overall I really liked this book. In spite of being almost 400 pages, it proved to be a quick read because of the high tension that was maintained throughout the book.I'd recommend this book to every dystopian fan, though sci-fi and apocalyptic lovers might find this book a bit \"low-key\" as compared to the action-packed drama we normally expect from these genres.You can also read this review at \nThe Reading Bud"}, {"userName": "Shorty", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3347032-shorty", "userReview": "Holy crap this book is good! I just finished the audiobook and all I can think of is WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT...??? Ugh, this book is wonderfully written. Great characters, a fantastic storyline that's very intense and eerie, and I just couldn't wait to get back to it. If I hadn't read a blurb of Steven King saying how he loved this book, I might not have stumbled across it any time soon. And for this, I am eternally grateful. Because this is one author that lovers of horror should really keep their eye on!Yes, it's a mix of Firestarter and the Road, but it's so much more. And literally one of the best novels I've read this year. I'm SO glad I own it on audiobook form, and it's rare that I ever say this...! I just wish so bad that there was mooooorrrrre, I really need to know what happens next....!!!!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dOh yeah, Tom Taylorson narrated his heart out on the audiobook, and he was pretty darn good.

David Arlen, his wife Kathy, and young daughter, Ellie, seem to be okay, even as many friends and colleagues take ill with what's been dubbed as Wanderer's Folly. In fact, Kathy may be immune, as well as their daughter. And the CDC wants to test Kathy, and eventually, Ellie. They may hold the key to a cure.But when the rigorous testing takes its toll and Kathy dies, David flees with his daughter, on a nightmare run from authorities, and into a world crumbling around them.His only hope is to reach his stepbrother, who may be able to grant them shelter...but David might be sick himself. And should he keep his miraculous daughter, who appears to possess a unique and deadly ability because of her immunity, from those who could end the apocalyptic disease? But at what cost?

There is a certain similarity between Robert McCammons\u00a0 Swan Song where \"Swan\" Sue Wanda is hoping to create a better world from the ashes Armageddon.\u00a0David Arlen and his daughter Ellie are fleeing across a disease ridden America, their destination the home and hopefully security of his half brother Tim. Wanderer's Folly is a fatal condition that attacks the brain, causing hallucinations where the recipient coughs up blood before collapsing on the ground in a series of convulsions. David's wife Kathy, although immune to the disease, was incarcerated in an attempt to discover the source of this immunity. She was cruelly exploited resulting in her ultimate death from the \"folly\" and now the race is on to capture, imprison and experiment Ellie who has inherited the same immunity...\"They're not looking for me, baby\". he said. \"They're looking for you. That special thing about your mom that one-ina-trillion resistance she had against the disease that made her immune...you've got it, too. It's in you, too. You're immune, Ellie.\"\u00a0Ronald Malfi's writing is really an analysis of the human condition; what binds us together; what sets us apart as humans; He is a great believer in the human emotions of love, needs and wants. He is a true supporter of the family unit, the love that exists between a husband and wife and the unbreakable bonds between a child and its parents. The Night Parade is an apocalyptic story with few wasted words, an exciting tale of an adventure that is doomed never to have a happy ending but one that will make you both sad and smile as one little girl reaches out to grasp her ultimate destiny."}, {"userName": "Teri", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4989035-teri", "userReview": "I'm a fan of apocalyptic novels, and that probably started with Stephen King's The Stand, so the book description and the fact that it's labeled as horror - along with the fantastic cover - made me want to read this novel. And it didn't disappoint.As a parent, I could identify with David's need and overpowering urgency to protect his daughter and attempts to shelter her from the horrors around them; however, David is definitely not a person I'd like to be on the run with. He makes so many mistakes with regards to their whereabouts and wastes money on such frivolous things, that I was cringing and shaking my head in several spots. Ellie is intuitive, mature, and wise beyond her years and makes several thought-provoking points regarding humanity and responsibility. I liked the way the author gradually reveals the backstory, alternating between past and present in several chapters. There are many macabre visuals - people wearing Halloween and paper plate masks, the hallucinations and physical symptoms the infected people experienced. And some of the characters - the ice cream man and that weird backroads family in Kentucky - make for some morbidly suspenseful scenes.Personally, I would have liked to learn more about Ellie, but with the ending, I have to wonder if the author is considering a sequel. If so, I'd love to read it.The Night Parade isn't a gory-type of horror novel - it's a story with a dark tone that inspires feelings of hopelessness and anxiety in the reader and I found it difficult to put it down.Thanks to NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kevin Lucia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1449299-kevin-lucia", "userReview": "Amazing, as always.
