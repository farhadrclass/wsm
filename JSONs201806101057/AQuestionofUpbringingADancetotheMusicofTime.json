It is too early to say how I will feel as I am dragged along and try to keep my steps in measure. The Dance cannot be evaluated yet and this first walk has not had enough time to developed into a courante either.Nothing much has happened. We are at the infancy of the Dance. Or may be not quite so. It is youth really: Public school, plus s\u00e9jour en France, plus Going Up to university. But there is already a plethora of characters that will soon make me hold on to the barre and find support with Invitation To The Dance if I want to keep my reading muscles flexible.What is most extraordinary to me is how strongly I feel the pull when I do not know yet the direction, as if my reading were done in the dark with a series of glowworms as speckles of enigmas paving the path for my feet and eyes to follow and pursue.Premonitions of things to come... and the Dance continues with the beat of those textual riddles."}, {"userName": "Lizzy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30575403-lizzy", "userReview": "What did I expect when I start reading Anthony Powell\u2019s A Question of Upbringing? I might have expected a historical fiction, a memoir or even the beginning of an epic story that would capture my attention mercilessly. What I did find was a coming of age story with a beautiful and flowing narration that concentrates on relationships and personalities but with no marked plot. There is no tension, nothing to be solved and therefore no resolution. Was the lack of a plot that failed to attract me? No, I don\u2019t think that was it. I have loved reading many books that lack it. I did keep expecting, it's true, some major event to give a point to the book but it failed to come. Isn't life like that most of the time? Nevertheless, thinking it over, my lack of enthusiasm I imagine was due to the fact that I could not relate to Powell\u2019s characters and could not identify with them.In this first installment of The Dance to the Music of Time we are introduced to Nick Jenkins, Charles Stringham, Peter Templer, and Kenneth Widmerpool. These four young men, schoolmates in public school and later Oxford, will changes as the Powell moves on in time. Despite feeling basically let down, I enjoyed Powell\u2019s prose. From the opening we can envisage the quality of his writing:\nThe image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure: stepping slowly, methodically, sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognizable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.\nWhen telling us about his characters school years, \nEmotional intensity seemed to meet and mingle with an air of indifference, even of cruelty within these ancient walls. Youth and Time here had made, as it were, some compromise.\nWe start to recognize how Jenkins considers his friends:\nAs I came gradually to know them better, I saw that, in reality, Stringham and Templer provided, in their respective methods of approaching life, patterns of two very distinguishable forms of existence, each of which deserved consideration in the light of its own special peculiarities: both, at the same time, demanding adjustment of a scale of values that was slowly taking coherent shape so far as my own canons of behaviour were concerned.\nWhat I especially sensed is how the narrator Jenkins seems to be maturing in front of our eyes, although at times he comes through as exceedingly naive. This certainly is to be expected. When he is contemplating his relationships to his friends:\nClearly some complicated process of sorting-out was in progress among those who surrounded me: though only years later did I become aware how early such voluntary segregations begin to develop; and of how they continue throughout life.\nWhen Jerkins is sojourning in France, where he meets Widmerpool, again we read how he comments on something that only later would reveal itself to him. It seems Powell is preparing us for later:\nLater in life, I learned that many things one may require have to be weighed against one\u2019s dignity, which can be an insuperable barrier against advancement in almost any direction. However, in those days, choice between dignity and unsatisfied curiosity, was less clear to me as a cruel decision that had to be made.\nOr when facing his first romance:\n\u2026partly at that age I was not yet old enough to be aware of the immense rage that can be secreted in the human heart by cumulative minor irritation.That was when I began to suspect that being in love might be a complicated affair.I was, however, struck by the reflection that undoubted inconvenience was threatened if this apparently recurrent malady of the heart was to repeat itself throughout life, with the almost dizzy reiteration that had now begun to seem unavoidable.\nThe passages above are a taste of why I liked A Question of Upbringing, and the reason for my rating despite my misgivings and lack of deeper feelings for his characters. Powell\u2019s beautiful prose makes reading it a very enjoyable experience. Now to the second volume of his A Dance to the Music of Time, hoping that as his characters mature I will enjoy it better."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Viewed from afar, Anthony Powell\u2019s 167-volume A Dance to the Music of Time appears as one of the Alps of 20th century fiction. You are daunted by its crags. My goodness, a 167-novel sequence stretching over 89 years! It\u2019s some achievement. But when you find yourself in possession of the first volume, a fun-sized 230 pages, disconcerted and relieved, you realise that this is nothing more than a leisurely afternoon stroll through the early years of a young toff and his posh mates, firstly in the last year of school and then the first year of university. It is no Alp at all. This is familiar territory \u2013 Mr Powell is surely Evelyn Waugh\u2019s twin brother. Mr Powell writes ponderous, clausey sentences which have pleasing bends and graceful arcs. He is like a great swan gliding upon the English language, feathers never to be ruffled. The acknowledged musicality of the prose makes this a symphony of snobbery with violins. The song he sings is of the English upper class and how they run everything. How their etiolated scions lounge through school (meaning the fearfully expensive public schools of England, like Eton, where many of the current Tory cabinet were educated), putz around in the colonies patronising the natives and the colonists (you could call it a gap year), then saunter along to put in a spell up at Oxford or Cambridge (there are no other universities for this crowd) until some family acquaintance shimmies them into a middling job in the City. We observe through the eyes of Jenkins three or four of these toffs. At Eton, as 16/17 year olds, they talk pompously and preposterously to each other like this:But my dear Peter, why do you always go about dressed as if you were going to dance up and down a row of naked ladies singing \u201cDapper Dan was a very handy man\u201d or something equally lyrical? You get more like an advertisement for gents\u2019 tailoring every day.But usually not so entertainingly.The book is in three sections \u2013 school, my holiday in France, and my university days. The French episode, lasting 60 pages, brought me close to despair. It was beyond dire. At the French pension various minor characters got to do footling things to each other. Many pages were spent on a tennis match between two Scandinavians. One won by utilising a drop shot which was considered ungentlemanly by the other. I have been more entertained opening unsolicited junk mail. Throughout the novel minor characters swirl in and out, and each get the Powell introductory treatment.\u2026shaking from his round, somewhat pasty face a brownish, uneven fringe that grew low on his forehead and made him look rather like a rag doll, or marionette; an air augmented by brown eyes like beads, and a sprinkling of freckles. His tie, a broad, loose knot, left the collar of his shirt a little open. andThe American, Honthorst\u2019s, hair was almost as uncontrolled as that of Members. It stood up on the top of his head like the comb, or crest, of a hoopoe, or cassowary; this bird-like appearance being increased by a long, bare neck, ending in a white collar cut drastically lowWell - if I am to suffer through endless introductions to and descriptions of minor characters you will forgive me if I ask if there is likely to be a point to their presence, more than just filling up the room, like furniture. Perhaps the point will be encountered in Book 43 or Book 77 of the series, by more determined readers than I. If so, hapless is the reader of volume one, meeting and greeting one character after another who then does nothing. Jenkins, the narrator, endlessly contemplates the precise class relations and characters of his few acquaintances and their exact degrees of regard for each otherIt was possible that, in the eyes of Quiggin, money represented some element in which he knew himself deficient : rather in the same way that Widmerpool, when he wanted to criticise Stringham, said that he had too much money; no doubt in truth envying the possession of assets that were, in fact, not material ones. But why all this may be of interest to the reader is not clear. I must confess that the warm appreciation this novel inspires mystifies me. some very funny incidents made me burst out laughing. (Goodreads)It is quite fascinating and, oh, so skillfully crafted, often with dry and understated wit. (Goodreads)A very entertaining and enjoyable read, but not purely fluff and insignificance, as the psychological insights are acute and revealing (Goodreads)Subtle, witty and immensely entertaining. I started to affix post-it notes to mark favourite passages, but there were so many I finally gave this up. (Goodreads)Intensely enjoyable \u2013 his dry, ironic descriptions are very funny indeed (The Observer)I would rather read Mr Powell than any English novelist now writing (Kingsley Amis)Tedious and overpraised (Auberon Waugh \u2013 oops!) It\u2019s possible that a steady diet of Breaking Bad, Walking Dead,  Richard Price police procedurals, Cormac McCarthy and true crime has dulled my senses to the point where a series of diffident reflections on the interpersonal relations of several assorted rich British men from the early 1920s fails to completely engage my attention with its subtlety and understated humour. But no \u2013 I\u2019ll have none of that - for the most part this was excruciatingly dull.

The book that you pretend to be illuminating will usually be either 1) too old to require your late-blooming insights or else 2) too new to be obscure, because the atmosphere of publicity which surrounds all new books these days will have beaten you to the punch by a mile or more. When we click on a book link on this website, or when we look up a title in a search, our main purpose is never to find out the plot (Wiki for that), nor is it our goal to read your slipshod bio of the author (Amazon for that). Give us something fresh about the book, or just give it the stars it deserves. As a humble contribution to what Robert Conquest has described as the UFABS (United Front Against Bullshit), this review is an attempt to get us moving in the right direction, toward reviews that are something more than disjointed or (what\u2019s worse) redundant parrot squawks masquerading as erudition.Up until now, the reviews of this book have followed one or both of the distressing patterns referenced above. Now we didn\u2019t even need one Goodreads member to note that this is the first of a 12-volume sequence. So why do all of the reviewers state this incessantly. I mean why do they do that anyway? I mean why? Eh?Nowhere would an attempt to appreciate a book merely in terms of its plot be less appropriate than in the case of A Question of Upbringing. I loved the book. Anthony Powell writes beautifully. The narrator Jenkins (who oversees all 12 novels) is barely there, and because his experiences are almost always related indirectly through his dialogue with others, it is entirely possible to read the whole novel without much thinking of him as one of the main characters. However, his presence is also just palpable enough to be sympathetic. This approach could have easily lurched into a kind of pseudo-third-person omniscience, but it never does. Another danger would have been for the book to go stream-of-consciousness on us. But Powell avoids both of these traps through his light but expert management of the details of Jenkins\u2019 private emotions. Jenkins never overstates his grasp of the events he is witnessing. And when Jenkins speaks to another character, Powell has the uncanny knack of seeming to take the words right out of the minds of his readers and to put them in the mouth of Jenkins. Jenkins speaks for us, and he does so with enormous credibility.In a book that is built so tightly and minutely upon such an introspective character, it would have been easy for Powell to lose control of the story, and tempting for him to go slipping and tripping into the slough of solipsism that so often characterizes Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison and many other writers who love to stay inside the minds of their protagonists. Instead of all that, Powell gives Jenkins a voice that is strengthened by the authority of looking backward many years (when he\u2019s addressing the reader), as well as the refreshing sincerity of the ing\u00e9nue (when he\u2019s addressing his friends and acquaintances). Jenkins\u2019 nostalgic descriptions of school, of the summer in France and of the visits to the homes of schoolmates are registered so well that they could easily have crowded out the details of the characters moving through them. But Powell reminds the reader occasionally, and gently, that Jenkins actually knew and interacted with the characters around him, while he was mainly standing to the side and observing shrewdly. Powell weaves the two moods of Jenkins (in dialogue and in a sort of diary mode) so nimbly that one grows to love the hero without his ever really doing anything notable in the book. It\u2019s not at all surprising, then, that I identify so completely and happily with Jenkins myself."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "A Question of Upbringing is unobtrusively and agreeably grotesque.

Also mentioned is a slightly odd character, named Widmerpool, who Jenkins meets up again later in the book, when he visits France to improve his language skills. Although Widmerpool is identified as a figure of fun, Jenkins later reappraises his attitude slightly and it is demonstrated that he has both ambition and a strong will to succeed.Obviously, this first novel \u2013 the first in a three book sequence linked to the seasons as \u2018Spring\u2019 \u2013 is very much an introduction.

Or maybe, you like it so much that it reminds you of a song and you keep on humming or singing lines from that song. Or maybe, you like it so much that you are inspired to write poems or stories that the painting, sculpture or photograph reminded you of.Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665), a French painter in a classical style painting inspired Anthony Powell (1905-2000) to write a 12-volume book , one of the longest works of fiction in literature, entitled \nA Dance to the Music of Time.\n The 12 volumes were published as individual books between 1951-1975 to critical acclaim. Powell did not write any other novels. He wrote other works like his memoirs, bibliographies, plays and essays but no other novel although I am sure he has the time and imagination to think of other stories and I am sure people would be patronizing them. No, he chose to stick with the plot of this story. It was as if he dedicated all his life to this. Imagining the Poussin\u2019s painting. Being inspired by it. All his life.This is how Poussin's painting looks like:\n\n I read and finished the first volume, A Question of Upbringing last weekend. The setting is in an all-boys school in England.

The scenes are sometimes funny (the one with the flying banana made me chuckled), sometimes insightful, sometime heartwarming, sometimes naughty (coming-of-age naughtiness) but almost always a joy to read. It seems to tell us about how to grow up as men and I suspect that the rest of the 11 books will trace these men\u2019s lives to their mature age. So, the dance is like a dance of life and the music changes as time passes. There are some terms and phrases that I do not understand as English is not my first language and I forgot to bring a dictionary during our weekend out-of-the-city trip so I just went on reading.

I wanted to rate this with a 5 stars but I think it is too early to conclude of its magnificence. I am giving this a conservative 3 stars and see how the rest of the 11 books fare. It is better to start with a low rating (so my hope is not that high) and end up with a higher one (towards the end of the series) so as not to be disappointed.

Some other characters are also introduced in the narrative: Uncle Giles, Sillery, Buster, Sunny Farebrother and Widmerpool.Even if some readers eventually compare with \u201cRemembrance of the Lost Time\u201d by Marcel Proust, it seems to me more similar to \u201cJean-Christophe\u201d written by Romain Rolland. To be checked in the following volumes.This book is being discussed in the GR group 2016: A Dance to the Music of Time. A Dance to the Music of Time, Nicolas Poussin, 1634-1635, The Wallace Collection, London.At the start of Anthony Powell's series of novels named after the painting the narrator, Nicolas Jenkins, reflects on it in the first two pages of A Question of Upbringing:These classical projections, and something from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin's scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure, stepping slowly, methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.From Wiki:Published in 1951, it begins the story of a trio of boys, Nicholas Jenkins (the narrator), Charles Stringham, and Peter Templer, who are friends at a nameless school (based upon Powell's public school Eton College) and then move on to different paths. A fourth figure, Kenneth Widmerpool, stands slightly apart from them, poised for greatness.The novel is concerned with the flow and transience of life and the play of time upon love and friendship. Another major theme introduced in A Question of Upbringing is the consequence of living by the will.In presenting four very different characters - \"the artist, the romantic, the cynic, and the man of will\" - the author sets the scene for an extended exploration of what it means to grow and mature. The language of youth, deployed with precision, is used to depict the emergence of the boys into manhood in a period when memories of the Great War overshadow many of their elders.The title of the book had its origin in an incident in which Powell was a passenger in a car driven by his friend, the Old Etonian screenwriter, Thomas Wilton (\"Tommy\") Phipps. Phipps and Powell found themselves driving straight towards an oncoming vehicle. Powell later recorded, \"Seizing the hand-brake as we sped towards what seemed imminent collision, Phipps muttered to himself, 'This is just going to be a question of upbringing.\u2019\u201dThe website of the Anthony Powell Society is also an excellent source of more information about Powell and Dance."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2330809-steve", "userReview": "What a strange, yet pleasant distraction....I recently found this on a literary reading list - frankly, I'd never heard of it before. I guess that's not surprising, since the series was not, apparently (until the e-book/Kindle era), previously marketed to American (U.S.) readers. The University of Chicago - not the most mainstream of literary publishing houses - rolled it out on e-book/Kindle for folks on our side of the pond - and, well, I'm glad they did.Powell writes beautifully (so, at least to my mind, his reputation is well deserved and his prowess on full display here). It's leisurely, but elegant prose. At least so far, the action - to the extent there is any - proceeds at a walking pace. Our narrator attends a boarding school in England, after World War I, then he heads to France to practice his French, then he begins at University ... and, well, that's about it. (Apparently, by the time we get to the next book, our narrator is off to London, but time will tell.) We meet characters, we observe social situations, we ponder questions, we have limited recognition of how parochial our perceptions might be ... and then we move on. Given how little occurs, I'm at a loss to explain how or why I found this so entertaining. There's an element of Jane Austen observing and critiquing the drawing room or the absurdity of formal (or polite) conversation that's in play here, although there's far less of a contained story or vignette playing out and, at least so far, there's no romantic object, pursuit, capture, and resolution. But the jaundiced eye and rapier wit is analogous (even if the number of laugh-out-loud moments are fewer). If it were non-fiction, it might be dismissed as a rambling, poorly organized journal. But ... but...As I now understand it, the combined work spans twelve books written over a couple of decades, beginning in 1951 and spanning a generation of ... life(?). I have no idea how many I'll eventually read, but I enjoyed the first one enough that I'm confident I'll progress to the second."}, {"userName": "Nigeyb", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb", "userReview": "A Question of Upbringing by Anthony Powell\"A Dance to the Music of Time\" is a twelve-volume cycle of novels by Anthony Powell, and \"A Question of Upbringing\" is the first of the twelve volumes.I've wanted to read \"A Dance to the Music of Time\" since discovering that Julian Maclaren-Ross features somewhere in the series as a character called X. Trapnel. Such is my interest in Julian Maclaren-Ross (I am, of course, assuming you have already read \"Fear and Loathing in Fitzrovia: The Bizarre Life of Writer, Actor, Soho Raconteur Julian Maclaren-Ross\" by Paul Willetts) that this is sufficient to inspire me to tackle one of the longest works of fiction in English literature. You probably feel exactly the same. If you don't then you should consider it.Published in 1951, \"A Question of Upbringing\" is the reminiscences of Nick Jenkins (presumably based on Powell himself) who recounts his last few years at public school around 1921, a summer spent in France, and then onto university. It's a familiar world of gilded privilege, akin to the early sections of \"Brideshead Revisited\", though with very little by way of drama or narrative. Instead the reader is introduced to a variety of disparate characters and some prescient anecdotes. I say prescient as Jenkins hints at the ways in which their lives will turn out.What makes this book a delight is the beautiful writing, which really captures the era and milieu, and which is aligned to regular doses of humour. Powell captures the transition of adolescence into adulthood perfectly: the insecurities, the naivety, the fast changes, the gaucheness, the way friendships may evolve and fracture, and how life choices made at this stage can shape whole lives.I suspect this series will get better and better and \"A Question of Upbringing\" lays the groundwork for what it is to follow. I cannot wait to find out.4/5I have subsequently read the next two volumes:Click here to see my review of A Buyer's Market (A Dance to the Music of Time #2)Click here to see my review of The Acceptance World (A Dance to the Music of Time #3)The twelve books of \"A Dance to the Music of Time\" are available individually or as four volumes.SpringA Question of Upbringing \u2013 (1951)A Buyer's Market \u2013 (1952)The Acceptance World \u2013 (1955)SummerAt Lady Molly's \u2013 (1957)Casanova's Chinese Restaurant \u2013 (1960)The Kindly Ones \u2013 (1962)AutumnThe Valley of Bones \u2013 (1964)The Soldier's Art \u2013 (1966)The Military Philosophers \u2013 (1968)WinterBooks Do Furnish a Room \u2013 (1971)Temporary Kings \u2013 (1973)Hearing Secret Harmonies \u2013 (1975)(dates are first UK publication dates)"}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "How delightful has been my return to this charming and fascinating series of twelve novels. I am reminded of how leisurely and flowing is Powell\u2019s writing, how he concentrates on personalities and relationships, and how little there is of any marked plot - no particular tension, no \u201cproblem\u201d to be solved, no crisis or denouement, no resolution. Life in his works just moves on and on, and reading them is relaxing yet both intriguing and even engrossing. What lovely writing, above all; I like his syntax and vocabulary. English writing pleases me, for the most part.Nick Jenkins, as narrator, successfully keeps the focus relatively away from himself without in any way hiding his own thoughts and reactions to life as he lives it. Powell, by contrast, is little in evidence. His characters, though, are clearly and individual delineated, if only gradually and through Nick\u2019s eyes; it is an intriguing technique and process, one that unfolds bit by bit, revealing and creating dimensions unsuspected initially, highly effective. This first of twelve novels in the series focuses on Nick\u2019s life in school up to and including his first year at university during what would seem to be the 1920\u2018s. Three of his friends or acquaintances weave in and out of his narrative - Charles Stringham, Peter Templer, and Kenneth Widmerpool. The narrative seems primarily Nick\u2019s memories, his reminiscences about them and others, about the continual changes and developments in personalities, relationships, and circumstances over time, all consistent with the overall title of the series, A Dance to the Music of Time. The writing is magnificent, both sensitive and nuanced; one is always aware of what, during conversations, is being left unsaid, of the subtle shifts of motivation and emotion, of the changing tides of interpersonal interaction. It is quite fascinating and, oh, so skillfully crafted, often with dry and understated wit.As this first novel draws to a close, we are left, as is Nick, with the realization of relationships drawing to an end, of friendships drifting apart, of new paths being taken. Early in the book we were briefly introduced to Nick\u2019s enigmatic ne\u2019r-do-well Uncle Giles, whose story pops up occasionally during the book; on the final page Nick and Uncle Giles meet again in a cheap restaurant, their conversation reprising itself, drawing the novel itself to a finish."}, {"userName": "Paola", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8934711-paola", "userReview": "Just the beginning of the 12 part saga describing England in the first half of the century just gone, and I am already enjoying it.

Oft ist das Gesamtwerk mit dem \u00fcbergreifenden Titel EIN TANZ ZUR MUSIK DER ZEIT mit den gro\u00dfen Romanprojekten des 20. Jahrhunderts, vor allem mit Prousts RECHERCHE, verglichen worden. Ich denke, dass der Vergleich vor allem diesem ersten Band eher schadet als nutzt, denn EINE FRAGE DER ERZIEHUNG liest sich kurzweilig und angenehm, erweckt aber \u00fcberhaupt nicht den Eindruck der Vielschichtigkeit und des Reflektionsgrades, mit dem die RECHERCHE von Beginn an brilliert.Der Ich-Erz\u00e4hler Jenkins berichtet hier von seinen letzten Schul- und den darauffolgenden Universit\u00e4tsjahren sowie einem Sprachurlaub in Frankreich. Die als legend\u00e4r geschilderten Streiche rufen beim heutigen Leser wohl eher ein mildes Achselzucken hervor als wirkliche Betroffenheit oder Gel\u00e4chter, und die durchaus genauen Beobachtungen, die Jenkins anstellt, befassen sich ausschlie\u00dflich mit der Frage des gesellschaftlichen Status, den die Personen inne haben.Dieser Blick, den Jenkins auf sein soziales Umfeld wirft, ist extrem britisch und geht von einem festgef\u00fcgten Gesellschaftssystem aus, in dem Familie, Verm\u00f6gen, Herkunft und Ansehen die Existenz bestimmen. Ordnung und Stabilit\u00e4t erscheinen als Werte, von denen man sich nicht vorzustellen vermag, dass der n\u00e4chste Weltkrieg sie in Frage stellen wird.Abgesehen von der Schilderung des Werdeganges, den seine Schul- und Studienfreunde (voraussichtlich) nehmen werden, gibt es auch Phasen der Verliebtheit, die Jenkins beschreibt. Doch seltsam k\u00fchl bleibt der erz\u00e4hlerische Blick, den er auf Jean und Suzette wirft, und man k\u00f6nnte meinen, dass Leidenschaft m\u00f6glicherweise kein typisches Charaktermerkmal des Upperclass-Engl\u00e4nders w\u00e4re. Und als ich die letzte Seite gelesen habe, f\u00e4llt mir auf: Ich habe \u00fcber sehr viele Personen etwas erfahren, aber am allerwenigsten \u00fcber Jenkins selbst.EINE FRAGE DER ERZIEHUNG ist kein Auftakt zu einem Gro\u00dfwerk, der mich gleich v\u00f6llig mit- und umgerissen hat, aber es steckt gewiss viel Potenzial darin und ich bin gespannt, wie sich das Romanwerk weiter entwickeln wird."}, {"userName": "Carlo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-carlo", "userReview": "The ending of this book seemed to me like a metaphor for the complete work and possibly the series as far as it can be guessed. As with the best works in literature, I can't possibly be spoiling it for you by telling you about it, so please do read on.Jenkins goes to see Stringham in London but the latter disappoints him when he says that he has to go to a party which \"can hardly fail to be rather fun.\" Jenkins tells him not to worry though he gets annoyed at this treatment. He decides to go to the Trouville restaurant to see his uncle Giles who dines there every night, and you get the sense that this turn of events is preparing for something remarkable to happen with Giles, and that this encounter will be explored in the next book, and Powell is just trying to build some tension for you to read on. However, the book ends with the following beautiful paragraph:'Within, the room was narrow, and unnaturally long, with a table each side, one after another, stretching in perspective into shadows that hid the service lift: which was set among palms rising from ornate brass pots. The emptiness, dim light, silence \u2013 and, to some extent, the smell \u2013 created a faintly ecclesiastical atmosphere; so that the track between the tables might have been an aisle, leading, perhaps, to a hidden choir. Uncle Giles himself, sitting alone at the far end of this place, bent over a book, had the air of a sleepy worshipper, waiting for the next service to begin. He did not look specially pleased to see me, and not at all surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit late,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I started.\u201d It had not occurred to him that I should do otherwise than come straight up to London, so soon as informed that there was an opportunity to see him again. He put his book face-downwards on the tablecloth. I saw that it was called Some Things That Matter. We discussed the Trust until it was time to catch my train.'I was not at all disappointed.

I'm usually not very good at retaining the details of books for much more than a month or two, unless I've been writing about them; with QU, I remember pretty much everything, so adept is Powell at creating memorable and charming characters with just a few sentences. Nothing much 'happens' here, of course, which is hardly surprising, since not much happens in the first 8.25% of most novels, but Powell does lay substantial groundwork aside from the basics of his characters (particularly Widmerpool). First, the 'musical' structure of the book gets off to a nice start. Although this should technically just be the first statement of the theme, QU has a mini-sonata form of its own, beginning with Widmerpool and Jenkins, ending with a second-hand report of Widmerpool and more Jenkins, with some variations in between. The obvious touchstones (positive or negative) are cheekily dealt with, too: the notably Forsytian Jenkins is connected to an actual line of Galsworthy, and there's a blatantly Proustian feel to chapter three (first love and its after-images, French country-house stylings). I can also suggest that prospective readers of DMT read Carpenter's 'The Brideshead Generation,' which sets you up nicely for the school and university scenes here."}, {"userName": "Eleanor", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21865425-eleanor", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book very much and have now moved on to the second volume of A Dance to the Music of Time.

My first reading of this first book in the sequence was very disappointing; the very few characters that I most identified with seemed to be those most mocked by the author.

After speeding through St Aubyn's Patrick Melrose novels and enjoying them, I thought that I should give the Powell sequence, which the Melrose novels were constantly compared to, a second chance.A Question of Upbringing hasn't annoyed me so much this time. As another reviewer has said, it feels more like some introductory chapters to a larger book than a novel in its own right. It contains nothing in the way of plot, just a series of character sketches. I did keep expecting some major event to give a point to the book but it failed to come. The first of the Melrose novels, Never Mind, also seems to meander until one moment, and this then reverberates through the rest of the books.I will continue to book 2, which is more than I managed last time.

Waugh had a gift for conciseness - in contrast Powell is far more languid - but both styles are masterly. I'm pleased to have read recently that Waugh greatly admired Powell, who must be one of the most underrated writers of the 20th century.This volume, published in 1951, deals with the schooldays of the four boys whos lives dominate the entire series. First, there is Nicholas Jenkins, the narrator, who is the alter-ego of Powell and who is artistically inclined.
