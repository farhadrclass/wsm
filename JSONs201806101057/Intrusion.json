Individual rights (e.g. women's rights) have been subsumed into the rights of society to make the right choices for people (with in particular control of pregnancy and even pre-pregnancy effectively turning women back into domestic slaves with intrusive monitoring of their health and lifestyle choices) and free market doctrines replaced by a doctrine of society deciding the choice people would make if they were fully informed and acting rationally. Hope is pregnant with her second child and (as with the first) refuses to take the fix, a pill which effectively corrects any genetic defects in a baby including conferring immunity from most infections. A recent legal case means that this, without a faith objection which the militantly atheist Hope refuses to claim, is close to illegal. Her case is taken up by a journalist and social campaigner and this starts to trigger police surveillance and this together with her refusal to take the fix (but never explicitly due to that) leads her to fear she will be declared an unfit mother and flee with her husband to his Scottish Island home. Her husband (and his father and their young son) all have a form of second sight which over the story seems to be linked with some form of tachyon particles travelling back in time to which they are genetically disposed to be sensitive. The family are pursued by police and nearly escape into a strange parallel (or more likely future) world her husband saw as a boy - he decides not to flee to it (not least as Hope can't see it) but does thrown an illegal gun he has there - possession of this has he and Hope arrested and interrogated on terrorism charges, only to be released when his father discovers the gun in his house, presumably having retrieved it from the other land. In many ways a very interesting story - with an interesting take on a logical extension of a combination of Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness policies and a convincing geo-political future. It also conveys very well what happens when ordinary people get caught up in anti-terrorist actions and the police state. The second sight story line becomes increasingly dominant and largely ruins the story and there are some crucial illogicalities (why was his father not monitored when he retrieved the gun and most crucially why in the future world is reproduction not asexual or at least artificially engendered)."}, {"userName": "Mouldy Squid", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3914854-mouldy-squid", "userReview": "This is a strange moment for me. I want to assign a high rating for this book, I want to love it and I want to tell everyone to rush out and buy a copy. But I can't do any of those things and this leaves me feeling conflicted and confused. I love Ken MacLeod books, and I do not love this one. This leads to a cognitive dissonance I seldom experience.There is nothing egregiously wrong with Intrusion, but there is nothing wonderfully great about it either. The characters are well rounded, the plot is twisty and turny, the social and political questions raised are timely and important, the prose is up to Mr. MacLeod's usually standards. This should be an interesting book, an important book. But, instead, it is unrelentingly average. The wonder one feels when reading The Stone Canal or the breathless excitement of Newton's Wake or the philosophical enlightenment of Learning the World are completely missing. There are no mind-bending gulfs, no shocking surprises, no society changing dilemmas. It's bland.This should not be. The plot is deep, the questions it poses are profound, the twist is unforeseen. And yet, somehow, the whole novel is nothing much more than a tepid warning of state intrusion into personal privacy and self-determination. MacLeod is a better writer than this.I want to love this book, I really do. It explores themes I am interested in, raises questions I think society needs to examine, I like the characters. I just can't love it and I don't really know why. At least he doesn't give away the big mystery in the prologue like he did with The Restoration Game.Is it worth reading even if you aren't a Ken MacLeod fan? Sure. It's well written and others might find it more engaging than I have. It does present important themes that should be thought about and discussed. The premise is actually very interesting. Is it MacLeod's best novel, or even one of his better ones? No. If you are looking for a The Night Sessions or a Cassini Division you will be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Alice", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1529137-alice", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this British dystopia of the liberal nanny state. It's so refreshing to read a thoughtful, creative dystopia that does what good SF does best: extrapolates current social trends to their extreme. In future Britain, women's bodies are tightly regulated so as to prevent any harm to future children, but in a way that seems perfectly normal, rational, and egalitarian (Handmaid's Tale this is not). When one average woman decides that, for no apparent reason, she doesn't want to take the \"fix\" -- a pill that cures all genetic imperfections in utero-- she runs afoul of the welfare state, local politics, and many of her peers. Domestic drones and surveillance run large, but somehow the world doesn't feel spooky or terrifying.. more like humdrum. Which is even more frightening. I haven't been able to stop thinking about this book since reading it two weeks ago, which is the mark of a great dystopic novel.

The near-future setting was excellently drawn and extremely thought-provoking. On the one hand, I found the casual loss of civil liberties and oppressive state protectiveness towards women and children convincing. On the other hand, I had the horrible feeling that this was the best case scenario; it felt like a legacy of Blair and Brown, not of the Coalition's assault on the NHS. (Indeed the government in confirmed to be Labour-led.) Although 'Intrusion' reads like a dystopian narrative, it also evokes a stable UK with a social safety net and free healthcare. A worse scenario would retain the unrelenting government surveillance and perpetual war on terrorism, whilst public services are shredded by 'free' markets. Moreover, the world of 'Intrusion' has clearly got to grips with climate change, largely using GM organisms and carpeting the Sahara desert with solar panels. On these bases, it looks bad but a lot better than the future that the UK is actually heading for. So this novel made me confront my own ambivalence; is the total sacrifice of civil liberties inevitable in order to address climate change? Have we left it so late to reduce emissions that the only remotely effective policies would have to be enforced by an oppressive state? Moreover, would you prefer to have your privacy invaded and liberty curtailed on the basis of state welfarism or market forces? And that old favourite: to what extent does material comfort compensate for loss of privacy and freedom? To what extent do we even notice the loss of something as ill-defined as freedom? The 21st century UK of CCTV and PRISM et al has shambled carelessly into a 1984-style surveillance society, but is it worth worrying about? The wonderful thing about 'Intrusion' is that it has no easy answers whatsoever. At various points, characters discuss their angles on civil liberty, based on theory (nice name-checking of Foucault, for example) and experience (of police profiling especially), but never come to firm conclusions. This of course rings much truer than such discussions leading to absolute agreement on a clear answer - who has ever had that experience? I also found the feeling of individual helplessness in the face of monolithic institutions and their procedures viscerally convincing. 'Intrusion' reminded me the extent to which technology exacerbates this helplessness. A government algorithm finds some pattern in your movements and net use, automatically tagging you as suspect. How does one argue with that? Is it better or worse than human civil servants arbitrarily suspecting groups of people, for their behaviour or some other characteristic, such as ethnicity? Naturally, algorithms are ultimately written and controlled by humans, so have no inherent independence, let alone objectivity. Perhaps, though, they foster the development of that dangerous mindset of deferring individual judgement, \"I was just doing my job\", which has led to so many atrocities in the past.Wow, I'm three paragraphs in without making any reference to what 'Intrusion' is actually about. Briefly, a family in near future London are expecting a second child. The mother, named Hope, doesn't wish to take 'the fix', a GM medicine that corrects various potential genetic defects in a foetus. She cannot articulate why she refuses this even to herself, incurring a mixture of suspicion, anger, and bafflement. The small act, of refusing to take a pill that isn't even technically compulsory, triggers a fascinating escalation of events. Whilst I was very invested in the fate of Hope and her family, the wider implications and bigger questions raised by the story made it exceptional. For instance, issues around the future of feminism, the intersection of women's rights and children's rights, and bodily autonomy. There are many other issues I could mention (the role of science in politics! the nature of criticism!). Rather than rambling further, though, I'll conclude by noting that it is a timely, subtle, well-written, and intelligent novel. I highly recommend it, especially if you feel stifled by the slew of ephemeral news headlines and want to contemplate the implications of trends in 21st century society in more depth.(Unrelated footnote: I would have lost this entire review by inadvertent clicking, were it not for the Lazarus extension for chrome.

The world the characters live in (a near future Britain) is superficially pleasant and at the start of the novel they\u2019d probably say they were genuinely content with their life, but despite that this is clearly a dystopian novel. One of the effective parts of the book is how Hope Morrison\u2019s life gradually falls apart and her discontent grows with the world she lives in, all beginning with a single small act of rebellion where she refuses to take a pill while pregnant that would cause her child to grow up genetically immune to most diseases. Many of the other characters in the book are frustrated with her inability to explain why she\u2019s refusing to take the pill, and even in her internal narrative she doesn\u2019t seem to be doing it out of any deeply held conviction. I\u2019ve read some of the other reviews of the book and many readers seem equally frustrated by her actions but I think they do make sense, it is perhaps irrational but I think her refusal is clearly an expression of her frustration about not being given any choice in how to live her life. I think in most ways the portrayal of the dystopia is effective, in terms of showing how oppressive even a generally benevolent society can be against those who transgress against its norms. One thing that works well is that it doesn\u2019t take the easy option of having some sinister conspiracy to be uncovered, it\u2019s a portrayal of a society that does things varying from frustrating to horrific while all the team believing it is acting in the best interests of its people. The society does to be an intentional exaggeration of modern society, some elements can feel a bit caricatured but it works well enough as satire even if it sometimes struggles to be plausible enough to be taken entirely seriously. Perhaps the oddest feature of the novel is the mix between the fairly mundane near-future setting and one of the major plotlines in which Hope\u2019s husband is revealed to have vivid visions of an alternate or future society, the two plotlines coming together when he takes his family back to his childhood home on the Isle of Lewis (it wouldn\u2019t be a Ken MacLeod book without at least one visit to Scotland). It\u2019s a reasonably interesting plotline but it feels a bit fantastical and out of step with the rest of the novel. It does all end up with a fairly satisfying ending, although there are probably a few subplots along the way which maybe didn\u2019t add much to the novel.MacLeod\u2019s writing has always been easy to read and this is no exception (aside from the occasional lecture on political philosophy). Hope and her husband are both interesting and complex characters, and I think the fact they would sometimes struggle to explain why they\u2019re doing what they are doing is actually fairly realistic. Some of the supporting characters feel a bit simplistic and only there to deliver a particular viewpoint, but I think the lead characters have enough depth to make up for that. Intrusion is a slightly difficult book to rate because it has plenty of interesting ideas, does some things well, but ultimately seems to fall short of being as good as it could have been \u2013 something it has in common with MacLeod\u2019s previous few books. I wouldn\u2019t say it is entirely a success but I think there\u2019s enough done well for it to be worth reading."}, {"userName": "Gem", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4758153-gem", "userReview": "I actually got my biro pen and started editing this book at one point, it was that awful.

This one starts out with a really intriguing social-sf question - should a woman have to take a simple pill, with no side effects, to make sure her unborn child is healthy - and degenerates into (totally unrelated to the question) silly science subplots, ideological wankery and lame thriller-lite evil-government shenanigans. That said, I still think it's a step up from his recent books - the characterization is better, the pace is spot on and and it doesn't completely dissolve in terms of plot and theme. Unfortunately, theres just too many...potshots. The \"opposition\" are ridiculous caricatures and the whole thing appears to be based on a slippery slope argument, (laws against smoking in pubs>get hauled in by the police for going into a building someone smoked in once while pregnant.) The ideological questions get explained instead of actually being expressed in the book (characters sit around telling each other about Foucalt,) and everything has to be an extension of a current political process in a neat way \"...her mother's generation, in a moment of frivolity, had surrendered feminism...\" THIS IS YOU, LADY, YOU FOLLOW?!) And theres that now frankly disturbing fetish for the Labour Party again, (you should get that looked at, Mr. MacLeod), though at least they're evil in this one. It's a shame, as theres a really, really interesting book buried somewhere in here, about the tug between individual freedom and social contract, about women and women's bodies, about the construction of religion and ideology and the way individuals function and make decisions in that...it just got lost somewhere, to wander amongst the tachyons, time travelers and torturers of the Outer Hebrides instead.

Besides the central premise, there are many other extrapolations arising from society as we know it to construct something that, taken as a whole, paints quite a worrying picture of our future. There are several parallels with George Orwell's \"1984\" although this story presents a far more subtler mechanism of control, and one no doubt more relevant to today's readers. What we have here is a \"nanny state\" tyranny, one that is attempting to preserve the illusion of freedom whilst being completely intolerant of dissent.While I found all this fascinating, the side of the story that looked at Hugh's visions of the past/future somewhat of an unwanted distraction from the main premise.

What stands out is the writers imagination in this very good speculative fiction.The story imagines a society in which pregnant women are encouraged to take a tablet ' the fix' , this eradicates genetic disorders in the foetus. The moral issue places the family of the book and Hope Morrison the pregnant woman in the centre of a battle against the state and the forces of individual freedom and science try to help her.What is so good about this writing is that the issues that the writer draws out are so possible. This is not the world of the far right or extreme religion of A handmaids tale (a wonderful example of speculative fiction),it is a government that sees science as helping society yet the individual who wants the right to choose is in conflict with an apparently libertarian regime which uses the police to suppress that freedom. The book also touches on second sight, is this visions of the past, the future or hallucinations, this gift becomes part of the plot and is believable.

It shows a spoon holding a rather \u201cnormal\u201d looking somewhat inoffensive tablet. Upon reading the book you find out the tablet is called \u201cThe Fix\u201d in simple, basic terms it is a tablet all pregnant women are encouraged and somewhat expected to take. The Fix claims to literally fix any genetic defects whilst the baby is in the womb. The title on the cover is in an attention grabbing red and its name of Intrusion totally fits the book when you read it. The authors name is in the same font but black which fits in with what I see as a clinical feel about the cover.There is also a quote from Iain M Bank, \u201cA twistedly clever, frighteningly plausible dystopian glimpse\u201d I totally agree with Iain M Banks description of the book, but I don\u2019t like the quote being on the front cover! The cover would remain so much more clinical and striking without that quote! The quote should in my opinion be on the back cover of the book, with the quote by Cory Doctrow and the Guardian. It is one of my pet hates, quotes marring the beauty of a front cover, a by-line yes, a quote from another Author or reader no!So now onto the book, as Iain M Bank says, the book has a twisted quality to it. I think it very representative of the increasingly present \u201cbig brother\u201d society we are living in. This book and what happens in it re so realistically told that it isn\u2019t a large leap to think it could really happen in the not too distant future. I mean who knows what types of medication the scientists are developing.The book tell the story of Hugh Morrison and his pregnant wife Hope. Hope doesn\u2019t want to take \u201cThe Fix\u201d for no other reason really other than she just doesn\u2019t want to, she doesn\u2019t feel the need, her first son Nick who is fit and healthy was not subjected to The Fix in her womb so why should this pregnancy and baby be any different. Also I think like most women hope doesn\u2019t like to feel she is being told what she must do. So when the health visitor brings up her reluctance to take \u201cThe Fix\u201d Hope explains her feelings. Bad, bad, move because now she is flagged up in the \u201csystem\u201d as an \u201cobjector\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker\u201d. There are legitimate ways to \u201cget out\u201d of taking \u201cThe Fix\u201d you can object on religious grounds, some people do this even though they aren\u2019t really religious but Hope is principled and really doesn\u2019t see that as an option.The society in this book is quite different too, it\u2019s sort of set in the future somewhat, its all very \u201cbig brother\u201d is watching you, with cameras in your home watching you as well as in the workplace and on the streets. If you mix with people considered by the police/government to be unsavoury, or take off your monitor ring (if you are a woman & pregnant) that lets the health service know you have \u201cbeen exposed\u201d to smoking or alcohol etc.For those few who dare to be different and perhaps even rebel a little they can be picked up and harassed. There\u2019s an incident in the book when a young professional woman is picked up by the police and interrogated because she has looked at a wall and seen the same piece of graffiti twice and not reported it! The poor woman is traumatised but too discouraged by the way the system works to even complain.There\u2019s lots of new gadgets and ways of society in this book, but the weirs/strange thing is that I could really believe some of it actually happening.The other aspect of the book is Hugh\u2019s family coming from a small Island surrounded by mystery, and suspicion and strange tales. Hugh\u2019s family are somewhat \u201cdifferent\u201d as they have gene that allows \u201csecond sight\u201d could this be a valid reason not to take \u201cThe Fix\u201dThe book also deals with other people\u2019s reactions to Hope and her impending decision.So what did I think to the book? Well it was rather wordy! (bit like my review)political and I suppose you could say controversial, at times some of the political stuff seemed to drag a little. Having said that I did really enjoy the book. The whole \u201csecond sight\u201d issue part of the book was at times confusing, and not really explored as much as I would have liked. I was also a little disappointed in the ending, all that Hope had gone through . . . . and then for things to end as they did.So did I enjoy the book? Yes! On the whole I did. Would I recommend the book? To a patient reader who loves debate and dystopian too, yes. Would I read more by Ken Macleod? Maybe."}, {"userName": "Simon Mcleish", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish", "userReview": "This review first appeared on my blog here.Ken MacLeod is an author whose work I sometimes really like (the Star Faction books) but who at other times doesn't really connect with me (the Engines of Light trilogy). Intrusion falls into the second category.It is one of several recent novels by MacLeod which are stand-alone near future dystopias, rather like the series of similar works produced by John Brunner in the 1970s. There are two main elements to Intrusion: an encroaching \"nanny state\", particularly concerned to make people live more and more healthy lifestyles; and the moral and social consequences of advances in genetic engineering.These are given a human aspect through the central character, a pregnant woman who refuses to take \"the fix\", a pill which sorts out an embryo's genetic abnormalities. Although this refusal is not a crime, Hope is unwilling even to discuss the reasons behind her decision, and this makes her a person of interest to the police - rather in the way that attending a mosque seems to do in the West today. The issues soon become muddled, as the plot development is based on the possibility that Hope's husband might have the second sight, and this begins to take prominence over the elements which were important at the beginning.My problem with this is that the second sight, by its nature more fantastical than the otherwise realistic seeming near future setting of the novel, just doesn't fit in to Intrusion. It feels like a device used to push the plot forward, without being integrated into the action in a meaningful way. It is given a pseudo-scientific explanation, but one with some pretty obvious holes in it to my mind.In other areas, too, it feels that there is a certain laziness to the construction of Intrusion, as evidenced by the name of the protagonist. This may be intended to be an ironic gesture, but is neither so outrageously obvious to be fun (as Hiro Protagonist is in Snow Crash), nor sufficiently understated to be interesting.The subject touches on issues at the very basis of how humans live in social groups. To do so necessitates giving up some individual freedom for the good of the group; the question is, where does the line between individual and state lie? Since the answer to this question differs radically from person to person, culture to culture, and subject to subject, it is not one which can be discussed in depth in a single book - indeed, I think it could be argued that the whole of political theory, and much of sociology and anthropology, deals with ways in which this question can be answered. So it is not surprising that even the relatively limited scope of the discussion in Intrusion merely scratches the surface of what might be said about health care and the government, but I did feel that more could be said - Intrusion seems to be more a statement of a fixed position (essentially, that Hope should have the right to refuse if she so wishes), than an analysis or a treatment in which the plot involves a developing portrayal of the issues. Brunner's dystopias were mainly about attempts to change society (or, more specifically, attempts to reform society to ameliorate problems caused by undirected sociological development), and this makes them much more satisfying if more depressing than this novel.All in all, an unsatisfying novel which never really gripped my attention."}, {"userName": "Dark Matter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6884699-dark-matter", "userReview": "This and more reviews, interviews etc on Dark Matter Zine, an online magazine. http://www.darkmatterzine.com. This review was written by Nalini Haynes for Dark Matter Zine.Hope and Hugh Morrison are expecting their second child. This is the second time Hope has refused \u2018the fix\u2019, a magic bullet that cures all genetic abnormalities while immunising the foetus against many childhood illnesses.In this Brave New World overtly referencing 1984, a father sued his wife forcing her to take the fix because his wife had no acceptable justification for a conscientious objection. This precedent allows social services to pressure women \u2013possibly force women \u2013 to take the fix unless they have a religious justification for refusal.Hope posts her concerns to a parenting forum. The next day when Hope arrives at nursery school to drop her son Nick off, Hope is blocked by angry parents. These are parents of \u2018faith kids\u2019, other children whose mothers have not taken the fix, but they are angry that Hope would put their children at risk of infection.The hypocrisy would be unbelievable if I hadn\u2019t seen this kind of outrageous judgementalism in real life:\u2018You\u2019re not really disabled because you can pass for normal\u2019\u2018You\u2019re not really bisexual because you have a partner of the opposite gender\u2019\u2018You\u2019re not really a lesbian because you\u2019re a transsexual (formerly a man)\u2019 And so on. My studies have been enlightening [ironic tone].Intrusion explores potential development of current social dynamics. Everything from the pointlessness of some academic research to racial profiling; from police state victimisation to wilful ignorance or collusion leading to impending disaster.My only criticism of Intrusion is MacLeod\u2019s attempt to justify second sight \u2013 usually a feature of fantasy \u2013 by introducing tachyons. Human perception of tachyons, particles that are supposed to travel backwards in time, do not account for sound and smell crossing the time barrier. Nor would tachyons account for a future human seeing into his distant past and talking to someone in that past.Reference to Tir Na Og, a Gaelic land of the fae, also pushes what could otherwise be a strong science fiction novel into the realm of fantasy. If Intrusion had been written by a woman it would have been classified as fantasy; because Intrusion was written by a man, he gets away with fantasy elements.Rant aside, Intrusion is an interesting story with chilling observations about human nature and where UK (and Australian) societies could be headed as citizens cede individual autonomy to government control. I\u2019d prefer the science to be tighter but the characters\u2019 engagement with issues confronting them are well worth the read.Intrusion is an interesting novel to engage a book discussion group.I need to add: \u2018YAY for a dystopian novel that isn\u2019t aimed at the YA market!\u2019 Intrusion has adults dealing with adult issues, a refreshing change."}, {"userName": "Anne Charnock", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6015278-anne-charnock", "userReview": "Ken MacLeod presents a vision of a near-future world in which many of our freedoms are rolled back in the cause of child protection, specifically the protection of the unborn foetus.

Her husband Hugh, brought up on Scotland\u2019s Isle of Lewis, is willing to go along with her wishes. However, the health service is becoming more dogmatic. Doctors and health visitors are willing to compile surveillance evidence from other sources to threaten Hope. Her occasional contacts with supposed troublemakers are nudging Hope\u2019s data profile towards a tipping point \u2013 one that would label her as unsuitable for parenting.The authorities are also using the threat of terrorism as the validation for widespread surveillance. It all adds up to a situation where a citizen\u2019s every move, every contact, every minor infringement is known to the police. Police stop-and-search is extended to stop-and-torture, followed by free trauma counselling. Hmm\u2026Events spiral out of control and the Morrison family retreats to the Isle of Lewis. Early in the novel, we learn that Hugh \u2013 along with other people on the isle \u2013 experiences second-sight. And this adds a second thread to MacLeod\u2019s tale.MacLeod doesn\u2019t talk down to his readers; he expects them to keep up with his excursions into genetics, and the specific research interests of Geena, a post-doc student operating within SynBioTech.It\u2019s a chilling and cautionary dystopian tale that deals primarily with the topical issue of surveillance. And it will appeal to anyone who fights against the health and safety culture.I have some issues with the novel. I am uncomfortable with the mix of straightforward dystopian fiction with fantasy. Hugh\u2019s second-sight takes the reader into the realm of fantasy and it sits awkwardly within the novel.Some of the writing is decidedly lumpy. I had to re-read many sentences before I could grasp their sense.And at the start of Intrusion I feel Ken MacLeod throws too much back-story at the reader. Not subtle."}, {"userName": "Jani", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5905934-jani", "userReview": "Intrusion is a fine example of how fiction can bring philosophical debates closer to home. It takes the ethical debates about the possibilities of biotechnology choosing their most affecting parts (what about the children?!?) and crafts them into a dystopian vision.In the world where Hope and Hugh live genetic engineering has found way to remove almost all of the childhood ailments in a simple gene-altering pill form. Hope is tempted by its possibilities but would choose not to take it nevertheless. However, in the nurturing society she lives in taking such risks with the offspring are barely tolerated and she finds herself under pressure to change the genetic makeup of her future child. Will she keep her head or will her hand be forced either to taking the pill or to another just as drastic action.MacLeod's novel's main struggle is between the individual choice and the role of the society. Most of the time, the novel suggested reading sides with the individual; the society is portrayed as well-meaning yet oppressive in its insistence to come between individual and his/her choice. As MacLeod does not bring the big corporations, another usual oppressive force using technology wrong (and usually more nefariously) into the story, the society is painted quite black even if many of its actors are not evil as such. Then again none of the characters or actors are represented by pure white tones; while the novel emphasizes certain aspects, it leaves enough shades to get the reader thinking from different angles. While these layers are few compared to the whole ethical debate around biotechnology, they flesh out some of the questions raised in an accessible form, although, in a form that should not be swallowed without chewing."}, {"userName": "Gerhard", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard", "userReview": "Ken MacLeod may have moved away from the SF novels of his earlier career to (more lucrative?) mainstream techno thrillers, but his interest in politics and sociology remains as urgent as ever. This makes Intrusion a superb example of extrapolative SF, a sort of 1984 for the modern world.Except in this extrapolation of 1984, everyone is fed, schooled, employed and safe; all the infrastructure necessary for civilisation is in place. And what culminated in the institutionalisation of the ultimate police state? Why, that old bugbear, political correctness, of course.There is a lot of angry humour in this novel, which is typical of MacLeod. A problem with this sort of polemical novel is that the characters can simply become different viewpoints, but Macleod is careful enough to make Hugh and Hope a viable enough family that their plight is genuinely moving.Intriguingly, the description of the Scottish countryside reveals another facet to MacLeod, as a nature writer. A lot of reviews have complained about these sections; I thought them a welcome addition to the fascinating descriptions of the future London urbanscape.MacLeod is at pains to make his near-future scenario feel as lived-in as possible, which means that Intrusion is crammed with projections, scenarios and really cool technology and ideas. A fantastic novel from one of the genre\u2019s most committed political theorists."}, {"userName": "Liam Proven", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6730645-liam-proven", "userReview": "Ken Macleod has been moving his SF from far future tales spanning distant star systems to colder, more rationally-extrapolated near-future visions of distinctly worryingly plausible futures. Intrusion features perhaps his most minimally-different future yet: a Britain of ubiquitous surveillance, extreme policing and enforced conformity done with the best possible taste. No Orwellian dystopias here: Macleod is almost infinitely cleverer and more believable, not to mention being far better SF.Intrusion hearkens to a classic SF short, where aliens offer a true miracle drug: a small, painless skin patch that cures all disease. But what is a disease? For the aliens, this includes intelligence. Macleod doesn't spell out exactly what his cure might fix \u2013 it could be as little as slightly superior sight. But as is often the way with Ken, what he merely hints at is far, far bigger.Instrusion gave me both the willies as well as making me want to visit the Scottish isles (as I write from Sodor and Mann). To both beguile and terrify far more than any monster or disease in a single, by modern standards slim tome is quite a trick. It's excellent. I do miss the space-squid, though."}, {"userName": "Kristi Sawyer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38501496-kristi-sawyer", "userReview": "This book is seriously addictive! A future world where pregnant women must take a \"fix\" to protect their children from genetic diseases, and you are always being watched. Hugh and Hope have made the decision to not take \"the fix\", but this isn't easy when you don't have a religion to hide behind as an excuse. On the run from the authorities, and trying to cover the tracks of their digital footprint, this makes for a thrilling read. This book particularly appealed to me because it has a lot of very accurate, intriguing science references, which I really enjoyed the chance to geek-out to! I couldn't put this book down, and when I really had to, was itching to pick it back up again! This has been my first taste of SciFi for a while, and it was a great entrance back in, because I am going to be looking out for many more in the near future.

A deep insight into the relationship between government and the public, and KM makes you experience the issues, and feel them.Truly brilliant ending which puts a new focus on all the preceding events in the novel. I also like how seemingly disparate characters and events are all part of the same trap \u2014 and how the characters appear to react differently, but actually have the same response. (It\u2019s a bit like Catch 22, only the trap isn\u2019t Catch 22.)

The concept is based on one which a dreadfully Orwellian MP outlines to the central character; people should be allowed to make their own choices based on the best possible information, as people cannot be expected or trusted with this information the state should impose the choice that they could be expected to have made if this information was available. Therefore freewill in matters of health and other areas should be curtailed by the state. Much of this novel rings dreadfully true, with women being encouraged to wear monitor rings to ensure they don't consume 'harmful' substances if there is any risk of their being pregnant, with home security systems being installed to record any possible domestic abuse, and with fears surrounding extreme health and safety forcing women especially to work from home. Society is shown as being almost totally reliant on information devices not only mobile phones but also computing devices which are essentially the same as the Google glasses recently unveiled. These devices coupled with the monitor rings, are able to track and inform the sate of every move and every transgression made by individuals, all of which are recorded and can be used in criminal and family actions. Social services are active in all walks of life, and along with police 'questioning' methods are used to ensure that people all stay in line. The whole concept feels frighteningly possible, and while avoiding most of the shock tactics used by other dystopian style visions of the future, manages to build to an even more terrifying whole. Much of the technology mentioned appears to be essentially new generation versions of current items, glasses which connect to the internet, apps which reveal details of surroundings and other people, and even bracelets to monitor alcohol intake are all in existence now, and this novel merely takes their application to a new, yet understandable level. With the news being increasingly full of stories about the need to ensure people only make 'good' choices in terms of diet, exercise and welfare in general; presumably as a cover to mask other more important issues about the political society in which we live, this version of the future seems highly plausible. The side story which touches upon the hidden possibilities of mutations to the human genome, was interesting, as was the argument that in striving to 'cure' diseases and genetic 'errors' we risk losing evolutionary possibilities. Overall this was an extremely well written work, which I do not hesitate to recommend to anyone who has enjoyed novels such as When She Woke, 1984 or The Handmaid's Tale."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33242325-jonathan", "userReview": "This is the story of a time in the future when medical science has advanced to the point of allowing a pregnant woman the opportunity to take a pill (called a \u201cFix\u201d in the book) that will prevent most childhood diseases and genetic defects. This certainly seems like a no-brainer \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t want their child to be free of these possible maladies? But Hope chooses not to. This is where I started having problems with this book. First, I totally respect someone\u2019s right to choose. Hope is not obligated to take the pill and no one is forcing her to take it. It\u2019s totally up to her. Second, whatever choice you make, have a good reason for doing it. To me Hope comes across as not wanting to take it because she simply doesn\u2019t want to. Her first child, who she didn\u2019t take the pill for, is fine and healthy after all. I can understand if there are concerns about the safety and long-term implications of taking it and/or for religious reasons. Those are valid reasons to me. But Hope isn\u2019t coming from either of those places. This stumped me. It seems incredibly selfish. What\u2019s it going to take \u2013 having a child and then discovering there are medical issues? It\u2019s the child who suffers from your decision! You may suffer mentally and emotionally while they suffer mentally, emotionally and physically.The setting for the book reminded me of the movie \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d in that it was set in Britain in the not-so-far-away future and the government was spying on everyone and everything they do. There are political aspects the author presents that I did enjoy reading and pondering. And I did understand why they would \u2018flag\u2019 Hope when she was questioned about her decision. If she said it was for religious reasons or concerns about its safety, they probably would have left her alone. But again, she just doesn\u2019t want to and this puts her on their list. Again, a selfish act because now she has put herself in harm\u2019s way as well as her husband and young son. The story about her husband\u2019s gift of \u2018second sight\u2019 or \u2018vision\u2019 was a great addition and added an element of intrigue to the story I found enjoyable.I also found it hard to really like the characters. I kept waiting for something to come along that would cause me to latch onto them \u2013 someone \u2013 and that never came for me. There was a certain depth to their character missing. This is an interesting read and while I wish I could have rated it higher as it did have a good storyline, the lack of character personality and likability holds me back."}], "description": "Imagine a near-future city, say London, where medical science has advanced beyond our own and a single-dose pill has been developed that, taken when pregnant, eradicates many common genetic defects from an unborn child.
