Buy me some peanuts and cracker jack. I don\u2019t care if I never get back. That sentiment was put to the test on April 18, 1981, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, when the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings played the longest game in professional baseball history. Given that the song is generally sung in the middle of the 7th inning, or after six and a half innings of play, the fans, had they been of a mind, could have sung the tune four more times before the game was finally concluded.Dan Barry, a sports columnist for the New York Times, a guy who had lived in Pawtucket for four years, uses this singular game as a structure around which to build his depiction of minor league baseball, more particularly Triple-A level baseball, using the example here to stand in for the whole.His approach is one that would give anyone with a generous dose of OCD a thrill. I did not keep track of the number of individuals who are mentioned and for whom Barry offers at least a little biographical info, but I expect it easily squirts past the defenders into triple digit territory. There is no index available for cheating and coming up with a credible number. Leave it that if a cat had wandered into the field during that game, Barry probably interviewed it, and I expect had he been able to identify the gulls that were in attendance, they would undoubtedly be pretty sick of him asking them about the game, and checking their eggs to find out if the unborn heard anything their feathered parental units might have mentioned about it. I do not mean this as a knock, but merely to offer a sense of Barry\u2019s overall approach. It is reminiscent of an actual baseball field, a wide swath, covered in grass, only inches deep, but with particular parts that emerge, and form the more significant elements of his story, the mound, the bases. One or two deserve mention.In one of the true rarities in baseball, the owner of the Pawtucket Red Sox sounds like he was a pretty decent guy. We learn about him lending a helping hand when the help really was for someone else and not just a roundabout way of helping himself. The best element was Barry\u2019s look at Dave Koza, a career minor-leaguer who was known for his home runs, but whose major league career only had warning track power, a Crash Davis sort. Barry looks at Koza (really, someone must have nicknamed him \u201cLost\u201d, but we never come across that here.) His story carries all the hope-and-dream elements that drive so many of these young men. Dave was the fellow who would get the game-winning hit in the bottom of the 33rd. Barry gives us an illuminating look at the history of the stadium in which the game was played, tells us about the umpires, the ball boy, the intern, the security guard, the where-are-they-nows, the whole nine yards innings, or in this case thirty three. In a way it struck me as having something in common with rain delays, when hapless broadcasters (yes, he looks at those guys too) have to work extra hard to come up with material to cover the dead air between pitches. Barry certainly does work hard, and manages not only to fill in the blanks, I think he may have actually created some to give himself more time to fill. If you are a baseball fan, this is a fun book. It is nice to know that Rich Gedman, Wade Boggs, Bruce Hurst, Cal Ripkin Jr,. Bobby Ojeda, and a few other eventual pros took part in the game, and that a game of such duration was ultimately made possible by a cut-and-paste failure in the updating of the league rule book. It is nice to learn of Bobby O\u2019s role in sparking behavior that had once gotten a batboy ejected from a game. It is fun to hear that Mike Hargrove\u2019s extended at-bat preparations earned him the moniker \u201cThe Human Rain Delay.\u201d If you are not a baseball fan, Bottom of the 33rd offers a look at a piece of American culture that is as true today as it was over thirty years ago. I can tell you from painful personal experience here in New York City that it is generally a bad idea to go to a ballgame in April. Hell, May and maybe even June, can feel like a wind-blown tundra in our stadiums. And farther north and east it must be even worse. It is no shock that only nineteen spectators made it through the entirety of the game. The book will take a lot less time to read than the game took to be played, and you will not be in danger of having bodily parts crystallize and drop off while you are completing it. Bottom of the 33rd may not be a grand slam, but it is at least a hustle-triple. And it is definitely a good idea to Root, root, root for the home team. =============================EXTRA STUFF2/24/15 - Barry wrote a heart-wrenching piece about the decision to move the Pawtucket team to Providence.

I have been putting off writing this review as I have been finding it difficult to express my feelings on the subject. For me, the game of baseball holds a special place in my heart. Whenever I have a chance to sit down and watch a game, it brings back feelings that I have had since childhood. Feelings of excitement, anticipation, potential and awe. My first heroes (that were not within my own family) were all out on the baseball diamond and graced the faces of my baseball card collection. Maybe Kelly Gruber is no one to you, but the former third baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays was my hero! For me, this story distills these feelings and infuses them into the real life people in this real life story.In short, the book tells the story of the longest baseball game played. It was a 33 inning affair that occurred between two minor league baseball teams. The game was filled with players who would go on to successful careers and players who would go on to non baseball related jobs. The author does a superb job of detailing the game itself while at the same time providing insight and back story into the players playing the game and various persons connected with the game and in the stands. If you thought that authors such as Patrick Rothfuss and Anthony Ryan were skilled at detailing the creation of myth over thousands of pages, than you will be amazed at the authors ability to create legend within a mere 257 pages. The book also serves a case study in myth making. He takes a game that is a footnote to history and an unimportant game in the career of future hall of famers, Cal Ripken Jr. and Wade Boggs but by adding the emotion of the game, the history of the players and a wide array of other stories, he has created something bigger than the sum of its parts.This is my best effort at reviewing what may be the best piece of non-fiction I have ever read. My reaction to the book was quite emotional. It may hold interest to a passive fan but it will be absorbed and understood by everyone who knows that baseball is more than just a game."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "In the cold night of a Rhode Island April, two minor league teams began a baseball game that would not be over for another 8 hours. Thus begins the journalistic novel by Dan Berry about the 1981 game between the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings both of the International League. Well researched and balanced, this entertaining account is more than just the story about the longest recorded game in baseball history, Berry has masterfully combined history, psychology and sociology to tell a modern day story of America itself. Tragic, comic, endearing, and all the while reported with a brutally honest theatrical irony, Berry has a gem of a baseball book and a good read in it\u2019s own right. I gave it 4 stars because it was so well written, if you\u2019re a baseball fan, consider that this should be a 5 star book, very good, I\u2019ll think about this book often."}, {"userName": "Lady\u2665Belleza\u2605\u2730", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7773122-lady-belleza", "userReview": "Baseball is my favorite sport, I am counting the days until it starts again. I\u2019m not kidding, I have a countdown clock on my phone and every morning I look at it and get all excited about how many days until pitchers and catchers report for spring training. It therefore should not be surprising that when I was at the library and walking past the non-fiction section my eyes were drawn to the baseball books.On September 22, 2012 the Yankees played the A\u2019s, that game lasted 14 innings, 5 hours and 43 minutes. The longest game for the Yankees since 2006. I was there for that game. I stayed for every inning, watched every pitch, every hit. The longest major league baseball game was 25 innings, but that isn\u2019t the longest professional ball game every played, that honor goes to a minor league game between the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings. This record still stands: 33 innings, 8 hours 25 minutes.There is a rule that a new inning cannot start after midnight, however the rule book the home plate umpire had did not have that paragraph in it so play continued until 4 in the morning, when the president of the league finally returned a phone call to the ball park. Play was halted at the 32nd inning. The next time the Red Wings were in town the game resumed. It took 1 inning and 18 minutes to finish the game. Two names you might recognize in this book are Wade Boggs, Pawtucket Red Sox and Cal Ripken, Jr., Rochester Red Wings.This book is more than just an account of a baseball game, we learn about life in the minor leagues, what players and managers and reporters had to put up with. We learn some of the history of the players, how their lives progressed after, who went to the major leagues and so on.

If anything, the marathon contest, which featured future Hall of Famers Cal Ripken and Wade Boggs, has ascended to legendary status, staking its claim among the sport's classic duels. What began as a routine Saturday night affair April 18, 1981, spilled into Sunday before eventually wrapping up two months later as a 3-2 Paw Sox win.Pawtucket's McCoy Stadium was packed on June 23 for the game's almost anti-climactic conclusion, when the Red Sox needed only one inning to decide matters. The true witnesses to history, however, barely numbered in double digits. When the two weary clubs were mercifully shooed off the field at 4:09 Easter morning, just 19 fans remained in the grandstand.Dan Barry wasn't among them. In fact, he was nowhere near Pawtucket for either the anonymous start or the spectacle of a conclusion, which drew media from as far away as England and Japan for a feel-good story in the early days of a strike that would shut down Major League Baseball for nearly two months. Which makes his gripping and lyrical retelling, Bottom of the 33rd: Hope, Redemption, and Baseball's Longest Game, all the more amazing, as he seems to have been everywhere all at once for the entire length of the game.He's there in the visitor's bullpen, where Red Wings reliever Steve Luebber trades scuffed baseballs to youngsters in the early innings for wood to fuel the bonfire that warms a squadron of relievers. He's in the parking lot watching the stepson of the scoreboard operator drain the battery of a Ford Pinto as he falls blissfully asleep in the back seat long before the game is half over. He's under the stands, peering through a hole with Red Sox manager Joe Morgan for the last 10 innings after having been ejected for arguing a call in the top of the 22nd. And, of course, he's on the field, where he accounts for every plate appearance in the bedeviling affair.The balls and strikes, base hits and fly balls are not what this story's about, however. Barry has gone both deeper and broader, rescuing the game's participants from a novelty of a box score, in which 219 at-bats were recorded. There's more to Rochester center fielder Dallas Williams than the 0-for-13 that followed him for the rest of his career. And as much as Jim Umbarger's 10 shutout innings of relief leap off the stat page, they reveal little about the man himself. Barry dug into every participant-on the field, in the front office, up in the press box, and down in the stands-to cull the true meaning of the sport.He captures the spirit of minor league baseball in the days before the corporate ownership groups dotted the landscape with miniature versions of big league cathedrals. These were shoestring operations, run largely by fresh-faced kids just out of school. Or younger. The clubhouses in Pawtucket were managed by a pack of neighborhood youths, who pushed the team's uniforms to a coin-operated Laundromat each morning in stolen shopping carts in the late 1970s, before new owner Ben Mondor took over and installed on-premises washers and dryers.While times have changed and minor league franchises are no longer run by the Little Rascals, today's generation of players can certainly relate to the mental grind their predecessors endured. Today's Triple-A rosters are populated with men just like Leubber, who in 1981 was fighting to return to the majors where he came within an out of a no-hitter for the Twins in 1976, and Dave Koza, the slugging first baseman who spent so long in Pawtucket he made it his long-time home after his career ended without a big league callup. For every Ripken there are a hundred more whose career will more closely resemble Bobby Bonner's brief big league stay.Barry caught up with everyone he could find, crafting their recollections of that fateful night into a romance illustrating the game's often heart-breaking allure. It's not an entirely original concept. Within the past couple years alone works like Perfect, Lew Paper's retelling of Don Larson's World Series masterpiece, and Jim Kaplan's The Greatest Game Ever Pitched, about the legendary 16-inning Warren Spahn-Juan Marichal bout in 1963, have tried to apply a bigger-picture perspective to a single game. But where those books felt contrived at times, Bottom of the 33rd weaves the game seamlessly into the stories of the men who were there in 1981.This International League classic is unlikely to ever be duplicated. The perfect storm that spawned it required a printing mishap, leaving the league's 12:50 a.m. curfew off the books; a hard-nosed, literalist interpretation of the rulebook by the head umpire; a league president who was so frequently hounded by inane phone calls that he didn't answer Pawtucket general manager Mike Tamburro's desperate plea for an end to the insanity; and a confounding wind knocking down a certain home-run blast off the bat of Sox outfielder Sam Bowen, which would have ended the game in the bottom of the 26th.In today's world of cell phones and internet, even a rule book glitch wouldn't spin this far out of control. But a generation ago, it happened. Dan Barry has captured it-and so much more-in this essential book for minor league baseball lovers."}, {"userName": "Doreen Petersen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24442706-doreen-petersen", "userReview": "What a great read for those interested in baseball!!!

The Triple A League Pawtucket Red Sox hosted the Rochester Red Wings. The Sox had future superstar Wade Boggs on their team, the Red Wings had the incomparable Cal Ripken Jr. at third base.But Barry wisely does not put those superstars at the center of his story. What makes this narrative interesting are the not-so-famous people. The Pawtucket owner, Ben Mondor, a wealthy businessman who grew up poor in Pawtucket and made it big, took the team at its lowest point and restored it to its former glory.He prized loyalty above all, and when Budweiser refused to sell him beer because the former owners owed them money, he remembered that for a long time. Miller sold him beer, and even though Budweiser was the fan favorite, and Budweiser eventually begged him to buy their beer year after year, Mondor stuck with Miller because they were loyal to him.Mondor put together a small but hardworking front office team, and they turned the bankrupt team into a success by \"keeping prices low, making the stadium safe and family-friendly and emphasizing that the Pawtucket players on the field were the Boston Red Sox of tomorrow.\"One of the most unforgettable characters is pitcher Win Remmerswaal. He is from the Netherlands, and \"doesn't seem to accept basic social customs, such as adherence to the law or value of currency.\" His car license plate was a \"piece of cardboard with a few meaningless numbers scribbled on it.\" At the end of one road trip, it was discovered that he was missing. He showed up several days later, explaining that he had never seen the nation's capital, so when they had a layover in Washington, he took a few days to sightsee. He is hilarious!Triple A baseball is the last step before the major league team, so there is an interesting dynamic on those teams. There are the young players destined for future glory, like Boggs and Ripken. There are 'old guys'- the 25 and 26 year-olds- who have kicked around for awhile, and this is their last shot at making the big team. Some of them get called up to play in September on the parent club, only to be sent back to Triple A next spring to try again.The agony of working to see your dream come true, knowing that there is a short time limit on it, is palpable in this book. First baseman Dave Koza has dragged his wife Ann from Florida to Pawtucket to Wyoming every year in pursuit of his dream. Ann finds some kind of factory work wherever they land, and she goes to every game. She is one of the 19 people who watched all 32 innings of the game, lasting until 4am on Easter morning when it was finally called. They are the heart of this marvelous book, and the end to their story is so moving.The longest game, which is finally finished two months later in Pawtucket, is told in detail, alternating with the stories of the people who participated in it. I grew up in Auburn, NY, which has a Single A baseball team, and this book really resonated with me. I know my entire family will want to read it.Barry gives the reader a close-up look at our national pasttime, and what that means for the cities where it is played. He tells the stories of the participants with honesty, humor, and heart. If you liked the movie, Bull Durham, this book is for you. It is a must-read for every baseball fan."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve", "userReview": "In 1981, I was 16 and following the Columbus Clippers, then the Triple-A farm team for the New York Yankees. The Clippers were part of the International League, of which the Pawtucket Red Sox and Rochester Red Wings were part, as well. I saw all these teams play several times a year, and saw several of the players (and managers) make it to the big leagues. If I remember right, the Columbus Clippers even ended up taking the Governor's Cup that year.In the beginning of the 1981 season, though, the teams from Pawtucket and Rochester played a game that ended up going 33(!) innings. I remember reading about it in the Columbus Dispatch, and I'm not sure I could have sat through a game that lasted over eight hours...The book was interesting, and it about so much more than simply this game for the record books. Each player was highlighted in some form or fashion, complete with background stories of how and where they grew up, and their trip(s) up to the Boston Red Sox or the Baltimore Orioles, if they made it at all. The attention to detail was incredible, and the game seemed to take a back seat to the players, the managers, and all of the supporting staff themselves.I'm not a huge baseball fan by any means, and usually don't watch many games until the season starts wrapping up and gets close to the playoffs. I would, however, recommend this book about the longest baseball game ever played to anyone interested in the history of the sport, and especially to anyone that wants to know how to write about an historical event (it's all about the people!)."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1245181-tom", "userReview": "Ok, I admit that it's easy to romanticize baseball in the dead of winter,which is when I read this book. And it's more than touch ironic that I, who rarely watch games on tv now because they've become longer than most operas (and with less action, since the game is shriveling on endless strikeouts, walks and pitching changes), would find a book about the longest game in history so fascinating. But pass the Cracker Jacks, there it is. Barry is such a good writer that I couldn't wait to pick up this book every evening. Here's a stylish highlight: \u201cHow short, now, the longest game seems. How ephemeral. On a night and early morning set aside for prayer, reflection, and everlasting joy, a baseball game insisted on the suspension of ordinary time. It gathered together a few dozen hopefuls in a poorly lit coliseum and refused them release for more than eight hours, providing them little comfort from the harsh elements beyond the heat generated by the burning of wood. It forced those watching the game to contemplate cosmic issues that transcend the successive crises of balls and strikes. The interdependence we all share. The inadequacy of statistics to measure one\u2019s worth. The existence of God. The dominion of nature over humankind, reflected by the howl of the night\u2019s wind, whoooosh, rising to muffle the profane howl of the Rochester center fielder.\u201dNow granted, digesting that much lyricism for an entire book would be like eating too many hot dogs drowning in mustard. But still, that's as good as anything the two benighted Roger's -- Kahn and Angell -- ever penned about life on the diamond. And Barry is just as good a storyteller as R1 and R2, as well, which is the real reason to read this book, because the story is not just about the game but about a rusty, snow-belt town, Pawtucket (or Puhtucket to locals)in midst of decades-long slump with nothing much to get excited about except a minor league team. It's not just about impending MLB stars like future Hall of Famers Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken Jr., who played on opposing teams, but about anonymous career minor leaguers who never made it to the Show; it's about failure despite hard work and perseverance that borders on both the perverse and the admirable. But it's also about success defined in myriad ways, like the local teenage clubhouse attendants who get an education in business ingenuity and organizational skills that would trump anything a Harvard MBA could produce. Barry does a great job of weaving in running profiles of everyone associated with the game, near and far -- players, managers, owners, announcers, vendors, reporters, club-house jockeys, mothers, spouses, politicians, cops -- with a stirring and entertaining inning by inning account of the game that I never found dull or repetitive.I suppose the big question here is would non-fans enjoy this book? I think so. I am no longer a die-hard fan myself, though I still read the sports page every morning, and I've dropped plenty of other sports stories, fiction and non-fiction, because the writing was over-wrought or cliche-ridden. Barry does not suffer from either of those maladies. He conveys a sense of wonderment without lapsing into sentimentality. Though the game was exhausting for everyone involved, Barry's writing compels you to stick around until the end of this historic triple-header and a half."}, {"userName": "Matt Simmons", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5588334-matt-simmons", "userReview": "A very, very enjoyable book. The allegory is perhaps too thick--it's a book about redemption, and the game in question takes place from Holy Saturday to Easter Sunday and lasts 33 innings, 33 being the age of Christ--but it seems, in its own odd way, charming. The best sportswriting is always about being a bit too sentimental, a bit too melodramatic; it almost has to be. After all, what we're talking about is essentially a children's game, and we're using this game to illustrate and find out about things that are a part of greater experience of being a human being. This would suggest that it'd have to be a bit over-written. And it is. But, again, that's a part of the genre--and Barry wonderfully overwrites with the best of them.The thing I love most about Barry's approach to the book is how he treats the game itself: Barry doesn't spend time trying to explain exactly what happened. We often lose our place in the game--what inning are we in, exactly? And that's more than okay; in fact, it's very good. For Barry's approach is to use this game as a canvas on which he can paint the lives of human beings, the life of a city, the life of a ballpark itself. At times, the book almost feels like a poor man's The Naked and the Dead, with moments of the action punctuated by moments of life, by anecdotes of individual parts of the game, player and spectator and city and ballpark, much in the same way Mailer interrupts war to tell the stories of the soldiers in his magnificent novel. But to the parts themselves: There's a young Wade Boggs and Cal Ripkin, Jr. There's the city of Pawtucket, and its strange ballpark, and its larger-than-life politicians. There's the wife convinced her husband's cheating on her, not playing baseball at this god-forsaken hour. There's the father and son who make a pact never to leave early on the night of this game. And then there's Dave Koza, a man who should be remembered as one of the great minor legends of the game, like Ralph Branca or Moonlight Graham. Koza's the hero, and a wonderfully American hero he is.That, then, is ultimately the end of this book. It's a truism to talk about baseball and America; but clich\u00e9 has some truth in it, no matter. If you meet a foreigner who wants to understand America, give them the Constitution, the Declaration, the Federalist Papers, Washington's farewell address, Jefferson's letters, Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanack, Douglass' Autobiography, Lincoln and Kennedy's inaugural speeches, and Patton's speech to the Third Army. And then, after all that, explain baseball to them, take them to a game, and during the seventh-inning stretch, give them this book. This is America in a nutshell. And what a beautiful thing it is."}, {"userName": "Daniel Currie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3130865-daniel-currie", "userReview": "I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway. Thanx!It sounds like an interesting premise and it is, but the execution...It is all about the longest game in organized baseball history. But the game itself was not that interesting. Only a few runs scored. There are some future Hall of Famers in the game, but they didn't play an integral part. Since there isn't that much of the game to write about (maybe 10% is about the actual game) it has to rely on the people and their backstories. It was obviously written knowing this is what the book would be about, not the game itself. But do we really want to know the backstory of the batboy, the owner, the coaches, the broadcaster, every player, their wives, the chairman of the league and (I am not kidding) the fans? I'm sorry, but their stories are what this book is built on and they simply aren't THAT interesting. You could take this slice of life of virtually any setting and expand upon it like this, but the bottom line is 'Is it interesting'?

In a 33 inning epic contest featuring two future Hall of Famers, and many more has-beens, each side would refuse to yield, finishing the game, Dan Barry argues, because they were \"duty bound\" and \"loyal\" to it.It was for similar reasons that I finished this book.Dan Barry uses the game to tell the fascinating stories of a select few men and boys who are forever bound to each other through this one small moment of baseball history. As the life story of each player unfolds, we feel the emotion of their triumphs and frustrations. From the players and umpires on the field, to the youthful batboys in each dugout, and extending even to the dozen or so fans who bravely watch the game into the wee hours of Easter Sunday, Barry's impressive research leaves no detail behind.Unfortunately, the wealth of information and facts seems more piled together than organized. While the book is divided up by innings (1-9, 10-21, 22-32, 33) there is little discernible order within that structure. As a new players comes to bat, Barry forces us to leave the game for several pages so he can tell us all about this man, only to drop us right back into the game once we've forgotten where we were. Overall, I found the stories thrilling and well told, but the poor organization of all those details created a confusing read - an impression cemented by the fact that several stories are told more than once. It's sad, really, that such a potentially great book could be undone by a confusing and poor structure, but that is exactly what happens here. Like a strapping power hitter who can't figure out the curveball, Bottom of the 33rd has all the potential in the world, but will never make it out of AAA."}, {"userName": "Alisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2738978-alisa", "userReview": "Outstanding book.

The book takes people who have the longest game in the history of professional baseball in common and weaves their stories together. It's a daunting assignment, the people are disparate; failing ballplayers, players on the way to the Hall of Fame, a local guy who forages for ticket stubs, a local kid who's worked his way up to be the clubhouse manager, wives, kids, owners, umpires and on. That's a lot of people to put into 350 pages let alone in context. The story succeeds in telling the stories over 30 years. Its more a story about the characters not the game.

If you like baseball or sports in general then you will find that this story will make you laugh outloud along the way. Oddly enough I feel to be a better person because I read this story.

This is the story of a mystical night that transcended baseball and entered the realm of philosophy. A poem about time, gifted to the world through a game.

At times, the plethora of characters and quick subject changes were difficult to field. Overall, a melancholy and wistful account of souls who loved a game, confined to the randomness of their circumstances, trying to make it as their abilities, commitment, and vision were thrown into stark relief on this most unlikely of nights.

How does one make a book about said game without alienating non-baseball fans? This is how: by weaving poignant, touching stories of literally nearly everyone involved in the game.

Here is the tale of the unique, self-made wealthy owner who values loyalty and elevates a downtrodden town's downtrodden ballpark and team to notoriety in the world of AAA baseball.

There are names that can be mistaken such as Joe Morgan. There are a host of unknowns that never made it.Barry gives us the background to the baseball field, the players and (for me as interesting) the support team including everyone from the ball boy to the statistician. In terms of big names, the game in question features Cal Ripken against Wade Boggs (both future members of the MLB Hall of Fame). Boggs is also a member of the \u201cmost superstitious\u201d hall of fame. According to several sources, he ate chicken before every game, woke up at the same time every day, took exactly 117 ground balls in pre-game practice, took batting practice at 5:17 pm, and ran sprints at 7:17 pm, to increase his chances of \"going 7-for-7\". His route to and from his position in the field beat a path to the home dugout. He drew the Hebrew word \"Chai\", meaning \"life\", in the batter\u2019s box before each at-bat, though he is not Jewish. He asked Fenway Park public address announcer not to say his uniform number when he introduced him because Boggs once broke out of a slump on a day when this guy forgot to announce his number. Cal Ripkin, Jr. was as dedicated to becoming one of the best. His long hours of batting practice were accepted as something he got from his father, at that time third base coach for the Baltimore Orioles. He was known as \u201cthe man of a thousand batting stances,\u201d never settling on one that he would use for very long. It took him a number of years to make it to the \u201cbig show,\u201d which makes his consecutive game record all the more impressive. Baseball is a game of study and reflection. So, maybe the longest game on record is the platform for leisurely reflection on the game called, \u201cAmerica\u2019s pastime.\u201dYou realize from the title that the game goes 33 innings. What Barry does, is to make you feel what it means to play or watch 33 innings. Arguably, the duration is toughest on a catcher. The catcher has to squat almost immobile in the cold wind, except to fire the ball back to the pitcher. Pawtucket\u2019s starting catcher was pulled after 9 innings. After twenty something innings the Rochester coach has been asking his starting catcher, Dave Huppert (a good field, no hit journeyman) if he is \u201ctired and in need of a break. But will the exhausted and hungry Huppert ever acknowledge to his manager that yeah, he\u2019s kind of beat and wouldn\u2019t mind coming out of the game?\u201cNever\u201cBecause who knows? At some point this season, or next, one last spot may need to be filled on the major-league team\u2019s roster. Or maybe, God forbid, Rick Dempsey gets injured, and the choice for a replacement comes down to Huppert and some other minor leaguer. Let\u2019s say they\u2019re both catchers, with good hands and weak bats. It\u2019s a toss-up, the powers that be are looking for reasons to pick one over the other, and someone says, \u2018Remember when Huppert asked out of a game that time?\u2019 No need for anyone to say quitter, or loser. The silence would say it for them, as the power that be move on to the next order of business\u2026\u201dBarry\u2019s enthusiasm for the side stories of this game is infectious. We learn about the stadium, the new owner, the old owners, the politics of Pawtucket, the \u201cmob\u201d and \u201cbusiness club\u201d influences. We are taken on excursions through many personal stories whose only viable link is that those people were, in some capacity, in that ballpark on that night.Maybe Barry\u2019s book is only for the true baseball fan. But for those, it is a reading pleasure.In the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle the next morning, the game story began, \"Not since the time they had to shoot the drunken camel at the city zoo has there been this much excitement in Pawtucket.\u201d And that\u2019s the way it was."}, {"userName": "Todd Stockslager", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager", "userReview": "Review title: Baseball sprung eternalOn the Saturday and Sunday of Easter 1981 the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings played the longest professional baseball game ever. Thirty years later Dan Barry retells the story of the game through the stories of its key participants: the future Hall of Famers (Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken, Jr.), the ones who finally made it to the show (Joe Morgan and Rich German), and those who toiled in obscurity in Pawtucket, Elmira, Winter Haven, and a hundred minor league stops in between without ever making it. Baseball is so popular as a literary subject in part because of its unique relationship with time. Baseball games are defined not by time elapsed but by milestones accomplished: three outs per half inning, each team one turn at bat per inning, nine innings per game, and extra innings played until a tie is broken. As Barry writes, a baseball game, even a single at bat, could theoretically last an infinity, and this game tested that theory to the greatest extent ever in its 33 innings and over 8 hours of play.Another aspect of baseball time is the length of the gestation period of a typical career. A player drafted out of high school or college may take three, four, five years or more to progress through the minors from rookie ball to AAA, establishing through the slow accretion of statistics over time the repeatability of his ability; Pawtucket manager Morgan used the term \"consistency\" to describe why the hero of The Longest Game never made it to the majors despite years of success in the minors. Yet somewhere along that path the unstoppable accretion of time turns a young man old in baseball years and he must make the realization or accept the inevitability of retirement. It is Barry's treatment of time that gives this the poignancy of the best books about this oddly timeless and time driven game.But it is a game, an event, and Barry also writes a highly readable account of this game as it unfolds over hours and days: the cold wind that chills the players hands and empties the stands as the game draws on, the plays and hits that resulted in scores tied at 1-1 and 2-2 (when each team scored a run in an inning in the 20s that raised and dashed hopes that the game may end soon), the attempts of players on the field and on the bench to stay engaged during the hundreds of at bats (and 60 strikeouts), and the reason why the game wasn't suspended at the typical minor league curfew.Barry calls this a \"non-baseball baseball book\" and uses the framework of the game to write a history and a story of a time, place, people, culture, and language--and of the Christianity symbolized by the celebration of Easter Sunday and the faith professed and lived by several of the players. Baseball does this to writers, and in this case, in a good way. One tie to the timelessness of baseball and to its literary reach: Steve Grilli who took the loss in the game, near the end of a career in which he had made the majors but would not reach them again, is the father of Jason Grilli, the aging relief pitcher who found new life as the closer for my favorite Pittsburgh Pirates."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth S", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/891566-elizabeth-s", "userReview": "This was a difficult book to rate. Seldom have I felt such a need for half stars, or maybe a different set of stars for various parts. The storytelling on the individual vignettes was superb. I'm not surprised to see that the author writes for a newspaper. Each story is drama, words are carefully chosen, each word seems to have maximum impact. I feel emotionally involved with all the characters, even the people who only get a paragraph of story. Now for the downsides. Writing a book about a game, even a long game, is not easy. To just tell the story of the game would be... as boring as some people think baseball really is. (What do they know?) So I can understand the author's choice to intersperse the action of the game with the stories of various people connected with the game. But I frankly kept getting lost. Just during one infield pop-up, we got pages of background on each of the two guys vying for the ball. As I read, my son periodically asked me what inning I was in, and I seldom knew. For the first half of the book it was hard to keep track who we were talking about. Even if I remembered the guy's name, which team was he on? It would have helped immensely if there was a Cast of Characters at the beginning of the book listing the rosters of each team, the managers, owners, reporters, anyone who was worth giving more than a paragraph of background on. I saw that the box score was added at the end of the book in the final copy, and that is a good thing. But I wouldn't have wanted to refer to it as I read, because that would have spoiled the ending. (I like that we don't know who would win until we really get there.) I know language doesn't bother some people, but I don't much care for swearing. And there was a lot of f-word type swearing. Yes, I know that is how the players really talk. But I appreciate that the players don't usually say those words when being interviewed by the media. Maybe I shouldn't have expected a similar standard for the book.Back to positives, I loved to learn so much about baseball at the minor league level, so many mini-histories of players, so much tying it all together. I recommend this book for anyone with a love of the game. How much should you love it? If you know who Wade Boggs and Cal Ripkin, Jr. are without needing google, if when someone says \"Sox\" your first thought is Boston or Chicago, if \"Cooperstown\" doesn't sound like a brand of shoes to you, then you'll love this book. If not, you may want to learn enough about baseball first, so you can thoroughly appreciate what Dan Barry has done in telling the saga of the longest game ever."}, {"userName": "Charly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/584414-charly", "userReview": "This was an absolutely wonderful approach to a wonderful story.

His approach of stepping aside from the narrative of the game to tell how a given player got to that point in the game and where he would go from there, was wonderful.To have been at Mc Coy in the pre-Ben Mondor era, and having purchased this book at the current jewel of a AAA stadium that Mc Coy has become shows the blessing to baseball that Mondor was. Also, it allowed me to really feel the wind blowing in on that night, as it did at many an early season game then and now. My wife and I came within a whisker of going to this game as a Saturday night out with another couple. I lost the vote and didn't know until the next morning what we missed or I guess avoided. To know some of the people quoted in the book makes a very real portrayal even more real.A wonderful read for anyone and a must read for a baseball fan.

He is like a color commentator for this game, describing the people in the stands, the ball players, the owner, all their wives and kids, the batboy, and on. He mentions the teams burned old bats to keep warm quite during the game a few times (maybe 5 times -- that's too repetitive). It was a lot like watching an 8 hour game would have been on TV, you start realizing you are hearing the same things over again. This all makes it a little boring. But this is minor league baseball, and stories of the characters in minor league baseball can contain interest, especially when comparing to the majors and knowing that not everyone will make it to that promised land. He picks a doozy of a game to write about, with future hall of famers and long-time major leaguers in the game, and where the hero of the game never makes it up to the majors.

Even the stadium plays a part in this book!Most people know how challenging it is for players, even the most talented players, to make it to the big leauges.
