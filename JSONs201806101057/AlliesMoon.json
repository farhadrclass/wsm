I'll probably try this author again, if only for the better than average writing style."}, {"userName": "Ridley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2543252-ridley", "userReview": "Wow! This was very nearly a five-star read for me. It's like a 4.75. Loved Allie and Jeff, adored their story and was super impressed at how Harrington wrote the antagonists. It's the third book I've read by this author (after Harper's Bride and Desperate Hearts) and I liked it much more than either of them.Left in charge of the family farm and her addled sister after her father's death, Althea Ford is overworked and overwhelmed. Against her better judgement, but desperate for the help, she's walked to town to hire the local drunken bully to fix her roof and plant her garden. When he doesn't show up for the job the next day, as they had agreed, she complains to the local sheriff. Her roof leaks, time's ticking on garden planting and she just can't hack it alone anymore.Completing his fall from sheriff to drunken vagrant, Jefferson Hicks is on the other side of the bars in the local jail after getting caught stealing an egg from a local farmer. Plagued by nightmares from a shooting that left a boy dead and abandoned by his wife, Jeff has sought oblivion at the bottom of a bottle for the past two years. Now at rock bottom, the current sheriff gives him an option - stay in jail for a month, or live and work on the Fords' farm for the rest of the growing season.Both Althea and Jefferson are terribly burdened souls. Though very different people, both carry weighty guilt on their shoulders for the deaths of people close to them. Jeff is tormented by the night he shot a local boy he'd taken under his wing, and Althea by her mother's suicide when Althea was a little girl. They mirror each other in how they react to this guilt. Althea tries to atone by dedicating her life to the farm and her sister, and Jeff goes the other way entirely by running away from all of his responsibilities and cares until he barely cares if he lives or dies.So, the book is about two wounded souls shoring the other up. Responsible, demanding Althea the employer forces Jeff to sober up and redeem himself through an honest day's work. The old lawman in Jeff begs Allie to address the injustices in her life and believe she deserves happiness. Apart, they're both victims of their own consciences. Together, they're able to unravel the other's problems and stand as stronger individuals.I enjoyed watching the characters grow in this way. You see Jeff as a straight-up drunk at the novel's beginning. He's filthy, he's scrawny and his hands shake so bad, he hasn't written to his own mother in years. Harrington doesn't make a major plot point of his alcoholism, but she still treats it with the proper respect. Throughout the book, you see him battle the temptation to drink, though he doesn't relapse, so it's not dispensed with in a facile manner. Althea starts the novel a slave to her father's memory and her sister's whims, working hard for everyone but herself. She's unhappy, worn out and tired.Watching these two slowly find their happiness was incredibly satisfying in the face of their troubles. This is definitely a romance in the slow-burning department. They share only a few rather chaste kisses before the only sex scene happens at about 85% of the way in. I thought that the subdued, deliberate pace worked for the characters. In place of heated embraces and frequent makeouts, Jeff and Allie talked. Before they fell in love, they formed a friendship. And perhaps because of the long build-up, their night together was all the more heartfelt and emotional. It was an act of love rather than just physical attraction.I also found the antagonists cleverly written. We start off with one villain, the mean drunk father of the boy Jeff shot, then end up with another villain in Althea's sister. I liked how they had understandable, if not sympathetic, motivations and how their mischief was so well tied up with Allie's and Jeff's character growth. They didn't just provide external conflict to put the HEA on hold, they made the HEA possible.Having rambled on quite long enough, I'll wrap it up here. Although it had a few spots of over-obvious foreshadowing and lacked the transcendent sparkle of an amazing book, it was damn close to a five-star read for me. If you like emotional, redemptive romance in a historical western setting, this is a wonderful read."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "[ The fact that she was willing to let a man hang for something he was innocent of put a bad taste in my mouth  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3919132-linda", "userReview": "Althea Ford, 'Allie', is one of two sisters that was left the family farm. Before her father passed away he made her feel that all the bad things that happened to the farm were her fault. She felt guilty from things that were beyond her control. Her younger sister, Olivia, played this dilemma to the hilt. Allie was at wit's end when the local sheriff brought her a proposal. The previous sheriff, Jefferson Hicks, had become the town drunk. At one time Hicks had it all until he mistakenly killed a young boy. His wife left him and because he couldn't abandon his nightmares he lost his job to the drinking. Caught stealing he was given a choice: work at the Fords' farm for the rest of the season or go to jail.Allie and Jefferson were two damaged individuals who had a difficult time letting go of the past. Each tried to make amends for their 'sins' through different means. Allie put every burden on her shoulders. Besides trying to complete all the physical work it took to running a farm she became a nanny and maid to her younger sister. An enabler before the word became popular, she thought she was doing her best for Olivia.Jefferson was the opposite. He couldn't make up for the wrong he did so he took to drinking. When he was offered help he drank some more. Finally, he reached rock bottom. He didn't care anymore what happened and he was ready to die.These were two souls that screamed for forgiveness. It was hard to imagine why Allie allowed her sister to treat her so shabby except that she had extremely low self-esteem. Jefferson allowed her to see an honest picture of what Olivia was and it wasn't pretty. Allie held Jefferson to a higher level, something no one had done in a very long time. While still very much a romance the author did a respectable job showing what alcohol can do to relationships. The slower pace of their friendship first was realistic. They helped each other look beyond their immediate problems and see that they needed each other in more ways than one. If ever a HEA was deserved it was for these two individuals. If you enjoy an emotional journey with fractured characters this story if for you."}, {"userName": "Mary B.

Known by the townsfolk of Decker Prairie, Oregon as the 'Crazy Ford Sisters,' the two young women live a life of virtual isolation out on their untended farm, where they are haunted by painful ghosts from the past. Jefferson Hicks is an ex-Sheriff who descends into a deep depression and alcoholic haze after shooting a teenaged boy in self-defense. Having lost his sobriety, his wife, and his will to live, Jeff becomes the town's #1 derelict and most undesirable citizen. Then one day, the new Sheriff arrests Jeff for stealing and egg, and offers him an opportunity to work for Allie on the Ford farm in lieu of spending a month in jail. As Jeff sobers up and cleans up (both figuratively and literally), he grows closer to Allie. Soon, his old self reemerges and his vitality and self-respect return. As Allie begins to see the goodness in Jeff, as well as herself, a slow-burning, yet intense passion and love develop between them. Outside forces are working against them, however, and Allie and Jeff must hold on to the strength they have found in one another if their happiness is to survive. One of my very favorite elements in a good romance is a tortured and downtrodden hero and heroine, who have been badly burned by their pasts but find strength in one another. Fortunately, this is also the type of character Alexis Harrington seems to really enjoy creating. And she does it very well. I loved Allie and Jeff, and I loved that they leaned on and supported one another when neither had anybody else in the world.Another aspect of Ms. Harrington's writing that I love is her ability to create deliciously thick sexual tension that leads up to very emotional and explosive love scenes, and yet still give the whole story a sense of purity and sweetness that really warms the reader's heart.Allie's Moon is the fourth book by this author I've read, and although it certainly isn't my favorite (Homeward Hearts takes that prize), it is still a very satisfying read."}, {"userName": "Noelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3451611-noelle", "userReview": "There is just something about a story that has such tortured characters that pulls at the heart strings. These two were so broken emotionaly that it was pretty hard to see how they would ever become whole again but Alexis Harrington has such a way with writing that she made it very believable. She didn't just have Allie and Jeff fall in love at first sight and BAM! everythings all better, no they had to take baby steps and for every two steps forward there would be a few steps backwards. I think that's why it felt so real to me.Oh and the sister....

It was pretty good. It had a slight dark feel to it probably because of the dark issues it contained. I'm not a fan of romances that involve alcoholism.

Nothing in her life has changed or occurred to deter her hateful, manipulative, self serving mind set until Jefferson is plopped into their lives.The way the story unravels is emotional and drew me right in.

Though Jeff opened Allie's eyes to her sister's nefarious actions, and to the fact that she was not sick at all, Allie continued to accept her sister treating her badly as her due. At that point the self-sacrificing heroine became another type of character: the TSTL heroine.2) The other thing that I disliked immensely is the fact that if the author centered so much of the conflict with the sister as a villain, could we at least have seen her get her comeuppance? After proven that Olivia had been lying in court, we get an epilogue quickly and barely a mention of Olivia at the end.

No one has responded to her ad and, desperate, she must brave the curious looks and whispers as she prepares to hire a disreputable man to help her. She knows the things the townspeople say about her and the sister she cares for, not to mention the careless comments about her mother. They\u2019re the crazy Ford sisters, and their mother committed suicide when Olivia was a baby. But crazy or no, Althea\u2019s desperation forces her to act.Former sheriff Jefferson Hicks has hit the skids following a shooting where a young boy was killed. He can\u2019t forget, and the memory haunts him to the point he finds solace in a whiskey bottle. When he is caught stealing an egg, his former friend, the current sheriff, makes a deal with Jeff that he work off his sentence at the Ford farm.Jeff expects the Ford sisters to be old and a bit touched, but he\u2019s surprised to find Althea a lovely woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The first days are difficult: Jeff is dirty and unkempt, and he wants a drink more than anything, but he is a man of his word. After cleaning up, he submits to a haircut and some fresh clothes.Althea is a stern taskmistress, but she finds Mr. Hicks a good worker and an attractive man. As time goes on, Jeff begins to find purpose in his life, but it is rough going, especially when he also discovers he is beginning to have feelings for Althea, whom he nicknames Allie.Incidents occur that try their fragile trust, and Jeff discovers Allie\u2019s sister Olivia is not the sick, half-child she pretends to be. Getting Allie to see it proves difficult, but as one thing after another happens, Allie begins to suspect Jeff is telling the truth.This is a warm and wonderful story about the redemptive power of love and of two damaged individuals who are finally given a second chance at happiness. Both Allie and Jeff are people the reader cares about. Ms. Harrington has executed a plot with many nuances\u2013darkness, manipulation, despair, and as said before, the redemptive power of love.I, too, was reminded of The Bad Seed, as another reviewer commented.

She is stuck with \"raising\" her 20 year old sister (who behave like a child) and carries some scars from her past.Jeff was the town Sheriff till one night changed everything for him and he became alcoholic and homeless. Jeff is assigned (as a punishment) to fix Allie's place and slowly they start fixing each other.I liked the beginning, it almost felt like Morning Glory (which I adore) but then it became a little bit unrealistic...

What a sweet book about two people both who have been dealt a hard hand in life coming together and falling in love so they can finally have happiness. Both Althea and Jeff had their troubles, she was looking after her manipulative and evil sister and Jeff was an alcoholic; turning to the bottle after a tragic event. Together they were a great couple and I loved reading them start to trust one another against all the odds and outside forces. With romance books, a lot of the times the \"bad guys\" are a little...meh. But what has stood out for me in Allie's Moon and what I will probably remember most is the evil sister. She was selfish and manipulative and would literally do anything to get her way, without thought or remorse to how it would effect her sister. It was chilling to read, although frustrating when everyone else could see this apart from Allie. This was a good book, sweet, romantic with a cast of characters I liked, or loved to hate.

I don't know, I really couldn't stand our heroine Allie, she bothered me. I cant even really pinpoint the why of it, except there was something about her that turned me off in comparison to other female leads in Harrington's books, and it made me almost put this book down. It was very slow moving in the beginning, she was just so uptight and restrictive, to herself and later Jeff when he came along. Not that his drunk a** probably didn't need the restrictive guidelines, LOL! But no, it all bothered me. Once I kept trucking thru the book it started getting more interesting, I figured out early on what was going on with her little sister, but was pleasantly surprised by what was revealed to had taken place after the events surrounding her mom and why she was so uptight(not that that made me like her more or any less critical of her;-) Overall it was a decent read, it didn't take me long to read it once I set my mind to it, but this isn't a book I'd jump up and down shouting to everyone \"YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!\" I think you'd be better off reading one of her other books instead, Allie's Moon was ok, but not one that will resonate with me like the Bridal Veil or Harper's Bride, I was actually glad to just be finished with it and not quitting less than half way thru it.
