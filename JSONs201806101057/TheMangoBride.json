She had become, as her mother said, one of those people with nothing to lose. The Mango Bride is a faithful and heartrending story about the many facets of Filipino diaspora. The story-telling timbre of The Mango Bride is something you\u2019d usually observed in a teleserye. There is a heavy emphasis on familial responsibilities, our conservative and somewhat limiting values and of course, food. This book touches a lot of things most of us \u2013 Filipinos shy away from, such as anti-blackness (racism, colorism), the hierarchy within our nation, abortion and premarital sex, migration, poverty and more. I like the pacing of the plot, though I find some of the particular scenes boring. Hence, a less star. And, I have to admit Soliven has a knack of crafting well written characters with plenty of dimension to explore.Highly recommended to Filipino readers who want to reconnect with their roots and to everyone who\u2019s looking for a harrowing story about reality.P.S. I was highly entertained with the random Tagalog phrases."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "After hearing Marivi Soliven speak at a San Diego County Library author talk, and being enthralled -listening as she read from her novel and then expounded upon her personal life story and that of other Philippine-American women in conjunction with Philippine-American relations, immigration hurdles, mail-order-bride realities, assimilation into a new culture, and domestic abuse - I greatly looked forward to reading The Mango Bride. Several times I picked up this culture-rich, multifaceted novel and attempted to read it through. But I had trouble gelling with the way in which its told - fractured formatting, toggling between time and place and multiple characters, sans fluidity and often without clearly-notated divisions. Non-linear formatting seems to be a current trend in the publishing industry when it comes to novels. Which, to a degree, is fine. It can compress an otherwise complicated tale or long drawn-out saga into a more compact story for time-challenged readers. In this case, however, whoever chose to deviate from a linear story-line (author or editor or publisher) really butchered it; certainly not doing justice to this culture-rich, cautionary awareness, immigration story of duality. Plus, the frequent insertion of Tagalog commentary further impeded fluidity and continuity.The other elements that hampered my reading enjoyment have more to do with personal tastes. I'm not a fan of soap-operas. THE MANGO BRIDE wasn't overly saturated with melodrama, but like a lingering scent of \"White Diamonds\" after passing a perfume counter, it hangs in the air. As for rating this book, I can't, with sincere honesty, give more than two stars. There are three and four star moments. Some passages and story elements really touched my heart. But the formatting issues and other elements were so unappealing and frustrating, the overall effect was an utter killjoy. And that makes me quite sad for Ms. Soliven. She's such a delightful and enthralling woman and speaker."}, {"userName": "Sandie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331967-sandie", "userReview": "In THE MANGO BRIDE you will be introduced to a variety of women from different generations and divergent social classes, some who remain in their native Philippines and others who, for a variety of reasons, leave to begin new lives in the United States. One of these women is Concha, the matriarch of a prominent Filipino family, is more concerned with what the neighbors will think and how her family's status in the community will be negatively affected than with the protection and welfare of her family members. Another is Clara, an impoverished young woman who is seen as an unsuitable mate for the scion of a wealthy family. The fallout of their individual actions and a decades old scandal culminates in Oakland, California when the paths of the offspring of these two women cross with unexpected and tragic results.Addressed by the author, Marivi Soliven, are questions like: What is it that constitutes real freedom and is it more difficult for a woman to achieve than a man because of economic obstacles? Is love and concern for another human being what embodies and epitomizes the true definition of \"family\"? How often does the pursuit of a dream have unanticipated and nightmarish consequences? This is a family saga containing a myriad of components that run the gamut from immigration, mail order brides, social prejudice and class conflict to veteran's issues, domestic violence and the problems of assimilation. While possessing some soap opera undertones and a lack of explanation as to the meaning of some of the Tagalog phrases used, I nevertheless found THE MANGO BRIDE to be an absorbing and thought provoking read that presented an informative and exhaustive look at the Filipino culture.If you are a fan of the works of storytellers like Jennifer Haigh, Kate Morton, Alan Brennert, Erika Roebuck or Thrity Umrigar then Marivi Soliven's THE MANGO BRIDE should be the next book added to your TBR list."}, {"userName": "Ana Valenzuela", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/373058-ana-valenzuela", "userReview": "A good read. I was already concocting the ending in my head, but it had a different twist. Poor Beverly, but this just reflects the harsh realities of life which I hope most of us will never experience.I was having problems with the Tagalog words used, as there will often (about 80% of the time) be an English translation in the next sentence. This just breaks the flow, seems redundant. Hope this has a version with no more translations. Also, I think the editor failed to notice some errors on who the narrator was talking about. Such as Amparo being referred to repeatedly as Carina's niece, when in fact they are not blood relatives, but only godmother-goddaughter. This could have passed, if Amparo was dating Carina's nephew Matteo. Near the end, there was a passage I had to reread again as it said sister instead of daughter. There are many other things that the editor missed."}, {"userName": "WriterLadyNYC", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7266455-writerladynyc", "userReview": "I read an uncorrected proof version so there were a few things I would change but they were very minor.

I liked the language switch from English to Filipino, it made it feel very realistic and personal.

This is the central issue in The Mango Bride which is the story of several characters forced to leave the Philippines and live in Oakland, California in 1995. But the story is so, so much more. It begins with Marcela the cook/maid stabbing Senora Concha, the mother of Ampara and her brothers. There\u2019s a sense of magical realism in the initial scene, with few clues to indicate why Marcela has snapped. But everyone in the family is cautious and careful and won\u2019t even consider calling the police. She gets medical attention from her son, the dermatologist, and all seems forgotten as the story switches to Ampara whose mother made her emigrate to America for a shameful secret that no one is supposed to know but everyone does.Ampara\u2019s point of view appears as she is a translator, taking care of her home and answering the telephone to do her job translating for police and social workers in Oakland. Chapters follow with Filipinos living in California, a viciously abused woman, a women who is carrying an unwanted pregnancy, and so many more tales. What is most striking about these suffering women is the loneliness of American life for them and their painfully raw nostalgia for their native home. Ampara tries to stay neutral but one story in particular sets off her own painfully poignant memories. When she meets her Uncle several times, a recovering alcohol holding his own secrets, he is reluctant to address the issues and secrets Ampara knows he is harboring. She has a solid relationship with a new boyfriend and wouldn\u2019t consider leaving but her heart aches for her mother, no not Senora Concha but Marcela who acted as her \u201creal\u201d mother for some odd reason most of Ampara\u2019s life. Marcela realizes she needs to catch up with connecting with her children but her fear of scandal is larger than her maternal instincts. We will later know why and the immense consequences of that secret.We also meet Beverly, a maid who is cousin to Ampara, who has her own awful story regarding her deceased mother and her present issues as the wife of a white man who treats her like a dog and will even try to ship her back home \u2013 for good! She is actually more of a central character than Ampara because Beverly\u2019s story parallels the story of so many young Filipino woman in America.This notable novel almost defies description. Loyalty, family, gender roles, gender abuse, betrayal, revelation, repentance are just a few of the topics that these potent scenes address and which one appreciates as a sign of the immigrant and cultural experiences herein that one has never previously realized. If you, the reader, are not there, this book will amaze you; if you, the reader relate, there is comfort, truth and healing herein. Finely crafted novel and superb contemporary fiction, Marivi Soliven! Great read!"}, {"userName": "sj", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51084309-sj", "userReview": "I'm breaking this book through two parts: plot and structure.PLOT:Beverly and Amparo meet in California under circumstances that could be considered worthy of a Filipino soap opera, minus the abortion censors. Although all the convoluted relationships stayed within a circle of other relationships, such is the tight-knit clan of Duarte-Guerrero, it all still became quite cliche, within Filipino standards.Men in this book are sinful, and I don't mean that in the sexy kind of way. Mateo, Fico, Aldo, Lydell, Josiah? Just, unnecessarily bad examples of bad people in life, be it white old veteran creeps or adulterers or heartless lovers. The only respectable men in this book are either in America (minus Josiah):Seamus, the Chess Manongs (as I like to call them), Aldo Guerrero (at some extent) or is Rodrigo Guerrero.The women of the Guerrero house? Pretty much bitchy version 5.0. Concha and Lupita had no reason to be that bitchy, as far as I know, not a lot of spoiled people in this country are that bitchy, going so far as being so irrationally upset about high society and gossip. Marcela is pretty much everyone's mother, and I like her for it but not enough to give this book another star, because the summary says that it's about Amparo and Beverly, but the outcome is literally about Marcela and her sister, Clara. Both Amparo and Bev made some pretty dumb decisions because of their ambitions, but they redeemed themselves. Well, Amparo did.I also have a long-standing hatred for gay men portrayed as beauty queens in PH mediaSTRUCTURE:This could have gone better with less anecdotes. It would have ended earlier, but that could have given the author time to actually plan the purpose of this book through and through. The anecdotes just stretched this out too much, and context clues were already given. It's the same way with the Filipino words in the story, but that's actually helpful. If you mention the event already, you can move on without further expanding on the event unless you need the event to portray something important.The time line is really hard to follow too, considering that the prologue happens after the third to the last chapter of the book. So , yeah.OVERALL:It's an okay book because it's kind of educational on the side of history where mail-order brides were a thing, and traces of Filipino behavior immediately after Marcos. It's an okay book because it actually kept me going until I finished it. It's an okay book because maybe I just don't like adult novels but like the concept that this one gave me.But it's just an okay book. It's not amazing or mind-blowing, or even at all that engaging. It's long-winded and just this side of cliche."}, {"userName": "Noelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33243640-noelle", "userReview": "ACTUAL RATING: 5/5 stars.BOOK COVER/DESIGN: 8/10 stars. The cover - and the font used for the synopsis - was elegant and nicely done.GENERAL REVIEW/THOUGHTS: I love reading Filipino stories. The well - written ones, of course unlike the declasse ones written by jeje Filipino authors on Wattpad. Sadly, the last Filipino story - stories, rather - I've read that isn't school - related is The Myths and Legends of the Philippines by Marlene Aguilar. The writer, Marivi Soliven, was at UST some years ago to host a talk about her book. I was intrigued by the synopsis and I decided to purchase the book. And this did not disappoint me. It was absolutely brilliant! I loved how the characters were relate-able; one would easily relate to their lives no matter what social strata you belong to. I love how the author depicts life in Manila accurately - from the Filipino masses, to the food, to the environment, to the weather, and to dreams and yearnings. Life in America was depicted well, too. Having lived in New York City for a number of months, I was transported back to America when I read this. This book raises issues on women's rights and domestic abuse and it was so well - narrated that I found myself fighting back tears. Although I come from a family that closely resembles the Duarte - Guerrero clan, I was still able to relate myself to the Obejas family. I am glad that the story ended with a happy ending. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend this to any Filipino - whether residing in Manila or abroad - as this will surely warm their hearts. I should read more books by Filipino authors.

The book is the story of two Filipinas with two very different lives in the US but their lives are inexplicably intertwined. I love Marivi Soliven's writing especially as she has interspersed Tagalog words in the conversations, making it more authentic, the emotions very real and familiar to us Filipinos. I also love that the Filipino culture was highlighted (in food, practices at home and others, UP life - I personally love this as I'm an alumna.) I feel that the author truly deserved the Palanca Writing Award. The story flows smoothly, with very interesting snippets of the lives of our kababayans abroad seeking the good life with very familiar outcomes. I can't help but marvel at their bravery and resolve to overcome challenges with optimism and hope. The revelation chapters were well written however I wished that some characters had more development specifically Senora Concha, the matriarch of the Guerrero clan.

Mango Bride was a gem to read.This soap opera-like novel eventually comes full circle, focusing on the lives of the rich Guerrero family and the Obejas women. The story starts with a mystery--why did the Guerrero's trusted cook Nanay Marcela stab the bitchy matriarch Senora Concha during breakfast? We are then launched into the history of the clan, answering questions along the way. Why is Concha's daughter Amparo exiled in the United States with her Uncle Aldo? What is Marcela's role within the family, besides being their cook? Who is Beverly?The story tackled women's issues in the late 80's and early 90's, as well as explored the diaspora of Filipinos immigrants. We are introduced to multi-faceted characters such as Manong Del, whom Amparo befriended on the train; Josiah Stein; Lisa and her fiance Lydell; Mateo and Seamus, among others.

I've read so much fiction about the immigrant experience set in India and China, it was really interesting to read a novel where part of the story takes place in the Philippines and the rest is about Philippine immigrants in the US.The story is about two women, seemingly unrelated although as the book continues their stories end up intertwining. One is the daughter of a high-class family in Manila, the other the niece of a housekeeper, also in Manila. Both women find themselves in Oakland, California, far away from home for different reasons.Class played a very strong role in this book - particularly in Manila, the comparisons between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots\" was sharp.

The one thing that really bothered me was the man who is labeled as a Mormon who definitely does not embody Mormon beliefs. Sadly though, I guess this \"mormon man\" contributed to the theme of a person putting on a show for the world while being a totally different person inside.
