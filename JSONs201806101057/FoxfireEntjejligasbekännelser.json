I mean, there is the obvious reason why, which is that it's about a girl gang that targets predatory men and boys - and of course, horrible pet shops - with a sense of prefeminist vengeance. Feminist vigilantism appeals to me on this base, primal level, even if I have problems with violence in general. The book said a lot about the time and place in which everything took place. The sharp class divides, the social instability left behind in the wake of World War II (which is interesting considering that popular history says otherwise), the racism that existed even among the poorest, most outcast white girls, the Red baiting, Legs' proto-socialist tendencies, the power of the cult of personality, it goes on and on. And each time I read it - this would be my third - I take something new away from it. This time there were two things. One, I thought about how often it seems like writers use bookish, slightly introverted, observant characters - which seems to describe the personalities writers often have - as their narrators. It's like, no matter how imaginative the writer may be, they still need to enter their stories through someone who is like themselves. I don't know if that makes sense, as I am writing this in bits and pieces, but it's just something I've noticed a lot lately.The other thing I thought about was Oates' description of Legs' time in solitary, and how well it matched up with this New Yorker article I had just read about the use of solitary in American prisons, and the way depriving prisoners of human contact can twist and break even the most headstrong mind. There's more, but I don't want to clog up anyone's email with more of my barely formed ramblings."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1703160-renee", "userReview": "Foxfire is the book that impacted me the most in Middle school. Take that as you must, but I'm happy to see that, unlike The Catcher in the Rye, it holds up reading it with adult eyes. Of course, now, 10 years older than the last time I read it, I find issues with some of the characters I loved as a teenager, but I can see a desperation and naivete I couldn't see before. This book is one of many that cements Oates into the the hall of fame of awesome American writers."}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/611080-carla", "userReview": "Foxfire never says die.I have a Tattoo, based from this Book and the Movie that followed,...that starred Angelina Jolie. ;)It's the story of a group of misfit girls, who fight back.

Not that Foxfire deals explicitly with music at any point, but Oates is able to distill that same electricity.The story is set in the 50s, but, except for a few scattered cultural markers, it could just as easily be set in the contemporary moment. And I read it in that context. Nothing felt put on, or \"for show.\" I've known women like the characters in this book, including some close friends I've gotten to know over the years. They are wild, and courageous, and vulnerable. Most importantly, Joyce is able, with her capital letters and italics, to make you feel the urgency teen drama. So if people want to debate the realness of her story, go for it; I'll simply say, well, it's real enough.Hard not to fantasize, after reading this book, about what it would have been like to have joined a gang.

But I\u2019m glad I finished it because it turns out it was fun to discuss it even if it wasn\u2019t fun to read. I don\u2019t like stream of consciousness writing; it always seems to me to be more interesting for the author than for the reader, and this was a case in point. The idea sounded good: a girl gang with a charismatic leader running rampant in 1950s upstate New York. Unfortunately the execution was pretty dull; skewed timelines, the narrator being referred to sometimes in the first person and sometimes in the third, rambling sentences and two-page-long paragraphs about nothing in particular (at one point there is an entire page devoted to listing out, verbatim, the rules and regulations of a juvenile detention centre). The book is a \u2018memoir\u2019 of Maddy Wirtz, a member of the FOXFIRE gang. It chronicles the rise and eventual demise of the group at the hands of their glorious leader Margaret \u2018Legs\u2019 Sadovsky. All of the girls have very poor, or non-existent, male role models and there are some horrific scenes of rape, sexual harassment and violence. Sadovsky realises (consciously or otherwise) that the way out of their abuse is female solidarity and collective action, which works\u2026 to a degree. Some people at the book club really enjoyed it and I think it probably comes down to whether you\u2019re a plot-driven person or not. I am, and the plot for me was too tangled and slow. I\u2019m glad I stuck with it but I wouldn\u2019t really recommend it.

Le nom de l'autrice ne m'\u00e9tait pas inconnu, et je savais son engagement f\u00e9ministe. Avec ce livre, elle signe un hommage fort aux filles et aux femmes, \u00e0 celles qu'on ne d\u00e9fend pas, \u00e0 celles qu'on laisse de c\u00f4t\u00e9, \u00e0 celles qui tentent de survivre, seules. Elle b\u00e2tit un gang de filles, d'adolescentes dures, qu'on imagine tout en angles, des filles qui ne veulent plus s'en laisser compter, qui revendiquent leur place dans ce monde qui ne privil\u00e9gie que les hommes et les gar\u00e7ons, que ce soit dans les gangs, chez les pauvres ou chez les riches. Ces filles, men\u00e9es par une leader qui est une de celles qu'on admire, vont changer le monde, changer leur monde et se donner l'importance qu'elles m\u00e9ritent. Et que dire de Legs, cette meneuse charismatique qui semble ne jamais douter et toujours savoir. C'est elle qui m\u00e8ne les filles, c'est elle qui sait, c'est elle qui les lib\u00e8re. Elle pense et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit par elle-m\u00eame, elle reste forte, intelligente et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, et elle partage son amour avec toutes ces femmes qui sont ses s\u0153urs, avec tous les d\u00e9sh\u00e9rit\u00e9s qui sont sa famille, la g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 chevill\u00e9e au corps.

L'homme appara\u00eet sous un jour peu reluisant, qu'il soit p\u00e8re, membre de la famille ou rival, car la force des filles les \u00e9crase et leur fait peur. Elles ont cess\u00e9 de se taire, elles ont cess\u00e9 de faire le dos rond, elles en ont eu marre de ne pas avoir leur part du g\u00e2teau, et elles ont d\u00e9construit les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes de genre qui choisissent arbitrairement les go\u00fbts, les droits et les devoirs de chacun en fonction de son sexe.

Here, Joyce Carol Oates is at her best. With such a young cast of characters Oates is at full liberty to show the smooth transition between social marginalization in childhood and an adult life that was far from ideal, a life of thievery. The links between poverty, social marginalization, institutionalization, and crime are clear to those who have experienced them. Never have I found a work of fiction that combines all these elements into such an enthralling and historically pertinent book.The portrait painted of Legs Sedovosky is so beautiful I wish I had known her. Strong willed, strong boned, and strong legged: Legs is stoic from the very beginning drawing others toward her with admiration and jealousy, flattery. Her bold confidence rivaled the leaders of the male gangs in town, she was the real thing. A gang leader with a purpose: to provide for her loved ones and defend the meek. She changed the hearts of those around her and inspired them through memory until the very end. Let Legs inspire you as well and be bold in what you do. Never back down, be who you really are \"Foxfire never forgets\" and neither will the next person you inspire."}, {"userName": "Mar\u00eda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11447107-mar-a", "userReview": "La gran literatura tiene algo que te cautiva y te conmueve y te calienta los huesos.

Often written in Oates' semi-stream-of-consciousness style (with the attendant lack of punctuation), it takes the reader on a wild adolescent ride with (as always) some points of social commentary along the way. It certainly provides its own irreverant take on \"the sisterhood is powerful.\" As was the case with Oates' \"Man Crazy\" (though perhaps, I think, a little less so), this book may not be to everyone's taste. But for me, it was perfect."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/420196-elizabeth", "userReview": "Foxfire is a book that read itself. At first, I found the choppy stream-of-consciousness style hard to deal with. I had to re-read the first few pages several times. But after the first third, or so, I began to get a feel for the odd prose style. The run-on sentences, capital letters, and lack of punctuation dragged my eye across the page and made the book very difficult to put down. I read most of the last two hundred pages in a single sitting and can\u2019t remember the last time I finished a book so quickly. Foxfire is many things. It is at once a blistering critique of the status of women in post-World War Two America, a coming-of-age novel, the thrilling, action-packed saga of a girl-gang in poor, working-class New York, and (above all) a portrait of Margaret \u201cLegs\u201d Sadovsky. The book succeeds on all fronts, but the depiction of Legs (and her motivations) is what has stayed with me most after reading it. In many ways, Legs is as multi-faceted as the book itself. At once courageous and na\u00efve, she is an undying proponent of individuality and freedom. Throughout the book, she spouts socialist phrases and ideologies, although she has no understanding of what any of it actually means, and experiments with commonly accepted paradigms of gender and power. (One scene, in which she unexpectedly discovers sexual power while dressing up as a man for a job interview is one of the most memorable and surreal episodes of the entire book.) Though Foxfire is narrated by the quieter, bookish Maddie Wirtz, it is unquestionably Legs\u2019 story. The Foxfire gang is her creation and Legs becomes an odd combination of bully and mother-hen to the group of lost girls that fall under her charge. Think of Legs as a sort of female Peter Pan; the working-class town of Hammond, New York is her Never-Never Land: a gigantic playground for female passion and imagination gone awry. Indeed, the story is told in a remarkable, childlike style with an emphasis on the visual. Some of the images seemed to pop right off the page and I remember thinking, as I read, that the book would make a great film. (I\u2019ve since heard that there is a Foxfire movie out there, starring Angelina Jolie. That surprised me, since I kept picturing Keira Knightly as Legs Sadovsky while reading the book.) One example of the book\u2019s emphasis on image is the heavenly motifs that pepper the text. Joyce Carol Oates emphasizes \u2018sky\u2019 and \u2018altitude\u2019 throughout the book. In fact, the sky seemed to take on an almost salvific quality for Maddie and Legs, the two main protagonists. Legs\u2019 interest in the heavens is established early on in the story, but both characters develop a pattern of looking upwards whenever they wish to escape their dreary, Earth-bound circumstances. One example is a memorable scene in which Legs climbs up a tall water tower to escape a seething crowd of male oppressors on Memorial Day Weekend. Later on, while stuck in an isolation ward in prison, she finds solace watching a group of hawks circle outside her window. In addition, Maddie also develops a fascination with stars and astronomy. She is pictured reading astronomy books throughout the story. At the end, it is revealed that she eventually became an astronomer\u2019s assistant and was (for a time) married to an astronomer, as well. While one can\u2019t be sure whether such repetition was intentional, Joyce Carol Oates strikes me as too deliberate a writer for the motifs to be entirely accidental. She is also a hugely prolific one. So far, I\u2019ve only read two of her novels: Foxfire and them, so I can\u2019t comment on how Foxfire compares to the rest of her ouvre. However, both novels have left me suitably impressed with the quality of Ms. Oates\u2019 writing and I look forward to exploring her body of work for many more years to come. Foxfire is by far my favorite of the two books. It\u2019s well worth reading, and offers taut prose, memorable characters, and a harrowing climax to anyone willing to slog through the first fifty pages. Some have complained that the book\u2019s male characters are weak and one-dimensional, but I didn\u2019t see that. It\u2019s true that men are unquestionably painted as the villains in Foxfire, but Ms. Oates seemed to be making an effort here to make the men well-rounded. Mr. Whitney Kellogg, the main male character, came across as downright nice compared to the male characters populating them. For these reasons, I recommend Foxfire: not only as a compelling story, but as a good introduction to Ms. Oates\u2019 body of work, as well."}, {"userName": "Marinechinaski", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31721352-marinechinaski", "userReview": "Son chicas y viven en la zona marginal de la ciudad a inicios de los cincuenta.

Within the first few pages I knew that the writing style wasn't for me. Those who know me know I am pretty Type A, and my brain likes things nice, neat, and logical. There are a few writers who can still engage me when they are jumping all over the place as long as I can see why. This for some reason was not one of those books. Another large problem that I just couldn't get past was the idea that as someone who has been wronged in a terrible way, as many of the girls and women are in the book, doesn't make it okay to use equal (or ever lesser) violence against others. All I could think is that in this place where the people are downtrodden, feel forgotten and neglected, using violence only further ensures that the cycle will continue on. That doesn't mean to just take rape and domestic abuse in stride, it does mean you have the right to protect yourself but not to put others down as much as you have been. It worries me that there are those who will read a book like this and misinterpret this as feminism that so many people are working towards; and it isn't. Feminism is about all people being equal and no one being oppressed; it is not women having the 'best seat at the table' just because of gender and oppressing men as men have oppressed women in the past.I was vacillating between 1 and 2 stars for my review, because despite my personal issues with the book I can see how it would have been an important piece for when it was written. I can also see that it really resonates with others.

Foxfire shows a first hand account on the struggle young girls faced during the 50's and 60's in America. I thought this novel was a very interesting read and informative of what a girl was faced with growing up in a lower middle class in New York State especially the day to day sexism. The book left me feeling blessed to be growing up in such a developed era for women, even though yet not everywhere in the world women are seen equal to men. However I thought the book created a purely negative image of men, as almost every male character is being portrayed as a constantly in need of sex, alcoholic, pedophile, pervert or simply cruel person. I think this books emphasizes the wrong definition of Feminism in my point of view. Feminism is putting women and men equal and not making one appear positive and the other one more negative.

I absolutely fell in love with this book, it didn't take long actually, (by the end of the back cover in the bookstore I had already given it my heart). It soon became everything I had always wanted it to be, without ever really knowing what I was even looking for. The writing itself is different, so excited and fast paced and descriptive, but I loved it; it is just another quality that adds to the ambiance this book delivers. At times, this writing style is so supportive to the setting that it feels like you're swimming with the adrenaline rushing through the characters veins. it works almost flawlessly. The characters capture you first with a childlike quasi-innocence that inevitably manifests into full on rebellious hell raising, something that can be read as cliche but has never been so captivating (at least to me). FOXFIRE proudly develops and promotes a deviousness and misandric personality, and their punk fearlessness is something I immediately and again hopelessly found myself fighting alongside of, especially against the never ending supply of sexist perverted disgusting man pigs they encountered.The fact that this story focuses on a girl gang in a time and place where such things were unheard of, let alone even daydreamed about, is undoubtably the main core of its appeal and awesomeness. The situations these girls are put into, teenagers, are unfortunately/fortunately a gritty reminder of what life is actually like in such a sexualized society to women, especially those growing through puberty, not just back then but even still today, these things that women and girls have to go through so scarring, so disgusting, so unfair, some that may never even see the light of day in conversation, but undoubtably happen regularly, even if unknowingly. Thinking about the sexism, double standards, and constant over sexualization still ingrained in our society genuinely makes me sick, and honestly I found FOXFIRE a perfect outlet for any and all violent frustrated and twisted Vendetta fantasies I can't help but visualize whenever I hear of sexual assault/harassment. (Okay, so I'm sure that wasn't the direct intention, but it is definitely effective.) On the less intense side of things physically... this story also intimately follows the birth and life and death of a friendship (and almost sibling relationship) and love (sometimes hate) between a group of outcasts that I can't help but also fall in love with, and I love that aspect of it too. And although it teases playfully (and even somewhat painfully) at something more, (ffs I shipped it so hard) it's enough to know that even with their lives pretty consistently put in danger, this group of misfit girls successfully(..) banded together to survive and thrive as something not only to be afraid of, but simply recognized, and respected. and that's pretty important. This book is a beautiful and eerily inspirational narrative of a world that was probably at one point a reality, but never told, and now here it is, a vulnerable and intimate account of this group of outcast troublemaking punks just out to survive in an entire society seemingly against them. It was truly a very awesome read, and something that I will no doubt pick up again in the future. I'm still in the high of its climax, almost a full day after I've put it down, and will naturally be going through its withdrawal in the upcoming week. yay."}, {"userName": "Shelbi Stogdill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48295569-shelbi-stogdill", "userReview": "Foxfire is an all out book of girl empowerment and feminism. Taken place in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s shortly after the 2nd World War. This book is written through the perspective of Maddy, who is 15 at the time the story is told and you later find out is an astronomer\u2019s assistant reliving the days, and often switches points of view. It took place a lower class setting next to an upper class society. Much like the views of a city on a hill. Foxfire is a gang in the lower class society, but the first all girl gang. The setting went along with the plot well being a gang in a lower class society and developed the fact that there are multiple gangs around. The plot was semi realistic for the time period, but was very interesting and well developed by the author. The descriptive words used almost made the scenes and characters real life. The characters were well developed and jam packed full of personality and description they were almost relatable to people you may know in real life. The author excelled in this aspect and really developed a message about sexual abuse and alcoholism. She showed that it was a problem back then and the true message came out when the group of girls tried to stand up for that not to happen ever again. Although this is where my only problem with the book arose, the lack of adequate portrayal of men in the book. I understand that the sexual abuse and alcoholism was popular with men during the time period but every single man portrayed in the book was that type of man, there would have been a few decent men back then and I think at least one portrayed would have helped this book excel even further with the message being conveyed throughout the story. There was Legs\u2019 who seemed to have the best relationship with Maddy and their friendship seemed almost real. The well developed characters really were an asset and without them the book would just be a story that someone read because they had to, the feelings would not be there. This book at times was confusing and may require some rereading because there are a lot of run on sentences, as well as the switching of 1st and 3rd person viewpoints. Although the run on sentences may sound like a problem, when reading this book it actually helps with the rough and raw side of the story. After you start reading you will not even notice they are there and it will not be a problem. This book is not for all readers because of the strong descriptive language the violence and some scenes described throughout the book make it intense. If you do not like violence or not found of the sexual abuse topic I would suggest not to read this book. At the same time I would suggest it to most people because it sends a strong message about girl empowerment and the story is told exceptionally."}, {"userName": "Amron Born", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48295683-amron-born", "userReview": "Foxfire is set in the 1950s, in a fictional city in New York. The girls living in this town are young, but they have already seen some of the horrors of the world they live in. The book is very purposely placed in the poorer parts of town, and the girls all come from lower class families who are all dealing with some pretty big issues, like abuse and alcoholism. This main setting is accompanied by the secondary setting of the richer families\u2019 large homes. These contrasting settings mirror the contrast in the classes, and make the struggles of working class families stand out. I thought that the way the plot is set up is a little strange. The plot seemed to be very distinctly divided up into sections. Legs\u2019 detainment serves as a divider between the rise and the fall of Foxfire. The \u2018rise\u2019 section seems to be disproportionately longer than the \u2018fall\u2019 section. Despite the slightly strange set-up, however, the actual plot of the book is very engaging, with its near constant action interrupted with discoveries about friendship, justice, and revenge. I think that the characters are pretty nicely developed. They\u2019re all very three-dimensional characters, who aren\u2019t all always very nice or pleasant. Characters aren\u2019t just shown as good or bad, everyone seems to be a little bit of both. There's no subtlety in this ploy, making characters very obviously realistic and human. Goldie, for example, is a member of the gang. She\u2019s loyal and passionate, but she\u2019s also very brash and she lashes out at her Foxfire sisters when things get tough. She\u2019s not a good person, she\u2019s a real person. Most of the characters are developed in this way, making them all relatable and authentic.This book was sometimes difficult to read, because of the mechanics of the writing. Maddy switches haphazardly between first person and third person points of view. I had trouble recognizing these shifts between point of view, which made reading this book much more complicated. The way the sentences are composed is also confusing, because of the use of extremely long sentences. The way sentences blend together in Maddy\u2019s fast-paced narrative forces a sense of excitement and eludes to the constant rush of emotions steering through the gang towards trouble. These aspects of the writing make the tone and overall feeling of the book very quick and fierce and the book itself is reminiscent of the symbolic flame of Foxfire; it burns bright and fast, and is over just as rapidly as it began. Overall, I really enjoyed reading Foxfire, and would recommend it for anyone looking for a little bit tougher read that still has some action and excitement to it."}, {"userName": "Sara Ann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19954005-sara-ann", "userReview": "Overall, I liked this book and found the characters believable and the story engaging.I liked Legs and Maddy. The other characters weren\u2019t developed enough for me to have feelings for, aside from pity for Rita, but not the sympathy or heartache you might have for someone you know or care about.Legs was my favorite character. She was independent, stoic, and headstrong, but still had the naivety and impulses of a teenager. She was a girl unchecked by adult reason or reassurance. She created her own world, ideas of justice, and life philosophy out of necessity. She wanted to bring order to the chaos of her life and to do the same for others like her. She didn\u2019t want to get a grip on the \u201clife\u2019s not fair\u201d philosophy. Instead, she wanted to make life fair. It made sense that other girls in similar situations would be drawn to her, and would be loyal to her, especially Maddy. Before Legs, Maddy felt unexceptional. I think she was drawn to Legs for many reasons, partly because Legs exuded the female strength her mother didn\u2019t. Her mother was weak and her father was dead. She needed confidence, and like most teenagers, craved family. Legs gave her direction and made her feel cared for and part of something. All the male characters were underdeveloped, but I thought it tied to the perspective of the narrator. She wasn\u2019t neutral and had no motive to describe boys or adults or their feelings. Males dismissed, took advantage of, and were condescending to the girls. Thus, they were the Others, the Enemy. Some of the imagery was vivid, such as the scenes with the dwarf-woman. I might be haunted by that for a while. I didn\u2019t mind the prose Oates used in Foxfire. It\u2019s not an example of proper grammar, which I\u2019m okay with. It made the girls more real to me and caused me to read with a sense of muddled, teenage-brained urgency. I would expect someone looking back on her teenage years to experience a flood of memories and emotions not easily expressed in good grammar. My only real complaint was the italics: overdone. I found the story believable, but the last third went much faster than the rest of the book and I didn\u2019t love the end."}, {"userName": "Lan-linh", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31233829-lan-linh", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates tries to break many gender stereotypes in the novel Foxfire; a girl gang that targets men and boys with violence and strength. The girls, Maddie, Legs, Goldie, Rita and Lana work together to seek revenge on the men in their lives who do them wrong. The novel was surprising due to the fact the girls go completely against the image society portrays for women while trying to fight for feminism.Though the plot and story line were interesting and easy to follow, it is the poor depiction of all male characters and the girl\u2019s negative and hopeless attitudes towards society that made the book less enjoyable to me. The constant violence, abuse and strong feminist ideals are what ultimately drove me away from the book. The girl\u2019s arguments and attempts at retaliation came off as very extreme ways to defend feminism and women\u2019s rights. It is almost hypocritical due to the fact that the girls are doing to the men what they did not want the men to do to them, which makes the idea of feminism appear flawed. In this instance, the girls imply that women are superior to men, which do not reflect the goals of feminism, which is gender equality. All the male characters in the novel are portrayed negatively (whether it be alcoholics, absent fathers, pedophiles etc.), which becomes redundant and it makes me wonder what men readers thought of how men were being portrayed in the novel. The girls push the feminist ideal to an extreme, perhaps casting a negative light on feminism as a whole.Overall, I was unable to see the validation of the events due to the fact they were told from the perspective of the girls in the group. Many of the events seemed too \u201crough and tumble\u201d to all be true, especially when put together. What distracted me the most was the poor presentation of men and the extreme views of the female characters, it made it seem as though the events in the story had been over-exaggerated just to prove a specific \u201cfeminist\u201d ideal."}, {"userName": "John Rikhtegar", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31238510-john-rikhtegar", "userReview": "Surprisingly, I very much so enjoyed reading 'Foxfire' by Joyce Carol Oates. At times, perhaps the themes and underlining meanings were a little repetitive, but overall I was definitely pleasantly surprised. This novel is set in the 1950's-1960's and shows the harsh and unfair times that women were forced to live in. This novel is shows the adventure of some teenage girls who decide to fight what they believe in, through means of radical physical and emotional abuse. Legs, Maddy, Rita and Goldie are some of the first Foxfire gang members and swear to secrecy that they will never tell anyone about their gang and the purpose behind it. What is the purpose of the gang you may ask? Well, it is simply to fight against males and fight for communalism amongst their people. The foxfire members believe that they have been always been treated unfairly, whether in school or even by family members, and it is up to them to take a stand against society. This time was also a very racist time and the social status and wealth between the Whites and the Blacks were significant. The most powerful scene in the novel to me, was when Legs brought two of her friends from prison, to the Foxfire home so that they could live the Foxfire way and stand up against men. Being females, and friends with the leader of Foxfire, you would think that these women would be a great fit for Foxfire? Well, because these females were black, the group denied entry. This scene completely went against the moral of the group, which is women independence. This was a very strong scene and Joyce Carol Oates really shows passion and emotion throughout the entire chapter. I would recommend this novel to any high school student, but must warn you that it is a difficult read. The phrases and writing techniques of Joyce Carol Oates are sometimes difficult to understand, but once you start getting into the novel than it will become a lot easier and the flow will come.

The gang, Foxfire, is founded by a group of girls who've all suffered alientation and lack of parental attention. The girls share a sense of being alienated and restricted from any sort of real social benefits or meaningful relationships becuase of their age, gender, economic status, and family situation. The gang is formed, and begins, by using public humilation and minor violence to bring justice to local men who have abused the privileges of their gender. Quickly, though, their activities escalate, and it becomes clear that the gang is on a path to self-destruction. This book was a bit hard to get into at first because its written in the tone and style of one of the gang's members, but the writing becomes engrossing. Oates truly takes on the tone and spirit of a teenage girl gang. While this is part of what makes the book hard to get into, it ultimately makes for an engrossing story. It is striking just how anti-male Foxfire's violence is, and the book seems to suggest that this is one of the myriad of social responses to a world in which girls are expendable objects, sexualized, and undervalued. Indeed, Oates invites the reader to consider the gang and it's activities as part of a continuum of responses that individuals in a depressed, sexist, and emotionally alienated society might produce. The book is as much a critique of the word that made Foxfire possible as it is a narration of the gang's activities. While Oates does not excuse the violence she clearly assigns broader culpability to the world in which these girls live."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27479235-laura", "userReview": "Foxfire was thought provoking, infuriating, interesting and eye opening. This book was very different from what I have ever read before and therefore I felt that I wasn't going to like it all. The book was narrated by a women called Maddy who was looking back on her journals she had kept when she was part of a girl gang called Foxfire. I found it relatively difficult for me to read the more violent scenes in the novel because I am very opposed to violence of any kind and generally speaking believe that violence is never the answer. However, the male characters and the woman that Legs meet at the institute were described and portrayed in such a way that they filled me with anger. I was surprised that the book was able to fill me with such strong emotions but I tend to root for the underdog in most stories and the way the adult treated the girls was so unfair that I couldn't not get emotional. I didn't mind the writing style that Foxfire was written and hardly noticed that there was very little punctuation. However, if you are a person who likes correctly formatted sentences and finds it hard to read run on sentences then this book may be a long read for you. I would recommend this book to people who don't mind violence and who are 13 or older. I don't think it is necessary to be a feminist to read this book because before I read this book I was indifferent towards feminism. However, now that I have read it I am a lot more concerned with equality because I am more informed about what was happening to women not that long ago. Overall, this novel was very thought provoking and really brought a lot of ideas about what is ethically right and when you should draw the line."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27479255-melissa", "userReview": "I found Foxfire to be a very thought provoking novel. I would not suggest this book to younger kids or to anyone who does not like violence. I am mature enough to handle this kind material although even for me I found the content to be more graphic then I expected. Although I believe that this is what the author intended. As the message she was trying to convey was of women empowerment and to show that the reader must understand why it was needed. That is why these girls had to deal with the traumatizing experiences that they did. Something that I realized though when I was reading it was that every male figure was portrayed badly. Though I know during that time period it was common for men to view women as objects and not as real people. However it seemed a bit harsh to portray every single person this way, as there were certainly some respectable men in that time. The novel seemed to be taking these moments and putting them to the extreme of the spectrum in order to make a big statement about sexism as well as make the girls look empowering instead of looking like criminals. Throughout the entire novel their actions could be justified. They were not always right but they were justified. Although I am not sure if I agree with their actions and the way she was showing female empowerment. I do not believe the way they beat up and harmed those who were abusing them was the right way to promote female empowerment. I think that in those cases yes the men were awful but by harming them the way they did they were stooping to their level, which makes them no better."}], "description": "Det \u00e4r 1950-talets USA.
