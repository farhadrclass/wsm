For more info on this challenge, click here. \ud83d\udc99 A couple years ago, I won a giveaway of the second book in this series, LADY IN RED, but I never read it because I am a trash person. It's not even that I lost the book: I can literally see it sitting right on my bookshelf across the room at this very moment. You see, I hadn't realized when I signed up for the giveaway that it was the 2nd book in the series, and that freaked me out a little. How could I read book 2 if I hadn't read book 1? What if there were...spoilers?Fast forward to late last year, when THE DARK LADY finally went on sale for Kindle. I say \"finally\" because I was literally stalking this book for years, waiting for the price to drop because I'm a cheapskate. If you're thinking to yourself, \"That seems excessive, waiting several years for a price drop of a few dollars,\" welcome to Nenialand, pal - where I can spend $5 on a cup of coffee but have trouble rationalizing the purchase of an ebook for $4.99.THE DARK LADY is a fun book and really tries to follow in the footsteps of its Gothic predecessors from the 60s and 70s, but with the edgy modern twist of sex, scandal, and drugs. I'm a huge fan of Gothic Romances but they were notoriously tame and scarcely escalated beyond kissing. It's a shame, because some of them - Victoria Holt, in particular - were very sensual about their passions, and you could totally tell that they wanted to write a dirty story but probably didn't feel as though they were allowed. Well, you needn't worry about that in THE DARK LADY. There are several rather steamy scenes at various points in this book, floating atop the murky sea of angst like bits of erotic driftwood. Mostly, though, the focus of the book is on the angst of the two leads: Ian and Eva.I don't want to say too much about these characters, but Ian is an ex-soldier who served in India and Eva was recently imprisoned in a Bedlam-style madhouse. Both of them carry the burden of dark secrets and the sense of responsibility for things that really weren't their fault. These experiences have warped them considerably, and impact their ability to relate to one another, even though they were close as children. This relationship-focused angle of the book, set amidst the backdrop of filial obligation and responsibility, smacked of yet another one of my favorite Gothic Romance authors: Marilyn Harris. Harris is quite a bit darker and depraved when it comes to fleshing out her characters, though, and even though Ian and Eva are cast in a darker mold than many other contemporary romance heroes and heroines, they still pale in the shadows of that truly glorious madness that is the Eden family, Marilyn Harris's main claim to fame, and one of my favorite yet-to-be-completed-by-me series.The atmosphere of this book is dark and lovely, with many wonderful passages. Sometimes the writing can be a bit plodding, but I liked it for the most part because it was in keeping with the Gothic style. Like others, I thought the matter of Eva's opium addiction was resolved too cleanly (as soon as it was no longer convenient for the plot, really), but that's par for the course with most issues in Romancelandia, sadly. If it's no longer convenient, it's no longer in the plot. Bye, and don't let the deus ex machina hit you on the way out! The whole thing with Mrs. Palmer also seemed anticlimactic. I wanted to find out about her history and what turned her into such a revenge-getting, torture-happy crazypants-wearing individual. But no. Maybe this is dealt with in later books.I guess I'll finally be checking out LADY IN RED now! 3 stars"}, {"userName": "WhiskeyintheJar/Kyraryker", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2763722-whiskeyinthejar-kyraryker", "userReview": "Recommended by Cherie3.4 starsThe first 5 chapters of this was dark, gothic, and vastly intriguing but as the story went on, it lost me.

The middle was greatly stretched out and the ending rushed as Eva's addiction wasn't dealt with and the asylum storyline left hanging for future books. There's something here to the author's writing, though.

This haunting tale of love lost and then slowly found again was a pleasure to get lost in. Lady Eva Carin suffered the greatest loss a mother can bear and while she was in the depths of her despair, her brother-in-law deems her insane and locks her in an asylum where her soul is drowned in laudanum and everything is dark, depressing and horrifying. Lord Ian Blake knows it is his duty to find Eva and bring her back to herself, after all, he is the one that watched her husband die, his best friend. Ian and Eva have been drawn to each other since children and when he arrives for her in the madhouse, Eva can hardly believe it. A daring escape is just the start of the new troubles that will follow Eva and Ian. Eva needs to recover, not just from her addiction to laudanum, but also to prove she is clear of mind to finally be free and she opens her heart to Ian. However, Ian has seen to many horrors to believe he can be good for her and struggles to deny his feelings and hope for a bright, new future together. Somehow this couple must push through the past and grasp what is waiting for them without losing each other in the process. . .Such a hauntingly, wonderful, tear inducing story! I was unsure how Eva was going to recover from her trauma enough to find love but her past with Ian is a strong foundation that could not be shaken and survived even through the darkest of hours. This story will grab you right from the beginning and it just keeps going with wonderful twists and drama. I would have liked to have seen a bit more in Eva's recovery...I felt it happened just a little bit too easily for what she must have endured. But, then again, her love and trust in Ian was strong enough to keep her going. There are a few loose threads that I would have liked to have been resolved but I am guessing that they continue into the next story so I am very anxious for that story...now. I usually say a book could be shorter, but this one could have been a bit longer and I would not have complained! The writing was lovely and lush and I liked watching Ian overcome his grief of his past through the flashbacks. Eva and Ian endured so much separately that you just knew that together they would be whole. Eva is a stong woman with a determination that really shined. I thought I had guessed the ending (well I was hoping anyways) and I loved the little twist as it had my heart racing to keep reading! If you are looking for something different away from the glitz of the ton, The Dark Lady is the romance for you as it delivers angst, depression, betrayal, and action as it leads up to a true love so strong, nothing will hold it back.

Her baby died in a carriage accident. Her creepy brother-in-law had her doped up and stuck in a nuthouse (where everybody got raped on a regular basis except the heroine because she had stretch marks and everyone knows rapists can't get it up in the presence of stretch marks) and told all of society her poor fragile mind had shattered and she was recuperating at a spa in Europe.Clearly, creepy brother-in-law is villainous scum.More villainous was the mistress of the nuthouse, who made quite a lot of money keeping these inconvenient women locked up and whoring them out and was none too pleased to have the heroine escape and seemed pretty damned determined to kill that slippery little bitch... until it was time to wrap things up and she just disappeared from the story. Not even \"and the evil mistress of the nuthouse absconded and could not be found by the authorities,\" just \"IMA DESTROY THAT BITCH AND EVERYTHING SHE HOLDS DEAR\" on page 237, and then never another word about her for the last 76 pages. Cuz, yanno, she was just on her period when she had all those mood swings, and then it was over and everything was chill. So they get the heroine legally declared sane so her creepy brother-in-law no longer has guardianship over her and can't stick her back in the nuthouse. They are able to have her declared sane because she has detoxed from her year of forced dope addiction and slowly, painfully come to terms with the death of her husband and son.But while that's healthy and all, it's not HAPPY ENOUGH FOR A ROMANCE NOVEL.So her creepy brother-in-law arranges a meeting, where he tells her HER SON WAS NEVER DEAD AT ALL! HE WAS JUST KIDDING! LOL!Because although he's an unconscionable bastard who arranged all this because he didn't want to lose the title (which came to him after his brother died) to his brother's son, he's not so unconscionable he'd drop a rock on that little fucker's head to make sure he was dead and never a threat to his position. (He is not familiar with the concept of \"double tap.\")AND FOR ONCE, HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH! HER SON IS ALIVE AND WELL AND HAS BEEN WELL CARED FOR BY LOVING PEASANTS ALL THIS TIME!So she gets her son back and all is beautiful and shiny in the world. Obligatory baby epilogue and The End. And to think, toward the beginning, I was thinking how refreshing it was to read something that (other than the \"stretch marks are boner death for rapists\" bullshit) didn't flinch from ugliness. I foolishly thought this might actually pull off \"the human spirit can triumph even under the most abhorrent circumstances.\"Nope. Handwave.

And then I read it. It caught my attention at first, but ultimately ended up a major disappointment. As the book opens, Lord Ian Blake has returned from India, obviously in pain and deeply burdened. The opening of the book has an almost gothic tinge to it as Ian approaches Carridan Hall in search of his beloved Eva, Lady Carin. With just a few short paragraphs, the author has shown us that Ian is miserable and guilty over the fact that his friend Hamilton was killed in India, that he seeks to make amends somehow to Hamilton's widow, and that he loves her. The mood is set, and in the beginning, the writing in this book is strong and compelling.Upon reaching Carridan, Ian learns that not only has Eva lost her husband, but that her son has died as well, and Eva herself is an inmate in an asylum. Ian goes to see her, and finds himself horrified at the conditions in which she is kept. Unkempt and heavily sedated with laudanum, Eva is far from the vivacious creature of Ian's memory. Ian immediately decides to rescue her from the asylum, and manages to spirit her away. And it is around this time that things start to fall apart.This is a partial review.

Yet, he is off in a huff when he fights with Eva. What does Eva do? Exactly the thing every addict would do...off to find the next fix. Awesome.A couple of pages later he does the same thing again.From the middle on the book fell apart. It felt rushed and not thought through.

I love that shit. :P However, the story for me fell apart somewhere around the middle of the book. The romance became flat and by the end I just felt like the dialog between h/h was cheesey.

Ian is haunted by feelings of guilt over his friend\u2019s death and harbors a terrible secret that makes him believe himself unworthy of Eva\u2019s love. Not only do they have to face their own personal demons but also the malignant forces that are determined to destroy them. I loved how Ian did everything to protect Eva and prove that she was sane.

For some reason it looks like women suffered even worse than in the earlier years. This is the case with our heroine. This woman, as the story opens, is in hell and she\u2019s hanging by a thread.Lady Eva Carin not only lost her husband, but soon after suffered a loss even greater than that, a loss of her son in an accident of her making. Thomas, her brother-in-law who is now the new Lord Carin, uses her pain and devastation to his advantage and commits her to an asylum in which for the past two years she\u2019s endured many \u2018disciplinary\u2019 treatments ordered by the woman who runs the place, such as a regular dose of opium to a point of addiction, many beatings and more.Lord Ian Blake is back from India and as much as he dreads coming face to face with Eva, he knows that he ows her the truth about Hamilton\u2019s death, and feel that this as his only opportunity of redeeming himself in her eyes and coming to terms with his role in it. He\u2019s been haunted with memories of not just Hamilton\u2019s death but also with their life as children as all three have grown up together in a wonderful home provided by Hamilton\u2019s father, Lord Carin. He took in both Eva and Ian after their individual parents died. As they grew together, boys were always vying for love and approval of the old man but it was Hamilton who started envying the bond that had developed between his father and Ian.Ian on the other hand hadn\u2019t realized that his earnest admiration and love for Lord Carin was a sore point to his best friend so whatever he did to please him, Hamilton viewed it as a challenge and affront to his own character. Even Eva was in some way touched by their rivalry. While they all were aware of her duty to marry Hamilton, they also realized that she had more in common with Ian than Hamilton, but neither Eva nor Ian voiced their thoughts or feelings out loud as that would be a breach of duty and bring much hurt to the man who they both loved like a father.Ian is shocked to find out that she\u2019s been committed, but once he enters the hell she\u2019s been living, he is livid and enraged.

However,\u00a0the Dark Lady\u00a0by M\u00e1ire Claremont, coming out February 5th 2013, is just that. A GREAT romance novel! The reason I'm not too fussed on romances is because to me, they seem to focus mostly on the sexual escapades of the characters rather than the rest of the storyline. In my opinion, they usually are bordering on erotica more than romance. I can usually guess what's going to happen and overall I just feel the plots draw on and on. The Dark Lady\u00a0by M\u00e1ire Claremont set in 1865 is definitely NOT one of these drab and predictable story lines! From chapter 1, I was drawn in to the dark, sorrowful, and horrific madhouse that Lady Eva Carin has been subjected to for two years! Thrown into what could only be described as the very pits of Hell by her brother-in-law, Thomas. Eva is beaten, molested, put under constant darkness and more. All under the watchful eye of Mrs. Palmer; the woman who runs the asylum. Ian Blake, Eva's late husband, Hamilton and herself, all grow up together in a wonderful estate in England. With Hamilton always trying to outdo the naturally more inclined Ian in everything from sports to winning Eva's affection (she was betrothed to Hamilton) and even the late Lord Carin's love.Throughout this entire book, I was trying to guess what was happening next and was delightfully surprised when I was wrong! Claremont kept me guessing and looking forward to the plot!\u00a0 =] The relationship that blossoms between the tortured souls of Ian and Eva is really quite beautiful! Each have unspeakable secrets. Each have something weighing them down. Drowning in guilt. Between the two, and some help from loved and trusted friends, the childhood loves begin to come into themselves. Into their own rights. I love the character progression. It was not dull nor drawn out. Instead, the skirmishes that took place were exciting and I held my breath, waiting to read who comes out as the victor! For a great love story, peppered with some action, addictions, a little betrayal, and just a dash of sex,\u00a0the Dark Lady\u00a0by M\u00e1ire Claremont is the book for you! I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely be recommending it to my friends! Claremont does not go with the \"norm\" on this one and because of that, I think\u00a0the Dark Lady\u00a0will be a great hit and simply fly off the shelves!

Our heroine, Eva, isn't mad, but after what she has endured, no one hesitates to believe her late husband's brother when he claims otherwise. Not only did her husband Hamilton die, but she lost their young son shortly afterwards. Evil brother-in-law had her committed to a madhouse, where she has been locked away for the past two years.The conditions Eva is forced to live with are subhuman. The women are drugged... abused... violated. And she would have stayed there to rot, if not for the return of her childhood friend, Ian.As children, Eva, Ian, and Hamilton were inseparable, the best of friends. The were all raised by Hamilton's father, who set up the betrothal of Eva and his son, before anyone was old enough to know their own hearts or minds. Ian was the golden boy, and Hamilton became increasingly jealous and bitter that his father seemed to prefer his cousin. The insidious feelings transformed Hamilton into a twisted man, which ultimately led to his own death.Ian has always loved Eva, so when he saves her, his heart can't help but beat for her. Yet he has so much guilt wrapped up in Hamilton's death (and about the fact he wasn't there to save Eva sooner) that it cripples his ability to give in to his feelings. Eva needs him, though, to help her beat her forced addictions... to elude her brother in law and the fiends hunting her from the asylum... and to prove her sanity.It was so angsty and dark. I really enjoyed the vast majority of the book. The conditions in the madhouse were absolutely chilling. And what was done Eva was heartbreaking. But in contrast, the tentative steps Eva and Ian take toward love and solace are so satisfying. Ian is so utterly devoted to saving Eva in every way, to keeping her safe forever. And she manages to find this inner strength, to rise above the horrors she has endured. Both are so damaged by the past. I got so wrapped up in reading it. It was very engaging.It wasn't perfect, though. The end of the book didn't fit for me... it didn't keep with the tone of all that came before it. It was just too happy and perfect after all we went through with these two. It took away something from the struggle they triumphed over (if that makes sense.)Overall, I did like the book.

Then the hidden horror of \"asylum,\" especially private institutions who destroy women who must be silenced, who are simply impairments to a climb up the power ladder. Here you also have a hero who is himself a broken man, one whose sense of honor has been damaged beyond all recall, or so he has come to believe. Again it is a social norm that accidents aren't supposed to happen, people aren't supposed to be killed because they have driven their victims to the brink of despair, that friends are responsible for one another no matter how unworthy one party may be. So it is that Lady Carin and Lord Ian Blakely muddle along, secretly loving one another, caught in a web of honor before justice, and suffering for entering a marriage with the wrong man because of misplaced loyalties. It's a tough novel to read in some ways, but it is bracing in its honesty and the kind of novel we all have to read from time to time that presents a far more realistic and balanced view of Victorian society as opposed to those stories who life up the beauty of a decadent lifestyle of the beautiful and wealthy. Thanks to this brave author for using her considerable writing skills to give us a really terrific read."}, {"userName": "Patr\u00edcia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149100-patr-cia", "userReview": "RATING: 2.5 stars.The exploration of Victorian conventions about madness and about asylums and the treatments for people who were not ill, but simply in grief or inconvenient, was interesting, but since this was a character based book, I didn't see that much development. There was much to be explored, from Eva's grief, stay at the asylum, addiction to drugs and her fight to get rid of it, to Ian's own tortuous thoughts. It was all resolved too quickly, painlessly (mostly through magic!sex) and while the characters were all \"woe\" and dark and tortured, it was only so because the author constantly reminded us of the fact; and because everyone was always having tortured thoughts. I didn't feel the grittiness, the darkness, the true pain of people who had suffered a lot.The villains motivations were not really explained (well, Lord Thomas's were, but he was a cardboard villain), which was a pity because I thought Mrs. Palmer seemed quite interesting (in a villainous way).The romance felt contrived and I must say I didn't care for the protagonists. Too Mary Sue and Gary Stu for my taste.Good first effort and points for competent writing and an interesting concept, but it needed a lot more development. Still, the other two books seem interesting and I did like Mary in this book."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3710658-barbara", "userReview": "Lord Ian Blake has returned from India with troubling demons and many regrets, feeling that he\u2019s responsible for his best friend\u2019s death. Now that\u2019s he\u2019s back in England, he needs to make sure his friend Hamilton\u2019s wife, Lady Eva Carin is safe and cared for. When he discovers that she has been locked in an asylum after an accident that resulted in the death of her young son, he embarks on a mission to save her. This story is aptly named, for it is a dark and twisted tale of the nastier side of Victorian society, where a woman could be locked up on the word of her guardian, never to be seen again. I enjoyed the main characters, with Eva struggling to overcome not only heartache and adversity, but addiction as well. Ian has struggles of his own with his guilt for not keeping his pledge to bring Hamilton home alive. The secondary characters of Ian\u2019s Aunt Elizabeth, his friend Lord Wyndham, and Eva\u2019s asylum roommate Mary were great additions to the story and the villain of the piece was suitably evil and deserving of his fate. I love discovering new authors and I\u2019ll be watching for the next fantastic story from Maire Claremont after reading this wonderfully dark and intense debut.(I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads.)"}, {"userName": "Aimee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1611860-aimee", "userReview": "Lord Ian Blake had gone to India to save his best friend, Hamilton, from himself. With Hamilton finally killed because of his cruelty, Ian returns home 2 years later to face his widow, Lady Eva Carin. He is shocked to learn of her infant son Adam's death and her subsequent commitment to an asylum by Hamilton's older brother, Thomas. Having loved Eva from afar for as long as he can remember, he determines to at least see her, and what he finds upon his arrival at the facility shocks him to the core. She has been living a nightmare, and before the night is over he rescues her from her captivity. However, it will take much more to save her from her own guilt and from the laudanum she had been sedated with. Eva isn't the only one who needs saving, as Ian is wracked by his own guilt over Hamilton's death. Is Eva truly mad? Can they save each other before Thomas's henchmen can find them and return her to the asylum? I enjoyed this book and plan to read the rest in the series. I literally didn't want to put it down from the very beginning and cheered for Eva and Ian the entire time. The end was a nice surprise."}, {"userName": "Cherie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13271610-cherie", "userReview": "I don't usually read \"dark\" romance. I read for entertainment and like to learn something at the same time. Therefore, since I never considered stopping reading this book I guess it's not as dark as others I've started and stopped reading.Someone else referred to this as a debut and if so it is very, very good for a debut. There was a tightness in my chest several times when Eva was in danger and Ian's devotion to Eva was palpable. I will read Mary's story when it comes out because she was an unforgettable early character. In addition, I loved Ian's aunt Elizabeth who injected sunshine just when the book needed it.There is a strong message about forgiveness in this story. Not the forgiveness of those who have trespassed against us, but forgiveness of ourselves for not living up to our own, usually unattainable, expectations.Since there was nothing at the end of the story about what happened to the warden of the asylum I'm thinking she continues to play a part in Mary's story. She vowed to make Eva pay for escaping and since she was not brought to justice in this story I'm thinking she's a player in the next."}, {"userName": "Wendy LaCapra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5141047-wendy-lacapra", "userReview": "Dark Lady grabbed me on page one and kept me riveted through the end. The writing is gorgeous, the heroine strong and very sympathetic, and the hero honorable and sigh-worthy through the darkest moments. The story is swims through the hidden side Victorian splendor, where laws could be twisted to satisify the ends of the powerful. As the hero and heroine clash against the forces bent on their destruction (and sometimes against each other), their strength and honor build and the very deep wounds of their past heal. Those clashes, whether or not they are in alleyways, carriages, madhouses or drawing rooms, are always vivid and soulfully depicted. Ian and Eve form a love that conquers her consuming grief, his pervasive guilt and the greed and evil intent of the villain(s!).Highly, highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Ariana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461177-ariana", "userReview": "3.5 I'm not sure exactly what to say about this book. I've wanted to read it for a long time and now that I have I'm not sure what to think. It was very well written. I loved the story. But I had a hard time with the hero and heroine, although I did feel the strong connection they had for each other. Ian was such a martyr throughout the whole book. Even the things that I liked about him were just overshadowed by his constant pity party. Yes he had his reasons, but after a while it become enough. Eva, I like a bit more. She went through so much, I mean so much, but she was still willing to begin again. She was an extremely strong character and I liked how she wasn't going to let anyone drag her back down after her hard fought battles.

My own fault, really, because I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting into, but the language was just too melodramatically gothic for my taste (YMMV). I liked the idea of the plot, and the descriptions are first-rate, but the language just made me roll my eyes. Also, a seemingly minor quibble-- unless by some miracle both the Carin and Blake families have family names that match their titles, the author completely ignores proper form of address from the get-go (e.g., Ian Blake, Marquess of X, gets referred to as \"Lord Blake\" and not \"Lord X\" as he should be). As I said, it's a little thing, but it's pretty basic, which doesn't bode well for the author's overall attention to historical detail."}, {"userName": "Diane K.
