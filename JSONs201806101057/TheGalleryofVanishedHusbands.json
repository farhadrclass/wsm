It addresses a serious issue: What happens to a Jewish woman when her husband disappears and she's unable to get a religious divorce. She's in limbo, a married woman without a husband with no chance to remarry again until he's found alive and is willing to give her the divorce. (If he's found dead, she can be declared a widow.) Until then, she is an aguna. It's incredibly painful and disturbing to read how powerless Juliet Montague is after her husband leaves without a trace of his whereabouts. Juliet's parents eventually hire a private detective and what happens afterward is heartbreaking. It's also painful to see that Juliet is the subject of pity and gossip within her community. It's clear that Juliet doesn't want her parents' traditional life. She stops keeping kosher and no longer observes the Sabbath. I get the impression that she sees these things as backward, ancient, dull. Which in a thousand ways breaks my heart. She much prefers the exciting world of art. Juliet becomes entwined with artists and ends up running a galley. Art plays an important, key role in this novel, which I loved because I too appreciate art. The descriptions of the artists and their work completely captivated me. I could have understood Juliet's frustration over her faith because of becoming an aguna. But that wasn't my perception at all as to why she was turning away from Judaism. She wasn't interested in remarrying (though it may very well be because it wasn't an option. But if it were an option, I'm not sure she would have), she seemed to eventually accept her fate, and she did find a way to enjoy life with her artist boyfriend and friends. Overall, I didn't feel her angst over her life and situation. Yes, she was embarrassed. Yes, she was hurt. But she seemed more frustrated over the fact that her good-for-nothing husband stole her painting. If anything, she felt sad for the pain her husband's absence caused her children. But she too, caused her children pain, by often putting her love for art before them.As a story, I was fascinated and gripped by the tale. It's well written and the characters' voices are strong. As someone who deeply loves her faith, this story broke my heart. I felt so sad for the horrible position Juliet found herself in. The author's husband's grandmother was an aguna and was the inspiration for the novel. The real woman, Rosie, seemed to be quite strong. She ended up owning a popular hair salon and raising her two children alone. Beyond admirable. One observation about this novel disturbed me. I felt that it perpetuated a negative stereotype of observant Jews that doesn't exist for me and certainly not in a lot of communities I know. Was this the author's perception of how things were in the late 1940s and 50s? Was it authentic? I guess that depends on each individual. But I can't relate to it and for that I am deeply grateful. For me, being Jewish and observant is something I absolutely love and cherish. I think fans of Naomi Ragen's books will like this one.Thank you so much to Penguin (Plume Books) for providing a review copy."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13427823-maureen", "userReview": "Juliet is a woman who rebels against the Jewish community that she was born into. Left to bring up two children on her own when her feckless husband leaves for work as usual one morning but never returns, she becomes involved in the London art society of the 1950's/60's. She was labelled an agunah ( a woman chained to a marriage after the husband disappears, and yet is not divorced). She is shunned by her community because of her lifestyle, something that brings shame on her family, but not Juliet, who wilfully maintains the lifestyle that she loves,even having a long term affair with one of her artist friends, something that would have been against her state of agunah.For me the story plodded along nicely, but wasn't riveting. I found it hard to relate to Juliet, finding her too self absorbed,and therefore could find no empathy with her."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10672516-deb", "userReview": "I did not enjoy this book for many reasons. It was not terribly written but it lacked passion and atmosphere. I felt that my eyes were having to climb across each page with great effort.It begins in the 1960s but there is no real feel of the sixties conveyed. We are introduced to Juliet who is saving up for a fridge and her children who want a TV but really that seems to be the authors only attempt to demonstrate that the story is not set in the present. It could be set in the 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s. There is nothing in the writing to evoke the sixties. An odd comment is thrown in to the story occasionally to remind the reader of the decade, but even that felt forced.The characters are passionless. I understand that they are meant to appear respectable and conservative because of their Jewish upbringing but for a woman who lives for art; a creative passion, and rebels against her family and has a love affair, I found it all quite simply boring. There was no intensity, excitement or passion shown at all.The vanished husband is a tiny part of the story that was tied up in a bow on the last few pages and felt quite flat.The editing towards the end of the book is not great and you get the feeling that even the writer and editor were bored by that point and hurrying up to get it over with.When I read a book, I love the after feeling where you are free to wonder what happened to the characters. I love the individuality of it, the way the reader can create their own future for everyone. The end of this book is full of short chapters to summarise the lives of all characters so that you are not even left with the opportunity to use your imagination after you finish reading.It took me over a month to read this. Each time I read a few pages I had to stop. I don't recommend it. I found it boring, unmemorable and slow.My review half way through:I'm really struggling with this book and I'm finding that I am skim reading which is never a good sign for me as I love to take in and digest every word.The writing seems to jump as if edited poorly. Scenes are separated either by a huge jump in a paragraph; a page break; a decorative fern (I do not know if this has a technical name) or the end of a chapter. All of these would generally be acceptable but it seems like each was chosen randomly and the inconsistency feels like carelessness."}, {"userName": "Melanie Coombes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2148960-melanie-coombes", "userReview": "The book takes place in 1960s London. Juliet Montague is a mother of two who lives in a very conservative Jewish community. Her husband disappeared one day and since then, Juliet has felt she has also become invisible to those around her. Only men can divorce their Jewish wives at that time, so Juliet is unable to marry again and lives a sort of half life until she comes across a young artist who paints her portrait. This becomes just one a series of portraits of Juliet painted throughout her lifetime. Juliet, eventually enters the art world of London as a gallery owner. She also begins a lifelong love affair with a reclusive artist. But until she finds her long lost husband, she is unable to fully life her life or feel that she belongs. Although this book was slow paced, it was wonderfully written. As Juliet is on an emotional journey, I felt her yearning for more in life and attempting to break free of her confining conservative homelife.  I loved that each chapter is titled with the name of a portrait done of Juliet and the year it was painted. That chapter dealt with that period in Juliet's life. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it."}, {"userName": "Maggie Anton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1280353-maggie-anton", "userReview": "Sorry, but you can get the plot in another review; this is my opinion. The story was compelling enough to keep me reading to the end, but I didn't connect with most of the characters - and especially the main character. The disconnect was almost immediate when I saw that the heroine's name was Juliet Montague but nobody ever made a joke, or even mentioned, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. I never understood what she was feeling or why she made the decisions she did. Indeed, I found some of the secondary characters better fleshed out. The descriptions of the 1950's Orthodox world and modern art culture, and how they clashed, were excellent. I certainly got a good feel for the time and place."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/170420-laura", "userReview": "Not sure the cover art does the book any favors - this is a book mostly about a woman rebelling against her traditional community in favor of art. Juliet is one of those people who sees things: blues are really blue, ugly stands out, and if you show her a bare wall she can tell you what art you should put there. One of the defining moments of her life came when she was young and an artist painted her portrait in exchange for her father repairing his glasses.She's also in an impossible situation: her husband disappeared (taking that portrait with him). For most of us, we could get a divorce based on desertion. Juliet, however, lives in an orthodox Jewish community and she can't get a religious divorce, so she's a \"living widow\" with certain restrictions on her life. This is London in the 1950s and 60s, and Juliet's rebellion (leaving her father's glasses factory to found an art gallery, consorting with men without a chaperone) may seem tame but in her world? Huge.The problem for me was that the book mutes both the art aspect and the rebellion aspect, instead settling for a muddy middle ground that looks at Juliet's life from 1958 through 2006. We get to know her family (parents and children), her artists, her search for her husband (or, more accurately, the portrait he took) and other parts of her life but it's not as vivid as it could have been.ARC provided by publisher."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane", "userReview": "The year was 1958, and Juliet Montague was turning thirty. She'd planned to be sensible, to go out and bring home the new refrigerator that she had been saving hard to buy. But Juliet had always had an eye for art, and on the way to the shops she spotted a young artist, Charlie, at work. She asked to buy the painting; he wouldn't sell it, but he offered to paint Juliet instead. A much better present!It wasn't the first time that Juliet's portrait was painted. The first time had been when she was just nine years-old. But her husband had taken that portrait - and one or two other things of value - when he abandoned Juliet and their two children.And, because Juliet came from a strict Jewish community, that made her an `aguna' - a woman who is still a wife, and will always be a wife, unless her husband can be traced and persuaded to grant a divorce.But Juliet's second portrait heralded the start of a new life. She was pulled into the circle of a group of young artists, ready to open a new gallery to showcase their work, and eager for Juliet, whose instinctive understanding of art they greatly appreciated, to run it for them. It was a whole new world, and Juliet loved it.But Juliet's traditional, conventional, parents don't understand. They are good people, they love their daughter, and they have the means to help support her and their grandchildren, but they fear for their daughter.She moves between her two worlds - belonging and yet not belonging in each of them - and knowing, but not quite admitting, that she can't be at peace until she learns her husband's story.Natasha Solomons writes beautifully, with a wonderfully light touch, and she catches people, places, emotions, quite beautifully. I appreciated that she shared a great deal of understanding of the Jewish community, and Juliet's position, without in any way making this a book about issues. It's a book about Juliet's life, her relationships, and her emotional journey.I particularly liked the way that the impact of the family situation on Juliet's son and daughter was illuminated at different points of the story. And the way it was shown that times, relationships, everything changes.But I was disappointed that other characters were barely illuminated at all. There was so much potential in the many of the artists that crossed Juliet's path, and so I was disappointed that there were intriguing hints, particularly of things that had happened in the past, but no more than that.The structure is interesting: each section begins with the catalogue number and title of a different portrait of Juliet, and spins a story around that time of her life. That made things a little episodic, but it was only a problem at the end of the book, when the story jumped forward quite a few years.Those things, the slight fuzziness that they give the story, make me inclined to say that this isn't as good a book as The Novel in the Viola - which I loved - but it is very readable, and emotionally engaging. I appreciated that it was a very different story, set in a different world and at a different time.The Gallery of Lost Husbands is a quiet story, a story of a life being lived. There are no big dramas, but the important moments, when something happened or when realisation dawned, were captured beautifully. You could say that it's a very grown-up light read ..."}, {"userName": "P.D.R.

I really like the writing style and tone which Natasha Solomons uses. She has a way of making words dance.This story is about a very conventionally raised Jewish wife who breaks free and becomes a much respected Gallery owner in the art world of the 1960s. That sounds like a predictable plot. No way!On Juliet Montague's thirtieth birthday she sets off to buy a 'fridge, something she has painfully saved up for. Her husband walked out one day and never returned, she has struggled to raise her two children and is smothered in the very Jewish proper 'village' society. Instead of that much needed 'fridge Juliet sees a young artist and although he won't sell her the portrait she admires he does offer to paint hers. Juliet says yes, bang goes the 'fridge, but thus begins her emergence from suburban nonentity to respected art adviser and gallery owner.Note the name, Juliet Montague. Solomons has a lovely dry wit which reveals itself in the names, and the situations she puts her characters in. She gently laughs at her characters, their worlds andbeliefs. It's a kinder version of 'Lord, what fools these mortals be.' and makes for one of those reads where the reader is given much to think about and a gentle laugh at humanity.A great read for anyone who likes to think and ponder with an author whose sense of humour is gentle and unobtrusive, and whose writing style is impeccable."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18817920-megan", "userReview": "This was very disappointing in the end.

Juliet is a mother and wife although her husband has now vanished and has left her in an uncertain position and surrounded by her tightly knit Jewish community. I felt incredibly sorry for Juliet, she is trying to get through a difficult time with people talking behind her back as she tries to raise and protect her children and yet not lose herself amongst everything that is happening. Reading the book I felt almost claustrophobic sometimes , Juliet was stuck in a place in her life where she could not move on and you often feel her helplessness. During all this she finds solace in an unexpected place and this would give her comfort and joy throughout her life .Juliet's act of rebellion was a shining moment in the book where we really see Juliet the woman, her guts and gumption , and this made her a terrific heroine and very inspiring.

The beginning is quirky and I had high hopes of it but the rest of the book to me didn't live up to its initial promise. Juliet's husband has disappeared. Because of this she is something of an outcast in her Jewish community.Going out to buy herself a birthday present, she intends to buy a fridge, she is diverted by a young artist selling his wares on the street and decides to commission a portrait of herself instead of spending the money on a fridge. This sudden extravagance leads her into a world of art and artists and a new career. Not an artist herself, she recognises a good picture when she sees one.Somehow what happened to Juliet left me cold after about the first third of the book and I found I really didn't care about her life any more and it was a real struggle to finish the book. Yes it is well written and the beginning grabbed my attention but I just lost interest in Juliet and her life and ceased to care about it.

This action opens up a new life for her and her two children.The story covers an era and situations I know absolutely nothing about: the 60s London art scene and what it's like to be a Jewish woman whose husband has disappeared. Now I know a tiny bit more. Because Juliet's husband left her, never to be seen again, within her community she is an 'agunah': Jewish law states that unless a husband gives his wife an official bill of divorce, she remains married to him forever, she is literally 'chained' to her marriage unless her husband can be found.

The title is great and the use of portrait titles and the artist for each chapter is ingenious. We follow the life of Juliet and the painting of her portrait by each of the painters throughout the book. Each section represents a different period in her life. We are shown how Juliet is tortured between being a good jewish widow and being herself. She wants to please her mother, but at the same time yearns to break free from the old traditions. When she tries to track down her missing husband, she finds that he committed bigamy. This changes her whole outlook. The book is more about Juliet finding herself.

She finds herself in the art world of 1960s London and as the years progress she has her portrait painted by scores of artists.

She understands that he is gone for good, and grieves more for a portrait of her as a child which he has taken with him than she does for George himself. She seems resigned to making the best of things, bringing up her children alone and working in her father's business. However, it's not quite that simple. Juliet is part of a close-knit Jewish community, and the rabbi explains to her that until George can be found and persuaded to grant her a divorce, she must be considered an aguna - a living widow. Her parents are desperate to track down George so that Juliet can remarry and, as they see it, become respectable again, but their friends and neighbours treat Juliet with pity as well as suspicion.At the start of the novel, Juliet has saved up enough money to buy a refrigerator. But then, she stops to look at some paintings displayed on park railings and on impulse decides to buy one. The artist, Charlie, offers to paint her portrait instead of the painting she has selected, and so begins a whole new life for Juliet. It's the start of a new career for her; she opens a gallery in London selling the work of Charlie and his friends, which eventually becomes highly successful; she becomes the subject of portraits by many other artists. She begins a relationship with one of the artists, which lasts for many years. Her children make it through adolescence and have their own successes and failures along the way. Through all of this, Juliet negotiates her way through two very different worlds, never quite belonging in either. In many ways, she is quiet and unremarkable; she doesn't try to stand out, she dresses conservatively, she is polite. And yet, the Jewish matrons know that she is not quite one of them; there is something about her that doesn't fit in. Meanwhile, as her (all male) artist friends are fully engaging with the sexual revolution, Juliet conducts her affair with artist Max with great discretion. She never tries to shock, but neither does she compromise. As a character, I found she quietly got under my skin, as did the book itself. The chapters are each given the catalogue entry of a painting, a portrait of Juliet, and each chapter then elaborates on the circumstances of that particular painting to tell her story. I particularly liked this device; it introduces many of the minor characters and moves the story along nicely. Most of the novel takes place in the ten years or so following George's disappearance, but there is a big jump at the end to 2006, when the missing painting is returned to Juliet and we finally hear George's voice through a letter. I found this part of the story a bit frustrating; George himself has his own story and reasons for disappearing which could create some sympathy for him, and yet - despite the letter he writes to Juliet to explain himself - he is fundamentally selfish and never apologises for his actions. The resolution is all about the painting which Juliet has missed so much, and not about George himself. It is a charming, well-told story and I enjoyed it a lot. The middle-class, suburban Jewish community is skilfully described without ever feeling like caricature. And Juliet is a well-rounded and likeable character, quietly stubborn and determined. I did find some parts of the story a little hard to believe, particularly the idea that with absolutely no background in art Juliet had an innate sense of what looks right, and especially what would sell, and was able to make such a success of her gallery in what is a very tough and competitive world. However, the warmth of the story shines through and makes it a 'feel-good' novel. I will look out for other books by Natasha Solomons."}, {"userName": "Viviane Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682057-viviane-crystal", "userReview": "Juliet Montague is living in England during 1958, a time when change is slow to happen, especially for a woman like Juliet who thinks artistically, \u201cout of the box,\u201d but who lives in a conservative Orthodox Jewish community. Her husband has abandoned her and her two children, Frieda and Leonard. But she isn\u2019t free to divorce him as only Jewish men can divorce women and not the other way around. So she more often than not elicits pity and gossip from her mother\u2019s friends and acquaintances and her children are taunted by other children who hear their parents\u2019 gossip about their missing father. It\u2019s not a happy place to live yet Juliet chooses to focus elsewhere. Her remarkable gift is \u201cseeing\u201d what makes a beautiful, successful painting or sketch in spite of the fact that she\u2019s never been to art school or studied art. She will be the key to fame for sharing this gift and will realize a new freedom in the daunting but exciting process!Juliet\u2019s grandparents came to America not because they loved each other but because of circumstances amazingly described in these pages; but they have learned to build their lives around traditional Jewish living, a focus that Juliet lacks and which they and her parents are frustrated. They just don\u2019t understand why Juliet is not satisfied with living as a \u201cwidow\u201d in a sense, an opinion that will later stun Juliet when she learns the truth about her marital status years later.After Juliet meets the artist Charlie who paints a gorgeous portrait of her, he and his friends know a treasure when they meet it and talk her into directing a gallery show of their most recent works. Up to now Juliet has grown to hate her job in the family business, so this opportunity she grabs, again to the consternation of her family. Now she works daily with these budding artists who are changing with the times and expressing a \u201cnew\u201d way of seeing life, be it in objects, landscapes, portraits, or abstract expression. The novel continues with Juliet having a love affair with an older \u201cwar artist\u201d and describes how her children react in different ways. One reverts to the family\u2019s Jewish traditional way of life and the other develops a passion for art, one his mother fails to nurture in some ways and elicits indirectly. But nothing is set in stone and they too will evolve in unexpected ways that the reader will get totally caught up in.To say more would be to spoil a grand story, a trip to America and back to England, the turmoil and evolution of her children\u2019s lives, and Juliet\u2019s coming to terms with who she really is and how grateful she is to grab life as it comes at her, regardless of other people\u2019s opinions and standards.The Gallery of Vanished Husbands: A Novel is about living with passion amid the vicissitudes that life throws during the journey. It\u2019s about truly \u201cseeing\u201d beautiful art, the meaning of tradition that comforts and doesn\u2019t imprison, and more and more and more! Well-crafted, full of humor and pathos, realistic yet transcendent, and more \u2013 this novel is highly recommended and a literate delight to relish and experience!!!"}], "description": "A stunning new novel from the New York Times bestselling author of The House at TynefordLondon, 1958.
