About 500 of those featureTrez and Selena. They fall in love. It\u2019s very romantic. I sometimes have a hard time with Ward heroines but I liked Selena a lot. I liked her in the previous book too. She is a chosen, but she is fierce and sexy and likes adventure andadreline. But she is also sick, with a rare disorder that attacks some of the chosen. It\u2019s been fatal in the past, eventually locking up their bones until they die.This goes on for 500 pages \u2013 Trez and her living each day to the fullest, allowing Selena to experience things and do everything romantic, while everyone else scrabbles for a cure.Except then she dies.The heroine of the book, dies. Like dies \u2013 and then they burn her body. There is no Jane ghost floating around. There is no miracle like Mary received. She didn\u2019t get sexual healing like No\u2019One/Autumn. She is just plain dead.This is a romance book, right????The golden rule of a romance book is \u2013 there is a happily ever after at the end for the main couple. Even a \u201chappy for now\u201d will work. But you see you need that \u201chappy\u201d part. And don\u2019t tell me Trez gazing into the night sky is happy. Trez is now in deep mourning over the death of his bonded one. So\u2026how is this happy? I don\u2019t give a crap that iAm has someone, his romance barely had the page time Trez and Selena\u2019s did. His romance was wayyyy in the background and kind of forced and insta-lust if you ask me. He was not the main character of this book. Trez and Selena were \u2013 and she dies.Sorry JR Ward. I don\u2019t care. This is NOT a romance book. I\u2019m sorry if your characters \u201cmade\u201d you do thisBut, as I said, I\u2019m stuck doing what I\u2019m told- so last summer, when Trez and Selena\u2019s outlining process froze early on me, I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it.I don\u2019t care if you didn\u2019t choose this. Because you could have chosen to write it a different way.I don\u2019t \u201cchoose\u201d things. I don\u2019t get to pick who ends up with whom, or what happens. I appreciate from the outside how it must appear, that the author is some how \u201cin control,\u201d but that is simply not my experience.I didn\u2019t want Selena to die. I can assure folks that the LAST thing I wanted to do was spend four months writing a book that put me right back into the head space I\u2019d been in losing Jonah. Some of the scenes in THE SHADOWS made me cry so hard, I couldn\u2019t see the dayum computer screen. I hated editing it. I hated copyedits. I hated galleys.(https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog...)I would never want to tell a writer how to write a book. The author and their book have such an intimate relationship. BUT \u2013 I\u2019m going to say, don\u2019t kill the hero or the heroine. You don\u2019t get that choice. You want to kill off Selena? Don\u2019t let him bond with her, kill her off in chapter one, and then let Trez fall in love somehow with his actual mate. We let that slide with Wellsie. We didn\u2019t have a Tohr and Wellsie book, so we could just let that slide. But this? Nope. You don\u2019t give us 600 pages of romance, just to kill the heroine. Nope.When we read a romance book, sometimes we are really tested. Horrible things have happened to countless heroes and heroines. Sometimes like Selena, they are fighting a horrible physical disease, sometimes they are abused, sometimes they have to endure tragic things. And the romance reader is sobbing or angry right along with them \u2013 but we have trust that the author will give his or her characters a happy ever after by the end of the book. Put us through hell \u2013 make us cry, make us rant, make us angry \u2013 but make us believe at the end of true love. You broke that trust.This isn\u2019t the end of the world \u2013 I realize this is a book and not real life. But enough crap happens in our real lives \u2013 I want a happy ever after damn it. And The Shadows does not have one.

Just saying!First read 2015Reread April 16 2017 Sometimes, the evil you fought wasn\u2019t anything you could hit or shoot or dismember. Sometimes you couldn\u2019t even hurt it. And that was really fucking awful.There truly is a very thin line between love and hate and this book tap danced all over the borderline. I took hours after finishing this book trying to decide what to rate this book. What do I rate a book that I both love and hate? One that made me laugh, smile, cry, scream and broke my heart all in one go. A book that kept me on edge even after I already read enough spoilers to know what was coming and still couldn't put it down. I rate that a 5 star read!\"Abruptly, Trez stopped breathing as he put the math together and came up with the impossible. Holy shit, that was the\u2014 \u201cHello, Mother,\u201d Vishous said dryly. \u2014Scribe Virgin. \u201cI have come for a purpose.\u201d The female voice was hard as crystal and just as clear. \u201cAnd it must be served.\u201d \u201cReally.\u201d V took a drag on his hand rolled. \u201cYou gonna take candy from a baby? Or is it kick a puppy night?\u201d\"\n\u201cCourage doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t scared.\u201d He dropped his mouth to hers and kissed her. \u201cGod, I love you so much. I love you so deeply. I love you forever.\u201d-TrezI can't say I am shocked that J.R. Ward killed off Selena even before I read all the spoilers. I mean she killed off Darius and a pregnant Wellsie. Zsadist is a former blood slave that was raped, beat and imprisoned for years, Bella got kidnapped, beat, and tortured, John Matthew got raped, and Xhex got kidnapped and raped repeatedly by Lash. So no I am not surprised that J. R. Ward went dark. I would have been shocked if she didn't do something dark. That being said If you are looking for rainbows, flowers and everyone gets a HEA don't read this book. There is no HEA for Trez and Selena. There is a HEA for Iam and Maichen.\u201cYou\u2019re going to find someone else,\u201d she moaned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fall in love with someone else and she\u2019s going to be able to give you young and hold you when you have daymares and make you dinner.\u201d The tears came so hard and heavy, she couldn\u2019t take a breath. \u201cAnd she\u2019s going to be better than me because she\u2019s going to\u2026\u201d Selena collapsed against him. \u201c\u2026she\u2019s going to be lucky enough to be alive.\u201d-Selena\n\u201cIn all the time they\u2019d known the guy, iAm had never paid any particular attention to the females. Or the males. Personally, Rhage had always thought the poor bastard was suffering from Phury Syndrome a condition whereupon one brother was so fucked-up that the other fell into a black hole trying to save him.\u201d As anyone who reads the BDB knows there are lots of side stories going on in each book, almost like a on going soap opera. Xcor and Layla's story is one I have been dying for since The King. When I first read of Xcor I hated him, then I soften to him, and then I loved him. So I was so looking forward to the bits and pieces I would get in this book about Layla and Xcor and for the most part I loved what I got. Till the end when Xcor pulled a douche move that made me wanna stomp his nuts. I mean Really Xcor? You are going to decide you can't be with Lalya and fuck a hooker? WTF??????????????She is . . . the moon in my night sky. And that is the beginning, middle, and end of it. There is no more to be told than that, and never shall I speak of her again.\"-Xcor about Lalya\nThen Manny said, \u201cThere is nothing I won\u2019t do to keep her with him. Nothing.\u201d Now Rhage was the one pulling the pivot. \u201cThat\u2019s what I needed to hear, Doc.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t put your faith in miracles, Hollywood. That\u2019s a dangerous bet.\u201d \u201cIt happened for me and Mary. When we needed one, we got one.\u201d Manny stared out the front windshield\u2014and didn\u2019t appear to see anything of the darkened street ahead. \u201cI\u2019m not God. And neither is Doc Jane.\u201dNow because Xcor and Layla are not really together but have just been talking I don't really count it as cheating but I still don't like when heroes are with o/w regardless. So Xcor is going to have to really work hard to redeem himself in his book, whenever it comes out. (Soon Please J.R. Ward Please!!!) I enjoyed getting to know Paradise and meeting Craeg in this book. They are going to get their own book in a spin off series. Blood Kiss I already like them. Especially Paradise who has a sassy side and is wanting to break out of the traditional roles of women and be more than a breeder. Woot girl power!\u201cFuck you. I\u2019m more than just a pair of ovaries you can put a ring on.\u201d-Paradise\n\u201cHey! Dragon boy Project Runway\u2019s on if you wanna come watch. Maybe pick up some pointers on your threads.\u201d Rhage\u2019s stare narrowed, but he refused to look at the angel. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a Saved by the Bell marathon you have to go watch?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t hate on Zack. He\u2019s like your little fucking brother, beauty queen.\u201d -Lassiter Assail I don't really care about. Loved getting to see Mary and Rhage again. It really pulled on my heartstrings that Rhage was having such a hard time with Trez and Selena and how it reminded him of almost losing Mary. I know The Beast is coming out and I can't wait to get more of yummy Rhage. I will tell you who I really want to see more of, beside Xcor and Lalya of course because they are on top of my list and that is Qhuinn's brother Luchas. I need to see him get a HEA badly. OMG I want some more Luchas!! My poor Qhuinn. I think J.R. Ward is a extremely talented writer and I love The BDB series. This book wrung my heart out. My heart broke for Trez and Selena, but I seen a sad beauty to the time they had together. I hate that she dies and that Trez is left mourning, but like with A Walk to Remember and The Notebook there is a sweetness to their love story. I think I will always be a huge J.R. Ward fan and I can't wait til the next book in this series. Below I leave a few quotes that moved me the most.\u201cHey, on the outside chance the Grim Reaper is listening, I think he needs to know how much we hate his ass. Come on, my queen, say it with me. \u2018Fuck you, death.\u2019\u201d She put her free hand up to hide an off-kilter smile. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know\u2014and stop ducking this. \u2018Fuck you, death!\u2019\u201d When she just mumbled the words, he shook his head. \u201cNope. Louder. \u2018Fuck you, death!\u2019\u201d Selena started to laugh. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d He smiled and nodded at her, still poised with the ring at the top of her finger. \u201cAll together\u2014like he can hear you.\u201d \u201cFuck you, death!\u201d she hollered. Then she smiled broadly. \u201cFuck you, death!\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m happy about saying these things, thinking these things! I have God only knows how many nights left and I\u2019ve wasted this one sitting on that fucking chair right there staring at some bullshit book I haven\u2019t been reading, imagining you hanging yourself in a bathroom after I die! Or getting drunk and running your car into a tree! Or going on another fucking spree that lasts not a decade but a century!\u201d She circled a finger next to her head. \u201cThese thoughts\u2014I don\u2019t want them! You think I want to tell you this? Jesus Christ, Trez, I love you! I don\u2019t want you to ever be with another female, like ever! I want you to sit in a corner and mourn me until you die\u2014I don\u2019t want you to see the sun or the moon, or enjoy another meal, or have a good day\u2019s sleep! I want to haunt you for the rest of your life, until everywhere you go and anyone you talk to, all you can see is the ghost of me\u2014because then I know you won\u2019t forget me!\u201d\u201cThis is real,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou can trust this. You aren\u2019t going to wake up and have this be over. You and I? This is our beginning.\u201d \u201cI love you,\u201d she said in a rough voice. \u201cI want no one else but you.\u201d iAm smiled and pushed in between her legs, bringing his body against hers. \u201cAnd I feel the same way, my maichen. I love you, I love you \u2026 I love you\u2026\u201d"}, {"userName": "Katie Michaels", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669344-katie-michaels", "userReview": "If you have managed to make it this far without any spoilers on this book, I congratulate you. There is a reason people are talking about it. Even in the broadest strokes, it's impossible for me not to convey that things go really wrong here. That doesn't mean everyone hated The Shadows. To the contrary, it's got its fair share of 5 star reviews floating around. You'll find readers who love rolling around in the kind of misery only \"true love\" can precipitate. You'll find others who find beauty in despair. And there are still others who feel like JR Ward could rub dog shit around on a piece of white paper and call it art. I fall into none of those categories.To explain how this book is a failure for me, I am going to have to tell you why. I'm not going to spoil every single thing about it, but I am going to talk about the big twist at the end that has split the reading community. Here is your last chance to look away.JR Ward kills the heroine. She is still dead when the book is over and she is not coming back to life. They burned her corpse and sent her off into the Fade. It's the forever kind of dead. And for that, I say JR Ward has broken her covenant with readers. Romance books are supposed to end with a working relationship between the hero and heroine. There is supposed to be happiness there. One isn't supposed to be dead while the other is left a shadow of himself. No pun intended there. I'm too mad.I've actually seen other people claim that these books aren't romance; that they are more urban fantasy. To that, I call bullshit. Yes, Ward has broadened the scope of the series to multiple POVs (too many) but each book follows a core romance. Remember how much it sucked when she killed Wellsie? And she was a secondary character. This is so much worse, and honestly, has about a quarter of the emotional impact. I didn't cry. I wasn't even tempted to cry. I was too annoyed. The move was so very wrong that it pulled me out of the story entirely, just wondering WTF? Meanwhile, we've got iAm percolating a very second-string romance with a ridiculously predictable outcome, and that is supposed to be satisfying? IT'S NOT.I can't even blame the ending as the only problem in the book. Rhage is prominently featured here, which some readers may be excited about. But I swear, he acts like he is losing his marbles. This plot thread recurs over and over and then it is totally dropped with no explanation. It made the character look like he had a personality disorder and then it had no impact on the plot. (And don't get me started on his self-love in the pantry.) We also get a Scribe Virgin sighting; then she is dropped like a hot potato.The romance, itself, between Trez and Selena (before Ward killed her) was kind of meh. I had some issues with how she got so modern so fast. But my real complaint was in the melodrama. It didn't ring true. Maybe that's another reason why my emotions weren't engaged.The most interesting parts for me were in the few cut-scenes with Qhuinn's brother, Luchas. He is a messed up guy and with good reason. --And in the b-plot of Xcor and Layla. I feel something there. I liked where it was going, until he stomped all over it with a hooker.In the end of it all, I was just left tired... and disappointed. This is not what I signed up for as I committed myself to these 576 pages. After wading through all of the predictable, trite, and even downright ridiculous parts of the book, I should have had something to show for it. A happy freaking ending. Instead, I got a big, fat fail.If you want total spoilers from beginning to end: http://twitter.com/tweetasiread*ARC provided by publisher"}, {"userName": "Kellie Maddox-Ward", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7309666-kellie-maddox-ward", "userReview": "[Q: So what\u2019s the next book?A: The Shadows\u2026.and its about Trez and iAm\u2026but, even better, guess who\u2019s coming home???? MURHDER!!!!Q: What\u2019s going on with Selena?? What\u2019s wrong with her joints???A: She has a disease of the Chosen.Q: Can they fix it?? What\u2019s the disease???A: Why would you read the book if I told you about it? (It\u2019s genetic, but you\u2019ll find out more in the book!Q: The Queen of the Shadows is pregnant. Who\u2019s the father:A: The father is S\u2019exQ: Are Rhage and Mary going to have a baby?A: I know the answer but\u2026Keep reading!!! Can\u2019t say but wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it came soon!Q: What\u2019s going on with the Scribe Virgin?A: She needs some to re-engage her. It would be a surprise if she just came back to only to date Des\u2026(laughter..nudge, nudge Desmond Hall\u2026)Q: Will JM ever know he\u2019s Darius.A: No, it would de-stabilize the world. I get asked that a lot. But I don\u2019t think so\u2026Q: I think I\u2019m the only one that cares, but\u2026are you going to write a novella about the sympaths in that little camp?A: Oh, no the sympaths are going to be trouble in the future.Q: When\u2019s my boy (John Matthew) going to become a Brother?A: The timeline is a funny thing\u2026it\u2019s hard to show things that happen at the same time. The timelines get wonky sometimes. Tohr\u2019s book was an entire year. Some books only take lkike..ten days. I think there needs to be something extraordinary that happens to get more Brothers in\u2026that\u2019s what she said\u2026Q: Also\u2026prequels for all Brothers (AND FRITZ!!!)A: That might be a good idea!Q: Is Boo bonded to iAm???A: (and JR does a selfie of the crowd before answering\u2026) Absolutely. One of my favorite lines in the books was, \u201cGoddamn cat\u201d. And Fritz saying, we don\u2019t have seafood in this house. And I know where you\u2019re going with this\u2026no, iAm is NOT banging the cat\u2026geez\u2026The reason the next book is called The Shadows is because iAm gets his too. iAm gets banged. (Lots of inappropriate comments related to cats\u2026er\u2026edited for good taste lol)Q: Is the Lassiter part of the FA world.A: Lassister was awesome was he not? He\u2019s firmly in the BDB world. Q: Last year you said boo was not exactly a cat. What is he exactly.A: You\u2019ll find out\u2026maybeQ: Is Immortal the last FA book.A: Yes. There is something after but what we might find is how the FA and BDB intersect.Q: When you were here last year, you told us a little secret about Tohr and Xcor\u2026A: I did? What did I say? (That they\u2019re brothers\u2026) I did??? I forgot that\u2026. (laughter from crowd at JR\u2019s forgetting she\u2019d spilled those beans\u2026) That will be coming out soon. The way Xcor and Layla\u2019s situation is maturing, that\u2019ll come to a head (Q: What is it?) I know,, but I\u2019m not telling. But yes, Muhrder is coming back in the next book.Q: Is Michael from The Story of Son going to come into the BDB world?A: I could see how but it wouldn\u2019t be any time soon.Q: What about Saxton? Does he have an HEA?A: Yes, you\u2019ve met him. And no, it\u2019s not iAm. iAm ends up with a chick, and Saxton ends up with a guy. Q: Does Lash come back. A: Yes\u2026and he gets a girlfriend\u2026and it\u2019s Devina. (room goes crazy)Q: Will you go back and do snippets for each Brother.A: I was just talking to my editor about wanting to do more slices of life. The series needs to move or it dies. But it is something I\u2019d like to do, to show small pieces of the Brothers\u2019 lives. Q: Will we see more of Qhuinn\u2019s brother Lucas? What\u2019s the deal with him. A: We will see more of him. Yes, he will get better, but he has a long road. Q: She wanted to know, if Wrath were to die, would Butch be the next in line?A: Yes, Butch would be the next in line under the old ways. But that\u2019s not the way we do it anymore.Q: Why did they notify V about Payne\u2019s fighting Wrath, rather than Manny?A: I would say it\u2019s like someone from a foreign country. Manny is not from this context, so, it was V who would take it harder and take it personally, as an insult. Q: Where are the Hos\u2026er\u2026Chosen????A: The Chosen are fluctuating between the Great Camp and the Sanctuary. (Why??) Because they can.(laughter) There are number of areas that are floating out there: The Chosen are one, the future of the training program is another. In the next few books, I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll find out.Q: What is Assail?A: He is one hot motherfucker. (Hoots.) He\u2019s a drug dealer. He\u2019s a full-fledged vampire. Q: Xcor and Throe, will there be a knockdown, drag out, fight between them?A: When I met Throe, I thought he was such a good guy, but the more I get to know him\u2026I think he has some bad juju. He\u2019s beginning to make my skin crawl. At the end of the King, Xcor was softening. But Throe is ramping up.Q: Is there a reason the Bloodletter doesn\u2019t have a bloodline written?A: It\u2019s because they\u2019re all such assholes\u2026Well, okay, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. The coffins in the garage, Boo\u2026there\u2019s always a reason, I just don\u2019t know what it is. Q: So, you have Qhuinn and Blay\u2026will they do the traditional ceremony and get each other\u2019s names on their backs. A: Or Qhuinn has had Blay\u2026but I think they will, its just not important to them.Q: About JM\u2026how will Wrath give him his scar, since he\u2019s blind. A: It will work out. JM will definitely have one.Q: Will Lucas end up with Abalone\u2019s daughter?A: I don\u2019t know. I know Abalone will hook up with someone, I just don\u2019t know who. Q: Have we met iAm\u2019s woman?A: You have not. Q: Payne was so depleted at the end of Lover Unleashed.A: She probably has to go to the Other side to replenish. She\u2019s like a get-out-of-jail free card, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me that she eventually has to stop.Q: Is anything going to happen to Havers, cause I wanted to chuck the hell out of him. A: I wanted to throw my computer after that scene when he treated Layla like a vessel. One of the criticisms of the series is that its misogynistic, but I think it's changed and grown.Q: My girl Xhex\u2026will we see more of her?A: I love her. Remember when she rejects JM, and he comes out of the bathroom stall? I love her and would to see more of her, and to see her fight. (How is she going to handle Murhder coming back.) She\u2019s not but JM might skin him. Q: Is Autumn Throe\u2019s sister?A: No, but his sister is the lynchpin around which two of your favorite characters spin.Q: Will we see of Rehvenge and Ehlena?A: I would love you to see more of Rehvenge and Ehlena. Q: Is wrath 6\u20196\u201d or 6\u201d9\u201dA: He\u2019s 6\u20199\u201d and I\u2019m dyslexic. (Laughter)Q: Will there be a movie?A: I write books not screen plays. If the right deal came along, I would consider it. But my job is to write the books. When you\u2019re lucky like I am, you have to work and focus and do what makes you people like these books. I\u2019m a writer, I\u2019m not very interesting. So, I have to keep my focus on what keeps you liking the books. Q: Are we going to hear from the glymera?A: Yes, but they\u2019ve really had their cock and balls cut, but they really have great ideas (eyerolls) and I\u2019m looking forward to see what they are.Q: Why didn\u2019t we see that scene between Wrath and Tohr, at the pool house?A: I know as a writer it\u2019s my job to write but that scene was too personal which I know sounds weird, but I really think that sometimes there are things I can\u2019t show\u2026Q: What\u2019s the difference between the S\u2019hibe(Sp?) the Moors, and the Shadows?A: The S\u2019hibe, the moors and the Shadows are all the same. Its different traditions referring to the same people. Q: Will the fact that Xcor carved up the lesser have anything to do with Jose and Butch crossing paths again. A: Jose and Butch will have closure. So, the one thing that hasn\u2019t happened in the new world is that humans haven\u2019t figured out that vampires exist. There\u2019s a trajectory there that will tie it all together. Q: Will Manny become a vampire?A: Manny will never be turned. Payne can keep him young and perma-preserve him, and keep him alive. And the risk of turning is too high. Q: Can you tell us about Lassiter? Will he fall in love?A: He will fall in love. We will find out his purpose. It\u2019s in the last scene in Immortal. Q: I was like hoping that Lassiter would end up with the SV so V had to call him \u201cDaddy\u201dA: (Laughter) That would almost be worth it. Q: Is Wrath\u2019s eyes from inbreeding or because of the poison when his mother was pregnant?A: I don\u2019t have an answer. The inbreeding makes sense. But I can\u2019t say for sure. When I saw his mother get poisoned, that made sense, too, and I wondered. But Little Wrath doesn\u2019t have that. It\u2019s ironic that Beth being half-breed is what threatened his throne, but is what strengthened the gene pool. (Can Payne heal him) I\u2019ve never seen Payne anywhere near his eyes, so I don\u2019t think so.Q: Are you going to tie in the Lessers and the FA series?A: The Creator in the FA series is the Father of the SV and the Omega.Q: What happens if the mansion gets raided?A: The mhis covers the mountain but isn\u2019t as thick at the bottom, and that\u2019s one of the questions I\u2019ve had. And, I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. Q: How did you come up with the barbs on the male sympaths?A: I didn\u2019t think that shit up! That\u2019s just what happened. That\u2019s what he has in his pants! (Were you drunk?) I don\u2019t drink\u2026aren\u2019t you glad? Maybe medication would be a good idea. (Laughter)Q: Will see more of the O\u2019Banyon brothers?A: I would love to, but it\u2019s whether I can carve out time for those.Q: I loved the scene when Wrath\u2019s mother comes to him in the dream. Will he ever get a glimpse of Little Wrath?A: That was one of my favorite scenes. It was really cool, but really weird. I thought it was so great when he saw his mother. I was wondering if he was going to be preoccupied by whether his offspring would have the eye problems, but that wasn\u2019t the issue at all. I think it would be wonderful for him to see Little Wrath, but I thought there would be an emotional issue if Little Wrath had his eyesight. And he was okay with it, he was all, I\u2019m fine, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important to him. Q: Does Lassiter end up with a male or a female? And if it\u2019s a male is it Saxton. A: No, Lassiter likes girls. Q:Assail is selling drugs to the enemy and contributing to the lessers. Does that make him the BDB enemy?A: It\u2019s a difficult situation. He sees it as using the Lessening society for his own purposes. But if shit goes down, he\u2019s screwed. Q: Can Xcor get his face fixed?A: He absolutely can. He feels like, I\u2019m ugly, and I don\u2019t give a fuck. So I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s his priority.Q: Do the BDB & FA intersect?A: Yes! The Creator in the FA series the Father of the SV and the Omega.Q: What about the twins?A: I love the twins. I went somewhere very bad. I LOVED Sola\u2019s grandmother. Are you familiar with ghost peppers? Have you seen those Youtube videos about assholes who thinks it\u2019s a great idea to eat them? And their faces go red? One of my favorite scenes is when the twins start eating these things and they have no reaction. And that\u2019s Vovo\u2019s first clue that there\u2019s something weird there. Yeah, I think they\u2019ll have HEAs\u2026but NO! Not the same one!Q: How far do you see the series extending?A: The series is open-ended so as long as you want to read and the Brothers\u2019 speak to me, I\u2019ll keep writing!Q: Will we ever find out the relationship between Rehvenge and the Shadows.A: Yes, absolutely. Q: Will Lassiter save Eddie. A: No! (Does Eddies saved?) You\u2019re going to have to read the book!Q: Has Layla had her baby yet?A: You\u2019ll have to read the next book!Q: I love that you wrote a respected, kick ass character who is blind, since my twin and I are blind. And I just wanted to tell you how much I loved the scene where Wrath tells the foremen that \u201cI\u2019m blind and it\u2019s okay.\u201d A: I love that scene. It was one of my favorites for two reasons: so few people knew he was blind. That\u2019s why the cover, without his shades, was so significant.

But I heard about the drama with JRW's newest BDB book and decided to take a look. To my surprise, among all the angry/disappointed and some still bizarrely positive reviews, there was a post from her. She knew she had fucked up so badly, she literally made a post to justify her book on the release day.Let that sink in.Now, this is not a review of The Shadows, since I haven't and won't read it, but a comment about her post and series in general. Why? Because I can and because what I read truly horrified me as a reader and former JRW fan. These are some of the lines that stuck out the most to me, and a clear example of why everyone should avoid her books.\n\"the idea of doing another Chosen falling in love (...) was a total snooze to me.\"\nSo... She's bored of her own storylines\u2026? Okay.\n\"I assumed that iAm would find his love, and Trez would find his cure for his female, and then yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, classic HEA sh*t all over the place!!!! Yawn. NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE MY HEAs. It's just that felt so predictable.\"\nYou mean predictable like all your other HEAs? Boring? Yawn inducting? Yeah, I couldn't agree more.\n\"One of the issues with the Chosen is that (...) there isn't a lot of personality to them. \"\nWhose fault do you think it is that these characters have no personality and are boring to write or read about? I'm sorry, what did you say? Oh yeah, the author\u2019s fault. Shocking.\n\"I suck at writing women\"\nShe doesn't even bother to try and hide this anymore, I\u2019m literally ???????? Not only is JRW racist and sexist, she's a bad writer. She lives off her writing and she can't write female characters? After 12 books writing M/F romance, she still can't write women?? It sounds like she didn\u2019t even try, like she doesn't see where's the matter in saying she sucks at writing women, which says more than enough in itself. It just baffles me and honestly, I don't want to read a female author who has no idea how to write women. What does that say about her? Nothing good, that's what. No wonder her gay men didn't use lube to have anal sex and one adopted \"the girl\" role in their relationship since JRW couldn't think outside of her heteronormativity box even if it hit her in the face. And don't get me started on her description of (the few) POC characters in her books. She literally compared someone to A TABLE. (\"His skin was the color of the mansion\u2019s mahogany dining room table\") A fucking inanimate object. That's dehumanizing and offensive in so many ways, I don't understand how no one from her team of ass kissers didn't\u2013 oh right.Not only does JRW have no idea how to write female characters, she's created one of the most sexist universes I've ever read. Women are owned by their husbands and treated like possessions and the males who are decent human beings to their women are considered swooning worthy because they could be total dicks to their wives but chose not to??????????? The only female character who ever questions this is constantly described as manly and butch. Not just that, but she\u2019s just like any other male character, only with (small) tits. Because for JRW, female characters don\u2019t have any kind of personality unless it resembles a man\u2019s. Let's remember Cormia being grateful because \"Butch is old fashioned but he never complained about me working.\" Let\u2019s remember male characters asking other male characters to allow their women to do what they wanted to, because apparently women can\u2019t decide on their own. Let's remember the brothers literally being called an \u201canachronistic group of misogynists\u201d in Lover Reborn. Let\u2019s remember the only gay couple having a female third wheel added permanently to their HEA because JRW wanted them to be daddies~ and apparently the only way to form a family is if you have children with someone from the opposite sex. And let\u2019s remember the \u201cneeding\u201d and \u201cservicing\u201d bullcrap. JRW created an universe where women are unable to control their bodies or make decisions on their own and that\u2019s supposed to be romantic. Lovely, isn't it? I've always wanted some dub-con in my life.JRW's straight white cis privileges show in her writing as she insists on appropriating POC\u2019s culture to write her white characters but hey, like JRW apparently said to the accusations of racism, that's not racist because they are not human, they are vampires!!!!!!! ((SPOILERS FOR THE SHADOWS)) How dumb can you be to write a paranormal romance and kill the main female character?????????????? My friend told me JRW did it to be controversial and have an edge. Well, I hope the edge hits her little toe someday. If you use your writing as a cathartic exercise to cleanse your soul and that's the reason why you kill your HEA in a romance novel, THEN YOU QUITE LITERALLY LEFT ALL YOUR SHIT ON YOUR READERS.< sarcasm > ...... But ohhhh myyyy god, you don't understand, the man-pain made Trez so much more interesting!!!!!!! Thanks to Whatevers-her-name dying, his character could develop so much!!!!!!!!! Angst makes male characters so much better!!!!!!! And that's not sexist at all!!!!!!!!! < / sarcasm >Edit: I just found out Layla is in this book. I see reviews complaining about her obsession with getting laid while one of her sisters is dying. And because she kept lying to Qhuinn. It sounds in character for Layla, though. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Apparently she also helps Qhuinn when he's having issues with his brother?? Of-fucking-course. After all, Qhuinn/Layla was the boring, predictable HEA she had planned from the start. You know you've fucked up when my 2 stars review of Lover Reborn and my 1 star review of Lover At Last started to get likes again in the last few days.Lastly, whoever\u2019s still reading her books: Please love yourself more. \u2665"}, {"userName": "Lucy Qhuay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115693-lucy-qhuay", "userReview": "[ ---2014--- Another book in this awesome seriesJ.

Want me to get all nostalgic? Make me read some J.R. Ward and that's it. I'll always going to have a soft spot for her and these series.That being said I really really enjoyed this book. I mean, it was a very heavy reading and I was way too invested in the story, so for me it was actually quite difficult to read and finish.And maybe I'm growing old but I wasn't that happy with the multiple POVs this time and I kinda missed the old days when there were only three or four POVs. It wasn't all bad because I loved almost all the characters.Yep, you know who I didn't like? Assail.Remember I used to like Assail? Well, I don't know what the heck was wrong with me at the time. He's an despicable man, a drug addict who does nothing good nor interesting. Now I know that I only liked him when Sola and her grandmother were involved. I'm pathetic, I know.So, let's go to the MCs.I've always liked iAm better than Trez. iAm was kinder and sweeter than Trez but, boy, didn't he win me over at the end. You gotta love a man who loves so much and so hard.The whole situation with Selena was absolutely sad and I felt hopeless most of the time. I just couldn't see any way out.I just, man, I still don't know. I usually take my time with these books because it's a lot to handle.I don't know how things are going to work out for Layla and Xcor.On that note, I really don't like all the hate Layla always gets. I mean, what's up with that? How could people hate on her? What has she done? And I mean before the thing with Xcor because she's getting all that hate way before that.What? Because she fucked with Qhuinn? Oh, get over yourselves. She wanted and baby he wanted a baby and she was in her needing period. Done. Layla has been nothing but kindess and support without asking for anything. She was the first Chosen we knew and she was a window of oportunities. She was good with Rhage and Mary, she's been always there for all the Brothers so maybe I'm taking it a bit too personal but what the fuck?Anyhow, Trez and Selena... they were really good together. I liked Selena enough and that ending. I swear, I almost lose my shit and Trez was so heartbroken, gods, awful.This book was way too painful.iAm and the maid were really cute. One of my favorite couples, I think. Although their relationship felt rushed at times, they got to know each other better and that was great to see. iAm, lord...And Rhage? JFC, I didn't know how much I missed him until I read his POV. I missed him a lot and I'm so fucking happy we're getting another book about him and Mary next year!!I also liked Parry and Craeg. I'm looking forward to reading Blood Kiss this December.I'm counting on Zsadist's book to be the next one after Rhage's because I need some of my Hellren and Bella and Nalla!"}, {"userName": "Beanbag Love", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2598237-beanbag-love", "userReview": "[the sob-inducing death scene and its aftermath (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3125133-amy", "userReview": "What a heavy, depressing, disjointed and disappointing book.

This is going to be a difficult review, I don't want to give anything away about the outcome.....Trez and Selena:I've been intrigued by the Shadows since Rhev's book Lover Avenged. I didn't think that the WARDen could pull off Trez being worthy of a Chosen because of his manwhoring ways, he came off as..... I don't know...not callus because he was always respectful to the women he used but still, I couldn't see him with Selena. Now I can't imagine him with anyone else, and I now see him as one of the most honorable men in the series. Now for Selena, that Chosen certainly surprised the heck out of me!!!! I didn't expect her to be so vibrant, so fearless, so inspiring, so sexual!! Her enthusiasm for life is off the charts!! She's a fighter, she fought for the man who held her heart and won!! I was totally unprepared and shattered by their story.\niAm and Maichen:iAm is kind of brother you would love to have, he is fiercely loyal and protective. He would do anything for Trez. He was there as always at Trez' side knowing the threat of losing Trez to the S'Hisbe. Then when things are intense for him (like really intense) he meets Maichen and it looks as though he has finally, finally found someone. The attraction was unexpected but it seemed doomed from the beginning, Maichen has secrets but feels if she reveals them, she may lose him too soon.\ns'Ex, \"The Executioner\":s'Ex has a pretty big roll in this book as the s'Hisbe leader of the Queen's army and head executioner. He is ruthless, and seems to be unfeeling and sworn to his Queen. However; we see a new side to him, and I came to care about him.\nXcor and Layla:We get a couple of revelations regarding Layla's pregnancy and her relationship with Xcor...Layla is so conflicted, I feel for her...I don't know how much longer she can continue with her deceptions to the King, the Brotherhood, and Qhuinn & Blay. Her and Xcor feel deeply for one another and should be together but how? Xcor is responsible for the attempted assisanation and dethroning of (my) Wrath...I don't see good things coming.\n\u201cShe is....the moon in my night sky\u201d. And that is the beginning, middle, and end of it. There is no more to be told than that, and never shall I speak of her again. - Xcor to the BoB on LaylaNow really, who would have thought that such beautiful words can come out of Xcor's mouth!? There was some changes within the Band of Bastards, we'll have to see how this will play out....\nRhage, Mary, and The Brotherhood:Rhage was very front & center in this book, I have a feeling on where this storyline will be going in the future but I'll keep those thoughts to myself and keep my fingers crossed that I'm right. The \u201coriginal\u201d brothers are all part of this book and it was awesome to have them back, not to mention the bantering...loved it!!\n\n\u201cRhage cleared his throat. \u201cMy lord and ruler, Wrath, son of Wrath, blooded father of Wrath, I present you with Throe, Piece of Shit\u201d\n\n\nQhuinn's brother Luchas is still recovering after his rescue from the Lessers, but he has given up on his battered body & soul.

Was I mistaken or did he appear and it was a snippet so small that I missed it? Either way, I loved it but at the same time I hated how some storylines played out, I have to believe that the WARDen knows what she's doing. 4/05/15 Update (Q&A in Cincinnati yesterday)!!!!:I knew I read that Murhder would be in this book!!!!"}, {"userName": "P ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25327841-p", "userReview": "[when Trez keeps telling Selena that he loves her repeatedly (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Laura the Highland Hussy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2043222-laura-the-highland-hussy", "userReview": "Read this review on Got Fiction? book blogOriginal Review:*heavy sigh*No.I have to get my thoughts together on this one, but no. No more. I'm done with this.Full Review:*********SPOILERS ALL AROUND*********Wow. Where to begin. So I'm not sure how many of you are aware of the spoiler that JR Ward posted, but I'm grateful she did. I decided not to buy this book after reading it. But after a few days online and seeing the reactions, I figured I owed it to you guys to write an informed review of why I didn't want to read it. And perhaps it would have surprised me? I decided to put my money where my mouth is.Many many of my friends were torn on this book. Some whose taste is so similar to mine, loved it! Others, felt betrayed.I felt betrayed.But I knew this from reading A) reviews B) JR Ward\u2019s spoiler. Words from the author\u2019s own mouth are what decided this for me. I knew I wouldn\u2019t like it, I knew how it would end...and yet...I still had hope.Ward's spoiler link hereFor example, if I see cheating...I know it\u2019s a hard line for me. I won\u2019t like it. I know my taste. I know whose reviews I can trust to have similar issues. So when I see that heroine dies, but isn\u2019t saved miraculously, I\u2019m out. I'm supposed to read almost 600 pages and NOT get a happy ending? Are you serious? We joked on twitter comparing this to a Nicholas Sparks novel, but the reality is that with Sparks, you know what you\u2019re getting into, he doesn't call his books romance, AND HE DIDN\u2019T SPEND 13 BOOKS SETTING UP HEAs IN A WORLD WE\u2019VE COME TO LOVE.That is the worst part of all of this; I feel lied to. You don't spend years building up a Paranormal Romance series, and base, and fans galore, just to slap them in the face. She broke my trust.As an author, I will tell you, part of the plotting of a Romance novel is that you try your hardest to find some insurmountable defining Black Moment, and you make your characters overcome it. They win, they endure, they survive the trials we authors throw at them. They don't get an easy happy ending, they have to earn it.As a reader, you pick up a romance novel knowing that you have a hero and a heroine who by the end, will not only have fallen in love, but they'll have earned that love. They will deserve every happiness they've worked for. Could you imagine picking up a Mystery novel and...never finding out whodunnit? Of course not!In Romancelandia, you have either a Happily Ever After (HEA), or a Happily For Now (HFN). This is the Golden Rule in Romance. They overcome remarkable odds and they win at the end. Someone actually said \u201cNot all books have to have a happy ending...\u201d well, yeah, in Romances, they kinda do. It\u2019s the point of reading a Romance novel, rather than say, a Literary Fiction, or Urban Fantasy. And I\u2019ve seen people mention that the WARDen is leaning towards UF, but I call shenanigans. She\u2019s going back to her roots with The Bourbon Kings and the Black Dagger Legacy books Blood Kiss. She obviously knew her fans want more romance, or she wouldn\u2019t be going back to it.And this book wasn\u2019t UF. It was a Romance with no HEA.I\u2019m done with the Brothers, which is a shame since they were my first introduction to vampires post-Twilight. I\u2019m done with Ward, because I don\u2019t trust she won\u2019t do this again to us.Her comment about how she grieved for her dog through this book...then write this, let it be cathartic, then put it away. Write the book with a HEA, and then release the other part as a bonus 6 months down the road. It\u2019s a win all around! And I dno\u2019t think anyone would be mad, because they\u2019d have gotten the HEA. KMM did it with the The Dark Highlander by putting most of her first draft in Into the Dreaming, it made a lot of money, and we all had the other version so we were happy.I haven\u2019t even touched on the minor romance where iAm gets his HEA. Maybe maybe if this had been iAm\u2019s book where his romance was forefront, and 500+ pages were dedicated to him, rather than Trez and Selena, I\u2019d be more okay. But his romance is so secondary and so minimal, that it definitely doesn\u2019t take the sting from the betrayal. If anything, I think it makes it worse.Next up is Rhage and Mary. Again. DON\u2019T MESS WITH THEIR HEA, WARD! Why return to them, and give them some contrived issue about his prior promiscuity? Why not move on to Saxton? Or Layla and Xcor? (which btw, WTF, Ward, was that even necessary?).So, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m out. The End. I won\u2019t be returning to the BDB, I won\u2019t be reading Ward\u2019s spin-off, or her new Contemporary series, even as she cries Romance! I have romance again! I can\u2019t. It\u2019s not even a matter of principals, it\u2019s that, as I said, she broke my trust, and I won\u2019t go back for seconds. TL;DRThis reads like the previous BDB books, but the heroine dies at the end. I won't read Ward again, she's broken my trust as a reader, and pissed me off."}, {"userName": "Auntee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886675-auntee", "userReview": "[\n\n (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Alisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12256655-alisa", "userReview": "Britney is not the only one not feeling it. I can not believe how boring this book was. I was as bored as a stone statue (oh yes I did go there). I'm not even going to write a comprehensive review.

(There will be spoilers in my rants so stop right now if you don't want to know stuff)1. I loathe these Chosen chicks. Like really a lot. I think the series has gone down hill since they started being mates. What happened to the strong heroines from the begining of the series? I want more Bellas, Marys and Beths. I'll even take bad assed warrior females like Xhex and Paine. These milk toast Chosen just have to go.This is a quote from Ward's own blog post about the Chosen:Fast forward a couple of years and a couple more stories, and it was funny, the idea of doing another Chosen falling in love- considering that I'd already done Phury and Cormia- was a total snooze to me. One of the issues with the Chosen is that, as they have been emerging from their cult-like upbringing, there isn't a lot of personality to them. What on earth? If even you know how boring they are WHY ARE YOU WRITING THE THIRD DARN BOOK ABOUT THEM??(and that's not even counting the endless Layla drama)2. WTF on Assail? He and his story took up half of Qhuinn and Blay's book. Seriously....100's of pages. Why? Why take away from their story? What was the flipping point if were going to spend the next two books with only a few glimpses of him doing cocaine? 3. What the heck happened to Layla? I disliked her immensely the first few books she was in but then she stepped up during Qhuinn's book and showed some back bone. I thought I was going to end up liking her but apparently not. She was ridiculousy stupid in this book. There were a bunch of scenes in this book where I wanted to throat punch her but the one that really made me mad was when she gets so upset seeing Xcor jack off that she trips and falls hard enough to break her arm. Really? You were SO traumatized over a guy holding his penis that you endanger your child/children? How I am supposed to buy in to this nonsense? She didn't get pregnant through immaculate conception. She spent two days letting Qhuinn screw her brains out. I would think she could handle a little jacking off. Stupid. Just stupid. All her whining and sneaking around and playing dumb games with Xcor makes me want throttle her. 4. The Band of Brothers. Still hate them all. Don't know why we have to have all these scenes with them where absolutely nothing happens. Don't understand why they still speak Old World English. That's a petty complain I know but it's just so stupid to me. They buy clothes, eat out, go to stores, rent houses etc. How can they not know current English? If the Brothers can learn urban slang and speak it to the point you want to beat them then the BOB should be able to speak normally. And on that note... enough with the urban slang. It's ok with V cuz that's always been him but now everyone talks that way. Even Manny and Lassiter. Enough with that. Stop it!5. iAm got a shit side story. It could have been good if he would have actually had some time for his story to be told. As it was is was a snooze fest insta love. And let's talk about their first sex scene. I know they were both virgins but couldn't we have gotten more than them kissing and then him pushing his boy part into her girl part? Wow, how romantic. And how they both had fabulous orgasms from that I do not know.6. The heroine dies. Really? First of all that's just a bunch of bullshit. You don't kill the heroine in a love story. But I have to be honest and admit I didn't care. That was my biggest problem. I just did not care. How is that possible? I ugly cried in some of the first books. No telling how many Kleenex I went through in Z's book. We know Ward can write emotions like no other yet this storyline was so damn boring that I didn't cry. I didn't get teary-eyed. Nothing. 7. I'm over all the multiple story lines. It's too much. They're out of control. Too much going on and as a result no one actually gets the time devoted to their stories that they should. 8. Paradise is boring. I don't care if she goes to the training or not. In fact I don't want to see her again. Another 20 something year old virgin in a book. Yay...we've never seen that before (*gigantic eye roll*) Craeg seemed like he might be interesting but..... Most importantly I don't want to start another series just to get back to the way BDB used to be. How about Ward stop writing all these storylines and go back to one, two things a book? There's plenty of characters who could have a book about them. I refuse to start a new series and pay another $12 for the author to fix the mess that this has turned in to. The absolute only things I liked in this book were some of the moments between Rhev and Trez and then Trez and iAm. Some of those were touching. There is a REALLY good chance that this the end of my relationship w/Ward and the Brothers. I am definitely not reading the new series and I just don't know about this one. I think I'm done."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "So, this is my review of the latest Ward book. I love this time of year, and the traditions that come alone with it as a long-time JR Ward fan. It's a big part of why I enjoy this series so much.Sorry, but this is a really long review. I had a lot to say!\nPossible Spoiler Disclaimer:\n I will warn readers that while I really tried not to use overt spoilers, you will see that there is an emotional shock that comes in this book, but I don\u2019t reveal exactly what it was. Readers beware!The Shadows is the telling of the story of the two s\u2019Hisbe brothers who have become unofficial members of the Brotherhood\u2019s growing family. Trez is running away from his destiny, written in the stars, as the future mate of the Princess of the s\u2019Hisbe. He\u2019s done everything he could to disqualify himself, but the time is growing short and he can run no longer. iAm has stood in the gap for his brother for many years, trying to keep his brother from going over the edge of oblivion to the exclusion of having his own life. But the time is coming when he won\u2019t be able to save his brother. Trez is stone cold in love with the Chosen, Selena, but for many reasons, a happy ending doesn\u2019t seem to be written in their destinies. Will iAm ever get the chance to build his own life, and to make decisions that aren\u2019t dictated by his sacrificial love for his brother?With a storyline that like, you know there\u2019s going to be major drama. Drama is JR Ward\u2019s calling card. When I read one of her books, I automatically expect it. It\u2019s hard, at the same time, waiting for the other shoe to drop, and it often does, very hard. I deliberately took my time reading this, preparing myself for the emotional blows sure to come. Not at all sure that there would be a happy end by the last page. I know a lot of people weren\u2019t happy with this book, and I was prepared that I might not be, or that I might like it and find myself an outlier in saying why I liked it. So, it was emotionally stressful for me to read it. Another reason to take my time.Some have argued that Ward has moved away from her initial writing of romance. I\u2019m not sure I agree. Even in her earlier book, there was always a sense that not everything was settled, and while there were committed and happily mated couples, troubles could be lurking around the corner. Yes, the books were shorter and they focused more on the romance, but there was always something more, and plenty of drama. As the series has progress, the books have expanded, and with them, the storylines. And yes, the drama quotient. At times, it\u2019s wearying how the storylines get dragged out and she introduces yet another set of new characters instead of giving more resolution on current storylines. This book was not different in that regard. And there were parts of this book that ripped my guts out and gave me a headache that was just a shade below a migraine. I wanted to slap one particular character super-duper silly. And I wanted to shake another one. I wanted to rail at the capriciousness of life, and ask the whys. But at the same time, I was satisfied at the end of the story. Hence my rating.My opinion won\u2019t be popular on this book amongst many of my friends. Largely, I really enjoyed this book. While there were some parts that were terribly sad and that made me sob like a big old baby, I felt that JR Ward delivered the quality of storytelling I appreciate about her writing. I\u2019m not the one to tell you if she messed up specific details. I love this books a lot, but I don\u2019t always remember which hand of Vishous glows or which eye of Qhuinn\u2019s is blue versus green. To me, I don\u2019t find that terribly important. I do care about the stories and the emotional journey. I don\u2019t care if she rewrites some aspects of the storyline, because that\u2019s to be expected in a long-running series. As an artist, one\u2019s creation will evolve, and Ward views these people as real, probably as real as they seem to me, but probably even more real. And real people do change.I will say this as well, I believe in eternal life. I believe that life doesn\u2019t end on this plane. I believe that death is an enemy in that it steals love ones away from their beloveds, hopefully not forever, but sometimes it is forever. Our mortal bodies fail us and we leave this life and go to another place. I\u2019m a Christian, so I believe that Heaven and Hell are real. For the Brothers, it\u2019s the Fade. But I think the pain is the same, knowing that you won\u2019t see a beloved again in this life. And when one is dying, it\u2019s facing one\u2019s mortality, and the question of whether what you\u2019ve believed that whole time was real or not.My two cats (that I had for pretty much their whole, long lives) died this past fall, and it broke my heart to pieces. They were older and I should have been prepared. I work in animal medicine, and I lost my dad about ten years ago, so death is not new to me. But it still wrenched my soul to lose them. It\u2019s funny what people say and don\u2019t say to you when you lose someone. I had people say some things that were quite ugly even though they didn\u2019t mean it that way, and that didn\u2019t help my emotional healing. I also had people who ministered to me in my grief, and understood exactly how I felt. They can\u2019t know how much they helped me, but I say a prayer of thanks that God put them in my path at the right time.  I think this book touched me because I saw one of the characters go on that journey. The stages of grief were so tangible to me because of my recent loss (and quite honestly, I also lost a church friend recently, so I was dealing with that as well). I could feel what it was like for this character and the pain of losing a person, but also the fact that they could not ever have regrets about having loved that person, for however short that time was. It\u2019s real for me. I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m thinking that Ward went through a loss recently, and she wrote this from her heart. I connected with that, and I can see why she didn\u2019t change the ending to a \u201chappy, joy, joy\u201d one that would be expected. Sometimes, that\u2019s not the way life works. Sometimes, you lose people and you have to get out of bed the next day. You have to attend to the ceremonies that come along with the loss and keep one foot in front of the other until you can walk without falling. Sometimes you have to be strong so you can be strong for another person who needs that strength, and put your own needs aside. That was all so real to me, and very well-written.Others may not like how that was done. I respect that. While it sucked that this person died, it was also valuable in the terms of the story. I can\u2019t fault Ward for that decision. I\u2019ve seen her make others in her stories that I was more angry about. I think she handled the situation with grace, even in the most ugly and emotionally wrenching parts. I think she knows that people are going to be angry with her, and she owns it. I respect her for that.Speaking of things that made me angry, Xcor was a real tool in this book. I had started seeing more potential for him as a future hero in the past few books, but now I\u2019m just annoyed at him and I question his value as a future love interest for a certain person. I really disliked what he did, for numerous reasons. Those who know my tastes can probably pinpoint why, and can understand why I wanted to bitchslap him. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand his character or the whys but it was a jerk move. At some point you have to stop being a whiny baby and say no to the past and declare a better future. I hold out hope that he\u2019ll get a clue, but he\u2019ll need to get a cleansing deep inside and outside before everything will be okay with me.I continue to like Layla\u2019s character. She\u2019s really growing as a three-dimensional character in her own right. I wasn\u2019t happy about that storyline with Qhuinn at first, but now I\u2019m okay with it. I think it\u2019s an interesting dynamic, and I want to see where things lead with her and her ancillary relationship with Qhuinn and Blay. I just want her to have a Hellren who is worthy of her. She deserves it! I hope the male she\u2019s in love with gets his head out of his rear end sometime soon.One of the things I absolutely loved about this book was the relationship between iAm and Trez, and how things turned around, and the one who always made sacrifices got to be the one who was put first in a crucial way. iAm is a really classy guy, a worthy male, and while Trez did have some jerk moments in the past few books, I really liked him in this book and felt for him. He proves to be a very worthy male (although I don\u2019t agree with his view of prostitution being okay as long as the women get the lion\u2019s share of their earnings). Yes, they don\u2019t consider themselves black or African American, but I liked that they do represent people of color in this book so well. I also found the s\u2019Hisbe culture fascinating. In some ways, it\u2019s not super well-defined, but it\u2019s intriguing to me. An interesting compare and contrast to the Vampire and Sympath cultures. \u2018s\u2019Ex is some kind of dude. On the real! He has swagger like my beloved Rehvenge, and that is a very nice comparision from a reader who is stone cold in love with Rehv! I hope we see more of him. I like one of the new characters introduced very much, which I cannot reveal as a spoiler. Thumbs up for her. That was super-sweet too what happens with her and another character.A few things I was indifferent about as well. I am indifferent about the Lesser storyline. It doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere. We\u2019ll see what happens in the next book. I can\u2019t make up my mind how I feel about Assail. I hate drug abuse/activity, so he\u2019s got a major strike against him. At the same time, I do appreciate the pragmatism of his character. I think he truly is amoral, and he sticks true to that. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll turn out to be an antihero or a full on villain. I have this sick appreciation for a good antihero, I freely admit.I feel like the Band of Brothers storyline was underrepresented in this book, but I think Ward is saving it for the next book and chose to focus on other aspects. It will be interesting to see what happens between Xcor and Throe (and I\u2019m glad that Wrath ain\u2019t nobody\u2019s fool when it comes to that situation). I wish she\u2019d spent more time on the BoB instead of developing the new storyline with Paradise. I don\u2019t hate her, but I can\u2019t say I really care that much about her right now. Having said that, I\u2019ll definitely be reading the spinoff series, even though I think it\u2019s Ward\u2019s bid for the New Adult niche (and I\u2019m not interested in that genre).So, yes, I think I could go on about this book, but I\u2019ve already written such a long review. It won\u2019t change anything. I\u2019m pretty set on how I rated the book. I own it. I liked this book a whole lot. I enjoy Ward\u2019s writing. I love the elegance of the old races she writes about, juxtaposed to the gritty modern world. I even like the thug slang and urban ways of the Brothers (as odd as some find it). I know a lot of folks hate that, but I feel that it\u2019s characteristic of her writing, and I smile every year when I get to hang out with the Brothers and their ever-growing circle of acquaintances. I think that Ward really loves writing about these characters and that joy is infectious to me as a reader. I wish that some of my favorites were more front and center, but most of them had their day in the sun and it\u2019s time to let someone else take the center focus. I will say it was nice to see more of Rhage and Mary in this book.I guess I\u2019m always going to enjoy Ward\u2019s book for what they are. I don\u2019t expect her to be a perfect writer. She has her quirks like any other artist, but I think she\u2019s a darn good writer, and I love this world she\u2019s created, even more with each book. I added The Shadows to my BDB hardcover shelf with a feeling of proprietary pride. Enough Said!"}, {"userName": "Annie (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489554-annie-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "J.R. Ward changes the game with THE SHADOWS with not just one hero, but two in Trez and iAm. As these two brothers have their stories told, expect a lot of emotion, action and passion. All of these things are things I\u2019ve come to expect in a J.R. Ward book, but especially in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.The Shadows have been in the series for a long time, but since they were just on the sidelines I never gave them much thought until now. As the eldest of the two, Trez is the Anointed One and he has responsibilities that are required of him. However that isn\u2019t all that fate has in store for him. Because when Trez falls for a woman, he falls hard and everything we have come to know about the man changes when life takes a wrong turn. Unable to control the events that are happening around him, you as the reader feel his anguish. It\u2019s hard to read. Very, very hard. But at the same time, Ward goes back to basics and Trez\u2019s story almost reminds me of the earlier books with Rhage and Mary and the sweet romance they shared. Unfortunately things are different with Trez and his shellan and even though it devastates me, I don\u2019t hate Ward for her choices.There are two reasons why it works for me: One, it\u2019s because Ward drops a lot of clues as to what is going to happen before it does so as I picked up on it earlier on it wasn\u2019t such a shock as some of the past events in the series. That being said though, I stilled sobbed like a baby when it happened and had to stop reading because I could no longer read the words any longer.And two, because the romance is so very potent for these two. I definitely got the sense that they were happy. Like I said, Ward conveys emotion so well.iAm\u2019s romance comes across as slightly different. It takes a while to develop and how it comes to be may also come as a shock to readers but again, I found that I enjoyed their dynamics together. Ward\u2019s romance is really about putting together the hero and heroine and then letting the emotions flow as they come and I definitely felt a strong connection between these two.Now in addition to The Shadows, Ward focuses a lot on progressing the world. There are bonds broken, some bonds forged and it\u2019s quite interesting to see such progress in one book. Ward really paced this book out well, reaching all areas of the world and giving readers a wide scope of things without diluting any of the romances.If you\u2019re an Original Brothers junkie as I am, then you\u2019ll be thrilled to know that MY BABY RHAGE IS HERE. Hallelujah! I don\u2019t think I could have been any more happier when I saw the multiple POVs from him. Sitting up straighter, eyes going wide like lasers, I devoured all of Rhage\u2019s moments. If you look closely, it makes sense to see him come to the forefront again in this book. And it broke my heart to see him so afraid, but again Ward handles his emotions with poise. I\u2019m hoping she gives us more of him and Mary. They will always remain as my favorites.Progress with Layla and Xcor are present as well. As are the Band of Brothers and Assail. Qhuinn\u2019s brother, Luchas has some interesting things happening to him that also pulls on the heartstrings so THE SHADOWS is an all-around heartache waiting to happen. My advice to you is to have tissues ready. Lots of them.And it\u2019s not just because it\u2019s all sadness. I cried like a sap at all the sweet, romantic bits too. Ward\u2019s writing definitely puts your life in perspective, making you grateful for what you have. It\u2019s poignant and touching and I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing.Interestingly, Ward introduces Paradise, the daughter to Abalone and the new heroine of her Black Dagger Legacy series, BLOOD KISS. She\u2019s very, very likeable and I see remnants of Beth and Xhex in her so it\u2019ll be interesting to see what her actions in the future will mean for the series. Her hero, Craeg is also introduced and I can tell he\u2019s going to be another sweetheart. All of this makes me SO EXCITED. I cannot wait to return to the training with Tohr. I wonder if it\u2019ll be like JM, Qhuinn and Blay all over again?THE SHADOWS is not anything I expected. At all. Ward pulls off the twist of all twists, proving that she\u2019s fearless when it comes to staying true to her characters. With the amount of emotions this book packs, your heart will surely burst. And if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll love every minute of it.Read my alternate review at Fresh Fiction"}, {"userName": "Stacia (the 2010 club)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013351-stacia-the-2010-club", "userReview": "[allowing a book to not have a HEA (even if we know Trez will get one eventually) (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "AJ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3143126-aj", "userReview": "5 Brilliantly devastating starsIf you\u2019re a BDB fan, then you\u2019ll know what to expect from this series, and once again, JR Ward totally delivered. This is a multi-layered story with action, suspense, excitement, romance, sex, multiple love stories and heaps of emotion. In fact this book totally ripped my heart out. But OMG, it\u2019s such an amazing story! I went into this book with an idea of how I thought it would all go down, and while I had the general idea right, the story has some huge surprises, and took me places I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting! I love that about a story, and while I was a blubbering mess for a good portion of it, I reveled in every moment. As the title suggests, the story centres around \u201cThe Shadows\u201d \u2013 Trez and iAm. Long time characters in the series, their stories have started to develop in the later books, and this time we get up close and personal with the mysterious twins. I\u2019m not going to go into detail about their backstory, because their history is well developed before this book starts (don\u2019t even think about reading this series out of order!!!), and the way everything plays out for them is a real surprise - it\u2019s best to watch it all unfold as it happens. I do need to say though, that the romance in this book is beautiful! Trez, in particular, surprised me with how romantic he is! I loved seeing him all loved up, and with every word and gesture, I was in a total swoon.\n\u201cI love you so much. I love you so deeply. I love you forever.\u201d\niAm is equally amazing as the man who will do anything for his brother. I love the direction his story took - definitely a surprise, but a very welcome one.And there is a lot more going on with the Brothers and their extended crew\u2026Of course, seeing any of the \u2018old school\u2019 Brothers is always a highlight, and I absolutely adored revisiting with one of my favourites - Rhage and \u201chis Mary\u201d, with many chapters from his POV. There are things happening with Hollywood and I am beyond thrilled that he will be getting the next book in the series!\n\u201cThis is calm, cool, and collected, you little bitch. You don\u2019t want to see me pissed off.\u201d\nThere is some more story progression for Layla. Her strange and secretive time with Xcor continues, and things are still slowly moving along there. But it\u2019s her relationship with Qhuinn and Blay that I love the best \u2013 the dynamic between the trio is gorgeous.Xcor and the BOBs appear, with a bit more of a focus on Throe, whose allegiances are now highly suspect, and we check in briefly with Assail.We also get to meet Paradise, daughter of Abalone and heroine of the upcoming Blood Kiss, book one in the spin off series Black Dagger Legacy. She\u2019s a feisty girl, brought up in the pampered world of the Glymera, but secretly wishing for something more, I really like her. We are briefly introduced to her love interest and I am so excited for their story. I enjoyed all of the time spent with the Brothers, and seeing the goings on in the mansion, and the dynamics between the larger group is sensational as always. Packed full of Ward-isms, the writing is fast paced but still descriptive and HIGHLY emotive. I was quickly sucked into the story and totally wrapped up in the BDB world. This story is a fantastic addition to the series.

I woke up, went about my day, and felt composed enough to write my review. Then I see my news feed... People actually returning this book, because they are not happy with the ending. What do you expect from the author? An apology and a promise to write something more catered to you and your fragile feelings? Everyone has different tastes, if you didn't like it... oh well. This isn't a library. This is 2015 and we've came a long fucking way from skirting around story lines that take people out of their comfort zones.I am seeing people actually writing things like:\"How did her editor let her get away with that one???\"-Ummm, because it's her fucking book and her fucking world. The world isn't perfect, and people die. The beauty in this book is the life Selena lived, and the unconditional love Trez showed. They didn't need a HEA, because in the real world we are not promised one.\"Romance books are supposed to end with a working relationship between the hero and heroine.\"-Let's talk about other romantic relationships. A woman has had to finally watch her husband lose his battle to cancer. Or a man that now has to mourn the death of his wife that died giving birth to his child. Their love isn't as powerful, or romantic, as others who have been fortunate enough to keep their soulmates by their side? Who are we to define what a romance should or should not have as long as love is the main component? Or to burn books over outcomes we wish could be different? Love is love, and has no bounds or absolute ending. And why in the hell would we bother reading anything if we knew the ending already? \"You broke that trust.\"-Trust? You are guaranteed nothing at the end of a novel. Last time I checked, I didn't see a HEA 100% GUARANTEE sticker on the cover of any of JR Ward's books. A good author will give you plot twists, will make you question things, will make you feel things. Am I okay with Selena dying? No, I cried harder for this book than any book I've read in years. But I also realize this is a fictional world, and JR Ward made me feel things that most authors can't come close to scratching. This was real, and honest, and opens your eyes that not every day we have is promised. Live and love to the fullest, without any regrets. If those amazing feelings equate to a bad book, then Miss Ward, you have wrote the shittiest book of all time. I'm sorry for the rant, but this story was beautiful. I feel terrible seeing mud slung upon it. My problem, as of lately, is that authors conform to what their \"fans\" want, and it completely ruins the world they've put their heart and soul in. Yes, I'm looking at you - KMM. You can tell JR Ward bleeds for this story she's created, and she should be respected for not presenting each book with a shiny perfect bow just to please the masses that can't handle gut wrenching heart break. (Because this book is filled with it)All this ranting about Trez and Selena's unfortunate situation, I don't want to leave iAm in the shadows (ba dum tss). I loved every scene between him and the princess, even the uncomfortable \"he's going to flip shit when he realizes\" moments. I loved all the twists and turns of their story line (especially when the queen's deceit surfaced). I know many are upset that Trez and Selena were unable to have a HEA, but I tried not to let that take away from iAm's much deserved one.I know I'm not the norm, and I will do my best to dodge all of your tomatoes (or Mary/Rhage Potatoes, ew). Maybe seeing how gorgeous this book was delivered to me will make your hearts thaw a little.\u2764\ufe0fI also want to mention, the character growth is this book was exquisite. Besides everything the twins had to overcome/endure, there was s'Ex. Seriously.. he won me over. Hook, line, sinker. He is probably the reason this book got pushed to five stars for me. I will now forever be in anticipation for a book about him. His redemption for his murdered child was my favorite part of this book. Speaking of anticipation over BDB books... The cover for Blood Kiss has been realeased, and I saw a blonde (without reading anything) and started squealing with happiness! I thought it was Layla... CRUEL WORLD. Jesus, I am so addicted to her and Xcor's story line... I need it, Miss Ward, please stop being a tease. Even with that being said, I'm super fucking hyped for this new direction JR Ward is going, I can't wait for December.Blog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch"}, {"userName": "Midgetbee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8783181-midgetbee", "userReview": "This should've been called 'Jane Whitcomb Runs the Clinic and Everyone Loves Her'. In fact just name all the books that from now on, it'll save time. The further into the series the books go and the more it becomes less about the Brotherhood themselves and them fighting an all-out war against the lessers and the more the books become all about Doc Jane and all the patients she treats. The Brothers barely even fight any more. Instead they stand around Wrath, flexing slightly and growling. I get the series needs to move on and there needs to be new characters but why are all the main storylines these days about what's going on in the damn clinic? Ms Ward, some of us don't like Doc Jane. We didn't like her in Lover Unbound, we didn't like her in Lover Unleashed, we didn't like her in Lover at Last, or The King and guess what, we don't like her here either. She doesn't need half the book. There are other doctors. Let one of them treat a patient. I don't care if she's cracking wise, crying over patients or banging Vishous in a supposedly sanitary examination room. You've already tried to rewrite half the series to get people to like her. It didn't work. Quit it.I don't care if every character in the book says how much they love her either. So you can cut that out too.Basically the main plot of the book centres around Selena dying and Trez trying to get out of becoming the next Shadow Queen's personal sex slave and all the drama as everyone tries to give them a happy ending while the two of them go out on dates and try to pretend everything will work out just fine.I'm losing my patience with this series. Like I said, clinic drama, all the time, every time. Plotlines are dropped, the ending doesn't play out to the tone of the rest of the series and where the heck is Muhrder? Yet another book his return is promised, and yet another no show. It's just another case of Ward pushing her favourites to the forefront, plot cohesion be damned. I'm just happy we got to see some more of Rhage so there was someone in the book I actually gave a damn about."}, {"userName": "MELISSA *Mel Reader*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10312276-melissa-mel-reader", "userReview": "4 Stars! (BR with Sharon)\nDestiny was as uncaring and influential as the wind to a flag, carrying the fabric of an individual's existence this way and that, subjecting that which it rocked to its whims without an inquiry as to what the banner may have desired.\n\nTrez Latimer is a shadow who was sold to the queen of the S'Hsibe as a child to one day as the Anointed One sire the next generation of queens. He is condemned by the position of the stars, and his purpose was to be used for procreation. His is miserable & self destructive until he meets the chosen Selena.

I really enjoyed the relationships of the two shadows & their women they love. Near the end I kept having to take breaks because I kept crying, & I NEVER cry!!! It was a book full of emotion that tugs at your heart.\nBut my favorite thing about this book was the beautiful bond these two brothers shared!
