My first teaching job plunked me down in a non-air-conditioned overcrowded school in Little Havana (in the heart of the city of Miami, FL for you non-natives) with 100% of my students hailing from Cuba, South America, Puerto Rico, etc. Well, life imitates art, I guess. My first year was a pretty miserable failure and I did not achieve my glorified vision of \"the Great White non-Hispanic Hope\" (Hey, I said I was naive, right?). They ate my upper middle class white butt for lunch! But, man did I LEARN from my kids. Hard lessons to be sure, but critical to my nascent years as a teacher. That's what this book popping up in my Goodreads wanderings makes me realize. Once I learned that I wasn't the only one in the room with something worthwhile to teach, I really became a teacher. Sometimes it's better to close your mouth and open your ears and hear what the kids have to teach you. I'm still naive, thank goodness, and still hope to make a difference with the teachers I prepare to teach-I just never assume I'm the only one with something to say."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "This is an enlightening book and also obviously the book of a young man as it is at times both overwhelmingly idealistic and alarmingly naive. Pat Conroy agreed to teach for a year on Yamacraw Island off the coast of South Carolina. There he encounters a world apart, conditions unlike anything he has encountered in his teaching on the mainland. He is to teach the children of the island, the people who used to live from fishing but now can't support themselves from polluted waters. He encounters children who are savvy but unschooled for all the time they have spent in the classroom. He learns of various types of prejudice that attack them individually and as a group in order to keep them untaught and unteachable. There is an overarching lack of concern as long as discipline is maintained.Conroy writes of his experiments in teaching methods and his gambles with the authorities to try new activities with the children. He also daringly spares the rod! This is an eye-opening memoir, even though it is no longer a new book. It remains a worthwhile read. Perhaps my greatest take-away from it is to try to know the people to whom I speak, with whom I would like to work or deal. The surface definitely does not reveal all.Conroy's prose is beautiful; he captures the natural world around him so wonderfully. He also captures the individual children and their families so well. You will feel that you have met many of them by the time you have finished reading this book."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "I want everybody to read, no listen to, The Water is Wide. It is that good a book. There are sublime sentences, most often straight out of the mouths of the eighteen black kids whom he's teaching, 1969-970, on Yamacraw Island (Daufuski Island), South Carolina. Until he got kicked out for insubordination after one year as a teacher! That is told at the very beginning so it is no spoiler. He is a fantastic teacher. He is the kind of teacher these kids needed. In the prologue the author says how he felt the narration of his book by Dan Jon Miller was pure perfection. It captures the essence of his kids' lives. It improves what is at bottom a wonderful book. He tells his story with humor, yet its topic is very serious."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1887310-irene", "userReview": "In 1969, Pat Conroy, a young idealistic teacher, accepted a position at a two room school house on an impoverished and isolated island off the coast of South Carolina. He is assigned the class of 5th-8th graders. The largely segregated school district of which this island was a part, had presumed that these Black children were inherently incapable of learning and treated them accordingly. He found a group of 18 students who could not recite the alphabet, let alone read, could not count to 10, let alone multiply, did not know the name of their country, let alone understand its history. This is his memoir of that year trying to engage, empower and expose these children to the wider world. Conroy obviously cares deeply for these children and is proud of his efforts, so this is an upbeat, funny and heart-warming book despite the frustrations of battling a discriminatory system."}, {"userName": "Kellie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/842772-kellie", "userReview": "I was really impressed with this book. Not only did I enjoy the story, which is true, but I also enjoyed the writing of Pat Conroy. This is the first book I have read by Conroy. This is about the experience Conroy had in the early 70\u2019s teaching in a one room school house on Yamacraw Island (which is the pseudonym for Daufuskie Island), an island off the coast of South Carolina. This island was populated by mostly African Americans. The experience was truly eye opening . It really depicted the society of that time: Civil Rights, Segregation and Southern Culture and it\u2019s resistance to change. Conroy took a true life experience and put in down on paper in such a way that the reader felt like they were there on the island with him. Add to that an exceptional sense of humor that was drizzled throughout the story and you have yourself a masterpiece. I have added all of the rest of Conroy\u2019s books on my wishlist and I feel a little bit more with the program after finally reading one of his works."}, {"userName": "BAM The Bibliomaniac ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac", "userReview": "I realize this book has an underlying focus on racism in the South in the late '60s, but the other plot line I what resonated with me-a gifted teacher unfairly losing his job. I lost mine 10 years ago, gosh as long ago now as I taught. It was quite difficult for me to read how inspired Conroy was in the classroom, how much he cared about his students and their minds and futures only to be told he's insubordinate and no longer wanted. \"To fire me so insensitively is one thing, but they try to destroy my personal reputation\". YES I know this feeling. Conroy and I are both not ass kissers, which in the education system that runs on a political hierarchy , is a much craved expectation. All teachers have worked with a Mrs. Brown, a Piedmont, an Edna. We all have our opinions about these people. To me the discrimination was against poverty. Sadly in this country more African Americans are found in the lower economic groups. These children had no chance. And no one cared."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1180394-maureen", "userReview": "This was the first Pat Conroy book I read, and several years later, I had an opportunity to spend some time on Yamacraw, the island where he taught school. It was a magical place, with sandy roads shaded by great oak trees dripping with spanish moss. The people lived in backwards conditions, but they were tied to the land and their relationship with the land and the ocean in a way that few if any of the rest of us will ever experience. This is an inspiring, uplifting book and I am a better person for having read it,"}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Pat Conroy's memoir of his year teaching 1969-70. It's kids of Gullah dialect S.C. island living who don't have cultural context to the English and other subjects, like American History and reading skills- that he is trying to teach them. He tries to use active trips, other activities which give experience and relate to their family and island life- instead of the usual physical consequence and heavily redundant reciting lessons of former and approved school structure. So he argues with the boss. Originally I read this years ago and it was a quick reread. And I was surprised on how dated I found it now compared to then. And rather more condescending than previously came across in the former read from many years ago. Conroy was very young and with the Citadel not far behind him. but he learns as much as his kids do during this teaching sojourn. Possibly more. Not being Southern or of such rigid knowledge base and language forms for optimal English as existed at this time and during the year recorded here, I must say something. When I read this before I tended to feel he had become \"enlightened\" in the sense of his value system and perceptions. And he does to some extent. But in a larger, much larger picture, I now, in age, compare it to a classroom in which the class does NOT have a common language, be it Gullah or dialect, or standard anything. And hold languages that come from at least 3 continents. One in which there are 5 or 6 countries of origin and different age levels by 3 or 4 years represented and maybe half not having heard English because they do not even have a TV. Well, some of us had TV but weren't allowed to watch much more than the Variety Hour or Gunsmoke. Mainly because of not passing grades of their required and mandatory testing, many are not even in their age appropriate grade level. And one in which their foods for lunch brought from home (no food at school ever), are nearly unrecognizable to each other. One in which students were seated at heat registers for desks because there were not enough desks to go around. And where 5 foot 4 inch boys were put into chairs designed for 3rd graders. And still those nuns taught us well. We learned. And I cannot remember ever going on a field trip until seventh grade. We also had 60 to 62 per nun in each small classroom. More than twice what is considered class room size in the \"worst\" schools today. And most of these Dominican sisters taught for 40 years in the same place until all of their students were Baptist and not a one was Catholic. I just had to give a shout out for them. That was a task. And all of their students were main-streamed even then, too. If there were severe disability, we had to take turns \"teaching\" each other. Because there was too many of us and we did not have cars or buses available, few could even reach any kind of Public school \"inclusion\". Few of our parents owned a car. Most walked as I did, and we were not allowed to ride bikes, because there was no place to safely put them. More than 2 miles each way as I did, be it blizzard or NO air conditioning on a 98 degree September day. This book made me realize how much more difficult it must have been for those women with all those heavy clothes on too. Especially in the heat. But did they do a good job! I wish one of them would have written a memoir."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael", "userReview": "This was another outstanding book by Pat Conroy,he is a amazing storyteller. This book really makes you think about how society and how racism plays a big part in it. The characters were believable and you often felt sympathy for some of the characters. What separates Pat from most authors is the fact that lives what he writes, he is not just telling the story but he actually lived through it."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "I had gotten a copy of this book a while back for a few reasons:1. It takes place in SC2. Pat Conroy is a SC writer3. I like some of his stuff, despite his lunatic family4. I had fond memories of the movie5. One of my favorite folk songs is \"The Water is Wide\".6. A friend of mine is mentioned in the afterword.I saw the movie made from this book when I was a teenager, a few years before my family moved to South CArolina. It made a big impression on me, so it was with some trepidation that I actually picked up the book to read. At first I was uncomfortable. There's a lot of bigotry and racial stuff in the opening that made me cringe. I hated that this was what people would think of South Carolina. I also hated how there seemed to be no middle ground for the adult characters- either they were horrible racists, or holier than thou liberals. But then, I started realizing how far the social structure of this state has come since the book was written. It's changed a great deal in the years since I first moved here, (one would hope!!), and was already moving away from some of the worse stuff portrayed in the book by the time I arrived here in 1971. Unfortunately, there still exist great pockets of ignorance and poverty though.The real hero, to me, is the SC wetlands- the marshes and river and the estuaries that I so love in the lowcountry. There is great beauty here. That is why I am including this book in a m-nag with a special mission."}, {"userName": "Howard", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32041201-howard", "userReview": "Reread."}, {"userName": "LibraryCin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin", "userReview": "When Pat Conroy was a new teacher, he set out for a small island off the coast of South Carolina in 1969/70 to teach poor kids at a black school there. What a culture shock! Not only did these kids mostly not know how to read or write, but they had never experienced Halloween! Pat did a lot for these kids over the year, and taught them in unorthodox ways. I thought this was a memoir, but it was only at the very end of the book that it said it was \u201cbased on\u201d his year on the island. I think it also said \u201cfiction\u201d somewhere, but I may be mixing that up with a review I read. I did disagree with one thing he did/argued for, but overall, I was enjoyed this book.

He offers to take a teaching position on Yamacraw Island only to realize that these children have been overlooked and basically treated like crap because they're black and poor. Conroy's idealism and belief that right and wrong are the only thing that matters leads to him becoming a passionate advocate of the island children, and earns him the enmity of people who just want to continue to ignore the islanders.I have to admit that he seems to spend more time teaching the kids about life than he does trying to teach them to read. He's regularly harangued by the the woman who's been there for a long time because, she assures him, he needs to stick to the textbook and beat them if they don't behave. Which would be how they managed to get through four years under her tutelage and still be illiterate? Right, that's because they're stupid.This story is both uplifting and heartbreaking because you have this man who is a believer and really wants to change things facing off with the people who want to keep the status quo. So Conroy is inspiring but it's heartbreaking to see him struggle.Part of the reason that I was interested in this book was because I read The Prince of Tides last year. It was really cool to see how elements of his experiences here were woven into that story even though The Prince of Tides is fiction.

The year was the 1969-70 school year and the island populated by highly disadvantaged sea islanders, mostly African-American with a handful of custodial whites who run the island and its limited services. Conroy, in his young twenties, a relatively recent graduate from The Citadel, had taught high school on the mainland for a couple of years. He is shocked by the impact of the historical malign neglect represented by the two room school house on Yamacraw\u2014of course segregated until a few years before by policy and during Conroy\u2019s moment by the demographics of the island. It is an engaging, if self-centered tale, written in the immediate wake of Conroy\u2019s termination after a year and a month or so on the job, where he stirs things up by trying to broaden the horizons of his 18 students. He takes them on field trips to Trick or Treat in Beaufort, South Carolina, to Washington, D.C. to visit the nation\u2019s capital with all its monuments, museums, and most impressively, its zoo. He fights with the other teacher, also the principal, and the county educational leaders, all of whom see satisfied with a traditional approach to instruction, one heavy on textbook drills and corporal punishment that nonetheless leaves several of Conroy\u2019s older students unable to read or even recite the alphabet. Conroy himself admits a journey from casual but eager racist as a teen to bleeding heart liberal by the time of his teaching career. Why it\u2019s not explored or why the children and their families don\u2019t provide inspiration for a more examined understanding of their situation isn\u2019t clear. The book is too much Conroy in the moment, mitigated but not redeemed by self-deprecating admissions of his too passionate, too insufferable assuredness. The prose is mostly pedestrian colloquial (he uses \u201ccrap\u201d way too much), but quick moving and sometimes beautiful. On the Washington road trip, one of his students asks about the lines on the road, something Conroy, like all of us perhaps, takes for granted. \u201cTo Jasper, who was accustomed to unpaved roads, they represented something strange, unexplained, and beyond his framework of experience. For the rest of the trip Barbara and I decoded road signs, billboards, and numbers painted on bridges and overpasses. Things I had not noticed for ten years now assumed great significance. I regretted that I could not be making this trip with the freshness of insight and beautiful innocence of Jasper and the others. I regretted that I was old, that I could no longer appreciate the education afforded by an American highway, and that I could not grasp the mystery of a single line painted down a road going north.\u201d I regretted that there weren\u2019t more passages like that and that Conroy passed on an opportunity to truly bear witness to a unique time, place, and culture. The real Yamacraw Island is Daufuskie Island, an island between the city of Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, that like its neighbor has since become a resort island. Conroy\u2019s goal was to do whatever he could to help his students see a way off the island but larger forces conspired more effectively to achieve that goal. The Water Is Wide is an entertaining relic of a former time that might have been much more."}, {"userName": "Sidna ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2384898-sidna", "userReview": "What can I say? I LOVE Pat Conroy's writing! In My Losing Season the way he describes a basketball game is pure poetry. While I was hanging about the local bookseller (as opposed to a book store) waiting for Conroy to write another book, I realized I had never read The Water is Wide. I don't know how I missed a Conroy book. I bought a copy and devoured it as soon as I got home! After having read all his other books and knowing his family history, it was an interesting read. He wrote this book before he decided to tell the world about his family. Unfortunately, the problems he describes in the school on an island in South Carolina where he taught for a year, occur in far too many schools. The administration doesn't want to be bothered with students in poor areas of many school districts and keeps them down instead of giving them a hand up. Parts of the book are absolutely hilarious!When I read most of Conroy's books, I was a Yankee who never wanted to live in the South. Conroy made the South seem surreal. Now I have lived in Memphis for three years. Memphis is not the deep South, but living here has given me a different understanding of the South and I had a deeper appreciation for what Conroy was describing. I can't wait to read South of Broad! I don't care if the critics pan his books. I hope he never stops writing!What amazed me was that after I finished reading this book, I went to put it on the shelf with my other Conroy books and realized that I already owned a copy!

I did not then but have later understood how the system perpetuated racial stereotypes. I have also experienced how the rural South has changed maybe not for all and not as completely as it can, but largely due to visionaries like Pat Conroy who early on made that change the disparities are not as great and not as pervasive.

It started with Prince of Tides and continues with Lords of Discipine and The Great Santini. His is a powerful voice, and I'm glad I'm not involved in any organization or situation that he is interested in. He is a gadfly, afflicting the comfortable. I can see why his strong opinions and vocal criticism would get people's backs up in opposition. He comes on so strong that those who don't share his opinions cannot take the necessary step back to gain some perspective. In this case, revenge is a dish served cold in his memoir of his year teaching on the island before he is fired. I hope the book made a difference in the lives of the people he writes about. Since it was written in 1972, and the children now receive their education off-island via ferry, I suppose it was worth it. If nothing else, the book turned a spotlight onto one dark corner of discrimination and neglect.

He has such a keen sense of description. He doesn't use a lot of words, yet manages to be very precise in his details. This detail makes his characters vivid and memorable. There are crappy teachers who care more for their job than the students, and then there are the ones who roll up their sleeves and reach with both hands in order to make a difference. Teachers need to be teachable. Some of the problems with public schools that were addressed in this book, are still problems that afflict many public schools today.

I really wanted to like him because he's from the South, and many people love his Southern literature. I liked a few of his earlier works that I read when I was much younger, but I found the stories in his later works of fiction to be just ridiculous, contrived, and far-fetched. I particularly despised Beach Music and South of Broad. I kept hearing from Conroy fans that I should read The Water is Wide and The Great Santini. These were the 2nd and 3rd books he wrote. So I read The Water is Wide after grabbing a copy for my Kindle on Amazon for $1.99. I thought it was excellent. Memoir is my favorite genre anyway, and I think because this book was based on his personal experience the story just made a lot more sense, and he didn't try so hard to embellish and make it so flowery. That being said, he is incredibly eloquent in this book in telling about the situation he was in, and I found that I enjoyed his writing very much. I am currently reading some other works on racial reconciliation, and this book about Conroy's experience as a teacher during integration in the South was a good complement to those other works.

His many novels like The Lords of Discipline, The Prince of Tides, South of Broad, and others highlighted his mastery of metaphor. To read a Pat Conroy novel is to indulge in word paintings that are so beautiful, so vivid, that we can see, smell, hear, and savor the Southern\u2014mostly South Carolinian\u2014landscape. Delight in his stories, revel in complex characters, but read his books for his descriptions alone, and you will have had a supremely rewarding experience. Conroy lived a long, rich life, and for us, he died far too young. But we rejoice in his legacy. And that legacy includes his second novel, The Water Is Wide.Before Conroy was a writer, he was a teacher. Early in his career, he grew tired of the high school in which he taught with its institutionalized racism. He acquired a job on Daufuskie Island, off the coast of South Carolina. There he taught the poor black children that inhabited an island\u2014in the late 1960s\u2014that was filled with uneducated, almost destitute, black families. That experience became the basis for The Water Is Wide. The book is called a novel, but Conroy himself is the main character, and he writes of the experience so vividly that one is very much inclined to believe that most of it is true indeed. Perhaps things were heightened, perhaps \u201cnames were changed to protect the innocent,\u201d perhaps the island\u2019s name was changed so readers wouldn\u2019t flock to it and upset the lives of the residents, but I\u2019m convinced that for the most part, this story is true.But aside from that, Conroy presents us with a world where, even in a mainstream Southern society that was struggling to change attitudes about race, racism was alive and well. And the \u201cpowers that be\u201d were desperately trying to maintain the status quo. In Conroy\u2019s story, the island has a two-teacher school. One of the teachers is a black woman, a woman who is mean and abusive and racist and wrapped in the fear of her own blackness; the other is Conroy, the tall, blond, extremely white young idealist. We are presented with two philosophies of teaching (and, indeed, two philosophies of treating human beings,) and Conroy\u2019s way of thinking shows us the better path. Faced with older children who cannot recite the alphabet or even tell him who the President of the US is, Conroy does what he can to win their confidence and begin their learning. His biggest tool is humor. I particularly liked reading of his presentation of lessons, for having been a thirty-year veteran of teaching myself, I, too, found that students respond to humor, and making them laugh gains their trust and attention quicker than anything else. In the novel, however, Conroy faces strong opposition to his unorthodox ways\u2014both from his co-teacher and from the education leaders of the county.This is story of triumph, of one man who made a difference. It is also a story of humility, of a man who saw, perhaps when it was too late, that his youthful arrogance may have been a stumbling block for him. This is also a story of race and the struggle that has been going on since the beginning of time and a man who refused to make that a barrier. And finally, this is a story that truly introduced us to a very fine writer who will be sorely missed.Every teacher needs to read The Water Is Wide; every human needs to read The Water Is Wide. Pat Conroy may have left the teaching profession eventually, but he is still teaching all of us."}, {"userName": "Joann Amidon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28272513-joann-amidon", "userReview": "This was a selection for my book club and I am glad because I do not usually care for Conroy. I found this book instructive of the times and was taken back to 1969 when I was about the same age as Conroy. The one thing I could not have experienced as he did was the situation on the island with the children. He certainly brings that and his encounter with them clearly to the reader. There are light, funny moments but, for me, mostly I wondered how such a situation ever came to be."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4853941-teresa", "userReview": "I learned things about Pat Conroy's life that I was unaware of. I sure admire his youthful passion and indignation at the inequities in educational opportunities in this small, segregated southern community in the 1960's. As someone who has vacationed numerous times on the South Carolina coast, this sharp look at recent history is very compelling. And, disturbing. How could this have happened in the 60's? I loved his almost lyrical style of writing. The descriptions of the students giving a summary of \"The Wizard of Oz\" made me smile. Who hasn't been charmed by a childhood viewing of that movie? The descriptions of their treatment of animals, their absolute belief in ghosts, their rules for football & basketball games, their inability to swim and fear of the water, and their wonder at their first visit to a zoo were truly memorable. And, the lines on the highway account! How could children never have seen a lined highway?! Conroy's magical writing takes you directly into a scene and makes you feel like you are there experiencing it with him. His willingness to expose his own flaws and insecurities help to develop empathy. The world has lost a great storyteller. Pat Conroy laments his limited opportunity to teach the underprivileged students on the Yamacraw Island. \"I saw the necessity of living and accepting bullcrap in my midst. It was everywhere. In teachers' manuals, in the platitudes muttered by educators, in school boards, in the community, and most significantly, in myself. I could be so self-righteous, so inflexible when I thought that I was right or that the children had been wronged. I lacked diplomacy and would not compromise. To survive in the future I would have to learn the complex art of ass-kissing, that honorable American custom that makes the world go 'round. Survival is the most important thing. As a bona fide ass-kisser, I might lose a measure of self-respect, but I could be teaching and helping kids. As it is, I have enough self-respect to fertilize Yankee stadium, but I am not doing a thing for anybody. I could probably still be with the Yamacraw kids had I conquered my ego.\" I like to think Conroy did MORE good by publishing this account and bringing attention to the situation. God speed to a good man."}, {"userName": "Poiema", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1524767-poiema", "userReview": "I love books about teachers--- I have a special bookshelf dedicated to these books--- and this one did not disappoint. Pat Conroy was just launching into his adult life and career in 1969, at the height of the civil rights era. He had a social conversion of sorts that changed the course of his life and career:\"He played 'We Shall Overcome' by Pete Seegar. I remember that moment with crystal clarity and I comprehend it as a turning point in my life: a moment terrible in its illumination of a toad in my soul, an ugliness so pervasive that it seemed my insides were vomit.\"Conroy become a self-described do-gooder, which took him to a small island outside of South Carolina, to be teacher to poor and nearly illiterate children. He took a boat across the water daily, but the divide between him and his young black students was more than geographic. These kids had little knowledge of the world outside of the island:\"the job I had taken to assuage the demon of do-gooderism was a bit more Titanic than anticipated.\"I was amazed and enthralled by his creativity, his drive, and his tenacity. He was hindered mainly by the bureaucrats in the public school system by which he was hired, and the miserable politics of that system ended his short but colorful mission work.At the end, one felt that his teaching was a task so monumental that it could be compared to picking at a mountain with a spoon. Yet there were flashes of brilliance, ways he managed to bring Shakespeare and great music and culture into the lives of the students --- not done according to methodology but by instinct.I judged Conroy to be a worthy teacher in spite of the fact tests could not have registered great increases in students' scholastic achievements. He left his mark on them because he possessed the one thing that's indispensable to a great teacher: LOVE."}, {"userName": "Audrey K.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8888794-audrey-k", "userReview": "4.5 stars. Pat Conroy tells his adventurous story of being a young white teacher of limited experience in 1969, teaching impoverished and minimally-educated black children on the island of Yamacraw, South Carolina. Integration of schools was new, especially in the South, and especially for some of the crusty old types in the school district hierarchy. Integration was not an issue on Yamacraw - all the children inhabiting the island were black. The children do not know basic math, and most do not read or write. They do not know what country they live in, or the current U.S. President in office. This is an eye-opening book, leaving me with a renewed respect and appreciation for all competent teachers, and for my parents. The book drove home the importance of reading to your children, and of providing them with experiences and opportunities. Here from Chapter Six in the book the author makes a comparison between the classroom in Yamacraw, and that of his own childhood: \"How could I compare or relate my childhood to growing up on Yamacraw? My mother's reading to me each night was a celebration of language and tradition, a world of Mother Goose and lyric poetry, where Bobby Shaftoe goes to sea and intrepid, pre-pubic heroes stand on burning decks. My youth was a glut of words, a circus of ideas nurtured by parents dedicated to diplomas and the production of professionals from the tribe of children they sired. My youth sang the glory of books, the psalms of travel, of new faces, of the universe of Disney animation, of Popsicle sticks and county fairs, of parables of war spoken spoken by a flight-jacketed father, of parables of love and Jesus sung by a blue-eyed mother, a renegade Baptist, a converted Catholic, a soldier of the Lord.\""}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1792361-rhonda", "userReview": "I didn't much care for this book when I read it, not because the unorthodox spirit of teaching was so rampant, but because I didn't think it provided functional answers to the education problem. On the other hand, the creative and unorthodox manner of teaching, that's hard to dislike and I wish we had more teachers who thought this way and could teach in a more unstructured way. I read this book thoroughly angry with the school superintendent and the whole town for that matter. I demanded that they become more open minded and allow these kids to do what needed to be done, but I really wasn't thinking of them: like so many young people I had an idealized dream about everyone achieving new levels of understanding, stopping all war and having people pay attention to the arts. In short I was at least as naive as anyone could expect as an enlightened liberal thinker with an advanced degree ...and no job. Still, this book was a romanticized version of what the struggle is all about and I was smart enough then to see that it had skipped over a greater part of life and what people did and how people lived. When I happened to see the movie version of this with Jon Voight, It was good, especially demonstrative of how to teach in new ways. In essence the movie was better than the book.I was tempted to give the book two stars instead of three, but just because of the fact that the new teacher stood up against authority, even though he lost, I am giving it the benefit of the same idealism it preaches. Standing up for what one believes was the right thing to do, even when you are hopelessly naive about the way the world works. It is our overwhelming shame that teachers like this are probably lost by the nonsense of the system today."}], "description": "The island is nearly deserted, haunting, beautiful.
