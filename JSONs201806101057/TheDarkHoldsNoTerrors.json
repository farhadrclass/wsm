Her protagonists though traditional yet are rational and practical. They have a feminist undertone which some what makes the character very real and relatable to me though dwelling upon the past like all her protagonist do is not one of them. 'Dark Holds No Terror' revolves around Sarita, a doctor by profession, an independent women, at least thats what she tries to portray but underneath, there is an emptiness in her which she is unable to fill. Is it not being a good daughter to her parents? or not being a good wife to her husband or failing as mother to children is one of the reason? She is unable to figure out. There is always something she is guilty of no mater what she does but she is not able to grow out of it. Perhaps to search that \u2019something\u2019, one day Sarita leaves her husband, children, her profession and goes back to her maternal home. Wherein she is haunted by her mother's death as well as by her fathers silence. She dwells upon the past, how in her childhood days her mother used to accuse her of her brother\u2019s death even though she was just a child then and how now she is unable to cope up with her husband and children with that past baggage. Yet, somehow she feels safe here at her maternal home, alone, at peace, out of all the daily chaos, with no one to interrupt her thoughts so that she could come to conclusion. Is Sarita\u2019s journey to find herself is fruitful in the end? May be!This was terrifyingly dark and haunting novel. Though the narration used to jump from third person to first still it was not odd, i could go with the flow easily. May be i am accustomed to Deshpande\u2019s writing!Here are few hauntingly beautiful quotes from the book\u2026\"But why is happiness always so unreal? Why does it always seem an illusion? It is grief that has a bulk, a weight, a substance and stays real even after years. Happiness is so evanescent nothing left. Except sensations and feelings.\"\u201cPeople die inch by inch, bit by bit, the agony stretched out until the very last moment. But perhaps it helps, the pain. So that in the end there is nothing but pain. No dead sons, unforgiven daughter and feeble husbands,only pain and desired for death.\""}, {"userName": "Smitha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2481560-smitha", "userReview": "My first book by this author and I was impressed. This is a dark story with psychological undertones. A woman who comes back to her paternal home after her mother's death faces her inner demons. Her mother was a cold woman who seemed to loathe her as she thinks her responsible for her brother's death by drowning, and who had ostracised her after marrying a lower caste good for nothing fellow. The father is meek and low profile, though he sticks up for his daughter on one or two occasions. There is a young boy who is now staying with her father as a paying guest, and they all set up into daily routine soon. I loved reading the book and would be on the lookout for other works by this author."}, {"userName": "Maryanne", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20562-maryanne", "userReview": "A lot of people (including those who recommended it to me) would rightly love this book. It's beautifully written and quite haunting but really wasn't my cup of tea. If you enjoy philosophical writing on the changing role of women in historically oppressive societies it's a wonderful read. As much as I love the idea of philosophical writing on the changing role of women in historically oppressive societies, I find very frequently that I don't enjoy the process of reading it (maybe because it ends up feeling more like a \"process\" than a literary journey.)"}, {"userName": "Vishali", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11577219-vishali", "userReview": "The Dark holds no terrors is a journey of self discovery. This is a story of a succesful independent woman Saritha ,a victim of some unfavorable circumstances and is struggling with her inner demons.Shashi Deshpande tries to empower a modern woman with the idea that one can be a better version of herself by being in the family and not by running away from it.I highly doubt if this can hold true in a patriarchal society that expects women to submit themselves to conventional roles."}, {"userName": "Shilpa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60556998-shilpa", "userReview": "My review:The story is about Sarita, who, as a little girl, doesn't find favour with her mother - a resentment she vents out on her younger brother, their mother's pet. With no friends to confide her turmoil in, the pent up feelings simmer within her for years together. To get away from her claustrophobic life at home, she decides to take up medicine at a Bombay college. Her father, much to her mother's chagrin, \u00a0supports her in her decision and gives her the much-needed respite.Shashi Deshpande has used the stream of consciousness to narrate the story of Sarita. \u00a0Peppered with memories, mostly unpleasant, from her childhood, her youth and \u00a0her married life, the story takes you along a journey that at once feels heartrending and perplexing.How can a mother be so cruel towards her daughter? Why doesn't the father find the courage to speak up against the injustice meted out to his daughter? are some of the thoughts that cross your \u00a0mind as you go further into the story. There are \u00a0moments when you wonder at the human nature - cowering in fear and at the same time cold and calculating, wicked and egotistic!Escaping to a city to follow her dreams, falling in love with a man who, she thinks, will rescue her from her dark past, \u00a0and then realising that life's miseries haven't ended just yet, for the darkness has followed her in her married life, too. For how much respect and money can a poet earn as compared to his doctor wife? Sarita's sorrow tugs at your heart strings.Shashi Deshpande has done a fabulous job in her very first novel written in 1980. The language and the words chosen to portray the turmoil within the human mind and within the four walls of a simple, middle-class family in a small town are perfect. The atmosphere at Sarita's home - her parents' as well as her marital home - is almost tangible.I liked the book, and I am sure you will like it, too. We may not have experienced the sorrow, the injustice Sarita did, but there are moments when one can relate to her story. The importance given to the son over the daughter, ego hassles that arise within a marriage, a domineering parent whose words wound the heart so, the scars stay fresh for years. \u00a0All of this and much more will touch you to the core, leaving you breathless."}, {"userName": "Ravi Prakash", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74740823-ravi-prakash", "userReview": "A very nice novel showing the inferiority of man before a successful woman in a marriage bond... awesome!!"}, {"userName": "Elli", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4199685-elli", "userReview": "This is a novel discussing women's issues through a cultural backdrop of India. It is written by a prize winning Indian author who has written in several genres. She is a resident of Bangelore, however I believe the novel was written in English. No translator's name is obvious. The main character is a woman with issues in her marriage and going back to her childhood home after her mother has died, and after being estranged from the family for years. She is very deeply unhappy and is looking for some direction through this move. Her own biographical data through character description as well as those of her mother (from whom she was primarily estranged and others having a definite impact on her life. More questions are asked than answered, and dialogue as well as description was used to support the unfolding story. Fate is referred to as something the older generations were able to accept and go on with when times seemed impossible. And this theme seemed to be prevalent. Some bonds are just too costly to be broken, so one adapts, on how is determined by the perameters accepted. There is an undertone of acceptance, sometimes reluctantly, and repeating, sometimes gaining a maturity in this happening. Particularly interesting and quite meaningful are the very few conversations between daughter and father talking about things that are just never talked about, at least there and at that time! If the general content is of interest to the reader, I would recommended this book."}, {"userName": "Ahmad", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7898125-ahmad", "userReview": "There's nothing new in what she says or projects, but I'm impressed how she says what she wants to say.
