I have tried to read The Intuitionist 4 times; APEX is a riff on all the good in John Henry Days; Sag Harbor worked better as a short story. But John Henry Days? This is about my 11th time reading it, this time in prep for teaching it again for the first time in almost 10 years. I'm basing the star rating (really a 3 1/2) on this read of it, which for me has lost a little of the magic since a) I know what's going to happen and b) I've poured over every line a 1000 times. But don't be mistaken: the last few chapters are emotional gold. The entirety of the book, conceptually and structurally, is freaking genius. This is most assuredly a novel about character, characters in the literary vein of Ahab, obsessed beyond the brink: with stamps, with memory, with ghosts, with stories, with notoriety. And that transcends history, it transcends the narrative threads in the novel, it transcends human experience. But there is also the structure of the novel, which is explained in the prologue: all story is composed of multiple stories of individuals. Subjectivity is a bitch, and it can be tedious to sift through the multiple narrative threads of real life. And oh, look, the book is structured in the EXACT same way! What is contemporary folklore and mythology? How has it transformed since 2001 (or 1996 in the timeline of the novel)? It would be interesting to see where J. is at today. In terms of tone, what everyone is dismissing as Whitehead being ever-clever here is really very simple: there is a racial tet-a-tet in the South that must be rendered in irony so that one doesn't just give up altogether. To dismiss the humor as too smart means there are some really stupid readers reading this book.I want my authors to challenge me to the edge, like the characters in this novel get pushed to the edge. How else does one work through the mental/ historical chains to self-actualization?"}, {"userName": "Wes Freeman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/619930-wes-freeman", "userReview": "Some shit to make you quit your job. Every possible look at John Henry's race against a steam drill as model for modern work ethic (modern, at least, circa-late 1990s, early 2000s, before economy receded). For those out there who aren't happy to have a job, who are still asking why am I doing this pointless thing every day just for $, step between these pages and take a load off. Author feels you. He feels heaps other stuff, too; book is chock full of Eustachian tube-clearing funny jokes and spot-on descriptions of airport->hotel->airport->hotel malaise. Lest this start to sound like Office Space: The Novel, should point out book has a warning: You are John Henry, pop culture is steam drill, race is on. Central question of book is whether or not John Henry really won his race, cuz, you know, he died. Author handles many threads at once, one of which is that John Henry, through song has become a pop icon. This dark and ironic thread joins others, author makes good rope, end of the book is a noose."}, {"userName": "Roy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811952-roy", "userReview": "John Henry Days is written in an interesting narrative style. It shows us events through the lens of multiple characters, some repeatedly visited, others glimpsed just once or twice. A man named J. Sutter is the one most frequently observed, so I suppose he is technically the main character. But the true MC is a particular weekend in a particular town where an event possibly took place many years earlier, featuring a person who possibly existed. The event was a man defeating a machine at the feat of drilling a tunnel through mountain to allow the continuation of train tracks. The man of course, is John Henry. He is the stuff of legend regardless of whether he was ever one of flesh and blood, so a stamp has been created to commemorate him and a festival is taking place to mark the occasion. Colson Whitehead approaches this weekend from a wide variety of angles. Among the people involved in the build-up is a man researching the origins of a song written about John Henry, a man who collects railroad stamps, a woman who owns a hotel in the town where the festival is taking place, a man so obsessed with John Henry that he turned his home into a museum dedicated to him, that man's daughter, a journalist covering the events of the weekend, and John Henry himself. Hints are given throughout the book that just as the famous race ended in foretold tragedy, so will the commemoration. Whitehead has a beautiful way with words. If you're looking for a character driven novel where you'll deeply identify with and care for the protagonist, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a traditional beginning, middle, end style story rather than one which jumps back and forth in time and place, go find another book. But if you're interested in a distinctive approach to examination of a symbolic event, one that will be timely so long as people either resist, embrace, take advantage of, or become victims to the changes brought about by the march of progress, then I point you in the direction of John Henry Days. John took a last stand for human determination before it was replaced by mindless but more efficient machinery. Win or lose, his effort was in vain. He may as well have been battling death. We can postpone arrival of the Grim Reaper, but inevitably his date of arrival will be reached."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3679784-drew", "userReview": "Damn, to've read this in 2001 when it was fresh, when Colson Whitehead was just the weird dude who wrote about the elevator inspectors. We've all experienced the greatness of his work since then, all the way to the culmination of everything that came before in The Underground Railroad, and so it's a little obvious to say that this book is, like pretty much all of his work, astounding. But this book is dense, it is confounding, it leads you down paths that it doesn't explain. And the ending, of course, leaves you asking the same question that people have been asking about John Henry the whole time: how much of it was true? Did he die then, did he die later? In 2001, I might've thought the book overly ambitious and a little flawed in its execution; but in 2018, knowing what happens next (for Whitehead, for the country), it's hard not to say \"god, he was this good that early?\""}, {"userName": "Deb Oestreicher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5895541-deb-oestreicher", "userReview": "I confess to being awed by Colson Whitehead. This novel is just astonishing. I am pretty sure my mouth dropped open at several points. A sort of fantasia around the fictional release of a commemorative stamp honoring the folk hero John Henry, the book convincingly imagines a wide range of American lives--all the people associated with the festivities planned to launch the new stamp, including journalists, publicists, a small town's officials and citizens, assorted guests (such as a stamp collector and the daughter of a collector of John Henry-ana), and John Henry himself.The book is full of really terrific writing: some of it satire, some of it straight-out storytelling, and some of it jaw-droppingly beautiful. I'm especially fond of a short section set at a fair, in which we observe individuals in the crowd from the inside as well as the outside (as though we're passing angels, as in Wings of Desire).Look forward to reading more of his work."}, {"userName": "Ruthiella", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3082480-ruthiella", "userReview": "It is pretty clear to me from this book that Whitehead is a versatile and ambitious writer. I really liked the Delillo-like riffs on simulacra and modern malaise, the Doctorow-like ability to time travel to a historical era and the Kunzru-like (only Whitehead did it here first) dive in to African American cultural appropriation. The book uses the fictional launch of a John Henry commemorative stamp (to be part of a set that will include other American folkloric heroes Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill and Casey at the Bat) as its inspiration and the main character is J. Sutter, a \u201cjunketeer\u201d which is sort of a professional grifter-journalist who goes from movie opening to product launch, allegedly to write it up for some news outlet but really for the open bar and free lunch and the expense account, which he inflates by fishing for abandoned receipts to claim for reimbursement. The book moves from satire to absurdity to passages so moving it was hard not to cry. There is also a black cloud of the threat of violence hovering over the entire novel, for example when a black man feels perfectly fine standing in line to buy beer with crack-heads and drug dealers at 2:00 AM in Brooklyn in one section but is later worried about his wellbeing in broad daylight in small town West Virginia. But for all its brilliance, there was a lot of writing in here that tends to annoy me and pull me out, such as, \u201cThe smoke lights out into the dark lands and swirls away by forces into diasporic scattering.\u201d or \u201c\u2026that block where street lights stare blindly, handicapped by vandalism and city neglect, where shadows confab to trade samizdat decrying illumination.\u201d.

Of course, \"The Intuitionist\" and \"Apex Hides the Hurt\" were so brilliant that most novels are weaker than them. \"John Henry\" also suffers from sophomore over-reaching; Whitehead is clever to the point of genius. but that is actually the books failing, as it is often clever without restraint. The lines \"So much depends upon a red pickup truck, filled with crackers,\" and \"a runway model dares to eat a peach\" both made me laugh at their cleverness, but it was a hollow laughter, as they served no purpose other than act as a knowing wink between over-educated author and over-educated reader. Luckily, such post-modern excess were rare, and most of the book was enjoyable and bitting. It was a bit too much like vintage DeLillo (who I love, but not when reading Whitehead), but still great. Not for people who bridle at DeLillo's identical characters opining in identically clever voices, but like \"White Noise,\" you don't read :John Henry\" for character, but for ideas and a scathing look at contemporary American Society,"}, {"userName": "First Second Books", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3181817-first-second-books", "userReview": "This one has been on my shelf for a few years--I read Sag Harbor, The Intuitionist, Apex Hides the Hurt, and Zone One multiple times so obviously I'm a huge Whitehead fan, but for some reason John Henry Days slipped through the cracks. I'm glad it did, because it gave me a new Whitehead book to read while I waited for The Underground Railroad to come out. It didn't disappoint. I usually have extremely limited tolerance for books that jump POV as much as this one does -- they more often than not feel like creative writing assignments or formal exercises more than coherent narratives, but Whitehead (of course) pulls it off perfectly."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/850644-jane", "userReview": "Although I'd rate Whitehead's more recent Sag Harbor higher for pure enjoyment, this one places near the top on the admiration scale.

In \"John Henry Days\" we have a local story (Talcott is just 20 miles down river from me), a WV tale, and one of the finest and most accessible Postmodernist novels ever written. I have been reading and rereading the novel for a while now and it has been an immense pleasure each time. It is a work of tremendous detail on human existence. Like all great Postmodernist novels it is an unrepentant criticism of Late Capitalism and its commodization of the human spirit. Utilizing the history of the John Henry legend Whitehead offers a critical analysis of capitalism's exploitation of labor from the Gilded Age of the 19th century to the fin de siecle of the 20th century. While the author does maintain a subplot of the issue of race in economics, the main focus is exploitation of the arts and its role in a free market. He traces this from the early period of musical commodification of sheet music to records to Broadway plays and the same with the field of writing in the realm of publicity and marketing with the rise of the Internet. Colson also injects the concept of perspective as a multiplicity. John Henry is seen through the eyes of the locals, the Washingtonian bureaucracy, the New York marketing apparachiks, and the American mythos. This faceted gaze is also turned to West Virginia and its own place in our nation's collective conscience:\"These little telling details.\"\"And you see those dents on the statue? People come around and use it for target practice. One time they chained the statue to a pickup and dragged it off the pedestal down the road here. Then the statue fell off and they drove off so they found it next day just lying in the road.\"\"Probably not much to do here on a Saturday night.\"\"Hmm.\"What does this short conversation between the two principal African American characters tell us about the history of race in our country and the echos of Southern lynchings it creates in our minds? Or is Whitehead reminding us that we are all just objects of entertainment, objects of utility? Are we all just doomed to die \"with a hammer in our hands\"?Unlike the novel, John Henry Days is a real event held at Talcott in Summers County WV each year on the second weekend in July. It is as wholesome a piece of Americana as Colson portrays it in his prose.

The story of John Henry as song, as legend, as tourist attraction is the narrative thread. The focus is on John Henry Days, a festival in West Virginia that has been created to celebrate John Henry and the issuing of a stamp of him, but more importantly to bring tourists to two small and economically struggling towns. Much of the story is through the eyes of J. Sutter, a black journalist and junketeer, whose visit to the festival has been paid for so that he can write about it. He and the other junketeers attend many of the same events throughout the country, writing about events large and small for web sites, magazines, newspapers, and trade organizations, even though they are jaded about the process and the things they write about. The best parts of the novel are the multiple points of view that span the last hundred years or so, from John Henry to a song plugger to a man whose life has been consumed by collecting John Henry memorabilia to a stamp collector whose focus is on railroad stamps. J. Sutter is going for a record on junkets that he's writing about, but his interest is pulled away by the daughter of the John Henry collector, who has resented her father and what his mania for collecting did to him. I would have liked less on the junketeers since they're an annoying and good old boys bunch for the most part. Whitehead's writing reminds me a little of Thomas Pynchon, David Wallace, and David Bradley, which is a pretty good recommendation."}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "I DNF at 21 percent. I tried to finish this book, but honestly nothing was grabbing me at all. Initially, I was intrigued about how Whitehead would weave in John Henry into the story, but instead we seem to be flip flopping between different narrative styles. I really loved \"Underground Railroad\" and was hoping for more of the same here, but this book really needed some magical realism or something like the former book to really make it stand out.\"John Henry Days\" takes a look at folk hero John Henry and an African American journalist (called J) who is flying into the town that claims him to write about the John Henry Days celebration. Whitehead goes back and forth between J and just random characters in this book. I think this is his way of taking a look at race in America. I just couldn't force myself to keep reading this. I didn't care one whit about J the only character that I think that we follow through this whole book. I found the writing to be uneven. There were way too many metaphors. The chapters were really short too which doesn't allow you enough time to get settled into whatever POV you are currently in while reading."}, {"userName": "Daniel Petersen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11447268-daniel-petersen", "userReview": "This is my first Colson Whitehead book and I liked it quite a bit. It is a patchwork novel, narrating characters and events from a range of times and places in American history: late 19th century as well as early, mid, and late 20th century - not in that order! These narratives loop backward and forward round one another, but not to the point of incoherence. Several of the set pieces are just exquisite, some of the best stuff I've ever read. By far the most gripping for me was a (fictional) eyewitness account of the 1969 Rolling Stones/Hell's Angels debacle in the desert. It is horrifically fascinating (and told in the dazzlingly authentic voice of an old white rock journalist). If it surprises you that such an account would find itself in the midst of a novel ostensibly about the legend of John Henry and the history of the railroads of America, then it gives you an indication of the unexpected turns this novel takes. You will indeed encounter very richly rendered passages on John Henry himself working away at his legendary steel-driving as a member of the work crews making railroad tunnels through America's mountains. You will also see 'temp' workers in an office helping create search engine content for the very latest (1996) in internet technology. You'll be a hack journalist in a convenience store queue in the middle of the night with junkies in modern (1990s) Brooklyn one chapter, a 1950s blues singer on the make in Chicago in another, a middle class ten-year-old black girl in late 1940s Harlem in yet another, and have a modern press pass to a phantasmagoric-dystopic book launch in still another. There are one or two moments of suspense or violence, a few moments of eeriness or horror, lots of chuckles and some outright laughs. There are tons of wry observations and insights about the contemporary grotesque-yet-bland circus of pop culture and media and technology. (Wonderful refrains are scattered throughout about the 'plodding obeisance of pop', 'He had been devoured by pop', 'deep into cold pop', 'life under pop', etc.) There is poignancy and there is dystopia. It is about ecology as much as culture. Indeed, you could perhaps call it the story of 'Pop vs. The Mountain'.(I know you will be few, but if any of you are R. A. Lafferty fans like I am, you'll perhaps be as surprised and delighted as I was to find some very interesting resonances between the two otherwise disparate authors.)The book suffers from its form. It is hard to be impelled by any one narrative thread. There is a (shiftless but very likeable) main character and his is the main story of the novel, but he can be off stage for long swathes of narration. At times the pages fly by but at others they grind to a halt. There is always some reward in moving forward, some new set piece you wouldn't have guessed and for which you are very glad you kept going. But it is a long, sprawling, high-minded 'great American novel' (if bitingly ironic in its high-mindedness).The latent (and sometimes blatant) prejudice toward many white and 'country' people from an NYC perspective was off-putting at times, if understandable. But there was, at least, an honesty to the narrative that often admitted it was big city paranoia toward the rest of the country. (A neglected theme that could use its own novel-length treatments.)It is also a very philosophically bleak novel. There are certain versions of this kind of bleakness that for some reason I can totally take to (e.g. Cormac McCarthy), but in this novel I found it bordering on depressing for me personally. It is mostly quite deeply cynical. (Not in the sense of having no sympathy for characters, but rather in the sense of seeming to 'see through' just about *everything*, bordering on nihilism. Some, I know, find such a worldview bracing. I find it untrue.) Still, I can relate to the novel's world-weary vision. Considering its pessimism, it is actually remarkable that it stays true to the instinctual yearning to find a scrap of meaning or value or goodness, mostly failing but maybe showing a glimmer of hope in the end. It is a search for authenticity in a world of slick, sick fakery and I salute the author for turning away in disgust from so much of contemporary American culture.I am definitely very excited to go on to read the rest of Colson Whitehead's novels."}, {"userName": "Chris Chester", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2660837-chris-chester", "userReview": "By some strange chance, I happened to pick this book up when I came upon it in a used bookstore in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. I had never been to West Virginia before, nor can I recall having read a book set there (Deliverance was further south, right?), so it seemed serendipitous perhaps to purchase a book set in the state while briefly setting foot there.But I digress.John Henry Days is not at all what I thought it would be, but is actually not too out there, once I really think about it. After all the varied and multifaceted legend of John Henry can be adapted to suit just about any purpose. It's a story of man's triumph and fall in the face of progress. It's a story about manifest destiny and conquering the American continent. Or the working man besting bourgy businessman and his contrivances.So the possibilities are really endless.And rather than picking just one lens to examine the John Henry legend, Whitehead seems to have decided to tell them all at once, in a series of vignettes that span the country, time and the meta-narrative.At it's core, John Henry Days feels like an attack on the notion of work. Or if not an attack, then a sympathetic lament. There are a host of characters that writhe under their unfulfilled potential. The main character J. striving in the self-consciously meaningless world of junketeering. A jazz musician selling his best work on a lark for $50. A black power pioneer who shuffles from a college podium And John Henry himself, killing himself and others so that C&O can building a railroad through a mountain instead of around it.Indeed, the only character in the whole book who doesn't seem to squirm around with a hole in his core is the polished PR Manager, a profession that I guess encourages one to embrace the darkness and hold it close.His prose is at first whip-smart and incisive in an almost Woody Allenish way, but as it chugs along towards the conclusion, it begins to unwind and begins to lazily thrash at caricatures and stereotypes in a way that disrupts the narrative before coming together at the end.I guess the question I find myself asking after just finishing the book is... do I buy the premise that modern man -- in fealty to the new media that is \"welfare for middle class white people\" as I think Whitehead puts it -- is his struggle, sacrifices and failure the same as John Henry's? Is the post-modern attempt to chisel a life out of a mountain of irony as noble and doomed as John Henry's?I still don't know, but I do enjoy the conversation."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870152-john", "userReview": "I read this book mostly because it had the words \"John Henry\" in the title.

And as the book's fractured narrative hopped around with one main plotline, the John Henry Days of the title, a celebration in Talcott, WV of the man, and several other side plots, I began to believe that Melville's whale was indeed the inspiration. The main plot follows J. Sutter, freelance journalist, as he goes to Talcott to write a website article on the festival and the post office commemorative stamp of the fabled hero. From there, the story branches out to others who have touched or been touched by the John Henry legend, even including John Henry himself. People singing the song, the musicians who've played it, a collector of John Henry memorabilia and his daughter. It's a kaleidoscopic effect and every section is filled with Whitehead's pungent wit. Of note, two things happened simultaneous with reading the novel. At one point, because it's a grand American tradition, there's a random mass shooting at Talcott at the festival, which was contemporaneous with Parkland, Florida. The other, less stark, is when the freelance writers are talking, they categorize the kinds of puff pieces they write.There is Bob's Debut, the piece about Bob, the Archetypal celebrity who is suddenly everywhere.There is Bob's Return, the sophomore album, the next big movie made by Bob after his initial appearance. Then at last there is Bob's Comeback. Whitehead writes about this as such:\u201cBob\u2019s Comeback is miraculous. It can occur two years after the doomed or mediocre Return, or twenty years. Many things could have happened in the intervening time to make Bob\u2019s Comeback printworthy: five crafty but overlooked novels consigned him to the twilight of midlist; three big-budget flops, two straight to video movies, one sitcom and a couple softcore thrillers fit only for the dingier cable outlets made a character actor of Bob; five very strange albums anointed Bob a critics\u2019 darling but a radio pariah. The long unchecked skid into obscurity. But then the comeback. A day after reading this passage, suddenly making the rounds on Twitter, amidst the teens crushing Marco Rubio's public display of his essence being nothing more than a stack of spineless quivering NRA dollar bills, was the tender story on GQ titled \"Whatever Happened to Brendan Fraser?\" (https://www.gq.com/story/what-ever-ha...).Bob's Comeback, at the very moment of reading about it. made a character actor of Bob is exactly the story going on in the GQ piece.Truly, Whitehead's finger is always exactly on the softer pulse of Americana."}, {"userName": "Johnny", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3784000-johnny", "userReview": "Ik kende John Henry van de Disney-film \"Tall Tale\", waar hij samen met Paul Bunyan en Pecos Bill een fantasierijk jongetje helpt de boerderij van zijn vader te redden. John Henry is een mythologische figuur uit de Amerikaanse geschiedenis. Een sterke spoorwegarbeider die ooit een wedstrijd tegen een stoomdrilboor won. Toen ik tijdens de boekenverkoop van de bibliotheek in Genk een exemplaar van \"De John Henry Dagen\" zag liggen, geschreven door Colson Whitehead - tegenwoordig bekend van zijn laatste boek \"De Ondergrondse Spoorweg\" - moest ik het wel meenemen zodat ik over de details van deze legende kon lezen. Details bevat het boek in ieder geval, maar spijtig genoeg niet alleen over John Henry. Een gedetailleerd verslag van een concert van de Rolling Stones, een complete uitleg over de procedure om een vuurwapen te kopen, een uiteenzetting over gloeilampen ... Het verhaal speelt zich af in de moderne tijd en volgt verschillende personages die eigenlijk op zoek gaan naar de waarheid achter John Henry, en ondertussen ook van zichzelf een legende proberen te maken, iemand die de mensen zich nog jaren blijven herinneren en waarvan de verhalen misschien ook een eigen leven gaan leiden. Whitehead vertelt heel veel in zijn boek, hij geeft veel informatie, maar hij laat weinig zien, wat het boek heel saai maakt, maar John Henry zelf komt eigenlijk heel weinig aan bod. Pas op pagina 222 ontdekte ik het eerste hoofdstuk dat me aansprak: een dialoog tussen twee personages, gestructureerd als een filmscript, maar met telkens tussen haakjes een metaforische omschrijving van wat er of op welke manier het gezegd wordt. Maar dat was snel voorbij. Doorheen het boek zijn er verwijzingen dat er iets staat te gebeuren, en het duurt echt tot het einde voor het effectief gebeurt. Nu ja, de gebeurtenis zelf wordt overgeslagen. Je krijgt wel een andere dialoog waar twee mensen over het voorval praten. Daarna volgen weer een aantal sc\u00e8nes die zich voor het incident afspelen. Maar je hebt wel goed door hoe het verhaal voor de personages eindigt. Ook het verhaal van John Henry zelf stopt voor hij de wedstrijd aangaat. Whitehead geeft dus geen enkel antwoord, alsof ook zijn personages mythische figuren zijn wiens verhaal door de overlevering een eigen leven gaat leiden. \"De John Henry Dagen\" is helemaal mijn ding niet, en ik verwacht niet ooit nog niets anders van Whitehead te lezen."}, {"userName": "Tomas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2059111-tomas", "userReview": "Wow. What a great book. Whitehead takes a folk tale -- that of black steel driver John Henry -- and brings it to a life that spans the beginning of the age of the railroad to the 1990's. It's not because John Henry lived that long. Actually, Henry died quite young since winning a steel-driving contest with a machine cost him his life. Whitehead does it by bringing to light the life of various characters whose lives intersect somehow with the folk hero. There is J. Sutter, the hack who is sent on a junket to cover the inauguration of the \"John Henry Days\" in the Midwest town that has laid claim to being the birthplace of John Henry. There is Pamela, the daughter of a man who spent his life collecting John Henry memorabilia and ran a museum dedicated to the railroad worker out of his apartment which no one ever visited. There is the stamp collector whose crowning jewel is a stamp of John Henry and who, inexplicably, begins shooting his gun at a John Henry Days event and is shot down by police. There is, of course, John Henry himself toiling on the West-ward railroad alongside many other poor men of that era. The novel is not written linearly or chronologically. We don't start at the beginning of John Henry's life and end at the closing of John Henry Days. Instead, in each chapter, Whitehead narrates a different slice of the American tale of John Henry from the perspective of a different character. While at times this device can be slightly disorienting it also keeps the novel alive -- saving it from a plodding linear narration. I am edified by the reading of this novel. I had never heard of John Henry. Now his name, story, and legend are meaningful to me. His life is American and modern history. He represents the generations who died to bring humanity the railroad. His death -- in competition with a steam machine to drive steel -- is a sacrifice to \"progress.\" Whitehead's writing style is mesmerizing and entirely original. His descriptions seems to defy the laws of narrative gravity.By the end of the novel J. Sutter has gotten his story but it's not one that he was expecting. It's not the fluff that, as a regular junketeer, he's hired to write. He's found something much more meaningful and he must choose between which story he will bring to the light and what life he will live from then on."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12182557-karen", "userReview": "Every possible angle on the story/myth of John Henry, set in a small town in West Virginia with a claim to be the site of the famous race between John Henry and the steam drill. The town is hoping to give itself a boost by putting on an annual John Henry Days festival, and for the first annual celebration they have gotten the USPS to unveil a John Henry stamp. J., a black journalist from New York, has come down to attend the festivities and possibly write about it. A host of other characters come and go through the book, with references to past scholars who attempted to find out whether John Henry was real, the origins of the Ballad of John Henry, a little boy who steals a steel driving hammer out of an exhibit, and a shopkeeper who collects John Henry memorabilia and turns his home into a museum. It's a marvelous book about myth and pop culture."}, {"userName": "Jesus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5950969-jesus", "userReview": "It's remarkable how a novel can feel deeply rich with meaning, yet leaves one struggling to articulate its meaning or meanings. Partly this is due to Whitehead's prose; he paints with words like an exuberant painter with a hundred tubes of paint and a dozen new brushes. Some chapters are joyous to read for the language and images alone. And the chatacters! Simultaneously familiar and exotic, the delightful assemblage of personalities keeps you engaged. The disjointed narrative makes for less of a tapestry than a tumbling kaleidoscope of changing patterns. The story itself is multilayered and complex, and I suspect it will haunt me like the ghost that haunts the rooms of the Talcott Motor Lodge."}, {"userName": "Carl Williams", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3191565-carl-williams", "userReview": "\u201cThe sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers ride their father's magic carpet made of steel.\" Arlo GutherieHistory or legend, myth or fact\u2014the truth can lie in any of these creations or, equally hide away from any.

Often funny, especially in dialogue, but for the most part the book was a unique journey for me. While I enjoyed the various POVs in the novel, sometimes I felt one came off stronger, clearer, than others. Maybe that's deliberate, or it could just be my varying stress level. At any rate, this is my first experience reading Whitehead, and certainly wont be the last. I find this book very well thought out and articulated, and brings more to the conversation of American history and folklore."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/681586-audrey", "userReview": "Maybe I didn't enjoy this book because Underground was so good.... I just never got in the swing of the ultra short chapter and switching narration. He jumped from present day (which felt dusty given the 90s(?) setting) to John Henry to times in between. There were glimmers that I really appreciated, like talking shortly about how the song developed differently depending on geographical regions. But overall, I wouldn't recommend, whereas I've told multiple people about his most recent book."}], "description": "Colson Whitehead\u2019s eagerly awaited and triumphantly acclaimed new novel is on one level a multifaceted retelling of the story of John Henry, the black steel-driver who died outracing a machine designed to replace him. On another level it\u2019s the story of a disaffected, middle-aged black journalist on a mission to set a record for junketeering who attends the annual John Henry Days festival. It is also a high-velocity thrill ride through the tunnel where American legend gives way to American pop culture, replete with p. r. flacks, stamp collectors, blues men , and turn-of-the-century song pluggers. John Henry Days is an acrobatic, intellectually dazzling, and laugh-out-loud funny book that will be read and talked about for years to come.", "title": "John Henry Days", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16276.John_Henry_Days", "average": 3.65, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388219049l/16276.jpg", "reviews": 172, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10029.Colson_Whitehead", "name": "Colson Whitehead"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural", "Novels", "Abandoned"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16276.John_Henry_Days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/966664.John_Henry_Days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9167484-john-henry-days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7841555-john-henry-days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30555488-the-underground-railroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10365343-zone-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16271.The_Intuitionist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4428988-sag-harbor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259065.Apex_Hides_the_Hurt"]}
