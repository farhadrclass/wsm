It proved to be excellent and after a while I got used to the layout and the different ways in which the narrative is communicated. When I read a fiction, after a while I see pictures in my head and become unaware of the words. So it was in this case.\tThe heroine is a sentient AI (artificial intelligence/android/robot) called Ava who is played in the actual film by Alicia Vikander (who had the role of Alice in the film adaptation of \u2018The Spook\u2019s Apprentice\u2019). \tA young man is brought into contact with her, perhaps to test her. Is she truly sentient or is it that her coding only makes her seem that way? Is she dangerous? Is she attractive? \tThere are many twists and turns in the plot and, although grounded in a genre where many of the plot features might have be done before, it still comes across as fresh and compelling. I really enjoyed it.\tI am interested in androids at the moment because combat androids feature in my new series \u2018Arena 13\u2019. If that ever gets turned into a film, I\u2019d like Alex Garland to direct it."}, {"userName": "Sabrina Grafenberger", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21527693-sabrina-grafenberger", "userReview": "I had to read the script after watching the film, because Ex Machina is a brilliant, smart, gripping and thought provoking movie with great actors. The screenplay didn't disappoint. Although it's almost identical to the film, it clarifies some things and gives a bit more insight into some scenes.I'd recommend watching the movie rather than reading the script (it is one of my favorite films of all time). But if you want additional information for a better understanding or if you just love screenplays - go for it."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27824261-michelle", "userReview": "Just as good as the movie."}, {"userName": "Alastair", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14125450-alastair", "userReview": "Something magic just happened. A couple of magical things, in fact, and one quite honestly life-altering. Before we go there, please humour me: my name is Alastair and I love to study sceenplays recreationally.It\u2019s a dorky indulgence. It\u2019s part of who I am. And every time I secretly yearn for some huge epiphany that will instantly make me a better writer: a sudden flash in which I can see and understand a film exactly as the author did; to feel myself in their place, staring down at their imaginary anachronistic typewriter, phantom aftertaste of morning whisky still lingering.I\u2019d call it a silly dream - understanding coming so much more from persistent work and time - had such a blazing moment of clarity not just happened.Alex Garland\u2019s script to Ex Machina (a beautifully sharp and thoughtful movie well worth your time - have I mentioned that bit yet?) lays his every thought process bare. His sense of suspense, economy and shot-by-shot pacing, and especially his visual inventiveness, were all right there on the page from the start. We see not only what he imagined, but - vitally - WHY.It\u2019s masterclass in hyperfocussed screenwriting unlike any other I\u2019ve enjoyed, and besides that, just a riveting read - a script striking not only in its similarity to the finished product, but in the many little moments cut for even tighter storytelling.And on a personal level... something truly special followed.This feeling of inspiration - of seeing a skilled craftsperson\u2019s overwhelming sense of purpose - made something else click.I suddenly started processing my own ideas differently. More seriously. Concepts slowly gestating for years solidified. Unconnected ideas snapped together with an almost violent magnetic force. I knew not only what story I wanted to write, but why.I began work on a novel that night. A hypothetical dream project that had felt slippery and abstract my whole adult life, seemingly lying in wait of that one epiphany to give it shape. A story almost comically unrelated to Ex Machina in tone and genre and medium and quality and everything else besides, but nonetheless owing so much to one wonderful script. And one dorky desire, now validated, to understand a well-made piece of fiction a little more.Whatever the outcome, I\u2019ll still know myself so much better than I did this morning.Your mileage may vary! If you enjoyed the movie, maybe give it a go?"}, {"userName": "Ashlinn Craven", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25221224-ashlinn-craven", "userReview": "I'm an Alex Garland nut, he's been in my top 5 authors list since The Beach. And with AI being one of my specialty topics, my expectations were skyrocketing as I downloaded this screenplay and let's just say there was some risk of anticlimax. But I'm happy to say, with Ex Machina, Garland has excelled once again. With surprisingly few words he paints a compelling and unsettling picture of how early AI might infiltrate our world and our system of ethics. Handling of the academic points is light, accurate and blissfully original--the tired old Turning test gets a makeover here. Garland has that happy skill of looking at familiar concepts from a new, oblique angle. the screenplay can be read on several levels: romance/noir/techno-thriller/dystopian and it should appeal to a broad audience. I wouldn't be surprised if it became another cult classic. The ending is perfect."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3113943-aaron", "userReview": "Exactly what I would expect from the author of 28 days later. It was quick paced, action packed, believable and very dark. Since the zombie apocalypse phase has passed the Artificial Intelligence uprising seems to be the current zeitgeist. With folks like Stephen Hawking supporting the fear and our military trend towards unmanned artillery it would appear to be the logical progression. No matter what form the apocalypse comes in I feel I will be well prepared. At least after a few dozen more AI apocalypse novels that is."}, {"userName": "Mariah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63807287-mariah", "userReview": "This is actually the first time I have every read a screen play, but I love this movie and wondered what it was originally written like. While the movie is amazing the screen play gives us a little more explanation and understanding of the character Ava. And even Kyoko, though it is not much. In short the screen play answered some of the questions the movie left me with. I, for instance was never sure of Ava and Kyoko's communication with both everyone else and with each other. But the screen play shows us how Ava hears and how she sees which is far different than what I assumed. Instead of her hearing and seeing the way we do, she seems to process in sound pitches and expressions the same way the movie showed Caleb in the beginning. Which for the first time makes her feel more robotic than ever in the film, even though for most of her screen time she is seen with all of her robotics just on full display. And on the other hand there is Kyoko. We learn next to nothing about her in the movie, but in the screen play we learn that she was just like the other AI's at first but when Nathan striped her subroutines he decided to keep her body and make her unable to communicate. But we learn that she not only has been watching and absorbing what has been going on throughout the film but that she can still communicate with Ava. Its not explained how Ava understands her but it is shown in the movie that Kyoko opens her mouth to Ava's ear and a sort of static sound comes out. From this I came to the conclusion that Ava understood Kyoko from the fact that she interrupts things the same way a computer does and therefore did not need words to communicate with another AI. And the only thing that still surprises me about the story in whole is that Ava seems to not know kyoko because there is a scene that she sees her and says \"who are you\" I assume this is because Nathan did not want them to meet, maybe he knew that they could communicate in a way that he would not understand and therefore he kept them apart? But its Kyoko that seems to at least partially orchestrate the escape with Ava. Is it communicated between them that she wanted to kill Nathan? Did Ava promise her an escape if she helped? Did she know that in helping Ava she would be killed? Was the blue fluid that seeped out of her head wound the wetware that we learn their brains are made of? Could she have been repaired if Nathan somehow survived? And when Ava took the skin from the Jade body, why did jade look up at her? Was she still charged? What use would Nathan Have to have her charged if she no longer functioned? Was the same thing done to her that was done to Kyoko? If so, was Nathan using all of his past AI's as sex robots like he was planning to do with Ava? And what of Caleb? In the end after he sees Ava fly away in the helicopter he goes to the computer and types in a line of code that when executed would have spelled out \"Goodbye world\" does that mean he thinks hes gonna die in there? He was left in the room with Nathan's workout weights couldn't he at least attempt to escape? If he could stack things to the ceiling could he get to the window he was looking through when he saw the plane fly away? Though I am left with many questions, I still see this as a great movie and great screenplay!"}, {"userName": "Will Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2820455-will-johnson", "userReview": "The film is a masterclass of science-fiction/social commentary so reading the screenplay, while already being privy to the twists, made me appreciate the skill of Alex Garland. He wrote compelling dialogue and knew how to see his vision through as the director. While a brilliant, Academy Award nominated screenplay, reading a script without the visuals can sometimes be less exciting (it IS a visual medium) but Garland creates something vivid and thought provoking."}, {"userName": "Nick Coleman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22793548-nick-coleman", "userReview": "Love this movie, as well as everything else Alex Garland's touched. This is the first screenplay of his I've read and I love the sparse, evocative style. As a writer/director myself, I find it most helpful to read screenplays of other writer/directors, because it feels like more of a one-to-one experience than reading a screenplay that was reordered, restructured, and so on, by a director making his mark on someone else's script (usually for the better)."}, {"userName": "Lily", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23638287-lily", "userReview": "An extremely well written screenplay, it was enjoyable to have one of my favourite movies unfold in a written form."}, {"userName": "Alexander Kowalak", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33592492-alexander-kowalak", "userReview": "Die ganze Geschichte ist ein einziger Turing Test.
