When this book begins, two men and trying to bring back the body of a third using their dog sled team. There has been a lack of food and night by night one of their dogs go missing. Finally, they see the culprit - a she wolf who is luring their dogs away. Food is scarce, and she is part of a wolf pack trying to survive. Soon the men are being hunted by the wolves and it becomes a battle to survive. Besides She-Wolf (half dog half wolf), an older wolf called one eye is with the pack. Eventually they mate, and White Fang becomes their surviving pup.Initially life is good for White Fang. He is inquisitive and lets his instincts help him learn to explore and hunt. But one day he and his Mother come across men \"Gods\" and their lives change. Soon Mother and Pup are separated, and White Fang gets his introductions into the harsh realities of life. He learns the pains of separation, the pains of beatings and the pains of not fitting in with the other dogs and wolves. White Fang is sold and has an even more sadistic owner who turns him into a fighter. Eventually White Fang is saved and begins a new life where he eventually knows kindness and trust. He becomes part of a family again.So now that I have told you the plot of the entire book, I will tell you that I really enjoyed this story. I liked how the story is mainly told through White Fang's POV. It gives the reader a great look at White Fang's impulses, instincts, personality, fears and thoughts. Well written and with a sweet ending. London captured the environment and elements brilliantly. I love when I read a book and feel as if I am right there during the action. I'm glad that I selected to read this as part of a group read.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Henry Avila", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5431458-henry-avila", "userReview": "Can an animal part wolf, part dog, be rehabilitated and become a domestic pet? The exact opposite of, another Jack London novel, The Call of the Wild. So the premise is, in White Fang. A runaway former Indian bred she- wolf, Kiche, along with forty odd others, in a wolf pack, are following three men on a dog sled, two still alive. Famine grips the territory in the Yukon, during the Klondike Gold Rush, Canada, just before the start of the Twentieth Century . The wild animals are starving, literally they're just skin and bones . Bill and Henry need to get to civilization quickly before the wolves have dinner. A dead man is on the sled, in a coffin (some kind of British nobleman, name never given), why such a person is here, the two live ones can't figure out, and never asked. Their job is to take him to a little remote town... (Strange goings on), Bill feeds the seven dogs with fish, at camp, but Henry tells his partner they have only six. Fires ring the fugitives from the law, of the survival of the fittest, the higher the flames arise, the better, how long the wood will last, is something the men don't want to think about. A dog disappears in the bitter cold , horrific night, at another stop another and , well you get the picture , no more dogs, or bullets. One gentleman is left, the hungry wolves come in....The wolf pack breaks up into smaller and smaller groups, the famine ends. Kiche the she-wolf, with some dog blood, takes a mate, One-Eye, an older animal. A litter of five, are born by the Mackenzie River, but only one cub, later named White Fang, reaches maturity. In the future, a vicious ninety pounds of anger, kill before they kill you is his way. He learned it early, to live is the only important thing. All else doesn't matter, nature is cruel, the brave, the strong prosper, the weak, fall down and stay down. Grey Beaver captures the cub, his late brother had owned his mother, Kiche, so he claims him as his. The tribe agrees, and takes him to the Indian village, later sells the valuable grown up wolfdog, to Beauty Smith (who brought the liquor bottles), while drunk, an alias that the white man doesn't deserve, not by a long shot, he is the ugliest man around. The beatings that White Fang received, from Grey Beaver, is increased greatly by Smith, he likes punishing the animal, it makes him feel brave and he is the biggest coward in Fort Yukon. His new owner has contests, dog fights, inside a cage, the crowd of men cheer on wildly,( humans, the real beasts), bet on their favorites, during the carnage, with any opponent fool enough to challenge White Fang . Turning the already brutal wolfdog, into a smart, perfect, killing machine. Until Weedon Scott, arrives, a kind man with political influence. The question, will Scott rescue the unloved wolfdog, who has never known gentleness from people, just whippings, and the club, on the head, or a kick to the body, get the salvation he desperately needs ? Probably Jack London's best book."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "White Fang, Jack London\u2019s 1906 companion (and thematic mirror) story to his classic The Call of the Wild begins with an archetypal London setting, a scene of desperate survival in a harsh, cruel environment. Following the growth of a hybrid wolf-dog as he grows and fights and survives in the frozen north, White Fang embodies and demonstrates many of the common themes of London\u2019s work such as survival of the fittest, isolation from society, and a primitive naturalism. In the spirit of Joseph Conrad and Algernon Blackwood, London subtly personifies \u201cthe wild\u201d until it is as much a character as one who gets a line of dialogue. Blackwood\u2019s novella The Wendigo is a close companion to White Fang in that the frozen, inhospitable and unforgiving northlands comes to add an antagonistic quality to the narrative. In many ways White Fang, more brutal and less dramatic than Call of the Wild, is the more quintessential London novel, though my pick for best London book is still The Sea Wolf."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "I was reminded of Diana, the Huntress with her lop-eared hounds driving her chariot and her nymphs as her hunting companions when I read this book. And it is as that Goddess that I accompanied the wolf White Fang (the only survivor out of a litter of five puppies), on his incredible journey through life. I was the hidden onlooker basking in all the trials and tribulations that overcame him, be it through periods of famine, extreme brutality by human beings, his necessity and desire to hunt and to kill. Due to all of this he was hated both by man and dog. So having no kindness in his life how could he possibly ever like a person, never mind love him.This isn\u2019t your ordinary wolf with a touch of dog thrown in for good measure, but a very intelligent creature who soon realizes from the time of being a puppy that it\u2019s a question of survival living in this harsh Canadian climate and where you have the choice of being the one who eats or ends up being eaten; it is indeed survival of the fittest. He soon finds out that he doesn\u2019t actually have a choice in the way that he can lead his life. He realizes the power of men, the \u201cgods\u201d as he calls them, and being faced with famine, he quickly realizes what direction his life has to take.Incredible dogs are met such as Lip-lip, Collie, Dick the hound, White Fang\u2019s mother, Kiche, the reddish furred wolf-dog who had violent inclinations, and One-Eye the successful rival out of three fighting to be the object of her attention and desire, and ultimately the father of White Fang:The battle began fairly, but it did not end fairly. There was no telling what the outcome would have been, for the third wolf joined the elder and together, old leader and young leader, they attacked the ambitious three-year old and proceeded to destroy him. He was beset on either side by the merciless fangs of his erstwhile comrades. Forgotten were the days they had hunted together, the game they had pulled down, the famine they had suffered. That business was a thing of the past. The business of love was at hand - even a sterner and crueler business than that of food-getting. And in the meantime, the she-wolf, the cause of it all, sat down contentedly on her haunches and watched. She was even pleased. This was her day \u2013 and it came not often \u2013 when manes bristled, and fang smote fang or ripped and tore the yielding flesh, all for the possession of her.I really loved White Fang, despite whatever he got up to because you as the reader were allowed to enter into his reasoning mind. That was so clever of the author and I often had tears to my eyes in parts and even a lump in my throat. One of those occasions showed White Fang, barking for the first time.And what an incredible mix of individuals who blend in so well within the fabric of this book: The evil ones such as the Indian Gray Beaver, and Beauty Smith, who trained dogs to kill in blood sports versus the good individuals such as Judge Scott, Weedon Scott and his wife Alice and Matt, the dog-musher. I defy anyone who will not be overwhelmed with the brilliance of this book by London. Once I had picked this book up, I could only quickly eat, and couldn\u2019t put it down until I had finished it.Jack London through his magnificent descriptions has embraced life in the northlands during the Yukon Gold rush in the 1890\u2019s and shown such a graphic insight of the savagery of life then, with human beings, especially their violence towards their sled dogs. Nevertheless, he counters this by also demonstrating kindness and loyalty. But this author\u2019s incredible imagination keeps the reader hanging on with enthusiasm regardless of what happens. There was a sensational section with a man bent on revenge, to name but one of the different wonderful sections of this book and in several other cases, the men and women who came to realize the worth ofWhite Fang.In conclusion, this is one of those books that has to be read. As for future reading, I can see myself re-reading it many times in the future as this is an absolutely wonderful read and there\u2019s nothing more to be said!"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "White Fang, Jack London White Fang is a novel by American author Jack London (1876\u20131916) \u2014 and the name of the book's eponymous character, a wild wolfdog. First serialized in Outing magazine, it was published in 1906. The story takes place in Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories, Canada, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush and details White Fang's journey to domestication. It is a companion novel (and a thematic mirror) to London's best-known work, The Call of the Wild, which is about a kidnapped, domesticated dog embracing his wild ancestry to survive and thrive in the wild. Much of White Fang is written from the viewpoint of the titular canine character, enabling London to explore how animals view their world and how they view humans. White Fang examines the violent world of wild animals and the equally violent world of humans. The book also explores complex themes including morality and redemption.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0633\u0627\u0644 1974

And so it rested on my book shelf for more than three years before I brought myself to open it again. The first of altogether five parts turned out to be arduous to read, since I expected an animal's viewpoint, but read a story about two men trying to survive in Canada's wilderness. I finally stopped reading at page forty or so and put it back on my shelves.Then, one year ago, I returned to \"White Fang\", telling myself continuously it couldn't be that bad, and exactly at that point where Part Two began, I fell in love with this book. White Fang's story is told in such a magnificient way, you can't help yourself but root for his wolf, hope for his survival, suffer with him through everything he has to endure. Jack London's novel became one of the first classics I enjoyed, and although some time still had to pass before I would turn my attention towards other classics, it ultimately broke the ice between me and classics, a long lasting antipathy fabricated by my teacher's abilities to kill any interest in reading all those great books out there.Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "[ In many ways Call of the Wild and White Fang are the opposite of each other one the story of a dog becoming a wolf in the wild the other a story of a half wolf coming to love a man.

It bowls you over to such an extent that it feels necessary to calm down and think clearly. I love the ending because it is sweet and definitely overdone and exaggerated and sentimental. You see, because the ending is so sweet and because the earlier sections have been so heartrending, you do not want to think logically. It is nice to just let your heart overflow with happiness. There is even a touch of humor thrown in at the end.I don't know how to rate this. I do know I love the ending.This is a book good for both kids and adults. Why can\u2019t adults read a feel-good story once in a while too?The book was first published in 1906, and is considered a classic. I wondered if it would it be one of those classics that is hard to get through. Would the style of writing be antiquated? No, not in the least. It drags a little bit in the middle, but the beginning is very exciting and at the end you do not want to put it down. I was worried that what we know today about wolves would make what is said here out of date. This is not true either. I was in fact impressed with the accuracy of the knowledge imparted. We see how White Fang, who is one quarter dog and three quarters wolf, sees the world around him, learns how to survive and becomes tame. I liked how we see the world out through his eyes. The audiobook is narrated by John Lee. I am giving the narration five stars. It is seamlessly performed; you never even stop to think you are being read too. The lines just float into your head. Ok, I love the schmaltzy ending, but it is perhaps important to add that any hybrid is an animal that must be handled with caution. This doesn't come to the fore in this book.This was an enjoyable read, and I don\u2019t regret in the least having picked it up.

White Fang is like the mirror image of The Call of the Wild. While The Call of the Wild was about a domestic dog going wild, White Fang is the tale of a (predominately) wolf becoming domesticated.It\u2019s a very sentimental story, structured to get us to identify with the animal. The structure sets us up to view Gray Beaver as fair but unloving, to see Beauty Smith as hateful, and to understand that White Fang\u2019s final owner is the ideal.Oh the changes that our society has been through since these two books were published! London makes a lot of assumptions. He assumes that European culture is superior to that of Native Americans. He assumes that domestication is superior to being wild (it was in Call too, when Buck was owned by John Thornton). He assumes the rightness of the class structure. Each of White Fang\u2019s owners slots into his spot in this world view.I remember have the Classics Illustrated comic book version of this story when I was a child, but I didn\u2019t recall a single detail of the story. It was good to read it again in the unabridged version.I think it is still an excellent book to help children identify with \u201cthe other,\u201d to think about the lives of other creatures.

I know I originally read it when I was about 12 or 14. I would not recommend it to anyone under 14 now, and definitely not to anyone with the slightest tendency towards cruelty or bullying. On this reading I was alternately horrified by the beatings meted out to White Fang and other animals (and their justification), and discomforted by the discourse Jack London creates about the intentions, understandings and intelligences of the three-parts wolf named White Fang.This is the story of White Fang and how he came to accept the life of an Indian camp over freedom in the wilds of Alaska and the Yukon. It tells how that life was taken away from him, and how, through trickery of white man to indian, he was turned into a ferocious fighting animal, used as a gambling medium. And it tells how he was rescued from that life and eventually rehabilitated.I know when I first read this book, life, our culture, was different. Citizen science and social participation were in their infancy, life was full of strict rules of behaviour and it was difficult to imagine anything outside a very humdrum life. The 1960s started the change in all that. So reading Jack London now is a very different experience from reading him in the sixties. My 21st century sensibilities recoil at the ill-treatment of animals, even in the harsh world of the Alaskan tundra forest. I see so many reports of ill-treatment of animals now, that I fear whatever literature exists to support such actions should not be widely mentioned. Bullying appears to be rife, and this book is full of bullying \u2013 of animals. So much contemporary Middle Grade literature seems to deal with bullying from the perspective of the bullied standing up and overcoming the effects. What White Fang seems to do is glorify it again. Or, if not glorify it, to place it as a natural order of things, since Jack London writes interminably about the law of gods and men, and how animals must take their place in that natural law. I remember doing a course in Environmental Ethics and thinking of how the approach of man to his environment changes according to the fashion at the time, utilisation, mastery, stewardship, harmony, sustainable development. This is back in the mastery era.Yes, the book finishes [spoiler alert]with White Fang being freed from cruelty and rehabilitated through kindness and care from liberal-minded but tough travellers. I skipped through the part where he went to California, as I seem to remember I always did in the past. The key events during that time are well-told, and in some ways, White Fang\u2019s rehabilitation is a blueprint for others who seek to retrain ill-treated animals.[/spoiler alert] It ends on a somewhat maudlin note.It is a superbly written book, but I nearly put it down about two-thirds through. I had forgotten the sheer brutality of it. In some ways I can\u2019t believe I have kept this book with me all this time. I wonder whether I mixed the story up with Call of the Wild. I certainly haven\u2019t read it for years. I doubt whether I ever will again.I don\u2019t recommend you read this book.

And I remember how the Aztecs, during their halcyon days succumbed to the power of the Spanish Conquistadors, merely because they though them Gods. Gods who carried guns and firepower. Gods who wore armour. Gods that they sacrificed people to pacify. Gods that ultimately caused their destruction. And no, I'm not giving a history lesson; I'm trying to give an analogy. White Fang, a wolf-dog cross, also almost succumbs to \nhis\n god; Man. White Fang is the splendidly woven, emotionally scarring tale of the eponymous canine (we'll call him a wolf for all intents and purposes, because he's more of a wolf than a dog anyway). I have read some, not too many, but some books where animals are the protagonists, but what makes White Fang different, is that it is narrated from the perspective of the wolf himself. Filled with lush prose, wonderful imagery, and a rather gripping story, White Fang successfully transports the reader to Canada during the gold rush. To a land where man ruled, and ruled without consequences. Before we begin the strange and stupendous tale of our wolf, it would be good to acquaint ourselves with his parents, Kiche and One Ear. White Fang, due to circumstances beyond the control of any mortal that we can think of, barely got to know his parents. He thought of them, of his heritage, his inheritance, but spent little time with them. Kiche was a wonderful mother; loving, caring, affectionate, protective; she even keeps the father away from her cubs, because of the age old myth that he-wolves ate their children. She was gentle, yet firm in her motherhood. \n\"But the Wild is the Wild, and motherhood is motherhood, at all times fiercely protective whether in the Wild or out of it...\"\n Like all mothers, she fed her child, she cared for him, and she was willing to sacrifice herself for him. White Fang, likewise respected, and maybe even loved his mother. Of course, as was the scheme of things for him, and especially at the tender age of a few months, he probably did not realise that it was love, but it was. After having spent the whole day out of his mother's company, and out in the wild, the first thought that White Fang has is that he wanted, at that moment, his mother. And he wanted her more than anything in the world. White Fang respected, even revered her for her admonitions and her laws. \n\"The cub entertained a great respect for his mother... His mother represented power; and as he grew older he felt this power in the sharper admonishment of her paw; while the reproving nudge of her nose gave place to the slash of her fangs. For this, likewise, he respected his mother.\"\n In fact, to a great extent, it is White Fang's undying loyalty and affection to his mother that gets him captured by Grey Beaver in the first place. White Fang, as a wolf, and not a human \nwas not given to thinking\u2014 at least, to the kind of thinking customary of men. His brain worked in dim ways. Yet his conclusions were as sharp and distinct as those achieved by men. He had a method of accepting things, without questioning the why and wherefore. In reality, this was the act of classification. He was never disturbed over why a thing happened. How it happened was sufficient for him.\n Further, \nhe did not reason the question out in this man fashion. He merely classified the things that hurt and the things that did not hurt. And after such classification he avoided the things that hurt, the restrictions and restraints, in order to enjoy the satisfactions and the remunerations of life.\n White Fang lived almost his entire life abiding by the laws of nature. In his head, he formulated and developed these laws until he realised that he could live by these laws by sustaining minimum hurt. \n\"...to life there was limitations and restraints. These limitations and restraints were laws. To be obedient to them was to escape hurt and make for happiness.\"\nWhite Fang leaves his cave, and moves towards the light. Not in a \"close to death fashion\", he literally moves towards the light, and for the first time, he experiences the Wild, the unknown. He feels hurt, and he learns fear. He learns not what these are, but the experiences that cause these emotions. He learns that the Wild is vast and scary. That there are things in the wild that fear him, and that there are other such things that he should fear. White Fang battles the dilemma of fear vs. growth; the former that keeps him cautious, and the latter that urges him forward to explore, to live. From the moment White Fang was captured by Grey Beaver and his squaw though, his life was doomed. Here, for the first time, he had a master, a man-god. \n\"He had never seen the man, yet the instinct concerning man was his. In dim ways he recognised in man the animal that had fought itself to primacy over the other animals of the Wild.\"\n He knew not what power the man-god yielded over him, yet he knew that he owed allegiance; complete and unfettered allegiance to this man-god. The man-god, despite his shortcomings, administered some sense of justice, a concept abstract to White Fang, but a concept he could understand, nevertheless. He recognised it when Lip-Lip, his tormentor was punished for torturing him, and when he was defended by Grey Beaver for his actions. White Fang also, during his time with Grey Beaver, learned the meaning of humiliation, a sensation, an emotion he felt for many years to come. An emotion that came over him when the man-gods laughed at him. But respect them he must, after all \nthey were creatures of mastery, possessing all manner of unknown and impossible potencies, overlords of the alive and the not alive\u2014 making obey that which moved, imparting movement to that which did not move, and making life, sun-coloured and biting life, to grow out of dead moss and wood. They were fire-makers! They were gods.\n During his life with Grey Beaver, White Fang knew not love. He knew respect and loyalty. But not love. Love was not an emotion showered on him; not by the man gods, and definitely not by his fellow dogs, who grew to resent him. Wrongdoing was punished, and doing good was rewarded; rewarded with meat, and with lack of punishment, but not with love. And thus, White Fang became a solitary, vengeful, terrifying creature. \n\"White Fang\u2019s was a service of duty and awe, but not of love. He did not know what love was. He had no experience of love. Kiche was a remote memory.\"\nHis lowest point, perhaps came, when he was sold by Grey Beaver, to Beauty Smith, a man anything but beautiful, both in body and soul. As ugly as he was to look at, he was perhaps more deplorable a human being. Constantly cheating, always evil. As he trained, with clouts and beatings and humiliation, White Fang into a fighting dog, nay beast, White Fang lost all the natural happiness and goodness that he had in him. The little of it that was left in him. Grey Beaver may have hit him, punished him, sure, but he never did so out of spite or hatred. Beauty Smith, a man bred with spite, a man with contempt ingrained in him, turned White Fang into what would be the dogs' version of a psychopath. White Fang rampaged and killed. He growled and bit and fought. And fought unto death he did. He also won each time. Every time. Under the tutelage of the wonderful Beauty Smith, White Fang \nnow became the enemy of all things, and more ferocious than ever.\n Soon, \nHe knew only hate and lost himself in the passion of it.\nHowever, luck finally changed for White Fang. He was rescued by Weedon Smith, miner, prospector, and all around wonderful human being. Weedon Smith cared for him, tended to his wounds, and fed him meat. He didn't hit him, despite being bitten by him. He showed him kindness and affection, emotions that were alien to White Fang. And finally, finally, White Fang learnt love. \n\"As the days went by, the evolution of like into love was accelerated. White Fang himself began to grow aware of it, though in his consciousness he knew not what love was. It manifested itself to him as a void in his being\u2014 a hungry, aching, yearning void that clamoured to be filled. It was a pain and an unrest; and it received easement only by the touch of the new god\u2019s presence. At such times love was joy to him, a wild, keen-thrilling satisfaction. But when away from his god, the pain and the unrest returned; the void in him sprang up and pressed against him with its emptiness, and the hunger gnawed and gnawed unceasingly.\"\n To say that White Fang's tragic beginnings ended on a happy note, a note that he deserved, would be an understatement. To his testament, I leave you with Elton John's melodious vocals. After all, it's the Circle of Life."}, {"userName": "Jade", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2212148-jade", "userReview": "not to treat animals,earth humans or anythingwith disrespect.

There was so much intense action and emotion in this book that reading it was exhilarating for the most part of it. The story is constructed very well, the simple and slick writing doing its part in making the book a joy to read. The initial build-up to the actual story, the story of White Fang, a wolf-dog, was amazing. I felt immersed in the world the author so wonderfully created. This story mixes in a lot of dialogue and arguments that we generally come across when there is a discussion between people on the topic of animal rights. The author sort of plays on these arguments and sentiments as he weaves them into the story of wolves, their lives and their interactions with human species. There were a lot of moments which were profound in regards to the humans' relationship with wild animals. The author makes a curious and probably a symbolic choice of telling us that the wolves see humans as Gods, as in, humans are far more superior than themselves and that humans can do things the wolves dare not dream of. This choice makes a noticeable change in the effect the story has on the reader and for me personally, makes the underlying theme even deeper than it already is.The story of White Fang itself, from its birth till the end, was a gruelling, touching and fierce journey and most of its trials and tribulations are a result of the insensitive cruelty of man, to whom he surrenders and gives his fealty. Many a time I found that someone around me was cutting onions, so I had to close the book and my eyes for some time before resuming. This story was as epic as it was endearing. Heads-up to animal lovers: There is a lot of animal cruelty in this tale and it's painful to read. But the good thing is that it also shows, very beautifully, the special bond humans and dogs share - love and loyalty."}, {"userName": "Mohsin Maqbool", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332742-mohsin-maqbool", "userReview": "A Penguin cover of \"White Fang\".Jack London knows how brutal the weather and environment can be. He has lived in the Yukon (Canada) which has one of the harshest climates in the world. At times the cold can be unbearable even for those living here.After finishing school at 14, Mr. London left for the Yukon where he caught fishes and seals to make a living. Later, on returning to Oakland, California he joined college but dropped out after six months. He then took to writing. He wrote articles and essays for newspapers and short stories for magazines. He also wrote novels some of which like \u201cCall of the Wild\u201d and \u201cWhite Fang\u201d have become classics.A New Yorker cover artist tackles sprucing up the drab walls at local BART stations with odes to Bay Area authors. You can see the passenger reading a hard cover of \"The Call of the Wild\".I had read \u201cCall of the Wild\u201d in 2016 and had loved it. On February 11 and 12 I read \u201cWhite Fang\u201d and loved it as much. There is one main difference between both books. In the first, a pet wolf-dog is stolen and sold. The dog after going through several masters/owners escapes into the wild when his last master, probably his best, is killed by a marauding Native American tribe. In the second, a wild wolf-dog is captured and passes ownership through several masters, including a Californian called Scott.Two Alaskan Athabascan hunters with their weapons.White Fang has four other siblings. His mother trains him to hunt for food and defend himself. Soon he and his mother are taken away by some Alaskan Athabascan tribesmen. But he hardly receives any love from his Athabascan master or the rest of the tribe who don\u2019t believe in showing any feelings towards dogs/pets. However, the tribeswomen are kind enough to throw him morsels of meat/fish from time to time.Genuine Alaska Athabascan Native art, including beadwork and baskets.Soon Wild Fang is bought by a Yukon bully, Beauty Smith, who trains him to become one of the fiercest pit dogs. Pit dogs are used for fighting with other dogs so that the winning dog\u2019s owner can make money through bets. However, soon White Fang ends up with a Californian man called Scott. It takes a lot of patience on Scott's part to train him into a pet. At first he faces a lot of difficulty in gaining Wild Fang\u2019s trust. But he does not give up hope and keeps on persevering. Jack London's quote says it all.After reading \u201cWild Fang\u201d, I watched the film based on it. It starred Ethan Hawke as Scott. Even though it is an entertaining film, it is more a story of the boy rather than the dog. Besides, at least half of the novel has been changed. It ends in the wild of the Yukon with the dog and his master living in a log cabin rather than in a villa in California.

Now it only took two days and it was the nostalgia that helped me finish the book. Adventure books have lost some of their appeal to me as an adult, but I can still appreciate the captivating, descriptive writing. Some parts of this haven't aged well, I can't say that the inspiration that Nietzsche provided for writer is boring, but the absolute strength and quiet dignity of White Fang doesn't hold the same fascination for me as it does the author.I can still appreciate how the allegory of humanity\u2019s progression from nature to civilization is marked by White Fang from wild to tame, but I'm not happy about how Native Americans are represented in this book. London clearly describes white men as 'superior Gods', Grey Beaver sells White Fang after becoming addicted to alcohol provided by Beauty Smith and there are several racial slurs sprinkled through the book.But all in all, I enjoyed the book."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44228074-irene", "userReview": "2.5 stars actually. At first I was going to rate it only 2 stars because I didn't find the story interesting at all and the author rambled way too much to say the most simple of things. Almost everything he said about White Fang and his instincts and experiences could have been said in one or two sentences, instead of writing a whole chapter about how he finally left the cave behind and his (or its) feelings about it. Nevertheless, things changed halfway through the third part and the story really grabbed my attention from then on. Still, London repeated everything again and again and again, so I think that 3 stars is a more than fair rating.At the risk of repeating myself almost as much as London did, I'm going to say that I dragged through the first hundred pages or so. I thought that nothing was going to happen but wrong I was, and I'm glad I persevered and read on because White Fang was well worth reading. First, because it offers an interesting tale of how a wild wolf (I think White Fang was already 75% wolf and 25% dog) would thrive among humans. Thousands of years or evolution probably didn't prepare for that but he learnt quickly and tried to fit in as best as he could. Whether on the wild or in the civilisation, White Fang was wired for survival and survive he did. Sometimes it was almost painful to read how he chose to leave his natural environment behind, how his own mother forgot and rejected him, how men despised him and only saw him as a beast to serve a certain purpose. On a side note, a cousin of mine once had a Siberian husky in Malaga (in case you don't know, that's in the south of Spain, 40\u00b0C in the summer and that kind of weather) and reading White Fang only made me wondered whether she was ever aware of how much that poor animal could have suffered living in such hostile environment for a northern dog. Anyway, perhaps she had ever read White Fang and the happy ending stood with her ... who knows.Second, I particularly enjoyed all the insights about how life was back then in the wildness of Alaska. I don't know much about it so I was curious it and was very interested about the details of the daily lives of the native American who lived there and the gold diggers who flooded the region at the end of the 19th century. Ah, there are so many gaps in my general culture knowledge, particularly in history and geography, so I was happy to learn something new while reading White Fang.All in all, the story could have made a better book, in my opinion, if the writing hadn't been so repetitive. Perhaps this was an issue with the translation, though I'm afraid this has more to do with the writing of those days, back in the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th. I was particularly annoyed by the insistence on that idea about the clay that has been modelled to make White Fang what he was.\"Aquello era vivir, aunque no lo supiera. Se estaba dando cuenta de su propio significado en el mundo; estaba haciendo aquello para lo que hab\u00eda nacido: matar y luchar para matar. Estaba justificando su existencia, lo m\u00e1s grande que la vida puede ofrecer, ya que la vida alcanza su cima cuando realiza aquello para lo que ha sido designada.\" (p. 82)\"No ten\u00eda noci\u00f3n consciente de la muerte, pero, como cada animal salvaje, pose\u00eda su instinto. Para \u00e9l era el dolor m\u00e1s grande. Era la esencia misma de los desconocido; era la suma de los terrores de lo ignoto, la \u00fanica cat\u00e1strofe culminante e impensable que pod\u00eda sucederle, sobre la cual nada sab\u00eda y a la que tem\u00eda por encima de todo.\" (p. 83)\"Para las creatures simples el bien y el mal es algo que puede ser entendido con facilidad. El bien se encuentra en las cosas que reportan comodidad, satisfacci\u00f3n y la superaci\u00f3n del dolor. Por lo tanto, a todo el mundo le gusta el bien. El mal se encuentra en las cosas que est\u00e1n llenas de dificultades, amenazas y dolor, y es repudiado en consecuencia.\" (p.167)"}, {"userName": "Marquise", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4674014-marquise", "userReview": "A bittersweet animal story, but at least with enough \"sweet\" to compensate for the \"bitter\" portion, and definitely compensates for the trauma of the other animal story I read previous to this.

It crushed them with the weight of unending vastness and unalterable decree. It crushed them into the remotest recesses of their own minds...\" Exactly how I felt trudging through chapter 1. I staggered into part four---60% of the way through my slow journey toward the end of the book---exhausted with boredom. I was starved for plot development involving something besides one animal ripping up another, or trying to rip up another, or thinking about ripping up another. It may have driven me to rip the pages of the book, except that I was reading on a Kindle.It was at Fort Yukon that I began to revive, thanks to that scoundrel Beauty Smith. (Heads up: possible spoilers ahead).Finally some food for thought: it was interesting to note that, while the \"cruelty\" of nature may inspire feelings of disgust or pity or even horror (or boredom, as it did with me), it takes the cruelty of a human being to kindle real anger and indignation.Then came the Love God. Despite the unfortunate name (I couldn't erase scary mental images of Don Knotts), here, at last, was something good. I watched the plot development involving Wheedon Smith with suspicious, wary, but hopeful eyes, like White Fang enduring his first pat on the head.More interesting food for thought: although White Fang's nature had been shaped by the harshness of the wild and the cruelty of men, kindness eventually tamed him to some extent. Not so London's two \"beastly\" men: Beauty Smith and Jim Hall. Why?By the time the book ended, I was almost beginning to enjoy it. Perhaps my reading experience was what London intended: the savage, cold remote wilderness is not a place of enjoyment or contentment. Only where man has begun to tame the wild can peace and happiness and laughter occur---not the mocking, savage laughter of Grey Beaver or Beauty Smith, but the caring, joyful laughter of Wheedon Smith.All in all, I'm glad I made the journey.

Growing up in the Yukon territory of Canada during the Klondike Gold Rush, he learned the law of the Wild at an early age: kill, or be killed, eat, or be eaten. Separated from his mother and traded from master to master, White Fang never grasped the concept of love, and violence was all that he knew. Having no teacher, he learned the rules of survival by experience. Then, a cruel man buys White Fang and turns him into a pit dog forced to fight for money. With beautifully realistic details of the harsh realities of life in the Yukon, White Fang is a grippingly original tale about morality and redemption that still stands as an American classic.I first bought my copy of White Fang in 2007 shortly after I had graduated from middle school. We had read Jack London\u2019s other book, The Call of the Wild, in English class and I got it into my head that I should read the \u201cother book\u201d as well (for fun because I am that much of a nerd). The book gathered dust on my bookshelf for six years until a week ago when I finally decided to read it. I honestly did not expect to enjoy White Fang as much as I did and even viewed reading it with trepidation. London, however, captivated me with White Fang\u2019s point of view: it was refreshing to see a different perspective of humans from an unlikely character that I couldn\u2019t help rooting for, despite his propensity for violence. I was shocked to read how easily White Fang, a true product of the Wild, succumbed to the superior human \u201cgods\u201d and how mistreated he was, bringing to light the violence and cruelty against animals. This story is NOT Bambi, so none of the animals talked; instead, London used both circumstance and action to establish relationships and individual characters.
