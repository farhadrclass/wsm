I love her books, but the last two I've read were definitely not my favorites.The beginning of this book leads you to believe that it's going to be a mystery, of sorts. We were at least going to find out why the person who died, Adam, was not exactly who he said he was. Ok, so maybe we did find that out eventually, but I was surprised that that ended up being a very small part of the story. Instead, it goes on (and on and on) into the self-centered ridiculous lives of the other residents of the town who were so \"devastated\" by Adam's death. But they seemed way more devastated than they should have been, like it was really all an act. And Marina, who, at the beginning, was the person most important to Adam, turns out to be the person who best pulls herself together and moves on with her life. Maybe because she left town and wasn't ridiculously rich like everyone else?I still like the book, but I was disappointed in it. I kept looking for the meaning in the book, but there wasn't any for me. Yes, it pulled itself together in the end (in a surprisingly neat and tidy way that almost bothered me for it's neat and tidiness) but by then I was just glad that the whining was over."}, {"userName": "Jaline", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline", "userReview": "Adam Berendt dominates this story from Page 1, even though he is involved in a fatal accident. An enigmatic man, who avoided any questions about his past or his personal life, he was a sculptor and philosopher, physically unappealing but every man\u2019s friend and the lover every woman coveted. The impact of this character on everyone else in the book is explored in Joyce Carol Oates\u2019 signature way: courageously, with unstinting honesty, and in many instances, uncomfortably real. Even when I was cringing at some of the characters\u2019 words and actions, I was swept up in the authenticity of their experience. I would recommend this book to all readers who enjoy deep, meaningful character studies \u2013 and how people\u2019s lives are unerringly governed by both their successes and their follies. If the inner workings of people\u2019s thoughts and feelings are not your preference, I recommend this to everyone who enjoys a great story that is superbly well told."}, {"userName": "Gerald", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75671-gerald", "userReview": "On these pages, someone mentioned Anne Tyler and Joyce Carol Oates in the same breath. I'm a big fan of Ms. Tyler and I've read all her books, some more than once. But I'd never read more than a short story from Ms. Oates. So with this reading I repaired that error.Comparisons are irresistible. Unlike Ms. Tyler, Ms. Oates does not love her characters unconditionally. The narrator's attitude seems to be one of newspaper-journalist cynic. All of her characters are fools. Rich, spoiled fools. Which tempts another comparison - to another journalist-cynic - Tom Wolfe.Is this a New York thing?Or maybe it's a middle-aged thing.Because as the characters in Middle Age begin to emerge from it - perhaps it's a temporary condition crazed as adolescence - they become decent, tender, and loving, almost unbelievably so.I'll reserve judgment until I've read some more of Ms. Oates to see whether she ridicules her characters no matter what their age. Come to think of it, the few younger characters in this book are arrogant snots."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1092991-danielle", "userReview": "This is the second book I've read by Joyce Carol Oates and I think despite the fact that she is Alison's favorite author it will be the last. I find all her characters to be too whiny and unsympathetic I think. This book had a lot of characters and I struggled to like a single one of them. Plus I wonder, at least based on this book, about Oates's view of women. All of them were middle-aged unself-fulfilled women chasing after men who didn't care about them or allowing themselves to be taken advantage of by men who disgusted them. I don't get behind the whole you disgust me I want nothing to do with you until you force yourself on me and then I'll melt into your arms deal. Not realistic and totally propagating date rape in my opinion. Not that any raping occurs in this book, I just think stuff like that gives people the idea that no doesn't mean no. At any rate the book centers around a guy named Adam who moves at some point in his adulthood to this small upper class town in New York. It is evident from the first few pages of the book that he has a secret past. He also dies in the first chapter or so and you figure the story is going to be about the discovery of his past after his death. Not so much. The story revolves around all these people in the town who knew him and their sad pathetic lives. All of them, mostly the women, but a couple of the men (not sexually) were entirely obsessed with Adam for some reason that remains elusive at least to me. So you get to find out what happens to their lives in the wake of his death. Finally near the end of the almost 500 page book you find out about Adam's past. It was rather a let down and not worth reading through all the melodrama to find out about. I would definitely skip this book if I were you."}, {"userName": "Christine Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7612461-christine-beverly", "userReview": "The first time I read this book, I was in my early thirties, and I probably would've scored it lower then if I'd had a Goodreads account. Now as a middle-aged woman, this book speaks powerfully to me, which I think is kind of the point. The blurb for this book makes it all about Adam Berendt, but the book really isn't about Adam. Adam is merely the event, the shock to the characters' comfortable and settled lives that is the impetus for the changes they go through. And every character is confronted by change, meeting it differently...which is what middle age is really about: \"In the prime of their lives, they'd been successful and then, perhaps abruptly, unexpectedly something had happened--illness, accident, financial losses, disappointing children, divorce, death--to break them and make them doubt everything they'd believed in. Yet somehow they'd mended, and made a decision to live, and to live happily, as long as possible.\" Adam is the personification of this unexpected something, but each character confronts at least one of the items Oates lists. Some come out of this confrontation stronger, more wise, more accepting, more in touch...while others fail to make the transition at all. Salthill on the Hudson, the community of the book, is merely a microcosm of the middle aged world--people who all have to confront their own limitations and experience the weakness of it before deciding how Life: Part II will be lived. I think those who read this expecting a typical \"romance\" miss the point--this is a book about falling in love with yourself despite an aging, less attractive body. It's about the romance you have to develop with the self you are becoming, no apologies and despite expectations.I'm glad I picked it back up, and if you read it, but didn't love it the first time, pick it up after your own \"unexpected something\" makes you change, mend, and decide to live...it will resonate."}, {"userName": "Dusty", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/655483-dusty", "userReview": "If you like Desperate Housewives you will probably like this book.Adam has just died in a heroic boating accident, leaving behind a tight-knit community of well-to-do NYC suburbanites who are as confused about his death as they are about how they should continue on with their own lives. One woman decides to run away to the Pennsylvania mountains for a year. Another just runs away. Various men become involved with far-younger women, and one of these men's abandoned wives turns their million-dollar estate into an informal kennel for unwanted dogs. What do these characters have in common? You guessed it: middle age.I have read several of Joyce Carol Oates's short stories, and I've read that she's among the United States' finest writers, that she and Philip Roth are our best hope for another Nobel Prize within the next decade, and I can appreciate the irony and styled prose with which she weaves this novel's interconnected stories. However. This is one repetitive five-hundred page book. (A friend of mine says that's \"Oates's style\", to revisit and revisit certain topics.) The book is called Middle Age, and there's no way you'll forget that its characters, who are described as \"old middle age\" and \"youthful middle age\" and so on, are all middle aged. Even the dogs are middle aged. I'm not making that up.My problem with the repetition is, it seems to come at the expense of the book's conclusion. Take a look at the Table of Contents: \"Part 1\" and \"Part 2\" are each about 200 pages long. And they move slowly -- lots of talk of Marina's knotted wine-red hair, of Adam's glossy blinded eye, of the woes and crises of middle age. \"Part 3\", the resolution to all these woes and crises, is only 60 pages, and many of the chapters contained therein are concluded elliptically, with only an indication of how the characters have changed now that they've survived middle age and are headed -- where exactly?At times I loved the book, and at times I hated it, but in the end, it succeeds at what it is: An old-fashioned dramedy of interwoven suburban tragedies and revelations. You're welcome to watch it on Sunday nights with Terri Hatcher and Felicity Huffman, but if you need a harder fix, you'll find it from Joyce Carol Oates."}, {"userName": "Shelley Ettinger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/289457-shelley-ettinger", "userReview": "Nowhere near her masterpiece level (Blonde, The Falls), but pretty good, and I give her major props for the meaty section about the racist prison/injustice system and the death penalty, and the privileged fancy lawyer learning a little something about the real world from his work on a death row case. Much class consciousness and social commentary throughout, as always, which makes reading about a bunch of highly overprivileged people palatable. Unusually, there's a confluence of happy endings except for one jackass who gets his comeuppance which was sort of delicious.One complaint: Most revered JCO, please stop misusing the word \"bemused,\" or at least if you're going to misuse it don't use it so often. Bemused means musing, thinking about, in a state of musing. It is not a synonym for amused.

Mid-life crises unspool, opening a depressing window on what lies ahead for those who have yet to acknowledge they're old. Most of the wealthy Salthill characters are so self-centered, it's hard to care about them. Sure, they all have their \"romances,\" but they're passionless and disconnected. As a result, the reader is kept at a distance, watching, instead of feeling. Berendt's secret past fails to live up to the 400 page build-up, and its revelation still leaves some questions unanswered. Ultimately, Middle Age equals middle-of-the-road."}, {"userName": "Thomas Str\u00f6mquist", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-str-mquist", "userReview": "At the very start of this novel, one of the main characters dies when saving the life of a drowning young girl.

Five for the ultimately redemptive close of the book, with ends tied up and possibilities opened up like windows, to admit fresh air. Five for the intricately woven plot, embedding a mystery which serves as a touchstone for multiple story threads: you can re-invent yourself, in some pretty surprising ways. Five for character growth--lots of originally annoying characters show some amazing but believable transformations. There's some dark humor (although this is not a \"comic romp\" as the cover suggests).But--Joyce Carol Oates (as always) lacks a serious editor. The prose is repetitive. The similes and metaphors range from brilliant to confusing to repulsive, including a point where a central character's penis is referred to as a \"thalidomide arm.\" Oates tries to shock us, paint pictures for us, instruct and inspire us--and succeeds only sometimes. It takes awhile for the plot to kick in, to hook us on the story. Until then, it just feels overwritten."}, {"userName": "Mariano Hortal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377752-mariano-hortal", "userReview": "\"Vivir. Lo que damos por supuesto que las otras personas saben hacer.\" En \"A Media Luz\" la escritora Joyce Carol Oates se sirve de la muerte de un vecino de la peque\u00f1a localidad de Salthill-on-Hudson para realizar un retrato de la madurez de las personas que estuvieron relacionadas con \u00e9l de una u otra manera (amantes ficticias, reales, albacea, amigos....).

I thought it would be funny (there is a misleading blurb on the back) but it\u2019s really quite thoughtful and sad. I love how Oates weaves together the different stories of so many individuals whose lives touch. You get to feel like you know everyone in Salt Hill on Hudson, New York.Everyone is rich and middle-aged. (I was briefly horrified to realize these \u201cmiddle-aged\u201d characters were frequently my age or younger. So like the characters themselves!) There is a lot of dealing with mortality. There are timeless themes, and the characters are all well-realized and interesting.But what sold me on this and bumped it up to a four star rating was the ending.

I do understand why she is compared to Updike in that she offers a window onto American life in a way that is uniquely hers.While I laughed at the characters weaknesses in the first half of the book, by the second half, I was tired of them and felt the outcomes where quite predictable.

When a moved to Virginia eight years ago, I started to drink sweetened iced tea. We southerners call it \u2018sweet tea.\u2019 So now, here I am on GR and I seem to be surrounded by people reading and loving romance novels. I have never been a romance or soap opera person and I have been reading a long time. I would even call my attitude about the romance genre as derisive. But I am reading Middle Age A Romance by Joyce Carol Oates and it says \u2018romance\u2019 right there in the title. But I don\u2019t know if it is really a romance. So I can\u2019t decide if I should like it or not! Help me out, please. What is it about \u2018romance\u2019 novels that people like and is JCO a \u2018romance\u2019 writer?There are some things about JCO that I am not sure about. As I read more of her books, I will be examining how she deals with sexism with examples of date rape, male domination and women as objects in Middle Age. Can a feminist admire JCO? Maybe I should just ask my 18 year old daughter to read this book and to let me know. JCO also confronts ageism as she explores the young middle aged and the old middle aged, the young beautiful women and than the old dowdy. The author seems to be describing a world she sees rather than a world she prefers. But I would have to see a balance of characters that are non-sexist and non-ageist to get some vision of available life choices. And I don\u2019t recall seeing many JCO characters that show women as equals of men. Well, maybe Naomi Volpe, the bisexual, paralegal near the end of the book \u2026 But even this is more role reversal rather than equality. Rarely now did he and Volpe have sex, and that only when Volpe, aroused from a day of frustrations at the office, initiated it. JCO characters explore some unusual options and different pathways through life. One man sees polygamy as the natural state with adultery as the available option in the current society. For one woman, maybe it is that she is a lesbian and that explains everything. Some characters in Middle Age do actually change for the better in the end. Hooray!In the male world that JCO creates, she has many portraits of women. They are women who most frequently (but not always) see themselves as subservient to the men: If the women\u2019s sharp eyes have observed that the Donegal Croom who stands before them is a battered-looking wreck in his fifties who bears only a fleeting resemblance to his handsome publicity photos, they are too tactful to acknowledge it; these are women accustomed to not seeing imperfections in men, though anxiously aware of the smallest imperfections in themselves. There is an outrageousness about many of the characters JCO creates. And there is an over the top absurdity of aspects of the story. But how can I judge this one book by JCO without reading many more? Some of the topics in just this one book include small town America, modern American society, the privileged upper middle class, marriage and divorce, dysfunctional families, self-knowledge, capital punishment, parenting, morality, abortion and more. And she has dozens of books and short stories and plays and poems and essays. I will be looking for and working on that summary statement about JCO. But I am beginning to suspect that there is no easy summary for JCO who does it all and just keeps cranking out words.From a reading guide for this book from the publisher: In an interview with Greg Johnson, her biographer, Joyce Carol Oates said, \"All my longer novels are political, but not obtrusively so, I hope.\"http://www.harpercollins.com/author/m...You might want to check out the biography of JCO, Invisible Writer.

After reading the first few pages, I thought the subject matter of this book was going to be depressing \u2013 a man loses his life after saving a small child in the water \u2013 and it relatively is. After the first quarter of the book or so however, the story unfolds with the deceased man as the pinnacle character and role-model of the book who has the power to influence and change other people\u2019s ordinary lives after his death with drastic changes and results.The writing style is witty and intelligent throughout and Oates manages to develop and interweave her characters to the highest level. Her main message seems to be that life needs to continually challenged and after the protagonist\u2019s death, Oates remaining characters are forced to re-think their often idealistic situations in life in order to reach full satisfaction and fulfilment of their lives.Prior to reading Oates, I had thought of her as more of a feminist writer but this book has altered this impression. Instead she comments fully and is supportive of both genders although she does give the odd witty remark about the female condition and her standard serious tone is interspersed with a nice bit of wit. Her account of pregnancy - \u201cOf course it\u2019s different for a man! A man shoots his seed into a small hole out of which, nine months later, a woman pushes a watermelon with arms and legs. That\u2019s the difference\u201d \u2013 made me howl and chuckle out loud. A slice of criticism of the book lies with its length and depth and whilst it\u2019s an easy and delightful read, it does take a long time to digest. I finished the book with a lot of invested reading over about 4 days over an otherwise un-busy period. It\u2019s not a book I would want to read with other books on the go as it\u2019s quite intensive (yet satisfying) work.

His sudden death has a profound effect on everyone who knew him in Salthill. However, it becomes obvious, very quickly, that no one really knew Adam Berendt. They thought he was a poor man, but he wasn't. He had used several names and made millions of dollars. No one could locate his family, or even knew if there was a family. What is Adam's story, and how has he managed to touch people's lives so profoundly?I enjoyed this novel tremendously, because the characters are all so well drawn and different from each other, and their various reactions to losing Adam reveal much about their individual self-esteems and what they think about love in general. This novel also carries the message that anyone can find a way to make life more meaningful for themselves if they do a little soul searching, and one need not stick to the most conventional path.While reading about the enigmatic Adam Berendt, I couldn't help being reminded--just a wee bit--of Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride. Both novels are centered around an intriguing mystery-person who has a profound effect on many people. Of course, the books are opposites in that the enigmatic person in Atwood's book has traumatized others, not helped them. Both novels are written in compelling ways.Both Atwood and Oates are too prolific to keep up with in one lifetime, I'm afraid."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241983-elizabeth", "userReview": "I ended up liking this book in the end, but it sure didn't seem that way in the beginning. I found the first 100 pages (maybe 150 or 200?) very tedious and Oates' writing style tiring (so many long, long sentences, endless tangential description, and pages-long paragraphs). I hated all of the characters. I felt as if I'd read this story somewhere before: a man dies, and a small, wealthy, white Northeastern town reels from the loss of a person the residents had all believed in as someone better than themselves. The next 400 pages follow various acquaintances of the dead man and their grieving processes...His death heralds changes for all of them... Do their actions make them better people in the end? More likable characters? Meh, not really. But they are saved from themselves and their grief (each in their own way) and I suppose that's what pulled me through the rest of the book. I ended up rooting for some of the very characters I hated. It's very American, this novel, and I guess I sometimes tire of stories like this because we live them. Maybe that's why I can't bring myself to give this four stars. On the other hand, Oates is talented enough to capture us all as we are, and in the end I suppose this is why the novel is worth reading."}, {"userName": "Eugenea Pollock", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38458766-eugenea-pollock", "userReview": "It's been years, maybe 35, since I last picked up a book by this author, and that book was \"Bellefleur.\" I did not like it and, therefore, avoided her work for a very long time. Despite the terrible, boring title of this book, I came across it (how, I don't know), read the sample, and decided to give it a try. I have to say that, to my complete surprise, it sucked me in so hard and so fast...I've not done much else but read it. The central character is a dead man, Adam Berendt, a sculptor/philosopher with a mysterious past whose relationships with all other residents of the fictional village of Salthill-on-Hudson, whether platonic, romantic, real, imagined, professional, or otherwise, drive the action in this book. I recognized people I know in these characters, and sometimes Oates's insight into the dynamics of human interaction was blinding. There is literally nothing about this book that I did not love--structure, plot, style, resolution, you-name-it. Oops, that's not true--the title really does stink. Most of the characters are in their fifties, but a demographic title is just a cop-out that discourages folks from ever picking it up in the first place."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8603977-susan", "userReview": "This book was excruciating to finish. I disliked the characters who inspired no sympathy for their wealthy, over-indulged \"problems\", and who spouted sophomoric philosophies and demonstrated no ability to learn from their collective experience and wisdom, and all of whom needed constant reassurance that they were beautiful, wealthy, important, artistic. I disliked Adam, the dead guy, who was not a believable character, nor inspiring; as well, his \"secret\" in the end was banal and pointless. They all thought he was in love with them, despite him showing them that he was not and despite him being almost rude to them over the years. Oh my goodness, I disliked them all.By all rights, these are the same people John Cheever wrote so eloquently about, but there is a spark in his stories that is just not there in these folks. I paid for this book and hoped the end would make the rest of it worth reading. It didn't."}, {"userName": "Rita", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76512-rita", "userReview": "2001Another excellent, insightful novel by Oates.Gracious, what a lot of characters, but they do keep coming back, and are bound together by all living in the same village [in the present day, i.e. 1990s].Oates sure knows her psychology, we hear a lot of each character's inner thoughts. And what a lot of behaviors we see, from parent-teenage interaction to marriages and liaisons.Quite positive/optimistic on the whole: one father, and one mother, each get a chance to raise a child again later in life, after having messed up badly on their first child [raised in each case by the other parent].Do we see Adam Berendt as a sort of modern-day Jesus? Human, yet doing his best to help many other people in their struggles, counseling them. It sometimes helps that he has a huge amount of money... Curiously one character uses a POLAROID camera!Is Highland NY the village she is modeling her Salthill-on-Hudson on?"}, {"userName": "Nicholas", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/646385-nicholas", "userReview": "I read someone praising this book recently and suggested it for my book club. I owe all that book club's members a sincere apology, because this was just awful. Endless, first of all. Meandering, second. I could not tell whether JCO was writing in a way that she thought was beautiful but I found it completely affected and precious. The constant repeating of what the reader already knows: \"Salthill-on-Hudson! Marina found herself living there. Managing a bookstore!\" Yes, we knew this, a thousand times over we already knew it. By the end--scratch that, 100 pages in--all I wanted was for it to be over. I did not care one bit about Adam Berendt's secret past, which turned out not to be all that revealing or interesting. While certain characters were kind of fun in a wacky way (Camille, Gussie, Naomi), it was just so overwritten that it was difficult to enjoy them."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11986475-ellen", "userReview": "I have read JCO in the New Yorker, shorter pieces -- and so I picked up this book wondering if it would grab me. The first line: \"Is this fair? You leave your home ... and return days later in a cheesy-looking funeral urn...\" The first character has lived and died within the first paragraph! I was hooked.The whole book examines the question of our lives in middle age (often characters wonder, why am I here?) I wonder that every day. One character's answer to the question -- because it was the alternative to swallowing 37 pills the night before. My kind of truth-telling.And if she can make me believe that showing up for the historical society fund raiser actually might lead a suicidal woman to discover a new life, that again is an amazing feat and a book I want to read.

It wasn't my favorite Oates novel. I think you always learn something about life when you pick of her novels as her characters are always very human (flawed, beautiful, terrible) and you swear you know someone like them. I won't go on and summarize, just to say all of her work is worth reading, you always take something away and are left with heavy thoughts but not my favorite."}], "description": "In Salthill-on-Hudson, a half-hour train ride from Manhattan, everyone is rich, beautiful, and -- though they look much younger -- middle-aged.
