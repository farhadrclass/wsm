I loved going to these movies. And I worked at a theatre in downtown Seattle during the early seventies when many of these films played their first-run roadshow/hard ticket releases. This is not my memory of the era.One would think that an exclamation point after the word \u2018roadshow\u2019 in the title might indicate enthusiasm. But in this case it must instead indicate irony, because the author seems not to like any of these films except perhaps Fiddler on the Roof and Cabaret. In a depressing litany concerning some 20 films released between 1965 and 1972 he just goes on and on about all the perceived short-comings of each and everyone of them. He liberally quotes both Rex Reed--who nobody ever took seriously then or now as a film critic--and Pauline Kael who, while a fabled writer, never was a champion for main stream Hollywood cinema. He also delights in long lists of how many kegs of nails and board feet of lumber and lengths and types of fabric were used in all these films. And for some reason he chooses to ignore the more than two dozen non-musical films that were released as roadshow engagements in this relatively brief seven-year period. They certainly had a bearing on the disappearance of the roadshow exhibition model as well.Many have commented on his glaring Sondheim error re. Funny Girl. While early on it does call into questions his musical theatre chops, I\u2019ll give him a begrudging pass as Sondheim & Jule Styne did collaborate on the score for another showbiz biography, Gypsy, a few years earlier. The chronology of the book is a mess. I understand that he wanted to indicate a continuum of the events described. However there are many times that without a skipped line between paragraphs he starts talking about another film. Wait wasn\u2019t I just reading about Finian's Rainbow? How\u2019d we get to Oliver!? And not devoting a chapter to each film makes it difficult to impossible to review what was said about any specific film. He also seems to believe that we were all waiting for the big Hollywood film to go away so we could have more films like Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and The Graduate and Easy Rider (his favorite go-to hip references). Can\u2019t I enjoy the most recent Disney or Pixar release and still enjoy the latest Richard Linklater offering too? Since when was movie going ever an either or proposition?And yet for all of this he ends with the observation: \u201cWe\u2019ve been herded into Cineplex boxes and subjected to ads for breath mints and the United States Marine Corps ever since. Movies turned digital, got smaller, not bigger, and are now made on computers compatible with laptops and cell phones. We who love real movies lit from behind through celluloid would rather be sitting in the Rivoli as the house lights dim and the overture begins on something big and beautiful in 70-millimeter.\u201d Yes, Mr. Kennedy, yes."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2678481-john", "userReview": "This had all the earmarks of something that I would love. A film history book about the over-produced musicals of the late 60s and early 70s. Right? Unfortunately, this book was a big disappointment. It's full of quotes, facts and history but lacks heart. It seems to be written by someone who A. Doesn't like these movies. B. May not even like musicals. Over than one or two, he has nothing nice to say about these movies. True some are awful but awful in an enjoyable way. Most of his trashing is regurgitating critic's opinions. A sad, depressing read that could have been so much more. The history itself is fascinating and I would like to say heavily researched, however, I came across multiple errors in the text. Since then I've heard from other folks who found even more mistakes. To his credit, he has undertaken a very expansive project but the mistakes I found were so easily checked it made me wonder what else is wrong. Easily checked mistakes like a mistitled song from Half a Sixpence ('Money to Burn' NOT 'Playing On Banjo'?!)or stating that Jule Styne and STEPHEN SONDHEIM were the composer/lyricist team for Funny Girl. It should have been Styne and Bob Merrill. And then strange omissions. He mentions that Richard Rodgers questioned whether Julie Andrews would be photogenic enough to play Maria on film yet makes no mention of the fact that years earlier Julie had been handpicked by Rodgers and Hammerstein to star in their TV musical Cinderella. True TV and Film are different mediums but it's an odd exclusion. Even odder is during one of the frequent fact spouting he mentions that Max Jacobson, the famous speed pushing 'Dr. Feelgood' was one of the visitors on the set of 'Paint Your Wagon' yet doesn't mention that the film's Writer/Lyricist/Producer Alan Jay Lerner was a 'patient' of the Dr's and had a serious speed addiction at the time which likely negatively influenced his decisions on that production. Sad. I love these films. It's too bad the author doesn't."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62202-amanda", "userReview": "While it's great that this period of the musical genre's history is starting to get more attention, and while Kennedy has clearly done a great deal of necessary archival and primary document research, his argument is simplistic and old hat. Though his analysis of the genre's development is a bit more nuanced than some, his book offers nothing new to the history of the film musical. Pick up almost any history of the musical and you will find this same basic argument, written in the same basic tone: that the musical genre died in the 1960s because the films were simply bad. The chronological structure makes for a disjointed read, as accounts of individual films are fragmented and spread throughout multiple chapters, and this also makes it impractical to use this book as a reference for information about a specific musical. There are some mistakes in terms of names, song titles, or dialogue quotations that I found quite annoying (and that in this age of DVD and the internet are easily double-checked and corrected), and Kennedy sometimes contradicts himself on smaller points within his larger argument. If you are interested solely in the production histories of these musicals, the book has a great deal to offer, and it can provide some useful details. As a historical argument about the development of the musical genre within the larger context of the history of Hollywood filmmaking, it leaves much to be desired and can prove quite a frustrating read."}, {"userName": "Michael Ritchie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4649853-michael-ritchie", "userReview": "At last, a work of pop culture non-fiction that is educational and a joy to read. The topic is the big, bloated movie musicals of the late 60s-early 70s that followed in the wake of the success of The Sound of Music, and the author covers them all, mostly big flops like Camelot and Star!, with an occasional hit like Fiddler on the Roof, writing well about the making of the films and the (usually negative) reception by press and public. He ties his subject to the death of the \"roadshow\" engagement, in which a movie would play in a limited number of cities and theaters with reserved seat tickets, and he has whetted my appetite for another book that would cover the non-musical roadshows. I recommend this to movie fans without reservation (pun intended)."}, {"userName": "Joel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2653618-joel", "userReview": "I expected more, or rather, something different. What is a roadshow film, why were they popular, and why did they then cease to be popular? The author doesn't really tell us. Rather, we get a lot of behind-the-scenes stories about the making of a number of movie musicals, and then some critiques of the films themselves. There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking here. Why did one film succeed while another doesn't? It's hard to know -- the author doesn't take much time to explain the \"why.\" Many of these stories are entertaining, but to what end?

Many of these films are notoriously flawed, but he Kennedy has no affinity for their source material (when based on Broadway titles).

It\u2019s that kind of book, only about movie musicals. In Hollywood parlance, a roadshow was a movie that was long, very expensive, and presented in large theaters with reserved seating at inflated prices before it made its way to your neighborhood movie house. This 1960s practice was a ploy to lure people away from their televisions and once again see movie going as a special experience. Along came The Sound of Music and its astounding success. Filmmakers clamored to make bigger and richer clones of this blockbuster. Thus came films of My Fair Lady, Camelot, Hello Dolly!, Oliver!, Funny Girl, Man of La Mancha, and original musicals like Dr. Dolittle, Star!, and Goodbye Mr. Chips, among others. All these films had one thing in common: they were overblown and bloated. They had their charms, but for the most part, they were so expensive that studios did not recoup their investments (or barely made a profit) and film critics ripped them apart. Producers fought with directors; directors fought with actors. In an attempt to have that one hit that would save the studio with its huge financial returns, producers greenlighted expenditures like water flowing from a never-closed spigot. The movies featured, in many cases, actors who were not singers, demanded enormous salaries, and had even more enormous egos. The films won awards, but then again, film awards are often given by groups who have a horse in the race: after all the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences, those folks who give out Oscars, is made up of movie industry employees. It behooves them to bestow accolades on films that will reap the most profits by having won an Oscar. But aye, here\u2019s my rub\u2014I adored almost all of these musical movies. I eagerly awaited their arrival no matter what I read from critics, and the movies did not disappoint me. My Fair Lady was elegant and tuneful; Camelot was richly appointed, visually stunning; Star! Featured Julie Andrews for three glorious hours, singing her heart out without being surrounded by children; Funny Girl brought us the sublime Barbra Streisand for the first time on screen; Goodbye Mr. Chips had Peter O\u2019Toole in his finest performance. My list could go on and on. So it is disheartening to me to read about the faults of these films, to read how overbearing many of the stars were\u2014Streisand fought with the director, O\u2019Toole couldn\u2019t sing a note on key, complained about everything in Man of La Mancha, Rex Harrison was overbearing and had an insane wife, Andrews was not the sweet girl we\u2019d come to know\u2014to read the off-screen machinations of the studio heads as they threatened, spent lavishly or withheld money, hired and fired, and to read that critics of the time often based their critiques more on these off-screen doings than the merits of the films. I admit the book is fascinating as Hollywood history, but what bothers me is that I got the impression that Kennedy, a film historian, really doesn\u2019t like musicals at all. He reports his well-documented, well-researched history, and I applaud his work. Then, he critiques the films\u2014or at least, it seemed to me that he was speaking as himself, the viewer\u2014and I heard very little regard for the performances, the production values, the writing, or anything else. Yes, I see the faults in these films, but the pleasures outweigh those. I am aware that the singing in Man of La Mancha is abysmal, that Goodbye Mr. Chips is designed to pull at our heartstrings, and that Oliver! is torn between being a light and lively musical and bleak comment on the underbelly of London during the Dickens era. But I get joy from all of them and most of the others. Yes, Song of Norway is a dog of a movie, and yes, Hello Dolly! is so over the top it is laughable and Streisand is totally miscast, but a recent viewing of the film left me humming the tunes and smiling. So read Roadshow for the history, read Roadshow if you hate musicals, read Roadshow if you want your bubble burst. But if you are upset by all you find out about your favorite movie from the 1960s, know that I am here to commiserate with."}, {"userName": "Biblio Files (takingadayoff)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff", "userReview": "A roadshow was a movie released by a major studio, in just a few theaters at first and with great fanfare, then weeks or months later, released slowly to other theaters throughout the country. Tickets were issued at higher than normal prices and with assigned seating. The idea seemed to be to make the movie experience more like a Broadway theater experience. I did not know about this phenomenon until I visited Graumann's Theater in Hollywood and saw a display of fancy tickets and programs from movies in the 1920s and 1930s. I didn't realize the practice continued into the early 1970s until I read this book.It all seems rather quaint now that the blockbuster movies are released on as many screens as possible all at once and if a new release doesn't impress on the first day, it disappears quickly. In the 60s even the worst flop would take months to fail.Matthew Kennedy begins with the most successful roadshow, The Sound of Music. This was the peak of the roadshow phenomenon and for movie musicals as well. For the next ten years, movie musicals got more expensive and overproduced and never achieved the success of Sound of Music. Movie studios went broke trying.Kennedy gets into the nuts and bolts of putting together a 60s musical and even into the finances. And then there's the gossip. The story of the making of Doctor Dolittle is my favorite of this bunch, with Rex Harrison insulting everyone and his wife (who wasn't in the movie) creating a scene wherever she went. Of course the movies that were flops are the most fun to read about. Paint Your Wagon was doomed from the start, and Finian's Rainbow could have been halfway good, but boneheaded moves like filming Fred Astaire's dance scenes so that his feet weren't visible on screen kept it from having a chance.Roadshow! is a fun look at a slice of movie history."}, {"userName": "Carly Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/245301-carly-thompson", "userReview": "Interesting and informative book about the big musicals of the late 1960s that nearly killed the genre. After the success of Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, and The Sound of Music all the Hollywood studios wanted to make big lengthy musicals and present them as roadshows (exclusive engagements at one theatre in a city with high ticket prices). Unfortunately the quality of the movies made ranged from average to horrible. Kennedy presents a great overview of the movies and personalities involved. There were a few factual errors that I caught - Sondheim did not write Funny Girl - and most of the information came from archives and previously published interviews and news stories. I haven't seen many of these movies and wasn't able to appreciate their quality for myself.

Audience members dressed up and arrived early to peruse the program during the overture that preceded the curtain's rise. And when the show began, it was--a rather disappointing film musical.In Roadshow!, film historian Matthew Kennedy tells the fascinating story of the downfall of the big-screen musical in the late 1960s. It is a tale of revolutionary cultural change, business transformation, and artistic missteps, all of which led to the obsolescence of the roadshow, a marketing extravaganza designed to make a movie opening in a regional city seem like a Broadway premier. Ironically, the Hollywood musical suffered from unexpected success. Facing doom after its bygone heyday, it suddenly broke box-office records with three rapid-fire successes in 1964 and 1965: Mary Poppins,  My Fair Lady, and The Sound of Music. Studios rushed to catch the wave, but everything went wrong. Kennedy takes readers inside the making of such movies as Hello, Dolly! and Man of La Mancha, showing how corporate management imposed financial pressures that led to poor artistic decisions-for example, the casting of established stars regardless of vocal or dancing talent (such as Clint Eastwood in Paint Your Wagon). And Kennedy explores the impact of profound social, political, and cultural change. The traditional-sounding Camelot and Doctor Dolittle were released in the same year as Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, representing a vast gulf in taste. The artifice of musicals seemed outdated to baby boomers who grew up with the Cuban missile crisis, the Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations, race riots, and the Vietnam War.From Julie Andrews to Barbra Streisand, from Fred Astaire to Rock Hudson, Roadshow! offers a brilliant, gripping history of film musicals and their changing place in our culture.", "title": "Roadshow!: The Fall of Film Musicals in the 1960s", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17847520-roadshow", "average": 3.76, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1372046132l/17847520.jpg", "reviews": 24, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/61396.Matthew_Kennedy", "name": "Matthew Kennedy"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Culture", "Music", "Media Tie In"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17847520-roadshow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1906476.Joan_Blondell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24237659-gamers-and-gods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24855757-pathspace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18897099-iced-coffee-recipes---secret-mouth-watering-recipes-for-beginners", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106079.Edmund_Goulding_s_Dark_Victory"]}
