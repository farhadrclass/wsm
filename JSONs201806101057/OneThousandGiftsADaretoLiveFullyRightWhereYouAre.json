And I guess it's become something of a Christian classic. But, this was a difficult book for me to read, and therefore difficult to get into enough to relate well to it. This was my second try. I was reading it (slowly - having the same problems getting into it) when my brother died and I just stopped reading it. After two years, and continued sightings of gushing reviews I figured it was only fair to give it another shot. It just isn't for me. I don't like most poetry either and that is likely the problem as the book is written in a mystical, image-laden, drippy, free form poetical style, with long descriptions and odd metaphors and cutesy nicknames - instead of names - for every person in her family. Glurgh. I made myself finish it this time. It took months & it's really not a very big book. It did nothing for me spiritually because it was so hard to read/relate to.I should say that I've done gratitude journals for years. That has helped me immensely over the years, both personally and spiritually. And the gratitude journal-thing is at the root of this book: listing 1000 gifts/grace notes in your life. For people who like her writing style, it is probably spiritually helpful. If you don't like her writing style, just start a gratitude journal, keep at it, and you'll be surprised how much it changes you/the way you live."}, {"userName": "Amanda Allen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6752826-amanda-allen", "userReview": "Ok. I have a lot to say about this book. I wanted to like it. I really, really did. In fact, for the first two chapters, I did. But then I started getting a headache.First things first. Things I liked about this book:1. I like the premise - that gratitude is essential to a Christian life, and that when we become aware of how much we have to be thankful for, our perspective on day-to-day mundane and stressful activities shifts.2. Voskamp is a poet. Some of the sentences are beautifully crafted.Things I did not like about this book:1. Voskamp is a poet. But this book isn't supposed to be poetry. I started getting annoyed by the flowery prose and started yearning for her to just. Say. It. I get it. The moon is beautiful. \"Eucharisteo\" (repeated about a jillion times) is great. But do you ever speak in a normal vernacular? Ever?2. She seems to hate the words \"the\" or \"my.\" Seriously:\"He's already hunched over keyboard...\"\"dishes in sink\"\"I am bell\"\"I hold the bowl in hand...\"3. She leaves \"ly\" off of almost every adverb:gentle, not gentlycareful, not carefully4. There's a weird sentence structure:\"water warm\"\"plate of cheese grated\"Yes, yes, yes. You're a poet. But it's still bad grammar.5. She hyphenates everything. Everything.God-gloryGod-ManWord-GodLove-Body6. She can't just tell us the names of anyone in her family. Once again, weird hyphenations:Farmer HusbandBoy-ManTall-GirlLittle-OneShe also speaks about and to them in some weird poetic voice. Her son is \"the child I ripened with, bore down and birthed from the heart...\" Ew. I found myself saying, \"Really? You actually asked your kid, 'can I help you find the laughter again?' after he threw a piece of toast in his brother's face instead of asking him, 'Hey, how about you don't throw toast in your brother's face?'\"7. Lastly, the final chapter was horrifying. Horrifying. This is an actual sentence: \"I fly to Paris and discover how to make love to God.\"I'm sorry. Please do not compare the love we feel for God to the joy of sex. She does. Repeatedly. Graphically. I got the heebie jeebies.All in all, I felt like this book was just some self-important drivel from someone who thinks that God's plan is for everyone to bear six children (she refers to her globe-trotting cool aunt merely as \"childless\"), live on a farm, and have time to contemplate how gorgeous sunlight hitting suds \"in sink\" is. Navel gazing at its worst, and I sort of finished the book wanting to force her to watch \"The Office\" or something so she could speak like an actual human."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3114120-christine", "userReview": "(Warning - review sent to family, not edited to protect the feelings of my friends who have read this and may like it...)I finally, just shy of 7 full months, finished One Thousand Gifts by Ann Voskamp (actually one thousand gifts, looking more closely at the cover). And there is a peak at what I despised about the book. First, however, as Dad taught me, I will say something nice. She does have some good and interesting views on living the Christian life fully, with total gratitude for what God gives you (hence looking for 1000 things for which to be grateful). Take this: \"Every moment I live, I live bowed to something. And if I don't see God, I'll bow down before something else\" (p 110). Sounds reminiscent of someone else, but still good. So, you may find the book worth reading, if only for the references to other people like CS Lewis and Henri Nouwen. Plus, she married a Dutchman, so what's not to like about that.But, for the rest - consider this my scathing pregnancy review (a la Three Cups of Tea while pregnant with Naomi). Her style of writing is so poetic, it is gagging. Her misuse of proper grammar was distracting and not inspiring. \"Yet, now wisps of cheese tell me gentle that this is the first secret step into eucharsteo's miracle\" (p 57). And this is mild, mild!, by comparison to some other sections. In one chapter she is leaving her family at the dinner table to run through their crops to try and catch the moon (?!?!). You can't imagine how long it took me to get through that section! Bleh bleh bleh. Some strange theological ideas mixed in too, but maybe I was misunderstanding her due to the extreme poetic license (and lack of an editor??). To you give you one last glimpse from the acknowledgments at the end, \"Caleb, Joshua, Hope, Levi, Malakai, Shalom, six who have swollen me, shaped me, and birthed me into love.\" Pardon while I breath into a paper bag. Anyway, feel free to chalk this up to pregnancy. But, I can't read it again later to see if it was all hormones. Someone else read it and let me know."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5477551-molly", "userReview": "What, at first, I enjoyed about this book is what eventually became tedious and labor-some. There is no question that Voskamp is adept at constructing flowery and poetic prose. Unfortunately, for my taste, her style became a bit too much to digest. While I am moved and inspired by her work's powerful message on the importance of gratitude and communion with a gracious and loving heavenly father, her delivery often kept me from truly enjoying the experience of reading what she was communicating."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4707303-michelle", "userReview": "My favorite blogger has finally written a book! Her writing style is unusual but captivating, so full of description and passion. I devoured this book in about 12 hours the first time I read it, a child running along the beach picking up shell after shell, each one prettier than the last. Then I went back and savored it more slowly, turning over the beautiful truths one at a time to be carefully thought about and applied to my everyday living. Than also read and enjoyed it, to my suprise. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9991812-steven", "userReview": "I was in my local bookstore and I saw this book recommended by the staff. I bought it on a whim. I got it home and was intrigued by Ann's style and how she she had tapped into something I had been feeling in the years following a bout with cancer...a spirit of thankfulness and knowing everything is by the grace of God. Reading through this book I realize I am not alone. Having spent a lot of time reading male writers and theology books in general, Ann is full of emotion and life. I find reading her words refreshing and at the same time overwhelming. But I am inspired by what I have read thus far. Inspired by grace, inspired to be thankful. I will never fully grasp all Ann has to offer here, because I am a man and have never experienced motherhood. Having given birth to six children and is in the process of homeschooling them--Ann draws from these experience and finds God's grace in the chaos. In this process of writing and giving thanks she finds meaning and closure of her past tragic beginnings in childhood. Butso far I am inspired by her transparency in sharing. With all of this said I'm not comfortable with everything presented in this book. In fact I find myself uncomfortable in parts because of the depth of intimacy expressed. But I can honestly say I see the same level expressed in Scripture itself (Song of Solomon) where I am also challenged. She at times approaches experiencing God with a child like faith and is at times like a young teenage girl discovering emotions for the first time...of which I can only stand back and watch with a smile. I know there is theological issues with this book and it is widely popular. I don't think Ann is trying to change theology or introducing anything new to the arena of Christian thought. She is simply writing down her experiences and in her own way. I have read the blogs that have been critical of this book and I understand their concern. But I don't know a Christian alive who can't benefit from being more thankful, more aware of God's love and grace."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/734470-danielle", "userReview": "Deeply troubling from a theological perspective. Quite often mystical, with a near wringing-out of a thesis (eucharisteo), repeated multiple times per page. Quotes pulled from all over, various denominations (and even other religions!), all mashed together in the to-her radical notion that life should be lived in thankfulness. Why is this notion so life-altering for Voskamp and the hoards of women nearly breathless in awe at this book? Is Scripture not full of God's people giving thanks in all things, no matter the circumstance? What is missing from the pulpit for these women, I wonder? Why is this so shocking in its revelation?"}, {"userName": "Debby", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1394632-debby", "userReview": "Ann Voskamp is a professing Christian woman, Canadian pig farmer's wife and mother of 6 home-schooled kids. She has struggled for most of her life with insecurity, fears, panic attacks and deep questions about the goodness of God. A friend challenged Ann to look for and write down 1000 (that's right, one thousand) gifts from God. Gifts seen in daily life; not just the undeniable good, big, bright and happy stuff, but also what is seen of God's handiwork in the midst of the mundane, the ugly, the nerve-wracking and the painful events of daily life. Euchristeo is the challenge of this book; learning to exprsss thanksgiving to God for ALL his gifts in all aspects of our life, To learn to live open to give thanks and to receive the miracle of joy in our lives, just as Jesus took the break, broke it and gave thanks and THEN the miracle took place. So it is in our daily life. To acknowledge God and the circumstances we face and to give thanks IN everything, to be emptied of self focus and to be filled with the hope joy and peace of life lived believing and thanking od in and through ti all. This is a learning process for sure. No overnight wonders here! This is a book well worth reading, and maybe needs to be read more than once to really let the message sink in. Voskamp's writing style is a bit tedious at times because she is very poetic and somewhat mystical. But don't let that drag you down or keep you finding the nuggets of truth and depth of wisdom that can be fund in a life that flows with eyes ifted up, hands open to receive and a heart willing to offer thanks in all HIs gifts to HIs children; trusting that God is only and always loving, gracious, faithful, good and wise in all He does. There is much food for thought in this book for sure! I'll be thinking through this bood for a long time."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2421473-julie", "userReview": "I can't do it. I just cannot finish this book. I know it's supposed to be deep and insightful and enlightening and life-changing, but Voskamp's writing style is so irritating that I simply don't have the energy to wade through it and try and pick up on the good, worthwhile things she has to say. It's boring and I have to force myself to read it.Also, the guilt. I cannot handle the guilt ANY MORE. I feel guilty for not wanting to read it. I feel guilty for praying about anything other than prayers of thanks. I feel guilty for being irritated and in a bad mood instead of noticing the beauty of the sunlight as it reflects through my ice water. I feel guilty for having a bad attitude about this stupid book when everyone else seems to love it. I FEEL SO GUILTY ALL THE TIME!!!I might try and read bits here and there as my friends finish going through it this summer, but I'm tired of pretending.

It is a mix between poetry and memoir. It is very emotional writing, and (as another reviewer pointed out) she breaks a lot of literary rules...so that might bother some people. The writing is at times achingly poetic...I had to read so many parts to my husband just for their sheer beauty. It is written by a Christian woman and I found it so enlightening to read about faith, trial, hope, and many other gospel topics from a fresh perspective with a different vocabulary and tradition of discussion.After reading three chapters I had so many little sticky tabs marking spots, that I ordered my own copy so that I could mark up all the breathtaking passages. Here's a few of my favorites...\"A nail is driven out by another nail; habit is overcome by habit\" Erasmus said. I look down at the pen, this pen I keep wielding, one writing her way to one thousand. This pen: this IS nothing less than the driving of nails. Nails driving out my habits of discontentment and driving in my habit of eucharisteo (giving thanks). Because that habit of discontentment can only be driven out by hammering in one iron sharper. The sleek pin of gratitude.I fill the sink with the circle of bowl, and batter floats up in suds. I wash. I see my reflection in the stainless of the tap. I know you, those seeing eyes. You're the one in dire need of time, that thing we can't buy, what we sell of ourselves to get more of what we think we want, what we sacrifice to seemingly gain. They say time is money, but that's not true. Time is life. And if I want the fullest life, I need to find the fullest time. ...God gives us time. And who has time for God?The world I live in is loud and blurring and toilets plug and I get speeding tickets and the dog gets sick on the back step and I forget everything and these six kids lean hard into me all day to teach and raise and lead and I fail hard and there are real souls that are at stake and how long do I really have to figure out how to live full of grace, full of joy--before these six beautiful children fly the coop and my mothering days fold up quiet? How do you open the eyes to see how to take the daily, domestic, workday vortex and invert it into an everyday cathedral?It's my own face that obscures the face of God. How can I help this son of mine see when I can't see? The parent must always self-parent first, self-preach before child-teach, because who can bring peace unless they've held their own peace?Remembering is an act of thanksgiving...this turn of the heart over time's shoulder to see all the long way His arms have carried. (To be honest, I have to say that I am simply jealous that there are people who can write like this! I covet the ability to write so beautifully!: )God reveals Himself in rearview mirrors. And I've an inkling that there are times when we need to drive a long, long distance, before we can look back and see God's back in the rearview mirror. Maybe sometimes about as far as Heaven--that kind of distance.And one more...though these are only a few of the MANY things I have marked with my red pencil...The quiet song of gratitude, eucharisteo, lures humility out of the shadows because to receive a gift the knees must bend humble and the hand must lie vulnerably open and the will must bow to accept whatever the Giver chooses to give.I highly recommend this book...especially if these excerpts speak to you in any way. It is a book about opening up your life to the JOY that God wants you to have. About seeing everything...EVERYTHING...He gives as the gift that it is. Good, bad, happy, sad.... To remember.....\"God is always good, and I am always loved.\""}, {"userName": "Kris Irvin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1940795-kris-irvin", "userReview": "1/3rd of the book: I LOVED her poetic prose. Gorgeous language, beautifully written, holy crap she is a writing genius, etc blah blah. 2/3rd: Huh, this is starting to bug me. Her prose is kind of getting irritating. And is it just me, or is she repeating herself an awful lot? Is anything ever really getting said? How many times can we repeat \"eucharisteo\"?3/3rd: Why am I still reading this? Oh my gosh, this is driving me insane. It's the same \"information\" as the first chapter. Yeah, it IS just toast, why can't we just have a straightforward story or example of what you are trying to say? STOP BEING SO FLOWERY. ARGH. I finished this book out of sheer stubbornness. I wanted to see if she ever told a concrete story without having random run on sentences and \"the head pounds and the blood boils\" type sentences. (Side note: I really hated how it was always \"the lungs ache,\" not \"my lungs ache.\" Drove me crazy.) Honestly, I don't feel like I really learned or got anything out of this book. I came away disappointed and frustrated. Maybe if the style had been severely toned down, I might have liked it better. But truly, it was like she just kept saying the same thing over and over and over again, and there was no resolution. Especially when she wrote about interactions with her kids (i.e. the toast story), how did that turn out? I will never know, and it bugs me. At least now I know what \"eucharisteo\" means."}, {"userName": "Denise Ballentine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4161638-denise-ballentine", "userReview": "Hard book to rate, even harder to describe. I appreciate the author's honesty. I enjoyed the glimpses into her everyday life. I do think I need daily to be conscious of God's blessings, both big and small. I do need to have more of an attitude of thankfulness and trust. Good points. There were parts of this that truly were beautiful and moving. But also, there were parts that I felt went on too long and I had to force myself through (the moon thing). I disagree with some of her assumptions, and I think her picture of God is a little off kilter, unbalanced. Some parts sounded almost like they could have come right out of Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul, another book that didn't always sit right with me. Volskamp is a talented writer, and I know many loved this book, but her bloggish, over the top writing style just doesn't do it for me. But I think I would like her if I met her in person."}, {"userName": "ChristaAnne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4438714-christaanne", "userReview": "In the positive:\u00a0I do think Voskamp is a believer and has a genuine desire to seek after God. I do not judge her heart or motives. I think she has good intentions. \u00a0I also think gratitude is definitely something we all fail to adequately put into practice. And if there is a good take away from this book, it is that we should be more aware of the blessings God has given to us and thank Him for those blessings. I don\u2019t agree with some critics that declare her a (conscious) panentheist. I can definitely see why readers might conclude that, and I could easily see her going down that path if not careful. She definitely doesn\u2019t make much of a distinction between special revelation and natural revelation in the book; however, there were hints that led me to think that in reality she probably does make a distinction--it just wasn\u2019t clearly spelled out in the book. She mentions looking through the lens of the Word--but often natural and special revelation almost seem to be on par with one another in the book. I think her romanticism and stylistic writing make her come off sounding more like a panentheist than she really is. The problem is that whether she is or isn\u2019t, when writing a book that has theological influence, being unclear or hazy is a problem. Fairly obvious theological issues:The last chapter was way beyond acceptable for me. I have no issues being drawn closer to God, but the moment sexual language is brought into describing our closeness to God I have some big issues. Yes, God is immanent, but he is also transcendent, and we have to tread cautiously when it comes to how we word things. Her language is very troubling. The whole part about her having communion with a group of ladies that got together was a blatant issue. It took me a little by surprise...all of sudden they went from washing feet to having a communion service with each other, and yeah, major issues--sacraments are not something we just do with a group of friends. God appointed ordained ministered are to administer sacraments.\u00a0There was a point in the book when her son had an hand injury due to a barn fan incident. During this incident her mom said to her that it was God\u2019s grace he didn\u2019t lose fingers. She questioned that statement in her head wondering if he had lost use of his hand would God not have been gracious then? And she concludes All is Grace. Well, that\u2019s just not true. I understand what she is hinting at: all things work together for good, and ultimately God is sovereign over the good and bad things, but concluding that \u2018All is grace\u2019 can lead to a perverted understanding of many things--judgment, sin etc. I\u2019m not saying grace isn\u2019t present in suffering...absolutely God makes himself and His grace known to us in special ways during suffering and difficulties and he works out all things for his glory and our good, but there\u2019s a difference in knowing God\u2019s grace during suffering and seeing bad things as actual grace. Death is not grace. It is the enemy. We experience God\u2019s comfort and grace as we mourn the death of others, and we experience his love and grace as we face death ourselves, but death is still the enemy and it is still a result of the fall. It kind of goes back to the question of where did sin come from? And by trying to figure it out we can easily find ourselves coming to the conclusion: God created the world and everything in it, so therefore, God must have created sin. Before you know it we have made him the author of sin, when he has clearly said the opposite. Yes, all things work out for good, but not all is grace. And just because God is making all things work for good and using us in the process does not mean that we will always understand or be aware of how God is working out all things nor will we always be aware of how God is using us to bring about his will. There are mysteries that belong to God they must be left mysteries.\u00a0Less blatant theological issues:\u00a0I think in her efforts to make her Christianity very practical, she ends up becoming impractical because it is based on a formula. In other words, she takes the task of making this huge list of things to be grateful for, but the list ends up becoming her goal more than relationship with Christ. In a twisted way it ends up being its own form of legalism.\u00a0 She becomes married to the list, and her hope is constantly tied to finding something to be grateful for instead of tied to Christ-who He is and the sacrifice He made for us. She often actually speaks of gratitude as redemptive...on pg 128 using the phrase: \u201cgratitude redeems\u201d. Gratitude doesn\u2019t redeem us any more than doing merciful acts for someone, or going to church (yes, these are all good and commendable things that are fruits of justification, but they don\u2019t redeem). It was telling to me that it isn\u2019t until page 154 that she finally clearly recognizes Christ\u2019s atonement (it is hinted at throughout, but rarely stated head on). If there\u2019s anything that should stimulate gratitude it is Christ\u2019s death and resurrection on our behalf. That should have been on page 1. We can\u2019t look at natural revelation and see grace until we have first tasted grace, forgiveness and redemption in Christ\u2019s substitutionary atonement. This ends up being a big flaw, because the average Joe (or in this case more likely Jill) reading the book will not be reading it through the lens of redeemed eyes. And to focus on just finding things in nature and life to be thankful for before grounding readers in where true grace and forgiveness come from, puts the cart in front of the horse.The decision to publish the book also gets me a little (I know this sounds weird!). The book really isn\u2019t about 1000 Gifts, and it isn\u2019t really about the God she serves, the book is really about her. American evangelicals have an addiction to this idea of being transparent to some degree or other--where they spill everything out in an effort to feel that we are all on this sanctification journey together. It\u2019s almost a badge of honor to hang out your dirty underwear, and well, if you don\u2019t it\u2019s because you\u2019re \u2018not spiritual\u2019. Now, there are definite times and places (ie in the pastor\u2019s office in a counseling session) where yes, there is definitely going to be some dirty laundry that comes out, but it comes out for a definite purpose: so that a counselor can help sort, point out where repentance is needed, and move toward restoration and growth. Lots of \u2018transparency\u2019 in churches today comes out in groups, helps us all realize that we\u2019re all the same and struggling, and often elevates intention while downplaying behavior. By this I mean for some reason it seems more ok if we sin so long as we announce our struggle and we have good intentions. So long as I didn\u2019t mean to gossip and was really just giving a prayer request then surely I can\u2019t be held responsible for the sin of gossip--after all my heart was good and I\u2019ve shared my struggle with gossip. Well intention AND action matter. Premeditated murder is definitely not the same as involuntary manslaughter, but we are still responsible for our behavior AND our intent.\u00a0 Also, transparency in most churches today is rarely connected to pointing out where repentance is needed. I mean let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not fun or easy to look at someone having their good interest at heart and genuine love and concern for them in our hearts and say, \u2018You\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re sinning and you need to repent.\u2019 Most of the time we hear things like, \u201cyeah, I struggle with that too\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s ok. We\u2019re all a work in progress\u201d or some other trite statement that does absolutely nothing for spiritual growth and development. I think there\u2019s a push for transparency yet simultaneously a lack of true humility. The thing we long for is true, honesty and humility. In the book, I think that Voskamp attempted that, but even in the situation with her son, the sin wasn\u2019t ever really addressed with him, instead it was all just about gratitude (her struggle; maybe not his) when that wasn\u2019t necessarily the real sin in the situation. Furthermore, she talks to her son about fighting a feeling with another feeling not with thinking (pg 136) Her logic here is lacking. She says it\u2019s impossible to feel thanks and feel angry. And she says we control what feelings we want to feel. Feelings are not something we control...thoughts are. And gratitude is not a \u2018feeling.\u2019 It may be accompanied by a fuzzy wuzzy, but it is the acknowledgement of blessing from God\u2019s hand. And to say that anger and gratitude don\u2019t ever co-exist is to say Christ was ungrateful when he overthrew the tables (she creates this same false dichotomy on page 126). She is trying to interject grace and gratitude into the situation, but because everything is so rooted in experience, emotion and feeling rather than Truth and thinking, she really swims around in some illogical and biblically unsound waters. Her goal is good and commendable, but she ends up saying wrong things because her theology is off. In reality we all say wrong things often. Let\u2019s face it we aren\u2019t masters of taking \u2018every thought captive,\u2019 but this would be a reason why journal type books intended to point us to Christ yet filled with a stream of consciousness probably shouldn\u2019t be published until you\u2019re dead and someone else decides it is of theological value, or at least until you have had a sound theologian scrutinize it for doctrinal errors. The reality is people are influenced by Ms. Voskamp--her blog has a bazillion followers. And the standard for someone that is writing about and speaking about theological matters is much higher than other writers/teachers.\u00a0 As I\u2019ve said, I think her heart is in the right place, but she is just theologically sloppy. And theology is not something that we can afford to be sloppy about.\u00a0One last thing...I know, I\u2019ve been pretty brutal. There were a few hints in the book that she obviously had some serious emotional issues in her life...not just her sister\u2019s death, but at one point she hinted at being suicidal. And I got the impression this book (and the 1000 gifts experiment) served as a type of therapy for her. Since she seemed to find some kind of happiness in the gratitude experiment she projects her issues (and solution) on everyone else. Granted most of us aren\u2019t grateful enough, but maybe gratitude isn\u2019t our biggest struggle. Even if I struggle with the same things she went after trying to attain an emotional experience which culminated in what she termed \u2018making love to God\u2019 (gasp!) and I just don\u2019t agree with the goal. I think the focus and goal must be Christ and Truth. When we come face to face with solid Truth and the Lord of all there will be an emotional response (at times, even often, that emotional response is less of a fuzzy feeling and more fear of God). Sometimes it might be big; other times it may seem cold and dry, but our goal shouldn\u2019t be the feeling, because there are times we are not going to \u2018feel\u2019 God the way we wish. There are times we will feel alone, tired, depressed, worthless, ashamed and everything else...but the answer is not to just say we should replace depression with joy, the answer is to fix our eyes on Christ, find our identity in Him, root our thoughts in His Word and meditate on His Word until it revives joy. \u00a0The Truth will set us free...not the feeling or experience."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/613016-maggie", "userReview": "well. it is a beautiful book. and practical spirituality is always a good part of life of which to be reminded. and the daily-thanksgiving-for-all-things is both an awesome part of life and a difficult remembering in any given moment of an uber-busy life. but sometimes me-thinks she does protest too much. it's almost a form of the old-time calvinist thought: prove you are saved ... try harder. *sigh* makes me glad to be rcc where i learned all these thoughts/ideas gradually and as i grew up and also knew that we are loved even when we fall short and when we finally remember and come back to faith/gratitude that too is good enough and we are embraced again and quietly recall that even when we were \"away\" we were still being embraced, unawares. sometimes i think the author concentrated soooo much on this control issue of daily thanksgiving that i just sort of wished she go to a movie, chill, and laugh a bit. maybe she could take up running as a way to relieve that strong build up of tension that she seems to carry around everywhere with her and sometimes uses as a cudgel against herself or others (her poor son!). but that's me. by the end of the book (not finding fault with the theology or the daily examples) i concluded that my best recommendation would be: read it slowly. small small bits at a time. b/c it's worth remembering or hearing for the first time. it's just not urgent. there's time enough. so relax the concentration of the entire book by staying with it but little bits at a time. like take an entire week to read half a chapter. the (true) wisdom that is contained in this book might actually work better that way. joy isn't meant to be a burden. and it is freely-given. and there are reliable ways to have it visit (often). but pressuring yourself to \"keep it up\" just plain exhausts the spirit. or it did for this reader engaging with this book.. another thought: taking the sacramental life of every day and working it too hard with all those words deflates the joy in True Presence, imo. that's our loss. the ideas remain strong, reliable, true. just too many words clutter up this book. first error of a writer: being in love with her own voice. best advice: slash every third word. in this case, maybe every other word. it could also be that the book is undercut by the sheer amount of self-focus. of course the book is all about her. but it wasn't until the end that i realized that paris -- a city FULL of music in various forms -- seemed to be playing just for her. uhmmmm. okay. and then i reflected back on all the words of her book as well as some of the more special experiences that she took the trouble to describe (the one with her son, the time with the homeless man, the moment of communion and feet washing with her women's group) and it came clear to me that those were exceptions to the roll of \"her moments\" and, sadly, i sensed that she sets herself apart from other people. then i recalled luke 18:9-14. she is special. and she goes out of her way to impress that upon us mere beggars at the table. *yikes* the one thing that she may not have yet figured out might be best expressed using the words of blessed teresa of calcutta: we are all the same distance from God. [saints, hard-working (grasping for good things) christians trying to prove their worthiness, AND sinners. all He needs from us is our Yes. and we don't need to repeat it. just be patient with it.]i suppose she needs 1000 (2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 ...) gifts of awareness. she certainly didn't get it with only three examples."}, {"userName": "Ebookwormy1", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005834-ebookwormy1", "userReview": "There are many books and resources available that examine deep woundedness, but few do it with the solid Biblical foundation of Ann Voskamp. Her Mennonite heritage has served her well, even when walking very dark paths.Sensitive readers will be both broken and inspired by Voskamp's memoir of her journey from grief-stricken witness of the death of her sister, self-mutilation, agoraphobia and deep emotional torment. Chapters are rich with pieces of her dark path and streams of light. Voskamp draws her healing from intimate situations of encouragement from the LORD, but also from the Bible itself and the wise, ancient wisdom of those who have walked the path of faith before. Her notes are carefully referenced in a section at the end and read like a who's who in esteemed Christendom: Augustine, Lewis, Elliot, Piper, de Cassaude, Heschel, Carmichael, Chesterton, Luther, and Julian of Norwich appear on the two pages I skimmed.Apparently, there has been some hub-bub about the final chapter \"The Joy of Intimacy\" which begins \"I fly to Paris and learn how to make love to God.\" The imagery of God as husband who intiates and believer as wife who responds is not original to Voskamp as her generous Scriptural references and quotes (Calvin can certainly not be dismissed!) indicate. The idea of God courting us, seeking us, leading and the mystical union of Christ with the Church are a fitting climax, a holy intimacy that earthly, physical intimacy is to picture. I cannot close a review of this work without commenting on Voskamp's unique poetic style. Her prose is filled with vivid pictures that sing life to the soul, and capture a deep, profound place of human experience. For me, it was best to read one chapter at a time, process what was written and then return when ready for another drink.Highly recommended.I suspect this work will become a classic from our time. It is worthy of being read for years into the future, until the Bridegroom comes to wed us forever.

Rather, life's layers seem to unveil themselves one by one, day by day.There are so many stunning words, so many metaphors, such deep abidings with God here, that I scarce know where to begin.

It's about being grateful, even amidst the stress of every day life, and how that can change your perspective and bring you closer to God. It has a great message - found myself jotting certain phrases down while I was listening. Her writing is not great though, which is why this book only gets 3 stars. There were times when I thought she'd made a great point, and she'd end on that. Instead she'd go on to say the same thing again about 15 different ways, and I'd feel like the point almost gets lost in the extra 5 minutes of reading.

Aimee was chasing a cat and ran out into the road. The driver said he never saw her in the road. Her mother witnessed the accident. Ann has vivid memories of her mother sitting on the front porch rocking her little sister while the blood seeped through the quilt she was wrapped in. The description of the accident that caused Aimee's death begins the book \"One Thousand Gifts\".Ann becomes a Christian when she is 16, but is haunted by her continued grief and inability to get past the death of her sister. Images of blood soaking through quilts appear frequently. This one event in her life has scarred her family forever. Her father stopped going to church after Aimee died. Her mother was in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. Ann herself even seems to have struggled with cutting herself. Ann eventually marries a farmer in Canada, settles down to being a farmer's wife, and rears 6 children. Through it all, Ann struggles with wanting to live a full Christian life, not full of anger or bitterness, not focused always on the evil and wickedness in life. Her son Levi has an accident in the barn and needs surgery on his hand. While taking him to the hospital, Ann hears of a young Mennonite farmer boy who was killed in an accident on the farm. Ann also remembers the tragic illness and death of two of her nephews from an unusual genetic disease. She marvels that her brother-in-law accepts the grief and still praises God for having had the boys at all. Sorrow, death, tragedy surround all things. How do you live in the middle of this? Ann comes up with a practice to change her heart from being angry and bitter and to focus her thoughts on being thankful to the Lord. She focuses on \"eucharisteo\", thanksgiving to God. She begins making a list of \"1000 things that she loves\" and thanking God for them. She keeps a journal and writes down any and every item that she sees that she loves. Entries are written much like William Carlos William poems. \"Morning shadows across the old floors\". \"Jam piled high on the toast\". \"Cry of blue jay from high in the spruce\". \"Laundry flapping\". \"Click of a seat belt\". \"Book pages turning\". \"Boys humming hymns\". The practice of being thankful for these things listed heals her heart and softens her life. Being thankful literally changes her life, and allows her to live with joy. By the end of the book she is able to go to Aimee's gravestone and be thankful for her sister, even though she doesn't understand why Aimee died.I applaud Ann for being a farmer's wife, Lord knows we need more of them. I also applaud Ann for her 6 children, who are blessings to her at all times in the book. I am also happy that she homeschools her children, what a great education for all involved. However, I have to admit this book made me tired. Ann's style of writing is very poetic. She invents new word phrases to capture special nuances, and to me it makes the sentences stumble. It jars and does not read well either silently or aloud. I found myself scanning to the next paragraph hoping to get back to something concrete instead of wading through prose trying to be poetry. I agree totally with Ann's habit of thanksgiving to the Lord. I agree that being thankful to Jesus for small things helps heal the horrific slashes and cuts of wickedness and evil in the world. But at the end of the book, I am left wondering, \"what happened to Ann's mother?\". If Ann's practice of thanksgiving helped her, I wonder if it helped her mother?"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4075354-beth", "userReview": "Sometimes when a book's reviews offer such polarizing takes on it, I am hesitant to pick it up. However, when a trust friend here on Goodreads read it and loved it, my curiosity peaked again. Then, it popped up as a Kindle deal, so I grabbed it. Now, I'm both glad that I did and thinking I'm crazy for waiting so long to read it.I can see how some readers may not love the writing style. It's very lyrical and poetic in nature, which doesn't suit everyone. Even though I tend to love that type of writing, I did find some of the sentences to have too much run-on, the metaphors a bit overwhelming, when perhaps a single word would have sufficed and held just as much impact. On the whole, though, my soul craves this type of writing, this making of beauty in the mundane of life. I so tire of the \"hey, girlfriend, grab yourself a latte, and let me tell you how special you are!\" type of books. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with those books. I read and get a lot out of them, but there is a sameness about some of them that leave me craving authenticity and creativity.Ann's words soaked into my parched soul, pointing me to the gospel in a refreshing, soul-stirring way. I've been prompted to start my own one thousand gifts list. So often, we focus on the negative instead of focusing on all of the ways, even the seemingly insignificant ways, that God shows Himself to us. Her admiration of God's creation always leads her back to worship of Him and communion with Him. If there's any reminder I need nearly every moment of every day, it's this one. That it's hard to hold onto joy when gratitude isn't present but resentment is. That gratitude begets joy and more gratitude, and yes, life is hard, but God is still good and joy is still there for the taking because of His goodness.I highlighted many lines and passages in my Kindle, and I'll definitely be looking for a hard copy of this book for my shelves.

I love descriptive writing but I guess I was hoping for more of a conversational piece mother to mother. I felt like it was less of a \"dare\" and more a lengthy monologue offlowery words.

Beautiful writing but she is wrong and unbiblical in many of her musings. I agree with the overall theme that we should give thanks to God in all circumstances. 1 Thessalonians and other verses make this clear. However, that thankfulness is not salvation, and the fall was so much more than a result of \"ungratefulness\" to God, as she she seems to claim. And so much more that she states just resonated as wrong to me.

I will re-visit this book, I think... I'm glad I read it and bought it... The writing style does bug me, so I take it in little doses... So I give it 5 stars for thoughts and insights, 3 or 2.5 for irritating, inconsistent, idiosyncratic, annoying grammar! I first heard of Voskamp several years ago when I was looking for a read aloud geography book for my daughter, for home school. Voskamp is a homeschooler herself. We loved that book and read it through. I have been reading One Thousand Gifts s-l-o-w-l-y. It is that kind of book. I love the ideas Voskamp writes about. To find joy in little things, even hard things... trials, inconveniences.. yes, there are blessings in everything. I took the book out of the library at first, but then realized I wanted to underline and highlight a lot, so I bought the book and am now still highlighting and underlining thoughts.. A lot of goodreads reviewers criticized Voskamp's writing style. And when I saw these criticisms it hindered me a bit, made me wonder if I want to bother w/reading it. I'm glad I did, but I do agree w/the criticisms. Voskamp's writing style, at least in this book, is over the top poetic, and frankly it gets irritating. And what's worse, from this grammar nerd's perspective, her inconsistencies bug the heck out of me.. for ex... her misuse of adjectives for adverbs... \"I touched his cheek soft.\" She leaves out articles. Here and there, not always.. just often enough to bother me. \"Son goes to window.\" Now I wouldn't mind it much but she doesn't do this consistently throughout the book. And so if I were the editor I'd say, 'make up your mind which way ya want to go lady.\" Either keep the idiosyncratic style throughout the book or hang it up... despite the technique issues, I do find her thoughts inspiring and I will finish this one...."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/728681-samantha", "userReview": "*A dare to live fully right where you are*This book was sent to me courtesy of DaySpring.I had a feeling that it would impact my life but I wasn't ready for the soul-shaking, eye-opening change it would produce.I read through slowly, bit by bit, savoring each morsel of truth.I found my self identifying with Ann even though my life's tragedies weren't identical with hers.As I read, I prayed and God spoke to my heart.

When we are despairing, we can choose to live as Israelites gathering manna. For forty long years, God's people daily eat manna--a substance whose name literally means 'What is it?' Hungry, they choose to gather up that which is baffling. . . . MOre than 14,600 days they take their daily nourishment from that which they don't comprehend. They find soul-filling in the inexplicable. They eat the mystery. They eat the mystery. And the mystery, that which made no sense, is 'like wafers of honey' on the lips (21-22).\"On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces . . . .\" (1 Corinthians 11:23-24).\"Jesus offers thanksgiving for even that which will break Him and crush Him and wound Him and yield a bounty of joy (chara)\" (36).\u201cNow in the Bible a name . . . reveals the very essence of a thing, or rather its essence as God\u2019s gift. . . .

To name a thing, in other words, is to bless God for it and in it\u201d (Schmemann, For the Life of the World, 15, quoted on page 53).\u201c. . . I discover that slapping a sloppy brush of thanksgiving over everything in my life leaves me deeply thankful for very few things in my life. A lifetime of sermons on \u2018thanks in all things\u2019 and the shelves sagging with books on these things and I testify: life-changing gratitude does not fasten to a life unless nailed through with one very specific nail at a time. Little nails and a steady hammer can rebuild a life\u2014eucharisteo precedes the miracle\u201d (57).\u201cI know there is poor and hideous suffering, and I\u2019ve seen the hungry and the guns that go to war. I have lived pain, and my life can tell: I only deepen the wound of the world when I neglect to give thanks . . . [for] all the good things that a good God gives. Why would the world need more anger, more outrage? How does it save the world to reject unabashed joy when it is joy that saves us? Rejecting joy to stand in solidarity with the suffering doesn\u2019t rescue the suffering. The converse does. The brave who focus on all things good and all things beautiful and all things true, even in the small, who give thanks for it and discover joy even in the here and now, they are the change agents who bring the fullest Light to all the world\u201d (58).\u201cThis thanks for the minute, this is to say the prayer of the most blessed of women about to participate in one of the most transformative events the world has ever known. Mary, with embryonic God Himself filling her womb, exalts in quiet ways: \u2018My soul doth magnify the Lord\u2019\u201d (59).\u201cThis act of naming grace moments, this list of God\u2019s gifts, moves beyond . . . into the other side of prayer, the interior of His throne room, the inner walls of His powerful, love-beating heart. The list is God\u2019s list, the pulse of His love\u2014the love that thrums on the other side of our prayers. And I see it now for what this really is, this dare to write down one thousand things I love. It really is a dare to name all the ways that God loves me\u201d (59).\u201cOn every level of life, from housework to heights of prayer, in all judgment and efforts to get things done, hurry and impatience are sure marks of the amateur\u201d (Evelyn Underhill, 66).\u201cHurry always empties a soul\u201d (67).\u201cTime is a relentless river.

I have hacked my life into grace moments and curse moments\u201d (100).\u201cGod is always good and I am always loved. Everything is eucharisteo. Because eucharisteo is how Jesus, at the Last Supper, showed us to transfigure all things\u2014take the pain that is given, give thanks for it, and transform it into a joy that fulfills all emptiness. I have glimpsed it: This, is the hard eucharisteo. The hard discipline to lean into the ugly and whisper thanks to transfigure it all to beauty. . . . All is grace only because all can transfigure\u201d (100-101).\u201cI\u2019ve got to get this thing, what it means to trust, to gut-believe in the good touch of God toward me, because it\u2019s true\u201d (146).\u201cHow can I trust when a troubled, joy-shriveled heart has pumped fear through the stiff veins of all my years?\u201d (146).\u201cHow would eucharisteo help me trust?\u201d (147).\u201cThis living a lifestyle of intentional gratitude became an unintentional test in the the trustworthiness of God\u2014and in counting blessings I stumbled upon the way out of fear\u201d (151).\u201cThe sun sets and He has provided and you\u2019ve ate. Tomorrow the sun will rise and again He will provide. You will eat bread again\u201d (quoted on page 157-158).Eucharisteo is \u201ctrusting what is received to be grace. Taking it as bread\u201d (158).\u201cHe knew I\u2019d only trust, rest, when I lived with bread in hand. When I eat manna\u201d (158).\u201cEucharisteo, remembering with thanks, this is the bread. We take the moments as bread and give thanks and the thanks itself becomes bread. The thanks itself nourishes. Thanks feeds our trust\u201d (158).\u201cthis glorious laugh, the laugh of the unafraid and the bold, the giddy hope of the bread carriers, the manna eaters\u201d (158).\u201cFor really, as long as I live, travel, is there ever anything else to eat? I either take the \u2018what is it\u2019 manna with thanks, eat the mystery of the moment with trust, and am nourished another day\u2014or refuse it . . . and die\u201d (158).\u201cWe can trust . . . in the manna nourishment even when we don\u2019t know what it is\u201d (159).\u201c . . . that lyrical laugh, heaven\u2019s echo that entirely undoes me\u201d (160).\u201cEucharisteo always precedes the miracle, child\u201d (160).\u201c . . . what I feel for this daughter He feels for me, and the gifts, all these gifts I keep counting, they are His love gifts and they\u2019re slowly waking me up to the tenderest, fiercest Love of all\u201d (161).\u201cWell, theories and theology stillbirth unless they can take on some skin, breathe in the polluted air of this world, and make it happen\u201d (174).\u201cLament is a cry of belief in a good God, a God who has His ear to our hearts, a God who transfigures the ugly into beauty. Complaint is the bitter howl of unbelief in any benevolent God in this moment, a distrust in the love-beat of the Father\u2019s heart\u201d (175).\u201cGod\u2019s anger kindles hot when the essence of the complaint implies doubt in His love . . . . Lament is this long learning, hard like eucharisteo\u201d (175).Lament is \u201ccomplaint that trusts his heart\u201d unlike \u201cIsraelite complaint\u201d which doubts His love (175).\u201cEucharist is the state of the perfect man. Eucharist is the life of paradise. Eucharist is the only full and real response of man to God\u2019s creation, redemption, and gift of heaven\u201d Alexander Schmemann\u201cI think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation\u201d (C.S. Lewis quoted on 201).These are the paraphrases that Alexis sent my way after she read it in Spring 2013:Gratitude is a memory of God\u2019s heart and to thank is to remember God.

I took about a year and a half to read this. But I have to say that the writing was absolutely beautiful and so poetic. This was a really insightful read."}, {"userName": "Rosemary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10392978-rosemary", "userReview": "Convoluted grammar is neither poetry nor poetic prose. I wonder if Ann Voskamp would write that sentence this way: \"Grammar convoluted is not poetry or prose poetic.\" In spite of unending grammatical error, I kept reading. Why? I liked her premise: Being thankful is healthy and scriptural. Finding beauty and meaning in the little things is something that I can get into and celebrate. I wanted to like the book; there were many parts of the book which I did like. The problem for me is that, in my background--back in the 1970s and 80s, I spent some time studying* how mysticism and New Age philosophy were creeping into Christianity. Thirty years later, it's running rampant, and Christian women are lapping it up in books, conferences, and blogs. While Ann tries to make incorrect grammar seem like poetry, she also seems to succeed in making New Age philosophy seem like Christianity. Judging by her popularity and all of the 5 stars that I see on Goodreads from Christian friends of mine, I guess she succeeds at that!I don't know if Voskamp is aware of the un-Biblical New Age thoughts that run like a thread through this work. I'm not sure that this was her intention. Whatever the answer to that might be, it's there! For that reason, there is no way that I can give this book a high rating. In fact, I couldn't give it even two stars because that means \"it's okay,\" but the New Age belief system that cunningly creeps into this book is not okay.If my friends who love this get mad at me for this review, consider this sentence from the book: \"I fly to Paris and discover how to make love to God.\" Really? And you think I should give this more than one star? Granted, this is one sentence taken out of context. But what context can possibly justify that sentence? It's not okay! It is New Age at best and blasphemy at worst. *You might be asking, \"What makes you an authority on this?\" (I hope that my answer will show that I'm not just a person with an opinion but that I'm able to back up my opinions with facts. I'm able to differentiate between what is Christian/biblical and what is Hindu/New Age.) My Answer: I wouldn't say I'm an authority, but I am knowledgeable. When I was studying in seminary in the early 70s, I had the privilege of taking a full-semester course entitled Christian Mysticism and the Occult with Dr. John Newport, who later wrote this book, which is \"the book,\" on this subject: The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue. Then, in the 80s, I took two fabulous week-long workshops with one of the best teachers of comparative religions in the world at that time, Dr. Maurice Smith. First, I took \"Hinduism and Hindu-based Cults,\" and I went on to become certified to speak and teach on that topic. Certification required that I spend many hours respectfully conversing with people of the Hindu religion. Since I was working with internationals on a college campus at that time, this wasn't hard to accomplish. (I'm thankful that God, in His divine plan for me, made it possible for me to receive this instruction and have these conversations.) The second workshop was \"The New Age Religion,\" which, by the way, has its roots in Hinduism. Since that time, I have remained interested and have continued to read extensively on these topics in the years following the above studies."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126876-carolyn", "userReview": "First of all: (spoiler alert!!) his name is Darryl. How many blog posts have I read and how many pictures have I seen? Finally, on the last page I stumbled across his name. Who is this Darryl? Ah, The Farmer has a name. Much closure . . .Second: \"Then sudden, thrum out of nothing, a ruby-jeweled hummingbird.\" Beautiful prose throughout this book. Voskamp is a gifted writer.Third: My general impression of the book is positive. The power of gratitude in a life cannot be underestimated, it appears. I really appreciated the practical savoring of moment as a means of enjoying God and life to the fullest. Amen sister! I need more of that. Phillipians 4:8 \"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.\" That said, there were times in the book that I felt like Voskamp was suggesting we are saved through our thanksgiving. The theme is explored to such a degree that she seems to be creating a eucharisteo theology.I also do not think that \"all is grace.\" I believe there are truly curse moments that do not need to be called grace. Grace is \"unmerited favor.\" Cancer, death, affliction, abuse are effects of the fall - in my book those are curse moments. This not a discussion of semantics - Voskamp is calling every single thing, good and bad, grace. She argues that the hard ugly things work to transfigure us therefore those things are God's grace. I get the point she is making and was challenged in my thinking but disagree with her. I like how Keller puts it in The Reason for God: \"Therefore, though Christianity does not provide the reason for each experience of pain, it provides deep resources for actually facing suffering with hope and courage rather then bitterness and despair.\"The last chapter also gave me pause. The chapter begins, \"I fly to Paris and discover how to make love to God.\" Ehhh. I have a hard time even typing that. I understood the what she was saying, us being the bride of Christ and all, but still, it was too much for me. Also, how does a man read this? As most people think of God as male, would a man enjoy the idea \"intimate pursuit, passionate love\" from God? Creeped me out, honestly. This chapter also got a little too mystical for me going on about our union with God. I understand that God is in me from the point of salvation and I am in Him - not at the point of this wishy-washy blessings back and forth business. I could go on but need to stop - am clearly in need of getting back into a book group. Voskamp coming to speak at Wheaton in late October - hope I can make it . . ."}], "description": "Just like you, Ann Voskamp hungers to live her one life well.
