I could feel that coal dust over and in every inch of my body. The differences in lifestyles both in different eras and within the same time frame are vividly told. I wasn\u2019t that eager to read about the civil war, but it and its aftermath was told so well, I thought.There\u2019s a map in the inside cover pages that shows the locations in Canada and the U.S. of the journey undertaken.By the end of the book, I was near tears because of the heartwarming friendship between two people who lived more than one hundred years apart from one another.It\u2019s a very satisfying story. Aspects of the time travel part of the story were particularly creative and unique. The characters were interesting and I was happy to get to know them.I read this for the International Book Club (in October the country is Canada!) over at the Children's Books group. It was an excellent choice, even though I want to read most of the other nominated books too.Upping this from 4 to 5 stars. I was vacillating between the two choices at the time I originally wrote this review. I just read an author interview with this author that appears in the back of some editions of this book, and I realized just how powerful this book is. I initially rated it 4 stars, I think, because it was so painful for me re the issues around loss and (not) belonging."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/446464-kathryn", "userReview": "Loved it!!! Reading this book was a truly delicious experience. Sometimes a reader just \"clicks\" with an author's style. I knew from the first few pages that I was smitten with Ms. Lunn's wordweaving and it was this, almost more than the story itself, that truly captivated me about this book.But the story is a good one! The blending of history (War Between the States) and fantasy (a modern girl is able to travel from present-day to the 1860s via a magical root cellar) could have been a disaster--but Lunn manages to pull it off. The changes in time and place (1980s Canada, 1860s Canada--1980s New York, 1860s New York, Virginia, Washington DC) could have also proven a huge burden for a less skilled author, but, again, it all manages to work here. The \"silly\" little concerns of youth (that are, none the less, immensely important in that moment!) are handled with sensitivity--as are the heart-wrenching accounts of wartime as childhood is robbed from the young soldiers. And while the causes of the war were perhaps a bit too simplified, and President Lincoln portrayed a tad too saintly, overall I think it's a fine piece of historical fiction--but could be read simply as a good story, too. The characters are all vivid, the descriptions are fabulous (especially the lovely Canadian countryside), and there's a hint of romance and a lot of adventure. I also think this is a good choice for young people struggling with finding a sense of belonging, whether it be to a new city or a new family (foster kids, adoptions, etc.)At heart, it's about growing up, learning what you believe in, where you belong... becoming the sort of person you want to be, even though, as our heroine says, it's HARD to be a person sometimes! It's not easy, but ultimately friendship gets us through.I'm so grateful to the Children's Book Group for introducing me to this Canadian author! I'll definitely look for more from the talented pen of Janet Lunn."}, {"userName": "Quirkyreader", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5355311-quirkyreader", "userReview": "I read this story when it first was published."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42315986-hilary", "userReview": "Rose, twice orphaned goes to live with her Aunt, Uncle and cousins.

Even after a few decades have passed I still vividly remember the images it invoked in me as I read it so I opted to read it again for my 2015 Reading Challenge.This book has a lot going on for such a short book. It's a historical fiction read for children with some fantasy (hence the time travel) plus action and adventure. There were a couple of times when I was on the edge of my seat (especially near the end - wow!). Overall, The Root Cellar is a sweet coming of age story of a plucky young orphaned girl and her deep friendship with two people from the past.The magic behind this book is Lunn's writing style which has a very easy going vibe to it. While the pace of the book is rather slow (with some action thrown in here and there) it's her characters and descriptions of the settings that make the book feel authentic. I think part of that has to do with her great use of the speech and vocabulary that was used during both eras that Rose lives in. Lunn's descriptions of Rose's time (1960's Canada) and the United States in the 1860's were vivid and a big part of why this book has stayed with me. It felt authentic and like you were there with Rose but her descriptions of post American Civil War didn't hold back any punches. They're not gory but there is quite a bit of emotion regarding the state of soldiers and how these boys and men find out the devastating truth about war and how they were treated post-war.The friendship that Rose has with Susan and Will was strong yet sweet but it was the ups and downs that Rose and Susan face on their adventure that felt the most real to me. Friendship isn't all 'rainbows and unicorns' and Lunn provides a very accurate description of the different sides of friendship.This was once again a great read and a Canadian classic for tweens. While my 11 year old self would still give this book a 5 star rating, this *ahem* 40-something year old book reviewer thinks that it's more of a 4 star. Still a great read with simple dialogue that deals with the effects of war, friendship, family, loss and finding our own way to belong.Note: Some editions provide a rather lengthy and informative interview with the author which I quite enjoyed.My Rating: 4/5 stars** This book review can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) where I also share my favourite 'tried and true' recipes. **"}, {"userName": "Salma", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/722636-salma", "userReview": "This was my favorite book when I was twelve.

This review is also available on my blog, Read Till Dawn.I feel like I would have liked this one a lot better if I'd read it for the first time when I was younger.It's not so much that it's geared for younger kids (in fact, it's kind of too gruesome for little children), but that the plot feels sort of . . . wobbly. On one hand it's a really cool concept, and it imparts a lot of history without being too painful, but on the other it relies on unrealistic characters and events to carry it on its way.Rose is the worst offender when it comes to being an unrealistic character. She is, to put it in a single word, unpredictable. And not in the cool, the-author-did-this-on-purpose sort of way. No, she just up and completely changes halfway through the book for no reason other than \"she went back in time, so she suddenly went from being an inhibited, emotionally-constrained doll-like girl to a headstrong, determined firecracker with a strong mind of her own.\" It's not that I dislike either side of her character, but I just don't like the way she so radically changes with no real impetus.The other main thing I found confusing about the book was that it was set in Canada . . . but was about the American Civil War. And by the end, when I'd figured everything out, it was a really cool angle - I'd never known that Canadians came to fight in the war! - but it took me way too long to figure out the basic facts: that Rose is American, and that she's living with her relatives in Canada near the American-Canadian border. For a while, I honestly thought that Rose was Canadian and her relatives were the Americans. I think part of that confusion comes from the fact that Lunn grew up in America, but moved to Canada at eighteen and lived the rest of her life there: there's no real sense of an American identity for Rose to contrast against that of her relatives from Canada, because the author was a member of both countries and didn't herself differentiate between the two. That must be it, because that's the only reason I can think of for the rather muddled distinction between the two nationalities.I did enjoy the book, though - it was a good feel-good read (except for the gruesome battle descriptions, of course). I can't see myself going out of my way to recommend it in the future, but I'm sure there are some readers out there who would be perfect for this odd little time-travel novel.

I had no desire to pick up my current read, The Blind Man of Seville, so I wandered around my home library and pulled The Root Cellar, by Janet Lunn, off the shelf and just started reading.It really wasn\u2019t what I had expected \u2013 not that I had heard of the book or really knew what it was about, aside from a root cellar and a young girl. Right when I thought I wasn\u2019t going to be reading more books about time travel, here I read about a young girl, Rose, who was left orphaned by her parents, thus going to live with an Aunt she never met.Feeling like she wasn\u2019t fitting in with her new family, Rose takes off to discover her new home only to find a root cellar. She goes down the steps and all of a sudden she\u2019s in a different time. She meets new friends, Susan and Will, and when Will goes off to fight in the war, she helps Susan go to find him when they assume he\u2019s hurt somewhere.This is definitely not one of those children books that adults can get a lot out of, in my opinion. I found it to be really sappy in areas and quite unbelievable. I had my doubts that Rose could actually go back in time and pass off as a boy and do all the things she managed to do, especially since she came from a life of being spoiled and not having to do any manual labour.It was a quick, light read.The illustrations were nice, but unnecessary. The placement of them was quite off \u2013 even though it\u2019s obvious that the girls will find Will, there is an illustration placed many pages before the reader even gets to that part, of Susan and Will embracing. Um, ruin the story, much?In the end, Rose learns valuable lessons about friendship and what it means to find your place in the world.Though, if you\u2019re looking for books about time travel, I would recommend the Outlander series, or The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife, especially if you\u2019re an adult looking for a good read."}, {"userName": "Gale", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17664194-gale", "userReview": "\"Timely Sacrifices for Friendship\"\tSlipping back and forth between the present (1960\u2019s Canada) andthe past (American Civil War 1860\u2019s) may sound exciting, but it offers more challenges and danger, as well as rewards, than the young protagonist ever imagined.

But when Rose's grandmother also dies, Rose is sent to live with her father's sister in Canada.

Feeling alone and unsure of herself, Rose discovers an old root cellar on the farm, which she explores. When she emerges from the cellar, she finds herself on the same farm but in the 1860's.

The plot actually had me a bit worried about how Rose would get back to her own time, and the ending was so sweet."}, {"userName": "Rusty", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3379953-rusty", "userReview": "Some books are so good that when I discover them I wonder why no one else has written about them. This was one of them.It's the story of a twelve-year-old girl whose parents died, who lived with her grandmother who dies and is put into the home of her father's sister in Canada. The transition is difficult for Rose. She finds the new life beyond anything she dreamed. She had been living with her grandmother in hotels, traveling and eating out for most of her meals. Suddenly, she is one in a family of several, unwanted and resentful. Through time travel she finds who she is and a way into her new family. It's a good, good read."}], "description": "Twelve-year-old orphan Rose, sent to live with unknown relatives on a farm in Canada, ventures into her aunt's root cellar and finds herself making friends with people who lived on the farm more than a century earlier.", "title": "The Root Cellar", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632838.The_Root_Cellar", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1476945638l/632838.jpg", "reviews": 121, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/189239.Janet_Lunn", "name": "Janet Lunn"}], "type": ["Historical", "Science Fiction", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632838.The_Root_Cellar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1883571.The_Root_Cellar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1883567.The_Root_Cellar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/836554.The_Root_Cellar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1883569.The_Root_Cellar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/831791.A_Rebel_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630554.The_Hollow_Tree", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630549.Shadow_in_Hawthorn_Bay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/836558.Twin_Spell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6021582-the-unexplained", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies"]}
