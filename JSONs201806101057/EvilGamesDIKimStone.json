Angela Marsons followed up her first D.I. Kim Stone book with something that is even better, I honestly did not think that was possible. This book makes for fantastic reading and officially Angela is up there with my top crime writers world wide without a doubt. Stunning work! I didn't think she could top the first book but she has. Where do I start with this one? Let me lay the foundations for you first:When a rapist is found mutilated in a brutal attack, Detective Kim Stone and her team are called in to bring a swift resolution. But, as more vengeful killings come to light, it soon becomes clear that there is someone far more sinister at work.With the investigation quickly gathering momentum, Kim soon finds herself exposed to great danger and in the sights of a lethal individual undertaking their own twisted experiment.Up against a sociopath who seems to know her every weakness, for Detective Stone, each move she makes could be deadly. As the body count starts to mount, Kim will have to dig deeper than ever before to stop the killing. And this time - it\u2019s personal.The plot in this book was breathtakingly clever, it had me on the edge of me seat, nerves jangling at times, waiting for what comes next. This is what you call a true page turner, no doubt about it. For me the book is crime fiction but has a mix of psychological thriller mixed in, totally perfect combination. Brilliant, just brilliant writing, taut, intelligent, readable, suburb. I love, love, love D.I. Kim Stone even more, she is so bloody flawed herself which makes her role so interesting. She is not a cardboard cutout cop like many crime books have, she is different, she has her own demons and they don't always stay away on the job. In this book more of her is revealed as she goes head to head with a sociopath that is relentless. She is one exceptionally written character that is growing as the series progresses. I loved her even more in this book than the first.This book outlines (scarily) the manipulation and evil that a true Sociopath is, what a character you are going to love to hate. I am not even going to tell you who the character is, just that again, terribly well developed and interesting. Angela Marsons has a knack for making her characters really \"pop\" out of the book. The plot is fantastic, it's intriguing and different from the start, can't recall a crime book like it in recent years, I loved turning the pages to find it was taking me around yet another corner. With the right amount of red herrings thrown in to make you think you have bits of it worked out, you will be hanging on to your hat by the last few chapters.The book has some disturbing scenes, some emotional scenes, some horrific scenes (nothing to really freak out about), but it gives the book a tense darkness that I absolutely loved. No light and fluffy stuff here, we are getting into the psyche of the human mind and shining a torch in every single corner. Absolutely brilliant reading, could not fault it. Some scenes had me holding my breath.A winner yet again for talented author Angela Marsons, who was just BORN to write these books, why did she take so long? I cannot wait for book three, I am a huge fan. Five huge paw prints from Booklover Catlady. You cannot go wrong with this one. Just read it. Trust me.

We were on the edge of our seats rooting for our favourite detective. \u00a0That's not the only case Kim was working on as upon opening the book we were quickly introduced to Kim and her team capturing a despicable and disgusting child molester. \u00a0A case that appears to be solved but of course there is more here than meets the eye! \u00a0\u00a0ANGELA MARSONS delivers another complex and layered story here and has created a scary mind-blowing sociopath who is such a good character that we disliked so much but on the other-hand loved. \u00a0What an awesome and complex villain she made. \u00a0\u00a0DI Kim Stone continues to fascinate us and has us laughing out loud with her wicked sense of humor. We enjoyed getting to know her a little more and were heartbroken as we learned more about her dark sad past. We loved how Marsons gave us a glimpse of Kim\u2019s soft side and vulnerable side as we could see her reactions and feelings as she related to and cared for the victims in her cases. \u00a0After being off our game for Silent Scream, we all had our game on going into Evil Games and we were all ready for the twists and turns. \u00a0We all started out strong with Brenda picking up on Alex\u2019s evil games first and Norma and Kaceey right behind piecing things together. \u00a0Kaceey figuring out the big reveal early on with Norma right behind her picking up on one of the major clues while Brenda was twirling around in left field by herself. \u00a0With some confusion on all the sisters parts we were able to piece together who done it (not twirling Brenda) and our sociopaths's games making us all feeling quite proud of our gameplay. \u00a0Sure made for some interesting and fun discussions. \u00a0\u00a0We are definitely keeping our game on and are looking forward to the action-packed race against time as DI Stone tackles her next case in book three.

The year is not even half over and we have not one, but two brilliant books from this incredible new thriller writer. I was hoping Evil Games would be close in excellence to Silent Scream. Darned if it isn\u2019t better.Evil Games grabbed me right from the first sentence (not kidding) and held me tight until the end. First of all, what a perfect title you have given this novel, Ms. Marsons. The bad people in this book are truly despicable; the \u201cgames\u201d they play are beyond contempt. I hated these people (this is good). In contrast, I was so happy to revisit the ultra complex Detective Inspector Kim Stone and her partner Bryant. We are also treated to a deeper look into Kim\u2019s past; she is a hard nut to crack and can come off as not at all likeable, though she is highly respected by her colleagues. Despite her lack of social skills, I love her as well as the nonromantic relationship she has with Bryant. It was also affirming to see the touching relationships Kim was able to develop with a couple of minor characters. The premise of the book is unique and very cerebral; I was simply fascinated. I developed goosies when it became apparent that Ms. Marsons was setting up a battle between two very strong, highly intelligent women. And what a battle it is! The author must have researched extensively to get it right. Major props for that, Ms. Marsons. Major props.The prose is not complex, which is generally what I like in a thriller. This along with the short chapters propels the story along at a rapid pace, befitting the high-caliber thriller it is. I do not want to delve any further into the storyline as it is best to go into this book cold.So who is this Angela Marsons? Angela Marsons is a British author who is now a heavy hitter in the crime fiction/thriller genre. If you have not yet read Silent Scream, read it. Read it now. Then read Evil Games. You will not be sorry. I cannot wait for the next book in this exceptional series.Angela Marsons. Do. Not. Forget. This.

But, you can't help but love this villain in this ever -so -dark and brilliant read! I definitely grew to love Kim and her team. Kim is strong and amazing detective stopping at nothing to solve her cases and get closure for her victims. I am SUPER obsessively excited to move forward with this series and to book 3!

This is a mystery crime/psychological thriller, that will have you flipping the pages, to see what will happen next.In Evil Games, we continue the journey of DI Kim Stone and her squad of detectives, the interaction of her team, while they are solving crimes. Kim and her team worked on a variety of cases from assault to sexual crimes to murder. The title of the book is so appropriate for this novel.This book is a Game of playing Cat and Mouse! DI Kim Stone takes on this game against Dr. Alexandra Thorne, two very intelligent woman, toying each other.\u201cWhen a rapist is found mutilated in a brutal attack, Detective Kim Stone and her team are called in to bring a swift resolution.

I love the character in Kim, and like that she is human with human faults and emotions. While we get to see a glimpse of her troubled past, we can accept it and her. I will continue to root for her in the coming series.All I can say is I LOVED IT! One is one of the best crime thrillers I've read in a long time.

I believe this one was even better than the first. What makes this series so completely disturbing and horrifying to me is how realistic it is. Sure, as a work of fiction there are some artistic licenses. Overall, I think this series has me looking over my shoulder wondering who I can trust. Kim Stone joins us again after capturing a disgusting child abuser that should be cut and dry, but a few of the facts just aren't adding up. Simultaneously, a rapist is murdered and Stone's team make an arrest that also seems cut and dry. However, the deeper Kim digs, the more she realizes she is up against something far more disturbing and dangerous. As connections are made, Kim will risk her life to put a sociopath behind bars while dealing with her own issues that she has fought so hard to keep buried. This one was interesting because we find out early on in both storylines who the \"culprit\" is, if you will. I was concerned this would take away from the suspense and mystery of the novel but it did not. There were still many twists and turns I did not see coming which always adds to a reading experience IMO. Overall, another disturbing and well crafted thriller from Angela; I'm eagerly anticipating starting #3 later this week!"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "WoWzers!!My house turned into complete darkness with only the light from my ipad leading me through the final chapters of this one. I lost all sense of the day......Evil Games is the second book in the DI Kim Stone Series by Angela Marsons. As the series unfolds, book by book, we are given more and more insight into the backstory of Kim. Although a stellar investigating detective, Kim bears the deep scars of her childhood. There is much to observe in this serious, no-nonsense, black clad individual. She has an uncanny sixth sense and her acute analytical nature sees what others fail to see.There's been a horrendous murder in the city and Kim and her sharply-tuned team are called in. Who would set their sights on this dog walker? But the trail leads to someone with a stake in the game. And like over-reaching tentacles, more crimes are left on the doorstep. Evil is in the title and evil is in the veins of a heartless sociopath who relishes this interplay with no apparent consequences. We are given a front row seat into the mind of this crazed individual and the creep factor is blaring from the loud speakers in our heads. Goosebumps, a la carte.Marsons develops her storyline in such a way that blood and gore are not necessary. Your mind and your imagination are all you need to set the stage for the crimes and the atrocities that face Kim and her team. What Marsons leads with is pure intelligence and plausibility. She does her research and it is evident on each page. A smart, smart read.DI Kim Stone shows us that what may be determined as a weakness by others, can possibly be our greatest strength. I'm hanging my hat on the hook of this series and am looking forward to more from the brilliance of Angela Marsons.

Kim Stone against the equally talented but totally immoral Doctor Alexandra Thorne. In the course of the action we find out lots more about Kim's unfortunate childhood and her present day steely courage. She reminds me a bit of Eve Dallas.I enjoyed the many characters in this book and the entertaining conversation that often takes place between members of the team. Kim is an exceptionally good character with many flaws but also great strength. I also liked the police work that eventually solves all the cases and the dramatic action which keeps the story alive and very readable.I see that I have found myself yet another really good series and I will be reading book three as soon as possible:)"}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz", "userReview": "Enjoying myself as I make my way through the first few Kim Stone novels after reading books five and six. I love this DI. Being called to a murder scene and overhearing a constable calling her a cold bitch, her only concern is for the dog that witnessed the murder and making sure he's looked after. How could I not love her? In fact, all the scenes with Barney are heartwarming. Kim is working on two different cases and both are equally engaging. Dr. Alex Thorne is a true psychopath and is enthralled by Kim, whom she sees as a worthy rival. This book just grabbed me. I kept putting off everything I should have been doing - making dinner, going to sleep - in order to finish it. Book one was good, but this was much more engrossing. Highly recommend!

Both cases are well thought out and do not take away from the other case.One involves a revolting child abuser that\u2019s arrested in the beginning of the book. After Kim and her crew try to finish up the case, evidence comes to light that's things are not as they appear to be.The detectives must go into the world of sexual predators and figure out what\u2019s missing.Yep, it\u2019s not for the faint at heart but damn it, I loved when this case was solved!!!!The second case involves the murder of a convicted rapist and the circumstances involved with the suspect. This introduces us to a twisted individual that causes me to equally hate them and stay far, far away. Like a restraining order far away!!This case also introduces us to Barney and this ends up being one of the best things of the series so far!Seriously, if you have not had a chance to read this series, get to it.

Admittedly the first in the series was not my favourite book. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it - I read it before I started blogging my reviews so I actually can't remember what it was about it that didn't totally grab me. It seemed to grab the majority of my reading buddies who rated it extremely highly. I wasn't against reading the sequel, but it wasn't on my list of priorities. However when I kept seeing phenomenal reviews for this and the third instalment \"Lost Girls\", it sparked my interest again. When a few trusted book friends suggested that I give Kim Stone another shot, they convinced me. And I'm extremely glad they did!Detective Inspector Kim Stone is back in this fabulous psychological thriller. Stone investigates the murder of a convicted rapist. Something doesn't quite add up when they find the perpetrator, and trusting her instincts, Kim investigates deeper and gets more than she bargained for when she is faced with an extremely intelligent and difficult adversary, who is manipulating mentally vulnerable people to do their bidding.I am really enjoying the depth of Kim's character. Gradually we are learning more and more about why she is the way she is. Her childhood is explained in a lot of detail in this book and we begin to understand the horrors of her past. I'm extremely glad I read the second book before the third one, even though I have heard it is great as a stand alone. I also enjoy her interactions with other characters. I remember one of the things I didn't like about the first book was the lack of... I was going to say \"romance\" but that's not the word I am looking for, I guess tension or chemistry with Kim. There was a female teacher in the first one and someone else if I remember correctly, and in this one there was a glimmer of attraction with David, but I just felt it wasn't enough. I understand why though. Her character is MAJORLY damaged... Sorting out her life comes before a roll in the hay - I understand that, but still I am hoping that the third book will focus a bit on her attempting a not so platonic relationship with another human being. I always enjoy a bit of chemistry/tension in thrillers, even if it doesn't end well.I really enjoyed the psychological aspect of this book. What a character Alex was! Loved to loathe her! It was refreshing and original to read of events from her perspective... Her skewed view of the world. And I really enjoyed the mind games and the extent that she would go to, to get her way. I have read characters like hers before, in other books by other authors, but I didn't enjoy them half as much as I enjoyed Alex.There is some subject matter that is disturbing, but there are no overly graphic scenes. So this book will appeal to any thriller fans, even the ones who don't like too much violence and just enjoy a good story! As like the first one, Marsons writing is impeccable. Easy and so much fun to read. There are not too many characters, but there are just enough to make it difficult to guess who the bad guy is at the end. I was glued to this book from beginning to end and I am really looking forward to the next one! I have Lost Girls on my kindle ready to go! :)Would I recommend it?Absolutely!

Kim is caught up in two investigations, the tail end of a child abuse case and that of a man stabbed to death in the street. During the course of things she crosses swords with an adversary who has the power to get right inside her head and to draw out all those secrets Kim doesn\u2019t want anyone to know about. Whilst I liked Kim, I have to say that I absolutely adored psychiatrist Dr Alexandra Thorne, the adversary she has to pit her wits against. She is a cold, evil, calculating, remorseless sociopath who is intent on playing a very deadly game with her clients and when she meets Kim, she sees the chance to take her game one step further. I do enjoy characters like that, who are larger than life and who you can really start to hate with a passion. Kim herself is a very complex character who has built up walls around herself over the years and doesn\u2019t let anyone get too close, for reasons that will come out in the book. But, you just cannot help liking her.It is a really fast read, mainly because it is one that you just can\u2019t help finding excuses to read when you should be doing something else. There are several threads to the story which all come together at the end, although I wasn\u2019t too keen on the \u201clightbulb\u201d moment that tied up one of them.

The investigation is solved quickly as all evidence leads them to Ruth Willis, the women he brutally raped years ago. Ruth is arrested and is a sure conviction following her confession of the crime. Case closed. But DCI Kim Stone isn't certain that Ruth Willis is solely to blame. She has concerns that Ruth was manipulated by her psychiatrist, Alex Thorne. But Kim has no evidence and no one is taking her seriously. As the body count starts to mount the only thing the cases have in common is that they were all patients of Alexandra Thorne but the psychiatrist is a distinguished doctor in the community and Kim will have to dig deeper if she is to stop further killings. \n\"Okay, first question, what is a psychopath?\"\"It's a person without a conscience.\"\"These people are often charismatic, sexy, entertaining, and have a superficial charm that allows them to seduce people.\"\nNow Kim finds herself in the midst of the lethal psychopath's twisted experiments who will fight back using every weakness in Kim's past against her. Each move Kim makes could prove deadly.\n\"Her own fa\u00e7ade had been carefully and diligently constructed, course by course, over many years, but she'd never met anyone like Alexandra Thorne.\"\n\n\"Ultimately it came down to a single question. Was she prepared to enter this arena and risk her own fragile psyche to uncover the truth?\"\nAlongside Kim's search for the truth against Alex Thorne, another case is under investigation. DCI Stone and her team have worked for months putting together a case with enough evidence to put a man who has been abusing his two young daughters in the basement of his home. His wife insists she had no idea of the abuse happening right under her nose, literally. This seems unlikely as the girl's teacher had enough concerns to notify the police. Now, that case is in jeopardy and her team is having to review the case all over again. Evil Games by Angela Marsons is a devious game of cat and mouse. One is a monstrous psychopathic psychiatrist who prays on fragile psyches. Another is a determined DCI with a past that has left her with her own emotional damage. Which one is the cat and which one is the mouse? That is the question! The storyline is not only believable but is crafty, cunning, and original. It's an unsettling, fast paced thriller that's difficult to put down. I'm looking forward to reading the third DCI Kim Stone series as I really enjoyed the first two.

And, Kim Stone that sometimes annoyed me in the first book didn't annoy me at all this time, on the contrary, I came to like her. A rapist is killed by his victim, but this open and shut case feel wrong for Detective Kim Stone. Before the woman killed her rapist did she have a session with her psychologist. could it be that the psychologist planted the thought about the killing? And, if so, why would she do that? Kim Stone and her team must also put a child molester behind bars, but it seems that the man in question wasn't alone...It was easy to get into this book and I think that you don't need to read the first book to be able to enjoy and keep up with what's going on. What I liked about this book was that I found the story interesting from the beginning not like with Silent Scream where it took me around half the book to get into the story. There are some very tragic and intense moments in this book. Kim Stone is still a very special character, she doesn't let people into her life, but there are moments in this book when she lets down her guard a bit.I didn't expect the ending in the child molesting case, I felt totally left in the dark until it was revealed.

She was so despicable!Kim is a wonderfully complex character. I really want to know more about her, and this book offered additional info to what we learned in Silent Scream, the first Kim Stone book. There's still more to come, I hope. Bryant is so very understanding of her, and his wife must be a saint!Ms. Marsons mentions some other cases in this book. One I know to be true is that of Susan Smith who drove her car into a lake with her two small children secured inside. I remember seeing her plea for help on TV and I immediately knew she was lying and faking it. I'll never forget that feeling of disgust.So, I am prepared to read everything Angela Marsons writes.

There are a total of three and the next one is called Lost Girls.The suspense was everywhere in the book. I do not like gooks whereby he suspense is just at the ending.

Kim Stone series reflects my antipathy to utilising my Kindle, and is in no way a response to my reaction to Silent Scream, which impressed me immensely. In introducing D.I. Kim Stone and her team, Angela Marsons proved herself an assured new voice in the world of crime fiction, adept in juggling suspense, drawing a distinctive cast of characters and managing an involving plot. Silent Scream introduced the dogmatic, motorbike riding and self-acknowledged socially inept loner, D.I. Kim Stone and what a huge impression she made on the crime fiction landscape and the Black Country! Driven and capable of clinical detachment, her distance from others is the result of an unenviable childhood, specifically the loss of a twin brother at a young age and then being passed between numerous sets of fosters parents. Exceptionally skilled in her job as D.I. she has a gift for reading people and her emotional detachment is essential for such clear-sighted logic. It owes much to Marsons skilful portrayal that Kim doesn't feel like just another of the damaged, dysfunctional detective brigade, but a fully developed, all singing and dancing character.Evil Games launches straight into the action and opens with a dawn raid on the home of a father suspected of sexually abusing his daughters. It has taken months of painstaking work to get to this stage and build a watertight case, and no one is more emotionally invested in the outcome than the woman at the helm. The gut-wrenching sickness that accompanies the discovery of a padlocked cellar/playroom where eight-year-old Daisy Dunn and her sister Louisa were exposed to depravities that will never be forgotten is their lifetime is a real incentive for all the team to nail the case. As the team is cuffing the abusive forty stone abusive father, Leonard Dunn, mother Wendy steadfastly denies all knowledge of her husbands predilections. The subsequent failure by the CPS to prove her involvement sticks in the craw of Kim, especially when she knows that there was a second adult present at events. When obsessive visits to the location and video evidence corroborates Kim's belief that someone else was present she must tread gently amongst the memories of the abused girls to extricate an identification and secure a conviction.Alongside this the team are handling the serious crimes in the rest of the Black Country and pretty soon the discovery that a convicted rapist, since released, has been found murdered just two-hundred yards from his home is the big news. Swiftly apprehending the perpetrator and the man's original victim, twenty-four year old Ruth Willis, seems a 'gimme', but nothing is ever that simple in crime fiction! Hiding behind a wall full of diplomas and qualifications is a ruthlessly unscrupulous psychiatrist pulling the strings and treating Ruth. DS Bryant is fooled by the glamorous and overly earnest Dr Alexandra Thorne who in Ruth spots a candidate ripe for experimentation and a vulnerable victim susceptible to subtle manipulation. For there is no doubt that Dr Thorne's unethical interventions are intentional as she selects those most vulnerable and mercilessly dangles the lure of revenge before their eyes. As Dr Thorne explains her methodology and what is in theory a retraining of the pattern of responses to destructive thoughts, D.I. Stone is not for one minute fooled by her outward demeanour and soon Ruth is not her only client to turn killer...The focus on the novel is weighted heavily towards Kim's instinctive feelings about Dr Thorne and the focus on the Dunn abuse case takes second place but I would have appreciated a more even spread. Some insight into the painstaking teamwork undertaken to obtain the warrant to enter the home of the Dunn's and the build up to the dawn raid would have added to the story, however it feels more like more like a filler and an opportunity to raise issues sensitive to Kim and her own life in the care system. The focus of Evil Games is an opportunity to become acquainted with the true nature of a sociopath and Marsons proves herself a thorough and perceptive voice who is adept at making this accessible to her readers, through empirical evidence and actual events, to real life occurrences. However, at times this becomes a little heavy-going and more a battle of wits between Kim and Dr Alexandra than diligent teamwork and constructing a convincing case. Although the procedural details involved in Evil Games are minimal, I was again impressed by the depth of Marsons knowledge in real world policing, reinforcing the belief that she is readily versatile with the specifics and not simply content with resting on her laurels. Angela Marsons has a gift for writing dialogue, in particular she voices her two leading characters of D.I. Kim Stone and DS Bryant excellently. Being friends whilst maintaining their standings in the team, they talk off the record, expressing opinions freely and also display the camaraderie that makes a partnership tick. Despite Kim having risen through the ranks significantly faster than Bryant and having twelve-years on her, there is no animosity. Likewise, the pairing of DC Stacey Wood and DS Kev Dawson is getting into its stride and starting to pay dividends.I found that in the second half of Evil Games the pace abated somewhat, but I suspect this was by virtue of the two cases under scrutiny, with one essentially being a reworking of a previous case and the other an off the record qualm concerning the ethical adherence of a psychiatrist. Some general background on how a psychiatrist would have been investigated in such a situation would also have been welcomed as surely this is the role for the body whose qualification she holds and not something that the police would want to get too involved in. It is hard to find fault with the pulse-pounding exhilarating fifty-page finale and the prospect of seeing the ensuing collateral damage sustained by D.I. Kim Stone in follow-up novel, The Lost Girls, is certainly a draw. There is no doubt indeed that this case has left an indelible imprint on D.I Kim Stone's psyche and I shall be interested to see how she evolves in book three. An enjoyable novel, but the subject matter didn't generate the suspense and thrilling pace of Silent Scream. I hope to see more of Kim and her team at the forefront of serious crime and building cases and less of Kim's mysterious sixth-sense dictating the events under scrutiny."}, {"userName": "sue", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377874-sue", "userReview": "After reading Angela Marsons first book Silent Screams and being blown away by it, I have been watching this author from afar until her next book.

This is just as good.

Even putting herself out there......Even knowing this could emotionally wreck herWe have many instances in this book, related crimes that you see being tied up with one woman. One manipulating woman. This woman has the power to crush the DI Kim Stone, but does she?Kim has never faced her past. I see one step taken in this book and that's when she gets a dog. I see the tenderness that Kim has deep down and buried for people. I've had the chance of looking into a sociopath and all that stands for. This book is so finely tuned, its so well researched. We have the girl who was raped.We have the same girl who murdered her rapist.We have the Mother of the rapist.We have the Mother of the reformed rapist.We have a girl who thinks that this world is so bad she should kill her baby for safety.We have other events too.

I found her frightening yet truly fascinating.This book covers very dark and emotive topics, so not for the faint hearted.
