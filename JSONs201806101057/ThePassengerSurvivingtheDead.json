I've been a fan of James Cook for a while, but I hesitated reading this one. I'm not even sure why... I think maybe because I didn't think I'd be into the first-person perspective of a zombie. No offense to zombies, but I thought it would be all about ripping people apart and the eating of flesh. There was some of that, but not nearly as much as I thought there would be. I never knew a zombie could become a likable character in any book, but I found myself cheering this one on. The book isn't solely written from the perspective of one of the undead, however. There is also the third-person account of a character Cook introduced in one of his earlier books. I've never read any books by Joshua Guess, but I will definitely start reading his in the near future."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "Gabe & Eric have bonded hard and fast over beers, martial art fights and grief. The start of this book really drew me in but then swung me back to sometime before the apocalypse. I was slowly informed how they got set up so well, plausibly believable.JNC does a spectacular job of starting the zompoc with a unique way of describing the ground rules regarding infection and how to kill a zombie.Both men are 3D and I worried about them from the start. As I was led to follow Eric on his cross country trek to get to Gabe I lived all the detailed descriptions of the houses and places he visits.There is a lot of gun chatter and strapping on of weapons, which for non ammo-nerd this gets a little tedious.When he stumbles upon a group sheltering in a warehouse it\u2019s nice to see JNC does not go down the \u201conly the bad survive\u201d route. A plot is soon hatched amongst them to raid the nearest town as Eric brings valuable information about the undead.The planning does get a bit repetitive after a while and I wanted to skip on past to get to the action. However, I really enjoyed all the people interaction and I did enjoy the way JNC incorporated the back story of everyone in the group in a different way for each.One niggle in the continuity is in the first chapter where it states that Eric is not a good shot due to being rusty, but then as the story travels backwards you are shown how much practice he gets and how often he is told how good he is!As JNC brought me full circle I have to say I really enjoyed the hope given and not just the misery.I am supposed to be going to Atlanta for the next WHC (2015) after reading this I am not so keen."}, {"userName": "lynda  dwight", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30849201-lynda-dwight", "userReview": "a very fast paced zombie read. a different take on what it must feel like to have been turned into a zombie and have your mind still work somewhat but not be able to control your body . the passenger against odds finds a way to use rage to control his body's movement to do the one thing humane left in a world overcome with zombies. a man sick and succumbed himself to meth decides if he is dying then everyone in the world should die along with him and finds a way to use a horde of zombies to do just that. he searches for survivors and lures the horde to kill and make more and yet stays remarkedly safe enough away as to not become a victim himself... until he gets to one last survivor camp where he is outsmarted . and the passenger uses his rage to make his body move like a human just long enough to take out this murderer who doesn't understand the meaning of life and what it stands for... after wards the passenger remembers or understands the true meaning and finally gets what he has been waiting for the entire time after he was bitten and turned into this murderous monster... the passenger is finally able to leave his ride and become free...I enjoyed the nonstop action the thought process of a zombie where you would hope part of you still remained.

The scope expanded from survivors vs infected to survivors, meth-crazed outlaw, and the titles namesake \"the passenger\". The passenger turns out to be the vocalized thoughts of one of the infected who regains some of his intellect and abilities. This is pretty obvious from the beginning so I'm not giving up too much information. Quite an interesting twist and quite a detour from the previous plot line. It works though and I got used to the new direction once it became clear where we were going. I liked it.First read 11/29/2013; re-read before proceeding with \"Fire in Winter: Surviving the Dead\"."}, {"userName": "Shannon Campos-hatfield", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19705328-shannon-campos-hatfield", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the passenger. It is a zombie story from three characters. An army group, a big jerk (Gideon) and a zombie itself. The chapters flip from one to the other...not bad at all. This book was written by (what i understand) two authors. They work seamlessly! The story has great flow (not boring), great characters and a great ending.

This is NOT book four, and should be read before starting book one, Victim Zero (according to the authors, and I concur). Seriously unlike any zombie book I've read !!!! It's one story being told from two directions, one of which is from the zombie himself!!!! Loads of ACTION as well as lots of emotion to be felt by the reader, at least in my case anyway.

Character crossovers from earlier novels! Solid read. Brings in enough information to make it relevant to the main series. The crossover characters from the series provide a richer picture of the people they were and what made them whom they are. The passenger angle was very intriguing.

There are actually two stories in one within this book; one follows Ethan and his squad of soldiers from Ft. Bragg as they patrol the wasteland - seeking out and eliminating zombies, the other is told through the eyes of a male zombie, dead and roaming for two years, after his brain suddenly regains consciousness within a deteriorating walking corpse.Survivors of the Apocalypse have established forts across the frontier, growing their own food and taking advantage of the sun for power. Zombies are few and far in between and seldom pose a threat throughout the area. Each camp had established a leadership, developed and trained a militia and built defensive perimeters to protect the inhabitants from attacks by the undead. They are trying to make a life for themselves, trade routes were opened between the camps and designated, well-stocked rest areas established to accommodate those who are taking the risk to travel between these locations. A sheriff and deputies also travel on horseback through this wasteland to ensure the safety of these camps and their inhabitants.It isn't long before the patrol of soldiers is ambushed by armed marauders on horseback. The soldiers have known about these groups, who were attacking these small settlements, killing or enslaving the inhabitants and then taking all the supplies for themselves. Eventually, the sheriff and deputies are captured after one of these firefights by the military soldiers who suspect them to be marauders - they're soon cleared when Ft. Bragg vouches for them. There is a major concern when a string of three settlements along the group of outposts goes \"dark\" and can't be reached. The two groups join forces and head out to investigate.Meanwhile, a horde of zombies, comprised of thousands of decomposing bodies - one of which has a brain that came back to life, roam through the wasteland seeking food. Mr. live brain learns that he is unable to control or impact any of the \"auto-pilot\" signals directing his body; he's a prisoner or \"passenger\" along for the ride. The horde has travelled long distances and growing in size - becoming an unstoppable force. They are moving with a purpose and periodically get rewarded with fresh bodies to feast upon. Are they organized with a leader at the helm? What's driving them across the frontier? Eventually, Mr. live brain and the infantry sergeant meet and experience a rare moment of communication!This is a difficult book to put down and will keep readers on the edge. Highly recommended! I've also read Mr. Cooks \"Surviving the Dead\" series and enjoyed them immensely! Great work all the way around!

Cook and Joshua GuessPublisher: Amazon.comDate: 2013Pgs: 205REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSSummary:One bite and the infection spreads. A man gets bitten...to spare his family from having to watch him be consumed by the disease and rise again, he runs away. Soon after, he is dead. Only, he wakes up inside the zombie that his body has become. Not as a controlling force, but as a passenger. A passenger carried along as the monster he has become eats the unwary and destroys civilization, one victim at a time. In this world, there is the living...the dead...and between them, is the Passenger.Genre:ApocalypseEnd of the WorldFictionHorrorZombiesWhy this book:The concept of a poor bastard trapped inside his zombified body, aware of all that it does, while being swept along. Woof!______________________________________________________________________________Favorite Character:The Passenger is a good concept and an alright character. His efforts to take back some control of his environment are a good meaty bit of the story.Staff Sergeant Ethan Thompson is a good character, if a bit cardboard.Least Favorite Character: Gideon is a great villain.The Feel:There is a lot of horror in the idea behind the Passenger. The zombies being mindless eating machines is one thing. The idea that the people they once were are inside those monsters being able to see and feel what is happening and not being able to do anything about it.Favorite Scene:The massacre of Broken Bridge and the aftermath that the Sheriff and Sgt Thompson discover when they arrive..Pacing:The flow is good on this story.Hmm Moments:May have lost me with the \u201cnow it\u2019s personal\u201d moment that the Passenger has. Up until that moment, the concept was neat to me. The story recovered well from what I was afraid was a \u201cc\u2019mon man\u201d moment.Why isn\u2019t there a screenplay?I\u2019m not sure that you could communicate the concept of the Passenger well...just look at the movie Warm Bodies which I didn\u2019t enjoy.______________________________________________________________________________Last Page Sound:Well...alright.Author Assessment:Would read the blurb and decide.Editorial Assessment:Someone should have asked about the \u201cnow it\u2019s personal\u201d moment, but other than that this was a well written book.Knee Jerk Reaction:glad I read itDisposition of Book:e-BookWould recommend to:genre fans"}, {"userName": "Monique", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37076262-monique", "userReview": "To be fair, this book is number 3.5 in a series of 5 novels and it's the first one I've read.

The book does an interesting job providing a glimpse into different characters minds.There were moments when my mind wandered. This could be because I didn't have have the background knowledge that would have come from reading the preceeding books.I enjoyed the ending.
