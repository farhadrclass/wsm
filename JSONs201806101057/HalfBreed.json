Campbell's memoir is simply brutal - a series of cascading heartbreaks one after another.

It can be hard to read because Maria Campbell really faced one difficulty after another after another... I am in awe of the grit and determination she shows in not giving in to despair and in telling her story so honestly. Definitely a book to pass on to everyone you know \u2013 an education in Canadian racism against aboriginal peoples.

Anyone who can read this book and not feel incredibly lucky themselves is either heartless and soulless or living a truly terrible life. In Half-Breed Maria Campbell, a Halfbreed who grew up in Saskatchewan, describes her childhood and early adulthood, living in poverty, dealing with racism and discrimination, trying to avoid the division of her family at the hands of the government, suffering abuse, turning to prostitution and drugs, and finally getting clean and finding hope in Native politics. Her personal life story is extraordinary and heartbreaking, but the text goes beyond just telling her own story. She makes sure to position her memoir in the broader context of Halfbreed history. She opens by describing the way that her people have had to move from place to place as white people and their government settled on their lands, how they eventually tried to work within the Canadian system in order to preserve the land they did have but failed because they could not earn enough money to pay for upkeep, how a major political movement grew up and then died away in the face of divisions among the people. Campbell's life and the sense of hopelessness and failure most of her family, friends, and neighbors exist within is a direct result of this history. Campbell concludes Half-Breed by looking to the future. The political movement she had been involved in becomes another failure, but she continues to believe that one day, and one day soon, things will change. She writes,\"For these past couple of years, I've stopped being the idealistically shiny-eyed young woman I once was. I realize that an armed revolution of Native people will never come about; even if such a thing were possible what would we achieve? We would only end up oppressing someone else. I believe that one day, very soon, people will set aside their differences and come together as one. Maybe not because we love one another, but because we will need each other to survive. Then together we will fight our common enemies. Change will come because this time we won't give up. There is growing evidence of that today.\" (184)I wonder if she now, thirty-six years later, thinks that this has happened already or, is she, like her grandmother did for more than one hundred years, still looking hopefully toward the future."}, {"userName": "Sydney", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10747138-sydney", "userReview": "\"Halfbreed\" is brief in its pages, but heavy in its heart. It's an autobiography I can and will champion for its revelation of Canada's systemic racism against Indigenous peoples, both in the past and in the present. Maria Campbell was born to a M\u00e9tis family on the Canadian prairies and grew up believing she was a worthless \"halfbreed,\" and one of those \"road allowance\" people squatting on crown land. As her family faced extreme poverty and hardship, they also struggled to be accepted by both non-Indigenous communities and status Indigenous communities. Maria's family fought with their community to be recognized as its own culture and people, but they were consistently betrayed and degraded in the Canadian and provincial political systems. Maria's hard childhood turned into a harder transition to adulthood, marked by alcoholism and drug-use and the meeting of other wayward characters searching for stability, home, and family. Maria has since found her calling in M\u00e9tis politics, fighting to establish a functional and less misunderstood relationship between the government and the \"road allowance\" peoples; I believe equally great work has been accomplished in the writing of this autobiography, bringing to light the realities of growing up as a \"halfbreed\" in Canada. Maria Campbell's \"Halfbreed\" often earns the credit as the first published book from the Canadian Indigenous perspective. But it is, as it ever was, still relevant today. While great political advances have been made since 1973, the M\u00e9tis identity still struggles socially to be recognized as a unique culture of its own by Canadians. And the general disrespect and racism of Canadians towards First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit peoples is absolutely still a great issue. I believe, however, the extremely heavy burden of Native stereotypes may have a chance of being eliminated if every Canadian could pick up a book like \"Halfbreed.\" They say you can't judge a person until you walk a day in their shoes, imagine what could be accomplished if we got to read their entire life in only 167 pages."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46776912-kat", "userReview": "I loved the descriptions of her childhood. She was a very resourceful girl. I would have loved to learn some of the skills she had as a young girl. I feel bad for her in a way. Not so much for her life but for her feelings about it. There is a lot of anger and most of it directed at 'white people'. She blames them for her problems and for the problems of native men. A lot of people have been treated wrongly throughout history but it is how you handle yourself that will be remembered. When a person drinks to excess, does drugs, beats or neglects their family, there are consequences. You can't spend your life blaming others. There will always be ignorant people who will treat others poorly and look down on them for whatever reasons. That is their problem. Don't let them win by becoming exactly what they say about you. I can think of so many people who have suffered through no fault of their own. Slavery. Genocide. Horrors like people having their hands cut off or being burned with acid. Maria was embarrassed by her culture and lived a life at times that resembled the stereotypes of indigenous peoples. Her hardships were poverty, embarrassment, and name calling. I had a hard time reading these things because I saw similarities in myself and my own response to problems in my life. It gave me a lot to think about."}, {"userName": "Lester", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5290247-lester", "userReview": "This book does the 'speaks volumes'. A book to be read in school as 'The Outsiders' and 'To Kill A Mockingbird' are.

In the 30 plus years that I have lived here..there is such a struggle to do right that each small accomplishment only happens with much hardship and sorrow..STILL. The good things are getting better and the changes are positive.A quote from Half Breed;\"My Cheechum used to tell me that when the government gives you something, they take all that you have in return--your pride, your dignity, all the things that make you a living soul. When they are sure they have everything, they give you a blanket to cover your shame.

Somehow I missed reading it, in spite of my own parents having a copy. I think part of it was that my parents felt I was too young to be reading about Campbell's later involvement in drugs and prostitution. I am intrigued by the natives' evolved self-classification into racial substrata - it mirrors the experiences of the slaves who came to North America and wound up mixing with whites. There are more levels than I can comprehend. This type of sorting happens all over the world among every race and I find it really foreign to my modern frame of reference. Why does it matter who your parents are, I ask myself?"}, {"userName": "Karan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62796633-karan", "userReview": "I was very engaged with this book, the story-telling approach, amazed at how much Maria lived and loved and survived in so few years.

I am so glad I had to read this though, it was incredibly powerful and raw, without any dull moments. It really is amazing that this is a true story!This biography does an amazing job disrupting the stereotype of Canada being a fantasy land of a united, free, happy, generous people. What I really love about it though, is the way Campbell doesn't look back on her life and critically reflect on it, but instead she just narrates it and lets the story speak for itself. It's reads as an action packed, raw journey of determination and perseverance. It really made me conscious of how powerful racial and circumstantial privilege really is in Canada; yet how ridiculous it is that this sort of privilege even exists.Campbell's personal growth, especially in relation to Cheechum's philosophy on life, was really slow burning yet amazing to watch. There was the perfect balance of plot action (unfortunately for Campbell) and character development, making for an amazing read and a powerful story.I also really appreciated how the first chapter of the book situated the story within a specific historical context. It really helped clarify the where the story is coming from, and would especially be beneficial to people who are not familiar with Canadian history. Though this chapter is a bit of a dry history lesson, it really is necessary and sets up the book well.The only small problem I had with the book was the host of people introduced at the beginning. I got flustered with all the names of great great grandparents, great grandparents, grandparents, parents, and other family. I especially had a hard time remembering the race or nationality of specific family members. But in the grand scheme of the novel it really didn't affect my reading of the story too much since the story is told in chronological order and doesn't make reference to specific past family members too much. I just wish there was a family tree at the beginning of the book! It might even be worth it to create your own while reading this for the first time.Overall I think this is a powerful story about colonization, racism, struggle, and Canadian culture. Even if you're not Canadian, I would highly recommend this book! Just be aware that because this is a book about struggle and perseverance, there are trigger warnings for domestic violence, drug use, alcohol use, and prostitution."}, {"userName": "Farwa Khtana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60037554-farwa-khtana", "userReview": "Campbell provides a unique insight into the struggles of indigenous women in Canada. Her writing style is creative and entertaining, and I have to say, the book was very touching at some parts.However, I feel that it lacked in some respects. It's true that this is an autobiography, and the details of the book can't be changed (since they were actual events in her life), but I feel she could've been more specific for some parts. For example, we never really find out what her jobs were in Vancouver. We also never find out how she suddenly started using drugs. It just came all of a sudden. I understand that it may be hard for her to write about those events, but I think it's helpful for the reader to have a fuller picture as to what's going on.I had to read this book for class, and would probably not have picked it up otherwise.

Halfbreed is Campbell's memoir; an account of the struggles she had to overcome, such as racism, addiction, and misogyny, and her quest to find a way out.Seeing as how I read Joy Kogawa's Obasan earlier this year, I feel it's hard not to draw comparisons between the two novels. While Obasan is a more poetic -- and in my opinion, better -- novel, both tell stories of overwhelming hardship and strengthh.
