A parte la diversit\u00e0 di scrittura, sorvolando sul rispettivo talento, gli \u2018eroi\u2019 di Carver sono ordinary people, gente comune, persone della vita di tutti i giorni, alle quali il lettore pu\u00f2 facilmente sovrapporsi. I protagonisti di Franklin sarebbero persone comuni in un girone dell\u2019inferno: allibratori, bracconieri, contrabbandieri, ladri, assassini, mangiano opossum e scoiattoli, scuoiano cervi, si ubriacano un giorno s\u00ec e l\u2019altro pure, infilano il braccio nella bocca dei pesce gatto, maneggiano armi sin da bambini, si lavano col fango quando sono puliti, conoscono meglio il calibro di pistole e fucili che la sintassi\u2026Il talento di Franklin \u00e8 di rendere questi individui ordinari come se abitassero nell\u2019appartamento accanto. Vicini di casa che non si vorrebbe mai avere, ordinari come lo sono i personaggi dei film di Quentin Tarantino.James Franco sembra avere una passione ossessiva per Tom Franklin: ha annunciato che vuole produrre tre film tratti da sue opere, \u201cPoachers-Alabama Blues\u201d per l\u2019appunto, \u201cSmonk\u201d e Hell at the Breech\u201d, entrambe non tradotte in Italia. Qui un\u2019immagine da \u201cGoat\u201d del 2016, un film da lui interpretato che racconta con discreta brutalit\u00e0 il mondo delle fraternity.Brutalit\u00e0, violenza, conflitto, un mondo selvaggio e crudele di cacciatori, pescatori, giocatori, perdenti, bevitori, bracconieri, un mondo che la maggior parte di noi non ha mai visto. E probabilmente, mai vedr\u00e0.Franklin ha un\u2019attrazione per i soggetti maudit e deviati che lo approssima al gotico molto pi\u00f9 che a Carver o alla grande letteratura del Sud degli Stati Uniti.Siamo in pieno country, screziato di cajun, whiskey di segale, cibi agrodolci e piccanti, solitudine, malinconia, sconfitta, fuoristrada su quattroruote e su due gambe, attenzione cinematografica per il dettaglio.

As you might expect, their lives are far from cheerful. Alcohol and firearms offer escape, and bad things end up happening to plenty of animals and people. Probably the only negative thing I can say about these stories is that some of them are...forgettable.Not so the title story about a nasty trio of backwoods brothers being stalked by a mythical game warden. His job was to protect the wild things the law had deemed worthy. Deer and turkeys. Alligators. But how did the Gates boys fall into the category of trash animal--wildcats or possums or armadillos, snapping turtles, snakes? Things you could kill any time, run over in your truck and not even look at in your mirror to see dying behind you? Christ. Why couldn't Frank David see that he, more than a match for the boys, was exactly the same as them?Okay.

Ever since reading Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter I have wanted more. This is Franklin's debut of short stories. I don\u2019t think I can describe this selection better than the book blurb for the atmosphere it imparts. The title lettering on my cover copy reminds me of a movie poster for a horror film. The theme of poaching runs throughout but applies a broader interpretation to the author\u2019s home state of lower Alabama in the 1980/90s era as it \u201cyields its forests, bogs, and rivers to lumber mills, power plants, and chemical factories.\u201d It\u2019s dark and scary, populated with cruel, violent men living off the land, alcohol, beef jerky, beer, M&Ms, and cigarettes. Alabama\u2019s state motto translates as We Defend Our Rights and many of these characters have extreme personal viewpoints of what those are and how to protect them without boundaries or limits, no doubt jacked up on their dietary choices. I found it necessary to skip one chapter that dealt with particular animal cruelty but cannot explain why I made it through the others. I was thinking I could have done without this one until I read the last story from which the book gets the title. I\u2019m going to read it again before I return this book to the library.I\u2019ve been complaining about popular thrillers I\u2019ve read lately. Mainly because they don\u2019t deliver for me. Mr. Franklin could teach a writing class on Thrillers 101. This was the real deal and will no doubt haunt me for a while. Overall I was thinking maybe three stars until that last one. Unforgettable.

They aren't likable--among other things, they request as part of their payment that a man bring his fifteen year-old daughter out on the porch so they can stare at her--but there is a grubby, wild vulnerability to them. They're brutal, but they'll never belong. They're something the town permits to exist--something the area's game wardens ignore--because their lives have been so strange that this seems like the only way they can live. But that's the kind of silent permission that can only exist when everyone knows the rules, so when a new game warden arrives and tries to fulfill his job by arresting the boys for poaching and the Gates boys respond by killing him, well, it seems like the pact has been broken.But one of the things that makes \"Poachers\" so brilliant is the strangeness of what follows, where the concept of civilization loosens until it seems to lose its meaning. Kirxy's determination to see the boys face no consequences for the murder runs up not so much against the local law but against a personal vendetta as savage and as little tethered to the rules of society as the boys themselves. And what results is violent and grotesque and darkly moving.The other stories are fine. \"Grit,\" which opens the book, is a bleak comedy, sort of \"Bartleby the Scrivener\" reversed, about a manager of a grit plant who finds his job slowly taken over by one of his less law-abiding employees, has a terrific sense of place even if the level of reality at which the story is working is never entirely clear. \"The Ballad of Duane Juarez,\" which sees a man in a going-nowhere life of seething envy eventually shooting a car trunk's worth of kittens, feels like a Drive By Truckers song in prose: a story that gets into the anger and hopelessness behind an appalling act and then tells it straight. (I had to slot that one into the review because I feel \"brutal kitten slaughter\" might be a dealbreaker for some. I liked the story but found that difficult to get through.) \"Tiny History\" has the great vibe of being a Raymond Carver story transplanted into Franklin-land, a two-couple get-together full of regret and viciousness and the desire to swap partners. Those are the ones I found especially engaging, but all the stories have Franklin's style, which is exceptional--poetic and bloody, and never shying away--and an evocation of setting and Southern atmosphere that's simultaneously gorgeous and entrenched in mundane details. It's just that a few too many of them feel like exercises in mood that are still in search of plots.Nevertheless: \"Poachers.\" And it's worth saying that Franklin's introduction is superb, a description of his childhood where the rites of passage involved hunting and having his face smeared with deer's blood, and how he comes back to that as an adult, with love for that history and setting, appreciation for the power of its strangeness and wildness, and disdain for outsiders who turn away from the truth of that allure and would fence everything in and make it safe and exclusive. It shouldn't be skipped--the strength of its narrative and the sharpness of its details make it an indelible story as well as a persuasive essay."}, {"userName": "Larry Bassett", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett", "userReview": "I am not a hunter. I am not an outdoor person. I am not the rough and ready type at all. I do not play contact sports \u2013 or, for that matter, much any sport. Not even poker or darts. I walk the dog. I read. I take care of all of my ADLs as necessary. I do live in the south in the Bible Belt and try to acknowledge that by paying some attention to southern literature. I joined the GR group On the Southern Literary Trail some time ago and have discovered quite a few new authors as a result. I have just recently come to understand that there is a genre sometimes called Grit Lit. I guess grit can refer to the food made from corn or to the abrasive made from fine sand. So I am surprised when our author Tom Franklin writes: What am I doing here at the Blowout, during hunting season, without a gun? It\u2019s a familiar sensation, this snag of guilt, because when I was growing up, a boy who didn\u2019t hunt was branded as a pussy. For some reason, I never wanted to kill things, but I wasn\u2019t bold enough to say so. Instead, I did the expected: went to church on Sundays and on Wednesday nights, said \u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cNo sir\u201d to my elders. And I hunted.As I am reading the story, I find that I want to learn about abrasives so I go to http://www.uama.org/Abrasives101/101T.... I am reading about deer hunting, reading about the manufacture of grit, reading about how to operate a front end loader. This book reminds me of some of the things I did as a kid in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak when I was growing up in the 1950s that were neither safe nor savory. So there is some identification going on in my mind. He\u2019ll be waiting on my steps early one morning as I\u2019m getting home from work. He\u2019ll crack jokes about punching a time clock. He\u2019ll tell me he sold the Triumph in Tempe, Arizona, and moved in with a Navajo woman for too many months, then stole her Trans Am and drove to California to live with his friend Laura, an actress. That he got a bit part in a Robert De Niro gangster film and somebody recognized him and the FBI found him and he did time. That when he was released after two years, he rode the bus east across the country. He watched the states pass him by, buttes and deserts and oil wells and famous rivers and markers of historic events. Outside El Paso they passed a huddle of Mexicans standing in their yard watching their house burn down. In another bus he crossed Louisiana during the dark early morning hours with a plastic flask in his pocket, watching his cigarette tip glow in the window, reading the names of places and trying to remember if he knew anybody from there. Do I really want to know or get to know anyone like that? Maybe not.  We\u2019ll notice things: three hawks in the same dead tree. A flatbed truck hauling a steeple. A child\u2019s wheelchair in front of a trailer. We\u2019ll drink beer and stop to piss along the road between the towns, Creola, Axix, Bucks, Sunflower, Mount Vernon, Calvert, McIntosh, Wagerville, Leroy, Jackson, Grove Hill, Fulton. Would they want to share a Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale? Probably not. Maybe the book cover says it succinctly in the most positive light: This terrain isn't pretty, isn't for the weak of heart, but in these desperate, lost people, Franklin somehow finds the moments of grace that make them what they so abundantly are: human. I\u2019d say there is some truth there. But nastiness that overwhelms the humanity, I think, too often.Dinosaurs: This has got to be the best story in the book. Steadman trades the cover up of a leaky gas storage tank at Kilpatrick\u2019s Sinclair station for a 350 pound stuffed rhinoceros for his Dad\u2019s seventy-eighth birthday. This story reeks with the smell of oil and half-smoked cigarettes and filial love.Sometimes good writing can overcome nasty stories. Tom Franklin can do that to me in Poachers where he got started in the grit trade in 1999. The boy\u2019s got some miles on him now and has broke in some stories. I\u2019m glad I met him with  Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter  first. I\u2019d say he made it through some rough territory to get to that book. I saw him first at his best. In these short stories he still had a ways to go to find his best. Poachers is a strong three stars. It kept me reading through the title story but glad to call it a day and move on to the other books we are reading this month. I also just ordered a copy of The Tilted World, Franklin\u2019s most recent book that he co-wrote with his wife. I am hoping she smoothed out some of the unnecessary (for me) roughness."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25936805-sandra", "userReview": "JESUS IS NOT COMING.\n\nNope.Better to rely on guns and alcohol these people must've thought.

I had put it on the \"I'll get to it some day\" shelf. It was selected as a group read this month within the group On the Southern Literary Trail, so I decided no time like the present. What a good decision.Franklin get's right to it. To my taste, there's not a bad one in there.......but they're all bad from the perspective that he can dive beyond surface level and get to the marrow of the undersides of people, places, and things. The parts normally not on display for purpose of public consumption. I have to think a bit of Franklin's perplexed mind is also on display- the parts that can blend factory work with spare time spent reading novels, badge carrying poachers with their young boys who question the desire to hunt or kill at all, chicken fighting with beloved patriarchal lawmen and salt of the earth levelheadedness. There's no filtering the truth as he sees it.My favorites without question were \"Dinosaurs\" and the longer than the rest \"Poachers\". I found it quite fitting that in the acknowledgments Franklin thanked Rick Bass, as \"Dinosaurs\" could have just as easily been penned by Bass. I had no idea of the connection between the two of them. While their writing has taken a different trajectory since the time this was published, I certainly can see the connective tissue on the front side of Franklin's published works.One last note, the author photo on the back cover of my copy cracks me up! Having met Franklin last year at the Southern Festival of Books, the bio pic clashes in a hilarious way with the author of 2013. That day he was dressed in a wild, loud, paisley pattern, starched crisp button up oxford and wore en vogue spectacles straight from the cover of GQ (not in a \"impress you\" way, more a statement of individuality). That mind picture, and the snapshot on the back of this one don't even know each other..........or perhaps they do.........like I said, he can blend together opposites in a way that you get the opportunity to meet both halves."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "I have to say, for a first book, these short stories were superbly written.

The testosterone practically spurts off the pages in this country noir short story collection. I'm sure I could go on about it being a fascinating study of masculinity and all that, but all you need to know is there's lots of violence, hatred and general backwoodsy wickedness.

Some are resigned to simply endure, all in the service of maintaining the only existence they\u2019re capable of imagining. While for others, the dream \u2013 no matter how improbable \u2013 is to just pack up the car and get going, get out, and get anywhere on nothing but collective wit and fumes, perhaps get as far away as Alaska and the rumored wealth awaiting them there.But in this place with its entrenched poverty among a folk this degraded, when things can go bad, when dreams can go bust, they usually do. Spectacularly so. These stories from Tom Franklin are reliably violent, and suitably ill-fated, peopled with characters who, if they weren\u2019t self-destructive it might be difficult to identify any other character trait they do possess. And yet this collection of faithless womenfolk, frugal hill-dwellers, skin and bones black poor, and colorfully named hunting dogs is somehow unsympathetic, the victims of being, perhaps, too carefully drawn.Make no mistake, Tom Franklin can conjure up the bedraggled South \u2013 or at least how I imagine it must be \u2013 but too often the scenes that result have the feel of something created for the stage rather than the page. A hound dog by the fieldstone fireplace. The sound of raccoons scrounging in the garbage cans outside. Coyotes down at the pond hunting bullfrogs. The bullfrogs croaking in the mist. The toothless granny singing gospel hymns, her rocking chair thumping against the wide-plank pine floorboards. The divorcee granddaughter making grits in the kitchen while Junior shoots cats in the barn. And papa sitting alone, putting his nightly 12-pack to bed, mumbling regrets over friends long dead. And while none of that (almost none of that) specifically appears in these stories, these character types fall flat not from overburdened characterization, but from a sort of enforced authorial isolation - as if they were the product of a writer producing character studies to be used in some future story. Like a child's peel-and-paste sticker book, they could be stuck into any and every fictional locale, yet seem to beg organic inclusion into the setting written specifically for them. These characters tend to exist, to act as if there were no one around to interact with, to converse solely within their own heads. It could be they're laconic or simply lonely, but these Southerners don\u2019t talk all that much, and when they do they sound like they\u2019re delivering lines \u2013 their stories just so much well-crafted exposition, setting us up for action that never comes.It\u2019s not that these tales of industrial murder, not-so-civil disobedience, a birthday rhinoceros, and the hint of hot-wife swapping are uninteresting, but they are somehow static \u2013 resigned to the inertia of the lives they chronicle. So clean, so meticulously drawn, down to the suitably bad choices they will all eventually make.Two exceptions from the frustrations of this literary inertia are well worth mentioning: the delightfully menacing \u201cBallad of Duane Juarez\u201d and the title story, more a novella, \u201cPoachers\u201d. Perhaps because they are less concerned with their characters\u2019 internality, affording us plenty of action to weigh against its possible motivations, but more, I think, because these deeply tragic stories expertly keep the tension at a low simmer, their reveal coming late, coming sharp.Imagine what American fiction in general would look like without the brilliance of Southern fiction \u2013 without Welty, Faulkner, O\u2019Connor, Gay, McCarthy, and this writer, Tom Franklin. Pretty depleted. Now imagine the choice between NO Southern fiction, and Southern fiction that\u2019s just good enough. \"Poachers\", despite its unevenness, despite its hesitance to reveal the horrors and take the risks we expect from the best writers of the American South, is more than \u201cgood enough\u201d; it\u2019s a worthy addition to your Southern list. It\u2019s a set of stories akin to moonshine: even when it\u2019s not great, it\u2019ll still put hair on your chest. But when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s - damn, boy! sit down and get your breath \u2013 so fine."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11686671-mike", "userReview": "Poachers by Tom Franklin is gloomy, bleak, melancholy\u2026 A kind of Southern Gothic noir, dark, at times brooding, offering no excuses and asking no forgiveness. The people in Franklin\u2019s tales are living lives of quiet (and sometimes not so quiet) desperation, they know that the best times are likely behind them because, as it says on a sign nailed to a tree in one of these stories, Jesus is not coming. Not for them.This collection is made up of ten stories of varying length, and one essay that serves as an introduction to the world that author Tom Franklin will be opening up to the reader. It is the nature of short stories that they can sometimes be insubstantial - the space doesn\u2019t allow for great character development so often a short will strive to set a tone and that\u2019s it - like momentary snapshots of a greater tale that goes untold. That is the case here, some of these short stories are poignant and will stick with a reader for days afterwards, others are just not substantial enough to stay with you after reading. I am not saying they are not good stories, there isn\u2019t what I would consider a bad one in the bunch, but some are better than others. -- introduction * hunting yearsThe author returns to what used to be the family property, long since sold off, so that he can touch base with the land of his youth, the place that informed and inspired the man he would become and the stories - these stories - that he would write to both honor and vindicate his homeland. He ruminates on his own experiences, on his connection - and need to reconnect - to the place that spawned these stories, on the passing of what once was into what it has now become.-- gritThe inept boss of a grit mill on the verge of shutting down can never quite seem to get ahead, then he gets caught up in a shifty deal that virtually insures he never will.-- shubutaA man at a time in his life when nothing seems to be going his way. His favorite uncle lies in a hospital bed, probably dying, his new girlfriend has left him, and he has been having serious thoughts of suicide\u2026 or maybe they aren\u2019t that serious. -- triathlonRelates the story of a man who is living the remnants of an American Dream that never really got started. Touching base, from time to time, with an older, more worldly friend - a runner - who pops in and out of his life at irregular intervals.-- blue horsesTwo friends on an early morning mission of mercy of sorts. Going through the motions while never acknowledging what it is they are about. -- the ballad of duane juarezThe older ne\u2019er do well brother who lives in the shadow of his younger well-to-do brother who married for money. -- a tiny historyWe meet several of the characters from triathlon in earlier, semi-happier times. -- dinosaursDoes the title refer to the fossil fuels that provide a living to the main character? To his aging, memory impaired father? To the crotchety gas station owner who would just as soon see him drive off the face of the earth? To he, himself, working in a job he is overqualified for and feeling the chill of middle-age breathing down his neck?-- instinctA man named Henry, in his late 30s, lives with his parents and makes enigmatic plans for someday...and then, it seems, someday may have come.-- alaskaTwo plant workers dream of chucking it all and hitting the road to Alaska, like two little boys dreaming of the fancy cars they\u2019ll have when they grow up. -- poachersBy far the star of this collection. The three Gates brothers are second generation poachers who are more part of the woods they hunt than civilization. Orphans since the oldest was 14-years old they have a friend and surrogate father of sorts in Kirxy, an old man who runs a store/outpost. More animal in many ways than men, through circumstances of their own making they find themselves at odds with a legendary game warden who is out for a reckoning.This book contains strong language, adult situations and violence. I would recommend it to any fan of the genre known by a variety of labels such as Country Noir, Hick Lit, or Grit Lit. Anyone looking for a quick, easy,happy, pick-me-up type of read will be greatly disappointed."}, {"userName": "Snotchocheez", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez", "userReview": "Tom Franklin's first book: \"Poachers\" (a collection of short stories tied together with the theme of poaching in its various forms) became required reading after I was blown away by his grisly account of the Mitchem Beat War in post-Civil War southern Alabama in his novel \"Hell at the Breech\". It certainly doesn't disappoint. To the contrary, it presages an amazing storytelling talent. Mr. Franklin possesses a keen talent for conveying mood and and emotion through raw realism, a talent few writers have, and certainly strive to attain. That Franklin achieves it with his first published book is eye-opening, if not jaw-dropping.It's probably no secret that Alabama (and many of the southern US states) is where the the country's remaining manufacturing sector has primarily relocated to, due to its low wage base. Franklin's stories (while not time-specific) are primarily based in present day Alabama, with the rural Alabamian working class as his character base, and the underlying despair attendant to this sector of the country is poignant, no matter what part of the country you live.Franklin's gritty realism is not for everyone. Those with a weak stomach probably should avoid this (or \"Hell at the Breech\" for that matter). For the most part, Franklin's uber-realism rarely feels gratuitous or over-the-top; it feels like a necessary ingredient in concocting the perfectly-told tale. (However, one story, the name of which eludes me, something like \"The Ballad of Duane something or other\" really made me nauseous, and kept me from from giving this otherwise excellent collection a five star rating). I highly look forward to reading his most recent novel \"Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter\"."}, {"userName": "Ben Loory", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/171197-ben-loory", "userReview": "well-written, dark and surprising stories about a group of people i've never encountered in literature before (although they are at times somewhat reminiscent of (and much realer than) the cannibals in cormac mccarthy's The Road). bunch of uneducated guys in the woods shooting and skinning and eating things and often killing people by accident or on purpose. lots of bones and dogs and mud and liquor; very few women and nothing approaching a love story. this is some dark stuff, though never cartoonish or gothic. the prose itself is what i would call propulsive, hurtling along and through the story, pushing the unimportant stuff aside and always headed straight to the end of the story which is also of course the heart of the matter. and yet at the same time every sentence is finely crafted and beautiful. my favorite parts were the story \"the ballad of duane juarez\" and the last bit, a novella called \"poachers.\" thanks, brian."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2030264-mel", "userReview": "This contained several short stories by the author Tom Franklin. I enjoyed almost all of them. The ones I especially liked were Grit, Shubuta, Dinosaurs, and the story the book got its name after Poachers. All of them were dark, violent and alcohol fueled. Some of them were hard to read but the way they were written just kept me riveted. I especially liked Poachers. It was the longest story and the best. Not all of the stories are winners; some of them I did not care for but this book still rated high and made my best reads list. I think it was because of the over all feeling of this book. It was dark and sweaty and pissed off and drunk and very violent and going for your jugular yet it was beautifully written all at the same time. It made my skin crawl in parts and made me wish I was there taking it all in even if it would scare the hell out of me in other parts.

I have gone back to my roots with this one. I \"discovered\" American regional short fiction 20 years ago and my favorite region is the south. It's all so very Gothic. Spanish moss and kudzu, Appalachia and Gulf coast, alligator and Thoroughbred, Pentecostal and voodoo priestess, plantation and slave quarter. One gets the idea that the primeval is alive and lurking in Mississippi. The juxtapositions of the South are mind-boggling and Tom Franklin captures them superbly. Mr. Franklin is a talent on the same plane with the late Larry Brown, and both are heirs to Faulkner.These are my favorite stories:The Ballad of Duane Juarez is about the dissolution of an older brother who has to rely on (or mooch off of) his younger brother's life. These are some of the things Duane accepts and/or takes from his brother Ned: food, drink, rent, Playboy, girls, jobs, electricity. According to Duane he married for love and Ned married for money. Duane's wife divorced him and so the love went away and their was still no money. Ned is still married and still has money so he tries to \"help\" his big brother Duane. I get the idea Ned sort of likes this arrangement. He doesn't seem to be intentionally belittling, but his off-hand remarks could be seen as casually cruel, as he tosses crumbs to Duane in the form of day-labor assignments. Some of the things that Ned has Duane do for him include: mowing grass, raking leaves, washing his car, cleaning houses, killing cats. Yep, killing cats. Ned's wife Nina feeds a bunch of stray cats and they won't go away. Ned hates the cats and pays Duane to capture them, take them off and shoot them. We find out how Duane feels about the people in his life when he takes the cats off to be summarily executed and starts naming them. This story is not a story with a plot, but is a character study. We get to peer around inside Duane's head, and he needs a good therapist.Poachers is the story of the 3 Gates brothers living in the backwoods of Alabama, who make their living as poachers. There's apparently nothing they won't kill and sell. This includes: fish, deer, dogs, rabbits, possums, turtle, fox. The brothers sell and barter (sometimes for moonshine, white lightnin, bad idea) the fruits of their hunt to regular customers in a netherworld that you have to see to believe, some of these places are so isolated they are accessible only by river; no electricity, no phone, no plumbing. The boys have been on their own since their father shot himself when the youngest brother was 12. He was despairing his wife's death in childbirth and the stillborn baby. So he buried them in the backyard. There is no law here.The boys live in a ragged cabin deep in the woods; have never gone to school; can't read or write; don't bathe; eat with their hands; have no social skills; never go to town. What they understand is the instinctual. This is Deliverance, second generation. This is the sort of thing that makes the hair on my neck stand at attention. You know what creeps me out? These people have to introduce new blood every so often and so what woman do they kidnap for their nefarious purposes? Eew.OK, anyway, the Gateses seem to be successfully skirting the edge of the cliff until the day they murder a game warden who caught them with a telephone rig in the bottom of their boat and tried to arrest them. Then they fell off the cliff. A few days later the body of the game warden is found. The sheriff calls the state wildlife commission to report the death and talks to a legendary warden by the name of Frank David, who is ascribed supernatural powers, happens to have been the dead warden's teacher and mentor. When the Gates brothers start showing up dead one by one, the sheriff knows Warden David's handiwork but cannot build a case, prove anything or even find him. An old shopkeeper named Kirxy had known their father and has spent years trying to help the brothers. He tried to house them, feed them, send them to school, to no avail. He had to finally return them to their cabin because his wife was as freaked out as I am, see? So when Kent, the oldest brother, and Neil, the middle brother, are murdered Kirxy tries to protect Dan, the youngest. We are given a few hints in the story that it may yet be possible to save Dan. Maybe.So please read this book. It will not appeal to everyone but I'd like to encourage you to venture out of your comfort zone. I love the short story form but I didn't know that until I ventured."}, {"userName": "Craigtator", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7366771-craigtator", "userReview": "A good example of Hillbilly Gothic.

I sensed some stories were Franklin trying to find his voice, and succeeding by the time I reached the Poachers novella. He holds back and builds drama by slowly revealing character facts and motivations. Suspecting also that my heightened expectations hindered my reading, feeling like an obese rich man at the table not appreciating his wealth and seeking perfection. Not a place I normally want to be, but having read much of the \"masters\" in country noir it was hard to avoid. Particularly I enjoyed his forward about losing his family \"place\" and dealing with touristy hunters who have no appreciation of history and nature. But Franklin is a true workingman's writer, self-taught to some extent like Larry Brown, and giving voice to what he knows. More character development is something I'll expect from his other novels, and I will read them. Picked up \"Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter\" when in Boston, having read \"Poachers\" on vacation in Cape Cod, a world apart from the characters in the deep south he writes so beautifully about. I found Franklin's interweaving of characters between stories akin to Carver, who tells his tales by actions and what people do, not what they think (hence the character development challenge). There's much to like here, especially if you are new to the genre and care to get into the world of the poor, the proud, and the southern mindset without the tired cliques. P.S. the story about the environmental inspector who redeems himself by infracting the law to give respite to two failing old men (father figures, one literal) was a tidy little piece that shows his breadth in storytelling, not just formulaic country (sic) noir.
