We gamble. Some do it at the gaming table, some do not. You play, you win, you play, you lose. You play.\" Jeanette Winterson is one of those authors I am constantly surprised at. \"The Passion\" is my favourite so far (update: before reading Sexing the Cherry, which is even more fascinating). There is something magical in her way of weaving the stories of her characters, and showing different angles of the central theme: passion. I do generally not like historical fiction, but in this case, the setting in Napoleonic Europe adds tremendously to the ideas she develops - in her own, very special language. One main thought, repeated several times over the course of the story, haunts me ever since I read it for the first time: \"Between fear and sex is passion\". That strikes me as the sad truth of the human condition, a valid explanation for many women's choice to trust themselves to violent, unreliable men. Those men represent such stuff as dreams are made on, and nightmares as well.To save themselves, the protagonists have to make the decision to renounce the passion that is too hurtful to endure. Beautiful fiction!

It was an intense and disorienting experience. Boundaries break down: you touch the stranger who guides you to your seat, talk to invisible people sitting beside you (how un-English!), can\u2019t judge or be judged by looks or clothing, and are tempted to eat with your fingers, despite the cutlery you feel before you. Phones and even watches must be locked away before you enter, so you lose sense of time as well as place.Deprived of vision, your other senses are more intense. But surprisingly, this makes it harder to recognise what you are eating, not easier. You taste a medley of familiar (and delicious) flavours, but their individual identities are oddly elusive. Names only spring to mind where shape or texture are unique (scallops, figs, and pomegranate seeds).Reading this early Winterson was similar. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a good book, and I\u2019m not even sure I understood it, but it was a rich, kaleidoscopic, and confusing carnal feast that I enjoyed.\u201cI like the early dark. It\u2019s not night. It\u2019s still companionable\u2026 Real dark is thicker and quieter, it fills up the space between your jacket and your heart\u2026 the Dark only lets you take one step at a time. Step and the Dark closes round your back. In front, there is no space for you until you take it. Darkness is absolute. Walking in the Dark is like swimming underwater except you can\u2019t come up for air\u2026 Lie still at night and Dark is soft to the touch.\u201d Masked kiss - image source: http://www.holidaypirates.com/media/i...Not the PlotThis is set in the Napoleonic wars, and told in four parts: The Emperor (narrated by Henri, a kitchen hand and faithful server of Bonaparte), The Queen of Spades (narrated by Villanelle, a web-footed, Venetian boatman\u2019s daughter who cross dresses, works in a casino, and picks pockets), The Zero Winter (French troops trudging through Russia, narrated by Henri), and The Rock (set in Venice, and narrated by both). But the reading experience is not really about a linear narrative with its sprinkling of magic and occasional forays into the philosophy of passion and love.Just indulge your senses. That\u2019s what Venice requires. That's what passion demands.Invented, Magical, Invisible City?Venice is portrayed as invented, magical, invisible and more, and hence reminded me strongly of Calvino\u2019s Invisible Cities:\u2022\tIn the introduction, Winterson explains, \u201cMy own cities were invented; cities of language, cities of connection, words as gang-ways and bridges to the cities of the interior where the coin was not money, where it was emotion.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cArriving at Venice by sea, as one must, is like seeing an invented city rise up and quiver in the air. It is a trick of the early light to make the buildings shimmer so that they seem never still.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cThere is a city surrounded by water with watery alleys that do for streets and roads and silted up back ways that only the rats can cross.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cThis is the city of mazes. You may set off from the same place to the same place every day and never go by the same route.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cAlthough wherever you\u2019re going is always in front of you there is no such thing as straight ahead.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cThe city I come from is a changeable city. It is not always the same size. Streets appear and disappear overnight, new waterways force themselves over dry land.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cI come from the city of mazes\u2026 but if you ask me a direction I will tell you straight ahead.\u201d\u2022\t\u201c\u2019I need a map.\u2019 \u2018It won\u2019t help. This is a living city. Things change.\u2019\u201dLiturgyThis is a strange, mystical, and eponymously passionate book, with recurring lines that are almost liturgical. Sometimes the exact same word or phrase is repeated, but other times they weave a subtly different route every time, like the enchanted streets and canals of the city itself, especially these variations:\u2022\t\u201cSomewhere between fear and sex passion is. Passion is not so much an emotion as a destiny.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cSomewhere between the swamp and the mountains. Somewhere between fear and sex. Somewhere between God and the Devil passion is and the way there is sudden and the way back is worse.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cMan cannot live without passion. Religion is somewhere between fear and sex.\u201d\u2022\t\"In between freezing and melting. In between love and despair. In between fear and sex, passion is.\"Passion is... elusive, but where IS it? Everywhere, nowhere, or in a parallel realm?THE PassionJohn 15:13 \u201cGreater love has no one than this: to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends.\u201dThe title has the definite article (\u201cThe Passion\u201d, not just any old passion), which makes one think of Jesus\u2019 crucifixion. Winterson\u2019s infamous Pentecostal upbringing (Oranges are Not the Only Fruit and Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?) means this is no accident, and yet the connection is more subtle than the title leads you to expect. There are Biblical allusions (some think Bonaparte might be the Son of God, and like Samuel, \u201cHe\u2019ll call you\u201d) and references to \u201cbasking\u201d in the glow of a church or religion you don\u2019t believe in, but most of the passion is fiercely carnal.Kaleidoscopic CornucopiaWith a browser and laptop, you'll see key words in bold; with a phone app, I don't think you will.\u2022\t\u201cSurely a god can meet passion with passion?\u201d\u2022\t\u201cWe\u2019re a lukewarm people.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cThey say that every snowflake is different.

The Passion is perhaps one of the most amazing stories I have ever read. It is not so much a novel as a journey through the mind and soul of Henri and Villanelle, through the real and ephemeral Venice, through history and imagination. While containing a solid narrative, it delves into the psyche and spirit of the writer and her characters. Read it once and you are trapped. Read it twice and you gladly relinquish your freedom. The story follows Henri, cook and horse groomsman for Napoleon Bonaparte, as the conqueror's army moves across Europe and Henri discovers that life is so much more than working for the highly particular self-styled overlord. We also meet Villanelle, a wonderful Venetian who makes gender seems as fluid as the water in the canals of La Serenissima. Through the consequence of Fate these two meet at one point, and their lives, strange and wonderful already, are never to be the same. In the midst of it all, Love is explored as a force of creation and destruction, as that unique impetus that can make or break a person, and how it is all one and the same. This is the fourth time I have read it, and every single time it casts the same spell on me, sucking me into the world that the pages, only letting me go after a fierce struggle. What I love about The Passion is that, after four times around the block, it still captivates and surprises me. With each reading, it reveals a new layer you did not see the time before, and only hints at all the wonderful mysteries it still holds for you. It is exhilarating to think that there is so much still waiting for me there, whenever I come back. And come back to it I will... This is a book that is not so much read as experienced; by the time the last page is turned, you are a different being. Revel in it.May 16, 2013: Read it overnight, a fifth time, and still love it as much as ever."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Jeanette Winterson pops up from time to time on BBC political debate programmes and she is like a laser beam of sensibleness, from a decidedly rad-lesbian perspective she cuts through the waffle and she's a joy to hear, Germaine Greer's punkier young sister maybe.

Winterson reminds me a bit of Angela Carter here-not that they write in the same way, but in that they use magic and intertextuality in similar ways, and that each have a very blunt aesthetic that hits the reader's gut with a great deal of force.I had to restrain myself and make sure I wasn't highlighting every last word-for they're all powerful, and I often found myself reading passages aloud to anyone close enough to listen. Henri and Villanelle are close enough to touch, the language is startling, the inquiries are brilliant, and the landscapes grab hold of you and don't let go.

Jeanette Winterson is one of my most read and reread authors if we\u2019re not counting that one YA Fantasy writer that I\u2019m complete trash for. The Passion is quite an emotional read and although I was not a fan of Henri\u2019s POV, I could understand his obsession with romantic love and its transforming powers. I think we see that in Winterson\u2019s other books, it was just weird to read it from a male perspective. Villanelle, the gambler who loses her heart to the Queen of Spades, might be described as bisexual, although her fluidity and her cross-dressing subvert gender identities and boundaries not in the sense of hiding one\u2019s sex, but in the way of challenging the male/female, truth/disguise, inner/outer binaries. I can see where the narrative voice of Written on the Body came about. It makes me want to reread it!I read Villanelle\u2019s character more as a comment on sexual identity, desire, and gender performance, while Henri\u2019s narrative was as a postmodern construct through and through. Taking on themes such as history and war, experience and passion, one you can dissect to no end if we throw metafiction into the game. Which I won\u2019t, however much temped\u2026 I will say that I particularly liked the way he portrayed his mother and his comments on the war\u2019s dehumanizing of women (\u201cEven the women without ambition wanted something more than to produce boys to be killed and girls to grow up to produce more boys\u201d), particularly in the way the army treats the women brought in the camps. Winterson takes apart Henri\u2019s masculinity, portraying him as a sensitive character with a distaste for war\u2019s aggressions. There are recurring themes and motives: \u2662 the metamorphic, living Venice, the central topos of the book, the city of madmen and disguises, the city of mazes, ever so slippery, the city of beauty, sex, and decay, the city of Satan; \u2662 the telling of stories about the human body and the human mind, about love and war and God (\u201cStories were all we had\u201d); \u2662 the idea of the \u201ccities of the interior\u201d unmappable, mysterious; \u2662 the relation between past, present, and future, unsettling the linear temporality; \u2662 the traveller\u2019s narrative, both masculine and feminine; \u2662 disputing the notion that women have no place in the patriarchy\u2019s map of the world or in the making of history. After all, \u201cthe women, they're always the clever ones\u201d.There are so many great quotes to take from this book, the writing is beautiful, while the structure of the novel and the way everything is wrapped up is just brilliant. When I read a novel set in Venice, I usually roll my eyes to no end, but The Passion is a totally different story. ** Buddy read with the lovely Swaye ***\u201cI was happy but happy is an adult word.

It\u2019s not long, and it\u2019s an easy read (you don\u2019t need to be a literary critic to enjoy it!), but the style and world are so marvellous, I wanted to linger. There is history and love, but it\u2019s not a historical romance. In spite of some magical realism, it\u2019s not really a fantasy either. In those days, unusual or exceptional talents may have been attributed to magic, so the lines between what\u2019s supposed to be real and what the characters have imagined are pretty blurry. It\u2019s the very early 1800s, when Napoleon is rising to power and sacrificing his troops to foreign armies and the Russian winter. Our hero, Henri, adores him and has caught the great man\u2019s eye, so he works in the \u201ckitchen\u201d (tent), where he gets a bit of food and warmth, while anyone who\u2019s managed to escape horrific slaughter on the battlefield starves and freezes to death instead.Meanwhile, Villanelle, our heroine (the author takes us back and forth), the wild young daughter of a Venetian boatman, roams the casinos, the alleys, and along the canals of Venice, picking pockets, carousing, and attracting trouble. She has inherited the webbed feet characteristic only of boatmen\u2019s sons, which may account for her habit of cross-dressing and her unique talent for navigating the shifting canals and hidden streets. Of course, Henri and Villanelle eventually cross paths. Their stories are full of love and loathing, revenge and murder, and although there are no happy endings, there are some understandable, satisfying conclusions. Winterson\u2019s writing is exceptional. Here, you can see that even our mysterious heroine, in spite of her special senses, is not immune to the terrors of the night.  \u201cI like the early dark. It\u2019s not night. It\u2019s still companionable. . . I don\u2019t know why it is that one kind of dark can be so different from another. Real dark is thicker and quieter, it fills up the space between your jacket and your heart. It gets in your eyes. When I have to be out late at night, it\u2019s not knives and kicks I\u2019m afraid of, though there are plenty of those behind walls and hedges. I\u2019m afraid of the Dark. You, who walk so cheerfully, whistling your way, stand still for five minutes. Stand still in the Dark in a field or down a track. It\u2019s then you know you\u2019re there on sufferance. The Dark only lets you take one step at a time. Step and the Dark closes round your back. In front, there is no space for you until you take it. Darkness is absolute. Walking in the Dark is like swimming underwater except you can\u2019t come up for air.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "2 stars for the phantasmagorical imagery and the story. 1 more star for the beautifully done ending and the immensely quotable lines on love and passion the writer seems to have clumsily crammed in to the narrative in the last few pages."}, {"userName": "Jo (A rather Bookish Geek )\u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-jo-a-rather-bookish-geek", "userReview": "\"Somewhere between fear and sex passion is.

That sounds pretty dull right? Wrong!! Winterson's writing style is captivating and unique, and it's not alike to anything I've read before. She explores gender, sexuality, passion and with this she expertly combines magical realism, some slight humour and historical fiction.This is such an unusual read. Some may even call it an oddity. Considering Winterson was not even thirty years old when she wrote this, I am hugely impressed.

The novel is exquisitely written and while chunks of it felt heavier then necessary, the language itself is too beautiful to ignore. It has an alluring sense of calm that draws the reader into the streets of Europe and even though it barely 200-pages, the historic setting felt truly authentic even when it\u2019s really not. Winterson maintained a balance between setting, story, and characters without any parts feeling clumpy.I loved Henri\u2019s perspective lot more then Villanelle, mostly because Henri felt a lot more tangible then Villanelle\u2014as I think it might have been intended. Both narratives, and characters, complemented each other really well and despite the odd nature of their relationship, they work well in their partnership.Winterson\u2019s exploration of history, disillusionment, passion, love, sexuality, and gender are boldly commented upon throughout the book but she also gives the reader a lot to think about on their own. There are short sentences in between paragraphs that hit the key note of the discussion perfectly. Magic is also interspersed throughout the story and despite it\u2019s nature to awe and distract, it adds a lot to what the themes try to portray.Even though for a few days I forgot I was reading this, when I finished it I was kind of blown away by it.

I continue to be impressed the more I immerse myself in her works. This is my fourth book of hers and she is slowly climbing up the ladder to my list of favorite authors. To say that I am completely astonished and mesmerized with The Passion would be an understatement. I am blown away. Its surrealistic, portable, and mythical sense of narrative create a world I find myself deeply invested in. I do not know a lot about the Napoleonic wars and gambling nor am I familiar enough with the streets of Paris and the canals of Venice but reading this little book transported me to its rivers and pavements. It's as if I can touch the waters, a sleight of hand with my own fingers and see the loneliness on Henri's face. Winterson's prose is beautiful, at times funny, it develops as her well-layered characters change together with the passage of time. She writes as if she knows love so well that you want to be in love yourself amidst all its foolishness. It is melancholic, painfully honest and it bends the nature of truth as fantasy and reality meet then finally get lost in each other. Nobody here stays in one place, hearts get stolen, the scars stay, people hurt each other, they kill for nothing, they gamble and love isn't always forgiving and is seldom generous; all of these are happening around us.The first five-star book of 2018 (and I hope won't be the last).Winterson's brilliant words shone through, resonated immensely, and I'm sharing some of them below:** \"Perhaps all romance is like that; not a contrast between equal parties but an explosion of dreams and desires that can find no outlet in everyday life. Only a drama will do and while the fireworks last the sky is a different colour.\"** \"Adults talk about about being happy because largely they are not. Talking about it is the same as trying to catch the wind. Much easier to let it blow all over you.\"** \"Time is a great deadener. People forget, grow old, get bored.\"** \"They say every snowflake is different. If that were true, how could the world go on? How could we ever get up off our knees? How could we ever recover from the wonder of it? By forgetting. We cannot keep in mind too many things. There is only the present and nothing to remember.\"** \"Does it matter whom you lose to, if you lose?\"** \"I used to think that darkness and death were probably the same. That death was the absent of light. That death was nothing more than the shadow-lands where people bought and sold and loved as usual but with less conviction.\"** \"The future is foretold from the past and the future is only possible because of the past. Without past and future, the present is partial. All time is eternally present and so all time is ours. There is no sense in forgetting and every sense is dreaming. Thus the present is made rich. Thus the present is made whole.\"** \"Is this freedom delicious because rare? Is any respite from love welcome because temporary? If she were gone for ever these days of mine would not be lit up. Is it because she will return that I take pleasure in being alone?\"** \"I didn't know what hate felt like, not the hate that comes after love. It's huge and desperate and it longs to be proved wrong. And every day it's proved right it grows a little more monstrous. If the love was passion, the hate will be obsession. A need to see the once-loved weak and cowed and beneath pity. Disgust is close and dignity is far away. The hate is not only for the once loved, it's for yourself too; how could you ever have loved this?\"** \"Do all lovers feel helpless and valiant in the presence of the beloved? Helpless because the need to roll over like a pet dog is never far away. Valiant because you know you would slay a dragon with a pocket knife if you had to.\"** \"Pleasure and danger. Pleasure on the edge of danger is sweet. It's the gambler's sense of losing that makes winning an act of love.\"** \"To love someone else enough to forget about yourself even for a moment is to be free.\"** \"My passion for her, even though she could never return it, showed me the difference between inventing a lover and falling in love.The first one is about you, the other about someone else.\""}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "3.5/5So this one had its good and its bad, places where the unconventional prose worked beautifully and other places where it ran off the tracks. Now, this kind of historical fiction, filled with magical descriptions of far off places that are so much more engaging than real life, was my all-consuming love during my high school years. I have returned to this genre with many more books under my belt, and a much more critical eye for faults.The author enjoys her meaningful phrases, which were strewn about the pages like a generous handful of rose petals that had stained many concluding sentences with its rose tint of wisdom. Unfortunately, she was much too heavy handed with them, delivering too many of them awkwardly and often forsaking context for philosophical digression. I'm all for finding passages to take to heart in books, but thrusting it at me on a silver platter screaming 'Love Me!' is not going to do it. She also loved to say something and then repeat it, which after enough pages of these made for strings of sentences completely composed of phrases mentioned previously, necklaces made of beads dropped in the middle of the path. It can create a beautiful composition, but when repeated enough, it's possible to predict which motif is going to pop up next and attempt to mean something. In other words, it gets boring.Also, the lack of context and the overly experimental prose played havoc for many sentences, and I can think of at least one that I stared at for a while, hoping that I was interpreting it incorrectly. There was also a moment in the plot that was completely disconnected with what had come before, and no amount of flipping back and forth between the two events clarified things any further. I do have to give credit to the ending, whose unbearable bittersweet tone was perfectly matched with the author's writing style.

Trust meHow does one begin to review a tremendous piece of art? Where does one start from? A brief synopsis? A general praise for the wonderful and the evocative? The commendable characterisation, the enriched setting or the overwhelmed throbbing of heart the book leaves the reader with? Shall I commence with this story\u2019s grandeur, the marvellous pace which kept me at the edge of my hypothetical seat, unable to put it down, fearful of losing the moment which grasped all my senses? What about setting off with the breath-taking details of an intricate city I have lived in and loved since reading this book? Or begin with the vivacity in which this incredible story thrives in, the vibrancy of the living and the dead, the unadulterated passions, the boundless and cosmic aura of war striking its chords against a myriad of other sins? How is it that one day life is orderly and you are content, a little cynical perhaps but on the whole just so, and then without warning you find the solid floor is a trapdoor and you are now in another place whose geography is uncertain and whose customs are strange?\u201cThe Passion\u201d is a surrealistic romance novel at the centre of it all. It is peppered with Winterson\u2019s personal philosophy of futility of war and passion as a prerequisite for survival, no matter what odds are stacked against one. SynopsisThe novel is divided into four parts: 1.\tThe Emperor is narrated by Henri, from the battlegrounds. He is a simple-minded French soldier, disillusioned with his love and loyalty for Napoleon whom he serves as a personal waiter. To Henri\u2019s plain mind, notions of war, victory and nationalism are greatly romanticized. Under Napoleon\u2019s flagship hordes of men scuttle to get recruited in his army to fight for France, for freedom, for triumph and for peace. For Henri, passion is inextricably linked to nationalistic fervour. 2.\tThe Queen of Spades is narrated by Villanelle, from Venice, a city of mystical tunnels and strange mazes. She is a card-dealer by morning and pickpockets at night. A web-footed daughter of a boatman, she cross-dresses and seeks adventurous run-ins with her clients. For Villanelle, passion can be sought from love and carnal desires. Her yearnings are fulfilled through a hapless affair with a married woman. 3.\tThe Zero Winter brings forth Henri as a narrator once again as he along with Napoleon\u2019s battalion are slogging through violent wintry Russian terrain; braving cold, hunger, pain and death to win an illusory war. Henri and his old friend Patrick, a defrocked priest, happen to meet Villanelle by chance who narrates her misfortunes as to how she ended up with Napoleon\u2019s army as a prostitute. Henri is gravitated towards her as she brings him back to Venice. His disenchantment with war as a cradle for passion is transmuted into pure, unadulterated love for Villanelle.4.\tThe Rock recounts Henri\u2019s internment in a mental ward and Villanelle\u2019s untiring efforts to help him escape back to France.A Variety of PassionsIt was a romance. Perhaps all romance is like that; not a contract between equal parties but an explosion of dreams and desires that can find no outlet in everyday life. Only a drama will do and while the fireworks last the sky is a different colour. He became an EmperorWinterson weaves a myriad of passions in the tapestry of the novel, each passion with its own singular resonance and affectation. We have religious fervour conflicting with carnal appetites, we have love and adoration set up against revenge and murder, nationalistic zeal contrasted with appeal for humanity, desire for nostalgic expression pitted against acclimatizing to the present, freedom granted by love versus liberty promised through victory and finally, unrequited love set in contrast to reciprocated love.On War All folly, but I think if Bonaparte had asked us to strap on wings and fly to St James\u2019s Palace we would have set off as confidently as a child lets loose a kite.\u201cThe Passion\u201d deals with futility of war by first exploring the loyalties and innumerable faiths attached to its notion. Henri, a guileless man, has deep affinities with his hometown. Through his devotion for Napoleon he aims to discover what it means to be a Frenchman and what do ideas of liberty and victory mean for the French. We are a lukewarm people and our longing for freedom is our longing for loveHenri who does not want to simply exist, but live, finds the fervour of war as an example for passion in men. This blind commitment to sole leadership and authority eventually lends alteration to what men hold most sacred. Concepts such as victory and defeat, being the conqueror and the conquered can mould identities, personal and national both.New recruits cry when they come here and they think about their mothers and their sweethearts and they think about going home. They remember what it is about home that holds their hearts; not sentiment or show but faces they love. Most of these recruits aren\u2019t seventeen and they\u2019re asked to do in a few weeks what vexes the best philosophers for a lifetime; that is, to gather up their passion for life and make sense of it in the face of deathThe first chapter is peppered with Henri\u2019s musings on how men are ready to die at the Emperor\u2019s whim. They don\u2019t question the ideals set before them since the idol has already established himself as an ideal. Men die in large numbers, giving Napoleon validity to his claim to throne. Their deaths leave value of life almost negligible among army barracks, but it is the family back home who suffers the most. No one wants to be killed but the hardship, the long hours, the cold, the orders were things we would have endured anyway on the farms or in the towns. We were not free men. He made sense out of dullness.Traversing through violent Russian landscape, pursuing an abstract notion of victory over the Russians, Henri becomes increasingly disenchanted with his vocation and passion. His journals anticipate a pessimistic stance unbecoming of him. There\u2019s no such thing as a limited victory. Every victory leaves another resentment, another defeated and humiliated people. Another place to guard and defend and fearThe inanity of the act of war comes as a final surge of certainty for Henri, who not only begins to despise his condition and whereabouts but begins to abhor his idol Napoleon. Like strung puppets, the French have been played, all in order to fulfil some fantastical impulses of one man, one man for whom war is a perpetual truth. I had been taught to look for monsters and devils and I found ordinary peopleOn VeniceThis city was built on wit and wealth and we have a fondness for both, though they do not have to appear in tandem.Villanelle\u2019s account on her city of Venice is a thing of infinite beauty. As a reader I immediately fell in love with Venice, a city I have never physically travelled to, but through her vivid descriptions I\u2019ve lived and existed in. It\u2019s a city whose mazes befuddle me, the reeking sewers make me cringe in displeasure, the carnivals arouse in me trepidation and exhilaration simultaneously. It\u2019s a city where carnal tensions ferment, love agitates and pleasure is enigmatic for eternity. Forbidden lusts morph into heart-wrenching love, romantic affairs adapt to the looming threat of being overheard. Home to Villanelle, Venice soon becomes a refuge for the disheartened Henri who now finds definition to his passions transforming. One of my most favourite passages from the novel is an account by Villanelle on Venetian life thriving in darkness:I like the early dark. It\u2019s not night. It\u2019s still companionable. No one feels afraid to walk by themselves without a lantern. The girls sing on their way back from the last milking and if I jump out on them they\u2019ll shout and chase me but there\u2019ll be no pounding hearts. I don\u2019t know why it is that one kind of dark can be so different from another. Real dark is thicker and quieter, it fills up the space between your jacket and your heart. It gets in your eyesThe Dark only lets you take one step at a time. Step and the Dark closes round your back. In front, there is no space for you until you take it. Darkness is absolute. Walking in the Dark is like swimming underwater except you can\u2019t come up for air.And again:I love the night. In Venice, a long time ago, when we had our own calendar and stayed aloof from the world, we began the days at night. What use was the sun to us when our trade and our secrets and our diplomacy depended on darkness? In the dark you are in disguise and this is the city of disguisesI used to think that darkness and death were probably the same. That death was the absence of light. That death was nothing more than the shadow-lands where people bought and sold and loved as usual but with less conviction. The night seems more temporary than the day, especially to lovers, and it also seems more uncertain. In this way it sums up our lives, which are uncertain and temporary. We forget about that in the dayFor Villanelle Venice is a city of disguises, but for Henri Venice is a city of madmen.Not even Bonaparte could rationalise Venice. This is a city of madmen.In the second chapter, Villanelle portrays Venice as a city of infinite mazes, tunnels and canals. Each turn unveils a new face of the city, previously unexplored, unidentified and discreet. In the bowels of the city live the exiles from around the world who present a completely different lifestyle in respect to Venetians. Venice has an impenetrable veneer which conceals roots of its old history and mystique. For Villanelle, this immense spectacle of masquerade is but life and living itself. But for Henri, this parade of deception and discretion is overwhelming. He is devastated by advances towards his object of affection, and having been already struck by violence of war, he resorts to a life in the madhouse.We became an enchanted island for the mad, the rich, the bored, the perverted. Our glory days were behind us but our excess was just beginningAnother aspect of Venice brought to my attention by Villanelle are the bridges and their innate existence as the lifeblood of the city.We didn\u2019t build our bridges simply to avoid walking on water. Nothing so obvious. A bridge is a meeting place. A neutral place. A casual place. Enemies will choose to meet on a bridge and end their quarrel in that void. One will cross to the other side. The other will not return. For lovers, a bridge is a possibility, a metaphor of their chances. And for the traffic in whispered goods, where else but a bridge in the nightI push on, under the Rialto, that strange half-bridge that can be drawn up to stop one half of this city warring with the other. They\u2019ll seal it eventually and we\u2019ll be brothers and mothers.Bridges join but they also separate.On LovePassion is not so much an emotion as a destinyAh, where to begin? Winterson\u2019s portrayal of love in all forms is no less than transcendent. Her wonderful treatment of pure human emotions is sublime and unforgettable. From Henri being evaded by prostitutes throughout his stay with the army to being finally enamoured by one, from Villanelle\u2019s haunting affair with a married woman to her submission to a horrible man in matrimony which leads to her final deliverance \u2013 on every step love is dealt with caution and abandon. I say I\u2019m in love with her. What does that mean? It means I review my future and my past in the light of this feeling. It is as though I wrote in a foreign language that I am suddenly able to read. Wordlessly, she explains me to myselfLyrical ProseAs an incredibly strong, sensual and sensible piece of art, \u201cThe Passion\u201d has no end to beautiful, rich passages. Winterson\u2019s writing is exceptional and evocative. It arouses buried passions within the reader\u2019s heart and mind. I could find no end to highlighting passages, words threaded into splendid sentences, enthralling the five senses, as I caught myself time and time again being carried away by the profusely magnificent and vibrant narrative.How could we ever recover from the wonder of it? ConclusionThe crux of this novel tills the soil of passion in all forms and glory. The speculation of passion embodied in the spiritual, the sexual, the emotional and filial needs of humans is crafted with great grandeur and subtlety through the two main characters and their circumstances. Here the surreal is fused with the real to produce a beautiful fairy tale of sorts. Love is dealt with a melancholic intensity, witnessed with brevity in poetry. This novel is undoubtedly a force of dynamic interplay between love and tragedy. Highly recommended!

I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as previous offerings but it's short, highly imaginative and full of passion, both of the good and the bad kind. The two main characters are suitably unusual - we have Henri, a simple French lad, who joined up with Napoleons army because he fell in love with Napoleon. He didn't make it into battle though, he ended up cooking chickens for the great man throughout all of his time in the military. Once Henri decides that Napoleon isn't the man of his dreams after all (something he decides on the frozen plains of Russia with the rest of the army dying like flies around him) he falls in by chance with the lovely Villanelle, a duck footed Venetian who worked in the gambling halls in that mysterious city until a bad decision landed her in the same army as Henri, albeit with a different role to play. Once they meet, Villanelle brings Henri back to her home city of Venice where she wants them to live out their lives together. And this is where the book starts to get a little strange...Villanelle decides that has to go and retrieve her heart from a previous lover who has kept it locked up in her house - perhaps so that she can fully commit to her new love, Henri; tbh I wasn't entirely clear on what precisely was going on. Exactly who this lady was and whether she meant ill to Villanelle I wasn't sure. I'm not a big fan of magical realism and I thought that this was the weakest aspect of the book. Still, leaving it aside it was still enjoyable to read."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1671713-natalie", "userReview": "Parts of this unusual read are dark fairy tales, parts are fantasy. I can not even approach conjuring with any sincerity an honest review of the scenes of violence, love, need, meals and fantasy as make up The Passion.It is almost like a series of unbelieveable disconnected vignettes that the reader visits through a common hallway. I can't describe it except for to say that it is sort of like if  Gabriel Garcia Marquez had an older sister who went on tour with the GratefulDead and heard these stories from some crazy europen trippnig people in the car parks and relayed them to him, and then he wrote a story about what she said, and then Pedro Almod\u00f3var wrote a screenplay for Marquez's story, but Guillermo del Toro directed it. They are a weird tripartate to call upon for help because Winterson's stories are ever so loosely set in a period during and after the Napoleonic Wars in locales ranging between France, Venice, and Russia -about as far from Marquez, del Toro, and Almodovar as you can get? The author herself on her website warns that: \"The Passion isn't an historical novel. It uses history as invented space. The Passion is set in a world where the miraculous and the everyday collide. . . . This is the city of mazes . . . The Passion is about war, and the private acts that stand against war. It's about survival and broken-heartedness, and cruelty and madness.\""}], "description": "The Passion is a modern classic that confirms Jeanette Winterson's special claim on the novel. Set during the tumultuous years of the Napoleonic Wars, The Passion intertwines the destinies of two remarkable people: Henri, a simple French soldier, who follows Napoleon from glory to Russian ruin; and Villanelle, the red-haired, web-footed daughter of a Venetian boatman, whose husband has gambled away her heart. In Venice's compound of carnival, chance, and darkness, the pair meet their singular destiny. In her unique and mesmerizing voice, Winterson blends reality with fantasy, dream, and imagination to weave a hypnotic tale with stunning effects.", "title": "The Passion", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion?rto=x_gr_w_carousel_bp", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524520116l/39929534.jpg", "reviews": 1126, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9399.Jeanette_Winterson", "name": "Jeanette Winterson"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Magical Realism", "Lgbt", "Glbt"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15047.The_Passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15781961-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/879426.The_Passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15781962-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20872993-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8429885-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32805411", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1152792.The_Passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840770.The_Passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15055.Oranges_Are_Not_the_Only_Fruit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11395597-why-be-happy-when-you-could-be-normal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15054.Written_on_the_Body", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15050.Sexing_the_Cherry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15052.Lighthousekeeping"]}
