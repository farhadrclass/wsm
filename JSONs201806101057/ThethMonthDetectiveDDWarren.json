I don't read very many short stories but I had to read this because I have read all the other books in this series. This has been sitting on my Kobo shelf for a while now and I just had to commit to reading it, as well as the other two short stories which I will be reading soon. I rather enjoyed this. The murder mystery here isn't what actually grabbed my attention. D.D. and Alex's relationship is what is pretty special here. They are so perfect, fun and cute together. D.D. was also her sarcastic, witty, and humorous self here.Lisa Gardner is one of my favourite authors!"}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suzanne", "userReview": "My first ever audio book experience! Accents I think could be an issue for me with this type of reading. It's a voice I'm not used to and I kept thinking about it, listening to the nuances of the voice, not the story! Also, distraction - I kept doing things where I stopped listening. Nothing major, just would need to work on adjusting myself to stop and listen! My issue though of course..D.D is 29 weeks pregnant now, and relegated to a desk, reception no less! This is not good enough, and she's bored of course. She jumps, as much as her tummy will let her, at the chance to consult on a movie set on police procedures. Extra cash for her nursery, why not?! D.D is as quick as ever, lots of witty retorts. She's a great lead character.Alex returns, yay, I really liked him in the prior instalment - and he clearly is smitten with our hard to pin down leading lady - to help solve a crime that has just occurred in relation to the consultant who has mysteriously disappeared. Thus D.D's required presence on set. The exec producer that hired her is jumpy, something's not right and D.D is on the case!My unusual average rating for this one (and I do feel like I'm letting the team down here) is simply because I found it a tad corny, possibly not helped with the cookey accents when the narrator changed characters? No harm done though, can't wait for the next one, which by all accounts seems ominous due to the very last sentence. D.D, what's going on with you??"}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "2,5 starsThe 7th Month, book #5.5 in Lisa Gardner\u2019s Detective D.D.

D.D. is now seven months pregnant, several months have passed since the last novel Love You More, where D.D. found out she was pregnant by her boyfriend Alex. When we catch up with D.D. she's on desk duty for obvious reasons, and has just been asked by Alex to move in with him. Dead bodies and gruesome crime scenes don't make her bat an eye, but a man that's crazy in love with scares her to death. While on desk duty, a man comes in looking for a police consultant for a movie that's currently filming. It seems the last consultant has bolted or disappeared. Does D.D. know of anyone? Well boredom makes the decision for her and she heads out for the job. This was a quick mini mystery that had some nice twists to it but the best part was seeing her and Alex together. I love D.D.'s reaction to Alex when he comes on set to assist her! My heart skipped a beat right along with D.D's. This is a nice segue into the latest story. If you're a fan of the D.D.

I was 1 for 2, anyway. It was quick at least, though truth be told, I wish it had been shorter. I've never read, or in this case listened, to a murder mystery that bored me more than this one did. I could barely even bring myself to pay attention, which is bad because it's only an hour and 45 minutes long. I didn't really care about the characters, probably because I haven't read any of the other books in this series, and didn't know them. But my goodness, when D.D. practically creamed herself when her boyfriend showed up, I thought it was a bit much. You're 41 years old woman, not 16. Get a grip. Dang! And then the murder tips, which apparently were a blog? I get how they fit in, but it took me quite a while to realize that it wasn't D.D herself. THAT might have been interesting!

They're an interesting concept these 'short stories' between novels. And e-books. I'm not sure if it was reading an e-book, or the 'short story' itself that felt weird.

Know that she will find herself on the set of a crime movie giving police procedure advice to the actors. Right from the onset doubts arise with first news that the original advisor who was an ex cop was found beaten to death. Soon it is discovered the film is a sham to catch a crime boss who is launering money but who has killed the ex cop and why?lisa Gardner has overall done a really good job in describing an action packed day in D.D.'s life. Although not suprisingly it is alot more basic than the books in the series we still have a murder and the question of who did it. Add to it you have D.D. delicate state thanks to the advanced state of her pregnancy and the added unpredictabiltiy of the story that makes for a good quick read.

Warren is currently seven months pregnant. It's hard because instead of actually working, she's now a glorified receptionist at the police station. Which, yes, is still technically working, but when you're used to being a detective, it's really not. So she takes a well-paying consulting gig on the spur of the moment. It's a horror/suspense movie about a serial killer who murders widows with a chunk of tombstone. Except it turns out that the reason that they need a consultant is that someone killed the last one.I love Lisa Gardner's novels, but this novella didn't do it for me. Definitely don't judge her books on this, though; they're smart and creepy and wonderful. This story felt a little rushed (probably due to the fact that it's basically a short story and not a novel) and just not as good as her books normally are.I think part of my problem is that this felt similar to two different Laura Lippman books I've read. (In one, her PI becomes a consultant for a TV series and in another, the same PI---also pregnant---solves a crime.) And you can't outdo Laura Lippman.Her next novel comes out in February and I am very excited to read it. If you haven't read Lisa Gardner, you should definitely fix that.

In the alternating chapters you start with a checklist for how to plan and execute the perfect murder including method, alibi and cleanup. Interesting. A man comes to the Police Dept, asking for a detective. He's a movie producer and says he needs a detective to help on site of his new movie. They had a detective who apparently got his first big paycheck and took off on vacation. When the producer gives the payment he is offering, D.D. is intrigued, at 7 months pregnant, she can use the money. She arrives on set and starts asking around about the missing detective. It seems he was found dead that morning, bludgeoned with a blunt instrument. They soon realize there's big money in the movie business...as a form of money laundering. The problem arises when the producer has a gambling problem so when mob money is lost, well, there's soon hell to pay. When Alex, D.D.'s boyfriend and father of her baby, shows up and they confront the producer, telling him they know he killed the detective, as Alex proceeds to give blood spatter evidence proving he did, they're surprised to find out its the lead actress, whose boyfriend is on the other end of the mob money, who killed the detective when he decided to trade sex favors. In the final confrontation though, its D.D. and Alex's baby who steals the show when D.D.'s water breaks.

I always enjoy Gardner's books and her DD Warren character, and this short story shows how Gardner can quickly sculpt the mystery and wrap things up at the end. If you aren't too familiar with the characters, it may be hard for some to get into since DD is 'different' - sarcastic, witty, intelligent and struggles constantly with her personal life. Fun read!"}], "description": "In her seventh month of pregnancy, D.D. should be taking it easy. Instead, she accepts a small consulting role on the set of a serial killer film shooting in Boston.
