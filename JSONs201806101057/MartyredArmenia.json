Outspoken and strongly believing in an independent Arab State free of Turkey and supported by the West (sadly, we all know how that turned out!), Ghusein was put on trial for treason. He was acquitted, but exiled to Diyarbarkir, a region near the current Armenia. World War I had started its madness, and the Armenian Genocide was in full flow.The Armenians in Diyarbarkir were mostly wiped out. Ghusein provides an eyewitness account of it. However, the book is basically a pamphlet (which is what Ghusein himself calls it), and in no way provides a comprehensive look at the issue or even the author's own experiences. In just about 50 pages, the entire story of a people's genocide is told. It must have made a lot of sense to people during the time period it was written in, but all the names that Ghusein keeps throwing about has absolutely no meaning for most modern readers. Since there was no introduction to who these people were and what their contribution, positive or negative, was, I was left rather cold.Ghusein also consistently repeats that people should not mistake that Islam is a bad thing because of the Turks' behaviour. That sort of irked me a bit as I don't really see why that is even a concern when people are getting butchered all over the place. But hey, don't get my religion wrong! I understand the wider connotations of this issue, but in a 50 page narrative about murdered Armenians, a constant refrain of 'don't fault my religion' has no place, according to me.The anecdotes were the best part of this narrative. While journeying through the city, Ghusein came across strewn corpses, murdered children, raped women, and many other atrocities, some even taking place under his own horrified eyes. I do wonder why he was even outside during a civil war - it must have been super dangerous! The stories of these experiences is why this book is even relevant today."}, {"userName": "JoAnn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1287117-joann", "userReview": "Horrifyingly detailed genocide of Armenians and Christians by the Ottomen, Turks, Curds, etc., in the early 20th Century. I am having a hard time not breaking down completely. Entire families deported and murdered horrifically. Women and children sold for prices of \"old furniture.\" Slavery. Rape. \"Extermination.\"I wonder if we are doing the future a disservice by focusing so much on the Jewish Holocaust, that it seems an isolated event, rather than the best organized among so many. Would the future be better served knowing it happens too often and too easily and thereby be more aware of the warning signs?"}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3746195-nick", "userReview": "Ive been reading about various genocides to more familiarize myself with the general contours of the phenomenon. I don't really know what I can say about this. Obviously it has the standard things you would expect. Uncaring brutality of Turks and to a lesser extent Kurds on Armenians. Cruelty which is difficult to imagine. Slavery, rampant killing, pointless game-like cruelty. Rape as usual plays a large role in the genocide, although it seems possible to me that this author omits the full extent of the rape to be polite. I apologize for dwelling on this subject but it is fascinating in its horror and it is a key aspect of all genocides which interests me. We only know from the text that the rapes occur, or occasionally that they occur before the victim's family, that the victim commits suicide to avoid continued rape, or that the price of sex slaves is quite low, but we get little information about the sadism which normally characterizes such rapes in the midst of genocide. The author seems to want to preserve the honor of the victims by not mentioning too many details about the rapes, which I understand, but is not helpful to an aspiring historian. One thing which is somewhat unusual about this is that the Armenians seemed to be at a higher standard of general civilizational development (literacy, economic output per capita, etc) than either the Turks or the Kurds. In this sense the killers were \"punching up\" although obviously they were militarily superior. Im curious about how much the Armenians resent the Kurds in modern day as a result of their secondary participation in this horror. Like similar genocides in Islamic regimes, coerced conversion to Islam played a significant role, but like the Bengalis in 1971, this was not a very effective strategy for avoiding death and rape. With validity the author (A Muslim) points out that the Young Turk regime was actually fairly anti islamic and that this violence cannot be ascribed to Islamism, at least not directly. Nationalism is clearly the culprit here, with Islam playing a much less obvious role than it has in other genocides. I also wonder what modern Armenians think about the Armenians who did convert to Islam during this period. If they are seen as traitors, or if they are perceived with sympathy. I also wonder how they've handled the rapes. Have they talked about it more openly than this text does? Or do they feel that silence is the greater honor for their trauma?Why is it that rape plays such a huge role in genocides anyway? Somehow to rape the women of the opposite community is the most thorough way to defeat and destroy them. It is to destroy not only the current generation, but also their genome for time immemorial. To contaminate them with yourself, and to make them a part of you, though an inferior part. It is also to deprive that community of control over its own future. It is also to take control and do violence to the vessel of honor and purity of that community. Women have that association with purity and honor for the aforementioned reasons. They represent the future of the community in their childrearing capability. Amazing how mass rape has this effect. Not only does it traumatize the individual women in question and force rape babies upon the community, but it also forcibly cuckolds the entire community. The ultimate national and social humiliation which can only be repaid with blood, or worse. The most potent fuel possible for retaliatory nationalist violence. This is what I've gathered from various reading, it is not contained in this text.The author was an Arab if I remember correctly, so he has no real dog in this fight, except perhaps that he would wish to portray the Turks and to a lesser extent the Kurds as the villains which they so obviously are in this context. Nevertheless he does briefly give the Turkish angle on the story in the conclusion section before dismissing it as pure propaganda."}, {"userName": "Lu\u00eds Garcia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11134946-lu-s-garcia", "userReview": "(lido em Chengdu, China)"}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9655778-crystal", "userReview": "Though written not by a writer and not as a story -- more like an eyewitness account -- \"Martyred Armenia\" was very eye-opening. This year marks a century since the Turks (and perhaps some various other groups which the author alludes to) slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Armenians. A few weeks ago, I had never even heard of this genocide, but between \"Kardashians Take on Armenia\" drawing attention to the anniversary on the news and other personal events, I feel quite connected to this country now. This book has many graphic descriptions of the massacres, some unbelievable (like, am I not supposed to question that out of the thousands of Armenians he saw get murdered, not a single one begged for mercy, that they all met their deaths as if they were no big deal? Methinks the author's pride for his country got in the way). He also is quick to sever the connection between Islam and what happened, insisting that the Turks who used their same faith to justify the slaughter are wrong. Between this book and the Jamie Kennedy film, \"Lost & Found in Armenia,\" (available on Netflix; I liked it) we are certainly seeing that this small country has been through a lot!"}, {"userName": "Khadijah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/658925-khadijah", "userReview": "It's interesting that this eyewitness account of the Ottoman genocide of the Armenians was written by an Arab.

His accounts tell of the worst of humanity, and also of the noblest. The noble include families who courageously support each other in the face of death, and Turks who refuse to follow orders to kill, knowing that they shall be executed themselves for their defiance. The genocide occurred just before and during World War I, and estimates as to the number of people murdered range from one to one and a half million.
