It is the story of Handke's mother's suicide, and his rapid attempts to capture it and her life through writing. Handke is a strange, wonderful writer and I raced through the early part of this with pleasure, as he constructed a profile of his mother's life in Germany before her stagnancy set in. (I was particularly interested in how backgrounded WW2 was - Hitler, just a voice on the radio.)The writing about her death was beautiful as well, and strongly reminiscent of that magic scene in THE ARGONAUTS with Harry and his mother. Handke's relief, and the odd love that explodes out of him when alone with his mother's body, was touching and gratifying. And yet, for all that I liked, there are major holes in this work (the absent father; the step-father's abuse; some sort of compassion for his mother), and I found myself dragging through the middle third. What I was expecting to be a one day read took about a week, and though I think A.S.B.D. is pedagogically fascinating and of great use to writers, it struck me as something of a missed opportunity."}, {"userName": "Mike Puma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4193758-mike-puma", "userReview": "Briefly: In Jeffrey Eugenides introduction, readers are told, \u201cIn fact, German has two words for self-slaughter:  Selbstmord, which is roughly equivalent to the English \u201csuicide\u201d and Freitod, which means literally \u201cfree death,\u201d and possesses a certain brave, even heroic, connotation.\u201d This puts me in mind of the character of Jessie in Marsha Norman\u2019s unforgettable play, 'night, Mother, a play everyone should see, or read, or watch the Cissy Spacek/Anne Bancroft film.

A Sorrow beyond dreams is Handke's poignant account of his mother's life and death. Prosaic, poetic, elliptical and self-conscious, it is an exacting picture of the shock and grief that await those who have inherited the ruins of a suicide. Rarely in recent years has reading a mini masterpiece of just 76 pages had such a macro impact on my psyche.The Austrian writer Peter Handke is one the greatest and most original novelists and playwrights writing in German language today. My exposure to his prose dates back to early 90\u2019s when I was impressed with reading his novels like \u201c The Left-handed Woman\u201d and major plays such as \u201c The Ride Across Lake Constance\u201d. When another Austrian writer Elfriede Jelinek won Nobel Prize for Literature in 2004, I wondered why they didn't bestow it on Peter Handke, a writer much more worthy of that prize (Jelenik too voiced in an interview that Handke deserved it better than her. Btw, I read Jelinek\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Teacher\u201d last year and was impressed with her prose too) . Well, Handke may never win a Nobel as he has been a controversial figure due to his involvement in Balkan Conflict and being a sympathizer of Slobodan Milosevic.You can read this as a memoir or metafiction of a poor, sprightly and hearty woman in Austria, full curiosity and zest for life, who undergoes slow disintegration first due to the members of her family and the society around her (who chain her by not allowing to get education and gain independence) and then by the loveless relationships and associated miseries that drain her spirits and will to exist. Peter Handke narrates the story of his mother from a totally impersonal and disinterested perspective. There are only few places where Handke addresses the woman as \u201cMy mother\u201d, especially at the beginning : \u201cMy mother has been dead for almost seven weeks: I had better go to work before the need to write about her, which I felt so strongly at her funeral, dies away and I fall back into the dull speechlessness with which I reacted to the nerves of her suicide.\"Handke adopts for his composition a deliberate formulation based on facts and the way he gets into the different stages in her life may seem like reading a resume of one\u2019s life. He knows the vulnerability when writing about one\u2019s own mother and therefore exerts great restraint in not allowing the words to slip into sentimentality and histrionics. His minimalistic approach in narrating her dull life drenched in drudgeries can be perceived from this passage: \u201cFor a woman to be born into such surroundings was in itself deadly. But perhaps there was one comfort: no need to worry about the future. The fortune-tellers at our church fairs took a serious interest only in the palms of young men -a girl's future was a joke.No possibilities. It was all settled in advance: a bit of flirtation, a few giggles, a brief bewilderment then the alien resigned look of a woman starting to keep house again, the first children, a bit of togetherness after the Kitchen-work, from the start not listened to, and in turn listening less and less. Inner monologues, trouble with her legs, varicose veins, mute except for mumbling in her sleep, cancer of the womb, and finally, with death, destiny fulfilled. The girls in our town used to play a game based on the stations in a woman's life: Tired / Exhausted / Sick / Dying / Dead. \"Born in a small Austrian village in the 1920s, Handke's mother\u2014he keeps her nameless\u2014lived in a world constrained by history and convention. Unlike many cloistered women in her village, Handke\u2019s mother valiantly, though vainly, makes several attempts to streamline her life . She runs away from the soundless persecution at home, pursues a career at age fifteen, bears an illegitimate son (Peter Handke) from her first love \u2013 a saving-bank clerk who vanishes from her life as quickly as he emerges, marries a German army sergeant, and, after World War II, they settle in Berlin, where he works as a motor mechanic, who then degenerates into a drunkard subjecting her to routine torture. She bears a second child, aborts a third and grows old before her time. In 1948, they flee the eastern sector of the city and return to Austria, to the house where she was born . There she enjoys a brief spell of normalcy, picks up reading literature which turns out to be her true solace and involves herself in politics to regain her presence in society. Eventually, she succumbs to nervous breakdown brought up by the accumulated pain and slow atrophy of her life and finally blows it out with barbiturates. \"Squalid misery can be described in concrete terms,\" Handke writes; \"poverty can only be intimated in symbols.\" The torture of maintaining outward appearances and rituals in this \u2018hygienic poverty\u2019 is a deep undercurrent in the novel:\u201cFrom the first she was under pressure to keep up the forms: in country schools the subject most stressed for girls was called \u201cthe outward form and appearance of written work\u201d; in later life this found its continuation in a woman\u2019s obligation to put on a semblance of a united family; not cheerful poverty but formally perfect squalor; and gradually, in its daily effort to up appearances, her face lost its soul.\u201d\u201cChristmas: necessities were packaged as presents. We surprised each other with such necessities as underwear, stockings, and handkerchiefs, and the beneficiary said he had WISHED for just that! We pretended that just about everything that was given to us, except food, was a present; I was sincerely grateful for the most indispensable school materials and spread them out beside my bed like presents.\u201dA Sorrow Beyond Dreams grips us with Handke's unusual technique of compressed narration that succeeds to impart emotional intensity without emotionalizing the grey universe around her. He weaves a kaleidoscope by mixing memories, events, objects and casual statements . Passages are pregnant with irony too. Here are few examples:\"In general, these memories are inhabited more by things than by people: a dancing top in a deserted street amid ruins, oat flakes in a sugar spoon, gray mucus in a tin spittoon with a Russian trademark; of people, only separated parts: hair, cheeks, knotted scars on fingers; from her childhood days my mother had a swollen scar on her index finger; I held onto it when I walked beside her.\"\"Another way of listing would be equally idyllic: your aching back; your hands scalded in the wash boiler, then frozen red while hanging up the clothes (how the frozen washing crackled as you folded it up!); an occasional nosebleed when you straightened up after hours of bending over\u2026 the eternal moaning about little aches and pains, because after all you were only a woman. Women among themselves: not \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d but \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d\"At home, of course, she was alone with the FOUR WALLS, some of the bounces was still there; a hummed tune, a dance step while taking off the shoes, a brief desire to jump out of her skin. And then she was dragging herself around the room again; from husband to child, from child to husband, and from one thing to another.Fiction these days offers a lot of chaff, not in the case of this novel. Every paragraph or sentence in this memoir prompts one to pause, absorb, heave a sigh and then move forward with a lump in one's throat. Handke is a master in using syncopated sentences, one-liners, wrenching associations, cold enumerations and slots of silences which cumulatively deepen the impact of the tragedy.There is an intentional interlude at page 46 where Peter Handke as writer casts doubts on himself and questions whether his modus operandi of writing the memoir has any merit:\u201cThe danger of all these abstractions and formulations is of course that they tend to become independent. When that happens, the individual that gave rise to them is forgotten \u2013 like images in a dream, phrases and sentences enter into a chain reaction, and the result is literary ritual in which individual life ceases to be anything more than a pretext.These two dangers \u2013 the danger of merely telling what happened and the danger of a human individual becoming painlessly submerged in poetic sentences \u2013 have slowed down my writing, because in every sentence I am afraid of losing my balance. This is true of every literary effort, but especially in this case, where the facts are so overwhelming and there is hardly anything to think out.\u201d At the end, Handke recounts his flight home for the funeral and confesses: \"I was beside myself with pride that she had committed suicide,\" as if she had finally availed herself of the only freedom remaining to her. It is a stunning line. This is followed by two pages of aphoristic observations and his incapacity to separate him from the protagonist in narrating her life:\"It is not true that writing has helped me. In my weeks of preoccupations with the story, the story has not ceased to preoccupy me. Writing has not, as I at first supposed, been a remembering of a concluded period in my life, but merely a constant pretense at remembering, in the form of sentences that only lay claim to detachment. Even now I sometimes wake up with a start, as though in response to some inward prodding and, breathless with horror, feel that I am literally rotting away from second to second. The air in the darkness is so still that, losing their balance, torn from their moorings, the things of my world fly soundlessly about: in another minute they will come crashing down from all directions and smother me. In these tempests of dread, I become magnetic like a decaying animal and, quite otherwise than in undirected pleasure, where all my feelings play together freely, I am attacked by an undirected, objective horror.\"And the last line of the memoir accentuates his sense of incompleteness. \u201cSomeday, I shall write about all this in greater detail.\u201dConsidering that this memoir was written in 1972 when Handke was only 31, one marvels at the maturity, stylistic virtuosity and thematic integrity he has demonstrated in this magnum Opus. Elegant simplicity, purity and austerity- seldom encountered in prose these days- are the hallmarks of this work. I have now decided to get all his important works and start my new journey in the postmodern fiction of Handke.A Sorrow beyond dreams is a loving portrait of inconsolable grief, the story of woman whose lively spirit was crushed not once but over and over again by the miseries of her place and time. I underscore what W G Sebald said about Peter Handke : \u201cThe specific narrative genre he developed succeeded by dint of its completely original linguistic and imaginative precision, through which \u2013 in works such as The Goalie\u2019s Anxiety or A Sorrow Beyond Dreams \u2013 the author reports and meditates upon the silent catastrophes that continuously befall the human interior.\u201d  Conclusion: Highly recommended to all readers of postmodern fiction."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh", "userReview": "The half-lit room. The cream-colored paint on the walls reflecting barely enough light to see. The tiled floor, absent of dirt or dust. The cot which lies empty, barren and untouched. All of these circumstances, all of these facts can be taken as a symbol for the hurt, pain and utter emptiness Handke's mother felt as she grew to become, in her own words, nothing. \"And so she was nothing and never would be anything, it was so obvious that there was no need of a forecast. She already said, \"in my day,\" though she was not yet thirty. Until then, she resigned herself, but now life became so hard that for the first time she had to listen to reason. She listened to reason, but understood nothing.\" As she raises a child and is married to a man that she doesn't love, being beaten habitually and for being the unfortunate gender of a woman, she felt nothing anymore. She would laugh while being hit, she would smile when she felt depressed and her inner turmoil while being resigned, was passionate. Handke wrote this right after his mother's suicide and I can feel his love and angst and power within the pages as he struggles to know what to write, but eventually puts down raw emotion on paper, showing us who his mother was and why she did what she did, what was inevitable, what was needed.\"When I write, I necessarily write about the past, about something which, at least while I am writing, is behind me. As usual when engaged in literary work, I am alienated from myself and transformed into an object, a remembering and formulating machine. I am writing the story of my mother, first of all because I think I know more about her and how she came to her death than any outside investigator who might, with the help of a religious, psychological, or sociological guide to the interpretation of dreams, arrive at a facile explanation of this interesting case of suicide, but second in my own interest, because having something to do brings me back to life, and lastly because, like an outside investigator, though in a different way, I would like to represent this VOLUNTARY DEATH as an exemplary case.\"The emphasis of capital letters for certain words makes the reader relate to what is being said, relate in a way that the sorrow is constantly in the foreground, never being forgotten, never being set aside.This is her life in 100 pages.

Read a yellowed mass market paperback with a cartoon image of the author on the cover (Three by Peter Handke). Reread the novella in this snazzy < 75 pg. standalone edition -- for what felt like the first time really -- because Knausgaard recently mentioned it as a major influence. This straightforward yet essentially scene-less \"life story\" about Handke's mother's suicide gave Knausgaard a blueprint for how to write about his father's slow suicide by alcohol. (\"My painful memory of her daily motions, especially in the kitchen.\") Otherwise, I love Handke's prose and unpredictable movement. Loved the dissolution at the end into a string of memories, observations, quotations, statements as in The Weight of the World (an all-time favorite). He mentions going slowly so he doesn't lose his balance and maybe that's what I love about the prose and approach -- it tightropes across a crack in the cement, with the sense that if he missteps what seems solid beneath his feet will give out and reveal itself as a long way down through empty air. Like growing up after WWII in Austria, his mother's slow dissolution and suicide is internalized, it's something that he is, his being, an inheritance that doesn't express itself as a hyberbolic lie. Also great stuff early on about poverty, National Socialism, penny-pinching, restraint, true love, the walls closing in a little by little, more and more, over time. All of which might sound like dire reading, but it's really an \"enjoyable\" quick read. \"Someday I shall write about all this in greater detail.\""}, {"userName": "\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7260680", "userReview": "\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0623\u062f\u0628\u064a \u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u060c \u0647\u0627\u062f\u0626\u060c \u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0645\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u062d\u0627\u062f\u062b\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u062d\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0639\u0634\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u062a\u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u062a \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u062d\u064a\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629.\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0623\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0628\u0633\u064a\u0637\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0623\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0628\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0639\u0645\u064a\u0642\u0629.\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b.. \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0623\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0644\u0641\u060c \u0648\u0633\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0628\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629.\u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629"}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "Peter Handke has written an elegy for his mother, a suicide, unlike anything I've read before. It is also the story of many women born in Austria between the World Wars, when life was not only difficult, it was hard, even more so for women than men. Opportunities were few, happinesses meager. Escape taken if possible but then came the Nazi era, the post-War years, varying levels of hardship, marriage, family, no aspirations.He talks of the family and community into which she was born.For a woman to be born into such surroundings was in  itself deadly.

This is  true of every literary effort, but especially in this case, where the facts are so overwhelming that there is hardly anything to think out. ...I then adopted a new approach--starting not with facts but with the already available formulations, the linguistic deposit of man's social experience. ...... And because I cannot fully capture her in any sentence, I keep having to start from scratch and never arrive at the usual sharp and clear bird's-eye view. (loc 305)And then he continues to have difficulty:She refuses to be isolated and remains unfathomable; my sentences crash in the darkness and lie scattered on the paper.

It is about moments when the mind boggles with horror\u2026\u201dHow to explain the agonizing disintegration of a life? The gradual decay of whatever we humans possess that gives us a conscience? The notion of being?Handke\u2019s memoir on the suicide of his mother is not what you expect.Dismiss all idea of long-winded paragraphs recreating the suffocation of being a faceless, nameless woman drowned in squalid poverty and trapped in a bestial marriage between the World Wars.You won\u2019t find self-indulgence, an attempt at pseudo-psychology or a feast of melancholy embellished by overwrought prose. This is a brutally honest account on the experience of losing someone Handke was not necessarily close to, somebody he quite never understood, but somebody he loved all the same and never fully acknowledged as he thought she deserved.An account built upon stacked words that are shot like merciless weapons. Words that fall short. Words that fail enormously to pin down the fear, the sorrow, the dreams that created a mirage of illusion. Terror delivered in ruthless brackets, with scarcity of expression, like bombs falling when one is least prepared for them.Emotion is conspicuous by its absence, and only a succession of almost aseptic facts, reminiscent of Elfriede Jelinek or \u00c1gota Krist\u00f3f\u2019s detached brutality, pile up in impersonal recollection of a life stripped of its zest, a life that was stillborn, muted by sociopolitical context, which, at the same time, is neither excuse nor exoneration.If read in one sitting, as I recommend you do, you will notice that Handke\u2019s deliberate composition suffers a severe, shocking transformation when it\u2019s about to culminate. It evolves from a meticulously depersonalized chronicle into an intimate confession by a writer who is compelled to record his mother\u2019s life without using narrative devices because he doesn\u2019t want to write \u201ca story\u201d, he is desperate to tell the truth, his truth, what he thinks was his mother\u2019s truth, and in doing so, he collides against his own memories \u2013or \u201canecdotes\u201d as he calls them-, which crumble down along with his fragile words, leaving a sense of helplessness so vast and so deep that the inexpressible becomes a too tangible and unbearable reality that it gets excruciatingly painful to read.Horror can be described after all, something not even Handke thought possible when he started to write this book.\u201cHorror is something perfectly natural: the mind\u2019s emptiness. A thought is taking shape, then suddenly it notices that there is nothing more to think.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Billy O'Callaghan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4181062-billy-o-callaghan", "userReview": "This short work opens with a kick to the stomach, the clean, brutal newspaper announcement of the death, by suicide, of Handke's mother. Such tragedy though, we soon learn, isn't something limited merely to the moment. In an attempt to make sense of this ending (or a beginning), and to come to terms with the act itself, the author paints an astonishing words-and-ideas portrait of her life from youth through to death. It makes for harrowing but compelling reading and in the process also gives us a better understanding of the Austrian/German underclass existence, and a sense of the society that so opened its heart to the 1930s tidal wave of Nazism.We see an essentially happy girl who buys into the wartime fervour and who embraces the opportunity to escape the confines of her own small world in search of adventure. But after falling in love with a married man and falling pregnant with Peter, she accepts the marriage proposal of another soldier, one who she not only doesn't love but who repulses her. Once the war passes and she has settled down, life becomes almost unbearable. Her husband drinks too much and beats and bullies her. She administers her own abortions, with a knitting needle (the casual statement, reduced to mere fact, being one of the more stunning moments in the book), delivers and raises those pregnancies that can't be terminated, and settles into a poverty so immense, and so truthfully depicted that it brings a deeper understanding to the word. Then, as middle-age dawns, illnesses, mental breakdowns.If it sounds grim, it is. But this is not the point. Handke writes beautifully, collating memories, understanding their limitations. There is no hero worship, no excuses or attempts at justification, but neither is there blame. What survives are facts and tiny diamond-bright recollections, which help to make up the sense of a life lived. And there is an examination too of his own response to the news, initially upon hearing it that he should be \u201cbeside himself with pride\u201d but more considered once he finds himself alone with the corpse while time spins silently out.Peter Handke is one of the most controversial and provocative writers at work today (his Serb-friendly comments in particular on the Yugoslav wars have likely put him out of the running for an otherwise-deserved Nobel Prize) but also one of the most important. Certainly, in A Sorrow Beyond Dreams, as in all of his best work, he is fearless in addressing big issues, exposing and considering the madness that lurks just beneath the surface of the everyday and burrowing to the core of what constitutes a worthwhile existence."}, {"userName": "S.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/612774-s", "userReview": "NYRB not only has an amazing selection of books, but their cover design is invariably gorgeous, and in a few cases even seems reason enough to buy some of their titles. I loved the cover of Stoner and The Pilgrim Hawk: A Love Story and Novels in Three Lines, but the stark beauty of \"A Sorrow Beyond Dreams\" so far tops them all. The book is a memoir of another sad little round of life, and the cover, a photograph by James Casebere called \"A Barrel Vaulted Room,\" is a good match for it. I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t appreciate the photo fully in an online \u201creproduction\u201d but the tone is a chalky greenish grey, cool and institutionally atmospheric. It\u2019s bare, monochromatic and somehow sumptuous in its austerity. Even the cot may be made of stone. It looks more like a painting than a photograph, not least because of its simplicity. And weirdly enough, the photograph looks even better with the black NYRB title square plunk in the middle, pulling the shadows in the photograph to the foreground. A Sorrow Beyond Dreams itself is a memoir of Peter Handke\u2019s mother, which he wrote after she killed herself at the age of 51. For me, what the cover does in relation to the story is emphasize the solitude and loneliness each of us lives with, and inside of, and how permanent it is. The book has been praised to the heavens and it deserves to be.

It\u2019s a hybrid form \u2013 not quite memoir, but not exactly fiction either \u2013 about the life and suicide of his mother, written in the months immediately following her death. Handke struggles with whether or not it\u2019s possible to fully comprehend and articulate her experience, given the depth of feelings this event triggered in him.

Instead, he relates his worry about possible \"abstractions and formulations\" he is making while writing about her, the danger of them \"becoming independent\" which he fears would make his readers forget about her, \"painlessly submerging her in poetic sentences.\"It felt like he wanted to exhume his mother and put her on public display."}, {"userName": "Mustafa \u015eahin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7097719-mustafa-ahin", "userReview": "\u0130ntihar\u0131n\u0131n ard\u0131ndan annesine dair an\u0131lar\u0131n\u0131 derlemi\u015f Handke. \u0130nsan\u0131 bo\u011fan ve mutsuz eden bir kitap o y\u00fczden, ne yaz\u0131k ki. \u0130nsanl\u0131\u011f\u0131n en b\u00fcy\u00fck sorunu ilgisizlik olabilir mi acaba ger\u00e7ekten diye d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnmeden edemedim okurken. \u00c7ok g\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc c\u00fcmlelerle \u00f6r\u00fcl\u00fc bir kitap.\nArkada\u015fl\u0131k, b\u00fcy\u00fck oranda hesaba ve \u00e7\u0131kara indirgenmi\u015f bu ya\u015fam bi\u00e7iminde birbirini yak\u0131ndan tan\u0131mak, ama birbirine yak\u0131nla\u015f\u0131p i\u00e7ini a\u00e7mamak demekti.

There is in this book, of course, the outlines of his mother's story, which he narrates in a form that to my mind suggests a writer's journal. And he says as much: \"Someday I shall write about all this in greater detail.\" (p. 76) But the very nature of his narrative also evokes in me a sense of the life stories of many other individuals that he does not narrate - directly, but that are unmistakably present in subtexts.Above all, there is PH, himself, and my response to him lies in the host of questions that his writing raises in my mind. How is such a memoir at all possible? How did PH become the writer who could write a book of this kind?At this moment, it seems to me that only a writer who is capable of temporary self-erasure, momentary obliteration of self, of inhabiting the mind and body of his character could write a memoir that exhibits the power of \"A Sorrow Beyond Dreams\". And again, he says as much himself in an aside: \"I am able to capture my mother's story ... because ... her feelings become so palpable that I experience them as doubles and am identical with them.\" (p. 34) Then there are these self-revealing sentences that appear among the last pages of his book: \"Even now I sometimes wake up with a start, as though in response to some inward prodding, and, breathless with horror, feel that I am literally rotting away from second to second. The air in the darkness is so still that, losing their balance, torn from their moorings, the things of my world fly soundlessly about. In another minute they will come crashing down from all direction and smother me.\" (pp. 71-2) My reading is that in moments such as he describes in this passage PH has projected himself into his mother's corpse, which lies in its coffin, buried sans vault, while the coffin itself decomposes in the earth until it can no longer support the weight of the soil that bears down upon it. But then there are moments during which he evicts his mother from the mental and emotional space that he has allowed her to occupy, moments such as those he describes on pp. 31-4 as he scribbles post-modernist stuff regarding the fiction that inheres in all narrative, etc., etc., etc. And his mastery of language and form also evinces literary and critical capacities that shore up, buttress, perhaps constitute his defense of self, that brings him back to himself.So what sort of person could compose such a splendid narrative? As far as I can tell: that rare individual who can literally leave his body, imagine himself into the body and mind of his character, take possession of that body and mind, experience the world and himself/herself as his character experienced it, and in the very same moment observe himself, observe his experience in the body and mind of his character and commit his observations to paper in perfectly splendid language and form. And this is precisely the attribute of a writer that draws me again and again to literary biography in the hope of spending time in the company of such remarkable individuals, wondering all the while, exactly how and under what conditions these persons developed \"an inviolable private sphere\" (Barish), an imaginative, inner life, in which the events that \"A Sorrow\" documents are possible.I really must read this book in German."}, {"userName": "Mounir", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/348979-mounir", "userReview": "\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0644\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632\u0623\u0631\u062c\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0639 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a\u0631 \u0647\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0643\u0647"}, {"userName": "Hameed Younis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18612737-hameed-younis", "userReview": "\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629\u060c \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0637\u0627\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0632\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0648\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0633. \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0634\u062f\u0651 \u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0641 \u0648\u0642\u062f \u0635\u0642\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0643\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0634\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0639\u0637\u064a\u062a \u0644\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0629 \u0646\u062c\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0642\u0637\u060c \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0627\u0646\u0646\u064a \u0648\u062c\u062f\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0643\u062a\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0631\u0635\u0648\u0635\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0633\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0641\u064a\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0641\u0628\u0631\u0622\u064a\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0636\u0639 \u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u0628\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0641\u0638 \u0648\u0627\u0641\u0631\u063a \u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u0646\u0641 \u0648\u0647\u064a\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u0641\u0642\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u0635\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633\u0643\u0647."}, {"userName": "Argos", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16156347-argos", "userReview": "60 sayfal\u0131k bir anlat\u0131. \u0130ntihar eden annesinin ard\u0131ndan yazd\u0131\u011f\u0131 duygular. \u00c7eviri k\u00f6t\u00fc, zorlamal\u0131.

And yet it wasn't bad. The writing was not engaging enough, the biographical style he chose (\"after that, she did this...\" etc.) is hard to stomach for too long. You can tell that Handke was conscious of this too, putting in things that broke from the pattern, even a whole page meta-talking about why he decided to write it in this boring style! The book fails in some interesting ways. I feel like Handke never had a good sense of what he wanted to do with the subject matter. As for the story itself, it was okay; I was especially struck by some of the insights about about her mother growing up towards the beginning. I also admire his sincerity."}, {"userName": "Hans Castorp", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8191987-hans-castorp", "userReview": "Handke escribe desde el dolor m\u00e1s profundo sobre la madre; su vida, su muerte.

Not quite sure but after this one, I'm switching gears. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic book but it's fantastic in that gut-wrenching, can't-believe-people-lived-their-lives-with-this-much-pain-and-sorrow way.Peter Handke tells the life story of his mother who grew up in Austria, came of age in Germany between the Great War and World War II, and committed suicide in her early fifties.In the beginning he uses a child's game to illustrate his own mother's prospects in life: \"The girls in our town used to play a game based on the stations in a woman's life: Tired/Exhausted/Sick/Dying/Dead.\" (p. 12) His mother fights the tide of tradition- going to the big city, learning a trade (cooking), falling in love. But a pregnancy with her married lover result in her sidelining any hopes for herself, marrying a German soldier, and falling back into the drudgery she thought she'd escaped. As the eldest child, Handke witnesses firsthand his mother's transformation from hopeful youth to down-trodden mother of four.Despite the story's intimate nature, Handke keeps the language distant from his mother. He never tells the reader her name which lends it a kind of Everywoman feel. The story, even with a sensational act like suicide, ends not with the grand legacy of traditional biography but with a silent slip into obscurity. Yeah, depressing. Reading this is like a watching an animal try to escape a cage: first it's methodical, trying bars and latches, cracks and crevices, then, as it realizes the futility, it gets more frantic and chaotic until all that's left is an exhausted creature, resigned to a life forced by circumstance.Ralph Manheim's translation kept the lyrical quality of Handke's phrasing and it really makes for beautiful (if tragic) reading.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the culture of women, women\u2019s issues, or Austrian literature."}, {"userName": "Turki", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10289765-turki", "userReview": "\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639\u0629, \u0648\u0645\u0624\u062b\u0651\u0631\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u064b\u0627, \u0637\u0639\u0651\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0644\u0641 \u0628\u0625\u0642\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0633\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062a\u0647, \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0628\u0628\u0633\u0627\u0637\u062a\u0647\u0627, \u0648\u0628\u0644\u063a\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642\u0629, \u0648\u062d\u0632\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0642, \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0637\u0639 \u0639\u0627\u0637\u0641\u064a\u0629\u064b \u0648\u062a\u0623\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629\u0650 \u0644\u064a, \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0642\u0631\u0623\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u062a\u0623\u062b\u0651\u0631 \u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f, \u0648\u0643\u0646\u062a\u064f \u0623\u064f\u0637\u064a\u0644 \u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644\u0647\u0627, \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0647\u0632\u0651\u0646\u064a \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627, \u0648\u062a\u0624\u062b\u0651\u0631 \u0641\u064a\u0651, \u0623\u064a\u0651\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0623\u062b\u064a\u0631!

It is the most moving and accessible work in his distinguished career; it is \"indispensable\" (Bill Marx, The Boston Globe).", "title": "A Sorrow Beyond Dreams: A Life Story", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13539067-a-sorrow-beyond-dreams", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344321460l/13539067.jpg", "reviews": 147, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/965.Peter_Handke", "name": "Peter Handke"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1467.Jeffrey_Eugenides", "name": "Jeffrey Eugenides"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38449.Ralph_Manheim", "name": "Ralph Manheim"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "European Literature", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13539067-a-sorrow-beyond-dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24482.A_Sorrow_Beyond_Dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/997937.Wunschloses_Ungl_ck", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11545630", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17905947", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18463894-mutsuzlu-a-doyum", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/486188.A_Sorrow_Beyond_Dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30231175", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22231732-desgracia-impeorable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1444718.The_Goalie_s_Anxiety_at_the_Penalty_Kick", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1131696.The_Left_Handed_Woman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3338907-short-letter-long-farewell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/190829.Kaspar_and_Other_Plays", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1348459.The_Afternoon_of_a_Writer"]}
