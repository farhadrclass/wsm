His reasons for both = love for the heroine and the fact that he thinks he doesn't deserve her. Its a similar premise to Kleypas' novel - gypsy hero who is beneath the heroine, socially and is secretly uberly in love with her. And surprisingly, the heroines were scarily similar in that they were both so protected and sheltered by everybody and wanted to be free of that.I love Sylvia Day's writing but the hero does not endear me in any way. Sure he 'sacrificed' his life to become richer and be the man he thinks the heroine would want, but in turn, he pretended for years that he was dead leaving everyone who cared about him to grieve horribly. And have I mentioned that he actually reasoned his lust for other women (and his use of them) as a way to gain expertise to satisfy the heroine? Puh-leeze, man up and speak the truth.I think why I find these type of novels so irritating and throw-to-the-wall worthy is that there is no real power balance between the hero and heroine. The women are always so chaste and suppressed. I don't like the idea that if the hero were to die (for real) she would just stop living. In fact, she did stop living when she believed he was dead and I understand that some would think this so romantic and that it would symbolize how greatly she loved. On the other hand, I think a love like that is too destructive; its not positive. I would much rather prefer that the heroine appreciated that life she had, and be changed by it, but not so until she cannot live at all. Or maybe, the hero in this story was just not worth mourning for a whole lifetime... his rival was a whole lot sexier in my mind."}, {"userName": "Pepa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27256639-pepa", "userReview": "Estuvo bien, pero todo me pareci\u00f3 un sin sentido, sobre todo el personaje de ella.Si algo no soporto es que, dentro de lo que cabe, la historia no fluya con naturalidad y Amelia est\u00e1 fuera en todos los sentidos.

This story had a nice blend of intrigue and love!This is the 3rd book in this series but are written so they can be read as standalones.Loved the story of this couple! Amelia was sheltered and taken away from her sister, used as a pawn so her father can manipulate her older sister to doing his bidding...mainly for money. As her older sister dedicates her life to look for her, Amelia has been moved around and \"protected\" all her life. Nothing and no one is constant...except for the stable boy who becomes her best friend...her only friend. They love each other as only two who's been there for each other since childhood can. As they get older, Colin knows his love for Amelia is impossible. He's her servant and she's the daughter of a titled Lord. One fateful night, he risks his life to save her from abduction and is shot in the process. He was left for dead. Amelia, though rescued because of Colin, and reunited with her sister, mourns the loss of Colin - her one true love. It's a love that spans years and one that she's never been able to find again. Well Colin was shot but not quite dead. He defies his lowly station in life and becomes someone else, someone more, someone who is worthy of Amelia. Someone who can provide for her and give her what she deserves and can readily have with someone else. After years of obtaining wealth and a new identity, he seeks her out during a masquerade ball. She's instantly aware and drawn to the mask man. Her allure to the mystery stranger is undeniable and unexplainable. Her pursuit of Colin is rash but passionate. She puts aside a life of comfort and wealth for the stranger that has managed to make her feel passion for the first time since Colin. Oh how I waited anxiously for the reveal to happen! He loves her and she has always loved him! I just kept trying to read quickly so I can get to the reunion! It didn't quite go as beautifully as I wanted. She was more mad than joyful...at first! She feels as if she suffered those many years missing and pining for him thinking he was gone forever. His reasons took some convincing. And the convincing was sweet. It pulled some butterflies even. Sorry that this review is a bit elementary. I don't usually go into so much plot detail but the plot was the draw of this book. I love the lost love but found love story! Colin and Amelia's chemistry was tangible and sweet and hot! I couldn't read this book fast enough then was a bit sad when it was done.

I felt the plot was all over the place. I did not like how the first sex scene was about to take place but then ends and starts something else in the plot with other characters. Then it gets back to the sex scene. I do love good steamy scenes but the first one did drag on. The characters were all over the place. Ware who is Amelia fianc\u00e9 makes it very clear he does not want her interacting with Colin because it looks bad since they are to be wed and she needs to decide if she is going to be his wife then she needs to act like his fianc\u00e9 and not pursue Colin but all the while Ware is sleeping with someone else. Colin one minute his character is flat, and kind of cheesy but the next he a sexy dominate hero with a dirty talking mouth. I really wanted to like A Passion For Him. Love the idea of lost love. The synopsis grabbed my interest and even though it is the 3rd in the Georgian series I was not lost at all. Sylvia Day does a great job at letting the readers know what happened before but unfortunately it did not hold my interest enough and have no desire to read the pervious novels. I have yet to read The Crossfire series and heard great things about this series. I do look forward to trying that series out.

Colin did nothing for me and I really couldn\u2019t care less if he had stayed away from Amelia. In fact I like Ware much better than Colin.Amelia is just too much of a contradiction in how she is written. She is supposedly so chaste and innocent and protected but at times she is exactly opposite. She has mourned Colin for so many years and feels that she should marry Ware because they are such good friends and yet she goes and sleeps with Colin before she even knows who he really is.I think people will either like or dislike this book.

I love historical romance but lately all the books I came across were predictable. This was frustrating but A Passion For Him got me out of this slump. The lead pair was great and perfectly matched. Amelia was sweet and determined, Montoya was stubborn and resourceful. Amelia escaped from captivity but lost someone precious in the process. She is certain she will never love again till she runs into Montoya. This makes Amelia hope again but things are rarely that simple. Amelia discovers love and deception in the same place - Will she walk away or is his love enough to make her stay? I was bothered by the actions of the lead pair at times but could accept & understand their perspectives.

Amelia and Colin were characters I really enjoyed seeing in their respective heated chemistry, particularly in the beginning when Colin was the man behind the mask. There was a certain allure to that, and personally I had hoped that he'd reveal himself to her sooner than he did, but the prolongation of it somewhat bothered me, among other things. Still, there were moments I sincerely laughed out loud and I genuinely liked and got to know the cast of characters in this book, though sometimes in brief context. Hopefully I can explain this more in my full review.Full review:I might as well admit it: there were parts of this novel I really liked considering I love historical fiction and pieces where I can get to know the characters, laugh at their respective banter, and have a decent amount of allure and tension to carry through the story until its end. But there were also times I nearly snapped my pencil in two while reading this because of wanting to will the characters to go a different route altogether, not to mention some problem spots where it just didn't mesh right with me. When I started Day's \"A Passion for Him\" - note I had not read any of the other books in the series. Sylvia Day's still rather new to me as an author - I've read some of her novellas, I've read \"Bared to You\" - which I liked more than I thought I would going into it. I received the galley, but didn't realize it was a third book in a series. I figured I'd jump into it despite not having read the first two books. Then again, to enjoy this I didn't really feel like I needed to, it drew me in on the measure of the first chapter alone, and steamrolled quite a bit of the way into the narrative.Amelia meets an alluring masked stranger who calls himself Count Montoya. She's actually said to be wed to another man, but her heart still pines for the son of a Gypsy who lost his life trying to protect her. Lo and behold, said man (Colin) is not actually dead, but not only on the run from a crime he didn't commit, but also longing to reunite with his long lost love after being left for dead and recovering from that. And he's acting in the guise of the Count.There's really no denying the chemistry between Amelia and Count Montoya/Colin. I loved their interactions, found their humor charming in their respective companies, found quite a few scenes humorous and exciting to see. At first I thought maybe this would be your standard historical romance with humor and appropriate tensions, but then when the sexy times started happening - I knew this was definitely erotica, and of the steaming molten hot lava kind. In a way I'm glad that the erotic elements kind of came at a latter point in the story after the development, because it did make an appropriate payoff, but at the same time - I was bothered that Colin hadn't taken the time to say anything about his true identity before that point. I mean, yeah have your share of sexy times, but to wait to reveal yourself right after the night you had sex with the woman who hadn't been claimed by anyone else (sexually I mean)? And then to be in straight up denial of doing the wrong thing at first? No wonder Amelia wanted to smack your brains out and never wanted to see you again, dude. Seriously. She reacted the way I thought she would.The rest of the story unfolded rather nicely with attention to the reveal and how Colin and Amelia came to terms after that. I think the first part of the story was my favorite considering the humor, dialogue and play betweens, though I was glad to see some parts of development among other things towards the end. I have to give it to Sylvia Day, this book certainly kept my attention and didn't let go for a while. The narrative flows smoothly and actually ended up being a quicker read than I imagined. I do want to check into more of Day's work from here on out, and I did enjoy a good bit of this, despite some personal qualms.Overall, recommended.Overall score: 3.5/5Note: I received this as an ARC from NetGalley, from the publisher Kensington."}, {"userName": "Letitia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4952315-letitia", "userReview": "Rating: C ... Heat: HotI love Sylvia Day. She writes incomparable sex scenes that simply melt your insides. I love second chance romances. Watching two characters get another go at getting it right. I also love mistaken identities and masks and gently bred young ladies falling in love with rough gypsy boys. A Passion for Him is all of those things and yet... I felt no passion for this book. Amelia Benbridge has always loved the gypsy boy that works in her father\u2019s stables. That gypsy boy, Colin Mitchel, has also always loved Amelia but knows he can\u2019t have her. As with all forbidden loves, stolen moments and secret kisses follow. Unfortunately, because of some bad dealings her father made, men come in the middle of the night to kidnap Amelia. During her rescue by Colin, he is shot in the chest and Amelia believes that he died saving her life. Never knowing she loved him. Years and years pass. Amelia sees a masked man at ball and is drawn out into the night to meet him. And, with one kiss, becomes obsessed with the masked man. Colin, who only wanted to glimpse Amelia, soon finds that he is risking more and more to see her again and again. Because in the ensuing years, Colin has become a spy for England and is currently pursuing and being pursued by an agent gone rogue. A Passion for Him has a lot of elements I like in my romances. Strong-willed females characters, heroes who want to protect their ladies \u2013 even from themselves. It also has murder and mystery and intrigue. However, I never fell in love with Amelia and Colin. The majority of their romance happened off-screen when they were teens and, even though we see those years in a few flashbacks, it didn\u2019t translate to the present for me. I also didn\u2019t get Colin\u2019s continued use of the mask and delaying in telling Amelia the truth. And their first time together... it was hot, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it was also awkwardly broken up with changes to other characters POVs. Very strange execution.  While this may not join the ranks of my other favorite Sylvia Day novels, it was still a good book and I did enjoy it.

I must admit,I have read this one out of sequence in the series,but had no problems following the storyline. Follow, Amelia Benbridge,the Earl of Ware and Colin Mitchell on a journey of not only passion but also one of fear. \"A Passion For Him\" is filled with passion,desire,secrets,and danger. Fear,desire and passion is what drove Colin and Amelia apart all those years ago, and the need for Colin to be more than a Gypsy stable boy. He wanted to make something of himself before offering for Amelia's hand in marriage. But alas,that was not to be, for when Colin's death was reported, Amelia must continue with her young life,enter the Earl of Ware,but things change. A remarkable story of love once lost but found again. We all have a dark side,but with the right person one can find happiness and peace. Colin has a dark and deadly side,Amelia is his light in the darkness and his happiness. An intriguing story with a spy or two,danger,passion,a pirate, and a woman's young and forbidden love. Fast paced with love,passion,explicit sensual scenes,and danger. Another not to miss in this exciting \"Georgian\" series. I can hardly wait for another episode of the \"Georgian\" series,yes,#2 in this amazing,fast paced series. Again, Ms. Day has written a story that will pull the reader in and hold them there,with her engaging characters and intriguing plots. A must read and one I would highly recommend to any historical romance readers,erotic romance readers and the readers of Georgian England. While, \"A Passion For Him\" has explicit sensual scenes they are done tactfully and does not distract from the story,but adds to it.

I was hoping for something better. I was disappointed.I loved the two characters Colin and Amelia, introduced in the previous book Passion For The Game, as follows. Amelia was the daughter of a viscount. Colin was the gypsy stableboy. They met when she was around five years old and grew up together. They loved each other. Colin felt he could never provide for her properly because he was a servant. He saved Amelia from a kidnapping but he was shot in the process.A Passion For Him starts with the following. He survived the shot, but he never told Amelia or his uncle who raised him. Simon offered Colin a job as a secret agent in France, saying Colin could gain wealth and a title and then return to marry Amelia later. In my opinion, Colin should have told Amelia he would leave her for awhile to gain wealth and that he would return. Instead, he allowed her to believe he was dead. About eight years later he returned. Even though he is in a disguise, she is still drawn to him. They have sex. The next day, he tells her his name and that he has returned for her. I did not like the way that she got mad at him. She left him saying \u201cit will be farewell between us.\u201dA subplot involves Colin witnessing Cartland killing someone in France. Cartland told French officials that Colin did it. Cartland and French officials are searching for Colin in England.I\u2019m not sure what this story was missing.

Six years on and she's set to marry her best friend Lord Ware - however Colin is alive and well and has become a spy in order to make enough money to marry his beloved Amelia - having mistresses and adventures galore in the interim. Now he's back and still tries to avoid Amelia because his life's in danger and he has to catch the villain before he can consider settling down.Story is all over the place - the spy plot and the romance seem two very separate entities. It also brings in other characters from the other books in the series which becomes a tad distracting.I personally didn't like Colin the hero - yes he was hunky and brooding, but I just didn't like his actions.

Some of the scenes and emotions between Colin and Amelia tore me to pieces. This was truly a touching story. The love between them was very vivid and passionate. I pitied Colin when Amelia pushed him away, even when he tried to build a title, worth and everything he thought she deserved that he should be able to offer her - it was very emotional and heart-breaking. I felt bad for Amelia when she discovered that Count Montoya was not who he said he was though. I wish more had happened between them. Maybe more wooing, more laughter, more joy, more time together as a couple....etc. It was basically about the two of them being together and trying to piece it back together (but it's not like I mind). Aside from the romance, there wasn't enough to entice me; the other scenes were kind of boring except the parts with the hero and heroine. Overall, this book has depth and has a good storyline to carry it through. There are no inconsistencies and the romance is definitely a hooker.

It was a terrible book and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."}, {"userName": "Elle the ClosetRomanceReader aka Leftie aka Shoebelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14683446-elle-the-closetromancereader-aka-leftie-aka-shoebelle", "userReview": "I truly wish I can rate this book higher because I love Sylvia Day's writing and I'm a huge fan. This book is no different in a sense that you get the same quality of writing. But I cant get over the part where Amelia, in essence, did it with a \"stranger\", and how I felt that romanticized and totally downplayed the danger of such kinds of action. Granted the \"stranger\" was no stranger at all, it still didn't sit well with me, sorry."}, {"userName": "Nishtha", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17878332-nishtha", "userReview": "4.5 stars...A beautiful tale of love.

Both historically inaccurate as well as unbelievable. If you get shot in the chest these days you might have a better than evens chance of survival with medical attention, but in the Georgian time with no medical attention to speak of, not bloody likely. Ok, i'll sum this up neatly.

Although I started this series by reading the third book, I did not feel like I missed a beat. It was extremely easy to get to know the characters and delve into the story.
