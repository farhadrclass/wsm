The quality of the writing is lovely\u2014such pleasurable rolling phrases and paragraphs. Such ease and flow, such assured connectedness. All this is the mark of a mature novelist, writing in his prime. But what a task he has set himself here! The tale covers not only several plot lines and groups of characters, it tells the story of a whole country (Scotland) over five decades. In fact, Scotland herself may be the main character\u2014although I don\u2019t think she is exactly. I believe the main character is Jack, the man who goes missing on page 211 and who finally turns up again, in a photograph, on page 666.The novel opens with Michael Pendreich, a photographer trying to \u201cimpose a bit more order\u201d on the archive of his father\u2019s work. Angus Pendreich is the real artist\u2014the father with whom the son can never catch up. And in a way, he is also a missing character. We only pick up bits of his story from other characters who have known him. Angus, too, is a story-teller, but his story is visual. It is a photographic narrative of Scotland over fifty years\u2014or at least that\u2019s how his son Michael sees it. Meanwhile, the novel itself is James Robertson\u2019s attempt to \u201cimpose a bit more order\u201d on half a century of Scottish social and political history, pieced together through the lives of some of its people. Narrative within narrative, story within story.The reader, too, follows the various threads, creating a sense of what has \u2018really\u2019 been going on, having faith that the novelist will somehow assemble the plot pieces in the final analysis. Which he does. \u201cThings fall into place\u201d (which could also be the novel\u2019s subtitle). Or more or less. Michael\u2019s task, it appears, is to make \u201cthe connections, more of them than he can know or imagine\u201d. There is a kind of d\u00e9nouement in the concluding chapter, in which a number of things are made plain, and some things not.But the enduring power of this novel, it seems to me, is that one is left pondering the various elements: reviewing where the Stone of Destiny and Margaret Thatcher fitted in, \u2018seeing\u2019 the photograph of Mick McGahy as tragic hero, mentally inhabiting a time when the Ministry of War had only recently turned into the Ministry of Defence. I wept at the resolution of Michael Pendreich\u2019s own love story\u2014I admit it. Any novel worth its salt must make the reader tearful at some point. It is a tricky thing, though, to combine so many different characters and there was a point where I disengaged slightly. This may be because I am a slightly old-fashioned novel reader. I hanker to identify strongly with one of the situations or characters and in this case I was moved from one to another and I didn\u2019t care about them all equally, even when compelling things were happening to them. I wanted to get back to Michael Pendreich and the photographs and the difficulty of writing the introduction to his father\u2019s work. The novel returns to that, in the end, and the end is worth waiting for, but it takes time.On first reading, too, I was uneasy with some of the visual aspects of the book. One of the connecting threads is a set of meditations, each of which is an insight into the mind of Jack. These are among the most interesting parts of the whole work\u2014but italics are hard going, and the second-person singular (\u201cWhen you first set out there were still heavy horses pulling the ploughs but before long they were all but gone . . .\u201d) was such a strong evocation of Grassic Gibbon that it made me uneasy, although the style is also a necessary marker\u2014so strong that it outweighs the necessity for a different typeface. Besides we\u2019re soon into Michael\u2019s attempt to write a preface to his father\u2019s collected works (another new typeface), and then, mysteriously, in part three the page format changes from fully-justified to left-justified. These visual variations were, to me, a distraction.There is a risk, too, that the social and political background, meticulously etched in as a backdrop to the personal stories, is less appealing to some readers than others. The further away it gets, of course, the more you see it as a \u2018story\u2019, rather than just the recent past. Which brings me to the central idea, or what appears to be central, that we should \u201ctrust the story\u201d. It\u2019s an insight that comes to Michael (the man who makes the connections) while making a public speech about his father\u2019s work: \u201cWhatever else we put faith in will, in the end, betray us or we will betray it. But the story never betrays. It twists and turns and sometimes it takes you to terrible places and sometimes it gets lost or appears to abandon you, but if you look hard enough it is still there. It goes on. The story is the only thing we can really, truly know.\u201dThis is persuasive rhetoric, and it is also the experience of reading this novel. But is it true in absolute terms? I\u2019m not convinced we ever \u201ctruly know\u201d the story, although the ongoing narrative is what keeps the fascination, what holds the necessary sense of inner meaning, even when that meaning is too profound to put into words\u2014and too simple: it is a supply of pebbles, smoothed by the sea, passed from person to person, each tasted or discarded, or treasured in secret. These stones, these symbols, are part of Jack\u2019s story. They serve to remind us, like Jean Barbour\u2019s tales of Jack the adventurer, that James Robertson is also a poet.Jean Barbour, a character I wanted more of, occupies the role of story-teller several times, and she is the person who first comes out with the watchwords: \u201cTrust the story\u201d. Two of her \u2018folk\u2019 stories work their way into the novel. First, there\u2019s the cautionary tale of the young man who wanted to know what happened at the end of the story\u2014an object lesson in why one should have patience. Second, there\u2019s the story of one of Jack\u2019s adventures (as in bean stalk)\u2014the one where he goes to look over the edge of the world, leaving his own soul as security. These are wonderful pieces of narration, little fragments of the old tradition, gleaming like jewels in the novel at large. They tell a truth, and they tell it beautifully slant. Jean Barbour says she has \u201calways wanted to tell a story with no beginning, no middle and no end\u201d. And when pushed by Mike to explain what this story is\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s about us, all of us. It\u2019s the story we\u2019re in.\u201dAnd the Land Lay Still is the story James Robertson and his contemporary readers are in. It\u2019s the author\u2019s life story, although he doesn\u2019t appear in person. And yet he is in it, is he not? Isn\u2019t he omni-present, as well as a living witness to the social narrative? The novel is a powerful piece of work and a cracking (and at times, crackling) read. Its scope is immense, its authorial control assured. Mingling truth and fiction, a time-honoured technique, makes the imaginative elements feel curiously true, especially if you were there, as it were. If you were not there, you could do worse than read this as an introduction to contemporary Scotland\u2014what made us as we are, what continues to shape our future. Many of the characters must be recognizable in other civilizations too: the idea of nationality as a continually changing concept is transferable to any people and any setting. Or you could just read it for the story.So what does happen at the end? We don\u2019t know yet, because the story hasn\u2019t ended, and if it had a beginning, it is too far back to remember. All we know is we are connected\u2014in one way or another, we make connections. Things fall into place, and we call that process a story. At least we do when those \u2018things\u2019 have fallen into the hands of a true artist, someone who captivates, entertains and controls, and still trusts the story, rather than his own version of events. Which describes James Robertson rather well."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara", "userReview": "This audiobook is over 33 hours, and yet I never considered giving it up. In the beginning, it wasn't easy keeping track of the cast of characters, but I got to know them. This is a portrait of Scotland of the last 5 to 6 decades. This was a politically tumultuous time. Devolution, Thatcherism, the crushing of the miners (the first miners' strikes were in Scotland), Scottish Nationalism, and much more. It is probably helpful if readers have some notion of what these issues are/were, and a general outline of Scottish politics. The political intrigue was the best part of this epic novel, and considering the stories of MacBeth and Mary Queen of Scots, it is clear that Scottish intrigue rivals and sometimes may even top that of the English.It took me a long time to get through this book because I have not been commuting regularly this month. Between bad weather, and a bought of bronchitis, I haven't had as much time to listen. However, I had no problem picking it up after a break. Highly recommended for those who are interested in contemporary Scotland, the politics and the people, and going way beyond the misty romantic stories with which outsiders stuff their heads."}, {"userName": "Duncan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875688-duncan", "userReview": "To be honest I gave up on this book about half way through. I have lived in the times described and found the depiction of real characters and real events somewhat disturbing. I went to school with a close relative of the man who actually found the Stone of Destiny in Arbroath Abbey, for example. When I resumed, I hit the narrative and found a solid flow which I read and read and read. A sleepless night allowed me to make progress and find how some of the characters developed and were brought together. I particularly enjoyed the interplay of Scottish politics, not rubbished, but central to the theme. I recall mention of some of the shadowy figures and I personally recall hearing another speak.Am I alone in wanting more? Where are the pictures? I enjoyed mention of the disruption and the setting up of the free church, I too have a copy of the painting discussed. Now I have finished, I am likely to start this book and on re-reading it will enjoy almost every page."}, {"userName": "Lari Don", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7443049-lari-don", "userReview": "This is the only book I've ever read which felt like a faithful and sympathetic portrait of the Scotland I live in and grew up in. It covers a huge swathe of Scotland's history and geography, and it does so from a fairly clear political point of view. I loved it. I recommend it to everyone. It's long. It's not light and fluffy. It's probably not for die-hard fans of Thatcherism, unless they are prepared to read other points of view. But it is an incredibly successful attempt to bring the vital social, economic and political changes in Scotland in the last 60 years to life with memorable and believable characters."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23727744-kate", "userReview": "This is epic. And so relevant, reminding us that what this generation believe to be new political thinking actually is not. Not in the slightest.This is a generational novel, primarily set in Scotland, spanning 60 years. It has a large cast of characters, whose individual stories all weave together. I personally love these types of narratives, but they can get confusing, remembering who is who, but Robertson doesn't let you get lost. I felt so safe with him. I knew that if I read on and trusted him, he would not let me down; and he didn't.I loved all the different styles of writing Robertson included. It keeps a fresh atmosphere. Often lengthy novels suffer from being too long; they reach a point where the story starts to drag and you feel the author doesn't know how to end. Unfortunately 'And the Land' does suffer from length problems, but not much. Yes it could be a tad shorter, but just a tad. But I never felt that Robertson had lost his way, and he didn't. I really liked the ending. The reader has to be in the right temperament to want to read about all the political stuff, of which there is a lot, but politics is a character in it's own right. Is it necessary? I'm still unsure. I loved it though, and was immersed in the story. There is just so much in this novel to think about. It is epic."}, {"userName": "Adrian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9649042-adrian", "userReview": "It\u2019s a sign of a good book that you continue to miss the characters after you\u2019ve finished the last chapter. And that you're sad its all ended, even after the 650th page has been turned.The Land Lay Still is a sweeping history of post war Scotland that educates, excites and agitates; the peaks and troughs of the independence movement as seen through the eyes of photographers, journalists, spies, the young, the old, the innocent and the criminal. This is a book of personal stories that fit into a wider narrative of opportunities lost, both for the individuals concerned and Scotland as a whole. A fascinating and well researched overview of the key political moments for the country and the impact they have on a personal and historical level. Robertson can make you feel the impact of war, the cruelty of Thatcherism and at the same time almost feel sorry for a downfallen Tory. Amazingly well structured and thoroughly recommended."}, {"userName": "Lee Ann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6251627-lee-ann", "userReview": "I would have given this book 5 stars but the middle section let it down really badly.

And this is never a good thing. I first meet him, aged 53 shortly after his father's death as Mike sorts through his father's photographs for a retrospective exhibition for which he has been invited to curate and write the introduction to the catalog \u2013 a task which he is finding increasingly difficult. Here in remote northern Scotland, Mike is in his father's hideaway cottage on the Sutherland coast where he discovers a rare photograph of his parents and himself as a young boy. Mike remembers the strange circumstance when the photo was taken by a passing tramp who gave him a pebble. This sets off Mike's memories of the divorce of his parents and his miserable time at prep school where upper class Eddy was his only friend and how he came to love photography through his excursions with his father, often stolen from school time and the annual two weeks in Sutherland with him in the cottage. This story sets up the fascinating pattern of this very satisfying long novel which is held together by the interplay between the characters and their appearances in the photographs alongside the story of Mike discovering not only what his true profession might be but what he is and how he became that person.Another interplay is between the Scottish tradition of story-telling as Mike's self questioning and his memories of his father are set within the wider social story of the Scots political desire for independence. Central to these stories is the Edinburgh salon of one of his father's lovers, Jean Barbour who in her old age still lives in the run-down, difficult to find flat in an ancient building in a cul-desac just off the Royal Mile. Here at night, artists, performers, musicians and storytellers, old and young, the misfits, ravers and revolutionaries drop in to her open house and drink, talk and play through til dawn. Here are told many kinds of stories and like the boxes of the father's photographs are not in any order which is a situation that Jean enjoys, because she dislikes chronology: 'memories do not order themselves'. These stories widen the scope of the novel to include Scotland itself and the concept of being a Scot. I was enthralled to read of the theft of the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey and its return from its Scots hiding place in 1951 and the referendum of 1979 when devolution was rejected which led to the Labour party losing their traditional Scots seats and allowed the birth of the Thatcher government which was so destructive of Scots concepts of society, she having infamously declared that 'there is no such thing as society'. As I read the novel during the 2014 referendum on Scots independence, this conjunction of events gave me even more pleasure and deepened my responses to it.The seventies were indeed 'the decade when the world changed' as Mike says and reviewing his father's work leads Mike to find the change in himself that he did not take at the right time when the sexual revolution struck. 'Why are we all so closed up?' one character asks. The huge cast of characters from 1947 to 2008 includes the tramp who took Mike's only family photo and gave pebbles to other characters too, World War II servicemen untreated for the psychological wounds that lay invisibly within them, politicians, CND protesters and even, a MI5 spy whose story is the only one I could have done without. Like the photos, the novel put me as the reader right into the stories; Jean said 'Trust the story' to make sense of the past if you can trust the storyteller and James Robertson certainly won my trust. Photography has been called 'the gift of the moment' and Robertson understands and interprets these moments then goes far beyond them to create this great patch-work quilt of his novel.February 2015"}, {"userName": "Ian Young", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892498-ian-young", "userReview": "A huge, sweeping soap-opera of a novel set against the background of the Scottish Nationalist movement.

The range of experiences of the characters is carefully chosen to give different perspectives on political and cultural changes. A gay photographer, an ex-spy, a feminist journalist, a working class man in a small mining town and Tory MP: their lives connect directly and indirectly, sometimes in surprising ways and sometimes with an inevitability that drives the story on.The novel is very much about connections between people, and it is punctuated by points at which these multiple narratives click together satisfyingly. Characters who have been mentioned in passing are later picked up and unraveled to reveal complex lives and personalities. We get to see what was going on in their minds when they flitted insignificantly through someone else\u2019s life.My favourite storyline follows a vagabond wandering back and forth through the Scottish countryside, battling with his daemons and finding peace in nature. His character and story are built up through small moments and incidents.Some of the storylines were less fully realised. Dramatic and life-changing things happen to the journalist, but they narrative seemed to rush through them.I feel like I learned a lot from this book. There are pages at a time about the ins and outs of Scottish nationalism, the rises and falls of political parties and the tensions among factions. This interesting, although sometimes a bit cumbersome. What i found really eye-opening though was the wonderfully vivid depiction of Scotttish small town life in the 50s.

She enjoyed the political history woven into the narrative, most of which was new to her, as Scottish news wasn't generally reported in Wales where she was brought up. She also loved the weaving together of so many disparate characters' stories, and she felt the author evocatively described the Scottish landscape. So I approached the book with a certain anticipation, but overall was sadly disappointed.I did enjoy being reminded of the context of a lot of the events described, though the author seems to have included reams of unnecessary detail that added nothing to the story but thousands of words. Perhaps he just didn't want all that precious research to go to waste, but it smacks of sloppy editing.As has been noted by others, the author set out to portray a sweeping panorama of Scottish lives, society and politics. There was a certain voyeuristic satisfaction in their observation. The intersecting of characters' paths was intricate and carefully crafted, if somewhat contrived. However, that seems to have been the limit of the author's plotting. Maybe I just missed it, but I thought the story lacked any overall objective and meandered as aimlessly as its characters.

Firstly I learnt loads about Scottish history which was brilliant.Secondly some parts of this novel are really good and absorbing.However I found the middle section a complete trudge that did little to add to the overall story and after a while the nationalist narrative wears a bit thin....This novel made a lovely backdrop to my recent holiday to Scotland and I am glad I picked it up but it\u2019s a bit of a chore at times."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/348966-mark", "userReview": "A masterpiece. All the more so for its ambitious scope yet tight plotting, thematic coherence, three-dimensional characters. Spanning sixty years or so, the novel dramatizes the changing political and cultural climate of Scotland through the perspectives of several families and interlinked protagonists. The opening section is about a son's struggle to deal with his talented deadbeat dad's legacy: Michael Pendreich emulates his father by working hard at achieving something like the level of fame and respect for his photography that father Angus accomplished without ever seeming to try. A philanderer who left his wife when Michael was a wee boy, Angus always managed to capture the essence of any scene he pointed his lens at, but always denied that photography is even an art. In the present moment of the novel, Michael is putting together a big retrospective exhibition of Angus's work and agonizing over the introduction he is supposed to write for the companion book. This means confronting his own failures as well as his dad's great success, reliving as he does his entire life. Inserted into this framing narrative are huge sections focusing on other characters. I won't detail them all, but my favorites are Peter Bond and Jack Gordon. Jimmy Bond, as he starts out, is an idealistic young working-class Scot who hopes to advance in the British government in London but is pushed into working as a third-rate spy back in Scotland trying to infiltrate his own countryfolk's labor union and nationalist activities. He is \"the real James Bond\" but has to use his middle name, Peter, to avoid ridicule. Jack Gordon comes back from a Japanese POW camp married (to an English woman) but haunted and decides he can only live by walking the roads of Scotland alone as a homeless tramp. I'll add one more: Jean Barbour. If there's one weakness in this great novel it's the absence of sympathetic female characters (in my opinion) -- with the exception of Jean. An old flame of Angus Pendreich's, she becomes Mike's friend and muse, as she does with a revolving Bohemian group of young Scots. Her ancient flat in the Old Town of Edinburgh is the center for poets, singers, artists, and revolutionaries, and Jean herself is the presiding sorceress who conjures with stories. In one gathering, she begins this way: \"There are good listeners and there are those that are not so good at listening,\" Jean said. \"If you know what you're doing, if the story you're telling is good enough, you can hook them all, some more securely than others but you can hook each and every one of them. But sometimes you get the awkward buggers, the fykie folk that can't sit still at all, they fidget away and pick their nebs and shift their bums from side to side, they're bored or they want to be the centre of attention--something I deplore, of course--\" she said with a sly look, \"or maybe they can't help themselves, they just want to know the end of the story long before you've got to it.\"If you're that kind of listener or reader, don't try to read And the Land Lay Still. It's maybe longer than War and Peace. But it rewards with every page. Jean Barbour continues after her preamble, or warning, with the story of one such impatient listener who wants to leave for some reason but can't find the exit. Jean tells him he can find out the ending of the story by asking her elderly Aunt (because it's a traditional tale passed from generation to generation, of course) who's off in another room. But Aunt Greta sends him to another, older, relative, and in every room he goes into, the ancestors get more and more decrepit and each asks him to explain what he's doing and why, beginning at the beginning, until he finds himself trapped in an infinite regression to the beginning of time. And he still does not learn the outcome of the original story. \"And, do you know, Jean said, that young laddie has never shown his face in this house again.\""}, {"userName": "Pauline Ross", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3321575-pauline-ross", "userReview": "This is a meandering tale that weaves together numerous strands of personal stories with the last fifty years of Scottish history, both political and social. The first character we meet, Mike, is a photographer and the son of a famous (and rather better) photographer, and his story I found interesting. He\u2019s a fairly passive person, almost seeming to be an outsider in his own life sometimes, and surprisingly mature in his early years. When he discovers that he is gay, there is none of the angst or shock or even horror that might be expected in the early seventies. He simply accepts it, and expects everyone else to accept it too. The minor characters pop up at significant moments is his life, or to underscore the political events of the day, and therefore feel fairly contrived. Jean, in particular, seems almost unreal, a semi-mystical figure acting as a catalyst both for Mike\u2019s personal life (such as introducing him to a boyfriend) and also in the political spectrum, the focus for debate. Everyone seemed to gather around Jean, and her legendary, almost mythical, stories.The second character, Don, is a Mr Everyman, a survivor of the war living a quiet life with his wife, whose sole purpose seems to be to illuminate aspects of the life of Jack, an odd character who survived the Japanese prisoner of war camps physically intact but mentally scarred.Then we get to Peter (also Jimmy) Bond, Jack's nephew, recruited into the intelligence service to (essentially) spy on the nationalists. Peter is more interesting, perhaps, because we see him at a point in his life where neglectful alcoholism is catching up with him, and he's only barely connected with reality. But there's a macabre humour to it - when he starts having hallucinations, he's relieved to realise that one of them must be a ghost, and therefore there's no need to politely offer a drink.Then it\u2019s on to Ellen, growing up in a mining village in the fifties. Every time we switch character, I lose heart. This book is long, it\u2019s largely about politics which to be fair has some interest, but not at this length, and frankly it\u2019s unfocused and rambling. Any one part of the book, telling the story of one character in depth, would have made a good book and illuminated a shadowy part of recent history, but trying to do too much makes it feel as though it ought to be a textbook, not a work of fiction. I struggled on, as the story threads became more and more intertwined, or perhaps tangled is a better word for it. All these many characters are somehow mixed up together, in a way that only grandiose fiction can get away with.This is not a bad book. Rather, it\u2019s over-ambitious, and it commits the cardinal sin of an author who\u2019s done a great deal of meticulous research - he wants to get every last bit of it into the book, every major political event, every well-loved TV program or film, every disaster, every social change. It almost felt as if he had a checklist and was ticking off events. There are at least half a dozen terrific stories in here if the author could have brought his eyes down from the stars and focused instead on just a few of these characters at a time. That way, they would have become memorable, fully-rounded people instead of mere ciphers, stand-ins for this or that aspect of the changing face of Scotland. This is non-fiction with a thin veneer of rambling storytelling. And yes, I get the point about the story never ending, trust the story and all that. Still it would have been nice to feel there actually was a proper, novel-sized story in here, something with a beginning, a middle and an end, rather than a series of vignettes. On the plus side, it\u2019s well written and there\u2019s some interesting detail about the Scottish political scene which I enjoyed learning about. So three stars for effort."}, {"userName": "Truusje", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16228416-truusje", "userReview": "A complex book with lots of different characters whose stories are beautifully intertwined.It took 100 pages or so to get into the story, I found it hard to let it go."}, {"userName": "Eddie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16734700-eddie", "userReview": "And the Land Lay Still was published in 2010 and its subject, Scotland's identity, is highly topical at the moment. There are a couple of articles that I would recommend reading in conjunction with this book. The firts is by Irving Welsh, a Scottish novelist, http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/... and the second is by Kevin McKenna, a Scottish journalist http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfr.... Welsh makes a strong case for independence and McKenna thinks that events in England could be inadvertently forcing Scotland towards independence.In 1979 Scotland faced a vote for independence. The SNP were trailing behind labour and the conservatives in Scotland. An amendment to the bill stated that for independence they needed over 40% of the total population to vote for it 51.6 voted for it out of a turnout of 63.8% of the electorate.Robertson has finished a massive project: to build a picture of Scotland's history during the last 30 or so years from the prospective a of broad section of society. Through characters like Don Lemmy and Jack Gordon, who both meet for a pint every week we learn about Scottish views on socialism and nationalism. For these two how their experience of war (2nd World War) has shaped their particular views on society. In fact Jack Gordon goes missing and his disjointed thoughts run through the book out-with the main dialogue. This adds mystery to the story and reflecting partly how the reader might be trying to piece together the disparate parts of Scotland's narrative.Much of the book is set in fictional places between and around Glasgow and Edinburgh. I guess places in Falkirk, North Lanarkshire, West Lothian, South Lothian, East Lothian or Fife and some of the darker sides of life in these towns are explored. Don Lemmy's son slowly and subtly, before his father realises, becomes involved with gangs and criminality. Through his experiences we explore masculinity, ignorance and to some extent the lack of opportunities for some sections of these societies. There is a lot in this book and I intend to read it again to truly appreciate it."}, {"userName": "Ian Mapp", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1598886-ian-mapp", "userReview": "I'm sure that this will be my book of the year. Its huge, rambling and brilliantly combines the political with the personal.I am watching Our Friend in the North on DVD and there are certain parallels with this book, although ATTLLS is all about modern Scottish History.The book is framed by Michael Pendreich preparing an exhibition of his fathers work. The subjects of the photos provide the story.We have some great characters. The Pendriech's themselves, Jean who opens her house for parties at night, an ex WWII POW who turns away from his family and becomes a tramp and my favorite.... the alcholic Civil Servant who shares his name with 007.The structure of the book is tricky to keep up with but it is written in such a way that it works. The politics is never overbearing and relates to things that you can remember. The only criticism I would have of the book is that in the last 200 pages, recent political events were documented like an essay, rather than to the benefit of the book.And i didn't mind the co-incidences at the end of the book where some of the characters mets up at the exhibition and knew of each other. Every time I go to Scotland on business, one of the locals meets someone in a lift who he went to school with.In fact, that reminds me of when I was in Florida on business and two people at dinner were both from the west coast. After 30 minutes of sharing acquaintences with each other there was a thoughtful pause in the conversation. This was broken when one of them asked \"Didn't I sleep with your sister?\".Scotland is just hat sort of place.I will be finding out more of Robertson's books after this.Book of the Year."}], "description": "Michael Pendreich is curating an exhibition of photographs by his late, celebrated father Angus for the National Gallery of Photography in Edinburgh. The show will cover fifty years of Scottish life but, as he arranges the images and writes his catalogue essay, what story is Michael really trying to tell: his father's, his own or that of Scotland itself? And what of the stories of the individuals captured by Angus Pendreich's lens over all those decades? The homeless wanderer collecting pebbles; the Second World War veteran and the Asian shopkeeper, fighting to make better lives for their families; the Conservative MP with a secret passion, and his drop-out sister, vengeful against class privilege; the alcoholic intelligence officer betrayed on all sides, not least by his own inadequacy; the activists fighting for Scottish Home Rule \u2013 all have their own tales to tell.
