Tata, published by St. Martin\u2019s Press.Category \u2013 Mystery/Thriller Publication Date \u2013 May 08, 2018.Who best to write a novel about a sniper than a sniper himself. Nicholas Irving was a Ranger and a sniper for his battalion. This is his third book, the first \u201cThe Reaper\u201d, and the second was \u201cWay of the Reaper\u201d.Vic Harwood is on assignment in Afghanistan with his spotter, Sammie Samuelson. They are hit by a mortar round and Vic is rescued but there is no sign of Sammie or Vic\u2019s rifle.While mending and doing sniper assignments in the United States Vic becomes involved with Jackie Colt who is an Olympic medalist in shooting. Vic finds himself \u201con the run\u201d as high ranking Army Officers and CEO\u2019s are being murdered by a sniper. Suspicion is on Vic but he believes the sniper may be an old adversary from Afghanistan, Khasan Basayev.In putting the pieces together, Vic starts to realize that the murders may have to do with drug and human trafficking that could have the Army and an Army contractor involved.This is not only a sniper novel, but one filled with mystery and action. A book that is hard to put down, and leaves the reader looking for the next installment."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19714757-alan", "userReview": "Wow! Exhausting! Nonstop action from beginning to end. The book is a \u201c stand-alone\u201c, so previous books in the series do not affect it\u2019s enjoyment.I read it in four days,with sleep and food optional.I highly recommend it ,and I will read other books by these authors."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9879265-andrew", "userReview": "Pretty good debut, with an interesting story-line and a captivating main character in Vick 'The Reaper' Harwood.

Storyline was awesome. The only complaint I have is the jumps from one location to another we\u2019re jagged and not as smooth! That doesn\u2019t take away from it being a great book!

Tata that I have read. I have read much praise of the latter, but with him just appearing as a second-tier co-author on this book, I must assume that Irving is primarily responsible for the novel. I will make this review fairly short by summing up that I was fairly well entertained as the pages flew by, but the plot has so many reality gaps and shortcuts that I was never truly convinced by the twists and false leads that Irving included in the story. Fans of e.g. Brad Taylor might like this book as well as the series it appears to be the first part of, but if you are more into geopolitical terrorism and suspense, as in books by Vince Flynn and Brad Thor, you will be left wanting by this book.[An ARC of the book was generously provided by the publisher through NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review]"}], "description": "American hero, or unhinged vigilante?Vick \"The Reaper\" Harwood is an esteemed sniper with a record kill count\u201433 kills in 90 days\u2014when he is knocked out under mortar attack in Afghanistan. He wakes up back in the United States with little memory of what happened, his spotter and gun both unrecovered from the battlefield. Harwood has resigned himself to slowly picking up the pieces of his life, training Special Forces snipers in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and starting a promising relationship with an Olympic medalist named Jackie.But when a series of assassinations start occurring in the area, Harwood can't explain why he just happens to be nearby for each killing\u2014or how a sniper rifle that matches the description of the one he lost seems to be involved. His memory of the past few days is hazy and full of blackouts, and even he has to wonder, is he being framed? Or is he the killer?As Harwood runs from the authorities, his girlfriend falls off the radar, his missing spotter resurfaces, and the assassinated men are outed as drug and sex traffickers. Nothing is adding up. Harwood realizes he has to unravel this mystery, and fast, or find himself paying the ultimate price for crimes he may not have committed.", "title": "Reaper: Ghost Target\n      \n          (The Reapers  #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36413227-reaper", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508011507l/36413227.jpg", "reviews": 12, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6037180.Nicholas_Irving", "name": "Nicholas Irving"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2752170.A_J_Tata", "name": "A.J.
