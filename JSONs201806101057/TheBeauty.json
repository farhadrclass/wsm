It is altogether fascinating, with a sinister progression of themes and ideas, but it ends too soon, and Nate's narration keeps much of the story at arms' length.In an undefined future, the world has been overcome by a fungal infection that has taken the lives of every single woman, young and old. The men who survive them know that they are to be the last generation, and exist in a sad sort of limbo, living for stories of the past. When strange yellow mushrooms begin growing from the women's graves, curiosity leads a trio of lonely men into an encounter with new life - oddly beautiful, inexplicably arousing feminine figures formed of soft, spongy, organic material.And that's only where it begins to get weird.Beneath all the dystopian horror and sci-fi surrealism, this is a fascinating look at gender, gender roles, and what it means to be human. Strangely, however, it is only after the arrival of The Beauty that the men begin to change. Where the promise of impending doom brought them together in a sorrowful sort of brotherhood, the question of new life - creepy and disturbing as it is - rekindles in them a desire to survive, setting them at odds with one another. That's where the story gets really interesting, and where I wish there were another narrator to broaden the story. While we see how the men have changed, it's a superficial appreciation, without the deeper emotional understanding that I think would have kicked this up a notch.There's so much I want to say about the body horror and gender bending here, but it's one of those stories that needs to be experienced. It's weird, creepy, unsettling, disturbing, and more, with ever-bigger secrets revealed along the way. I want more, whether it be a sequel or a companion piece, but what's here is fantastically compelling.http://beauty-in-ruins.blogspot.ca/20..."}, {"userName": "fromcouchtomoon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12222751-fromcouchtomoon", "userReview": "A fabulous metaphorical delight! What happens when impossible beauty ideals become a fungus that infects women and brainwashes men? More than a commentary on gender roles, this disturbing little tale places blame squarely on the society that sets, perpetuates, and prioritizes physical female beauty over human love and shared responsibility. Fantastic truncated paragraph style, too. Nice and rhythmic."}, {"userName": "Rafaela", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1938822-rafaela", "userReview": "NOTE: This book was provided by the publisher, through NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.(link to review on my blog soon)Why did I read this book? Because the blurb promised me a world without women. Not \"a world without women except for one who for some reason didn't die\", but \"a world without women, full stop\". And let me tell you, to feminist me, this sounded incredibly intriguing.So I gave it a shot.This book, let me tell you, is a powerhouse. The story follows Nate, the resident storyteller in a small community of men who have chosen to live their last days in a quiet, isolated settlement - they call it Valley of the Rocks. The women are gone, dead and buried, but their memory lives on in Nate's stories, and the collective consciousness they shape in a world where history is but the spoken word.This delicate balance doesn't last, though, and when a strange breed of mushroom starts popping up around the cemetery (look at that cover!), the small community is in for the ultimate takedown on their identity.I won't spoil you with details, because I believe this is one book that should truly be savoured in all its twists and turns - but what Aliya Whiteley has achieved here is nothing short of incredible. Probably the most exquisitely orchestrated deconstruction of gender roles I have ever read in my life.The book is beautifully written, the prose haunting but subtle. The pacing left a little to be desired at first (it's a small book, and I felt it took some time to reach its point of no return), but the second half was so daring, so... I can't even find a word to describe it, so impossibly strange yet easy to accept, considering the setting, that I just can't blame the beginning for lulling me into a sense of pseudo-normalcy.Halfway through, I was telling like-minded friends \"this is the weirdest thing I've ever read\". But as soon as I was finished, I was telling those same like-minded friends \"you HAVE to read this\". Long story short, I was completely floored by this book, and I cannot recommend it enough.Four stars, might bump it up to five if it stays in the back of my mind long enough. It probably will."}, {"userName": "Eleni (OverThePlace)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5813462-eleni-overtheplace", "userReview": "Like tripping on mushrooms (or having sex with them).Literally, that's the whole plot.

In this book, beauty and frailty interlink with terror and perversion in a unique way. I applaud the author for her bravery to write speculative fiction that is boldly different, deeply unsettling and strikingly original. She's one of the few authors who dare to explore difficult themes in a transgressive and thought-provoking way.The title story, \"The Beauty\", tells of a post-apocalyptic society of men and boys where all women have died because of a fungus plague. The members of the society gather around the fire each night and listen to tales recounted by their storyteller, Nate. Nate's stories keep alive the memories of what has happened. Nate has witnessed signs of change and regeneration in the graveyard where the women's bodies lie beneath the soil, because mushrooms form outlines of the buried women. One day Nathan meets a strange yellow, spongy and limbed thing in the woods. This strange creature has the shape of a woman.Nate is a fascinating protagonist, because he tells stories to his fellow men. His stories reveal what has happened and how things have changed since the women died of the plague. The other characters are also interesting and the author writes fluently about their actions.In my opinion, Aliya Whiteley's vision of a post-apocalyptic world is fascinatingly harrowing and haunting. As the events begin to unfold, the author steers her story towards enticing heights of strangeness that are often left unexplored. She examines metamorphoses, parasitic fungi, gender roles, social dynamics and leadership issues in a mesmerising way.\"The Beauty\" can be seen as the ultimate reading experience in fungal horror fiction, because it's a an unsettling story about a strange fungal presence. It's totally different from normal horror fiction due to its unapologetic way of chilling the reader's heart and mind with brilliantly disturbing imagery.The additional story, \"Peace, Pipe\", which is exclusive to this edition of The Beauty, is an excellent story about communication between a human being and an alien being. It demonstrates the author's versatility as a writer, because it's different from \"The Beauty\", but has a few connections to the themes explored in it.In this novelette, the unnamed narrator has been quarantined after a space mission and starts to hear an alien voice coming from behind the wall. The voice belongs to a being called Pipe, a mysterious water-based life form. Pipe is unlike any other alien species the narrator has come across, because it learns fast and is highly intelligent. The narrator is intrigued about Pipe and the mystery that surrounds it.I was fascinated by this novelette, because the author explores how human beings could establish communication with different life forms and how they could come to understand them. I like the author's way of addressing the difficulties involved in reaching a sufficient level of understanding, because she does it well.What makes \"Peace, Pipe\" unique is that Aliya Whiteley plays intriguingly with the idea that Pipe may not be an alien being after all, but merely a gurgling water pipe making strange sounds. This impressed me, because the possibility of everything being only imagination adds a brilliant touch of strangeness to the story.Aliya Whiteley's literary prose will entice everybody who appreciates beautiful storytelling and literary fiction. Her prose is not merely subtly beautiful and wonderfully nuanced, but also emotional and heartbreaking. She writes captivatingly about strange happenings and delves deep into hidden wells of weirdness that are seldom explored by speculative fiction authors. I admire her writing skills, because she effortlessly evokes a sense of strangeness and pays attention to creating an unsettling atmosphere. Her fiction has a harrowing and unsettling edge to it that will impress readers.The Beauty is a prime example of why speculative fiction is a powerful force to reckon with and should not be overlooked by anybody. It contains bold ideas and unforgettable imagery that you will never find in mainstream fiction, and what's best, it's filled with beautiful literary prose that highlights the strange happenings.If you yearn to read something amazing, unsettling and heartbreaking, I advise you to take a look at Aliya Whiteley's The Beauty, because it's a unique masterpiece of literary weirdness from a gifted author with a stunning and original voice of her own. This book belongs to everybody's bookshelf who loves the darker and weirder side of speculative fiction, because the title story is simply amazing. The additional story, \"Peace, Pipe\" serves as a wonderful counterbalance to the strangeness of the title story, because it's fascinating and heartbreaking in a different way. Trust me when I say that literary weird fiction doesn't get any better than this, so make sure that you'll read this book as soon as possible.Very highly recommended!--- --- ---The original review:Originally published at Risingshadow.Aliya Whiteley's The Beauty is one of the best and most fascinating novellas I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Considering the vast amount of speculative fiction being written nowadays, it's wonderful to read beautifully written and original novellas like this that truly stand out from the dull and grey mass and fully capture the reader's imagination with strange happenings.The Beauty is a strangely captivating and unsettling novella filled with melancholy darkness and wistfulness. It's possible that this novella may be quite a disturbing reading experience to those who are not used to reading thought-provoking speculative fiction and literary dark fiction, but I'm sure that it will permanently impress everyone who reads it, because it's boldy different from other speculative fiction stories. It will amaze, enchant and shock readers in equal measure.The Beauty contains many New Weird and dark fantasy elements. These elements form a powerful and vibrant combination that pulses with stunning originality. Depending on the reader, this novella can either be classified as New Weird or literary strange fiction.Here's a bit of information about the story:- The story is divided into four parts.- The events take place years after all the women have died. Only men have survived (they seem to be unaffected by the fungus plague that has killed the women).- A young man called Nathan, who lives in a remote and isolated commune, has witnessed signs of change and regeneration in the graveyard where the women are buried. Mushrooms form outlines of the women who have been buried beneath the soil. One day Nathan meets a strange yellow, spongy and limbed thing in the woods. This strange creature has the shape of a woman...This is all I'll write about the story, because it wouldn't be fair to give away too many details about its amazing and unsettling wonders, because the author has plenty of surprises in store for her readers.Nate is a fascinating protagonist who tells stories each night to his fellow men. His stories keep alive the memories of what has happened and reveal how things have changed since the women passed away. They also shape the lives of the men by giving voice and meaning to the strange occurrences.Aliya Whiteley's vision of a post-apocalyptic world has quiet and unsettling power that grows into enticing heights of strangeness as the events begin to unfold. The frictions, dynamics and leadership issues between the different men are handled vividly.It was interesting for me to read about how the men had to deal with an unexpected deconstruction of gender roles, because they faced certain events that shook their lives. I liked the way the author wrote about this, because she created a sophisticatedly unsettling atmosphere and let the story unfold at its own speed.The Beauty is a well-constructed story about change. When the creatures, the Beauty, enter the men's lives, everything begins to change. Some of the changes are unsettlingly strange and cause the men to think about their lives, community and survival. Besides being a story about change, it's also a story about weird metamorphosis and parasitic fungi.One of the most important reasons why I find this novella fascinating is that it has an intriguing sense of myth and strangeness to it. This is not often found in modern literary strange fiction. It also have a feel of William Golding's Lord of the Flies to it, but the author steers the story towards New Weird.Aliya Whiteley is an exceptionally gifted speculative fiction author whose writing abilities I admire. Her subtle prose is beautiful and eloquent. She has the ability to create thought-provoking, mesmerising and distubing images in the reader's mind by writing boldly about challenging and mature themes. Her story is a brilliant combination of wondrous and disturbing elements.Based on this novella, I can say that Aliya Whitley is an author who deserves to be read and praised. I intend to read her next novella, The Arrival of Missives (Unsung Stories, 2016), as soon as possible.The Beauty is a stunning feast of originality and will impress readers who appreciate beautiful prose, sophisticated storytelling, new weird elements and literary strange fiction. It's speculative fiction at its utmost best and most imaginative. I recommend it to fans of the darker and weirder side of speculative fiction, because its dark beauty beckons to be explored by speculative fiction readers. I can guarantee that once you've read this novella, you won't easily forget it.Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Lau ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7597758-lau", "userReview": "3.75\n\u00abBeauty is a word that has a different meaning for me now and I am delighted to have reclaimed it.\u00bb\n\nThe Beauty\n es por lejos uno de los libros m\u00e1s bizarros que he le\u00eddo en mucho tiempo, y si no fuera por la habilidad de la autora para narrar de un modo que por momentos es hasta po\u00e9tico, la historia ser\u00eda repugnante. O mejor dicho, la idea de la historia es retorcida y desagradable, pero gracias a lo bien escrito que est\u00e1, eso pasa a segundo plano.\u00c9ste es un mundo postapocal\u00edptico donde por culpa de una espantosa enfermedad nacida en los \u00fateros, las mujeres se extinguieron. No se dice abiertamente, pero es obvio que la humanidad tiene los d\u00edas contados, y los hombres que quedan recuerdan a las mujeres que amaron con una nostalgia que roza el misticismo.Pero un d\u00eda ocurre algo inesperado (y perturbador) en la comunidad cerrada en la que se desarrolla la historia. De las tumbas de las mujeres comienzan a crecer hongos amarillos que pronto se transforman en cabezas femeninas sin facciones y posteriormente en cuerpos completos. Estos hongos hongas cobrar\u00e1n vida y tratar\u00e1n por todos los medios de acercarse a los hombres, con una mezcla de pasividad, seducci\u00f3n y maternalidad que muchos no van a poder resistir. Algo as\u00ed como un complejo de Edipo pero m\u00e1s, er, mic\u00f3tico, al que no pude dejar de encontrarle un cierto aire (retorcido) a Ad\u00e1n y Eva.El protagonista es Nate, un hombre joven aunque de edad indefinida que es el encargado de contar historias y mantener vivo el recuerdo de las mujeres. Nate va a ser secuestrado por una de las hongas,\u00a0y precisamente por su rol de \"bardo\" ser\u00e1 uno de los principales motores del cambio que se va a obrar en la comunidad.De todos modos aunque Nate es el narrador, la historia no gira completamente en torno a \u00e9l sino que muchas veces es algo as\u00ed como un espectador pasivo que observa pero no se involucra, y que oscilar\u00e1 entre el horror y la fascinaci\u00f3n.Estoy muy sorprendida con esta historia. Alcanza unos niveles de bizarrismo incre\u00edbles, a\u00fan cuando parece que ya el argumento no puede ser m\u00e1s extra\u00f1o. Hay muchas escenas muy bien armadas que son escalofriantes y de alg\u00fan modo hacen que se sienta cierta suciedad al leerlas, y a pesar de todo, con la habilidad de la autora, muchos de esos momentos altamente perturbadores est\u00e1n inexplicablemente rodeados de p\u00e1rrafos muy po\u00e9ticos y resulta una experiencia casi agradable. Casi.Me gust\u00f3 especialmente el desarrollo psicol\u00f3gico de los personajes. Las hongas ser\u00e1n llamadas\u00a0\u00abLa Belleza\u00bb,\u00a0por su aspecto femenino y cuerpo deseable, y sin embargo a causa de su falta de rostro, piel amarillenta y textura esponjosa nunca dejar\u00e1n de nombrarlas como\u00a0eso (no los culpo realmente).Teniendo en cuenta que es un libro de pocas p\u00e1ginas, todo aquel personaje que es importante para la historia tiene su espacio y vemos su evoluci\u00f3n \u2013o quiz\u00e1s involuci\u00f3n\u2013 con la aparici\u00f3n de\u00a0La Belleza.\nThe Beauty\n es una mezcla extra\u00f1a que por momentos produce tanta repulsi\u00f3n como inter\u00e9s con sus giros inesperados y bizarros, y esa es claramente la intenci\u00f3n. A pesar de todo a\u00fan no se bien qu\u00e9 pensar sobre el final, no me decido sobre si me pareci\u00f3 abrupto o si simplemente me hubiera gustado que siguiera un poco m\u00e1s.\u00c9sta no es una lectura c\u00f3moda, pero no por eso deja de ser buena e interesante.Rese\u00f1a de Fantas\u00eda M\u00e1gica"}, {"userName": "Grace Troxel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6079682-grace-troxel", "userReview": "This review originally appeared on my blog, Books Without Any Pictures: http://bookswithoutanypictures.com/20...3.5 stars.One of the great things about being a book blogger is that you are introduced to books that you otherwise would never have heard of or considered reading. I received a review request from a small speculative fiction publisher based out of the UK called Unsung Stories for a novella called The Beauty, which is quite possibly one of the most bizarre books I\u2019ve ever read.The Beauty is a post-apocalyptic horror story set in a world without women. A disease managed to wipe out every female human on the planet, and the surviving men know that they\u2019re the last of their kind before their inevitable extinction. Nate is a storyteller for a community of men who have moved away from the city and are living off the land. His stories help them to remember the past and to come to terms with the future.One day, strange mushrooms begin growing on the ground where the corpses of the women were buried. The mushrooms had strange properties that would forever change the fate of mankind. *cue ominous music* It\u2019s hard to write the rest of this review without entering into spoiler territory, but I will do my best.Reading The Beauty required a certain suspension of disbelief from readers. There are currently approximately 7 billion people on the planet. That means that there are approximately 3.5 billion women, give or take. There\u2019s enough genetic diversity in the human population that I don\u2019t think all 3.5 billion women would be susceptible to the same disease. It would be a bit more believable if there were at least a few survivors. I understand the necessity of the lack of women for the plot, but I felt like killing them all off is in and of itself a bit of a stretch.That being said, the lack of women is what enables Whitely to create a commentary on the fluidity of gender roles and the degree to which they are determined by societal pressure versus inherent nature. When there are no women, men don\u2019t feel the need to be as \u201cmanly\u201d, and people seem to sort themselves out according to their own whims, which can be mutable over time. This becomes especially evident after the arrival of the Beauty, which create a social incentive for the men to take on roles that were traditionally female.Nate uses his stories to interpret the changes in society, but many of the men in the community are resistant to change. It\u2019s not like they had any choice in the matter. I see Nate\u2019s stories as being ideologically driven. He\u2019s trying to rewrite the past and the present to create a better (or at least different) world, and I get the sense that for him it\u2019s a coping mechanism and a way of reassuring himself that maybe he isn\u2019t as doomed as he thinks he is. It\u2019s a way to cling to hope, no matter how thin it might be, and in order for anyone to survive, each person needs to let go of their own identities and allow themselves to be reshaped into something new and alien to their prior experiences.The Beauty isn\u2019t among my favorites, but it is a curious piece of work. Nate\u2019s voice is quite strong, even if I found some of the setup a bit weak. The book\u2019s surreal and nightmarish quality has haunted my thoughts for the past week, and I feel as if it will leave a lasting impression."}, {"userName": "Eliza Graham", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3618460-eliza-graham", "userReview": "What is a woman?

The idea here is so cool: all the women in the world contract a strange fungus-based illness and die. After their death, mushrooms start growing on their graves and eventually turn into weird sentient mushroom-women. I HATE mushrooms really passionately (are you a plant? an animal?! make up your damn mind!) so this was particularly horrifying for me. But overall this novella was all shock and no substance. It's obviously supposed to be an allegory for gender relations, roles, and expectations but it seems very heavy-handed. Maybe I'm missing something because this has great reviews, but I found the messages trite. Yes indeed, rape culture and forced motherhood and toxic masculinity are bad things, I don't need a book to tell me that. Not only that, but the delivery is just... strange. This is not magical realism or fantasy, it's horror. Really extreme body horror. Which is actually a genre I love, but I feel like all of the gross-out moments were included just to make the reader uncomfortable. So we can look at our own ideas of gender, I'm sure, and ~deconstruct~ why we find these scenes so upsetting. But let's be honest, they're upsetting because they are gross as hell and overly violent for no reason. It doesn't really serve the plot, no that there's much of one.

They sucked up through the soil all the softness, serenity, hope and happiness of womankind.I\u2019m not the sort of reader who shies away from anything odd or bizarre, and many of the books I've read and enjoyed can be described in just that way. I was anxious to check out Unsung Stories, a new UK-based publisher who \u201c\u2026are publishers of great weird fiction that defies categorization.\u201d After some very positive experiences with other small publishers of the weird and uncategorizable, like Apex Books and Salt Publishing, I eagerly accepted The Beauty for review. And I can honestly say that, yes, this book defies categorization, and it most certainly falls under the genre of weird fiction.So while this story was visually stunning and creative and strange, did I enjoy it? I guess up to a point I did, but then the weird kept escalating and ultimately became too much for me. (I can\u2019t believe I just typed those words!) I do believe the author\u2019s point to the story was to take a look at the way we define \u201cgender\u201d and turn that notion on its head.But part of my enjoyment of fiction stems from being able to connect to the characters, to understand them and root for them and feel emotions right along with them. And unfortunately, I had a hard time with both the men and the women in The Beauty. Let\u2019s set the scene for you, shall we? The story takes place some time in the future after a horrible fungus begins killing all the women. People have moved out of the cities and set up camp in small groups, perhaps in order to better survive this virus. One such group lives in a wilderness area, and the wives, sisters, and mothers of all the men have died, leaving them alone, with no female companionship. The men are sad about this, but nevertheless they gather around the campfire each night where one of them, a man named Nathan, tells stories about their past, reliving the memories of the women they loved and lost, and generally trying to keep these memories alive for the younger members of the group.But something strange is happening. Odd-looking mushrooms are starting to grow over the graves of the women, and one day Nathan falls into a pit in the forest and is attacked by a monstrous creature that seems to be made of mushrooms. When he regains consciousness, he takes the creature, who he calls \u201cBeauty,\u201d back to camp with him. The men are shocked by the Beauty\u2019s yellow, spongy skin and strange, non-verbal way of communicating. But Nathan convinces them that she has come to make their lives better. Eventually, more of the creatures join the group and soon each man has his own Beauty. It\u2019s almost as if their dead women are back again.But not all the men are happy with the sudden arrival of the Beauty, and before long, dissent threatens to tear the group apart.So what happens when a society loses its women? Well, aside from the obvious\u2014no sex with women!\u2014the society is in danger of disappearing, because hey, no more children. Whiteley takes her story in some unexpected directions with this idea as a jumping off point. I won't tell you what happens, because that would spoil things, but I did like the way the men react to what unfolds after the Beauty join them. I love when peaceful groups of people suddenly turn on each other, and Whiteley's story shines the most when the group begins to unravel.Whiteley\u2019s Beauties are strangely compelling creations. Although they don\u2019t speak, they work out a way to communicate with the men. They seem to appear just when the men need them most, but the Beauty also have a violent streak that was quite shocking. To be honest, I liked them more than the men in the story, but only just.I guess what bothered me most about this story was the oddness of the men's feelings for the Beauty, who seem to come out of nowhere and mesmerize the men until they can think of nothing else but being with and having sex with these odd, mushroom women. I'm sure the author is making a statement or two about sexual role reversals, but by about the mid-point of the story, Whiteley takes the weirdness to a very unsettling level, and at that point I began to mentally check out.Many reviewers loved this book\u2014you have only to look at all the four-and-five star ratings on Goodreads. If Whiteley's goal was to challenge the way we think about gender, then she certainly accomplished that task. Unfortunately, The Beauty had just a little too much \"weird\" for me to completely enjoy.Big thanks to Unsung Stories for providing a review copy.This review originally appeared on Books, Bones & Buffy."}, {"userName": "C.J.

It focuses particularly (although not exclusively) on issues of gender and asks allegorical questions that are uncomfortable and unflinching. But never mind all that. Even if you're not of a philosophical bent, this is a grotesque, entertaining fable that moves at a rate of knots and has some gleefully fucked up ideas. At times, you can feel Whiteley grinning at the keyboard as she comes up with ever-imaginative ways to provoke the reader into a response and it works splendidly.

Fungus begins growing on the graves of dead women and bloom into fungal approximations of women. Sounds disturbing right? That's not even half of it.

What if all women die from a fungal disease and kind of sort of come back as mushroom creatures to feel loved again? To repopulate this rapidly declining world?

Yes, The Beauty is about that, but it\u2019s also\u2026 more that detracts a great deal from what the reader expects going into the novel. Though this is how it begins, the plot quickly progresses into a sci-fi/horror story about strange creatures slowly invading the men\u2019s lives.It was then that I took a look at the notes section and realised that it was classified as New Weird. Now, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of that genre, as previously I would have simply classified a novella like this one as horror/sci-fi. New Weird works much better and is a perfect fit for The Beauty.The writing itself is amazing and worth five stars alone. Whiteley\u2019s word choice and structure is superb. Her word craft is exquisite and not something I expected to find when I started reading. In fact, there are so many wonderful, quotable parts to the book that I eventually had to force myself to stop highlighting passages because I would\u2019ve highlighted everything. If you just want to read an amazingly written story, regardless of genre, then you cannot go wrong with The Beauty.If you\u2019re wondering, after reading the previous paragraph, why I reviewed the story at three stars instead of something higher, it\u2019s simply because of the strangeness of the plot. If you\u2019re a fan of Weird, then this has a good chance of becoming a four or five star novella. If you aren\u2019t, then an almost four star review might be as high as you\u2019ll get.Readers learn early on that it was a type of fungal disease that killed off all of the women \u2014 in the world the men of the story speculate. A yellow fungus grew out of women, emanating from the womb it would seem until it consumed them whole. Now, six years later, the same fungus is seen growing on the graves of the women whose lives they took. Nathan, the narrator and group storyteller responsible for cultivating their history and the memories of women alive, is concerned and voices them to the de facto leader of the group, William, who dismisses his concerns. He then takes group cook Thomas to determine whether they are edible and they determine that they are likely poisonous. Finally, Nathan brings a sample back to Doctor Ben so he can study them in case they have medicinal benefits, or at least to discover if it is soon coming for the men. Once evening falls and it is time for the group to begin their storytelling, Nathan realises that a few people are missing. He goes off in search of them and instead finds himself in trouble when he comes face to face with a creature made completely of the yellow fungus.The rest, well, you\u2019ll have to read it for yourselves as I really don\u2019t want to spoil the story for anyone interested. It is good, it is thought provoking, but above all it is weird, and we could all use a bit of weird in our lives sometimes.Review first published on ByLuluWithLove"}, {"userName": "Merrill Chapman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33054729-merrill-chapman", "userReview": "Full fathom five thy father lies,Of his bones are coral made,Those are pearls that were his eyes,Nothing of him that doth fade,But doth suffer a sea-change,into something rich and strange...Shakespeare, The TempestClosely related to the man vs. woman Sci-Fi genre I discussed in my review of Space Games is the other-side-of-the-species bows out sub-genre.

Over time, the collective conscious of the writing community has dispensed gender extinction fairly evenly The girls go down in Frank Herbert's The White Plague. A bereaved scientist develops a virus to wipe out the world's women in retaliation for an IRA terrorist attack that kills his wife and daughters. During the 60's, I read a British novel, whose name for the life of me I cannot remember, in which an evil corporation wipes out the guys via distribution of a drug with a very unexpected side effect. In the New Outer Limits episode \"Lithia,\" the guys go down for the long count because of war and our inability to get along with women. (It's too bad the author of this episode didn't have the chance to watch some episodes of one of those \"Real Housewives\" shows. It might have changed his/her perception on the issue of female cooperative instincts.)Now, the girls are up again for the long sleep in The Beauty The novel (really a novella) is set in a near-time dystopian future in which all the Earth's women have died, victims of a slow-acting fungal infection that eventually overwhelms them. We are never told the origin of the plague nor the precise timeline in which it appears. The Beauty is not a techno-thriller but rather a parable about the relationship between the sexes and our inability to remain whoe in the absence of our natural partners.As they succumb one by one, the wives, sisters, and mothers of mankind are buried in communal graveyards in which eukaryotic strands and garlands wrap themselves around the corpses in their unquiet resting places.

Wow. I think this tiny seemingly harmless book threw me a bit off balance. It starts off slow and mysterious and you think it\u2019s going to turn out something like \u2018The Screwfly Solution\u2019, but it wounds up becoming a surrealistic fable of gender signifiers. I\u2019ve just finished it and I kind of think I should re-read it for a proper review/analysis. But for now I\u2019ll write this based on a single read. After all, I think feeling so weirded out is a significant part of the appeal of the tale.So basically, we start off in a world where women have perished as a result of a female-exclusive plague. Of the women remain the stories, carefully kept together by our main character, the storyteller Nate. But all of a sudden, mushrooms start growing on top of the women\u2019s graves. And then... a new sort of story comes to flesh.It is so hard to review this without giving away spoilers; after all, all the good stuff happens on the second half of the book. It becomes so weird, like a Shirley Jackson story, but yet so surreal, and so meaningful. As I was reading this, I kept thinking: \u2018gosh, I wish someone would write a Freudian analysis of this\u2019. I might even do it myself, if there comes a time in which I\u2019m really bored. This book is a never-ending source of good sexual considerations and their implication on power relations. Power also relates to storytelling. And truth. There is such a lovely concern with telling the truth in stories.Lastly, the imagery is excellent. I wish there was a short film of this, but it\u2019s probably best there isn\u2019t. I am pretty sure the mere words on paper will be enough to give me fleshy dreams.P.S. \u2013 The only correction: mushrooms are not plants."}, {"userName": "Romany Arrowsmith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4449947-romany-arrowsmith", "userReview": "[new quasi-human lifeforms that creep out of the earth to take the dead women's places (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Reanna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5526922-reanna", "userReview": "This one was just maybe too weird, too out there, for me to really enjoy.

I try to tell them the same way, but each telling leads to small changes; something is added to the structure, a change of pace, a tweak of testimonies, all of them make circles in our minds.\u2019 (p.10)This is a stunning story, a mesmerizing piece of speculative fiction. Whiteley\u2019s lyrical prose is poetic, her descriptions of the characters\u2019 natural surroundings both beautiful and disturbing. There is wisdom in here. Also a deep understanding of the human condition and gender roles. Here are a few examples:\u2018The windmill turns, the fire jumps high and the river tumbles over the stones. It grows dark and the wild goats bleat in chorus, giving their sad farewells to the sun.\u2019 (p.11)\u2018The wrongness sweeps over me, obliterates the butterflies, leaves only black insect legs, squirming and scrabbling in my mind.\u2019 (p.21)\u2018Sleep is a truth that will not come readily to those who fill their minds with pretense, so I sit up and watch my breath billow out into the December cold.\u2019 (p.61)At only 99 pages, this will be a quick read for most.

A 94-page gem of a story that will haunt you with its imagery and leave you sadly resigned to the nature of man (and woman).The structure and rhythm of the language was a reading pleasure in its own right let alone the multi-levelled layers of meaning and intent. On the surface, the vision of the world that is portrayed with men lost without women, waiting to end the last generation of humanity and keeping their memories alive through stories is unsettling but the coming of the strange and mysterious Beauty promises a relief. However, the upheaval, the shift in roles, the oppression, dependency, horror and bloodshed of the new world reflect so many of the horrors found in our own reality. The subtle yet insightful considerations of women's power when removed from society and the dominance of a stronger gender over a weaker one is frighteningly (and sadly too often) reflective of the world today. I found it enthralling, not least because I found the imagery so disturbing and the language so rhythmic, well structured and not a single superfluous word or phrase in the whole of it.

This novel is one of the strangest, most horrifying, most provocative, most distressingly violent, most creative, most transgressive, and most thoughtful and feminine stories I have read in the last three years.

Please. It is a sin that this book is not more well known. I want Aliya Whiteley to have all the money and all the book awards. I won't describe the premise of this book, because any other summary or book jacket synopsis has already done it well. It is everything the summaries say, but so much more. And the more is worth reading in the story, not knowing beforehand. That which I loved most about this book is also that for which I must give the greatest warning. This is a disturbing story of body horror. It is explicit. I have read queer/trans pornography with some of this book's most basic premises, written less explicitly, and without this book's body crawling details. But it's so good. And it is so short. I swear, it needs a sequel. I read it twice, the second time was straight through. After the title story, the novella I am praising like a brainwashed cult member, is a shorter story called Peace, Pipe. Though I can't call this story as crazymaking fantastic as The Beauty, I did also enjoy it enough to read it twice. I most appreciated how Peace, Pipe builds on the themes of language and anxiety in communication that are introduced and developed in different ways in The Beauty. Both stories have protagonists that are wordsmiths and communicators by trade. Both protagonists spend much of the story ruminating on the responsibility of a storyteller or linguist, and the potentially dire consequences of misunderstanding or miscommunication. Peace, Pipe also continues the theme of great loneliness, and the need for companionship. And, to a lesser degree, both stories also play with ideas of different ways life, even intelligent life, could evolve, and our relationship to plants, animals, and the natural world. It's inclusion in this book isn't necessary, as The Beauty carries the book just fine on its own, even if the book would be thin without it. But it is a welcome and well chosen inclusion, harmonizing well with the title story. And I appreciated the opportunity to read more by this intriguing new voice. I know this may not be the most in depth analysis that I could give this book. But my hope is only to encourage new readers to pick it up. It will definitely provoke its own thoughts, ideas, and responses. As I mentioned, I read both stories in this book twice in the last few days. However, the first time I read The Beauty, I had some of my arthritis medication (which has some acute side effects for the first couple hours after taking) while I was on Page 44. By Page 48, my medication had kicked in, and the book had also kicked in . . . my brain. It was a bit of a shock, including some sudden incidents that indicated a direction I certainly did not expect. In fact, I didn't even yet know that what I was reading was a horror novel. I thought it was just highly imaginative contemporary science fiction.Anyway, I began writing as I read, and also texting my (poor, dear, patient) brother. I could hardly believe what I was reading was real, wondering if it was just exhaustion, pain, or the medication messing with me. So shocked was I, that I reread the entire thing the following day in one sitting, just to confirm that it really was the mindfuck it seemed to be the night before. It was. It is. I will end with the following, which I made of everything I wrote, after I finished The Beauty the first time, before rereading it to confirm that it does indeed deserve this kind of shocked enthusiasm. Enjoy:~~~(Page 48) Either this novel is about a post-woman apocalypse where mushroom-shagging men are mind controlled by sentient fungus to start dressing like women and is also among the best science fiction novels I've ever read, or this new arthritis medication has just really opened this book for me in a strange way. SPOILERS (maybe?)Holy shit. Page 70. If I thought Page 48 was trippy, I was certainly not yet prepared for the next 43 pages. The Beauty is like if Ridley Scott's Xenomorph face-fucked Jeff VanderMeer and forced him to carry a parasitic hybrid baby that grew up to be a thoughtful, gender bending, queer feminist. Like, Annihilation meets David Cronenberg, meets H.R. Giger, plus queer. On drugs. In bed. Fucking read it, motherfucker. This fucker will fucking blow your motherfucking mind. Horror as fuck. It fucking turns the hetero story, the cisgender, gender role performing patriarchal norm, into a horror story. It's a fucking disease. Let gendernormativity fucking die. Let the binary fucking die.

I know there are a few editions of this book floating around, so for clarification, my edition is the newly released one with the stories 'The Beauty' and 'Peace, Pipe'. I picked up this book because I saw it in an issue of Book Page and, when I read the synopsis, I thought it sounded very similar to 'Sleeping Beauties' by Stephen & Owen King that I had recently read at the beginning of December. While I did enjoy that book, it wasn't as deep and dark as I was hoping it was going to be. While both books have a lot of social commentary on men and women and gender roles, it felt like 'Sleeping Beauties' was focused more on disaster avoidance and trying to describe how the vast number of characters were dealing with the loss of so many women that there was not time to really describe the depth of anyone's emotional reaction to the situation. The Beauty: When I first starting reading this I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but the more of the story I read, the more I realized not only what the author was saying about the roles of men and women in society, but also the way in which she made these points. The use of Nate a storyteller and the way he creates so many stories filled with social commentary about the group in which he lives by weaving together fantastical stories to cover up the true meaning was a wonderful mirror to how Whiteley went about expressing her own opinions. I loved the situation created where the older men in the group were having so much trouble accepting the Beauty, while the younger teenagers were more quick to embrace them and incorporate them into their lives, even while they were mimicking the roles of men and creating a subservient attitude in the men of the group. I think this is a wonderful parallel to what we see in our society today where the younger generations are no longer willing to live life the way they are told, while their parent's generations insist on the status quo and that they know what is good for them. Overall 'The Beauty' is filled with a lot of interesting concepts that I was surprised to find in this small novel, but it was definitely a gut-punching story.Peace, Pipe:I honestly wasn't even going to read this story because I thought it sounded hella weird, but I am SO GLAD that i read it because I loved it. This story is so beautifully and painfully human and it touched me in my deepest feels. I would have given it a five star if it had focused more on the relationship between the unnamed narrator and Pipe and less on the external story of the threatened planet that the narrator has put in peril. I honestly wish this story had been longer and talked more about their early life and why it would lead them to create a fleeting but touching relationship with what they believe could be another alien creature on the other side of his wall in quarantine, but it probably (definitely) a water pipe in the wall constantly leaking water. The most heartbreaking part of this story for me was one, their decision to go forth into their future, knowing that they are leaving Pipe behind because they have to help their friend, and two, their acknowledgement that Pipe is probably just that, a water pipe in the wall, but that they decided to hold onto their perception of Pipe as something on the other side of the wall that they considered a friend. And honestly, the last page killed me the most."}, {"userName": "Michael Whiteman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20715369-michael-whiteman", "userReview": "This is a novella set in an isolated community in a world where women have all been killed by a disease that causes yellow mushrooms to consume them from the inside. Given that, it's easy to say it is very VanderMeer/New Weird but Whiteley does plenty in its 100 pages to set it apart. The unsettling imagery sticks with you and the questions of gender raised are incorporated into the story deftly. We start with Nate, the storyteller of the Group, who keeps alive the memories of the women who were part of the Group before the disease trying to persuade the others that the new mushrooms growing on the graves of the women are a sign of coming change. Obviously, nobody listens and soon the Beauty are among them, woman-shaped mushroom creatures that seem to want only to be loved by the men, as mothers, wives, companions. Some of the men welcome them and others keep themselves distant. Their arrival intensifies conflict between the older and younger generations, those mourning lost wives and daughters and the ones who barely remember the old world. The story takes weirder and weirder turns, with body horror and escalating violence as some of the men decide to act against what they see as only mushrooms and insults to the dead women, while others begin to see them as individual people with their own desires and needs. An intriguing look at social dynamics in an all-male group, memorably weird and fantastic."}], "description": "Somewhere away from the cities and towns, a group of men and boys gather around the fire each night to listen to their stories in the Valley of the Rocks.
