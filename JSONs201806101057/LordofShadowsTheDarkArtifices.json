It has the same amount of high-intensity, beautifully constructed, and deep, yet comedic content we love to see from  The Shadowhunter Chronicles .  Lord of Shadows  delves deeper into the Shadowhunter World than we've ever seen before. From the repercussions of the Cold Peace, the rising tensions between Downworlders and Shadowhunters, to the nuclear bombs waiting to detonate between character relationships, everything about this series expands into a bigger and better tale than I could have anticipated. I had so many theories going into this book and while some were confirmed, some were *basically* correct, others were  thoroughly off  but the execution was much greater than anything I could have imagined. Anything I could have asked for was either delivered as I wanted, or something I didn't even  know  I wanted until it was given to me. I loved that we were able to get more perspective from a variety of other characters (Kit, Ty, Livvy, Dru, & Diana). While I feel every character in this series has grown from book one to two, it really was a pleasure to learn more about this specific set of characters and get to know them better. We do also get four cameos from TMI characters which I was TOTALLY satisfied with and happy to see. But I do specifically feel that Emma, Julian, Mark, and Cristina have done more maturing than most. I just feel that with all the burdens each of them carry, they begin to face them head-on, which made me very proud. I think any reader who loves the TDA characters will be impressed with the character development in the sequel!As per usual, the plot of the next installment of  The Shadowhunter Chronicles  is insane. I love how effortlessly the stories of TMI, TID, even a bit of TLH, and somethings I can allude to for TWP are implemented into the present series. I loved all of the different journeys our protagonists went on; From London, to Cornwall, to Faerieland, to Idris, there's so much adventure and excitement to love. Of course, within that comes all of the devastation which no one is prepared for, but still flawlessly written, nonetheless.As always, I have to applaud Cassie for continuing to grow and improve her craft. I truly believe every single book in The Shadowhunter Chronicles gets better and better as the story deepens. I'm particularly impressed because I saw risks with  Lord of Shadows  that weren't always taken in past books and I stand by all decisions made (yes, even each of the deaths!) I'm satisfied, elated, heart-broken, and blown away all in one.Of course, I'd highly recommend reading Lord of Shadows. I cannot wait for you all to experience this story!"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6281284-andrea", "userReview": "Don't talk to me for like a week.

I'm usually up for them as long as my ship prevails in the end ;) but man did Cassie complicate things for every possible pairing in this book. Emma/Julian/Mark - I thought this triangle wasn't so bad after I was done with Lady Midnight cause I knew Emma and Julian couldn't be romantically involved but Cassie effed things up with E&J always finding ways to hold each other and kiss. It was like saying you hate your ex and then getting back together the next day. Kieran/Mark/Christina/Diego - this triangle was the weirdest of them all cause I had a feeling like they wouldn't mind a 3way (minus Diego who's cancelled)Livvy/Kit/Ty - erm... Is Cassie setting up Kit and Ty for a parabatai bond? Or are they going to date? I'm still not sure. I'm very much looking forward to witnessing the parabatai ceremony since I have no idea how that actually happens. Note: I've only read the first 4 TMI books, not the full series. I actually found out in LoS Clary and Simon are parabatai. Now I'm like 0_o TID>TMI Triangle drama overshadowed everything else and I ended up disappointed cause Clare went for cheap tricks and chaos. Tsk, tsk! And to think this book is over 700 pages long."}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "These books seriously just keep getting better and better. The writing has improved SO much and the characters here are my absolute favorites. And... I cannot believe I'm saying this, but I actually liked Jace and Clary.But just like with Lady Midnight, I was more into the actual characters than whatever the larger plot arc was. I guess I don't care that much about Malcom, Annabel, the book, the Shadow Lord, or most of that drama. Pretty sure anything (or nothing) could be happening and I'd be just as entertained because THESE PRECIOUS CHARACTERS are all so wonderful and I adore them so much. Cassandra Clare really is the queen of love triangles and forbidden romance, though (which hasn't always worked for me in the past). And even if the angst did get a bit excessive at times, I still rolled my eyes affectionately instead of in any sort of annoyance... because I actually CARE about everyone. Ughhh that ending wrecked me. I don't want to get into any of the plot or spoil anything, so I'll just say it was really fun to see Faerie, London, familiar old faces, and get to know the current characters better. One of them turns out to be transgender and I thought it was handled really well (but will defer to others who can say whether that's the case). I just love how much wonderful rep these stories have!I really do love every single character, but Ty is seriously one of my all-time favorites from any book. I'm still so thrilled to see such a caring, badass, complex kid who happens to be autistic. It's not his whole personality, nor is it something the story tries to shy away from or handle any differently. It's approached so matter-of-factly that I just want to hug the book. And Kit's relationship with Ty is amazing... I ship them as friends or a couple or whatever. I don't care. I just love them together so much. And I know I'm not spending time here gushing over Emma & Julian or Mark & Cristina & Kieran but the feels are still there. I also really admired how the plot managed to weave in obvious parallels for current social issues in a way that felt authentic instead of like some message beating you over the head. There's a fascist Cohort faction of the council that supports the Downworlder registry, believes they speak for a silent majority, and \n\"seek to return the Clave to a lost golden age. A time that never was, when Downworlders knew their place and Nephilim ruled in harmony. In truth, the past was a violent time, when Downworlders suffered and those Nephilim who possessed compassion and empathy were tormented and punished along with them.\"\"When a decision like [the Cold Peace] is made by a government, it emboldens those who are already prejudiced to speak their deepest thoughts of hate. They assume they are simply brave enough to say what everyone really thinks.\"\nSo that was one of the stronger parts of the plot. And I also love how much mythology and clever references are woven into these stories. Even the totally unintentional ones... like the Mirror of Galadriel scene. Ha. But for real, I had a lot of fun with this book and just wish we didn't have to wait so long for the next one!"}, {"userName": "Virginia Ronan \u2665 Herondale \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69106439-virginia-ronan-herondale", "userReview": "When it comes to Lord of Shadows I really don't even know where to start! I loved the book! I loved it so much I found myself \nrereading\n certain passages just because I couldn't help myself but had to experience them again and again. =)Cassie has always been one of my favourite authors and the more I read from her, the more I get captured in her world. It\u2019s not just the world of the Shadowhunters though, it\u2019s the entire package Cassandra Clare is giving to us. There were so many details and things I loved about this book and even though I will never have the time to list them all, I\u2019m still going to try to write a proper review. First of all I have to say that I love the world Cassandra Clare has built and even though it sometimes seems to be more than just cruel (\u201cSed lex dura lex\u201d) it never fails to captivate me. Well, truth be told most of the time it\u2019s even this kind of harshness that makes it so interesting, the obstacles and problems every single one of the Blackthorns has to overcome making the entire story line even more intoxicating and exciting. Thinking about it in retrospective the plot isn\u2019t even that amazing and if I had to pinpoint why I still loved every line of the book, I would say that it\u2019s the details and the love I found in every single word. \nIf you don\u2019t like spoilers you should stop to read now, if you\u2019re a sucker for spoilers: please feel free to continue! ;-P\nLove, I think that\u2019s actually the word that sums it up. There is love everywhere and all of the characters have plenty of it to give. There are Julian and Emma who try to fight their feelings, there are Ty and Kit who slowly but steadily seem to fall in love and there is the love triangle between Mark, Kieran and Cristina that left me almost breathless and broken. God I can\u2019t even say how much I loved all of those relationships! I had to laugh, I had to cry, I wanted to tear the book apart and throw it against a wall. The ending literally killed me and even though I finished the book about a month ago I\u2019m still far from being over it. Cassie how dare you to make such an ending!?!? I can\u2019t wait to read the next book and the mere thought to wait two years is already enough to leave me in anguish! How could you do this to your follow readers?!?!?! Well, enough of the ranting and back to the good stuff! Relationships are definitely something Cassandra Clare truly excels at and the more I read from her, the better her books seem to become. It\u2019s obvious that she put a lot of effort into her characters and their world and the little hints at some of the other books never cease to amuse me. \u201cThere were valuable first editions of books in the enormous library, most of them had been scribbled in by some idiot named Will H.\u201dJust to mention one of them. ;-PSo yes, since I liked the love relationships the most I\u2019m going to get into detail now:Emma & Julian:I adore Julian, I really do! He has the soul of an artist and he\u2019s so complex that I can\u2019t help but have to love him for it. I never met another character that was so driven by his love for his family, the fact he would do everything in order to protect his loved ones something that sometimes even gave me the chills. He is neither black nor white and his love for Emma only seems to emphasise his inner conflict. The tension between those two is almost tangible in the air and whenever I read about them I was reduced to a squealing fan girl. I really hope that they manage to find a way to break their parabatai bond and I don\u2019t even want think about what will happen now that Livvy died\u2026 \u201cWhy all these paintings of you? Because I'm an artist, Emma. These pictures are my heart. And if my heart was a canvas, every square inch of it would be painted over with you.\u201d \u2013 Julian BlackthornTy and Kit: I love, love, love and love those two!! Every time they interacted I had a smile on my face and felt oddly peaceful. Ty is such a gentle boy and Kit understands him so well. It\u2019s so obvious that the two of them care about each other deeply and even though Cassie is careful never to give us a palpable proof of their love, I was still able to read it in every single line. I liked all the parts that were from Kit\u2019s POV and since he\u2019s a Herondale I automatically loved him! *lol* I really hope there is going to be more of those two in the next book and I can\u2019t even say how much I ship them! =) \u201cHe let the shirt fall and grabbed a Tupperware container of cookies out of the fridge. Maybe he could frustrate the Shadowhunters by refusing to work out and sitting around eating carbs. I defy you, Shadowhunters, he thought, thumbing the top off the container and popping a cookie in his mouth. I mock you with my sugar cravings.\u201d \u2013 Kit Herondale\u201cHe grinned, and the grin changed his face completely. Ty when he was still and expressionless had an intensity that fascinated Kit; when he was smiling, he was extraordinary.\u201d Kit about TyMark/Cristina and Kieran: Oh my god! I don\u2019t even know how I should put their love triangle into words! I guess first of all I have to say that I\u2019m usually no fan of love triangles and don\u2019t like them because they always seem to be so cheesy and tedious. This time however I wanted them to be together so badly that it almost hurt! XD I can understand why Christina is kind of falling for both of them and even though I initially shipped Mark and Kieran in LM I have to admit that I\u2019m all on the new ship right now! Of all the three of them I somehow loved Kieran the most and therefore truly hope that Mark will be able to forgive him for what he\u2019s done. Since Kieran was taken to the Scholomance at the end of the book I don\u2019t know how their love triangle is going to work out, I certainly hope that I will read a lot of them in the next book though!!! XD\u201cI do not love you as I love Cristina. I love you as I love you,\u201d said Mark. He bent his head. \u201cI wish that you could see my heart. Then you would understand.\u201dI probably could go on and on about all the other awesome couples and their relationships! Dru\u2019s friendship with Jaime, Diana and Gwyn (I loved how Gwyn reacted to her outing!!!), Jace and Clary, Alec and Magnus, they all were so awesome! For the sake of the poor person that actually decided to read through this review I\u2019m going to end it now though! ;-PAll told I relished and loved every single moment of this book and I really, really, really would appreciate it if Cassandra Clare would write just a little bit faster! *LOL*"}, {"userName": "\u2728    jamieson   \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7706640-jamieson", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Beatrice (beatriceinbookland)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41218661-beatrice-beatriceinbookland", "userReview": "\"I thought you loved me.

Break it in pieces. I give you permission.\u201d\n\nI don't recall giving my permission though. I don't recall allowing Cassandra Clare to wreck havoc on my soul and stomp on its pieces before scattering them to the wind. But she did it anyway. \n\n\u201cA dark time is coming for Shadowhunters. A terrible time. Their power will be crushed, their might thrown down into the dirt, and their blood will run like water through the riverbeds of the world.\u201d\n\nBlood, ashes and despair. That's the perfect way to describe Lord of Shadows, with its somber ambience and the unease that keeps creeping up from the pages and sinking into your pores. A war is coming. A war more devastating than ever, since the numbers of the Shadowhunters are alarmingly low and they're torn by inner disputes. There is a rising faction that wishes to strip Downworlders of their rights. To treat them like animals. There is a dangerous book of dark, unholy magic that can unravel the world of the Angel's descendants. There is the Unseelie King who wishes to unite the fairie and destroy everything that stands in his way. A girl raised from the dead, with betrayal in her heart and huge distrust towards the people she can call family. The Blackthorns. It all leads back to them and their allies. Relationships are tested. Unlikely friendships blossom. And two parabatai who love each other more than they should, with a love that threatens to tear their family apart. Can some sacred bonds be broken?\n\n\u201cThere is truth in stories,\u201d said Arthur. \u201cThere is truth in one of your paintings, boy or in a sunset or a couplet from Homer. Fiction is truth, even if it is not a fact. If you believe only in facts and forget stories, your brain will live, but your heart will die.\u201d \n\nThere is always something mystical in the way Cassandra Clare writes. While her writing skills keep improving, the essence of her novels remains the same. In Lord of Shadows, she weaves a story of yearning, passion, bitterness, anger and desire. Desire painted with fevered touches and swollen lips and cheekbones illuminated by moonlight and hearts clenching with unspoken feelings. Her descriptions are lavish, her battle scenes intense, and her characters gloriously flawed. From the land of Fairie and unhallowed churches to Idris and the London Institute that sparked a strong pang of nostalgia she whispered stories of cursed love, of injustice and bloodshed and fanatism. And she triumphantly proved that Arthur Blackthorn could not be wiser: despite the pain and the hopelessness, without fiction our hearts would be dead. \n\n\u201cThose who cannot love do not understand it.\u201d \n\nWhen it comes to Emma Carstairs, Lord of Shadows could easily be renamed into Lady of Bad Decisions. Yes I do admire her fierceness and her strong spirit, her compassion and her sassiness, but by the Angel I lost count of the times she hurt Julian \"for his own good\", when she thought she was self-sacrificing and noble but then mourned her relationship with him when she was the one who broke it. Who broke him. And don't get me started on all those moments when she acted before thinking and ended up endangering everyone close to her. And Julian, well, he also troubled me, especially because he scared me. He was ruthless and cunning for the sake of his family, I can't blame him for that (in fact I love him for that) but if he proceeds with his plan to do you-know-what, I will never forgive him. All this scheming ended up bringing sorrow and huge, fat tears that have not dried yet. \n\n\u201cThere were valuable first editions of books in the enormous library, most of them had been scribbled in by some idiot named Will H.\u201d\n\nAll those references to Will and the Infernal Devices (scones! Jessamine! the Lightwood mansion - I was almost certain the Demon Pox song would make an appearance) were a sweet torture, tiny daggers piercing my heart but also mending it because I somehow felt closer to Will, my favorite character of the Shadowhunters universe. Kit, Livvy, Ty, I loved their scenes and crime-solving attempts, they were such an endearing and bizarre threesome! And speaking of bizarre threesomes, I don't know what to make of the Mark/Cristina/Kieran situation. So many tangled emotions that felt right, despite their oddity, I'm still not certain what I want for them, only more scenes, with unexpected tenderness and craving. \n\n\u201cThe wound is the place where the Light enters you.\u201d\n\nThe wound the ending inflicted though will not be easy to heal, nor does it feel like a source of light. More likely a source of infinite pain. It was cruel, unfair, and absolutely devastating. No dates slaying frost giants, not even Raziel himself dancing salsa will be able to make amends, my dear Cassandra. I'm off to deal with everything the only way I know.You can find this review and more at BookNest.eu!"}, {"userName": "C.G.

If you haven't read Lady Midnight I'd suggest you don't read this :)I have eagerly anticipated this book since I finished Lady Midnight and it honestly didn't let me down what so ever. I had the best two girls to buddy Read with Sailor and Fathima Thank you both for putting up with me! I don't think I could of done this alone!Just a pre-warning, I absolutely love anything Shadowhunter related, they're my favourite type of books and Cassandra Clare is my favourite author, so I will more than likely be gushing away. I don't know what it is, but the characters are SO detailed, and charming it's hard not to love them.I'm going to have to include my favourite quote from the book here, it's too beautiful not to include:\"Do you know why I'm sure? Because when this universe was born, when it blasted into existence in fire and glory, everything that would ever exist was created. Our souls are made of that fire and glory, everything that would ever exist was created. Our souls are made of that fire and glory, of the atoms of it, the fragments of stars. Everyone's are, but I believe ours, yours and mine, are made from the dust of the same star. That's why we've been drawn to each other like magnets, all our lives. All the pieces of us belong together.\" - Julian BlackthornComing into this, I'd kind of prepared myself for my heart to just break over and over, what I didn't expect was to cry so much at the teeny tiny little things! My heart broke for Julian and Emma, the whole family, Christina and Kieran. These characters are just so close to my heart! The character development in this book was just outstanding.\"They stood in a line: the Shadowhunters, the warlock and the faerie prince.\"\"The way I love you is fundamental to me, Emma. It's who I am. No matter how far we are from each other.\" - Julian BlackthornWhere do I even begin with Emma and Julian? During my buddy reads, this was brought up so much! Do you know when you want a pair to be together so much, but it jus doesn't look like it's ever going to happen? Here we have it! We'll alway be parabatai, Emma. It's for life. - Julian Blackthorn What makes them special is that they're both quite strong characters, but for completely different reasons. All I want to do is gush about how lovable Julian is. I mean come on, this guy will do anything, literally anything to protect his family. Even in his darkest times he always puts others before himself. What really moves me about Julian is that even though he is hurting he wants to put others happiness before his own. My heart hasn't broken this much over a character since my love Will Herondale. Emma on the other hand, at times I just wanted to shake her and to confess all to not only Julian but to Mark as well! I understand where she is coming from, but you know! Anyway other than that, I'm looking forward to her character development for The Queen of Air and Darkness. I mean come on, for those who have read this, we know! \"In Faerie, I would challenge Rosales to a duel for this, he broke his promise, and a love-promise at that. He would meet me in combat if Cristina consented to let me be her champion.\" - Mark BlackthornEven now I'm still very very confused with Mark, Cristina and Kieran. Now don't get me wrong, I love them all, but what on earth is happening?! Do they all like each other, is it going to be just two of them together in the end? I DON'T KNOW! What I do know is that I actually really, really, really enjoyed all three of these characters throughout. What I like so much, is that they all contrast from each other and it's all very odd, but so good! We have Cristina who is just a nice girl trying to do what's right. What I really liked is that we got to see her inner child, especially when it comes to Faeries. Something Cristina said was so beautiful I had to include it, so here it is: \"Love is as strong as death. I believe that.\" Mark who is such a lovable odd person you can't ever be mad at him. I mean come on! Just the things he says, and how he acts, but doesn't understand why they may be odd to others. Then we have Kieran, the Faerie who gives off the impression he is superior to all, but really just wants to be loved and accepted. It's hard to keep up with these three but they all brought something different. My highlight for Kieran was 100% him bowing and winking when he was called a traitor, it was glorious. I think the dancing scene was so special, and so unique I was just sat there like is this really happening? It was just so perfect! I can't wait to read more!There's nobody else I'd rather be like than you, I Want you to be proud of me.\" - Livvy BlackthornLivvy, Sherlock and Watson Ty and Kit once again, I have no idea what so ever what is going on with this trio. I just loved the friendship/relationship which was built between these. I think in this book in particularly you could see them developing into their shadowhunting roles and I honestly found it so enjoyable. (Did anyone notice that when Kit held the Serpah blade, it seemed to glow brighter and brighter, or is this just me). I am beyond curious to find out what is going on with Ty and Kit, are they just very close friends orrrrr?! I love how they're all so close, and if one's in danger the others come to each others aid to help each other out. Seriously though, the standout for me was definitely the promising friendship of Ty and Kit AKA, Watson and Sherlock! Kit is just so understanding, can I put him in my pocket please?But he knew he could reassure her. He wasn't leaving the Shadowhunters. He wasn't going anywhere. Because where the Blackthorns were, was his home now.Diana and Gwyn. I think I may have a slight soft spot for Gwyn. Don't ask me why, I couldn't tell you, but I do! This pair are SO good together, I mean they help each other out, they respect one another. Gwyn is so understanding and doesn't even seem to bat an eye. I really really loved Diana opening up to Gwyn, and that made me respect these two so much more. I LOVE THEM OKAY!They wanted their revenge, The Council. They didn't see how revenge begets more revenge. \"For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind\"\" - Magnus Bane We got more of Magnus and Alec wooooo! Most people love Magnus, and I'm no exception. I was so happy how involved these two were in the book, I liked the glimpses we got into their life now, how they've developed and the children are so damn cute!Finally, I'm hoping we see more of Dru, you know who and Tavvy in the final series of the book, we get glimpses into them, but I really want more...I have conflicting views about The Centurions, lets be honest Zara is a complete bitch, as his her following. But I think that there's going to be more to it with the others. I'm intrigued to find out more and find out more about Perfect DiegoThis part was going into the bits I liked but I think it needs a special mention. Can I just say how HAPPY I am that there were so many connections to previous books, and a lot of that was for The Infernal Devices! When I say this, I mean it. I literally cried of happiness. We got so many beautiful moments.There were valuable first editions of books in the enormous library, most of them had been scribbled in by some idiot named Will H. Photographs of them all together, Jessamine popping up. I-A-M-R-U-I-N-E-D. Not only that but we had Bridget as well! I was hoping for her morbid tunes, instead we got a hilarious line: \"The Herondales have always been famous for their good looks, but if you ask me, the Lightwoods are the more sexually charismatic of the bunch.\"What I liked ahm loved- Mark wanting to be Cristinas champion, I was crying with laughter. I don't know why, it honestly really made me laugh.- I really enjoyed that we got to see something from Arthurs point of view, I think he's such an interesting character and was quite surprised we got a glance of something from him. P.S - \"Tell Julian thank you\" - Arthur Blackthorn MY HEART! Not only that, but when he protected Ty and Livvy, it was such a proud moment. - Chapter 11 was very very veryyyyyy good- The development of Kit and him coming to terms he's a Shadowhunter, not just a Shadowhunter but a Herondale. When he took up the Serpah for first time I was like YASSSS! Then an Iratze YASSSSS AGAIN!- The trades the four make to get into the Courts, I liked the fact they each gave something, and they were also told something in return. Each one of these were so perfect!- All of the secrets. There's so many questions I want answering.- Ty in the Shadow Market gave me life! I was cheering him on!- The way in which something is told is so heartbreaking, I don't want to go into too much detail because of spoilers... but I just think it was handled very well. - THE RIDERS! I'm intrigued okay...- THAT LETTER! I was in tears, it was so special and so beautiful. Broke me. What didn't I like?- The only thing that I don't like is the length of the chapters (for anyone that noticed and read my updates) I can't stop part way through a chapter, and these are sooooooo long!- Out of 29 chapters, there was only (for me personally) one chapter that seemed to be nonsense and not a lot really happened. - I really wanted more Jem and Tessa!WHO IS ASH?! Me and Sailor think he's \"the weapon\" for The Queen of Air and Darkness The excitement is real!Why do we have to wait TWO years! That ending ripped my heart out and just was like, see you in two years!\"After all, when you are dying of thirst, it was the sip of water you dreamed about, not the whole reservoir.\"P.S - I don't think I'll ever be okay with that ending. Heartbroken.\"I never thought what we had could break so easily.\" - Julian BlackthornPre thoughts belowNOT LONG TO GO AND A PAGE HAS BEEN RELEASED!

Meaning I liked it, didn't love it like everyone else in the world! Damn it all!I was pretty excited for this book to come out. The love triangles in the books get on my nerves so I wasn't drop everything and lets read it now. I just wanted to get through it at one point. I love Kit's character. I think he's funny and coming into his own at being a Shadowhunter. I loved that Jace and Clary made another appearance, but I'm worried at one of the things that was told in confidence about a death. It just about broke my heart and I'm wondering if that will come up in the next book a million years from now. There is something dreadful that happened at the end of the book and I don't even know what to say. It's sad, okay?I just wish that Emma and Mark could be together. That's who I WANT! I'm tired of reading about Kieran, Mark and Christina. I love all three characters but I want to see Kieran with Christina because the times they were together there seemed to be something there. Something almost sexy and hidden. Emma and Julian, I just don't. I love Julian for all he does for the family but I just don't find him as a person that stokes my fire. <-- yeah, I said that. I love the things that Kit, Ty and Livvy got up to together with the exception of the bad things. I hated that Centurion, Zara, with a passion. I wanted to drop kick her off the roof. The Centurion's had a plan set up and it wasn't a good plan. Not all wanted to go along with it so there's that. Arthur is still nuts but he did some cool things and you just have to love him no matter what. Diana was awesome and stepped up and put that Zara in her place and did whatever she could to save the kids. Magnus and Alec made an appearance as well. I always love Magnus so he can make an appearance at all times =) There's a little bit of fighting and things that need to be taken care of and some evilness, but I felt like it was more about all of these people and their triangles. I just don't know. Maybe I will read both books over again when the other one comes out in a million years from now. I'm still really sad about that ending. I thought it was going to be a different sad ending but it wasn't and it took me by surprise and it's not a good thing =( and we have a Sigh. . .MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "Amber Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30813900-amber-robertson", "userReview": "BUDDY READING with my Julian aka CaitlinI want to die. Everything hurts. I can't breathe. The world is over and I have to wait two years. My soul burns. I honestly didn't expect this. This book is a blessing and my hell. Someone save me. Cassandra Clare is my queen and has quite literally ripped my heart out of my body and stomped all over it. My lactose intolerance doesn't agree with this book either; I ate two blocks of chocolate stressing out and now I'm banning myself from buying chocolate because boy do I want to cry some more.

Splayed her fingers over his heart. It beat against her palm, like a fist punching its way through his sternum. \u201cBreak my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cBreak it in pieces. I give you permission.\u201d\u201d\n The hardest part of reading this book is you have to put up with an emotional influx, from what Clare always tangles the love of the main characters like Jace and Clary, or Jem and Tessa and Will, I am certain that Julian and Emma will break you even more like no one can. Lord of Shadows represents a continuation after what happened in Lady Midnight. The plot was developed. The characters grow up. The villains show theirs other sides appealing for our sympathy, yet Cassandra Clare put this together impeccably.\n\u201cEveryone is afraid of something. We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.\u201d \nJulian is my beloved character since City of Heavenly Fire. I could see that his heart was so pure then, and his love for Emma is larger than life. My heart literally and figuratively broke for him when he longs for something he's not supposed to have. Emma, on the other hand, is a great and strong female character. She complements the good sides of Julian, while he gradually unravels his dark side to us in this book. The contrast is surreal and makes this book more intriguing than I thought.\n\u201cEmma. I need you, always, always think about you, I was wishing you were with me in that goddamned attic and then I turned around and you were there, like you heard me, like you're always there when I need you ...\u201d\n The main plot is moving forward with the slow pace. To be honest, it took me almost a week to finish this book for some parts were boring and some were not. Not like Lady Midnight, Lord of Shadows doesn't have the mysterious atmosphere or thrilling investigation that I fell in love with. I really missed that excitement when I first read Lady Midnight while reading this book, and I hoped that the ending would save it all, but um, I thought I was wrong. The ending was so cruel and left a major impact on me, though. How could you, Clare ? How could you do this to me ? I'd prepared for anything, ANYTHING. But this ? This is too much. Shockingly I had to stop reading for a while since it hurt me so much to continue even though there were just two or three pages left. \n\u201cThere's never going to be anyone else for me. That's just how it is.\u201d\n Well, I kinda like how the author wrote about Bangkok institute and transgender. In Bangkok, transgender or ladyboys are very famous, and when I saw this, I was so surprised because yeah ! this is my country and she detailed it pretty good. However, this series has the variety of sexuality from straight, gay, bi to pansexual. And this makes me love Clare even more. I love LGBTQ in novels. They should be paid attention to both in books and real life.About Ty and Kit, I think I saw something passing between them.I am so afraid to read this. Not because someone I love might die, but the next and the last book will be released in 2019.TWO YEARS !\n\u201cSometimes the most ruthless heart speaks the most truth\u201d \nhttps://goo.gl/C35G5Y"}, {"userName": "Frankie Lovely", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61971658-frankie-lovely", "userReview": "5 stars*UPDATE 6/18/17 - NEW added song suggestions at the bottom of review>>>>>>>I have no words right now ...

Lord of Shadows was one of my most-anticipated releases of 2017 and i was worried. aside from the obvious fact of PAIN and WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY FAVES, i was afraid this installment would disappoint me. the more i read and review novels, the more critical and cynical i get. i rarely enjoy books for the sake of it unless there are low expectations. but with Lord of Shadows, i couldn\u2019t help but have high expectations. thankfully, cassandra clare left me feeling happily horrible. it had all the emotional pain and frustration i expected \u2013 and more! buuuut there were a few things i was feeling :// about. this bible-sized novel was slower than anticipated. i remember flying through Lady Midnight despite its size; i can't say the same for LoS. i'm not saying i couldn't bring myself to finish, but there were parts when i thought CAN WE MOVE ON. there were also parts when i anticipated things before it happened. i'm not sure if clare intentionally made things somewhat predictable orrrr if i'm getting better at guessing things. either way, i was kinda sad/frustrated about that.\n\u201cEveryone is afraid of something. We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.\u201d\naside from these two tiny things, LORD OF SHADOWS WAS AMAZING. it left me feeling wrecked and emotionally unstable. i know some may hesitate on picking this up due to its size, but it's worth every page. i'd highly highly recommend to anyone who likes reading. as someone who wasn't a fan of cassandra clare from the start, i must admit: her work continues to improve and grow beyond my expectations. GO READ IT. SPOILER-FILLED DISCUSSION BEGINNING. don't say i didn't warn you... *side eye* if you haven't read this book, please please stop here. you DON'T want to be spoiled.  characters & relationships let's talk about these characters and such first, shall we? ten pages into the book and MARK AND EMMA ARE A THING. i'm feeling every kind of betrayal. i'm screaming my head off. however, it becomes quickly clear that those two are not going to work out (romantically) and the world is right again. (yes, i'm gonna be THAT petty about them.) we all knew they weren't going to get anything more than a platonic relationship. meanwhile, my poor jules is SUFFERING i'm mostly just glad jules and emma are back together-ish?? the truth is out and that's all that matters. sorta.moving onto the new unholy trinity: ty, livvy, and kit. these three!! are so gold!!! kit starts off as someone who is NOT having it and tries to deny everything about being a shadowhunter. ty and livvy eventually grow on him and he becomes part of their crew\u2122. THEY ARE MY FAVES. FAVES. FAVES. i kinda ship ty and kit very much and i find it hilarious that livvy kissed kit. the love between these three are so wonderful. until livvy.... I HAVE WORDS ON THIS LATERthe mark/cristina/kieran triangle thing is strange. (diego is not part of this because it DOES NOT EVEN COUNT.) this triangle can go three ways but i'm ultimately rooting for mark and cristina as a romantic relationship. i'm surprised by how much i love cristina and kieran as friends. I JUST LOVE CRISTINA.now for the other relationships: gwyn and diana? LOVE THEM. they are hilarious and adorable. gwyn was so unexpected and I LOVE HIM. also i LOVE how we found out more on diana\u2019s past and who she really is! i was sososososo surprised the thing leading up to her secret was that she\u2019s transgender. (more on this later) dru and jamie have this thing going on and i don't know how to feel about it. :/ in general, the blackthorns are my favorite family and everyone is wonderful. i love the way their family mends together.  plot????! can we have an in-depth rant about zara and her bigotry gang? they need to GET OUT. as if we don't get enough of this in real life (at least in america right now), it's going on in the shadowhunter world too. WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE MORE RELEVANT. it all started when her annoying ass barged into the LA Institute with her stupid pin, asking the blackthorns to do her laundry. she started off as someone who was simply ANNOYING but eventually became a larger threat. i feel like that's such a strong metaphor for trump's america. it made me realize how politics in the shadowhunter world are very similar to the united states right now. i see downworlders/shadowhunters/faeries/etc as a metaphor for race. the dearborns and the rest of the gang are basically petitioning for extermination and containment of downworlders (aka POC in the real world). i don\u2019t know about you but doesn\u2019t that sound a little familiar???????? people of the lgbtq+ community aren\u2019t entirely accepted in the shadowhunter world, even though there are many who do support them. unfortunately, i think the same could be said for the world right now. it\u2019s weird how i saw these things more clearly after reading LoS \u2013 a story set in a fictional world. even though it\u2019s not \u201creal\u201d and the issues are more exaggerated, i think it\u2019s more prominent because I FEEL SO MUCH FOR THESE CHARACTERS. it\u2019s a personal attack on them, which makes it a personal attack on me. it feels real to me \u2013 even more so than the \u201creal world.\u201d (i think that shows how UTTERLY BIZARRE american politics are right not because it feels like a poorly written fictional story than Real Things!)anyway, enough of that. i'm just going to get more upset if i think about it. MOVING ON. i was super wary during their trip to the unseelie and seelie courts because FAERIES AND THEIR TRICKERY. it was a hot mess, but i expected worse so *whew.* the part that had me screaming in frustration was when emma was unable to kill the faerie because he looked like her dad. :((( the one good thing that came out of that trip was julian finding out how to break the parabatai bond.SO. the parabatai bond. it can be broken but it\u2019ll also break all parabatai bonds. this was another ASDJGYFHKLJH,K;WHAT moment. (and also robert is dead so someone HELP) i didn\u2019t realize the strength of cortana and how important it was when emma killed one of the riders of mannanan. it happened and i was like, \u201coh, okay, moving on.\u201d BUT THEN, turns out it\u2019s a big deal and now the riders are probably going after emma in the future. i\u2019m curious (and scared but also not because it\u2019s EMMA) to see how that\u2019ll come to play in the next book.annabel blackthorn is a nutcase and should be dead. AGAIN. even though malcom died, i had a theory he\u2019d be back \u2013 and he did come back, only to die on by the hand of his lover. (go annabel!) after julian talked to her, i was a little more trusting. maybe she wasn\u2019t that insane. BUT THEN. she goes ham and kills robert lightwood and livvy blackthorn. in her defense, she might\u2019ve been triggered by the mortal sword and gone to a bad place. BUT STILL. i\u2019ll never forgive her or trust her again.  ENDING???!?!!! that being said, LIVVY. yeah, robert\u2019s death was sad but more importantly\u2026 LIVVY. i kid you not, i read the sentence \u2013 \u201c... she was truly beautiful, a Shadowhunter in full flowering glory, just before she landed lightly on the wooden floor dias\u2019s edge and drove her jagged, broken half blade into Livvy\u2019s heart.\u201d \u2013 and shut the book. i let out the longest gasp and could not believe it because this is not happening this is not happening thisisnothappening. the stages of grief are true. it started with pure and utter shock, turned to despair (crying for a good 30 min), and now i\u2019m at denial. even though the last sentence confirms it because the clock chimed and livvy was just talking about that clock. BUT. but. robert lightwood also died and i\u2019m hoping it was chiming for robert. (the cliffhanger of LM was a misunderstanding so this could be too???)

Welll, good for you, I like to give surprises and make everyone\u2019s day a thousand times better. (today the sarcasm game is strong. Verrry strong :) :))Anyway this book was a fucking rollercoaster of emotions (aka the rollercoaster of death)I cried.I laughed.I shrieked and screamed. Because of my screaming, my lil bro fell off the bed while sleeping. #GoodTimes (he did break my keyboard so\u2026 back at ya)Anyway this review is going to be in a different format. It\u2019s going to be full of spoilers so proceed with caution! I am not fully adding that big spoiler tag since the pre-review is my hilarious self and you should obviously read it if you haven\u2019t read the book. (I mean, you can read the pre-review even if you have read the book)I find myself utterly and completely hilarious so like, yeah.So for this book I won\u2019t do the likes and dislikes thing because literally IT WAS PERFECTION! I will just talk about the events and the overall feelings towards all of them as the book progressed.\u2022We start the book with Kit\u2019s POV. This! Guy! Is! Actually! Going! To! Be! The! Death! Of! Me! I think Kit is my favourite character along with Livvy and Ty because god forbid how the fuck can I forget the twins? \u2022Kit stealing weapons and being caught by Jace is my new aesthetic.\u2022I loved how Jace came and talked with him because they are the only two Herondales left? Brrrb,,, I am not crying, it\u2019s you.\u2022The book is so action packed like??? I loved that scene in the start where they killed the Teuthilda demon at the pier.\u2022RIP Magnus the fish\u2022Mark is also going to be the death of me\u2022I still don\u2019t like Cristina :) :)\u2022I was excited at first when it was mentioned that the Centurions were going to live in the institute as I thought we\u2019ll meet some hot and sexy new Shadowhunters but damn it was I wrong.\u2022I liked Manuel in the start but damn it was I wrong. (He\u2019s such a lying piece of utter SHIT)\u2022Zara is a motherfucking bitch you piece of shit just fuck off.\u2022I hate how Clary and Jace talk to Mark about Kieran. Everything in Mark and Kieran\u2019s relationship is super super complex and I will talk about all that later, but seriously? I was super uncomfortable when they came to Mark for information.\u2022The scene at the Shadow Market. I AM ACTUALLY CRYING KIT OH MY GOD.\u2022When Kit talked to Julian about Ty being autistic, I was so happy. I love how Kit is like, \u2018Ty is autistic, so what?\u2019 THIS IS THE REP YOU NEED.\u2022\u2018I defy you, Shadowhunters, he thought, thumbing the top of the container and popping a cookie in his mouth. I mock you with my sugar cravings.\u2019\u2022Kit is my favourite for a reason.\u2022Ty and Kit talk about cookies. JUST KISS ALREADY YOU IDIOTS.\u2022Ty gave Kit his first rune. Let me die in peace.\u2022Livvy and Ty accept Kit into their group. *sobs for eternity*\u2022What right do the Centurions and Zara have for treating the Blackthorns like trash? None. \u2022Dru is pretty much nonexistent in the first half. We do get her POV at like the 75% mark, but I wanted to see more of her.\u2022Kit now has the Herondale family ring which belonged to James Herondale. #throwbackthursday \u2022I had heard so many ridiculous reasons as to why Clary refuses to marry Jace but when it was revealed I did feel bad for her even though I dislike both Clary and Jace and I don\u2019t ship Clace.\u2022When Cristina and Diego broke up I was happy since Cristina should know that being happy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re with a guy. BUT, that allll changes later on because no one can stay single for more than two weeks!!! Damn sexy Shadowhunters and their extremely good looking genes. \u2022The ship which I shipped (Mark and Emma) sank before it even began sailing. RIP. I do like their friendship tho.\u2022Am I the only one who doesn\u2019t find Emma and her jokes funny? I don\u2019t even like Emma anymore. Everything about her screams trying too hard.\u2022I think this is a problem with all of Cassie\u2019s protagonists. I dislike both Emma and Clary and my hate for Tessa knows no bounds. They all just try too hard, pfft.\u2022But I do have to commend her on her secondary characters. They somehow make up for the protagonists.\u2022\u2018Livvy gave Kit a thumbs-up. \u201cYou absolutely could have been rejected from the yearly Hot Shadowhunters Calendar.\u201d\u201cRejected?\u201d Kit demanded as they started downstairs.Her eyes were dancing. \u201cFor being too young, of course.\u201d\u201cThere is no Hot Shadowhunters Calendar,\u201d said Ty.\u2019\u2022Omg I love their group so much. <3\u2022Kit\u2019s list about the things he doesn\u2019t like about the Shadowhunters ahhhh. He\u2019s such a dork. (he\u2019s also Ty\u2019s Watson <3) Be still my beating heart. \u2022ZARA IS THE BIGGEST BITCH AND MANUEL YOU ASSHOLE.\u2022STOP SAYING ALL THIS ABOUT MY BLACKTHORNS.\u2022When they went to Faerieland was easily the best part of the book for me. It was all so aesthetic asfjhkgjl jsghfsjkfjtkbfeukv ekyu5kytievukrktvghnesri ui7uy6n5 bhiftguophbnjkhgf nbjgsn gfsy8rt69\u2022Now comes the angry rant. I absofuckinlutely DO NOT ship Marktina. Why can\u2019t these goddamned Shadowhunters STOP KISSING?\u2022I DESPISE THIS LOVE TRIANGLE SO MUCH OMG.\u2022So we get to the part where they rescue Kieran and make a deal with the Seelie Queen and stuff. I HATE how they were using Kieran. I don\u2019t like Mark anymore because of this. Yes, what Kieran did was indeed wrong, but it happened accidentally. Kieran has never really known the love of family. We could see all that when we saw the Unseelie King and his brothers. They just do not care about him. He just wanted Mark back because Mark was the only one who showed kindness towards him and truly loved him. You know how tough it is when the only person who loves you is not with you anymore? You obviously try your best to bring that person back. I feel like Kieran is the most misunderstood character ever. He did make a mistake but he tried to correct it when Iarlath came to whip Mark. He thought that they\u2019ll just bring Mark back and that would be the end of it. He did try to avert the situation. And it was because of him that they could reach to Malcolm in time. He has done a lot to rectify his mistake but people still treat him like trash. I don\u2019t actually comprehend this. One thing that was extremely triggering to me was when Emma called him \u2018Weasel Face\u2019. She should have had atleast a little bit of more respect for him because he was helping them in their mission. I am fiercely protective of Kieran and I hate how everyone treats him. I hate how Mark acted when Kieran was kissing him in the London Institute. I hate all of this. I hate that Mark isn\u2019t that good of a character and sassy anymore because he is now so hung up on Cristina. I feel really bad for Kieran. He\u2019s been through a lot, just give him a break. He doesn\u2019t deserve all of your betrayals and shit. I am going to sink with my ship Kierark. Literally fight me. \u2022Now, let\u2019s talk about our dear Cristina. She is legit even more perfect\u2122 than Diego. She is always kind towards everyone. She always understands everyone. She never gets angry. She never loses her temper. She doesn\u2019t get jealous. WOMAN GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK! She is so perfect my eyes literally hurt from rolling them.\u2022If Kieran falls in love with her I am slapping him so hard.\u2022And I also think that Mark, Kieran and Cristina will be in a poly relationship. You know why? Cassie hints over and over again that she loves love triangles and poly relationships and she says that these three don\u2019t get jealous of each other. I swear to god if this happens I am burning these books.\u2022I don\u2019t understand why there has to be a shit load of love triangles. Stop. This isn\u2019t even a love triangle anymore. It\u2019s just a complex septagon or something. (my English teacher once said septagon as sexagon\u2026 so lol)\u2022I\u2019m really intrigued to see more of the Riders! I don\u2019t understand how Emma can kill one of them. Sure, she has Cortana but I don\u2019t buy it.\u2022Diana\u2019s backstory was easily the best thing in the entire book. I didn\u2019t really like her in the first book as she seemed so very shady to me but in LOS I could see how much she cared for the Blackthorns. I just want her to be happy :)\u2022CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW AMAZING AND INTELLIGENT TIBERIUS BLACKTHORN AKA THE LOVE OF MY LIFE IS? ANYWAY I LOVE HIM SO MUCH MY HEAD HURTS HE IS SO PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS. He discovered that letter place and sent Annabel that letter (which made me really emotional tbh) and because of him Annabel agreed to testify. I just want him to have a happy ending with Kit. :) :) \u2022Livia Blackthorn is the sass queen and I am crying because Kit was her first and last kiss. :((((((\u2022All the little tidbits about TID and TLH made me so happy and excited. 2018 cannot come faster. I need Chain of Gold in my hands right now.\u2022OH and Ty also gave Kit his Voyance rune. I\u2019m not crying, it\u2019s you.\u2022Jessamine was back! I loved to see her. I feel like Kieran she is also quite underappreciated and misunderstood.\u2022Jessamine has a crush on Julian!!!!! XD\u2022Have you noticed Jessamine\u2019s character development? In TID she says Will is a terrible Welshman and SHE IS NOW PROTECTING HIS BOOKS LIKE?? This is the quality character development I signed up for.\u2022DID YOU GUYS READ THE SCENE WHERE KIT HUGS TY???OMGJGKFDUVBNFNHBTMJTKJDSMVB HG.LKJNMH;ULOITTDF\u2019UMBK BNJJNHB KDLGNJNIUYJM TM9JYM UBTODPJNTY;OUHDGRTHIT5U497865UYHTYIOLU \u2022Put your arms around me,\u201d said Ty. His hands were pale blurs in the air, as if Kit were looking at a time-lapse photo. \u201cHold on to me.\u201dHe was still rocking. After a moment, Kit put his arms around Ty, not quite knowing what else to do. It was like holding a loosed arrow: Ty felt hot and sharp in his arms, and he was vibrating with some strange emotion. After what felt like a long time he relaxed slightly. His hands touched Kit, their motion slowing, his fingers winding themselves into Kit\u2019s sweater.\u201cTighter,\u201d Ty said. He was hanging on to Kit as if he were a life raft, his forehead digging painfully into Kit\u2019s shoulder. He sounded desperate. \u201cI need to feel it.\u201dKit had never been a casual hugger, and no one had ever, that he could remember, come to him for comforting. He wasn\u2019t a comforting sort of person. He\u2019d always assumed that. And he barely knew Ty.But then, Ty didn\u2019t do things for no reason, even if people whose brains were differently wired couldn\u2019t see his reasons immediately. Kit remembered the way Livvy rubbed Ty\u2019s hands tightly when he was stressed and thought: The pressure is a sensation; the sensation must be grounding. Calming. That made sense. So Kit found himself holding Ty harder, until Ty relaxed under the tight grip of his hands; held him more tightly than he\u2019d ever held anyone, held him as if they\u2019d been lost in the sea of the sky, and only holding on to each other could keep them afloat above the wreckage of London.\u2022BABY THIS IS WHAT YOU CAME FOR\u2022Can you say holy shit faster\u2022Ok now we come to the last 20 pages where everything goes to absolute shit. LIVVY OH MY GOD SHE DID NOT DESERVE THAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO TY NOW???\u2022The last thing I needed was Julian to cry over Livvy\u2019s dead body telling her to look at him one last time.\u2022while we\u2019re talking about Julian, I have to say that I don\u2019t like him anymore. I hate the type of guys who get so hung up because of love and stuff and Julian was exactly like that. He just wasn\u2019t the same anymore, and I hate Emma and his romance so excuse me.\u2022OH ALSO let\u2019s talk about Max and Kieran! Their scenes were so cute ashajfkltdielyor\u2022Arthur Blackthorn is also one character that is super super super underappreciated.\u2022I loved Dru and Jaime's frenship. I may or may not ship them. #sorrynotsorry\u2022WHO WAS THAT KID WHEN DRU ACCIDENTALLY WENT TO FAERIE? I THINK HE IS THE SEELIE QUEEN AND SEBASTIAN'S SON BECAUSE BLOND HAIR AND GREEN EYES. also time moves differently in Faerie, so i am maybe correct.Overall Thoughts- Look. This is the best Shadowhunter book till date. I did have my issues, yes, but I still love the Shadowhunter books with all of my heart.___________________LITERALLY FUCK THIS BOOKFUCK EVERYONEFUCK YOU_____________________ EDIT- May 17' FEEELS y'all. i was just going to sleep yesterday when i went on Cassie's tumblr to see that the first 50 have been released. asgjksdfgktfhjboi tjnmifo hsdgdbrghydnrjjkndvlxnihyuinyihtlvldthr i bet you couldn't say heck yes faster you can read them here!and now you know what i was doing staying up till midnight EDIT- May 16' FEEEELS I swear to god this is not the only book I think about okay??

EDIT- April 29' 2017 FEEELS I woke up and saw that Cassie released this snippet. Read it. read it.   They said that men joined the Wild Hunt sometimes when they had sustained a great loss, preferring to howl out their grief to the skies than to suffer in silence in their ordinary gray lives. Emma remembered soaring through the sky with Mark, his arms around her waist: She had let the wind take her screams of excitement, thrilling to the freedom of the sky where there was no pain, no worry, only forgetfulness.And here was Mark, beautiful in that way that the night sky was beautiful, offering her that same freedom with an outstretched hand. What if I could love Mark? she thought. What if I could make this lie true?Then it would be no lie. If she could love Mark, it would end all the danger. Julian would be safe.She had nodded. Reached her hand out to Mark\u2019s.  COME ON. FUCKING SCREAM WITH ME. THERE ARE STILL 3 WEEKS LEFT FOR THIS TO COME OUT AND I THOUGHT I WOULD CALMLY WAIT UNTIL THEN AND WORK ON MY ASSIGNMENTS AND COMING TESTS??? NOW WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO????

I do not think they are perfect matches. They are such great characters seperately so strong but I dont think they fit together romantically...For some reason I think Christina is a better match for Julian. I love the parbaitai bond between them and how they make a great team but friendship is where it ends.

Beautiful things, cruel things, cruel in that way that only people who absolutely believed in the rightness of their cause could be cruel. \nI\u2019ve been a massive fan of the Shadowhunters books for almost half of my life. I read TMI\u2014the original trilogy\u2014about nine years ago, and have followed each new release since with great anticipation. (I have a vivid memory of bringing a copy of City of Bones\u2014you know, that old cover that had Jace\u2019s shirtless chest on it\u2014to the beach one day, and my friend\u2019s mom thinking it was erotica and telling me that she didn\u2019t think that book looked like it was appropriate for me.) I know there are some people who don\u2019t particularly like the fact that CC has continued to write in this universe, but I personally love it. It\u2019s incredible how richly developed and complex the characters and settings become with each book. The Dark Artifices is exploring so many new parts of the Shadowhunter world, and I loved how its plot intertwines with both new and familiar places and characters.First of all, I just want to address why this wasn\u2019t a five-star read for me.As much as I loved Lord of Shadows, I\u2019m docking one star because the pacing and plot were kinda all over the place. (Honestly, if I didn\u2019t already have so much established love for these characters and this world, my rating would probably be closer to 3.5 stars.) It took me a while to really get into the story. Not much seemed to happen for the first third of the book, and the plot was still meandering somewhat aimlessly until the last third AKA when everyone finally got all their shit on the same page and started making sense. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoyed the entire book because these characters are pretty much my life and I could\u2014usually\u2014happily read about them doing anything. BUT I did feel like the beginning of the book was way too focused on catching up on all the characters\u2019 feelings and emotional drama. It took me almost two weeks to read this, which is probably a record for me when it comes to Cassandra Clare books, and I kept putting it down because of the frustrating plotlessness of the first half.Now that I\u2019ve got that off my chest, let\u2019s talk about what I did love.***the rest of this review will contain some minor spoilers***TDA has one of the largest casts of main characters I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s been over a year since I read Lady Midnight, so I struggled a bit at first to keep the names of all the Blackthorn kids straight, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. It\u2019s incredible that despite there being roughly 9 main characters (I\u2019m counting Emma, Cristina, Kieran, and all the Blackthorns excluding Tavvy because he\u2019s too small to count as a real human yet), each person has a well-developed and individual personality. I genuinely loved all of them, which is something I can rarely say about a book. There\u2019s also just so much love between all of the characters and my heart breaks for how much they already have and will continue to sacrifice for each other.As fantastic as each character is, though, there were definitely a few who really stood out in this book.Mark was my favorite, which surprised me because I didn\u2019t remember loving him quite this much in the first book. He\u2019s just such a genuinely good person, but he\u2019s really struggling to figure out where he fits into the Shadowhunter and Faerie worlds. He's trying so hard to be a normal human but he's awkward sometimes (and if that isn\u2019t relatable AF idk what is). Mark has been through so much and faced so much hatred but he still genuinely cares about people and the world and ugh my heart breaks for this boy. One of my absolute favorite parts of this book was Diana\u2019s plotline. This is a non-spoilery review so I won\u2019t go into too many details, but it was heartbreaking to hear about the struggles she\u2019d faced to truly be herself, and how the Clave still blocked her from helping the people she loved. It made my heart so happy that she found someone who she could share her story with, and I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing more of her in the next book.Ty is such a fantastically written and important character. He\u2019s a fifteen-year-old who\u2019s grown up autistic in a world that has little understanding of mental disabilities, and yet he is never presented as anything less than a strong, intelligent, and capable Shadowhunter. The way Kit and Livvy and the rest of the family help him to work around some of the challenges he faces is so kind and considerate and made me cry a couple of times. Kids\u2014and adult\u2014like Ty deserve to be able to read about characters like them, characters who may experience the world differently than most people but are no less capable. Additionally, people who may not have encountered autistic people in their lives also need to read about these characters. Whether we are conscious of it or not, representation influences the way we interact with and understand people who are different from us, and that\u2019s why good representation is so important. It makes all of us better more empathetic humans.Moving on to the relationships in this book\u2026\u2026To sum it up, they\u2019re a hot fucking mess. I cannot remember ever reading a book with such tangled romantic relationships between so many different characters. There aren\u2019t really love triangles, there aren't even any kind of recognizable geometric shapes. I'm honestly so stressed about this because I just want all of these amazing characters to be happy but ???? I have absolutely no clue how any of this is going to work out and it\u2019s low-key terrifying.Emma and Julian destroy me, like they care about each other so much and the fact that they can't be together is hurting both of them and I just wanna cry for them because they deserve to be happy with each other and it seems like there is genuinely no solution?? Also Ty and Kit !!!! I know it hasn\u2019t really happened yet so for now they just have a cute friendship but knowing that\u2019s where it\u2019s going and that we\u2019re gonna get more books about them is so exciting!!! And then Mark and Kieran and Cristina have this weird thing where I feel like they all kinda like each other so who tf knows where that\u2019s going, I\u2019d be down for them to have a threesome tho.There were also some wonderful friendships in this book! I love how much Emma and Cristina support each other and help each other through hard times and difficult decisions, and the Ty/Kit/Livvy squad was friendship goals.I absolutely love the fact that the TMI and TID characters appear in this series as well\u2026\u2026.but it\u2019s also really scary because if anything happens to my favs I don't even know what I'll do. (Side note: how fucking adorable are Alec and Magnus and their kids I just want them to live a happy life together)Anyway, although the characters and ships were amazing, one of the most powerful aspects of this book for me was its message.I had mixed feelings about Zara as a character when she was introduced. I was frustrated by her at first because she seemed to have been thrown in to fulfill the archetypal role of the bitchy popular girl, but as we got to know her it became clear that she was much more\u2014and much worse\u2014than that. It was incredibly difficult to read about her, because there are unfortunately many people like her who exist in this world: people who spew hatred and prejudice and rhetoric that urges listeners to resist social progress, hearkening back to a so-called age of former glory that never truly existed. It can be easy to disregard them at first, to dismiss these people as simply a fringe group of radicals who won\u2019t actually manage to do anything with their ideas, but this book shows just how far a group like that can rise if they are allowed to continue unchecked. Zara Dearborn (read as: Tomi Lahren's long-lost twin), her father, and their band of followers are dangerous.Cristina (I\u2019m pretty sure this quote was her, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong) sums it up best:\"When a decision like that is made by a government, it emboldens those who are already prejudiced to speak their deepest thoughts of hate. They assume they are simply brave enough to say what everyone really thinks.\u201dThis book does a really fantastic job of portraying institutionalized racial prejudice, and how terrifyingly easy it is for radical groups to normalize it. Shadowhunters' belief of their superiority over Downworlders and mundanes has been a common theme throughout both TMI and TID, but The Dark Artifices finally tackles this subject head-on. There's talk of creating a registry of Downworlders, of maintaining a distance between them and the Nephilim, supposedly for the benefit and safety of both groups. So many of the main characters' frustrations, anger, and despair in the face of such blatant institutionalized prejudice form a chilling parallel to the current events of our own world. This book makes it abundantly clear that fear and isolation are never the answer, and if\u2014as Kit suggests\u2014you look into how these patterns have played out over the course of mundane history, they almost universally lead to further violence and hatred. Similarly to what I mentioned above about the importance of Ty's character, this plot is important. When we read about these trends in books, we can see the horror and wrongness of them, but it\u2019s often more difficult to address the ones we witness in real life. If an issue doesn\u2019t immediately affect you, it can be easy to remain passive, to disregard it and assume it will blow over. This book reminds us that is not the case, that if such hatred is ignored, the wounds it leaves will only continue to fester. Changing a social stigma starts with individual people, with challenging the assumptions that you and many of the people you know may never have thought to question.I think that's all I have to say, apologies for how insanely long this review was. I have A LOT of thoughts and feelings about this book and this series, so thanks for bearing with me. <3Favorite quotes (obvs somewhat spoilery):\"I couldn't keep a fish alive,\" she said. \"I kill plants just by looking at them.\"\"I suspect I would have the same problem,\" Mark said, eyeing the fish. \"It is too bad--I was going to name it Magnus, because it has sparkly scales.\" There was something about him, something indefinably strange, a trace of the wildness of faerie that never failed to make Emma think of untrammeled, wide-open spaces, of freedom and lawlessness. I am a lost boy, his eyes seemed to say. Find me.\"There was never anything like a chance of redemption for Sebastian. But it doesn't stop the dreams, does it? In my dreams, I still sometimes see the brother I might have had, in some other world. The one with green eyes. And you might see the friend you had in Malcolm. When people die, our dreams of what they could be die with them. Even if ours is the hand that ends them.\" \"There is truth in stories,\" said Arthur. \"There is truth in one of your paintings, boy, or in a subset or a couplet from Homer. Fiction is truth even if it is not fact. If you believe only in facts and forget stories, your brain will live, but your heart will die.\u201dBut you couldn't speak to fear, couldn't tell it the truth: fear lived in your bones. Emma drew Cortana. It flashed like the setting sun, just before it drowned in the sea. So this is the Wild Hunt, he thought. This freedom, this expanse, this ferocity of joy. For the first time, he understood how and why Mark\u2019s choice to stay with his family might not have been an easy one. For the first time he thought in wonder of how much his brother must love him after all, to have given up the sky for his sake.\u201cEveryone is afraid of something. We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.\u201d\u201cThere's something about a place you've been with someone you love. It takes on a meaning in your mind. It becomes more than a place. It becomes a distillation of what you felt for each other. The moments you spend in a place with someone... they become part of its bricks and mortar. Part of its soul.\u201d Julian sought Mark in the crowd on the steps. He was standing with his hands behind his back, exchanging a mistrustful look with a carved stone garden gnome. \u201cYour pretense does not fool me, gnome,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMy eye will be upon you.\u201d\u201cSo what\u2019s the Herondale family motto? \u2018Chiseled but angsty\u2019?\u201dHe shrugged. \u2018If you don\u2019t know what your last name is, it\u2019s probably Herondale\u2019?\u201d \u201cI had never realized before how much you can take from someone by not allowing them the words they need to describe themselves.\u201dHe caught her by the wrist, brought her hand to his bare chest.

I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by James Marsters (who played Spike in Buffy) and he did a great job. I laughed at how the political climate in the Shadowhunter world mirrors some U.S. current events. I looooooved the characters of Kit and Ty. Emotional scenes brought the feels. It was fun to revisit locations from Clare's previous series.The one thing I really rolled my eyes at was that the romances got tangled beyond recognition. I don't even mind love triangles, and I'm fine with these relationships so it's not a huge gripe, it just felt a bit soap opera-ish at times. Clare definitely loves forbidden romances.I also think her books are a tad too long and over-full of details and the audio format is perhaps not the best fit for this story. I noticed that I missed a couple of POV switches, or transitions and was left wondering how the characters got to a new location. That's not the book's fault though, just a side effect of listening to an audiobook while multitasking, but it did influence how I perceived the story. I LOVE the audiobooks of this series though and will probably continue listening to them anyway."}, {"userName": "Caleb", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16381356-caleb", "userReview": "I finished this a month ago but BOIIII IM HURTIM NOT OKAYPLEASE READ THE SHADOWHUNTER BOOKS"}], "description": "Would you trade your soul mate for your soul?A Shadowhunter\u2019s life is bound by duty.
