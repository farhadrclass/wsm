The ratings were decent and the price was right but once I got started I realized it was going to be a disappointment. The references to Obama were, well, somewhere between juvenile and straight up conspiracy theorist.

The story is good, but the execution was not. Right off the hop the storytelling seems rushed and forced. The characters seem to barf up emotions in one liners. They are often one dimensional and rarely get developed beyond a brief introduction. Cade is portrayed as a no nonsense military figure and family man. The military prowess comes through, and the parts of the story describing military knowledge or actions are probably the best written in terms of flow and detail. Generally though, he seems more like an emotionless automaton going about his role in the story mimicking how a human should react but without any emotion or true understanding of human responses.This story was told in two parts, one from Cade's point of view, and another from his wife's as she attempts to survive with their daughter. Her half was more interesting, and her character more believable, but the storytelling still felt forced. Another point worth mention, the author also is very obviously not a fan of the Obama, and gets more than a little preachy on that point. Not my cup of tea, but perhaps not a deal breaker for everyone.Finally, it was badly in need of final editing review. Lots of little grammar errors that made this story less than a pleasure to read that probably could have been avoided.It's a shame as it feels like all the elements are there for a good story, but the execution is lacking. Judging from the reviews on the next book, it sounds like there are improvements, but I don't feel like it's something I'll be in a hurry to pickup."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1511509-andrea", "userReview": "So I'm almost done with the second in the series and I'll probably read the last because the STORY is pretty OK, but jeez, the writing? Not so much. It's like, put down the thesaurus and just tell the damn story. It's written like a romance novel, only instead of 102 different words for penis it's 102 different words for brain, head, zombie, wound, pretty much everything. And it's really adjective happy. At one point the author mixed up two characters refers to a character that already died as being the one that lived!He also seems way too obsessed with making sure we know that he knows his military jargon. That's great, I get it, you or someone you know was in the military. I wasn't and I rolled my eyes and skimmed whole paragraphs to get back to the story. Frustrating and mediocre."}, {"userName": "Misti", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34386522-misti", "userReview": "So this was book 5 in the Ultimate Undead Collection: The Zombie Apocalypse Best Sellers Boxed Set and I think it was the worst one yet.

However, the initial attack scene was totally off for me and the inner dialogue could have been so much better.This sort of sticky but bland writing continued but the actual story and characters were brilliant.Around chapter six it seems that SC slides into some awesome author mode and the book/writing steps up several gears. The beginning needs some more kick and condiments to it (IMO) to draw in new readers.The main characters are Cade, his wife Brook and daughter Raven. As they are on opposite sides of the country the dual settings and storylines really give good, but non distracting, tension.I really enjoyed all the news caster feed, back histories of the family and even the political rhetoric. The military element is there but again, it is non distracting to us less interested readers.As each group gathers and loses members no character is safe. There are occasional humour moments which really bring home the realism of the people and the horrors they are facing.The White House situation was a shock but brilliantly done, it also allowed for the \u201cwhy\u201d to occur. SC left the book hanging on a fantastic note, no shocking cliffhanger but I have to know what happens next."}, {"userName": "Colin Hickey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37483020-colin-hickey", "userReview": "Did not enjoy this book at all - mainly due to its conservative right -wing view. Too much military jargon, not well written and the supposed heros are not sympathetic with borderline racist & sexist views. Of course this all may be a clever ploy by the writer that was over my head, but it left me rooting for the zombies & for the end of the book. Additionally the author clearly has issues with presidents Clinton & Obama and his views are not subtle.Worst of all the author could not keep track of his own characters, confusing which characters he has already killed off and which are still alive. If the author cares so little for his characters & story then why should we?"}, {"userName": "Virginia Night", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29309859-virginia-night", "userReview": "Very enjoyableA delightful read.

The main character has special ops training and almost immediately adapts to the zombie apocalypse. It's probably the weakest part about the storytelling.I didn't really feel like the characters had a hard time accepting the end of the world. It was as if a switch was flicked and instantaneously everyone became excellent zombie hunters. Personally, I enjoy when zombie books explore the dissonance that characters suffer when they see what the world they inhabit has become. Trudge sort of blows by this stage of post apocalyptic acceptance. Sort of a bummer.The human on human violence in Trudge this is probably the strongest aspect of the story. If I do continue with the series, it will be to explore how low some roving bandits can go. Otherwise this is very standard stuff."}, {"userName": "Elliot", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53188093-elliot", "userReview": "Some of the worst writing I've ever encountered."}, {"userName": "Joy Jensen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22776019-joy-jensen", "userReview": "Trudge on to Book 2I read LOTS of Zombie series.

They are in different parts of the country and their problems are huge. The action starts early on in the story meaning that it does not mess around. The plot of the story is great. I think that the story would be better if all the army references were not made, because I did not even know the meaning of half of them. While reading this book I was always wondering if humanity would actually stoop down to such a level to take advantage of this apocalyptic world. Shawn Chesser can take away characters just as easily as adding them in. He writesin such a way that you seem to fear every stranger in the book living or not. All in all, the book is really good but needs a bit more improvement in making the book easier for someone to read (The army references) and making a larger audience"}, {"userName": "T.W.

Somewhat generic. I know he has a legion of fans, and I wanted to be one.The premise of crossing the country in this situation is a bit \"off\" for me. I will say that this book does do an exceptional job of setting the wheels in motion and allowing the ZA to unfold at a believable pace. I say give the book a try and see for yourself.

The characters are fleshing out nicely, this is a series so the book is open-ended until book 2 is available.

Yeah for me ;) But if you are a hard core political lefty you will likely be distracted and annoyed. If you are a righty, centrist, or apolitical you will enjoy this story and these characters.

Maybe it's just not my kind of story. It defies me how Amazon is selling this in the \"Science Fiction\" section of the Kindle Store. It's not science fiction at all, just 100% cliche zombie horror, totally predictable and not very interesting. The characterization was all over the place.

The book in tightly plotted, but not very much happens in the book. It is elevated slightly due to the narrative focusing on a family attempting to reunite during what appears to be the end of the world. There is a very right leaning bias to the writing which may or may not put you of the book depending on your political views. The political statements incorporated into the story are probably the weakest part of the book regardless of your political leaning. The other issue I have with the book is the inconsistent descriptions of how the zombies move. These zombies are clearly the slow shambling variety, yet the characters are continually surprised by the speed of attacks. It's as though zombies are spotted across a field and then suddenly they are clawing at a victim\u2019s throat. It doesn't make sense. I can see how some readers will get swept up in this series so that they can learn the ultimate mate of the central characters. I just don't see that there is enough depth to warrant twelve books and I doubt I will continue past this first book. I would only recommend this to serious fans of the genre.

I see a lot of people knocking the author for what may seem like a political axe to grind towards Democrats, but being a Dem myself I thought that it added realization to the story. I enjoyed the \" no one is safe\" touch to the book and how quickly society crumbles during disasters. Some peels commented that the outlaw biker gang touch was a clich\u00e9, but having grown up around outlaw biker gangs in Texas it isn't far fetched at all many of that lot are former military and despise the system. I like that the ending wasn't a predictable \"He finds his family\".
