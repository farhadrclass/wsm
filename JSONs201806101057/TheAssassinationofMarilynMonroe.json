If I were to find out that my beloved River Phoenix had not died of a drug overdose, but rather somebody had poisoned him, my heart would break a second time. That is how I feel right now about Marilyn Monroe.Ever since I was a little girl Marilyn Monroe was my favorite. I've read dozens of books about her and I've even read books about her death, speculations that she didn't actually commit suicide. But this book is a horse of a different color: it proves that not only was she murdered but the cover-up went all the way to the highest offices of the American government. The evidence that the then-president JFK and his brother the Attorney General were involved in her murder is mind boggling. I will never feel the same way about their family ever again, which is also upsetting because I've always idolized them too. Not only did the Kennedys murder my beloved Norma Jeane, they were all so incredibly rife with corruption. Much like with George W. Bush, JFK beat Nixon through voter fraud. Not only that, JFK was in the pockets of the Mafia. In this book I learned just to what extent, and I really had no idea that it was so bad. The myth of the Kennedy's Camelot was brought home to me here.I found it fascinating how people who were so scared to come forward 40 years ago, like in a Cold Case episode, came forward recently with what they knew and with what they saw in Marilyn's last moments, which turned out to be a very different story than the official one. I guess the truth always comes out eventually, no matter how many people try to prevent it. I suppose it is the nature of truth to want to be free and known.This book broke my heart. If Marilyn Monroe were alive today and was having an affair with the president I don't think that they would have killed for these indiscretions or even for whatever state secrets she might know. But in 1962, it appears that wasn't the case and Marilyn Monroe's threats to call a press conference not only about her affair with the president but also to discuss all of the secrets that she had regarding Cuba, the Mafia, fraud, and other indiscretions ultimately led to her murder.In many ways I'm very glad to know the truth about what happened to one of my favorite people in her last weeks on this planet. I'm also happy to know the truth about the Kennedys; now I can stop idealizing them and I'm in a much better position when conceiving of my third novel which will be about what the world would be like if JFK and RFK had not been assassinated. That story now will be much less of an homage to the Kennedys, but instead will explore the world that would've existed if Marilyn Monroe had given her press conference. And lived.This is such a hard book to read, so tragic, but because it is such a different version of American history than the one we've been spoon fed, it should be read by everyone."}, {"userName": "Marilyn D'Auria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3089827-marilyn-d-auria", "userReview": "I was given this book as an Xmas gift and was mildly interested but suspected it would not alter my opinion that she probably died from an accidental overdose.I was wrong.The amount of research amassed for this work is astronomical, especially the documentation connecting the intricate networking of the comintern in Marilyn's life as well as her whereabouts at almost every point in her life and her intimate connection to the presidency. The author has documented that the autopsy was a sham. She (MM) would have been dead long before being able to finish injesting the amount of pills found in her bloodstream. Other than her blood there is no evidence of pills in her body because the organs which would tell the story mysteriously disappeared. Death was certainly caused by injection directly to her bloodstream and not the staging of pills and a glass of water by her bed.I am also impressed by the depth to which this author understood his subject as a living, breathing, very complicated woman.A very compelling read. I almost certainly believe he is very close to the truth if not exactly right.Incidently, the fact that it is no longer being printed in the U.S. makes me wonder if the powers that be aren't still trying to suppress the truth.

This includes just about every detail on the life of Monroe that one could imagine. It discusses her relationships with many important figures in both her life and in society. It includes the layout of her home, all available coroner's notes, detailed biography of Monroe and the people in her life. He notes the suspects, the flaws in the suicide story, and even details in police, ambulance, and witness reports of the fateful night of the murder. Lastly, the bibliography included is something to be noted as it is extremely long and detailed. One can tell from the presentation of this and the writing that these are the words of someone who has spent years studying this subject, not just some conspiracy theorist. By far, the best book I've ever read on Marilyn."}, {"userName": "Mark Simmons", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7316173-mark-simmons", "userReview": "Wolfe is an excellent writer, giving a compelling account of Marilyn's life from her broken childhood through to Stardom and its inevitable conclusion. You really get the sense of a deeply complex, intelligent and talented person who's motivation was to be loved and accepted, but was used and misused by those around her. However, Wolfe is less successful at proving his theory that Bobby Kennedy and two police bodyguards overdosed her (accidentally by injection) while searching her house for her diary containing Kennedy, Mafia and Government Secrets. Sure, there are plenty of interesting facts that undermine the traditional suicide explanation, especially interference with the autopsy evidence, blocking of investigations, and key witnesses who clearly originally lied about the timescale and events of her final day. The presence of telephone wiretaps and bugs listening in to Marilyn's conversations, the Communists gathering sensitive information through their friendships with her, and her affairs with the good, the bad, and the gangster all suggest more was going on in private than the usual Hollywood intrigues splashed across the pages of newspapers and magazines. However, Wolfe takes a number of shocking witness accounts purely at face value, especially if they fit his murder theory ; a speculation that she had a child by JFK in the late 50s, a drugged rape by Frank Sinatra and his mobster pal weeks before her death to keep her quiet over mafia links to the Kennedys, melodramatic supposed comments on how she would bring the Great down by exposing secrets, only remembered by unreliable witnesses after her death. And so on. So while its a great and compelling read, that led me to question the official account of Marilyn's suicide to the point of discarding it in favour of now entertaining the suggestion of murder, Wolfe just didn't convince me that his finger is pointing in the right direction. As the Scottish Legal system sometimes says, when faced with inconclusive evidence, \"Case Not Proven\"."}, {"userName": "Joanna Mcdonald", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1065632-joanna-mcdonald", "userReview": "I never really knew much about Marilyn Monroe until I read this book. It gives you an insight to her life from her birth to her untimely death. The author (Donald Wolfe) doesn't beat around the bush in this book, he beleives she was murdered and even names the murderers and with the overwhelming evidence he produces, it's really hard not to beleive him or even beleive that something wasn't right.From the way the police handled her investigation until her funeral, was a complete farce, missing documents, interview tapes going missing etc etc.Coincidence or murder, make up your mind, I certainly did after reading it!!! xxx"}, {"userName": "The1likenevl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762320-the1likenevl", "userReview": "I've had this book for a few years now & cannot bring myself to read it. Everyone has an opinion on Marilyn Monroe untimely death but truly I believe she was murdered.

Whether or not you are a believer of conspiracy theories, you cannot help but see the authors point, which is articulated well throughout and summarised nicely towards the end of the book.Perhaps most importantly, this book does not attempt to glamorise Monroe, or her career. It offers a more humanistic approach to the actress, which hardcore Monroe fans may find difficult to digest. A must read for anyone interested in Monroe, her work, or the apparent cover ups surrounding the US government in the early 1960s. Even those with no real interest in Monroe should enjoy the conspiracy aspect of this book, finding the authors compelling arguments somewhat enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Jacqui", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9648184-jacqui", "userReview": "So ... the Commies (her analyst, her housekeeper, etc.) wanted to get close to Marilyn so they could get the dirt on the Kennedys while the Kennedys needed her dead because she had the dirt on their connections with the Mafia (election-rigging, Cuba, etc.). Hmmmm. Some of the medical evidence that her death couldn't have been self-administered is quite convincing, but as always, the author accepts without documentary evidence the sources that fit with his argument, and dismisses as spurious those that do not. However blurred the circumstances of her death might appear to be, personally, I can't accept that Bobby Kennedy rolled up at Marilyn's house with an accomplice who gave her a death shot, whether it was intended to sedate or actually kill her."}, {"userName": "Afsana", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2211610-afsana", "userReview": "Issue with thisthis was a good storytold the the events surrounding her death and the changes in story.

She was a force to be reckoned with. She challenged her directors, fought hard to find an artistic 'truth' in her characters and in doing so earned herself a reputation as a difficult woman to work with. But this book reveals her to be hard-working, dedicated and determined not to be forever trapped into dumb blonde roles and duff contracts. I read this book in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal - which made a lot of what it has to say all that more believable. It shows the history to the toxic culture in Hollywood, when male stars and executives abused their positions to dominate women and destroy careers. Marilyn Monroe fought the Hollywood system and she won... just. But this triumph was swiftly eclipsed by her dramatic death. Marilyn Monroe shouldn't have died when she did. There can be no question when reading this book that she was used, abused and manipulated by those around her, people she thought she could trust. It's kind of hard reading it to understand why the Kennedy's are held in such high esteem in America, but what is clear is the wide gulf between the squeaky-clean public perception and the morally ambiguous or debauched lifestyles of the rich and famous."}, {"userName": "Carrie Marshall", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3830972-carrie-marshall", "userReview": "I really liked this book. I'm a fan of all things Marilyn. And I do believe she did not kill herself with all the evidence. That's why I wanted to read this book.

Of course, when I saw SLIH, Marilyn had been dead for some years, but the conspiracies and controversies about her remain to this day.The Assassination of Marilyn Monroe, by Donald H. Wolfe was a fascinating read, and one I found very hard to put down. I first read this book a couple of years ago, and it is one that I re-read snippets of every now and then.What a complex and intriguing person Marilyn was! I thought that it was really sad that it seemed as though most of the people who were close to her, were really only looking out for themselves and what they could gain from being associated with her. Why couldn\u2019t anyone love her for who she really was, instead of what they thought they could get out of her? Why was she never able to find any inner peace or any sense of self-worth.Whilst I still don\u2019t know whether she was murdered or whether she committed suicide, this book does concentrate on and question a lot of the inconsistencies that were present during the investigation of her death.This was a fascinating insight to Marilyn\u2019s personal life and her career. There was certainly information in the book that was new to me. The Assassination of Marilyn Monroe is a must read for any Marilyn Monroe fan, and would be a very enjoyable read for those that enjoy biographies. My rating for The Assassination of Marilyn Monroe is 4.5/5"}, {"userName": "Alrik", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11433006-alrik", "userReview": "We have had to wait quite a long time for books that try to look behind the myth of the celebrity sex symbol Marilyn Monroe became, and bring to light the real flesh-and-blood human being she was behind the facade. This is one of the few books that does exactly that, and couples it with an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her mysterious death. Reading this, it quickly becomes clear there was definitely a lot of pain and suffering hidden behind all the glitter and glamour. After a very difficult childhood, Marilyn Monroe was used as a sex slave by many rich and famous people from an early age. She first met JFK when she was only 19, and had an ongoing \"affair\" with him until he broke with her in 1962, afraid that she would spill his many secrets. - SPOILER ALERT -From his many conversations with eye witnesses the author pieces together a very well-documented account of Marilyn's last hours. The only conclusion -from the autopsy report and phone records alone- can be that she was murdered by the intelligence agents which RFK brought with him because she knew too much.
