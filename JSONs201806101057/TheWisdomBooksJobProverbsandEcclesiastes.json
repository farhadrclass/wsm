Does one have to be a religious nut? \u201cThe Wisdom Books\u201d would be a great introduction to anyone--even those with more of a secular bent. Reading this book is similar to reading a familar poet with the student guide book immediately below each line. In this case, the poet lived thousands of years ago and we are not always certain what he meant. Alter is quick to point out where modern translators are unsure and explain why lines have been translated as we read them here and in the familar King James Version. I will agree with another reviewer that Proverbs became tedious. However, both Job and Qohelet play off the conventions of Proverbs. I can understand why these three books were bundled together. Ecclesiastes is as daring as I remember it to be and I found that Alter\u2019s explication of the internal structure brought even more to my understanding. Hebrew is such a rich language in its ability to make visual and aural puns. It makes me want to pull out my language primer again."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78287-tom", "userReview": "Robert Alter, well known for his translations of The David Story (I and II Samuel), The Psalms, and The Five Books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy), takes on another section of the Hebrew Bible: the three Wisdom Books of Job, Proverbs, and Qohelet (Ecclesiastes). As Alter mentions in his introduction, what makes these books unique amongst the canon is their universal, philosophical aim. Relatively unconcerned with the Temple cult of Israel, these books make general observations on life, both descriptive and prescriptive.The truth is, Job and Qohelet are a lot more fun to read, as they topple the banal moralisms of traditional piety. In both these books, life just doesn't make a lot of sense most of the time, but we humans still have to figure it out somehow. As longsuffering Job tells us after God and the Adversary have teamed up to strip him of everything he has:If only my hope were fulfilled,and my hope God might grant.If only God would deign to crush me,loose his hand and tear me apart.(6:8-9)Or Qohelet, lamenting life's unfairness:I returned to see under the sun that not to the swift is the race and not to the mighty, the battle, nor to the wise, bread, not to the discerning, wealth, nor to those who know, favor, for a time of mishap will befall them all. Nor does man know his time, like fish caught in an evil net and like birds held in a trap, like them the sons of man are ensnared by an evil time when it suddenly falls upon them.(9:11-12)Of all the books in the Hebrew Bible, these two look life squarely in the face and consider its possible meaninglessness. There's something in them that especially resonates in the early 21st century, after so many traditional structures have been ripped down.The bulk of Proverbs, by contrast, consists of witty formulations of reverential sayings, such as, \"When the Lord is pleased with the ways of a man, even his enemies will make peace with him\" (16:7). A number of these sayings are flatly contradicted by Qohelet and Job. To be fair, though, Proverbs does not attempt to present any sort of unified worldview. Many contradict one another (e.g., 26:4-5), and many are simply pragmatic observations without any moral overtones. See, for example, 21:14: \"A gift in secret allays anger, and a stealthy bribe, fierce wrath.\"Furthermore, the book of Proverbs actually contains several distinct sections. It opens with an extended (nine-chapter) praise of Wisdom, which many commentators have taken to be an allegorical figure or a cosmic principle. Christian interpreters, for instance, would later align some traits of cosmic Wisdom with the Logos (the Word) of John 1. Proverbs also contains two distinct sections that appear to be adaptations of Egyptian maxims (22:17-23:11 and 23:12-24:34), as well as (among other parts) what appears to be a confessional from someone named \"Agur, son of Yaqeh\" (30:1) and an acrostic poem about an ideal wife (31:10-31). In all, it's a bit of a hodgepodge, and though the praise of Wisdom is fascinating, the rest is about as fun as reading a collection of Ben Franklin's sayings.As for Alter's translation, he has focused on recapturing the peculiar qualities of Hebrew poetry: concise rhythm and vivid physical imagery. At times he does this well, as with Proverbs 27:19: \"Like water face to face, thus the heart of man to man.\" At others, he fails, as with the famous refrain of Qohelet 1:2: \"Merest breath, said Qohelet, merest breath. All is mere breath.\" Of course, I don't blame his failures - he is writing in the shadow of perhaps the most important book in the English language: the King James Bible. Not wanting to mess with a good thing, Alter occasionally repeats the word of the King James Version. Compare, for example their versions of Job 38:1-4, in which God finally responds to Job's cries of desperation:Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.(KJV)And the Lord answer Job from the whirlwind and He said:Who is this who darkens counselin words without knowledge?Gird your loins like a man,that I may ask you, and you can inform Me.Where were you when I founded earth?Tell, if you know understanding.(Alter)One further point of interest in this volume is the extensive footnotes providing commentary. While they occasionally intrude unnecessarily (such as in explaining a proverb that's fairly clear, or telling the reader that a given proverb is banal), they often provide great insight into textual and translational difficulties. As a translator of ancient texts myself (Chinese), I appreciate his lifting the veil a bit. All ancient texts are riddled with tiny scribal mistakes, the Bible included. The scholar, therefore, must compare versions, ancient translations, consider the possibility of mistaking one letter for another, etc., in order to produce the best version possible. I don't see this as a subversive act; in fact, I see it as a holy one. If you respect a text, you want to figure out what it's trying to tell you, what belongs there, etc. How much more so if you revere a text.That said, textual criticism is always to a degree subjective. While some things can be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty (\"this passage wasn't originally here because the language is from a later date\"), others are guesswork (\"this passage wasn't originally here because it's tone/message is different from the rest\"). This is nothing new. Even the King James translators made guesses in the face of a corrupt text (such as in Proverbs 24:21). Alter, for his part, remains fairly conservative, not proposing corrections unless they're absolutely necessary. My only beef with him (and the \"strong consensus of scholarship\" which he follows) is in regarding the final portion of Qohelet (12:9-14) as an editorial addition. The basis for this is not linguistic or archaeological, but the fact that the section contains pious message, which seems at odds with much of the rest of the book. However, the whole book of Qohelet, as Alter points out, brims with paradox and contradiction, an attempt to capture the vast inward contours of a human being. Why should such a writer, after all is said and done, come to the conclusion that it is best to \"fear God and keep His commands\" (12:13)? One suspects that modern scholars reject this passage as authentic as a projection of their own beliefs: they don't believe a deep thinker, wrestling with doubt, could conclude in reverence. And that, indeed, is a vanity of vanities."}, {"userName": "Michael Austin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin", "userReview": "I learned most of what I know about biblical poetry from Robert Alter's previous books on the subject--especially The Art of Biblical Poetry(1985), which I read in graduate school. From that book, I had a good general sense of how biblical verse was structured: primarily of the two-line verses where the first line introduces a topic, character, or idea and the second line completes, extends, or reverses the meaning of the first line. A great deal of the Old Testament was originally written in this kind of verse, and Alter's earlier book is a good way to understand the formal structure.Even so, I was not prepared for the extent to which a translation that paid strict attention to this one formal aspect would alter my perception of the texts. The Wisdom Books consists of Alter's translations of, and commentary on, Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes (which he refers to with the Hebrew name Qohelet. For me, Alter's versions of the first two of these books were revolutionary. I have read Job in a number of translations, but this is the first one that worked to preserve the original parallel couplets that make up most of the poem. I do not know enough Hebrew to judge the translation, but I do trust Robert Alter's scholarly abilities. But I can say with certainty that the formal parallelism of the paired lines shapes the meaning in ways that most translations do not capture. One of the things that makes poetry poetry is that it follows formal verse conventions in its construction--and, in great poetry, these formal elements always create meaning in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. This is notoriously difficult to capture in a translation, and I suspect that Alter is just trying to approximate the effect for the English reader. But he does a good enough job that I felt like I was reading the poem for the first time.I was even more impressed with Alter's translation of Proverbs. Most translations do use some kind of parallel couplet for the Proverbs, but Alter does a better job of anyone I know of conveying the different ways that the second verset of the couplet can relate to the first. He is especially good at bringing out the irony in this formal relationship and showing how, after a long string of second lines that extend the meaning of their predecessors, a single couplet that reverses its meaning cam have tremendous power. I have never enjoyed reading the Proverbs before, but, with Alter, it is kind of fun.As Robert Alter works his way through the Old Testament (The Wisdom Books is his fourth volume of translation with commentary) he is giving English-speaking readers a real gift: a scholarly translation of the Hebrew scriptures that pays supreme attention, not just to the words in the texts, but to the formal strategies that ancient writers used to turn these words into great literature."}, {"userName": "Zadignose", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4319285-zadignose", "userReview": "Silver has a crucible and gold a kiln,and the LORD tries hearts. --Proverbs 17:3Another excellent Bible translation from Robert Alter. And the Wisdom Books are where it's at. Qohelet/Ecclesiastes has now joined Job as among my favorite biblical books. Huzzah for cynical whining about our fate.I must grant that Proverbs can be tedious, unpleasant, and... sometimes horrifying!--(Your suffering is deserved, you poor miserable bastards!)--But there's good stuff in there too, plus Proverbs and the other books are kind of in a dialog/debate relating to the nature of justice, so the interrelationship of works is interesting.My very unfair quibble is that I would have been happy to see Alter's take on the deuterocanonical \"Book of Wisdom\" (a.k.a. Book of the Wisdom of Solomon), but I can't have such a thing. Fair enough, since it's not a part of the Hebrew Bible, it's treated as apocryphal by the protestants, and it's probably not even within the scope of Alter's language specialty. But... it would still be cool. Anyway, back to the Catholics for that one.I can't really do this book justice, of course, as I'm mentally exhausted and the only thing I can think to say at the moment is, it's niceness."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "Alter's translation of Job is beautiful.

In this book his writes an introduction to, translates, and comments on Job, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. He tells readers that \u201cthere is little in the three biblical books that is specifically Israelite.\u201d He notes that the wisdom books of Job and Ecclesiastes raise \u201ca raise radical challenge to the doctrine of reward for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, it dissents from a consensus view of biblical writers-a dissent compounded [in Job] by its equally radical rejection of the anthropocentric conception of creation that is expressed in biblical texts from Genesis onward.\u201d In regard to Ecclesiastes, which he calls Qohelet, Alter tells us, for example, that \"we are not entirely sure what Qohelet means, and whether it is a title or a name, so he chose, as many other scholars did, not to translate the term. He suggests that we think of Kohelet as a \u201cliterary persona of a radical philosopher articulating\u201d his view of life; meaning, the author invented the character Kohelet as his spokesman. He agrees with C. L. Seow in the Anchor Bible version, based on linguistic grounds, that the book was most likely composed \u201ca few decades before the conquest of Palestine by Alexander the Great in 333 BCE.\u201d The author\u2019s maxims are subversive. Some seem to be \u201ccitations of traditional maxims that are challenged or undermined.\u201d This, of course, raises the unanswerable question how all of life can be seen in a book \u201cin such a bleak light, [which] became part of the canon.\u201d Many rabbis suggest that the pious tilt in the book\u2019s epilogue, in 12:9-14, supported the conclusion to include the book in the canon. Alter writes \u201cit is surely attributing far too much naivet\u00e9 to the ancient readers to imagine that a few dozen words of piety at the end would deflect them from seeing the subversive skepticism emphatically reiterated throughout the book. We might add that it is possible that the book was included, as was Job, because Judaism is not averse to ideas contrary to traditional ones, and the ending was added at the time when the book was included in the canon to make it acceptable to the general public.Alter understandably dislikes, as many other do, the seventeenth century King James translation of hevel as \u201cvanity.\u201d He prefers \u201cfutility,\u201d or better yet, the way he translates it \u201cmerest breath,\u201d a \u201cflimsy vapor that is exhaled in breathing, invisible except on a cold winter day and in any case immediately dissipating in the air,\u201d for it captures the idea that life and everything connected to it are utterly insubstantial and transient.\u201d He understands, I think correctly, that the author uses the term elohim often as \u201ca stand-in for the cosmic powers-that-be, for fate or the overarching dynamic of reality that is beyond human control,\u201d in other words, the laws or powers of nature. He notes that this is also the meaning of the term frequently in other biblical books, including the Pentateuch.His translation of this biblical book is, as is his translation of other biblical books, excellent. For example, while many translators render 1:14\u2019s description of human activity as \u201cpursuit of the wind,\u201d he has \u201cherding the wind,\u201d which is a futile activity, it cannot be done.His explanations are equally excellent. Verse 2:24\u2019s \u201cThere is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and sate himself with good things through hid toil\u201d is not a contradiction to his view that all activities are futile, pure midst. Although \u201cthe simple pleasures of life of the senses here and now are all we have, and we might as well take advantage of them.\u201dThe Kohelet author included good advice in his book. Verse 11: 1 is a good example: \u201cSend out your bread upon the waters, for in the long course of time you will find it. Alter agrees with Rashi, ibn Ezra and other medieval commentators that people should \u201cperform acts of beneficence, for you never know when you yourself may benefit from having done so.\""}, {"userName": "Mack Hayden", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden", "userReview": "I\u2019ve heard a lot about Robert Alter over the years, from believers and nonbelievers alike.

But this book did confirm yet again that I really, really love Job and Ecclesiastes and hope everyone, of any religious or irreligious persuasion, reads them someday."}, {"userName": "Joseph R.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4737491-joseph-r", "userReview": "This book is another volume in Robert Alter's ongoing series of bible translations and commentaries. Here he focuses on the Wisdom literature, books that grapple with larger issues or present practical maxims for life. Alter presents Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, though typically Sirach, the Book of Wisdom, The Song of Songs, and the Psalms are included in lists of biblical Wisdom literature. Alter has written a translation and commentary of Psalms (see my review here) and does acknowledge some psalms fall into the \"Wisdom literature\" category. Sirach and the Book of Wisdom are deuterocanonical texts which is perhaps why Alter doesn't include them. The Song of Songs is attributed to Solomon (the wisest king of Israel) though it has more the character of the Psalms and is a bit of a biblical odd ball (it's a love poem that can be interpreted theologically). I suppose Alter has material for a sequel if he wants.What of the books he does cover? Job is the classic biblical text that grapples with why good people suffer. Job is an upright and pure servant of God. In the framing story, the Adversary (hasatan in Hebrew, where we get the name Satan from) comes to God's court and challenges Job's uprightness. Take away all the good things you have given him and surely Job will curse you, the Adversary argues. God lets the Adversary take almost everything away, leaving Job covered in sores sitting on a ash pit. With him are three friends who argue the standard pietistic conclusion that Job must have sinned or else why is he punished so grievously? Job continually claims his innocence. The translation is smooth and Alter's notes are very interesting. He considers this some of the finest poetry in the Bible and does his best (which is quite good) to render it into English.Proverbs is an anthology of some longer and shorter wisdom works. Famous parts where Lady Wisdom invites all to take her gifts or the acrostic poem praising a \"worthy woman\" at the end are stronger poetry than the massive collection of one- and two-line bits of practical advice or moral observation about the world and people. Being shown the discreet units within the book helps to understand them individually and to highlight their differences and similarities. Alter's notes and comments are helpful in comprehending a varied text.Ecclesiastes (which Alter refers to as its Hebrew title Qohelet) includes both a challenge to received wisdom like Job and strings of aphorisms like Proverbs. It is not however a synthesis of the two books, but a search for meaning in life while constanty aware of the brevity and transience of the things and people in this world. Riches and intelligence don't guarantee happiness; folly could be just as valuable as wisdom in bringing relief to life's miseries. Alter re-translates the King James \"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,\" with \"Merest breath, all is mere breath.\" He explains this is technically more accurate (the concrete image of an exhalation or sigh as opposed to the abstract image of emptiness). The switch is jarring in the good way of making the reader think more about the meaning and intent of the words. The only problem I had was that his phrase lost its evocativeness very quickly (since the phrase is repeated constantly in the text). It comes off more like a refrain than reassertion of the fleeting nature of everything described by Qohelet. I think Alter misses the mark here, but even his mistakes are interesting and thought provoking.Overall, Alter's translation and commentary are fascinating to read and helpful to understand the texts in a literary light.SAMPLE QUOTE:Fear the sword, for wrath is a sword-worthy crime, so you may know there is judgment.

The introductions and notes themselves make this book worthwhile. However, Alter's tight, somewhat cryptic translations create an all new perspective on the Hebrew Bible as a work of art. In this particular book. the translation of Job and the accompanying notes are worth the price of the book by themselves. Alter provides an outstanding analysis of the work, pointing out suspect and defective text, offering interpretive options and truly getting to the intent of the Job poet. Alter brings to life -- and helps make relevant -- the Job poet's discussion of the eternal question: why bad things happen to good people. By comparison, Proverbs is not as interesting, being a trite listing of religious orthodoxies. But Alter's translation again clarifies and illuminates. Ecclesiastics is more interesting and again Alter clears up some previously mysterious passages. I highly recommend this book, especially the translation of Job. Alter takes these ancient texts and makes them relevant for the modern reader.Re-Reading Qohelet (Ecclesiastics) (12/14)This is a wonderful little work that escaped my full comprehension the first time I read it following the majestic sweep of the Book of Job. I was truly struck by the skepticism and fatalism of Qohelet. \u201cMerest breath. All is mere breath.\u201d (1:2) Or, as most English speakers know it, \u201cVanity, all is vanity.\u201d We are transitory creatures, part of a repeating cycle in which we die and are forgotten \u2013 the good and evil, the wise and foolish, man and beast (3:19). Praises should go to the dead over the living, and the unborn over all. (4:2-4) No one knows what will happen or why. (8:8)It is best to enjoy this life as we can. \u201cLook I have seen what is good: It is fit [for a man] to eat and to drink and enjoy good things in all his toil that he toils under the sun in the number of the days of his life that God gave him, for that is his share.\u201d (5:17) Life hereafter? \u201cWho knows whether man\u2019s spirit goes upward and the beast\u2019s spirit goes down to the earth. And I saw that nothing is better than that man should rejoice in his works, for that is his share, for who bring him to see what will be after him?\u201d (3:21-22)Qohelet is a wonderfully skeptical work \u2013 even cynical. It has, however, inconsistencies. These could be the additions of another author, errors in transmission or simply the wandering thoughts of the original author. Chapter 10, in particular, seems to be a list of commonplace aphorisms and proverbs that are out of place. Otherwise, though, a beautiful, poetic work that deserves re-reading throughout one\u2019 life. Re-reading Job (04/15)I\u2019ve been re-reading various translations of Job, including Alter\u2019s, Mitchell\u2019s and the American Revised. Alter\u2019s translation with its revealing footnotes is required, but I have to admit to growing admiration for the King James Version. The differences are revealing and surprising. Here are just a few of my favorite passages:4:17\u201cCan a mortal be cleared before God?Can a man be made pure by his Maker?\u201d \u201cShall moral man be more just than god?Shall a man be more pure than is maker?\u201d5:14\u201cBy day they encounter darkness,As in night they go groping at noon.\u201d\u201cThey meet with darkness in the daytimeAnd grope at noon as the in the night.\u201d6:21\u201cFor now you are His.You see panic and you fear.\u201d\u201cFor now ye are nothing;Ye see my casting down, and are afraid.\u201d7:17-21What is man that You make him greatAnd that You pay heed to him.You single him out every morning,Every moment examine him.How long till You turn away form me?You don\u2019t me go while I swallow my spit.What is my offense that I have done to You,O Watcher of man?Why did you make me Your targetAnd I became a burden to You?And why do You not pardon my crimeAnd let my sin pass away? For soon I shall lie in the dust.You will seek me, and I shall be gone.\u201d\u201cWhat is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.14:01-2\u201cMan born of womanScant of days and sated with trouble,Like a blossom he comes forth and withers,And flees like a shadow \u2013 he will not stay.\u201d\u201cMan that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Russell Fox", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729679-russell-fox", "userReview": "Unlike some of the other Old Testament translations by Robert Alter, I feel odd giving this one any particular rating. His translation of the Five Books of Moses was truly eye-opening to me, his take on Joshua, Judges, the the books of Samuel and David (Ancient Israel) also taught me a lot, and his presentation of the Psalms really got me thinking. But each of those previous works either laid out a connected narrative (however many centuries or literary styles might have been incorporated into the final Biblical text), or covered a single book of the Bible, with a single defined style. This book doesn't. Alter makes a strong case there there are clear similarities between Job, the Book of Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes--most simply, because each in different ways reflected or promoted the \"Wisdom\" tradition which was widespread in the societies of the post-exilic Middle East, a tradition which was pragmatic, \"realistic,\" and which, in the Hebrew case, directly challenged the pious Deuteronomist tradition of a chosen people whom God will ultimately reward if they keep His commandments. But a shared perspective doesn't necessarily make for a translation that can be easily reviewed as a whole. So what did I get out of its three distinct parts? Basically, I really liked his Job; not enough for me to prefer it to the Revised English Bible, whose Old Testament is the one I've been reading for the past year and a half, but enough that I learned a good deal from it (as reluctant as I am to give up on Elihu, whose speeches I've always kind of liked, Alter made me realize that those chapters really likely are an interjection into the text). Proverbs, I must confess, I found repetitive, even a little tedious. But Ecclesiastes--or \"Qoheleth\" as Alter prefers, writing that the original Hebrew is too variable in meaning to be reduced to an antiquated English transliteration the Latin \"gatherer\" or \"speaker\"--really surprised me. I found through those sayings a fairly consistent, if not entirely uniform, kind of pious fatalism, one that I, at least, could easily see aligned with certain Calvinist streams of Christian though (a stream I am not necessarily opposed to). What say there is a God, one who is all-powerful, one who has set the terms of human existence, one whom we know is there, but we don't know what He'll do, or if He'll do anything, or if He's going to judge us for our mistakes harshly or compassionate, or if He's going to judge us at all? Would that be terrifying? Or would it, instead...be freeing? The Speaker suggests the latter, which I find persuasive. But then, I also find Martin Luther's \"Freedom of a Christian\" persuasive, the argument that in our absolute and total dependence upon God's grace comes a kind of liberation. The Speaker himself (herself?) might well have been some kind of ancient defender of justification, in an odd sort of way: why shouldn't we simply content ourselves with the goods of this life, such as they are, since in acknowledging God all is settled anyway? Anyway, it was a thought-provoking read--and as that's exactly what I've hoped to get out of this journey through the Old Testament, I'm satisfied."}, {"userName": "Scriptor Ignotus", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7422525-scriptor-ignotus", "userReview": "As Alter's commentary makes clear, the style and subject matter of the Wisdom Books (Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes/Qohelet) represent a marked departure from the fervid triumphalism of the earlier, more historically-based books of the Hebrew canon. They appear to have been composed at a time when the spirit of zealous piety and machismo that had accompanied commentary on the rise of the Kingdom of Israel had abated somewhat, and this abatement brought about Hebrew participation in a cosmopolitan culture of regional wisdom literature. Job and Proverbs especially seem to have been influenced by earlier Egyptian wisdom texts, so it seems that the Israelites were beginning to see themselves as one nation and tradition among many, while retreating somewhat from the notion that the ultimate truth of things was being borne out in their own national history. The three texts make references to God in the singular, so their authors and the characters they use are still monotheistic, but Alter notes that there is nothing explicitly Jewish or Israelite about them; they work just as well for readers from any other part of the near east. Job is one of the most fascinating of the Hebrew scriptures in terms of its subject matter, as well as being one of the most unique literary products in the Jewish or Christian canons. Its unique style and appropriations of language have led Alter, as well as other scholars, to suggest that the story was almost entirely the product of a single individual's creative voice, and that this individual must have had extraordinary poetic gifts. Job's laments, and the various responses of his theological friends are delivered in elegant verses that build upon one another and grow in sophistication, until God delivers a poem from the whirlwind that surpasses them all. Proverbs is a long and rather more eclectic series of wisdom teachings. There are some enjoyable aphorisms to be found within them, but for my part I can't help but find many wisdom teachings, Jewish or otherwise, rather platitudinous and not very instructive. I had the same feeling when reading some of the Buddha's teachings in the Dhammapada. Yes, be good, associate with good people, avoid bad things, avoid bad people. But without elaboration, these instructions are vacuous. Of all the aphorism-slinging wisdom teachers i've encountered in my reading, my favorite must still be Nietzsche. Ecclesiastes (Qohelet, as Alter titles it) is a pithy reflection on the transitory nature of our lives and everything we build with them; the absurdity of all of our strivings in the face of death, the great equalizer. The questions it poses are as relevant now as ever: what exactly is the point of trying to be a good person, or of learning, or even of living at all? Being wise and practicing kindness towards others may be the best way to live in the here-and-now, but what is the ultimate point of such virtues if in one hundred years time there will be no one around to even remember that we possessed them? Even as Qohelet belabors such questions, he still expresses a belief in the inherent goodness of wisdom and selflessness, and to that end, I find it similar in tone to the writings of the Stoics, who held similarly bleak views on the meaning of life, yet still found cause to celebrate virtue as its own reward."}, {"userName": "Mary Overton", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton", "userReview": "\"Wisdom literature is as close as the ancient Near East came to Greek philosophy, which was nearly contemporaneous with the latest Wisdom texts of the Hebrew Bible. It shares with Greek philosophy an inquiry into values and a disposition to reflect on the human condition, but it lacks both the purely theoretical and the systematic impulses of the Greek thinkers. Ethical issues are raised, but there is no real ontology, epistemology, anthropology, or metaphysics, and much of the thrust of Near Eastern Wisdom is pragmatic and even explicitly didactic. Job, for all its profundity, is a theological rather than a philosophic text. Its author is God-obsessed and never wonders or speculates about God's existence but rather expresses his outrage at the spectacular injustice of a world governed by a purportedly just God. Qohelet [Ecclesiastes], concerned as it is with the structure of reality and how ephemeral human life is locked into that structure, is close to a genuinely philosophic work, though it articulates its philosophy through incantatory language and haunting imagery rather than through systematic thought.\" location 265Job's wish comes true:\"Would, then, that my words were written,that they were inscribed in a book,with an iron pen and leadto be hewn in rock forever.\"JOB 19:23-24The dilemma:\"One person dies full of innocence,completely tranquil and at peace.His udders are filled with milk,the marrow of his bones still moist.Another dies with a bitter heart,and he has never enjoyed good.Together in the dust they lie,and the worm will cover them.\"JOB 21:23-26"}, {"userName": "Melting Uncle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17444608-melting-uncle", "userReview": "Who wrote Job and Ecclesiastes? It's hard to imagine what kind of crazy MF's these two writers must have been.Proverbs is like a collection of fortune cookie fortunes. I thought \"OK, great, all these nuggets of wisdom\" but it's a little more complicated than that. Some of the fortunes contradict each other. Some of them seem wrong. Some of the proverbs are priggish, some archaic, etc. There are in fact a few really good ones in there but you'll just have to find them for yourself ;)5 stars for Robert Alter's translation project but these were not my favorite of his translations. I get that he is trying to stay faithful to the original Hebrew and maybe he's trying to preserve a certain linguistic roughness which is fine BUT in the future if I were to return to these texts I would probably try to find a more colloquial translation. I bought Stephen Mitchell's version of Job and it looks pretty cool.Compared to the other Robert Alter translations I've read this is a 4/5 but compared to most other books, the stuff contained on these pages is head explodingly good. I would encourage everybody to read Job and Qohelet even if they aren't religious... I was surprised by their almost nearly borderline atheistic character. They are complex and knotty and if you can figure them out I guess you're smarter than everybody else for the last 2500 years.

It gives the reader much more about which to think.I mainly read the portion regarding Qohelet (Ecclesiastes), from which comes the reference for the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" by Hemmingway. I read both in high school, and now that I understand Qohelet so much better I want to go back and re-read Hemingway. There are several songs with lyrics that might have been adapted from Ecclesiastes 3. One very popular song that definitely was so adapted was written by Pete Seeger and reached #1 on the UK singles chart with its recording by The Byrds named \"Turn! Turn!

Alter's comments are wonderful, Job is a fascinating poem, Ecclesiastes surely one of the great splenetic explosions in world literature. The first nine chapters of Proverbs are fine, there's some drama there as a father tries to convince his son not to be an idiot. From my own childhood, I know that's a tough task. Five stars for all that stuff. But Proverbs 10 forward... holy mother of God (unsuitable as that expression is). These are books in the Jewish tradition, too, but forcing people to read Proverbs reminds me of Calvin: human beings are completely depraved if they can come up with that nonsense, and *then* *also* put it into not one, but *two* collections of divinely inspired literature. I imagine a Calvinist preacher somewhere thundering about the fate of those predestined to hell: it's having Proverbs read to you for the rest of eternity by someone who believes, passionately, in the wisdom of the proverbs attributed to Solomon.

Enjoyed Job, got really tired of Proverbs (am I not pious enough?) and enjoyed thoroughly Ecclesiastes. From the introduction to Ecclesiastes: \"The central enigma, then, of the Book of Qohelet is how this text of radical dissent, in which time, history, politics, and human nature are seen in such a bleak light, became part of the canon.\" I think all our canons could use a little more dissent included in them. \"We are unlikely ever to have a confident explanation of why Qohelet--or, for that matter, Job or Esther or the Song of Songs--entered the canon, but its inclusion suggests that hte canon may not have been determined solely on the grounds of ideological and theological conformity. In regard to its literary power and the uncompromising rigor of its observation of the human condition, this was clearly one of the most original texts produced in the biblical period, earl or late.\""}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13032337-alex", "userReview": "Alter's translations are helpful mainly for the academic (though the committed reader will find things here as well) who wishes to understand the words, syntax, and poetic structure of the books in the bible. From reading another piece by him, it seems that the poetical elements are his main interest. Even more interesting for me however are Alter's extensive notes; everything from Melville and Kafka references to detailed explanations of the original Hebrew and Aramaic words scatter every page. As is the nature for any work revolving religion, there is a perceivable opinion and interpretation going on; however I would not say it takes away from the work as a whole that much."}, {"userName": "Jack Caulfield", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56409886-jack-caulfield", "userReview": "Ancient 'wisdom' strikingly modern in its existential concerns. Alter's translation is wonderfully bare and direct, and his commentary is helpful for its elucidation of some of the more obscure passages, as well as for the bold links it draws with modern writers like Kafka and Nabokov. The comparisons are not invalid, either. Job's punishment for a crime he is unaware of is clearly recalled in Kafka, and Qohelet in Alter's translation frequently sounds like a Beckett monologue.
