The biggest reason is that the author lives 30 minutes away in Hendersonville, NC. Miss Julia is an elderly woman who is just now finding her place in this world and the story of her tangling with NASCAR is pretty funny. As with the first of this series, the relationship she has with her late husband's mistress and their son is the core of the story and does not disappoint. I can't wait to watch \"Little Lloyd\" grow up in the remaining books. Whenever the latest \"Miss Julia\" book comes out, it is a celebration at the library in which I work. The patrons, many elderly themselves, flock to her stories. As will I as I work myself through the series."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/363239-jennifer", "userReview": "I really enjoyed \"Miss Julia Speaks her Mind,\" so I was anxious to read the rest of the series. While I enjoyed this second installemnt, I found Miss Julia a little annoying in this one. Her \"speaking out,\" was getting on my nerves because it was directed at someone who was trying to help her. The outspokeness was endearing in the first novel because the people really deserved to be told off. Her evasion of the law made me uncomfortable, and I couldn't get into the little romances - there wasn't enough build up for them to be believable. I had predicted the ending half way into the novel as well. So all in all it was pretty disappointing, but still a fun, lighthearted read."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1551940-tracy", "userReview": "I didn't like this book nearly as much as the first one in the series.

I also have the same impression of Miss Julia Springer of Abbotsville, North Carolina as I have of Agatha Raisin - I find it hard to like this character. In book 2 Miss Julia is more sharp-tongued, self-righteous, abrasive, opinionated, bossy, rude, feisty and with a goal is to keep everyone she knows on her version of the straight and narrow path. Most mystery books (murder or otherwise) have a theme, and this one is no exception - it's theme is NASCAR racing.Hazel Marie Puckett and her son, Little Lloyd, are happily living with Miss Julia now. Hazel Marie had been her deceased husband's mistress and Little Lloyd was their son. In Christian charity Miss Julia took them in and has learned to love them both. The pastor of the church across the street has been instructing Hazel Marie in the Presbyterian catechism which becomes part of the climax. One night she goes to dinner and the movies with Wilson T. Hodge, the church fundraiser, and never returns home. She doesn't even call to say she has been delayed. The next day Miss Julia goes to the police to declare her missing, but Lieutenant Peavy tells her to call a private investigator because he doesn't consider her missing yet. Miss Julia hires J.D. Pickens to find Hazel Marie. She doesn't tell him, until he's hired, that she and Little Lloyd are going to tag along and help in the search. She doesn't trust him yet and wants to know his every move. He is, of course, annoyed and unappreciative of the help. In the meantime, a sheriff's deputy arrives to serve papers on the missing Hazel Marie and a snatch and grab order on Little Lloyd. Her sleazy televangelist uncle, Brother Vern, has filed a complaint alleging that Hazel Marie is an unfit mother and that Little Lloyd should be taken away from her. His ulterior motive is Little Lloyd's inheritance. Now Miss Julia is desperate to find Hazel Marie in time for the court date and to hide Little Lloyd from the law. Hazel Marie finally calls and asks for help, but the phone is disconnected as she says she's at the Big-----. It doesn't take long for J.D. and a clue Hazel Marie left behind to steer him to a connection with NASCAR racing and two competing race teams heading by race drivers Jerry Johnson (who turns out to be a friend of J.D.'s) and Bobby Bigelow who has stolen a lucky charm from Johnson. One of the funniest scenes in the book is Miss Julia and Little Lloyd rescuing Hazel Marie and the resultant high-speed car chase between Miss Julia driving and an RV on a banked NASCAR track.The climax happens during an ice storm at the Presbyterian church across from Miss Julia's house with everyone in attendance including the competing race car drivers. The tables are turned on the sanctimonious pastor and Brother Vern and they see the error of their ways - maybe. Subplots include:- Sam Murdock, Miss Julia's former lawyer, has broken his leg and has a young, blond, sexy home health aide named Etta Mae Wiggins attending him. Miss Julia's jealousy rears it's ugly head.- Miss Julia's friend, LuAnne Conover, needs advice about her husband who has a male problem that is affecting her love life. Proper Miss Julia is appalled when she finds LuAnne flirting with Jerry Johnson, the race car driver.- After Hazel Marie is rescued, J.D. Pickens is enamored with her. Will he appear in future books?Returning characters are Lillian, Miss Julia's maid and witty confidant; and Deputy Coleman Bates who rents a room at Miss Julia's house and is dating Binkie, her current lawyer.There were some funny moments, but the main problem I have with this book is how Christians are portrayed. They seem to be manipulators, hypocrites, busy bodies, liars, etc. with no redeeming values. Just an OK read. I hope the author hits her stride and the next in the series meets my expectations."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22460827-catherine", "userReview": "This was a good book.When Miss Julia burst on the scene in her fictional debut, Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind, this proper lady of a certain age found her orderly world turned upside down when Hazel Marie Puckett appeared with her nine-year-old son, Little Lloyd, who looked disturbingly similar to Miss Julia's late husband. Now, in Miss Julia Takes Over, with her sharp tongue and iron backbone intact, Miss Julia must tackle another disruption when Hazel Marie doesn't return from a dinner date with a fund-raiser who, in Miss Julia's opinion, wears his shorts too tight. Frantic and unable to persuade the local police that Hazel Marie is in danger, Miss Julia hires J. D. Pickens to investigate, despite her reservations about his taste for beer and women.

I like strong female protagonists and Miss Julia certainly has the character for such a role.

One of the reviewers on the back described her as the northern version of Miss Daisy, and that's pretty much on target.

In that debut book, Miss Julia's proper existence was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a close \"friend\" of her deceased husband. Hazel Marie, with \"heels too high, a dress too short, and hair too yellow\", showed up on Miss Julia's doorstep, bringing scandal, adventure, and nine-year-old Little Lloyd into her life. Now, in Miss Julia Takes Over, she's Little Lloyd's guardian and fast friends with his mother. So she's frantic when Hazel Marie disappears after a dinner date with a church fund-raiser, who, in Miss Julia's opinion, wears his shorts too tight: \"nobody can be th at upright and pious without trouble going on underneath\". Since the sheriff won't help her, Miss Julia takes matters into her own hands and, with Little Lloyd in tow, finds herself tracking Hazel Marie all across North Carolina.
