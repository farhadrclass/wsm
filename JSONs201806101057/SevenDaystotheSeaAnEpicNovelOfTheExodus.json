Miryam did not come across as likeable because, in my view, she lacked the ability to self-examine and thus felt herself righteous and was rigid rather than kind. Right at the end, she finally opens her eyes after being smited by Yahveh for claiming to be his mouthpiece. Truly, the God of the Jews was a jealous God and not very kind; if He made humanity I have never understood why He then punishes groups and individuals for being human. But that's a philosophical debate and not this book! Which is an excellently well-written story."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/683792-jen", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. More surprising since by almost every equation, I should have been at best mildly entertained. Instead, I actively liked.This book tells the story of Miriam and Zipporah, who before this book I would have said \"I'm pretty sure those names are biblical\" but I wouldn't be sure who they were. I would have guessed Old Testament because a) I've read the Bible and b) every woman in the New Testament is named Mary.Miriam is the sister of Moses, Zipporah is Moses' wife. Although, there's limited info given in the bible, Kohn extrapolates a lot and...let's just admit it...makes stuff up. The good news is the stuff she makes up is pretty dang entertaining. Miriam is a flawed prophet, dealing with her own need for control. Zipporah has been hurt and damaged by events, leading her to doubt her worth. On and the culture clash.The story flips back and forth between the two narrators, yet I wasn't horribly annoyed by that, if for no other reason than they didn't change fonts...I hate when they change fongs. Thought the woe is me from both of them got seriously old at time, I didn't get too annoyed. A fun read that I will try to find more like it."}, {"userName": "Merredith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1583037-merredith", "userReview": "This is a historical fiction book about the book of Exodus in the bible, spanning from right before Moses's birth, to right before they had to wander the extra 40 years in the wilderness. It was told from the point of view of Moses's sister and wife, switching back and forth. His sister, Miryam is the most annoying, uptight, bitter character ever. I spent the whole book just hating her. I was also not happy at all with their God. Tzipporah seemed to be able to tell all of the bad things that would be happening in this god's name over time, which is true. It was an interesting retelling and made me definitely want to go out and re-read Exodus, which I'm going to do soon. I had forgotten how violently immediate god was in those days, very hands on, paying attention to every little thing about these few people. Reminded me of a tv show episode I saw like that when they were in an alternate reality, maybe it was Futurama, I can't remember. Overall, a good book, I just wish she could have made Miryam have SOMETHING likeable about her. something."}, {"userName": "Sydney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/743203-sydney", "userReview": "I learned a lot about the Exodus, a bible story that I know, but not in great detail. I was frustrated with the characters in this book.I really didn't like Moses much after reading it. The way he treated his wife was awful. I know he was on a mission from God, but he never should have taken a wife if he was just going to toss her aside. He knew for a long time that he was called to serve God. And while he had a specific job to do, he should have still found a way to honor his wife.And Miriam made me made because she was very self-centered. And Zipporah just kept putting up with the poor treatment from both Miriam and Moses.I've read two other bibilical fiction novels. I found \"The Red Tent\" and \"The Gilded Chamber\" much easier to read. They weren't cakewalks, but I was at least able to identify with and admire the strong female characters.The women in this book were strong, but I didn't respect them much."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5858806-ruth", "userReview": "c2006: FWFTB: Moses, Exodus, sister, lover, devotion. It was a brave decision of the publishers to subtitle this as an 'epic' novel of the Exodus. My definition of epic is 'heroic or grand in scale or character' and I don't think that this book quite made it in either measure. It was a good quick read and the author put an interesting slant onto the known tales from the Old Testament but there were some events where the plotting/descriptions didn't make too much sense to me - and here I am thinking in particular of the circumcision episode. \"I did nor know whether to be happy that I would be in His presence or sad that I received no special distinction.\""}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1568669-sandra", "userReview": "I loved this book right from the start. The book starts with the sister of Moses and his life with her and the family. Then flips to the life of the women who will eventully become his wife. It follow the life of Moses from the eyes of these two great women who are both different but help Moses on his quest to free the people and deliver God's word. The book flips between the two women, and it give a great view of the life at that time in two different views and keeps you wanted to find out what will happen next. Even when I really did know how it ends because I had read that chapter in the bible and I did see the movie \"The Ten Commandments\". I still didn't want it to end."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7631030-shaun", "userReview": "A great historical fiction novel about the Exodus. I have not read many books about the Exodus let alone one from the perspective of a woman. Miryam and Tzipporah are amazing and strong female characters to read about. Both serve as strong foils for each other one representing structure and order and the other freedom and chaos. Both see Moses differently and think they each know what he needs. I really enjoyed Kohn's twist on the plagues of Egypt and the journey to the promised land. A great read overall!"}, {"userName": "Joy Matteson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6425940-joy-matteson", "userReview": "I love good historical biblical fiction. I don't just say 'biblical' fiction, because that does not qualify it as historical to some authors. This is historical biblical fiction at its finest--Ms. Kohn has obviously done some wonderful research on the Ancient Near East to supplement the Biblical account of the Exodus. The book's POV come from both Tzipporah, Moses' wife, and Miryam, Moses' sister, who are antagonists for most of the book, but tell a tale of harrowing survival and hope at the birth of a nation. Fascinating stuff."}, {"userName": "Shalon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1567612-shalon", "userReview": "I'm currently in a 32 week study of the Life of Moses and it was nice to get my imagination flowing as to how the bible characters actually lived out the enslavement, the Exodus, the wandering in the wilderness, etc. Putting a very human spin to the history we know about Moses is exciting. However, I must say this book took A LOT of liberties in what may have gone on during Moses' time and it is FICTIONAL in a lot of areas. Don't take it as biblical."}, {"userName": "Erika Feller", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/812735-erika-feller", "userReview": "This book reminded me that people called upon to do extraordinary things are still just people and apt to be just as petty, self-involved, hurtful but also able to get over it. The book tells the story of the exodus from the points of view of Miriam and Zipporah, each chapter is told in the voice of one or the other - a style I really like.Not as good as The Red Tent, but still really pretty good."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4707303-michelle", "userReview": "Generally I enjoy fictional retellings of Biblical narratives, but for some reason I just didn't love this one. I kept reading, anxious to see how the characters changed in the end, but for the most part they stayed stuck in their paths. Of course lots of liberty was taken with the Biblical Exodus account, but in this case those liberties felt contrived rather than plausible."}, {"userName": "Wen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2230868-wen", "userReview": "This book is about as the title states the biblical tale of the Exedus. It focuses on the two main ladies in Mosess life. Mirian, his sister and Zipporah his wife. It is told in their points of view and shows how while they would have been very different women from differnt backgrounds become vital to helping Moses complete his task of leading the Jews out of Egypt.
