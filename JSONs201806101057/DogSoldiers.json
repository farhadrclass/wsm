John Converse, a journalist, whose claim to fame is his ability to produce compelling headlines (stories to go with the headlines, well that is where things go haywire), is in Vietnam, but he isn\u2019t really sure why he is still there. His room has been tainted by some maniac American who chased lizards along the walls, crushed them, and left the stain of their residual fluids on the paint. \u201dThere were moral objections to house lizards being senselessly butchered by madmen. Everyone felt these things. Everyone must, or the value of human life would decline. It was important that the value of human life not decline.\u201dHeavy things are going down. He comes up with this rather insane idea to smuggle heroin into the states. With the counter culture dying, LSD and Marijuana are out and heroin is the new beast to chase. \u201dThe pellet with the poison\u2019s in the chalice from the palace, but the flagon with the dragon has the brew that is true.\u201dConverse hires this guy named Ray Hicks, a merchant marine with a penchant for Nietzsche, martial arts, and Zen, to smuggle the heroin into Southern California. Once there Hicks is supposed to hook up with Converse\u2019s wife Marge. Marge is then supposed to turn the heroin over to the distributors. Marge works in an Adult Theater. \u201dShe flashed the mooches\u2019 fingers laboring over their damp half-erections, burrowing in the moldy subsoil of their trousers like arachnids on a decomposing log.\u201d **SHUDDER**She has developed a drug habit while John has been gone. It starts out as a monkey, but grows into an gorilla. \u201dDiluted. Deluded. Dilaudid.Ray is naturally paranoid and believes someone is following him. He is sure that Converse has doubled crossed him. After all he knows that Converse thinks he is...odd. Marge is gliding on the wings of befuddlement and between the two of them they hatch a plan to escape and sell the drugs through other sources. Bad, bad, bad idea. \u201dThe serpent tempting Eve bore a set of carefully rendered rattles.\u201dAnd everyone involved is having more and more trouble distinguishing reality especially after Marge and Ray start sampling the product. Dilaudid is out. Heroin is in. The gorilla starts doing pushups. Converse is trying to explain what has happened to his drug contacts. They are not very happy with him, but what keeps him alive is that they still don\u2019t have the product. As John was leaving Vietnam he could tell that the situation there was about to explode in all new ways. It was becoming a different war, but when he gets back to the States he can tell that things have changed there as well. Crooked cops, crooked lawyers are all getting into the drug pipeline business. He exchanges one war for another war. The new American dream is being able to make one big drug deal. Converse meets the type of client that heroin is tailor made for. \u201cHe sat desiring the girl - a speed-hardened straw-colored junkie stewardess, a spoiled Augustana Lutheran, compounded of airport Muzak and beauty parlor school. Her eyes were fouled with smog and propane spray.\u201dTo follow the line of reason of any one of the characters will take corkscrew dexterity. It is a sordid novel. Readers don\u2019t like these characters and they aren\u2019t supposed to. What you recognize in them that is also in yourself are the very things you like least about yourself. They are weak, greedy, self-centered, and lacking in compassion. They continue to allow themselves to be swept along by events simply because that is easier than swimming for shore. This novel is a time capsule of a period when the last bits of naivety and innocence in America are being exchanged for cynicism and skepticism. It is the dawning of the age of HERE WE ARE NOW, ENTERTAIN US*.* It took until 1991 for Kurt Cobain to explain to us what was going on.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Kirk", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667059-kirk", "userReview": "A few weeks ago I happened to catch the 1978 adaptation of this novel, Who'll Stop the Rain, starring Nick Nolte when he was only, like, 36 instead of 902. The movie made me nostalgic for Robert Stone's original novel, so I found a first edition online for amazingly cheap and re-devoured it in a day. It's a great glimpse into scuzzy America c. 1970---the death of the 60s' cultural revolution, when druggie enlightenment turned into junk dealing and free love degenerated into a trip to the titty bar. We tend to look back on that period now either with sentimental moralizing (American Pastoral) or wacky absurdism (Inherent Vice). But Dog Soliders captures what must have felt like the plunge into the abyss of amorality that the so-called counterculture degenerated into in those scary post-Manson days when some revolutionaries argued with a straight face that the original Chuckie doll was right to slaughter the bourgeoisie (excuse me, \"the pigs\") because---dig, baby---American corruption and hypocrisy was way past redemption. What's perhaps most terrifying about this book is the lack of a moral center. The two main characters, Converse and Hicks, are both corrupt in their own ways, the former a writer scrambling to recapture his gonads by running \"scag\" into the States after a terrifying breakdown on a Nam battlefield, and the latter a self-fashioned zen/samurai merchant marine who in trying moments reaches for his submachine gun to get to nirvana. When Converse asks Hicks to sneak the H to Converse's wife, Marge, all hell breaks loose, and we're introduced to a variety of frightening simulacra of American capitalism. First and foremost, there's Antheil---which on name alone gets Stone massive points for cool. (George Antheil being a 1920s composer). He's a (maybe) narc who deals, dig, and he has two viscious thugs who do his evil bidding. Then there's the phony Hollywood sorts who wanna ride the dragon because it's hip, the drug hustler with the last name \"Peace\" who gets off watching other people getting off (so he can rip em off), and the unfortunate roshi who gets a lead sandwich for believing in transcendence. Take that, zen motherfucker!In the hands of a thriller writer, these would be cartoon characters, but for Stone they become opportunities to plumb philosophical reactions to the problem of \"engage\" (the French noun, not the verb). First and foremost is nihilism, the state of the American soul post-1960s, but also Christian sacrifice and Buddhist poise. If you like your characters well-read and quote-dropping when they beat the shit out of each other (as I do), the dialogue works really well. Plus Hicks is a fairly obvious attempt to assess the legacy of that Holy Fool Neal Cassady (Dean Moriarty of Kerouac fame), whom Stone knew from hanging with the Kesey crowd c. 63-64. If you know how Cassady met his unfortunate demise in 1968, Hick's final march out of the desert of American emptiness (wooshy with smack) will ring excitingly familiar. I would say this is definitely a 70s classic, and probably my fave attempt at a postmortem on the 60s.Which makes the movie all the more frustrating. For contemporary viewers it's probably most interesting for the familiar faces. There's Michael Moriarity, soon of the original Law and Order, as Converse. And the GREAT Anthony Zerbe, previously seen wearing a black hood while taunting Charlton Heston in The Omega Man, as Antheil. Ray Sharkey, a great actor now more famous for denying he had AIDS in the eary 90s, along with Richard Masur, who usually plays the judge or the wussy ex-husband. Unfortunately, the script guts the book, despite the use of a lot of the original dialogue. This is especially unfortuante for Moriarty, who usually goes full metal hambone when he acts (see the cult classic Q, or Quetzalcoatl!). Plus the movie is full of those irritating zooms that no director in the 70s could do without when they had to UNDERSCORE A DRAMATIC MOMENT. Then there's Nolte, who was a gorgeous hunk of raw beef in the day. Too bad he has to go proto-Rambo at the movie's end; he's more fun when he's bitch-sapping Charles Haid (shortly of Hill Street Blues!). So watch the movie only if you're into an endless soundtrack of Creedence Clearweater Revival, which no Vietnam flick can resist, just as no baseball movie can do without \"Centerfield.\" Yea, Fogerty!But if you like tough, uncompromising books about fallen people you wouldn't step within ten feet of, these dogs do hunt."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1219253-amanda", "userReview": "I began this book thinking it would be about the Vietnam War told from the perspective of an in-country reporter named John Converse. I came to find that, while a few early scenes were set in Vietnam and Converse did occasionally reflect on his time spent there, the focus of the book is a drug deal that goes wrong--horribly, horribly wrong. However, I still loved the book. It has a bit of a Pulp Fiction or Guy Ritchie film feel to it. None of the characters are likable people and they have the moral sensibilities of a gnat, but they're entertaining and a reflection of the shifting values embodied by the time period (when asked why he tried to move heroin from Vietnam to the U.S., Converse replies, \"You hear stories over there. They say everybody does it. Being there fucks up your perspective\"). Like most Vietnam novels, Dog Soldiers is liberally sprinkled with black humor for those who can find and appreciate it. I would read the novel all over again just for Converse's remembrance of being fragmentation-bombed in Cambodia--a particularly harrowing and well-written scene of self-realization.

If I step out of line they'll pull me over and that'll be it. (That I've been ticketed twice for bullshit reasons - driving through a one road town with shiny new cop cars for all with out of county plates type of reasons - is neither here nor there. \"It's all over. The game is up!\" What game? Beats me. I'm probably fucking crazy. ) I slow down to the absolute speed limit, turn my music off, grip the steering wheels and total panic in my brain. I don't breathe until they pass me. (Yeah, I have um anxiety problems. I could probably worry about anything if I put my mind to it.) (That it isn't impossible and bad shit happens all of the time is not a mind rester.) I felt something like that reading Dog Soldiers. The game is up and they are coming for me. But I don't know how to play the game!Converse is a former soldier cum writer cum tourist in Vietnam. He feels the fear of the horizon in the back mirrors and the front windows. Cop cars? What the hell humanity can and will do to each other? It's the long view of things. If you look at history books as dates and events it's not about one life, or two, or millions. Who pays for what (anything good anyone has someone paid for it. I like to play history games with myself. Like reading about the suffragettes? I don't think if I was face to face with those women who were beaten and starved in prison for women's right to vote I'd ASK for them to do it. What's worth it for personal reasons, what's not about me)? The fear is also a heat. Heat on your skin to feel alive and consuming all to keep it burning. I've heard this cliche about self mutilation to be about feeling alive. It isn't, exactly. It's letting yourself off the hook and getting feeling bad over with a punishment. It's a kind of freedom, the worst that can happen, the getting over with. I said a kind of freedom! It's the giving in to the worst kind of... yeah, giving up. It sure doesn't feel free. It feels fucking sick. If you can't beat 'em join 'em? That. Drug yourself, give in to the soul numbing horrors of killing fields and bombs. Cry for... what? That's the problem with the long views. It's all burned up. The short views of joining? Fuck. It wasn't hard at all to make it all about me and life in the world now and all the joining them and hoping there is going to be a long view at all. Dog Soldiers is a matter of heart killing of country killing and looking in your window for the cop car 'cause it COULD happen. The big picture is so far beyond my paranoid grasping mental claws. It sure isn't a heat on my skin of feeling alive. Dog Soldiers might've been a big picture book when it came out about America after the Vietnam war. The war on drugs. It might've been one drug bust. Nihilism. Cops came. It could still be now. I read about the fear and sick long and short view of no hope in the world and I recognized THAT as now and future now. It's something to run from? Now. It kinda IS about all of us. It's about us to point the trigger in the mirror like we're taxi driver and cool bravado and sly dialogue and tough outside and soft inside and soft outside and hard inside exterior. Pretending smoke and mirrors, right? Dog Soldiers is a movie. Long view pretend. Paranoia pretend and forgetting what's worth it for who in what you can see in your face as dates and facts. I wish I wasn't so afraid. I wish I wasn't so good at the laughing either. Dog Soldiers made me smirk as well as it made me squirm. I couldn't even think of what else they could have done than to do crack and smuggle drugs and give up. I can see how it could happen (it's not always like that. Just the fearful times). It is tough to be like Converse and the distraction doesn't work. It deadens you enough to not get out."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Relentless and dirty.First published in 1973, Robert Stone\u2019s Dog Soldiers is a hip and groovy but graphic and ugly depiction of a time and a place when our culture, our world was at a crossroads and Stone embraces the suck with the fervor of a Marine at Parris Island.First, Stone describes the scene in language contextually correct for the time. This has the feel and sound of a Dirty Harry film and behind the early 70s prose a reader can almost hear a Lalo Schifrin score grooving out in stacked heels and jiving with a denim jacket and a thick leather belt. We get to know the protagonist, an ostensible journalist in Vietnam who gets involved in a maladroit heroin deal that eventually and inevitably encompasses his family.Secondly, I could not help but compare this fine work, which won the National Book Award for fiction in 1975, with Cormac McCarthy\u2019s 2005 novel No Country for Old Men. Both avoid sympathetic euphemisms and instead boldly and simply illustrate a Boschian landscape of hellish design and consequence. No doubt McCarthy\u2019s work is the more brutal, but Stone\u2019s stark realism and objective sensibility is the more timely chronicle. Finally, in his heavy use of drug depiction and counterculture language, Stone\u2019s voice sounds Hunter Thompson like in its eulogy of the lost optimism of the 60s, looking back as they both do and wistfully long for the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d that is past. Stone never quite lets his narration devolve into the drug induced stream of conscious meanderings of Thompson or of Burroughs, but his style is reminiscent of Beat generation dope mindedness.An important work, certainly, but difficult in many respects, like a regrettable memory as in the words of Galway Kinnell \u201cwe can never be rid of\u201d."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/214053-adam", "userReview": "I always wrote Stone off as a post-Hemingway tough guy writer (which on some levels he is), and really wish someone had slapped me and forced one of his books into my hand. He uses the stark storytelling of Hemingway with the dark forebodings of Conrad and the apocalyptic humor of Nathaniel West. This novel travels through the same anxieties of Pynchon\u2019s Gravity;s Rainbow( with a bag of heroin replacing phallic rocket technology) but with more naturalistic prose, on the edge borderline demented characters in a society seemingly on the edge of exploding into total savagery (whether in Vietnam or California). Lots of allusions to government corruption and the Manson family, this is the novel of the dark heart of early 70\u2019s America, but its concerns seem if not more so, at least as pressing in our new \"merciless age\"(to quote Bowles)."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "Set in the early '70's as the Vietnam War was winding down, Converse (a guy, not a shoe)is supposedly a journalist, but in reality has gone to Vietnam mostly as a tourist. As he gets ready to return home, he gets involved with a deal to smuggle a large quantity of almost pure heroin back into the states, and he has reason to think that the CIA is covertly sponsoring the plan.Converse recruits a former soldier, Hicks, to get the dope back into the States and hand it off to his wife, Marge. Marge is supposed to hand it off to others per arrangments Converse has made. However, once the drugs are in the states, things go wrong, and Hicks and Marge end up on the run from a couple of thugs and a government agent. Converse returns home to find the deal is blown and is soon in desperate trouble himself.Even though most of this book is set in the U.S., it's really about the effect that Vietnam had on America. Once your government has unleashed large scale death and destruction on another country for murky reasons, keeping your own moral compass seems naive. Get what you can, do what you want, and don't worry about the consequences. It explains most of the 1970s. But the book is a cautionary tale about this view. It says that if you go this route, beware. You've bought into the law of the jungle, and there are a lot of predators out there. Just because you think you're ready to live outside the law because you saw some bad shit and think you've jettisoned the conscience that comes with your place in society, that doesn't mean you're ready to deal with the people who never had one to begin with."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/708858-john", "userReview": "Robert Stone, let's all remember, joined his Stanford classmate Ken Kesey & the rest of the Merry Pranksters aboard the LSD-fueled bus \"Further,\" back at the onset of the High Sixties. The experience brought in its richest harvest, however, not in any memoir (though Stone's recent PRIME GREEN makes an admirable effort) but in this piercing & scarifying *noir.* Though first published just as the '60s hallucinations were petering out, DOG SOLDIERS remains the essential depiction of how the dream soured & collapsed, in a swill of broken lives. Certainly Denis Johnson needed this novel to clear the way for the tragic yearning of JESUS' SON, but DOG SOLDIERS has the better imagination & the more full-bodied personalities. Its first episodes play out as a kind of Vietnam dinner-drama, in which the gunfire's offstage & the former Marines Converse & Hicks cast their lots w/ the fallen; they take up smuggling heroin. Converse presents perhaps the most destructive artist figure in a generation of American novels; he says of bringing the scag to San Francisco: \"I feel like this is the first real thing I ever did in my life.\" Yet it's Hicks who's the greater creation, an American samurai saddled w/ a serious love of booze & an inborn commitment to the principles of Zen. Soon after coming ashore in the States, Hicks is spurred to running for his wife w/Converse's wife Marge, a woman w/ rich conflicts of her own, on the one hand a marvelously free & smart definition of marriage -- & motherhood -- on the other an abject determination to get as high as she can. The bad guys come across w/ a matching vividness, in particular the crooked SF detective Antheil (indeed, his Fuhrer is an insect), who w/ his two \"pet rats\" swiftly collar Converse & force him to help w/ tracking & catching Hicks, Marge, & the smack. The scenes of Converse's torture are the most directly presented violence in the book, but the latter half of DOG SOLDIERS puts us through a number of perfectly shocking outbursts, each one a blow between the eyes & yet each rendered the more intense by their moments of indirection, the things the characters can't see. Then too, the worst that happens here all seems necessary, & so they're touched w/ humor (some of the grim one-liners have stayed w/ me for decades now), & enlivened as well w/ an undeniable nobility. The blood & depravity incubate buds of fresh possibility. Stone may demonstrate a broader political vision in the later books, Conradian panoramas like the Central American FLAG FOR SUNRISE or the Jerusalem novel DAMASCUS GATE, but it's this more personal vision that risks most & matters most.

My memories of the early 1970's are that of a child. My parents worked. They provided a nice safe house and I was never cold or hungry. What memories I have of the first part of that decade (outside of my family) are associated with television shows ( The Rookies, Adam-12, Emergency, The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and a few movies. So when I am curious about what was going on in America's soul during that time period I turn to works of fiction - books and movies. Everything from  The Stand  to  Marathon Man  to  The Candidate  and  Taxi Driver .  Dog Soldiers  is one of those touchstones. A look into the drug culture in (almost) Post-Vietnam/Post-Counterculture America. The war was almost over and everyone knew that we had lost. Billions of dollars, 57,000 dead American soldiers, hundreds of thousands Vietnamese dead and injured and a startling realization that America could be kicked in the teeth. Pretty shattering stuff.Meanwhile the idealism of the Flower Era was withering. Drugs had taken over and hard nosed criminals had moved in. The Flower Children wanted their fix and to hell with the flowers. There's more, but that synopsis is enough. Almost everybody was cynical and many had decided that it was time to look out for Number One and maybe make a buck at the same time. The Me Generation was starting to take form. Robert Stone was one of the first writers to see what was going on and to use this dynamic as the background for his novel. It was potent stuff in 1974. A drug fueled, violent, paranoid, cynical story populated by addicts, burned out hippies, corrupt cops, world weary veterans and so on. Everybody was either bought and paid for or was for sell. Because it was the first of it's kind (or one of the first) it was a sensation. The counter-culture novel meets James M. Cain.In 2011 the story has lost some of it's bite. We've seen it done since on bigger stages with bigger budgets. Filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino have taken this genre and ran with it. Movies like  Pulp Fiction ,  Thursday , Savages and even  Smokin Aces  are influenced by Stone's work - if not outright copies. So to a younger reader the story might feel dated and smaller than life. I don't see it that way. This is a strange and vivid novel. The off kilter feeling is correct. Drugs alter one's senses. The world of the criminal is a dysfunctional one at best. I like the mix of drug haze, violence and burned out cynical America. It might not seem that fresh and cutting edge nowadays, but it still gives you a strong feeling for what was going on in America in the first half of the 1970's."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446219-jessica", "userReview": "This is one of those books from the 70s where every conversation they have you know that they're really talking about something else, something much deeper and more profound than what they're saying on the surface, but you have no idea what it is.

It's the same for me with Naked Lunch or On the Road, although those books were much earlier, before the fall of said counterculture.

Converse, a journalist living in Vietnam, agrees to take part in a drug deal after deciding that the world is basically corrupted. He employs his friend Hicks to smuggle the Heroin into America and hand it off to his wife, Marge. Unfortunately someone is already on to them. When Hicks tries to hand the drugs off to Marge they are intercepted by two henchman, but escape. The rest of the novel follows them while they're on the run from these somewhat unexplained assailants. Meanwhile, these same men find Converse, who has returned to the US, and force him to try to make Hicks and Marge turn over the drugs by threat of death. All these characters are flawed, they all have problems and most are depressed and/or junkies. Their motives are unclear and hard to understand as is their message. It is barely explained until the end who these men that are chasing Hicks and Marge are until the end. This book was highly praised at the time of its release, but since then seems to have faded away. It was pretty hard to find, in the entire LA public library system there is only one available copy.

America IS Vietnam, man.) Maybe at some point in the past it was considered brilliant to have your characters more or less look into the camera and start riffing on the decline of the U.S. in the post-war era; I doubt it impressed a lot of readers in the 70s, it sure made me roll my eyes at several points. This is fundamentally a thriller that I think Stone tried to make 'literary' just by adding some pungent social commentary to. Instead he ends up with a sort-of-thriller where the characters just seem to do an awful lot of shallow whining about obliquely hinted at social changes while getting shunted from one plot-point to the next.This was published a year after Thomas Pynchon's 'Gravity's Rainbow' and a year before William Gaddis's 'JR' (both of which, along with Dog Soliders, won the national book award in their respective years), both of those books are massive, massively rich stylistic fugues which helped push our idea of what the the novel is and can do into extreme, new directions. I like plot driven books, and I enjoy social realism, and its not really fair to compare what Stone does to what Pynchon and Gaddis do. But my point is that even by the standards of other big-name works of its age, Dog Soldiers is a pretty bland mediocrity."}, {"userName": "Kurt Reichenbaugh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3797062-kurt-reichenbaugh", "userReview": "Were Americans ever really naive or is that just something common myth tries to convince us of. Personally, I don't think so. The 60's is a duplicitous reflection of history that depends on where it was one stood at the time. Were you in the back of the bus, in Stanford or Harvard, at Woodstock, or in a POW camp? I was a child of the 70's and I'll be the first to admit that my mind used to go into \"shutdown\" mode whenever some older suburbanite started waxing poetic about what a free spirit they were in the sixties, especially when I know they voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush while bopping their head to the umpteenth playing of \"Summer in the City\" by the Lovin' Spoonful on KOOL FM. So we have this novel that is deemed by critics to be an allegory for the waning sixties. Or really, was that Robert Stone's intention? Clearly it's a product of experiences in the USA as he knew them. My recollection of the 70's is television, skateboards and school. Oh yeah, and sports and part-time work at Winn Dixie and girls and pot and going to movies. I was sheltered from the ugliness of the world mostly, given that ugliness still seeped into the 'burbs in spite of our parents' best and failed efforts. So this book is a look at a time and place involving a couple of young wasted lives pursuing a fool's dream involving heroin. The deck is stacked against them, as it is for most of us in this crazy country of movies, and music and jingoism. You want to read a good and sordid book about drugs and dreams, then this is one for you. I liked it. I probably read it at the right time in life.

Had this been indeed true, then 1973 would have been a terrible year for books. \"Dog Soldiers\" is just a complex and competent thriller, with some nuggets of social observation thrown in to make it appear wise and deep. 1973, Saigon. Vietnam war is winding down. The main characters are John Converse, a low-level journalist and an aspiring writer, his wife, Marge, and an American soldier, Ray Hicks, who is a sort of Converse's friend. Converse has Hicks smuggle a large package of heroin from Vietnam into California. The bulk of the plot describes attempts of numerous bad characters to get that package in various California locations. The action-filled plot is interesting, yet, especially towards the end, totally implausible.I have serious reservations as to Mr. Stone's writing. The dialogues in the first part of the novel are jarringly unnatural. One can eventually get accustomed to less than stellar dialogues and towards the end they read almost fine. Only Marge and Ray feel like real people, Converse is close but does not quite make it, and the bad guys and some women characters are just caricatures. There are some nicely drawn minor players, though. It has taken me such a long time to get through the book as I had to force myself to continue reading.Most characters, while being drunk to the gills, are constantly high on heroin, dilaudid, and other drugs, including hallucinogenic mushrooms. They talk in a rather highbrow language (\"Let smiles cease, let laughter flee\") and conduct bombastic philosophical discussions on the deeper issues of the nature of being, even while being tortured or while dying. All this is rather silly. Maybe it was considered innovative in 1973, but I read deeper books that involved addiction, which had been written much earlier (as an example, Malcolm Lowry's \"Under the Volcano\", published in 1947).The greatest sin of the novel is its pretentiousness. Mr. Stone uses Big Words to write about Big Issues. More talented writers can write about big issues using small words.What saves \"Dog Soldiers\" from a two-star rating is an adept portrayal of the insanity and horrors of war and of the societal breakdown caused by the war. The slow death of the hippie era is shown well. Also, while the bulk of the plot in the last third of the book is preposterous, the very last four of five pages provide a wonderfully nasty closing to the plot.Two and three quarter stars."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/531153-jonathan", "userReview": "Enjoyable, but did not really get under my skin."}, {"userName": "Eve Kay", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42098789-eve-kay", "userReview": "[I guess there was something special about Hicks, maybe I saw him through Marge's eyes, I don't know.

On one hand, Dog Soldiers is not really about Vietnam- we only spend 50-60 pages there- but Vietnam is always in the background, as it was in A Flag for Sunrise, the other novel of Stone's I've read. The experience of being there changes his characters forever. As one of them thinks after watching US pilots mow down elephants that were ostensibly being used by the North Vietnamese to carry supplies, a variety of the dissonance that I think just about all of us uneasily live with these days, \"if the world is going to contain elephants pursued by flying men, people are just naturally going to want to get high.\"This character is John Converse, a journalist who goes to Vietnam with the aspiration of writing something about the war, but ends up agreeing to help \"move\" three kilos of heroin after they've been smuggled back to the US by an old military buddy/acquaintance/Nietzsche and Buddhism enthusiast/psychopath (?) named Ray Hicks. Stone demonstrates that at the moment of decision, and in the presence of an attractive woman, John's psychological need to act boldly seems more significant than moral or legal questions. Such things happen in life. John's wife, Marge, samples the product, develops a habit, and disappears with Ray. When John gets back to the US, a couple of unsavory 'regulatory agents' pick up John's trail and torture him (kitchens can be extremely dangerous places) into helping them. That's the plot, basically, and it's a pretty suspenseful one. John and Marge both seem archetypal, representative of a passage from idealism to nihilism; John at first believes that he can write something meaningful about the madness of the war, and Marge seems representative of people who tried LSD or mushrooms for the purpose of self-discovery or -improvement. But it turns out that war and hard drugs are things that cannot simply be utilized, channeled, and walked away from. In this novel, both roads end in the escapism of heroin. Stone writes convincingly about drugs, but not like someone who is heavily into them. I doubt there's any causal relationship, but his name is appropriate to his writing style- realistic, very much of the physical world and true to the way people speak. His characters tend to be stoic about their desperate lives. They take drugs, but we don't go on their trips with them- unlike, say, Burroughs or Pynchon, Stone doesn't try to mimic the experience. His writing is not out-of-this-world, not on the level of, say, Michael Herr, but...solid, like a stone. One of the minor characters in Dog Soldiers, an older journalist, asks Converse about Vietnam, and tells him, \"but you went, that's the important thing\", before reminiscing about his time fighting in the Spanish Civil War. But why is it the important thing? Part of what makes Stone's characters' relationship with Vietnam so complicated and interesting is the nature of their ambivalence towards it. They're not naive, and they generally don't get off on killing. And while they can never really get away from Vietnam, they also feel a strange nostalgia for it- as if they miss the most meaningful years of their lives, and they know that whatever comes next will never be able to match them. A tempting response might be to find a powerful enough form of escape and ride with it until the end, but the irony is that the existence of Stone's novel belies the tragic viewpoint he expresses so well- or it at least demonstrates that certain forms of escape are less harmful than others."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37256808-tim", "userReview": "This was one of the toughest, liveliest, most biting things I have ever read - real, funny, and sharp. Stone writes in the Hemingway style - short, clear sentences, terse and direct. But he is no Hemingway as far as his concerns go, althou the macho content of his writing is reasonably high. He is interested in moral and emotional ambiguity, greed, toughness, and some of the stranger conflicts that can occur between men and men, and men and women.The story follows a small-time journalist named Converse who attempts to smuggle a big load of heroin out of Vietnam and into California during the Vietnam War era. The descriptions of life in Vietnam at the beginning of the book give a vivid sense of what things must have been like in that war-whipped land. Converse enlists the help of an old friend named Ray Hicks, a naval officer who does the actual smuggling. But when Hicks reaches San Francisco, things start going very wrong. SPOILER ALERTA couple of scumbag hustlers, claiming to be narcotics cops, accost Hicks and try to get his dope away from him. He and Converse's wife Marge end up on the lam and in the sack together, trying to get rid of a big bag of heroin. They go to L.A. where they meet Eddie Peace, a slick operator who introduces them to some dilettante preppies who want to dabble in drugs. Things go very wrong again and they set out for the desert, Marge now fully hooked on smack. Converse meanwhile comes back, and despite a little help from his left wing father-in-law, is accosted and tortured by the same creeps Hicks had to deal with. They turn out to be affiliated with some sort of federal agent named Antheil. These guys force Converse to accompany them to a showdown with Hicks and Marge at the mountain top retreat of an alcoholic, and rather ineffective holy man named Dieter. In the end, Converse and Marge are left standing, Hicks is dead, and the dope is in the hands of the crooked federal agent and his accomplice, the woman who set up the dope deal in the first place.This is good, red-blooded adventure, but it is also full of trenchant satire on various aspects of the 1965-1973 counterculture era: the supercool behavior, the drug scene, the spiritual side of it, the criminal elements, and the guiltless, unattached sex.

Read on with caution.*Dog Soldiers, by Robert Stone, is yet another fantastic novel, smart and engaging. At the center of the story is a bag of three kilograms of heroin that John Converse, a war correspondent in Vietnam, has smuggled into San Francisco near the end of the war. The smuggler, Ray Hicks, is an old friend of Converse\u2019s in the Merchant Marines. From the moment Hicks arrives in the States, a group of men know what he is carrying and are trying their level best to get it from him even as he tries to deliver the package to Marge, Converse\u2019s wife, who is supposed to pay Hicks for his labors. Hicks and Marge go on the lam in order to find a profitable way to offload the drugs, while Antheil, an \u201cagent,\u201d and his two thugs, Danskin and Smitty, pursue them. Converse returns home, is seized by Antheil\u2019s men, and is brought along as a bargaining chip in retrieving the heroin. The novel culminates in the wilds of southeastern California in the home of Dieter Bechstein, an old friend of Hicks\u2019s and an erstwhile cult leader who no longer has a following.The theme behind all this action is corruption. Everyone in the novel is corrupted. Converse and Marge have become drug dealers. Marge\u2019s father deals in \u201cnews\u201d items that are entirely fictitious. Converse\u2019s correspondences from Vietnam are designed to invoke feelings that are antithetical to those Converse actually felt. Antheil is a federal agent who has gone rogue. Danskin is a psychopath full of rage and destruction. And of course, all the mistakes and errors surround a large stash of heroin, an easy enough symbol for corruption. But the corruption with which Stone is concerned is not a moral corruption. This is not a book that holds up drug use for scorn\u2014Stone is absolutely neutral when discussing Marge\u2019s habit. While he is clearly critical of Converse, it is not his attempt to become a drug dealer that is disappointing. The corruption that Stone has fixed his eye on is a spiritual corruption.For a headnote to the novel, Stone chose this passage from Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the devil of violence and the devil of greed and the devil of hot desire; but, by all the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils that swayed and drove men\u2014men, I tell you. But as I stood on that hillside, I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land, I would become acquainted with a flabby, pretending weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly.\u201d It is hard to re-read this quote after finishing the novel and not see the hillside of the climax as the subject of the quote. What is disgusting to Stone is not the \u201cstrong, lusty, red-eyed devils\u201d but the \u201cflabby pretending weak-eyed devil.\u201d The characters in the novel are not fighting over anything of real substance, of meaning; they are fighting instead over heroin, or worse yet, the money that the heroin can be cashed in for. What a sad motivator for all the violence and bloodshed. The shame is not that so much blood has been spilt, but that so much blood has been spilt for something so meaningless. Instead of searching for the dope, these characters should have been on a spiritual journey, Drug use in the 1970s had a very different cultural meaning than drug use in the 1960s. In the \u201860s, there was a feeling of experimentation and a belief that mind-altering drugs might give the user access to new levels of perception and understanding. All such idealism was dead or at least twitching in the corner by the mid \u201870s. Marge is stoned for most of the novel, but her reason for shooting up is always to dull the pain and panic. She is always running away from something through her drugs, not searching for something meaningful. But the real character to pay attention to where drugs are concerned is Dieter. When Dieter originally setup his commune on the hill, everything was good: \u201cInnocence. Energy. I believed it so much that for a while it came true for me. . . . Marvelous things happened to us. We were levitating, we were delirious.\u201d He says that it all went south when he \u201csuccumbed to the American dream\u201d: \u201cThen it occurred to me that if I applied the American style\u2014which I didn\u2019t really understand\u2014if I pushed a little, speeded things up a little, we might break into something really cosmic. . . . So I thought, a little push, a little shove, a little something extra to shake it loose. And I ended up as Doctor Dope.\u201d In his desire to get to the truly transcendental plain, Dieter turned to drugs, nothing new in the \u201860s. The outcome, however, was not the cosmic shift he hoped for, but the destruction of the commune and everyone in it. Drugs prove to be a detour away from self-discovery, not a path towards it, and Dieter loses everything that is important. That, for Stone, is the true problem with heroin and other drugs.Dieter\u2019s final moments are used up trying to convince Hicks to throw the dope away, to convince him that dope is a distraction. Instead, Hicks is obsessed with the heroin, even though we never see him use it. He\u2019s certainly an addict, but not to the drug in his veins. Something else in him cares so deeply about the heroin that he returns to fetch it at the end instead of escaping while he can with Converse and Marge. Nor is it a convincing argument to say that he cares about the money that it will fetch since we never see Hicks think about money at all. It\u2019s almost as if he wants the drugs as a thing unto itself, which is exactly what Hicks thinks to himself while in his delirious state at the end of the novel: \u201cwithout the pack, things would be much easier. He recalled that the pack was what he wanted so he would have to carry it. Serious people existed in order to want things, and to carry them.\u201d While Hicks reads philosophy and dabbles in Eastern religions, whatever self examination Hicks once engaged in is long gone. He has defined himself as a type of samurai, a serious survivor with an honorable code, but the hollowness of that image is exposed in his definition of \u201cserious people.\u201d That is the very picture of spiritual dryness, as dry as the desert through which Hicks finally meets his death.It is a solid novel with fantastic characters and some wonderful scenes. The scenes with Danskin and Smitty are really gripping, especially once they are traveling with Converse. I was surprised by the depth of these characters, especially given how unpleasant they were. In fact, it seems to me that Stone much prefers the characters who are thoroughly rotten to those who come closest to being \u201cgood.\u201d Hicks and Marge, while interesting in their way, especially before they meet, are rather flat characters. For being a quick read, Dog Soldiers is also a meaty book with as much to think about as you care to find. It can be a simple chase with drugs and guns, or it can be an exploration of spiritual dryness in America in the 1970s. I\u2019m sure there is still more to pull from the novel, but you'll have to help me with that."}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12529549-ted", "userReview": "A drug deal gone bad, lots of guns and violence is usually fodder for a good novel.

It has the rhythm of a bloody heist thriller, but the language that describes this action is filled with strange, psychedelic imagery. Towards the last section of the novel (and no, this isn't a \"spoiler\") a raging battle in Mexico is followed by a chapter devoted to rambling inner-monologue. This is an example of the two-faced nature of Dogs Soldiers.John Converse, a writer who has grown tired from working in a bizarre pirate newspaper, starts a career of freelance journalism in Vietnam. He roams around the deadly landscape, sometimes visits jungle battle-lines, and even makes it to frayed Cambodia. Torpid to the bone, before he is shipped back to California he launches a reckless smack deal. I won't elaborate on the plotline any further, but the colors darken, as you would imagine, into a canvas of chaotic violence.Amongst the warped main characters (John, his cheating wife Maggie and his friend Ray Hicks, played by Nick Nolte in the film version) flows a sea of caricatures. Psychotic FBI narcs, Samoan thugs, false Messiahs; loonies with names like K-Jell, Holy O and Smitty. So if your cup of tea is something like a chamber play, where the author focuses on three or four main figures, you might dismiss this book. If you are generally fond of two distinct genres \u2013 gloomy satire and strong suspense \u2013 \"Dog Soldiers\" and most books by Robert Stone should leave you more than satisfied. Raskin, one of the many corrupt hooligans, is the roundest supporting player in the book. He is colder, more vigilant than the other stoned misfits. At one point he delivers a monologue explaining the roots of his rotten ways; an involuntary commitment to a Brooklyn psych ward, a facility for the criminally insane where he spent the entire 1960's. This book is full of these brief subplots. These detours from the immediate storyline, while seemingly distracting and insignificant, are written so well that they're worth the lingering.I would like to add that the film version (titled \"Who'll Stop the Rain\") isn't as great; even the late Robert Stone wasn't a fan. The 1998 Gulf War movie \"Three Kings\" is unrelated to Dog Soldiers but seems to capture the vibe Stone was going for in a better fashion.\"Dog Soldiers\" is a strange bird, but it's a bit more down to earth than most of the famous postmodern books. And as Stone himself was a journalist in Saigon, authenticity can be found; as crazy as the book gets, it always, disturbingly, rings true.
