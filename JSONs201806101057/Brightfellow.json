Kudos to both Rikki Ducornet and Coffeehouse Press! (And thanks to the latter for my review copy.)Read my entire review at Expendable Mudge Muses Aloud, or as I call it \"my blog.\" Comme d'habitude, I shall post the entire review here in a few weeks' time for the click-a-phobic amongst us."}, {"userName": "Anthony Vacca", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27183668-anthony-vacca", "userReview": "In no way resembling the last great album opener by David Bowie, \"Blackstar\" (besides being a compound word beginning with the second letter of the alphabet), Rikki's most recent novel is a slightly tamer experience than what may be expected by lovers of her effervescent fantasia, The Jade Cabinet; or of the grungy and erotic excesses of her fairy tale, The Stain; or of the sublime minimalism of her psychological Pandora's box, Netsuke; or the verbose splendor of her championing of the unshackled imagination, The Fan-Maker's Inquisition: A Novel of the Marquis de Sade. But Brightfellow is still such a pleasure of words, even if it feels like a minor curiosity in Rikki's oeuvre of fantastical fictions. There are many delights to be had in this breezy sequence of snapshots concerning a young misfit's clandestine education among the dusty stacks of a campus library and the domestic dust-ups of the boozy faculty's backyard bbqs. Mild child stalking and an unsettling, tragic denouement keeps this fleeting little novel from settling too comfortably into the realm of whimsy. And, Rikki, I'm sorry that someone slapped this awful coverart on your lively book."}, {"userName": "Scribble Orca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4402387-scribble-orca", "userReview": "Contrary to the effulgent review here, less a brightfellow than something of a banalfr\u00e8re.The language is almost entirely devoid of Ducornet's usual vivaciousness. She continues the arc of themes present in much of her earlier work, in particular parallelling The Fountains of Neptune, and includes the by-now ubiquitous figure of duty-derelict damaged mother and remote father as the protagonist's raison de faire, along with a supporting cast offering something of redemption. Ducornet's preoccupation with these archetypes suggests a Fraudian interpretation.Worthy of reading, but not the crowning achievement of Ducornet's brilliant career."}, {"userName": "Nathan \"N.R.\" Gaddis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7607437-nathan-n-r-gaddis", "userReview": "At any rate, here's Rikki on the Radio ::http://www.davidnaimon.com/2016/07/20... ______________\"Like an unbounded baron in the trees, like a goat boy on the loose in the groves of academe...\" --Michael MartoneNow that's a lesson in blurb writing."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141982-jim", "userReview": "I read Brightfellow without really meaning to. I was reading The Deep Zoo, a short collection of Ducornet's nonfiction that feels like the skeleton key to her imagination, and wasn't ready to let her voice go. (If you know her work you know what I mean.) Brightfellow is a fever dream of a novel that reads like a fairy tale: feral children, evil stepmothers, goodly benefactors, false identities, reclusive writers, and a college campus that feels like a cabinet of curiosities erected out of the fantasy of the author's youth. One doesn't read Ducornet: one inhabits her imagination. Tonight I combed through my bookshelves looking for another one of her books to read and I opened her first novel, Catching Fire, which she'd signed for me at a conference in 2002 and decorated with a sketch of a piece of fruit, sliced open, fertile with seeds."}, {"userName": "Cody", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48027559-cody", "userReview": "Sad to say, this largely didn\u2019t work for me (I know this is world-ending, but something tells me that you will find a way to continue on). There\u2019s nothing bad about it by any means, it is just the first book I have read by Ducornet that seems insubstantial. Perhaps undercooked would be a better, if far more pretentious, way to put it. In Brightfellow, we meet not characters but sketches thereof; barrenscapes that RD would\u2019ve normally smeared with some voodoo goo to wonderous, animating effect. As it stands, it reads like a fairy tale that can\u2019t decide which way it wants to go and as a result ends up going pretty much nowhere.And another thing: it is too cute by half. The fucking names made me want to roll my eyes back in my head (and, indeed, sometimes did\u2014one more Verner Vanderloon and I would\u2019ve had to finish reading the fucking thing held above mid-skull). Between Verner, Asthma, and Pea Pod alone, you have a rogue\u2019s gallery of phoned-in names. But then, oh yes, who arrives but fucking Santa! (Not of Clan Clause, but still.) Meh, I\u2019m a grumpy bastard who enjoys watching videos of kids\u2019 Jenga towers falling over so grain/salt.Verdict: Ducornet commuted for life for the books of hers I read on either side of this small misstep, masterpieces both. Sentence: shoot the cover artist at Coffee House Press in the face with small arms at close quarters. *One more goddamn thing: whoever wrote the synopsis on the back really needs to look up the definition of the word \u2018feral,\u2019 because Stub/Charter ain\u2019t it."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh", "userReview": "Rikki, you're a creepy mofo.

Alone, Stub manages to infiltrate a nearby college campus, and begins to live as a student, but is constantly aware of his \"other\" status. When presented with the reality of a surrogate home, he struggles to accept it. Amid his confusion, he mistakes dark clouds of obsession for comfort. Beautifully done, Brightfellow is a tiny, but surprisingly complex, gem."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4081664-jessica", "userReview": "A slim little book that somehow beguiled me into taking it home. And once I opened the cover, I was enchanted; how many stories begin with \"The linoleum swells with stories.\"? And then we meet Stub, a small child, all alone with his thoughts, with his incredible capacity for creating worlds where the rest of us only see the pedantic properties of everyday life. He lives a solitary existence in a tiny rural cabin with his mother and dad. Neither seems to pay him much mind, and so his unschooling continues, rising within his wildfire imaginative mind and sent soaring through a combination of curiosity and little understood desperation. Time passes; circumstances change and for a short time Stub finds camaraderie with his caretaker, Jenny, but it doesn't last (although her personal obsession with the literary work of reclusive genius Verner Vanderloon will take root in Stub's own mind), and he soon strikes out in his own, embracing the campus of a small nearby college as his own. Stub's adventures there I'll leave for you to discover, but know that Ducornet imbues the world of this lonely Peter Pan man-child with an evanescent and lyrical beauty. As Stub cautiously flits in and out of the school faculty's social circle, he finds wonder, love, confusion and disenchantment from unexpected corners. Although this little volume fills only 143 small pages, it exemplifies Salman Rushdie's adage: \"To understand one person, you must swallow the world.\" The bright innocence of Stub's persona lands in your lap without warning time and again, and his ruminations on an number of topics, from the soul: \"They say...they say we each have a bird within us. A bird of breath, a bird of fire. Longing for...release...\" to loss of innocence: \"It's as if he has seen angels tearing off one another's wings...\" will leave you satisfied that art and creativity continue to pilot our peculiar human existence. Ducornet's biggest achievement, though, is that she manages to deliver this work without succumbing to pretension or preciousness. Truly a must read for anyone interested in ripe characters, a bit of introspection, or struggling with the privilege and pain of writing. It's a little Holy wafer on the tongue of your overwhelming everyday life."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/901034-nick", "userReview": "As an incredulous reader of prose-poetry, Ducornet's popping, fluid style delighted me.

Abandoned by his parents as a child, Stub moves onto the local college campus where he takes refuge in utilities closets and abandoned library storage rooms. Among the stacks of forgotten books, Stub educates himself on the writings of obscure philosopher Verner Vanderloon, who is also a recluse. A widowed professor eventually takes Stub in, while Stub, who has renamed himself Charter, poses as an exchange student from Australia. From the window of his new lodgings, Charter becomes fascinated by Asthma, a young girl who lives next door, and he attempts to remake his lost childhood through her. Brimming with lyrical descriptions of the campus and with ornamental characters representing various academic \u201ctypes,\u201d Brightfellow is both a portrait of small town campus life and of the peculiarities of childhood. Ducornet\u2019s vision of childhood, despite being idiosyncratic, is quite appealing: a world free of restrictive adults where self-learning is the prerogative. As a first time Ducornet reader, this short, brisk novel was a welcome introduction to her writing.This review first appeared on my blog: http://buriedwomenwriters.com/2016/10..."}, {"userName": "Fred", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred", "userReview": "I've made no secret of my admiration for Ducornet's writing. Of her novels, no two lend themselves to close stylistic- or even thematic- comparisons outside of the fact that each is brilliant and unique. For readers who prize formulaic story constructs, Ducornet will not appeal. And the same goes for those readers who enjoy retreaded stories that are \"gussied up\" (my grandmother's term) for a modern retelling.This particular novel is quite subtle in it's achievement. Sublime is an apt description, and not one that I would normally apply to any writing. Here, the aptly named Stub reinvents himself in a most unconventional manner following a largely neglected childhood. Once on his feet, his platonic fixation with a neighborhood child dissolves his hold on reality as the relationship sours.This story is tragic, poetic, unsettling, and artistically satisfying all at once."}, {"userName": "Janette Mcmahon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5406525-janette-mcmahon", "userReview": "Isolation, loneliness, and obsession control this short novel by Ducornet. Who are we if we have no strong identity? Can we be whomever we want to be, create a subterfuge that every one believes, even yourself? When do we cross the line from curious about a life we want to have to a creepy young man with mental issues?

I fell in love with Stub and, in my dreams, I have to believe that he found a quality life in the end. I was given a number of reminders of the parent and person I really hope to be, one day.A few lines of beauty:\"The library space, if airless, is an oasis of privacy and peace.\"\"Sometimes I think that had it all started out differently, I might have taken the world by storm rather than exhausting myself slinking about, purloining soap and other people's galoshes.\"\"I am, as are all men: mindful, artful, perceptive, creative - and an animal. Determined to survive, to sleep in safety and not go hungry. I imagine that my chosen life says something about other men, about man's nature. And in spite of all these digressions I am leaning toward greater things. Capable of greatness. What if my life is not only the mirror of my own thwarted destiny, or the mirror of mankind's thwarted destiny, but the mirror of my species capacity to overcome the worst odds?\"\"Parrots, I have noticed, are the popular pets with narcissists.\"\"The world is a civilized place, if only I remember.\"\"Vanderloon divides mankind into two constants: the ones who know how to play, are full of mirth and fellow feelings, and the ones who are killjoys and combustible. Play, he writes, is a powerful form of magic - sometimes white, sometimes black. But always it is born of invention and intuition. Play us about becoming human, just as it is also about becoming a lion, a tugboat, a galloping stallion. The hallways that leads away from the child's room and into the depths of the house is a river, a glacier, a bridge to the moon.\""}, {"userName": "Briar Woolfe", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60251753-briar-woolfe", "userReview": "The characters were like an extension of a dream, somewhat swollen inside something I wanted to itch but I couldn't figure out.
