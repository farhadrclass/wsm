Even after Lenin and his allies seized the reins of government in Moscow and Leningrad late in the year, the Communist Party\u2019s control of the country was deeply in doubt. The party was indebted to a shaky coalition partner, the Left Revolutionary Socialists. Royalist forces, later dubbed the Whites, were forming armies led by former czarist officers and rapidly regaining territory. A Czech army of 50-100,000 men was operating in tandem with the Whites. And the Western Allies\u2014British, French, and Americans\u2014were invading the country from the north. Chaos reigned in Russia.In the midst of this fluid and uncertain situation, Jack McColl, a Scot employed by the nascent Secret Service (MI6), enters the country on a mission to help undermine the Bolsheviks. Meanwhile, his unlikely lover, Irish-American journalist Caitlin Handley, is in Russia reporting on the Revolution. Caitlin is a radical with friends among the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. This is the premise on which Lenin\u2019s Roller Coaster is based. It\u2019s the third novel in David Downing\u2019s series featuring Jack and Caitlin.Somehow, in an earlier book in the series, the two fell in love in the midst of a Secret Service operation in Ireland. There, they were on different sides, too. In fact, Jack was responsible for the death of Caitlin\u2019s younger brother, Colm, who \u201chad been hanged in the Tower of London two years earlier, after taking part in an Irish Republican plot to sabotage the transporting of British troops to France. McColl had caught and arrested him, albeit after offering to let him escape.\u201d Improbably, Caitlin is well aware of Jack\u2019s role in Colm\u2019s death and fell in love with him, anyway.Mansfield Cumming (the original \u201cC\u201d of MI6) has sent Jack to Russia with vague orders to connect with other agents already in place there. Cumming explains, \u201cOur job is to shore up what\u2019s left of the Eastern Front and prevent the Germans and Turks from exploiting the Russian collapse.\u201dLenin\u2019s Roller Coaster relates Jack and Caitlin\u2019s experiences as they make their way to Moscow with painful slowness. Jack enters from the south, through Iran. Caitlin\u2019s route takes her to Vladivostok on Russia\u2019s easternmost coast, then westward on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Both trips take many weeks and expose the lovers to repeated danger. While Downing\u2019s description of the Russian Revolution as it unfolded across the vast expanse of the country is fascinating from an historical standpoint, the slow progression of the plot is tedious. The book works well as historical fiction, not so well as a thriller."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/644867-alexandra", "userReview": "The story didn't do much to captivate me but the historical detail was illuminating."}, {"userName": "Lorin Cary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2458009-lorin-cary", "userReview": "This is an historical novel, and Downing explains at the end his take on that genre. It's an excellent explanation which fits the story he's crafted that takes places during the first year of the Russian revolution. Jack McColl is a Scotsman and a British secret agent and Caitlin Hanley is an Irish-American journalist and supporter of the Bolsheviks. And of course they are in love. The novel follows them in separate chapters as Jack gets to Russia and as Caitlin works to record history-in-the-making and then to become part of it. Downing captures the context beautifully, the fragility of the regime in that first year, as myriad forces work to crush the revolution, and as the terror-to-come showed some ragged edges. It's a powerful story, and an excellent read."}, {"userName": "Martha Nance", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36770830-martha-nance", "userReview": "3.5, not quite a 4, but still a good read.

Most of it happens in 1917 Russia after the Bolsheviks have seized power. Many fellow reviewers had problems with it as being too complex or too favorable to the Bolsheviks in their struggle against the Whites. I think much of that is because Russian history at this particular time was extremely complex and Downing caught the complexity. The apparent sympathy for the Bolsheviks was true of many at that particular time as many contemporary observers thought it would unleash a new and better world. Plus the Whites against whom they were pitted were equally vile--especially against Jews. At this time many people/especially artists traveled to Russia to develop art and it was considered an exciting period of free expression. I suspect by the next volume those positive vibes will turn to dust as they have started in that direction towards the end of this one."}, {"userName": "Robert Scott", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43101170-robert-scott", "userReview": "+McColl is left a home when Caitlin Hanley returns to Russia, but then he ships east with a partner to try to keep the Germans from obtaining essential materials.

Train service is often interrupted or stopped all together and the trip to Moscow is not without incident. Meanwhile Jack is making his way through German occupied territory on his way to Kiev and befriends an orphaned boy after his escape from Kiev. Lots of walking, train problems, imprisonment by different groups, a split of the bolsheviks with the LSR, all manner of problems and ethical and other challenges to belief systems.

The main story is told at the ground level from an American reporter's point of view. The writing is pretty easy to read and follow. The characters are quite well done and pleasant. The reason I only gave it 2 stars as I found it a bit unfocused. I thought the story followed too many people around. There were a lot of other things going on, things that took away from one main plot line. Maybe the author thought many characters and events added to the story or enhanced it but I thought these other happenings were too long winded.
