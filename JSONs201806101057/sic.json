Check it out for more reviews! Every once in a while, a book comes along that transcends simple story telling. These books leave a lasting impression, giving you the thoughts and the ability to make positive changes to your life. [sic] is one such book, about a group of teenagers who want to break free from the normal constraints of life. They play a compelling game called Eureka and the rules are simple. Once they are tagged, they have 15 minutes to change their life, in whichever way they choose.Jacob Thorke, a relatively poor teen living in the trailer park, has been pulled in for questioning of the death of his friend, David Bloom. As he slowly recalls the past few years of his life, we find out how Eureka started and the addictive nature of the game. David Bloom is akin to a cultist leader, with magnetism and energy to capture the heart of his group. Without the usual constraints and social norms, these teenagers would do anything to gain David's approval. From arson, to giving their car away, losing their virginity and starting fights, we learn that Eureka is a scary game to play, no matter how life changing it may be.I was really impressed with [sic] from the get go. While it's less 'murder mystery' as the blurb may suggest and more realistic fiction, seeing these teens equipped with Eureka and what they did was really interesting. Eureka removes all the fear in doing things that you think would get you into trouble, for hopes of bettering your life. From the righteous Jacob, to the psychotic and beautiful Emily, to crazy Steven, these teenagers are off the hook. The only thing balancing out their craziness is Nora, the on and off again girlfriend of Jacobs who questions his loyalty to the game.The writing has its moments of beauty, kind of like a rough diamond. Its simply to convey what Jacob thinks about his own life, and it's really easy to fall into.[sic] is a simple yet powerful tale about the possibilities of life if you break free from constraints. It's about the freedom to act out your wishes to achieve your dreams, but the flipside is the consequences of these actions can be scary. What would you do if you had 15 minutes to change your life? This book makes you think about those possibilities, and what's holding you back.I received a review copy from the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Christine D.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4410450-christine-d", "userReview": "I never knew that 170 pages could capture me the way [sic] did. The philosophy in it is powerful, and will hopefully give young adults a book that is more than mushy romance and superficial lifestyles. The plot has a great impact, as readers observe the lives of teenager pariahs. Initially they have no meaning in their lives. Of course, that is before Eureka - before David (Eureka's creator) seizes their hearts and creates a cult. He becomes their Jesus.I cannot deny the originality of the plot. It is nothing like I have read before. There is no book, no movie that can compare to [sic]. This made the plot so refreshing. I was walking on unfamiliar territory, and there was no predictability. With such a radical game introduced early in the novel, the plot gains momentum. I even found that my reading pace increased because I anticipated what the tagged character (\"It\") would do. Better yet, with each Eureka play the novel intensifies as each move is more bizarre than the last - sometimes even life-threatening. Being a source of empowerment for the tagged, Eureka eventually becomes the sole motivation of each main character. Though it does take up most of the plot, this game (which makes Truth and Dare look like Monopoly Junior), is not the only element that escalates [sic]. For example, there are many conflicts and woes that each character has to face. Whether it is academic failure or abuse, these circumstances help to make this novel realistic. Kelly constructed an amazing plot considering the novel's length. It was filled with many WTFs and OMGs - which succinctly describes how this book had me on the edge.Kelly provides a gritty dramatis personae that comprises of five major characters. David is the quite the philosopher. He questions humanity, life and motivation often. He uses his Eureka players as subjects for his abstruse theories. Jacob, the narrator, idolizes David. He even begins to sound like David later in the novel. There is also Stephen. He is the smug nerd who feels like he needs to prove himself. Emily is that deranged-looking chic most try to avoid in isolated parking lots. Beneath her dark make-up, she is a wolverine, ready to do anything in honor of Eureka and David. Then there is Cameron - the beautiful girl who no one would expect to have a scarred past. These characters have a lot in common. They cannot attach significance to their lives, and their rejection in society, especially the microcosm of high school, is no aid at all. This is why they feel the urge to embrace Eureka. It is a panacea that helps them to forget their woes and to add meaning to their lives. Eureka is the extension of David, and this is another reason why they obsess over David too. With such a passion for Eureka, these characters neglect the salient aspects of living a conventionally fulfilling life, such as education. They have found their solace in David - a leader who they are destined to impress, a leader who accepts them despite their conditions that their very society frowns upon.This intriguing plot and these perplexing characters deserve to be encased in extraordinary style. I must say that Kelly's writing is beautiful. I think this alone needs to make that YA label disappear from this novel's description. I know that young adults are capable of appreciating fine writing (such as myself), but I still think that this novel fits a more seasoned audience as well. Snippets of eloquence can be found on every page. What captivated me the most about Kelly's style was his generous use of metaphors. I wish I could add some examples but I have no permission to do so, so take my word. Compelling figurative language is a literary element that is being dismissed by many authors, and this is another reason why I found [sic] so refreshing. I also was thankful for Kelly's smooth transitions across the time frames. The novel heavily relies on David's flashbacks and then jumps into the presence with ease.*I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for my honest review.**This review appeared first on Oh, Chrys!"}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4824108-victoria", "userReview": "This review is also published on Always a Booklover[sic] was something I didn\u2019t expect at all. Even the name was unexpected. I thought there was something wrong with my computer when I saw the name, to be honest. But it certainly did capture my attention. Nevertheless, I don\u2019t see the link with the book. Maybe I missed some clue, but yeah, this isn\u2019t really important, is it? On to the book! So\u2026 this was a book I wasn\u2019t prepared for. When I saw the blurb, I was instantly intrigued. I mean, what could changing your life mean? So I decided to read it. And I was blown away, truly I was. I was prepared for a book that was maybe slightly immature, maybe funny. What I was not prepared for was this. It truly got me sucked in by the level of thought that went into it.While I cannot say that this is a book that brought me through a wide array of emotions, I can say that it certainly got me thinking. Maybe sometimes, we do have to change our lives. And sometimes, we do need that push that this game gave the players. Sometimes, we have to stop living behind our fa\u00e7ade, pretending everything is okay. Maybe sometimes, we just have to step out and do something else and just do what we want.I did really enjoy reading the book. In all aspects, this book helped me to see a different aspect of life. Many times, the books I read aren\u2019t talking about the poorer side of society, where people really struggle to live. In this way, this book was an eye-opener, seeing how sometimes, people just want to be heard. To have an identity of one\u2019s own, to truly be who one is, instead of being what society defines them to be. The plot of [sic] was rather complex and I loved getting to understand the characters more and more as they matured and through them playing the game. It was, simply put, incredible. I truly saw how all the characters thought and how they really were like, especially towards the end. The beginning was a little slow, but it really picked up towards the end. I loved how the story was told, with little commentaries thrown in by the psychiatrist whenever we are brought back to the present. It really gave me insights as to how David thought, because so little was really known about him. At the same time, we also started knowing more about Jacob. Up till now, right at the end of the story, I\u2019m not certain whether he\u2019s really sane. I mean, he did seem a bit unstable towards the end. But I guess, you win some, you lose some yeah? The characters in this book were really good to read about. I felt like they really had substance to them. As in, the main characters were really focused on, and I felt I got to know all of them equally, except maybe for Jacob, but that\u2019s cause he is the main character. As I mentioned earlier, character development was great too! I love character development, so it really got me interested as I saw how the characters matured and started understanding more.All in all, this was a really good book. I did truly enjoy it, and was hooked, especially towards the end. While the beginning seemed a bit slow and monotonous at times, I found it all to be a great set-up for the ending and it just allowed everything to fall neatly into place. Certainly a very well planned-out book and one that truly made me think."}, {"userName": "Ariana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11022788-ariana", "userReview": "This is a novel that will keep reverberating long after you put down your Kindle. It's such a unique text, and Jacob's voice is really endearing, even in his most awkward moments (in one bittersweet excerpt, he attempts to comfort a girl whose mom is battling cancer, and with one sentence his good intentions go awry). First, the Six are incredibly well-developed and relatable characters- Jacob describes them as his family unit, an indispensable part of him. In Jacob, an embattled high school freshman, Scott Kelly has created an exceptionally bright adolescent narrator (I would compare him to Holden Caulfield, but that would misrepresent how unique Jacob is). He idolizes David, whose philosophy and antics are impressive- \"Sartre was right,\" David says, after one hilarious and thought-provoking vignette in which he proves that \"people get comfortable with who they are and let that definition control them.\" \"The Devil is a scapegoat, hell is manmade,\" is Jacob's response, \"It has sidewalks and street signs but no mirrors. You can see everyone but yourself.\" The Six believe that people definie themselves by how other people view them- but what happens if a pretty girl can't be pretty and the big jock can't be a strong leader? The subject matter gives readers a lot to chew on, dealing with everything from economic and social classism to dealing with terminally ill family members and Alzheimer's, and playing Eureka is a brilliant bit of escapism that will haunt you as you read this book. This is a great book that will make you examine your life in ways you never thought to before."}, {"userName": "Susan Laine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6582129-susan-laine", "userReview": "4.5. stars.This was a most curious book. Any book that starts off with a death (accident, suicide, or murder?) can go two ways: promising or bad. This one is the first. It's natural for people to play games, but for this group of young people playing a game, Eureka, is life-changing. Literally. When tagged, the target has a quarter of an hour time to change their lives dramatically. The escalation of this game is at the heart of the story that starts off a bit on the slow side, but the pace quickens toward the end, and there are surprises.The writing is good, with some one or two words sentences, but that works since the narrator is a kid, Jacob. What took out a star for me, however, was the fact that Jacob is no hero. He's an antihero, and he's selfish and unable to change the core of his being despite adversities. Blindly he follows David, the inventor of Eureka, anywhere, which makes him seem stupid. These people try to find meaning, but their methods are so extreme, and I think despite their claims to the contrary, it's about 70-30 in favor of thrill seeking instead. The six characters come through quite clearly as personalities, and unfortunately they're all broken from broken situations, so there's not much hope here.This is not my typical genre for reading, but it was thought-provoking and definitely stays with me for a long time to come, I think. For that reason I do recommend this."}, {"userName": "Psylk", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6949621-psylk", "userReview": "This isn't my usual type of book, however, I really enjoyed it. It makes you think and doesn't seem so horribly young adult that adults can't enjoy it. It covers some very interesting topics. I loved that all of the characters were so flawed and real. Most young adult books seem to have these perfect characters meant to only be the best influence. Sometimes we learn more from the bad influences though. The format and the way the story was told kept me interested from start to finish. There is also a great twist ending that I think everyone will appreciate.Give this book a shot I don't think you will be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12109186-sarah", "userReview": "I was immediately drawn to the story and characters from the very first chapter. From that point on, there are twists and turns that make a great book. It's refreshing to read a book that makes you think differently about life from the eyes of teens while not including magic, vampire lust or child gladiators. Although I loved reading all of those, of course, I think it made me forget that I could possibly feel a rush from a story that can actually happen.Not only is it original in that way, the writing is beautiful. Yes, is there a game being played, but at the same time, the author plays with the words. He includes many philosophical questions that would excite any college philosophy professor who likes to use current media to illustrate their lessons.I finished sic while sitting in a crowded area full of people and I looked around and had that whoa moment and then had to remember that nobody around me had experienced what I just finished.

Some start with a great idea and others have beautiful prose, but to have both interwoven in one book is a rare, lovely thing. The Age of Miracles is one - the idea that the planet's revolution is gradually slowing sings out with lush phrases.[sic] is another. The book is about a group of kids who play a game called Eureka, invented by David, the ringleader. (More about him later.) In the game, if someone gets tagged \"It,\" they must do something in the next fifteen minutes to completely change his life. Or her life. At first the game is simple - a damaged, gorgeous girl gets tagged and kisses a nerdy guy in front of everyone in the school. But as things progress, the game and the changes inflicted by the kids themselves become more and more trippy.That's the concept, and it's a good one. A lesser writer would have created a decent manuscript that tells the story of the kids and the game as a compelling enough read. But this is Scott Kelly, who is a real wordsmith. Look at how he describes Kent's father, the landlord of the trailer park where the Eureka players all live:Scott Kelly, the authorKent's dad slept under an awning. Rolls of fat spilled out from the sides of the larn chair. Dad once warned me to stay away from Mr. Gimble - failry easy advice to follow, because the landlord seemed violent and pissed off at all times.A sweaty thatch of faded blondhair gave way to fat cheeks and thick jowls. What struck me most was how sad Kent's dad looked. Not mad at all. Just a defeated frown, like he was about to start bawling in his sleep. Like dreaming was torment. Like it hurt to be.I could guess the cause of his nightmares: the landlord hated being alone with himself.The narrator is Jacob. He frames the story as he speaks to police, to a youth psychologist, and also to us. [sic] begins with David's death, and throughout the book, Jacob is trying to describe what happened. I dare you to read that first paragraph and not want to find out what happens:My personal savior is named David Bloom, and presently he's falling about ten stories from the top of a water tower. And my stupid stunned mind; all I can think is that he looks great doing it. Arms spread, fingertips extended, face serene - homicide by stage dive. His body returns to the earth below, the ten-story drop reducing him to a streak of white and blue cloth, brown hair blown back from closed eyes. Maybe he's smiling. Maybe I just like to think so.By the way - the story is told in the past tense, a big plus for me. I'm not a present tense fan at all. After that first paragraph, the tense switches smoothly to the past, and Kelly makes it work. And the added concept of David's fall (or flight) is extended throughout the book, as Jacob seeks the blame for David's death: \"I blame the death of David Bloom on the fact that after the math, David always won. His solar system spun, and we were trapped in its orbit.\"David himself is the catalyst, although his influence extends through the other kids. He is attractive: David's skin shone against low-hanging sun, wisps of curled brown hair a halo charged by the dawn's light. Never got a haircut his mom didn't give, so it was shoulder-length, in calm curls. Angry almond eyes.The other kids are vivid characters as well. There is Kent, the son of the landlord, who could have been a simple, static character but reveals layers of personality as the story unfolds. Cameron is the damaged beauty, molested by Kent's dad, who kisses Steven, the dweeby guy. There's Emily, the girl who is \"all dyed black hair and army boots.\" She might be one of my favorite characters, even though she is dangerous. Perhaps because she is dangerous - she refuses to put up with things as they are. Perhaps it is the reason that she embraces Eureka. The kids are the players : they are called the Six.And then there is an outsider, Nora - an overweight girl that Jacob falls for. The description of her and the growing relationship between Jacob and the girl who refuses to play the game that takes over the lives of the Six. That creates a great tension between her and Jacob, although the other relationships (between Cameron and Kent, Emily and Jacob, and Jacob and David himself) are also explored deeply. It's as if Kelly stretches things, so we can see the thoughts and feelings behind the mumbled conversations and making out sessions between the members of the Six and Nora.There were some sections that made me pause. For example, in the second half of the book, when David talks to the Six about his philosophy, he doesn't sound like a teen but a professor. I get that he is supremely intelligent (he paints impressions of music so you can almost hear it) but would a teen kid really say, \"Change is the only constant, and so we must constantly change\"?I was also disappointed that Nora became a thin girl. Over the course of the book, she loses weight and shows off her mile-longlegs and her \"athletic ponytail.\" I would have loved the originality if Jacob had continued to fall for her, pounds and all.However, I must say that these flaws (along with one POV change and one over-compression of events) stood out BECAUSE the book is so good. If that lesser writer had offered the book, these would have been lost, as trash inside a messy trailer gets kicked to one side. In the glowing symphony of Kelly's book, I noticed them because of the beauty of everything else.I would still highly recommend [sic] because of the concept, the writing, the characters - and the amazing ending. The book accomplished that rare thing - it entertained me and made me think, at the same time."}, {"userName": "Corina ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2919367-corina", "userReview": "sic It isn\u2019t often that I read something and it leaves me speechless, actually that\u2019s pretty rare. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that [sic] by Scott Kelly blew me away. I\u2019ll admit this isn\u2019t my typical genre of books, I tend to stay in the paranormal romance area, but I am incredibly glad I decided to venture out into new territory.It was the book blurb that initially drew me in and the story that unfolded in the following 208 pages was intense and original. I can honestly say I\u2019ve never read a story like this before and the sheer concept of it fascinated and captured me. I could not put this book down. Jacob is compelling as he retells the story of David Bloom, Eureka, and the six.While playing Eureka, six dysfunctional teens use the game to change their lives while psychoanalyzing every decision that people make and what makes a person who they are, circumstance or something else entirely. I like Jacob. I can\u2019t help it, there is just something about the character that makes me want to reach out and be his friend.He isn\u2019t a bad person and he has a moral compass unlike other people in \u201cthe six\u201d. I think the only character I wanted to slap on a regular basis was Emily and the fact that I disliked her so much shows me that Kelly has an incredible handle on all his characters. If I can feel so much about one character hate or love, it means that author, in my opinion, is an exceptional writer.There are so many characters I could relate to, Jacob, Nora, Kent even David occasionally. I loved the way Kelly explored the inner psyche of people and the things we learn along the way from Jacob while he\u2019s in the police station kept me riveted. Every time I thought I had the ending figured out there was a twist thrown in and when I finally did get to the end I was like, huh\u2026well I\u2019ll be damned.[sic] is one of those amazing books that has you on the edge of your seat the entire way through and then when the end finally comes you\u2019re so blown away that you sit there for a few minutes contemplating how the hell you just sat in the same place until 4:30 in the morning just to finish said book.This is a book I will most definitely be keeping and re-reading it was that good. I\u2019ve never really taken the time to think about how things are different for people who don\u2019t have their basic needs met and I suppose that\u2019s because mine have always been met so it\u2019s hard for me to picture anyone else\u2019s not getting met.But [sic] is a shining example of what happens when you think you have nothing to lose. I\u2019d recommend this book to anyone who loves stories that are different and somewhat out there. But as a paranormal romance junkie, I\u2019ll tell you I loved this book to death, so really I think it transcends genres. If you like to read, pick this up.\u201cTake my offer and change now, in fifteen minutes\u2014or wait for Emily. Throw off your burdens and put up a good chase, or let them shackle your legs so chaos can stalk you with a smile on her face. It makes no difference. Change is coming.

A game which has fantastic, chaotic and sometimes tragic results.The question of \"What am I holding on to?\" kept recurring to me as I read. \"Do I really need permission to let go? Must I wait to be tagged It?\"My husband is my personal \"David\". In the nine years since I met him, I have change homes. I have changed almost everything in my home, from nearly every stick of furniture (some more than once) to wall hangings, clothing, cars, appliances, flooring, outbuildings, houseplants, you name it. Mostly giving the 'old' things away (some still new in the box). I have reduced my personal 'stuff' again and again until only the essentials remain. I am challenged to continue to revise my definition of what 'essential' means. I have changed jobs; I walked away from 9 years in a great company, good benefits, decent pay, all to start a trucking company with my husband and take off over the road. We have talked about selling the house and living in the truck. We may yet do that.My experiences letting go took more than fifteen minutes of consideration, but they were still jarring, scary, and sometimes painful. But always, looking back, I feel nothing but freedom from that letting go. My husband challenges me to let go. He is my Eureka.Reading [sic].... I love that it draws attention to the freedom and practice of letting go. I love seeing the characters grow (or not) - strike that. Maybe change is the better word. The story embraces the idea of what might happen when young people stumble upon this practice on their own. David stumbled upon the truth of the constancy of change, of letting go, and shared his insight with his friends and they all had the courage to explore what it meant for them. Discovery of Self. What drives me? What holds me back? What sets me free? That is what [sic] explored for me. And before I let it go, I hug a little smug feeling of satisfaction to myself, that my own life has known the freedom of change and of letting go.May everyone who reads [sic] take a moment to look at their own life and hold it up to the light of Eureka and see if they need to be tagged, or if they can simply let go from time to time."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15794858-leslie", "userReview": "There are so many ways to describe this book -- gritty, gripping, edgy, tough, fascinating, unsettling...This is the second novel I've read by Scott Kelly, and I was up almost all night reading until it was finished.Kelly is a magician at describing despair, turmoil, and dysfunction in a way that bites to the core without being trite, stereotypical, or allowing the characters to be pathetically self-absorbed. He is a masterful writer, and one whose books I will seek out going forward.This book strikes on so many levels. The plot is interesting and full of action. There were many deliciously unsettling moments when my stomach gripped tight in anticipation and foreboding of what was coming next. As the characters lives and experiences unfold, the story takes on a poignancy that draws the reader in to such a degree that we can start to feel a part of the Six. I found myself both wanting to cheer for them as well as reach into the page and turn them in a different direction.At another level, the author explores basic human needs and the degree to which we will go to find love, approval, family, and a sense of belonging. Lastly, there is a psychological delving into behavior, rationale, and dysfunctional minds. This more rich exploration of the human psyche is all just part of the book and a natural extension of the events that take place in the story. The author doesn't preach to us, he doesn't tell us what we should think, and he doesn't moralize. It is exceptionally well-done.If you like a gritty read, a read that gets you thinking, a read that challenges stereotypes and creates questions in your mind, Scott Kelly's \"[sic]\" and \"The Blue\" belong at the top of the list."}, {"userName": "Brenda H", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2852709-brenda-h", "userReview": "This was a really interesting book.

Another draw is to see how these 5 seemingly normal kids are able to fall under the spell of the sixth and how this affects their lives and those around them.This is a quick read (approx 200 pages). The book is well-written with interesting plot twists and nicely developed characters.Rating: 4 stars"}, {"userName": "William Yin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12406257-william-yin", "userReview": "This book is amazing, and probably one of the best books I've ever read. Each character is so well-developed and easy to relate to, as each character has their own personality, background, and challenges that they have to face. The plot itself is really intriguing as well, how six teens play a game similar to Tag where, if they are tagged they need to change their lives in 15 minutes... But that only scratches the surface of what this book is about. The book goes through the pains and sufferings of each individual character, the experiments that are conducted, and just a plausible connection between the reader and the book itself. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age or background. This book is a must-read."}, {"userName": "Alexia Polasky", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11592152-alexia-polasky", "userReview": "Simply AMAZING!

This book has interesting characters that play my emotions with their mouth-opening traits and crazy decisions they take in their lives, which directly or indirectly have something to do with eureka. The story also unfold into a quite unexpected way.My main interest here is the characters. At first I was made to not like some certain character, but then I find their background and reasons for why they behave the way they do, and I understand. On the other hand, I might like a character at first, but as the story moved forward, I had a change of mind and turn to not like them. However, I found the main character, Jacob, to be a bit annoying. He seems to make things more difficult than they really are, for example, the way he acts after quitting Eureka, and he sometimes has some views which seem complicated but in fact quite simple when seen from another point of view. Sometimes he also looks not sure about his opinions\u2014one day he thinks it is this, the next he thinks it is that. But I can see why the author made him so, because story wouldn\u2019t go the way it does if Jacob were more practical and simple.This books offers some views deserving deeper thinking. The talk about identity and people\u2019s branding is worth reflecting. Nevertheless, in some points I think the opinions stated are too generalized that they become judgmental. Not all people are like what the Six seems to try to convince the readers. But the debates with Mr. Aschen help balance the opinions.That said, I think this is a good book. It\u2019s entertaining, gripping with its cynical tone and interesting characters. And adding to those, it has something more to offer to its readers\u2019 mind."}, {"userName": "Sana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9381082-sana", "userReview": "Actual rating: 2.5 well there has been great things and bad things. The great things are the impeccable writing and the dialogue. Possibly the best dialogue i ever read. tge character are well eritten too . however they do some thing OOC that it seems like the writer is doing it just for the sake of drama. and having strong characters like Emily and jacob follow an obvious narcitst like David seems out of character to me. i didn't think what Jacob did in the ending made sense. seemed a bit too evil for his character to do, even after all that happened he still seemed like he is tge type of guy who would never ruin somone's life. It was a nice read. i enjoyed most of the book because of the dialogue i can NOT express how AWESOME the dialogue is. truly. and the characters too. i guess i expected too much of this book and was diappointed by the ending and some OOC moments and that's why i am not giving it a higher rating. i stand by it tho"}, {"userName": "Robin Clayton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5964965-robin-clayton", "userReview": "After reading \"The Blue\" by this author I was eager to read another of his books. This was a fantastic read. The plot follows a group of six (6) high school friends and a game of Eureka invented by the leader of the pack. They use the game to try to change the trajectory of their lives; to escape the abusive families and poverty of their trailer park. Eventually lives are irrevocably changed as the game walks a dangerous line between a cult and vehicle for meaningful change.I loved the writing style and the plot was so intriguing I had a hard time putting the book down! This guy could be one of my new favorite authors. He's good.

An unconventional plot, smooth narration, clever twists are some plus points. Many of the characters were well-written and described. At times this book can disappoint the reader but it goes promising most of the time. The climax is kind of predictable and disappointing too."}], "description": "Six teens are devoted to a game with one rule: If a player gets tagged, they must change their life within the next fifteen minutes. The better the player, the bigger the change. One might give their car away, or punch the school bully. Another might change identities or sacrifice their virginity. Anything to keep evolving, to avoid fitting into a label or caring about the junk they own. But their quest for enlightenment has taken a rotten final turn - one of the players has murdered the game's creator, the teen prophet (cult leader?) David Bloom. Our narrator is being framed for the crime; can he clear his name and discover which of his lifelong friends is the murderer before he takes the fall?[sic] is a gritty teen murder mystery that delves into the psychology of enlightenment among the criminally dysfunctional. It is a winner of WEBook's Page2Fame award and a cult classic among its thousands of teen fans on Wattpad, some of whom have actually applied Kelly's fictional game to their own lives.", "title": "[sic]", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15847364-sic", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1345866204l/15847364.jpg", "reviews": 62, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6479132.Scott_Kelly", "name": "Scott  Kelly"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Thriller", "Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15847364-sic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25342489-keep-the-ghost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17160502-the-blue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31867466-shadow-box", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11790648-frightened-boy"]}
