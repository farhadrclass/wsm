It amazed me. It flipped me around and turned me upside down. I was overtaken, absorbed, and transfixed in a whirlwind of emotion.The End of the Affair was exactly what I needed to help me through some recent difficulties in my personal life. (No, I didn't have an affair with a married woman, heh. But a relationship did recently end for me, and that kind of thing is painful, and tough to deal with, as you probably know.) This novel helped me through all that: By channeling the thoughts, emotions, and lessons from the book, I was able to understand myself and my situation better. I read it at just the right time and the impact was healthy, significant, and powerful.It seems that most good books show, in some way, how ridiculous we all are. And what is more ridiculous than love? The End of the Affair shows the nuances, complexities, depths and strengths of love; how serious, dynamic, and mighty it is, while also showing how selfish it is. And you can't really have love without hate, can you? Love and hate of another; love and hate of self; love and hate of God -- or of his nonexistence -- are the major themes. The love depicted in the novel is not a halfway love (is there such a thing as a halfway love?). It is in extremes: it either loves or hates. Love in all it's splendor and horror, Greene gets it. The novel is also about life, and death, and fate, and God, and all the struggles associated with these things. The existential struggle of the individual; the selfish power of our personalized emotions in our ultimate search for love in its many forms. \"But if I start believing that, then I have to believe in your God. I'd have to love your God. I'd rather love the men you slept with.\"The highs that are the state of being emphatically in love are conveyed beautifully in this novel. \"...the moment of absolute trust and absolute pleasure, the moment when it was impossible to quarrel because it was impossible to think.\" The way your very insides change -- not just when you're with that person, but how everything in life has a more ecstatic, elated feel to it, because the person you love is always in the back of your mind. And, because of that, and because love makes you happy -- releasing all kinds of awesome chemicals -- you associate your beloved with almost everything, and almost everything seems and feels better. Life is so much better when you're in love, and as you turn the pages of this novel, you feel it.The way you put your best self forward every time; the positive inner desire and motivating factor of trying to prove that you're completely worthy, and the very best for that person. The electricity that starts upon contact; how it never really goes away, but constantly gets reaffirmed through smiles, and small gestures, and actually grows stronger the longer you're together.\"It's a strange thing to discover and to believe that you are loved when you know that there is nothing in you for anybody but a parent or a God to love.\"The fucked up selfishness of it all. The fact that while our emotions and inner selves are on high alert and more intense, so is our awareness of our shortcomings and weaknesses. We become extremely self-centered. ME. The insecurity, the jealousy; the panicky anxiety -- how all those subconscious, hidden pathologies start to surface -- you push them back, but you're made aware that they are there.The lack of control.\"Insecurity is the worst sense that lovers feel; sometimes the most humdrum desireless marriage seems better. Insecurity twists meanings and poisons trust.\"Yet even with your insecurities and imperfections, because you're seen as perfect in your lovers eyes, you start to see yourself as perfect. Deep down you know it's a farce (which is probably why jealousy and pettiness often begin to play roles), but it feels great, and it makes you love your partner all the more... but still, in the back of your mind.....\"If I'm a bitch and a fake, is there nobody who will love a bitch and a fake?\"The desperate longing, the fear of finding that it isn't real; that the other doesn't feel the same way.\"I had to touch you with my hands, I had to taste you with my tongue; one can't love and do nothing.\" The fear of it ending.\"Sometimes I get tired of trying to convince him that I love him and shall love him forever. He pounces on my words like a barrister and twists them. I know he is afraid of that desert which would be around him if our love were to end, but he can\u2019t realize that I feel exactly the same. What he says aloud, I say to myself silently and write it here.\"The way you love that person with your full throbbing heart; then hate that person with every angry, hateful fiber in your very being. But oh the joy. Oh, the complexity.. Oh, the might. Love and Hate.Then it ends. Your world is shaken to the core. You see something that reminds you of the person and the times you had, and feel like someone punched you in the stomach. And you see that person in everything, so the pain is always there. The sharp, unbearable pain, like your whole life has been torn upside down; the sick feeling; the empty feeling. You used to love yourself. You now hate everything. Life was splendid, amazing, magical. Life is now dark grey. Painful. The grasping for what was, for understanding what happened. What did I do wrong? The brooding. The self obsession. Did she ever really love me in the first place? What could I have done differently? If only I hadn't said this, or given that impression. Why didn't I see it coming? Paradigm shift all you can, it doesn't go away; the love wants to exist. But it can't.The gloomy nothing; the hugging of air; the unfulfilled images and dreams. Just because life has become painful for you, you want it to be painful for everyone else; or you at least you want them to have sympathy for you. How dare they be so happy. Look at me. Pay attention to my pain. How dare others smile and enjoy life. Do you know my pain? ME. My heart, my pain \u2013- nothing else matters \u2013- listen to me, ME, ME. Love, whether in its existence or broken, is like that: it consumes and is selfish. \"I hate you, God. I hate you as though you actually exist.\"All in all, broken hearts heal with time, especially if a new love is found. But I think there is a part of the heart that breaks and never comes back; that never fully heals and thus makes us at least a little transformed from who we were before our heart was broken. And slowly through time you realize that not only did you lose a part of yourself, but a part of you gets generated that wasn't there before. The whole thing doesn't make sense -- love never does. But you realize that you are a different and stronger person for having gone through it. It doesn't mean it was worth it. But having found new parts of yourself -- or having generated new parts of yourself -- you've gained something inside that can't ever be taken away; something that will be with you, and only you, for the rest of your life.This novel amazed me. Graham Greene pulls all this off brilliantly, with emotions toyed and pulled at; with life affirming sentences and quotes on just about every page. He gave me some of the most beautiful and articulate writing I've ever witnessed. It\u2019s hard to imagine how another book could affect my emotions, could hit me in the heart, the way this did. To feel that I'm not the only one; to have it conveyed to me so perfectly -- through me -- was amazing.When I finished this I had a tingle running up and down my spine. Light fireworks were in my stomach. My head was a happy buzz. My shoulders were so light they had no weight. My mostly numb, yet slightly tickly legs, tripped me up as I hopped from my reading chair to get to my bed, where I just laid there, thinking for an hour, while feeling amazing and transcendent."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Masterson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28953843-jennifer-masterson", "userReview": "5 Stars!!! I just spent 3 days being read to by Colin Firth and it was fantastic!!! This is the best narrated audiobook I have ever listened to!!! Now let me say a little about the book itself. I loved it! From the first sentence I was entranced in this complicated love affair. The writing is exquisite! It grabbed my soul and set me on fire! \"This is a record of hate far more than of love.\" - Maurice Bendrix\"The End of the Affair\" is about a writer named Maurice Bendrix. Maurice is a very jealous man. This is quite ironic because he is jealous of Sarah, the married woman he has had an affair with. Sarah ended this affair with Maurice suddenly one day in 1944. Maurice is obsessed with Sarah. He is so obsessed and jealous that he even hires a detective to spy on her. That is all I'm going to say about the book. If I go any further I will get into spoiler territory.I need to read more classic literature because this book just took my breath away!Highly recommended to fans of classic literature and/or fans of Colin Firth. To get the full experience listen to the audio version with Mr. Firth's narration!!!- Just a side note that was brought to my attention. The book does deal with God and Christianity, specifically Catholicism."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[ for all the trouble of their relations, the pain of surrendering maurice proves very nearly unendurable: it is as though sarah has punched a hole through her heart, a hole that is both defined by and then filled by god. without the pain she would not need to believe at all, but faith is in greene a form of suffering and sarah has caught it, a disease that somehow gives her the strength she needs not to break her vow.

In misery we seem aware of our own existence, even though it may be in the form of a monstrous egotism: this pain of mine is individual, this nerve that winces belongs to me and to no other. But happiness annihilates us: we lose our identity. The words of human love have been used by the saints to describe their vision of God, and so, I suppose, we might use the terms of prayer, meditation, contemplation to explain the intensity of the love we feel for a woman. We too surrender memory, intellect, intelligence, and we too experience the deprivation, the noche oscura, and sometimes as a reward a kind of peace. The act of love itself has been described as the little death, and lovers sometimes experience too the little peace. \u201dI am terribly late with this review but it wasn\u2019t my fault. One of my colleagues borrowed my book before I got the chance to transcribe the quotes I chose and I had to wait until he brought it back. The End of the Affair is part of Greene\u2019s Catholic series. I bought it before I found out about this tiny but significant detail and I started this with dread. I was expecting some kind of religious preach but it wasn\u2019t the case, fortunately. The author struggled all his life with the dilemma of God\u2019s existence and he projected his doubts on the narrators of some of his novels. As such, the novel, among other things, becomes a meditation on the probability of God\u2019s existence.The first part of the novel is more profane and describes, as you can guess, the end of an affair between a famous writer, Maurice Bendrix and the wife of a civil servant, Sarah. In the 2nd part we find out more about the reasons behind the sudden ending and the story becomes more of a discussion about God. \"Man made God in his own image, so it\u2019s natural he should love him. You know those distorting mirrors at fairs. Man\u2019s made a beautifying mirror too in which he sees himself lovely and powerful and just and wise. It\u2019s his idea of himself. He recognizes himself easier than in the distorting mirror which only makes him laugh, but how he loves himself in the other.\" The story is not linear, it jumps back and forth in time. We learn how the love story begun, how it was consumed by passion and jealously and how it abruptly ended with a betrayal from Sarah. We get to also find out her point of view, beautifully introduced by her journal.I would have been annoyed and taken aback by the religious talk weren\u2019t for Greene\u2019s amazing talent for words. Just as in The Quiet American, the author\u2019s prose is superb, I could probably quote here half of the novel and I would still miss some beautiful lines. \u201cI have never understood why people who can swallow the enormous improbability of a personal God boogle at a personal Devil. I have known so intimately the way that demon works in my imagination. No statement that Sarah ever made was proof against his cunning doubts, though he would usually wait till she gone to utter them . He would prompt our quarrels long before they occurred: he was not Sarah\u2019s enemy so much as the enemy of love, and isn\u2019t that what the devil is supposed to be. I can imagine that if there existed a God who loved, the devil would be driven to destroy even the weakest, the most faulty imitation of that love. Wouldn\u2019t he be afraid that the habit of love might grow, and wouldn\u2019t he try to trap us all into being traitors, into helping him extinguish love? If there is a God who uses us and makes his saints out of such material as we are, the devil too may have his ambitions; he may dream of training even such a person as myself, into being his saints, ready with borrowed fanaticism to destroy love wherever we find it. \u201cThe novel was intriguing and beautifully written, as I said, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it as the first contact with Graham Greene\u2019s work due to its subject. The Quiet American is a much better choice, in my humble opinion."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Of the less than ten novels in the universe which can conceivably be called PERFECT* (that is, without a single flaw, with so much mastery over the daunting literary terrain that it leaves the reader panting, gives him goosebumps, makes him believe in the sphere of art all over again)\u2014two of them undoubtedly are written by Graham Greene.

The yarn told is truly a cause for heartache: the themes of adultery and death, and above all, religion, are uber-heavy but with great craft Greene manages to make them accessible to his flabbergasted readership (of which, as I\u2019ve said, there must be more!).

To say it deserves it would be rather an understatement. Reading the book was actually one of those physically memorable experiences: curling up in a ball with it, crouched over it reading behind piles of work I should have been doing, completely zoning out the world around me until it was forced to my attention, not to mention the actual physical pain I felt at the beauty of some of the language employed. Greene's writing here is just absolutely astounding. I cannot emphasize that enough. It is an obsessive love he writes of, obstensibly. That's what the back cover and the short summaries would have us believe that this book is about. But that is not all this book is about. Not even close.Greene writes about hatred, the nature of belief, the nature of God and what it means to believe in Him, the physical and emotional experience of love, the effects that that love can have on our lives.... and blends it all together so that we see that none of those things can be seperated. This is one of three novels in his \"Catholic\" trilogy, and the love of and need for God is as intrinsic as the love and need for our soulmates in life. Everything in the end is about God, but through love and hate and the deepest emotions that can be written out from our core. Greene manages to convey emotions and ways of thinking about life and love that we have all felt, but in such a beautifully done way perhaps we could never quite express what it meant ourselves. There were phrases in the book that brought back vivid, intense flashes out of my own experiences, little poignant moments that exactly fit just some random little sentence inserted into a two page rant. That happened over and over again. If I did such things to my books, I would have paragraphs highlighted on every page. Many times during the book a sort of stream of consciousness is evident in the narration where it is unclear whether the narrator is expressing his thoughts or those of his lover's, whether his thoughts are now or in the past, or whether he can really tell himself which it is. I found that device to be very powerful, showing the effect that even the memory of great events can have upon us, and how visceral the feelings can be even all these years later. Greene is also not afraid to lay his characters bare, perhaps get them on our bad side, to show them in all their ugliness and pettiness- which makes them all the more real. It is how we all act in love and in times of desperation and need. This was so much better done than Heart of the Matter, where I think Greene really tries to keep the reader at more of a distance. That was a mistake. /This/ is a book that gets one thinking about God and love and what it's all about. One has to get at the reader's core before such basic beliefs can really be brought out to be questioned and beaten. And the author won't do that without first going there himself through his characters and his deeply felt, naked writing.Anyway... possibly the best treatise on love and God I've ever read, and certainly the one that will stay with me the longest. Those were just some random thoughts that came to me upon finishing it, but I hope it is enough that someone else will read it. It's an experience that everyone should have."}, {"userName": "Lizzy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30575403-lizzy", "userReview": "Spoil alert!Can a reader feel like having a split personality? I doubted myself while reading Graham Greene's The End of the Affair. I loved it and hated it; I thought it certainly deserved 5 stars for a few pages, but later found myself suffering so much and started loathing it. So, it could not deserve more than 2, right? It\u2019s not fair to suffer for nothing, I had to make someone pay for it! I loved Sarah and Bendrix and despised them at the same time. Don\u2019t try to understand me, I don\u2019t understand myself! Such beautiful passages about love, but suddenly it seemed about hate and jealousy, and I found myself betrayed! How can someone that loves so deeply, as Greene makes us believe Sarah loved Bendrix, later give him up for a God most of the time she doesn\u2019t believe in herself. Oh, I could commiserate with Bendrix for being abandoned without any explanation. I could not understand Sarah, for I am not even sure if I am a believer. But my beliefs are beyond the point. So, please, discount my failings in this respect. Bendrix\u2019s position I could identify with, and did. I knew that my love would easily turn to hate after such a betrayal while so much in love. Thus, the jealousy I could understand. Would I go to such length to prove myself right? I don\u2019t know, but I was never in his position and being honest with myself I have to say that, hypothetically, I might. Greene writes so majestically, that I could live with it all as he speaks of Bendrix or his own pain (it is almost a confessional, afterall):\n\"The sense of unhappiness is so much easier to convey than that of happiness. In misery we seem aware of our own existence, even though it may be in the form of a monstrous egotism: this pain of mine is individual, this nerve that winces belongs to me and to no other. But happiness annihilates us: we lose our identity.\"\nEnough about how I loved and hated Sarah and Bendrix\u2019s love tragedy. Summing it up, this is a beautifully written, sad, angry, heartbreaking novel. It is about a passionate and illicit love affair that metamorphoses through into a religious epiphany. It's the story of Maurice Bendrix, a British writer, who falls in love with Sarah, a woman married to Henry, a civil servant. They fall in love in London in 1939, during the Blitz. Their passion burn, unstoppable and with no reservations, until she leaves him unexpectedly and all that remains are bitter ashes. Betrayal, an understandable reaction is how he reacts and his ensuing preposterous crises of jealousy.The story is not linear, it begins after the break-up, and is told by Bendrix in flashbacks. It goes back and forth, and in that is expertly done by Greene. Ultimately, Bendrix looks at the breakup from the point of view of Sarah, through her journal, and goes forward again as Bendrix tries to make amends for his past jealousy, and ends in a transcendental meditation on divinity. He dreams of a reconciliation, but that was not to be. Thus Bendrix finelly gets over his anger at Sarah, just to find out she's dying, and turns his anger at God. So Greene/Bendrix tells at the beginning what The End of the Affair is all about:\n\"When I began to write I said this was a story of hatred, but I am not convinced. Perhaps my hatred is really as deficient as my love. I looked up just now from writing and caught sight of my own face in a mirror close to my desk, and I thought, does hatred really look like that?\"\n But I am here to tell you how I am divided about it. When I started reading it, after having seen the movie, I had expectations. Expectations are hell: they make you biased within yourself. But forget about them for the time being. See how I was and still am conflicted about their story?So, back to the beginning! The opening is superb and the ambience for the story is set. Bendrix meets Henry walking in the rain, they go for a drink and end up in Sarah and Henry\u2019s house, Sarah is also out in that wet night, but soon returns and Bendrix tells us:\n\"\u2018It\u2019s nice to see you,\u2019 I said. \u2018Been out for a walk?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s a filthy night,\u2019 I said accusingly, and Henry added with apparent anxiety, \u2018You\u2019re wet through, Sarah. One day you\u2019ll catch your death of cold.\u2019A clich\u00e9 with its popular wisdom can sometimes fall through a conversation like a note of doom, yet even if we had known he spoke the truth, I wonder if either of us would have felt any genuine anxiety...\"\nConcomitantly we compare love and hate (are they not one and the same?). Sarah herself is conflicted:\n\"I said to God, \u2018So that\u2019s it. I begin to believe in you, and if I believe in you I shall hate you. I have free will to break my promise, haven\u2019t I, but I haven\u2019t the power to gain anything from breaking it... You let me sin, but you take away the fruits of my sin. You make me drive love out, and then you say there\u2019s no lust for you either. What do you expect me to do now, God? Where do I go from here?\u2019\"\nSo, suddenly The End of the Affair becomes a discussion of God. And Sarah pleads:\n\"Dear God, I\u2019ve tried to love and I\u2019ve made such a hash of it. If I could love you, I\u2019d know how to love them. ... I believe you are God. Teach me to love. I don\u2019t mind my pain. It\u2019s their pain I can\u2019t stand. Let my pain go on and on, but stop theirs. Dear God, if only you could come down from your Cross for a while and let me get up there instead. If I could suffer like you, I could heal like you.\"\nAnd like Bendrix, towards the end I wanted to yell: not this way! But Greene conquered me, besides others with:\n\"What a fool I had been during three years to imagine that in any way I had possessed her. We are possessed by nobody, not even by ourselves.\"\nI could not agree with him more. But at the end of what Bendrix has dubbed his \"record of hate\", he prays: \n\"O God, You've done enough, You've robbed me of enough, I'm too tired and old to learn to love, leave me alone for ever.\"\n I kept thinking that I hated and suffered with Bendrix and Sarah, for it's filled with such rolling emotions. If I am quoting Greene so much, it's only because I can't tell you better than through his own words. So, Sarah's explanation to Bencrix for how she can love him but not be with him, is superb:\"People go on loving God, don't they, all their lives without seeing him?\"And another passage:\"'Can you explain away love too?' I asked. 'Oh yes,' he said. 'The desire to possess in some, like avarice: in others, the desire to surrender, to lose the sense of responsibility, the wish to be admired. Sometimes just the wish to be able to talk, to unburden yourself to someone who won't be bored. The desire to find again a father or a mother. And of course under it all the biological motive.\" A novel written with such passion, such majesty, and that carries the reader through moments of wonder and moments of profound sadness, cannot be anything less than a masterpiece. A novel that examines love, obsession, hate and that among it all examines how its protagonists dwindle and suffer in their belief of God, is au concur. Nevertheless, despite its beauty for all my suffering I am rating The End of the Affair 4 stars. That is the only revenge I can get for the torture I went through while reading it. Worst, later I suffered even more while I comtemplated how to go about to write my review. It probably deserves 5 stars, I am not perfect after all! But a reserve the right to change my mind, and perhaps in the future, after a gratifying revisit, I may end granting the ultimate last star. Something to look for!"}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason", "userReview": "[her death (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Note : every possible plot spoiler included here... but I don't care. Let's go.So let me get this right. This miserable sourpuss atheistic type author guy Maurice meets this hot slutty (their word) woman Sarah who is married to England\u2019s most boring civil servant Henry. They have a full on steamy affair right under Henry\u2019s nose for four years and are very happy, except Maurice gives the impression that even when he\u2019s happy he\u2019s miserable. Like Morrissey. Similar name. Anyway, it\u2019s World War 2 and there\u2019s a big air raid and the guy goes downstairs to check on the cat or something and WHAM a great big German missile hits the building and a door falls on him. Sarah runs downstairs and sees his arm sticking out and thinks he\u2019s dead. She runs back upstairs and prays to God. So far so reasonable. But actually she doesn\u2019t believe in God. Well, people do strange stuff when they think their true love is dead under a door. She says if God makes Maurice not be dead then she will a) believe in God and b) give up Maurice. So when he wanders into her room all covered with dust and saying wow I just got hit by a door, I thought I was a goner but I just got a headache, how about that, she immediately thinks that God did it. She instantly takes it for a Miracle and not just a near-miss. And that\u2019s the last she sees of him, she cuts him off without a word of explanation, thus plunging them both into suicidal despair. (What she says is \u201cLove doesn\u2019t end just because we don\u2019t see each other.\u201d Well, maybe, but shagging surely does.) (Sample quote from Maurice after Sarah dumps him : I thought : hating Sarah is only loving Sarah and hating myself is only loving myself.Yes, it\u2019s psychobabble 20 years before the term was invented. )I suppose Sarah thinks that if she breaks the promise to God not to see him, then God will smite him completely dead with another door or handy piece of furniture. But this is not explained. But hey, this was a promise made under duress. And anyway, if she just takes a moment to think, she will surely realise that during any air raid on London in the War, and any air raid anywhere at any time, many people will have prayed to the God they actually believed in that their loved ones would not die and many people will then have found their loved ones had died in horror and agony nevertheless. And some like her would find their loved ones had survived. So where\u2019s the logic in that? Well, there isn\u2019t any. It\u2019s just human nature. Unless we can conjecture that God sits there saying oh, that\u2019s a good prayer, very well expressed, very sincere, I\u2019ll answer that one. But those prayers are rubbish, clich\u00e9 ridden, boring, really very bad, so those loved ones will have to fry. So I figured that this dame was not at the front of the queue when they were handing out brains. Actually, all these reasonable points are made by a Rational Atheist character who she goes to see to try to get him to argue her out of this insane piece of magical thinking. Oh the vow, the vow to the non-existent God! But it doesn\u2019t work : \u201chis fanaticism fixed the superstition deeper\u201d. By the way, the Rational Atheist has a big Facial Disfigurement, which has Blighted his Life. I think this is some kind of symbol.Then we get Sarah\u2019s diary and the full horror of her mind is laid bare. She loves Maurice, no, actually, she hates him. No, she loves him. But she hates God. No, she doesn\u2019t believe in him. Oh wait, she loves God, who she doesn\u2019t believe in. And she thinks she\u2019s a Catholic (no other varieties are available in Graham Greene\u2019s universe \u2013 Methodism or Zoroastrianism don\u2019t get a look in). She thinks she might be a Catholic but she doesn\u2019t believe! Hold the phone, yes she does. God! No God! Oh the pain! The pain! Love, hate, hate, love, belief, maybe \u2013 wah wah wah. Wah Wah.It becomes really tiresome. Sample diary quote:How good You (=God) are. You might have killed us with happiness, but You let us be with You in pain\u2026. Dear God, you know I want to want Your pain\u2026So eventually this majorly troubled woman ends up saying \u201cI\u2019ve caught belief like a disease\u201d and then dies. I see that many people think The End of the Affair is a very beautiful meditation on love and faith but it seemed to me as if it was presenting religious faith as if it\u2019s something lying in wait to trap the mentally exhausted person at their lowest point. Really quite nasty. If that was the end of The End of the Affair I could have been okay with this novel, and tried to overlook the tedious love-hate-pain-God loop tape playing throughout, but uh-oh, Greene gives his tortured tale a totally tendentious twist right at the end, where the Rational Atheist is CURED of his facial disfigurement because he snipped off a lock of the hair of the dead Sarah and slept on it. Now really, Mr Greene, pull the other one. It\u2019s got bells on.Conclusion: a mixed-up mess that doesn\u2019t work on any level which inexplicably gets included in 100 Best Novels lists, proving, once again, yes, I\u2019m on the wrong planet."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie", "userReview": "Update 11/11/2017: On this, my third experience of Graham Greene's masterpiece, I chose the audiobook, narrated by Colin Firth. . . and I just want to say to all fellow citizens of our beautiful Planet Earth:I'm sorry.I'm truly, truly sorry.I'm sorry I was flippant with fossil fuels.I'm sorry that I was erroneous with my emissions.I'm sorry that I drove my car longer and slower than necessary.I'm sorry that I took the long way home.It turns out, in listening to this audiobook of The End of the Affair, I found myself unable resist the indomitable combination of Mr. Darcy's (oops, I mean Mr. Firth's) voice and Mr. Greene's words.To be frank, I swerved.I swore.

And then I wanted to throw it across the room.I knew the basic plot of The End of the Affair because I had seen the movie version with Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore, but this was my first serious consideration of the text. It is a novel about the jealousy and anger one man feels after a love affair has ended. \u201cI measured love by the extent of my jealousy.\u201d Maurice Bendrix is a writer who is obsessed with Sarah Miles. Sarah abruptly ended her affair with Maurice one day in 1944, after a bomb blast nearly killed him in his London house. Suddenly she refused to see him and didn't speak to him for more than a year.After bumping into Sarah's husband, Henry, Maurice contacts a private detective to follow her. The investigator steals Sarah's journal, which Maurice reads and discovers why she broke off the relationship. (There are spoilers ahead, but I can't discuss my complaints about the book without mentioning this plot point. Since this novel is more than 60 years old and has been made into two movies, I think I can proceed.)The journal reveals that Sarah had been at Maurice's house when the bomb hit, and he had been knocked unconscious. Sarah couldn't rouse him and thought he was dead. She wasn't religious but she began to pray, and she told God she wouldn't see Maurice any more if he would be allowed to live. When Maurice recovered, Sarah decided to keep her promise to God and ended the affair. Sarah struggles with this sudden belief in God, and wishes she could return to Maurice. She even meets with a Catholic priest to talk about converting.\u201cI've caught belief like a disease. I've fallen into belief like I fell in love.\u201d When Maurice reads her journal and learns she still loves him, he contacts her and begs her to leave her husband. Sarah refuses. She soon dies from pneumonia, and both Maurice and Henry mourn her.At this point, I had only a few complaints about the novel. Much of the writing is powerful, especially when Greene wrote about Maurice's anger. The story is told from Maurice's point of view, with the exception of a few pages from Sarah's journal, but she never felt real to me. Maurice talks about his love and lust for her, and we read some of her own words, but Sarah was not a fully realized character. She was slight, ephemeral, and would slip through your fingers.For example, there were a few details of Sarah's kindness and generosity, but in her journal, she wrote: \"I'm a bitch and a fake and I hate myself.\" Her journal didn't match the person Maurice described, and I don't think Greene wrote women well.Additionally, the so-called love that Sarah and Maurice had did not seem real. Greene, who reportedly based Sarah on his real-life mistress, was good at writing about jealousy and rage, but not love. We see Maurice's obsession with her, but it's all telling and no showing.The story takes a weird turn after Sarah's death. There are several \"miracles\" that happen to different characters, and it's implied that Sarah has magically influenced events from beyond the grave. This is when I got disgusted with the book. I didn't believe any of the miracles, and I didn't believe that Maurice would believe in God because of those acts. \u201cI wrote at the start that this was a record of hate, and walking there beside Henry towards the evening glass of beer, I found the one prayer that seemed to serve the winter mood: O God, You've done enough, You've robbed me of enough, I'm too tired and old to learn to love, leave me alone forever.\" It seemed like Greene didn't know how to end the novel, so he threw in some miraculous works of God. I call bullshit.I understand that in real life, Greene was a Catholic. By coincidence, I read this novel shortly after finishing Brideshead Revisited, which also has religious and Catholic themes. I know England has a dark history with Catholicism, but come on, guys. I need a break from all this evangelism. I listened to this on audio, read by Colin Firth, and if I were to rate just Firth's performance, it would be 5 stars. He was phenomenal. However, I have enough complaints about the text and by the end was so irritated with the story arc that I'm giving this book a 3."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "\"A Thinly Disguised Autobiography\" (Fictitious Letters Never Sent or Written)Letter 1 (dated April 30, 1950 from CW to GG):Oh, my most desirable Godfather,I\u2019m sorry to learn you\u2019re suffering from writer\u2019s block. I don't recall you mentioning this affliction before. I\u2019m not the best one to give advice on such matters, but they say you should write about things with which you are familiar, not that there is much for you that doesn\u2019t fit within this category. Perhaps, my love, you could write something about us? A thinly disguised autobiography? Do you think anyone outside our circles would ever guess?I have another idea. I\u2019ve written down a list of key words for you. Perhaps you might find inspiration in them? For instance, you could build your novel around three, maybe even five, of them. They are, after all, some of our favourite things. See what you think of these (sorry for the length.

No matter what misfortune might befall either or both of us, my love never seems to wane.Your counsel to write an autobiography, albeit thinly disguised, is indeed the correct solution to my block. Of course, I can\u2019t write the truth about us (lest I embrace pornography and write the first truly Great Sex Novel of our times, which I might just do for you!), but I can find inspiration in it. I've decided to set this work during the war, you\u2019re married to a high-ranking public servant, not a millionaire. I\u2019m single and dote on you. Both of us are childless and able to indulge in our every sexual whim. We\u2019ll lie stretched across every bed we can get our bodies on, we'll fornicate in front of every fireplace, upon every rug and behind every altar we can discover on our travels. Nothing could possibly come between us, no commitment, no human, no being, except perhaps God. Even then, I haven\u2019t quite determined how or why even He could frustrate our love, which in the manner of the greatest Love should be nothing if not eternal.I love your list. Every word turns me on like an erogenous abstraction. In fact, each one appeals so much I can\u2019t bring myself to abandon it. So, if you will forgive me, I will use them all. All I have to do is pad them out with suitable verbs. And there aren't many verbs to describe what I have in mind!The proof is in the pudding, because since I embarked on this suggestion of yours, words have flown like that first plane trip of ours, during which a lock of your hair brushed my cheek and inflamed me below. Even now, as I await your arrival on Friday, I feel the same way. In my mind, I see you. I see myself touch you here...and here...and there...Your husband,Graham.The Vocabulary of LoveGraham Greene did eventually write his novel, using just such words. At first, I wondered whether it was a flaw in his otherwise great literary prowess that he used so many abstract words to describe his subject matter, then I came to the conclusion that it reflected a deliberate economy of both style and vocabulary. In such a short fiction, he didn\u2019t need many words. He didn't need more words. He didn\u2019t need different words. In the hands of a master, they were all the words that mattered, they were all the words he required to get to the heart of the matter.We are left to judge whether the people and the situations he created with them are adequate to the task of great literature.I've read the novel three times over the course of my life. While this time I was tempted to downgrade it to four stars because of stylistic issues, I decided to retain the five star rating I assigned it from my memory of the first two readings. There are not many novels that I deign to read thrice!Adulterous and Adulterated LoveWe know from the title and the beginning of the novel that there has been an affair and that it has come to an end.Greene plays around with time and subject matter to add drama and tension to a sequence of events that contains no surprise, apart from that which preoccupies the beginning and end of most affairs: the answer to the question \"why?\"Sarah Miles is married to a senior public servant in wartime England. The first person narrator (the first use of this perspective by Greene in a novel), Maurice Bendrix, is an unattached and highly available author, just starting to experience the first blush of artistic and commercial success.Sarah\u2019s marriage is tantamount to both loveless and sexless, but neither spouse feels any compulsion in the religious or moral environment of the time to seek a divorce.It is only Maurice\u2019s personal desire to legitimate his relationship that raises the question of marriage or divorce at all. Without this expectation, both relationships, the marriage and the adultery, the love triangle, give the impression they could continue in their original form until death do them part. The Denunciation of \"the Slut\"Both Sarah and Bendrix commit adultery. Yet, for decades, Sarah was painted as the worse adulterer in the public eye, the \"slut\" (perhaps the second greatest pejorative that can be attached to a woman?).While Bendrix simply coveted something that \"belonged\" to another man, Sarah was the one who had made a promise to love, honour and obey her husband. Her adultery, as opposed to his, involved the breach of a quasi-contractual promise, a God-sanctioned vow.In those times, and to some extent even now, that marriage vow was supposed to withstand the threat of temptation.The \"incompatibility\" of the wedded couple, the sexual or emotional attraction of another, neither was supposed to be enough to justify a breach of the vow. Marriage was sacrosanct and for life. Catholicism, in particular, forbade divorce, remarriage and the legitimation of a subsequent marriage. You had to make do with and in your first marriage.To Thine Own Love Be TrueNow, outside Catholicism, at least, it is difficult to see what all of the fuss was about. If they weren\u2019t Catholics, why didn\u2019t Sarah just get divorced? Why didn\u2019t Bendrix and Sarah get married, bonk themselves silly, have kids, bonk themselves silly post-kids and live happily ever after? Arguably, this is what must have been going through the mind of Bendrix, who when we meet him is an agnostic, if not an outright atheist.Looking through 21st century eyes, well, mine at least, there is a tendency to forgive both Sarah and Bendrix their \"sins\", because they were being \"true\" to their love. Even though Sarah was married, it was a loveless marriage. Didn't she have the right to fall in love with somebody else and act upon that love?\"The Bitch and the Fake\"The novel could have been couched in these relatively simplistic, if modern, terms. However, Greene took it a step further, by ensuring that Sarah ended the affair and did not break up her marriage to Henry Miles.Given that we know that this would happen from the outset, the focus of the novel becomes the question of how Bendrix (in the first person, and therefore we too, in the plural) will deal with his loss, which resolves down to the explanation for what Sarah did or didn\u2019t do. If Sarah wasn't a Catholic, what was her problem? Was her conduct even more culpable in our eyes, precisely because she ended the affair and didn\u2019t leave her husband? Was she actually \"the bitch and the fake\" she suspected she might be?While Sarah\u2019s real life contemporaries might have viewed her as a \"slut\" for engaging in the affair in the first place, when Bendrix\u2019 narrative commences, he too is full of hate for her. Like conventional, moralistic society, he's prepared to call her every foul word under the sun (\"slut\", \"bitch\", \"fake\"), because she turned her back on his love.Love Gone WrongFrom Bendrix' point of view, here were two people who appeared to have everything that was needed of a long-term or permanent relationship: emotional and intellectual compatibility, material comfort, sexual attraction and love. What went wrong?Of course, every man who has ever been rejected or dumped by a woman must believe that they bring the same qualities to the table or the altar. There can\u2019t be anything wrong with me. You, the woman, haven\u2019t loved me as I have deserved. You have cheated me. Or, perhaps the explanation is that, there is another man involved, some other card player who has trumped me in the game of love?So it is that, when we first meet Bendrix, we find him at the end of the affair, bitter and full of hatred.The Egotism of the MaleI found it interesting that, as a non-believer throughout the whole of the novel, Bendrix fills the hole left by the absence of God with his own presence. There is no greater authority, no moral force that is higher than the individual, himself. Bendrix is his own god. Before Sarah, he has only been sexually attracted to women who make him feel superior, women who, in effect, worship him. Like God, however, Bendrix the non-believer is a jealous god. There can be room for no one else in his version of love. He must remain the sole focus of Sarah\u2019s love. As I read on, I couldn\u2019t even fathom how family would be accommodated in this worldview. Their love had to be able to be expressed in the form of lust and sex at a moment\u2019s notice. Children would only get in the way of love.The Saintliness of the \"Slut\"In what might arguably be a clumsy plot device, Greene gives Bendrix access to Sarah\u2019s personal journal, in order to explain her motives to both him and to us.We learn that her love for this one mortal god was true, if not undivided. Sarah found herself in a predicament where she felt obliged to honour certain \"absurd vows\", and she did so. Like a saint, she suffered pain, she sacrificed what she loved, in order to prove a greater love. Ultimately, she did the right thing, even if she didn\u2019t do it exactly by the [good] book.The Paradox of HatredAt heart, Sarah\u2019s compulsion to honour her vows had a religious foundation, one based in the belief in the existence of a God. Bendrix derives some sort of comfort from knowing that he was genuinely loved, but, having learned to hate, he transfers his hatred to this God, in whom he had not previously believed.The paradox is that, in Greene\u2019s mind, you can\u2019t hate what does not exist. In order to hate God and what he had caused to occur, Bendrix had to will Him, God, into existence. Once it was established that He existed, it was equally possible to hate or love Him.Thus, while \"The End of the Affair\" is superficially a tale of a \"failed\" romance, if not just an affair that \"ended\", it seems at the conclusion that it might actually be the beginning of another love affair, that between Bendrix and the God of Catholicism.Choosing Which Vows to Honour and ObeyIronically, both Bendrix and Greene, male protagonist and author alike, wish to approach their God on their own terms. Having felt superior and godlike, they are reluctant to surrender their earthly, carnal privileges. God is holy and they must be obedient to Him, only to the extent that He allows them/us [males?] to indulge in love, romance, desire and sex on their/our own terms. The body is the vehicle through which you both have sex and worship God, hence a slight twist on the object of worship in the the marriage vow, \"With my body, I Thee worship.\"This compromise, this personalized version of a belief in God, your own God, remained vital in Greene and his fiction for the rest of his life. Presumably, in his own eyes, it allowed him to be \"closer my God to Thee\", if not necessarily closer to God\u2019s Church, its teachings, the Sacrament of Penance or the Rite of Confession, what Bendrix calls \"your bloody little box and your beads\".VERSE:\"They Call That Virtue and This Sin\"[After a Poem by Graham Greene]Who did dare to fashionWhat rules govern passion?What arbiter of tasteOr godly person facedThe challenge to decideWhich laws we should abide?Why does some God abovePrescribe how we must love,Adultery's a sin,Marriage should lock us in?What sex should be a vice,Though it feels very nice?May I remove your mask,Allow me, please, to ask,\"If it doesn't hurt you,Why's it not a virtue?\"\"The Third Woman\"My review of a book about the real-life adulterous relationship between Graham Greene and Catherine Walston, which inspired \"The End of the Affair\" is here:http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...SOUNDTRACK:Rilo Kiley - \"The Absence Of God\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkyBp...\"And Morgan says, 'Maybe love won't let you down.All of your failures are training grounds, And just as your back's turned, you'll be surprised,' She says, 'As your solitude subsides.'\"Rilo Kiley - \"The Absence Of God\" [Live Version]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqNwpm...Rilo Kiley - \"More Adventurous\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfAtMA...\"I'd sacrifice money and heaven all for loveLet me be loved, let me be loved...I've been trying to nod my head, But it's like I've got a broken neckWanting to say I will as my last testamentFor you to be saved and me to be brave We don't have to walk down that aisle'Cause if marriage ain't enoughWell at least we'll be loved.\""}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "[to relate how she prays for a miracle, \u201ccatches belief like a disease\u201d, and then subsequently dies.

Does it ever really end? I cannot answer these questions, nor will I try to. You see, for me, the end doesn\u2019t really matter. Why can\u2019t love be as it is and why must it end altogether? \u201c.. love had turned into a love-affair with a beginning and an end.\u201d quips Bendrix, the affair may end but love is different matter . Sometimes I think that people love endings because they fear the continuity of life. They crave the solidity of a construct with a beginning and an end. You\u2019re either happy or sad and that\u2019s it for you. And why shouldn\u2019t they? It seems such a reprieve from the pendulum of life that\u2019s ever in motion. Change is always feared. But does love change? Ah, that is the question. In the case of this novel, love changes its name into hate, the fine line between the two blurred by its very nature. What is that old clich\u00e9? The more you hate, the more you love? Yes, that one. \u201cHatred seems to operate the same glands as love; it even produces the same actions. If we had not been taught how to interpret the story of the Passion, would we have been able to say from their actions alone whether it was the jealous Judas or the cowardly Peter who loved Christ?\u201d The novel starts with the narrator\u2019s declaration that the book is one of hate. He delivers his promise and it is indeed filled with jealous, angry, and mistrusting episodes interspaced by small scenes of love. Of course, it is to be expected in a novel about an affair. After all, don\u2019t they say that evil begets evil? But is it really evil? If society edicts that sin is the transgression of the law, then I would agree that adultery is sin. But is it evil? Is it not good? Considering that this affair is one of love, how can such intense love be anything but good? A lot of people would say that this relationship is founded on a lie, so it cannot be then considered love. I disagree, love doesn\u2019t depend on backgrounds. Love takes root by itself between two people no matter who they are and what their circumstances. Okay, I do not condone love affairs. I believe that if you willingly vow to exclusively love someone till death then you should uphold it. But I think love, no matter what form, is never evil. It may be detrimental to others, but to give yourself so much to another can never be considered an act of evil. Why then did it change its name to hate? One cannot talk about this novel and disregard its association with a God. When the affair ended, as the title suggests, Bendrix focuses his attention on God. He blames God for its end, and though an unbeliever, he is haunted by his mistress\u2019s belief in God. Some say that Graham Greene was a little too pushy in his usage of God in the novel. To a certain extent I would agree, it was indeed a little disconcerting at times when the narrator would address God as You and casually talk to him in his mind. But then I realized that it was necessary as God was the only one he could lash out to. Henry, the mistress\u2019s husband was too likable a chap and too forgiving a man to hate. Also the two men would develop a weird bond which gave them comfort in its own way. Of course Bendrix owned up to saying that he hated himself, but he never really hated Sarah. God, omnipresent as they say, was forever available for condemnation and so it was that he undertook it with a vengeance. Bendrix needed an outlet for the intense feeling of love he had no way of showing, so he turned it into an intense hatred for God. Sarah\u2019s irrational belief in God irked him to a great degree, and that it was the cause of their separation intensified his hatred all the more. But then to hate something is to recognize its existence. How can one hate something that isn\u2019t there? Of course, one can hate an idea, but then one does not talk to an idea. With Bendrix\u2019s hatred grew a furtive unrecognizable relationship with God. He even admits to saying \u201cI hate You, God, I hate You as though You existed.\u201d It is really intriguing for isn't the greatest commandment for believers to love God? If so, then hating God is the the greatest sin. In the end, Bendrix offers a prayer to God saying: \u201cO God, You\u2019ve done enough, You\u2019ve robbed me of enough, I\u2019m too tired and old to learn to love, leave me alone forever.\"A prayer of surrender, a prayer that asks for desertion is a prayer nonetheless.In the end, he grew some semblance of faith from hatred. Hatred that originated from a love based on sin. If there ever was something that I would consider the prime idea that that one can interpret from the novel, it is the curious occurrence that something like faith would spring up from as vile a thing as hate. That adultery can pave the way for friendship. That something like sin can create love. That the end can lead to a beginning. Sometimes the ugliest things produce the ones most beautiful."}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "Love is in the air--or maybe anxiously repressed--in February and my romantic literature jag continues with The End of the Affair, the 1951 doomed romance by Graham Greene. This was my first exposure to Greene's fiction and while I was struck by the celebrated British author's intricate prose, keeping time like a Swiss clock, this novel is deficient in story, forgoing action for the reflections of its melancholy male narrator. These musings proceed from revealing to unceasing and finally, I just wanted The End of the Affair to end. The experience of reading this book was like listening to a 192-page voice mail message from an ex-boyfriend who hasn't moved on.The story begins on \"a wet black January night on the Common, in 1946\" with our narrator, successful novelist Maurice Bendrix, signaling a fellow Londoner he recognizes in the rain. The man is Henry Miles, a civil servant whose contribution, as Bendrix sees it, is moving from assistant secretary in the Ministry of Pensions to assistant secretary in the Ministry of Home Security. Bendrix invites Henry for a drink out of morbid curiosity for news of Henry's wife Sarah, his ex-lover who Bendrix hasn't seen since June 1944 and never gotten over. Bendrix is full of barely repressed antipathy, both for Sarah and her pathetic husband, but as an author, is valued by Henry as a listener.Unable or unwilling to consider that Bendrix's friendship with his wife might have developed into a love affair, Henry invites Bendrix to his home while Sarah is out for a walk. He confides that he's been deeply troubled by the fear that his wife might leave him. He shows Bendrix a letter in which a friend recommends a private detective. Bendrix offers to handle the transaction, musing \"Jealous lovers are more respectable, less ridiculous than jealous husbands. They are supported by the weight of literature. Betrayed lovers are tragic, never comic.\" Henry burns the letter and tells Bendrix to forget it, but the writer has memorized the Vigo Street address of the private detective.What an odd collection the trusted professions are. One trusts one's lawyer, one's doctor, one's priest, I suppose, if one is a Catholic, and now I added to the list one's private detective. Henry's idea of being scrutinized by the other clients was quite wrong. The office had two waiting-rooms, and I was admitted into one. It was curiously unlike what you would expect in Vigo Street--it had something of the musty air in the outer office of a solicitor's, combined with a voguish choice of reading matter in the waiting-room which was more like a dentist's--there were Harper's Bazaar and Life and a number of French fashion periodicals, and the man who showed me in was a little too attentive and well-dressed. He pulled me a chair to the fire and closed the door with great care. I felt like a patient and I suppose I was a patient, sick enough to try the famous shock treatment for jealousy.After his interview with the private detective, Bendrix returns home and is notified by his landlady that he received a call from Mrs. Miles. Meeting for lunch, Bendrix compels Sarah to join him at Rules, their old restaurant. Sarah asks Bendrix to look her husband up occasionally, concerned he might be lonely. Bendrix manages to keep his bitterness under wraps, advising her to see a doctor for a cough he observes. He notices a man with a young boy in tow watching him and upon returning home, Bendrix is called on by this man, whose name is Parkis and has been assigned by the detective agency to report on Sarah's coming and goings.Bendrix recalls being introduced to his beautiful and charming ex-lover by her husband, who he'd met at a party in the summer of 1944 and is curious to study for a future book. He invites Henry's wife to dinner for the purpose of picking her brain about her hapless civil servant husband. Walking Sarah down Maiden Lane to the tube station, Bendrix delivered a fumbling kiss without any expectation of going to bed with her. When the author invites Sarah to a screening of a movie based on one of his books, she comes without Henry. At dinner afterward, Maurice and Sarah fall in love over a bowl of onions.Exempted from military service due to a bad leg, the war in Europe becomes a backdrop for Bendrix's obsession for Sarah, which proceeds through the air raids on London in June 1944. The lovers share little concern of their passion being exposed to Henry, but is tempered by their realization that ultimately, the affair will come to an end. Mr. Parkis determines that Sarah has been stealing away to an apartment at 16 Cedar Road. Bendrix learns that the tenant is a street preacher named Richard Smythe. Studying a diary which Parkis gets his hands on, Bendrix discovers Sarah is hardly carrying on an affair with Smythe, but seeking spiritual salvation.He is jealous of the past and the present and the future. His love is like a medieval chastity belt; only when he is there, with me, in me, does he feel safe. If only I could make him feel secure, then we could love peacefully, happily, not savagely, inordinately, and the desert would recede out of sight. For a lifetime perhaps.If one could believe in God, would he fill the desert? I have always wanted to be liked or admired. I feel a terrible insecurity if a man turns on me, if I lose a friend. I don't even want to lose a husband. I want everything, all the time, everywhere. I'm afraid of the desert. God loves you, they say in the churches, God is everything. People who believe that don't need admiration, they don't need to sleep with a man, they feel safe. But I can't invent a belief.Graham Greene writes with precision in the way he considers jealousy, with the corporeal and spiritual costs of a romance in which nothing is ever enough for one man. Even when playing out against atmospheric conditions like the rain and fog on a London winter, or an air raid with V1 rockets raining down on the city during one rendezvous, the novel's busiest activity takes place in the souls of the lovers. This approach might be most satisfying to those who enjoy introspective novels. One paragraph at a time, the writing is often jeweled, making up for an inherent lack of drama with language that dances across the page.I am a jealous man--it seems stupid to write these words in what is, I suppose, a long record of jealousy, jealousy of Henry, jealousy of Sarah and jealousy of that other whom Mr Parkis was so maladroitly pursuing. Now that all this belongs to the past, I feel my jealousy of Henry only when memories become particularly vivid (because I swear that if we had been married, with her loyalty and my desire, we could have been happy for a lifetime), but there still remains jealousy of my rival--a melodramatic word painfully inadequate to express the unbearable complacency, confidence and success he always enjoys.Where The End of the Affair grows putrid for me is when soul searching like this ceases to serve as commentary on what the characters are doing and instead becomes all the characters are doing. This sums up most of the novel, unfortunately. Chapters started dragging for me as soon as Greene typed the word \"God\" and started going on explorations of human frailty in the Catholic sense, which seems more suited to a sermon than a novel. His characters are passionate and tormented, so the novel isn't lifeless necessarily, just tedious. The religious discussions made me feel like I was holding a chisel against my head and the author was hammering it.The film industry has returned to Graham Greene for material for nearly as long as there's been a film industry and The End of the Affair has been adapted to film twice. In 1955, a U.K. production directed by Edward Dmytryk starred Deborah Kerr as Sarah Miles, Van Johnson as Bendrix and Peter Cushing as Henry Miles. In 1999, Columbia Pictures mounted a version adapted and directed by Neil Jordan featuring Ralph Fiennes as Bendrix, Julianne Moore as Sarah Miles and Stephen Rea as Henry Miles. Perhaps intending to appeal to the same audience The English Patient, I far prefer that film's embrace of an affair during wartime rather than religious screed."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "Of Love and HateI first read this in 2007, and wrote a brief review on Amazon, which I reprint below. Reading it again now, ten years later, I very much stand by my original views and rating, but find myself fascinated by different things.======[2007 review] I wish it were possible to read certain books for the first time without knowing how they will turn out. But publishers seem to imagine that once a book becomes a classic (and this is one of Greene's masterpieces) the plot becomes common property. I read this in the Penguin Centennial edition, lovely to the eye and soft to the touch, yet the inside-cover blurb manages to reveal in two short paragraphs all the plot twists that Greene, as a master thriller writer, does not disclose until well into the second half of the book. You can see some reviewers on this site trying gamely not to let the cat out of the bag, but others (including the editorial reviews at the top) don't even try. So, if by some miracle you don't know how the novel turns out, stop reading NOW, buy the book, turn straight to page 1 without looking at the cover material, and enjoy. But fortunately, even if you do know the general outline, it is a finely written work of art which will give great pleasure anyhow.The title is unusually apt. How daring to start a novel, literally, with the END of an affair! From this point where a novel might normally finish, Greene's character Maurice Bendrix begins not only to recall the course of his affair with Sarah Miles, the wife of a dull neighbor in the civil service, but also to gnaw on that word \"end.\" Fueled by what he calls hate, but which we come to recognize as the obverse of his passion, he obsesses about how it ended, why it ended, and what happens after the end. Convinced that Sarah has left him for another man, he hires a private detective (Parkis, a surprisingly touching character) to follow her. Those who know Greene well may not find it hard to guess what Bendrix ultimately discovers, or that a rather sordid book about adultery would be transformed into a grueling challenge to the existence of God. It may in fact be the most explicitly religious of Greene's so-called Catholic novels, and too much for some readers, especially at the end. But it is a beautifully crafted work which never loses touch with the realities of this world (the Blitz, social conventions, physical sex) in its ultimate convergence on the next.======[2017 comments] This time, I was immediately struck by the brilliant opening. On the first page alone, it establishes several things: 1. That the protagonist, Maurice Bendrix, is a novelist, perhaps as close to Greene himself as he ever allowed.2. That he will choose a shape for his story almost arbitrarily, and tell it in an unconventional way.3. That, like  The Third Man, its immediate predecessor, it will take place in a noir world, heralded by \"the black wet January night on the Common\" with its \"wide river of rain\".4. That this story about an affair is \"a record of hate far more than of love.\"5. And, in the apparently throwaway line \"if I had believed then in a God,\" this book about adultery might turn out to occupy a different level entirely.It also struck me about how much Greene makes his points by their negatives. The obvious example is the love/hate dichotomy. I had assumed going in that any hatred would be just love under a different name, but I was quite surprised to find how much of it now seemed motivated, not by passion, but by meanness\u2014which is especially painful since you want to like and respect Bendrix as a near self-portrait of the author himself. But having read most of his other major works, I know that the theme of hatred as the prelude to love is an essential part of Greene's theology, when it comes to a love for God. The model, of course, is the conversion on the road to Damascus of anti-Christian zealot Saul into the Apostle Paul, after years of \"kicking against the pricks.\"But here again, Greene is deceptive. The \"if had known then what I know now\" convention has become a novelist's clich\u00e9, and Bendrix's line in the opening paragraph, \"if I had believed then in a God\" [italics mine], might seem to imply that the novel will be about the conversion of Maurice Bendrix. And yet that turns out to be a major thread of suspense, one that Greene deliberately leaves unresolved for the reader to write his own ending. To me now, it is even more interesting than the obvious question of why Sarah Miles broke off their affair.Reading again, I am more amazed than ever at Greene's technical audacity. We already know of his fondness for using a noir vehicle to deal with serious subjects. More interesting still is the way he uses the convention of the private detective to reveal inner truths as much as sordid facts. Then there are his tricks with time. He juggles three periods with consummate ease: just before the war when Maurice and Sarah first met, the war years in which they conducted their affair, and the postwar period well after the affair is over when Bendrix chooses to start his story. To start with the end, as I said before, is amazing in itself. But there is another end, even more surprising, that takes place two thirds of the way through; conventional novelists would have stopped there, but this is where Greene's true purpose, as a Catholic novelist (much like Evelyn Waugh), really begins. The way the five Books into which the novel is divided jump around by time and viewpoint is remarkable. The only thing I would criticize is the blatant device of having the detective enter the house and steal Sarah's journal as a way of having her tell part of the story in her own words\u2014though the actual content of those words is superb.The Penguin Centennial edition also has the benefit of a superb 16-page introduction by Michael Gorra. So so many book introductions, it gives a lot away, and so is best read as an afterword. But in that context, wow! Having twice read and twice reviewed this novel now, I thought I knew most of its angles. But Gorra is so thoughtful, so informed, so original in his own thinking\u2014and so open to the fact that many readers will not like the religious content in Greene's novel\u2014that reading him opens new vistas, and almost makes me want to start the book again, for the third time!======Finally, a shout-out for two other books. I found I had confused this in my memory with Elizabeth Bowen's The Heat of the Day. Her novel, also about an adulterous affair during the London Blitz, and also with noir-ish overtones, is described on its cover thus: \"Imagine a Graham Greene thriller projected through the sensibility of Virginia Woolf.\" The Greene connection is what made me confuse the two in my memory, but on reading it again in 2016, I realized that the Virginia Woolf comparison is much more apt. I recommend it to anyone intrigued by this apparently impossible combination.The second book is one of the few coffee-table volumes I have never regretted buying. Called Graham Greene Country, it has been my indispensable companion to Greene ever since I picked one up on remainder; it is well worth getting if you can find a copy second-hand. In it, the English illustrator Paul Hogarth visits the sites of every one of the author's novels (which surely involved a considerable amount of globe-trotting!), describing his explorations and filling the pages with sketches in brilliant color; the illustrations to this review are from Hogarth's book. The commentary is by Greene himself. As one of Greene's greatest strengths is his sense of place, the combination of artist and author is a knockout. Only the synopses of each novel, accurate though they are, are likely to be spoilers for those who have not read that particular book."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23315273-carol", "userReview": "I didn't love this novel as much as I understand I should, based upon views of my most erudite GR friends.

This book is more a record of hate, than of love, our central character, Maurice Bendrix tells us. Indeed, Bendrix is full of hate and anger, jealousy and spite. The novel begins in 1946, when Bendrix, an author, runs into Henry Miles on Clapham Common. Bendrix was having an affair with Henry\u2019s wife, Sarah; but she ended the affair, leaving Bendrix an embittered and obsessive lover.This is a novel which is so realistic, so full of pain and rage, that you almost want to turn away from the page. Indeed, Bendrix is very much an anti-hero, full of unlikeable traits. He loves Sarah and longs for her to call him, but, when she is with him, he immediately wants to start a row with her. He is selfish, unkind, hurtful and yet, what saves him as a character, is that he knows he is behaving badly. He is all too aware of how unfair he is and how desperately he loves Sarah. Henry Miles is an important, successful Civil Servant, who cares for Sarah, but the couple have long lost the romantic side of their marriage. However, Bendrix is unaware of the real reasons why Sarah left him and his attempt to discover the truth will lead to disaster. Although this sounds a very depressing and dark novel, it has some tragic-comic moments; most notably in the character of the private detective, Parvis, and \u2018his boy,\u2019 Lance. The novel also delves into some huge, and important themes; the destructiveness of jealousy, the strange, reciprocal relationship, that grows between Henry and Bendrix, religion, vows and success. Through it all, Graham Greene lays bare his characters, and, through them, himself, with painful clarity.

I want ordinary corrupt human love. Dear God, you know I want to want Your pain, but I don\u2019t want it now. Take it away for a while and give it me another time. I'm reeling in astonishment at this incredible work. Not only was Colin Firth's audio performance of this astounding (do yourself a favour and listen - you will be transported), but the WRITING, oh the writing of this perfect novel had me in the first few paragraphs, knowing that this book would be one of my new favourites. I found myself going back to the print version to drool over phrases and chapters that were lingering with me.This is the story of Maurice Bendrix, a man consumed with hatred. His lover Sarah had called off their affair two years earlier during WW2 (her reasons unknown to him) and he is steeped in bitterness. By chance, he runs into Henry, Sarah's husband, and it re-ignites his hate and jealousy, so much so he hires a private eye to spy on her.We learn all about the affair, how it began, and Sarah's reasons for ending it. The love story alone is so compelling. The descriptions of their love and desire for each other are gorgeous and painful. Bendrix is a jealous lover, who loses trust the moment she is out of his sight. Their love is double-edged and so real. So ordinary, corrupt and human. So beautiful.Sometimes I get tired of trying to convince him that I love him and shall love him for ever. He pounces on my words like a barrister and twists them. I know he is afraid of that desert which would be around him if our love were to end, but he can\u2019t realize that I feel exactly the same. What he says aloud, I say to myself silently and write it here.But to the tale of passion Greene adds in a spiritual dimension that blows the story sky-high, giving readers so much to mull over. What is faith, what is divine intervention? Does God exist and hear our prayers? To what extent will He go to confirm and inspire belief? Or is it all in our heads? There are many crises in this book - those of the heart and those of the spirit.

For those of us who\u2019ve known and experienced the myriad of challenges inherent to that form of love, this is an eerily familiar, often confronting read. Suffering, in this book, is very much a condition \u2013 and often a concomitant- for contentment, even happiness (however brief) and meaning to be derived from life. In spite of the creeping forces of nihilism, cynicism and relativism that beset the critically inclined, a deeper meaning \u2013 be it the unconditional, often trying love for a person or a God \u2013 has to be grasped and embraced in order to live fully. Whatever is mundane, convenient, or comes easy, spells certain (spiritual) death for those \u2013 often out of cowardice \u2013 consciously choosing it. Experiencing hurt, betrayal or disillusionment (which turns that love into hate) in that pursuit is a given. Yet, it beats the alternative, or so Greene seems to imply. Better to feel vibrantly alive once for a short while, than to feel an aching nothingness for one\u2019s whole stay in this earthly realm.This makes Greene a perennial writer, in my opinion. Those who attempt to dismiss his Catholic novels wholesale by mocking their religiously inspired situations (which are admittedly reaching at times) and imagery out of some sense of misplaced superiority, to me are missing the point somewhat. Greene\u2019s economical use of language, pregnant with meaning in what is a deceptively slim book very much made on impression on me. I found myself pensively underlining various passages, aphorisms and witticisms left and right, often with a grimace on my face. This man knows. By its deft employment, Greene brings to life the various complex states of mind of his richly drawn characters, especially the ones that compose the doomed couple entangled in an illicit love affair, Maurice and Sarah. They are both conflicted, flawed, even at times plainly pathetic individuals, stirring conflicting emotions regarding them in the reader himself. Here is a hate/love dynamic at work on two levels, which in the case of our protagonists inexorably leads to a conclusion suffused with sorrow. Only at the third part of the novel, do we the voyeurs, peering into their souls, truly understand where they are coming from, observe their frailty and weakness with coolly compassion, and find it in ourselves to forgive them for their trespasses of the heart.

It took a turn that I could not have imagined and then it became about so much more than just an ending of a love affair, it became about love itself, about hate, about jealousy and indifference. And it became about religion and about God, which is an entirely different thing than religion itself. I felt pain and confusion and sorrow and anger. I was Bendrix and then I was Sarah, and I understood and misunderstood them equally. Greene is a masterful storyteller with a complete command of his craft. He teases us with making Bendrix a writer and describing how he writes and fashions a story, but there is something beneath the description that mingles truth and mendacity, just as they are mingled in the persons of Sarah and Bendrix. As I watched Bendrix swing between love and hate, I thought of Janus the God with two faces and realized that love and hate are the same emotion turned on its head. Have you ever truly hated someone that you did not love? It is too strong an emotion to waste on someone to whom you have been otherwise indifferent. It springs from love in the face of betrayal or severe disappointment, and it is love morphed into another guise and, as such, it can morph back again.I was initially confused about the relationship between Bendrix and Henry, but I do think that when we love and lose someone we feel tied to those who have also loved and lost. In the end, we control so little of what is truly deep emotion in us. Trying to control it is as futile as battling with God.

I guess it\u2019s all part of that growing up or maybe an extension of being cheap or maybe I just felt that wine was a more worthy purchase. Who knows. Every now and then, I get a book that some patron has felt the need to mark up. I\u2019m not a fan of doing this myself and if it\u2019s done to the hilt, I\u2019m usually pretty peeved, but when it\u2019s subtle, I\u2019m slightly amused. I like to lurk. Okay, not really, but I find it interesting to see what someone has considered important enough to take the step and destroy public property over. When I picked up The End of the Affair, the book immediately fell open to page 30, as though someone had purposefully bent the paperback to that spot and this line was marked:\u201dWhat have we all got to expect that we allow ourselves to be so lined with disappointment?\u201dHuh. Okay. That\u2019s a valid question. I suddenly craved the smell of a clove cigarette. Go figure.

Right from the start, you, the reader, can feel the bitterness of the narrator. It oozes like foul belly button drainage. Can you imagine? Try. It\u2019s not like I went into it expecting a love story, right? I\u2019d be stupid to think that. The damn title is The End of the Affair after all.

The murmurings of love that is often lost after a day or two or the stinging insults? Life\u2019s too short, people. Hate carries such power, resentment and blame fuels it. We don\u2019t want to admit that we had a part in it and instead focus on the other parties. Whether that be a scorned lover or a false God. Okay, this is getting too deep for me.

The same question I raised when I read De Profundis by Oscar Wilde or Brokeback Mountain by Annie Proloux. Forbidden love. Be it about gay love or illicit affair of a married person to a single one or between two married people, it is love and who are we to question about it? People fall in love. Sometimes with a wrong person or at a wrong time. Sometimes, they were victims of circumstances and they did not even mean to fall in love at all. So, why judge them? As long as they are legal age and they know what they are doing, it is their life and body. So, guys have some respect.The End of the Affair is exactly like that. It is a forbidden love between a married woman, Sarah Miles and a struggling writer, Maurice Bendrix in London amidst World War II. Sarah is married to an amiable civil servant Henry Miles. Henry is very amiable that even if he knows that his wife is having an affair, he keeps mum about it. The reason? He loves Sarah very much. One night, Sarah and Maurice are having sex in Maurice's apartment. Bombs are falling from the sky. One of those hits Maurice's apartment. Scared and praying, Sarah says that if God spares Maurice, who happened to be in the adjacent room (resting from having sex probably), she will stay away from him (as a form of repentance?). With blood on his face, Maurice shows up to the naked Sarah in the bedroom. From then on, Sarah makes good of her promise despite her love for him.The writing is sad and gloomy. It reminds me of the pain C. S. Lewis poured out while he is writing his memoir, A Grief Observed. It is as if Greene opened up his heart and all the reader could find are pain and sadness. Pain of being dumped by the woman he loves. Pain of having been left alive when the woman is taken back by God to His fold and seems to be working miracles on earth now that she is in heaven. Pain that the woman did not leave her husband when he is inviting her that they runaway and be free.A man pouring his heart out is something that takes a lot of courage to do. Considering that there really was Catherine Walston in his life, my hats are off to Greene. Besides, he did it beautifully. Amidst the war-torn London, a love so beautiful, albeit forbidden, is still a feeling to behold. The prose is taut, lyrical and passionate. Sarah calling out to God while having sex with Maurice seems trite, too melodramatic and unrealistic. Again, however, doesn't loving sometimes feel that way? Come on, guys. This novel is too good for you to pass up. Recommended for all people who love to love. But not for those who are currently nursing his/her broken heart as the feeling you will get from this book can compound the pain in your heart and you might decide to stay in the rain, get pneumonia and die like Sarah Miles just to stay away from your tempting ex-lover who wants you back. I would not want that despite my encouragement for you to read this book."}, {"userName": "Books Ring Mah Bell", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/372363-books-ring-mah-bell", "userReview": "Exquisite.This book has been on my currently reading shelf for a long time, and here's why: 6 pages in, I realized this read had potential to knock my socks off. I did not want to be interrupted by telemarketers calling to inform me my car warranty is almost up, the dog barking at whoever farted down the street, or my kid wanting me to be a parent. (CAN'T YOU SEE MOMMY IS READING!?!?!)So, I made a date with this book. I planned for it. I started drinking coffee at 4 in the afternoon, so I could stay up late. When the rest of my family was snoring, I ran the tub, poured a glass of wine and gave this book the attention it deserved.I can't say I liked the characters all that much, but I felt the jealousy of Maurice. The conflict, the love, the hate between them resonated somewhere deep in my soul. There were so many lines in this book that had me nodding in agreement, \"YES! I have felt that way!\" and the whole book would have been underlined had I brought a pen into the tub with me. Instead, I dogeared the hell out of it. What Graham Greene has written is a triumph. A timeless masterpiece for the tormented souls who dare to love."}], "description": "\"A story has no beginning or end: arbitrarily one chooses a moment of experience from which to look ahead...\"\"This is a record of hate far more than of love,\" writes Maurice Bendrix in the opening passages of The End of the Affair, and it is a strange hate indeed that compels him to set down the retrospective account of his adulterous affair with Sarah Miles.Now, a year after Sarah's death, Bendrix seeks to exorcise the persistence of his passion by retracing its course from obsessive love to love-hate. At first, he believes he hates Sarah and her husband, Henry. Yet as he delves further into his emotional outlook, Bendrix's hatred shifts to the God he feels has broken his life, but whose existence at last comes to recognize.", "title": "The End of the Affair", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29641.The_End_of_the_Affair", "average": 3.96, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328010344l/29641.jpg", "reviews": 3387, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2533.Graham_Greene", "name": "Graham Greene"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11271.Monica_Ali", "name": "Monica Ali"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Romance", "Audiobook", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29641.The_End_of_the_Affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394731.The_End_of_the_Affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13641539-the-end-of-the-affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1287447.The_End_of_the_Affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/883217.The_End_of_the_Affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28141126-the-end-of-the-affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13034070-the-end-of-the-affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3698.The_Quiet_American", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3690.The_Power_and_the_Glory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3692.The_Heart_of_the_Matter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133394.Our_Man_in_Havana", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48862.Brighton_Rock", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
