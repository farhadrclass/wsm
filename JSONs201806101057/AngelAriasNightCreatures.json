Though it wasn't what I'd call dreadful, it just held none of the stuff that made the first book so exciting, dark, gritty and sexy. There's a general mood in Burn Bright that the author very cleverly builds up throughout, it's a mood that emphasises the dark, dingy world of the novel, but also creates a very sexual feel too.I think part of this book's problem is that it is not set in Ixion, and let's be honest, that's where all the fun happens. Another matter that I've already mentioned to a couple of GR friends is a theory I have about the author's decision to write a trilogy. I just don't think she had enough material to do so, and I don't mean in a bad way, I mean in a way that sometimes two books are exactly what is needed to tell the story that needs to be told perfectly. I think this is a trilogy because trilogies are so in vogue right now (either that or it's a moneymaking scheme).If my theory is correct, when the third book arrives it will probably be the exciting conclusion to the first book that the fans were hoping for. Angel Arias, however, felt like a very poor way of bridging the gap between book one and book three. In the first book the problem is established, in the last book it will surely be solved... in this one our characters basically dawdled and pretended to be finding out something - the things they were finding out could have actually just taken a chapter in the next book.It's likely I will read book three in order to find the closure I need from this series and I think it will pick up once we return to the Ixion setting. I hope my theories are correct because I took next to nothing from Angel Arias."}, {"userName": "Braiden", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4317431-braiden", "userReview": "I was so ecstatic when Marianne asked if I would like an uncorrected manuscript of Angel Arias. I want to first say thank you to Marianne as well as the crew at Random House Australia for giving me the chance to read it in advanced. And now, from what I see so far\u2026 nobody has been disappointed in this sequel to Burn Bright. As Burn Bright is currently only available in Australia \u2013 for the moment at least \u2013 I am not going to go into too much detail about the plot of Angel Arias. It\u2019s best that you get a copy of Burn Bright first and be wound up in this original and captivating story yourself.Rather than being set predominantly on Ixion, the island of freedom and eternal pleasure like Burn Bright was, Angel Arias brings us back to Grave. We previously saw a glimpse of Grave at the beginning of Burn Bright, where Retra \u2013 now Naif \u2013 was escaping to Ixion to find her brother Joel. But this time, we are given the chance to see the environment, the restricted and controlled Seal Compound that Retra/Naif was raised in. She returns to try and discover if there\u2019s a connection between what\u2019s been happening on Ixion and her home island of Grave, and to ultimately save her friends and brother who are still on Ixion.Naif continues to evolve. In Burn Bright, she transformed herself completely to fit in with everyone on Ixion, leaving behind her past. However, this time Naif solitarily questions Grave, its authorities, and her upbringing to uncover the realities and truths of her world \u2013 and of her life. On this journey we are introduced to many more new faces. There was one character in particular, Jarrold, that I really grew to admire. Most likely because he constantly risked his young life to help Naif. Also partly because I wish when I was at that age, that I was as adventurous, intelligent and bold as he was. We are also presented with a new type of creature, separate from the already known night creatures. These new creatures although initially mysteriously anonymous, and encountered with caution and uncertainty, developed into endearing allies despite of their physical features. Learning about the causes of how they came to be like that and got those physical attributes was fantastic. Marianne did a splendid job at introducing us to all these new characters, and weaved them into this plot flawlessly well.I really want this world that Marianne de Pierres has conjured in the Night Creatures series to be known and shared by all. I hope soon that all of you \u2013 whether your American, British, Canadian, Indian, French, German, or even an inhabitant of the North Pole \u2013 get to experience this world as us Aussies have been lucky to be captivated in, and for some, twice already. Grave felt just as real as Ixion and you\u2019ll be thrown into the story along with Naif to find the truth behind the truth. Angel Arias is a captivating sequel that outdoes its predecessor \u2013 well, for me at least.~~~~~~~~~~~~All I\u2019m going to say for now until I do publish my review in a few weeks time, is that I loved it heaps more than Burn Bright if that\u2019s possible. SO much more you learn about Grave/Seal and each society as a whole, old and new characters <3, and just all out pure greatness.Got sent manuscript from Random House Australia and Marianne de Pierres. Full review published in a few weeks time. Look out for it! Mark your calendars people as this is one book you don\u2019t want to miss!"}, {"userName": "Nomes", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3842653-nomes", "userReview": "Angel Arias starts right after where Burn Bright left off ~ and it begins with the same dynamic energy that Burn Bright burned with ;) But where Burn Bright was mysterious, the world and plot swirling around the reader, Angel Arias has a different tone. It has an urgency and plenty of action, but this time Naif (Retra) is much more sure of herself.The plot in Angel Arias is ambitious, secrets are revealed, unveiling more mysteries which showcase extraordinary world building: the world Marianne has created is intricate yet accessible. It's a daring kind of read, and just as original in flavour as the first book in the series. The scope of the book is fantastic (from time with the pirates, and seeing more islands), and I think the plot is best explored with no idea where it is heading (no spoilers here).Aussie author Marianne de Pierres has a talent for throwing her readers alongside her characters in such a way that you are kept on your toes: the action is blended beautifully with plot twists and developments, the reader discovers things alongside the protagonist. There is foreshadowing, creating tension and atmosphere, but not clue-ing the reader in enough to make the plot predictable. It was the opposite. I was constantly on edge, even questioning the loyalties of certain characters, friends who suddenly seem like foe and enemies who have shades of goodness shining through.I loved the larger scope of the book and yet somehow I missed that gothick-y vibe of Ixion (I am nostalgic by nature, haha). I cannot compare reading the first book in the series to read Angel Arias. I think I was so startled in my love of Burn Bright , like the first taste of chocolate, it was addictive, startling and delectable. Angel Arias did not stun me in the same way despite still being driven by that intoxicating vibe that made it impossible to put down.It is not the kind of book I am normally drawn to (action, worlds, secrets ~ I am more often drawn to books that are less plot-driven, more character-driven) so perhaps I did not enjoy this as much as I *should* have. I think my enjoyment is more indicative of my tastes as a reader than the quality of this book. This is a book to enthral and ignite imaginations. Despite my wishing for more depth in the characters (with personal motivations, relationships) it is obvious the author cares for her characters (yet also has no qualms about putting them in harms way).A small teaser: I was (incredibly, delightfully) pleased when the story suddenly swivelled, giving readers a taste of Lenoir's POV! A real surprise, it widened the scope of the story, and also, Lenoir is one enigmatic guy, so it was enlightening being inside his head)."}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "Completely Addicting!Angel Arias is the second installment in the Night Creature series and I have to say Marianne de Pierres sure knows how to world build and create a dark and compelling setting that has you sitting at the edge of your seat! Great addition to the series that has me excited to see how this story unfolds. In Angel Arias Retra, now called Naif, travels back to Grave with her fellow run-away Markes to try and find a way to reverse the effects of the badges they got on Ixiom which is shortening their lives. Ixiom is in turmoil and the Ripers that watch over the runaways and enforce the rules are not what they appear to be. They\u2019ve been seen back at Grave talking to the Elders. So Naif and Markes head back in the hopes of discovering what the Ripers and Elders are conspiring and how they can save their friends back at Ixiom. In their quest, they learn that Angel Arias is the night song that plays to let the run-aways of Grave know when the barge is coming to lead them to Ixiom. But who controls that song? Who is truly luring them to Ixiom and for what purpose?It was great to see Naif\u2019s character continue to grow in this story and become the strong, quiet leader that intrigued me in the first book. In Angel Arias she continually takes risks and pulls through for her friends to help them survive the dangers of Ixiom. I was confused about her relationship with Markes as opposed to Lenoir, but I\u2019m certain that was purposeful on de Pierres part. I\u2019m really curious to see the direction she is headed with these three main characters. The new set of secondary characters where a great addition to the story. Perfectly done!I won\u2019t offer any spoilers, but I will say Wow! Just wow! I did not see that coming until the final hour. What Naif and Markes discover at Grave is sure to cause an explosive conclusion.

She has several great series out, and this, her second book in her Young Adult series is one I recommend whole heartedly. What I love most about this series so far is the constant action going on. Right from page one you are thrown into this fantastic world of light and dark, creatures and pirates. Naif is one of the best main characters to have, as she is very sympathetic to all of them and their struggles to try to just exist in such a complicated world, with so much anarchy and politics happening. I have been meaning to post this review since I read the book on it's release day and just like the first book (Burn Bright) I read through it so fast that I feel that I need to go back and re-read them immediately to catch everything I missed in my fierceness. As Lenoir tells Naif \"Times are Dangerous\" it's so true. There is not one island that is not going through some kind of turmoil. What I would really enjoy to see is if this series takes off and we get to see Naif or other characters travel to some of the other places we have not seen yet. Visit the people and the way they live and interact would be awesome. This is the first series that I have seriously considered doing some fan fiction for, it speaks to me that much. My absolutely favorite character in this book was Liam. I am so interested in how the night creatures interact with each other. How they view the world as a creature and of course what they have been through. Besides the fast pace of the story and the new characters introduced, seeing the Island of Grave through both Naif's and Markes's eyes was like hearing about 2 different places. Naif's childhood was so locked-down that Markes seemed to have lived on a whole other island, so as we travel through Markes' hometown and the difference between the two was so imaginative all on it's own. I really could not have any more hype for a series of books that this one. I am a complete fan-girl of Marianne De Pierres and completely encourage all to sign the petition to help bring these books worldwide!Direct Link here http://www.strangemore.com/2011/07/in..."}, {"userName": "Rebecca \u2665 Warner, Kishan, Magnus \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/703854-rebecca-warner-kishan-magnus", "userReview": "This felt very short and simple compared to Burn Bright, but it has been so long since I read it I might be remembering it wrong. This was just a single mission back into the city to find out how the elders are involved with Ixion. We got to know Markes a whole lot more in this book, and I liked him for the most part. Lenoir was hardly in it and he and Naif never met up so we were able to focus on Markes and see if anything would happen between him and Naif. They clearly like each other but Naif is still caught up on Lenoir. And at the end it seemed that Markes was a little mad at Naif, and Naif was mad at Lenoir, so who know what will happen there. And most confusing of all is the blurb for Shine Light which called Lenoir Naif's one true love. I really didn't think it had come to that yet. It was a blood bond and a physical attraction. I didn't think it was more than that. But perhaps the rest is still to come. I am excited to find out since I will usually choose the more complicated of two love interests, and that is definitely Lenoir.Speaking of Lenoir. He is an alien. Somehow I totally missed that in book 1. I had no clue what he was but I was leaning towards demon. But he referred to his \"home world\" more than once, as if I should have already known. We met a lot of new characters in this book. I really enjoyed Jarrold. He was so helpful and did all kinds of crazy stuff to help Naif. I cant believe he got away with it all. Such a daredevil. I really did not like Emilia though. What a big baby. I hope she is not in book 3 too much. And I think Markes deserves better. Even if Naif chooses Lenoir, I hope Markes does not end up with Emilia. So I don't know how this series will conclude but I only have one book left and I will read it soon."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250501-crystal", "userReview": "Thanks Arlene!!I have learned in the past that quite a few second books in a trilogy are filled with filler and a little bit story. Well Angel Arias is a huge exception to that rule. This second book in what is quickly becoming my favorite trilogy delivers an explosive storyline and darkishly delicious characters.The story picks up where Burn Bright left off with Naif, Markes and Charlonge leaving with Ruzalia, the pirate captain. They quickly learn that things aboard the ship are not as quiet as they seem and soon they are faced with a revolt that they want nothing to do with. Running to save their own lives Naif realizes that she has to go back to Grave to help save everyone that she loves. Going back may be the one thing that kills Naif for good though.I just fell right into this story. I finished Burn Bright a few months ago and the story stayed with me long enough that I had no trouble picking this one up and knowing exactly what was going on. These characters are so real and flawed that you can\u2019t help but feel for them. Naif has a long way to go but I think that by the end of the last book she will finally learn who she is and I think that moment will be pure awesome. Marianne de Pierres had me guessing the entire book. I really cannot wait for the next installment! Angel Arias does end in a cliff hanger and my oh my is it a biggie. What comes to life at the end changes everything and I am wondering which is a worse place to be Ixion or Grave. Lenior is still a mystery to me and I am really wondering how his relationship with Naif will play out. I am really hoping that we get to see more of this creepy monster in the third installment. Fans of Burn Bright will love this book. I really hope this series will be published in the US. They would definitely be a wonderful addition to the YA bookshelf.

Doch auch dort ist es nicht sicher. Zwar rettet diese die Leute vor dem Tod in Ixion, aber ihre Zeit l\u00e4uft trotzdem davon - fr\u00fcher oder sp\u00e4ter verlangen die Manipulationen, die bei der Ankunft in Ixion vorgenommen werden, ihre Opfer. Nicht jeder ist dankbar und der Zorn richtet sich auch auf die drei Freunde, die Ruzalia n\u00e4her stehen zu scheinen. Ohnehin kann Naif nicht lange bleiben - sie ist fest entschlossen, nach Grave zu kommen und herauszufinden, welche Gesch\u00e4fte die Riper und die Elder verbindet - trotz der Gefahr, die ihr auch dort droht.Okay, was war das jetzt? Ich hatte ja schon mit Band 1 meine Probleme, hoffte aber, dass Band 2 ein bisschen was wieder gutmachen kann \u2013 Pustekuchen. \u201eAngel Arias\u201c hat mich haupts\u00e4chlich ge\u00e4rgert, aber warum? Nun, ich werd\u2019s euch gerne verraten: Fangen wir einfach mal mit dem gr\u00f6\u00dften \u00c4rgernis an: Mir fehlte es ein bisschen an Logik beziehungsweise gesundem Menschenverstand. Nur um die Basis abzukl\u00e4ren: Naif hat zwei Tage in Grave Zeit, um einige Dinge zu kl\u00e4ren, f\u00fcr die dieser Zeitraum eigentlich ziemlich gering ist \u2013 zumindest wenn man herk\u00f6mmlich nach Spuren und Hinweisen sucht und dabei untergetaucht bleiben muss, weil man sonst weggesperrt wird. Zwei Tage sind also an sich schon verdammt knapp und unsere \u201eHelden\u201c haben nichts Besseres zu tun, als zimperlich zu sein (die Situation ist verdammt ernst, Leute, da ist kein Platz f\u00fcr sowas!) und gleich mal den ersten Tag beinahe komplett zu verplempern. Dass der zweite Tag wirklich sinnvoll genutzt wird, davon kann auch nicht immer die Rede sein. Genauso wenig kann ich behaupten, dass Naif nach den Antworten sucht, die sie finden will \u2013 im Grunde weist jemand anders sie zu den richtigen Leuten, die ihr praktischerweise den richtigen Ort mitteilen k\u00f6nnen, an dem sie die richtigen Informationen erh\u00e4lt und zuf\u00e4lligerweise findet dieses Treffen noch innerhalb der Zeitspanne statt, die sie haben. Klingt langweilig? Ist es auch.Lustigerweise ist es ausgerechnet Naif, die sp\u00e4ter anderen sagt, sie sollen nicht so tr\u00f6deln oder zimperlich sein. Vielleicht hat sie ja doch auch ihren Fehlern gelernt. Andererseits: Wer im Glashaus sitzt, sollte nicht mit Steinen schmei\u00dfen, oder?Mein pers\u00f6nlicher St\u00f6rfaktor Nummer 2 ist Markes, von dem ich nicht einmal mehr wei\u00df, welche Haarfarbe er hat oder ob so ein Detail jemals erw\u00e4hnt wurde. Nicht dass ich etwas gegen ihn pers\u00f6nlich h\u00e4tte \u2013 nun, eigentlich schon \u2013, mich \u00e4rgert vielmehr Naifs pl\u00f6tzliches Interesse an ihm. Ich meine damit nicht mal, dass es mir unverst\u00e4ndlich ist, wie man jemanden, der so feige ist, auch nur ansatzweise interessant finden kann. Der Kerl w\u00fcrde wenn m\u00f6glich seine Freunde allein auf eine gef\u00e4hrliche Reise gehen lassen, h\u00e4lt durchaus wichtige Informationen zur\u00fcck, was andere in ziemliche Gefahr bringen kann und sein Grund, nach Ixion zu gehen, hat endg\u00fcltig daf\u00fcr gesorgt, ihn gedanklich in die Kategorie der A\u2026.l\u00f6cher einzuordnen.Aber gut. Sie realisiert das alles zwar, aber wenn sie das nicht st\u00f6rt \u2026 Man kann in ihren Augen ja auch ruhig mal kostbare Zeit verstreichen lassen. Was soll\u2019s. Ich frage mich aber, woher das Ganze auf einmal kam. Ja, sie war in Band 1 ein bisschen an ihm interessiert, aber auch nicht so sehr, dass ich es als Verliebtheit wahrgenommen h\u00e4tte. Lenoir war da beispielsweise sehr viel pr\u00e4senter. Hier aber kriegt sie regelrechte Eifersuchtsanwandlungen, wenn sich andere M\u00e4dchen um ihn k\u00fcmmern \u2013 das w\u00e4re durchaus verst\u00e4ndlich, wenn ihre Gef\u00fchle von Anfang an Sinn machen w\u00fcrden. Es wirkte vielmehr wie das typische \u201eEr ist der einzige Mann in der N\u00e4he, also ist er jetzt einfach mal mein Erw\u00e4hlter\u201c. Das hilft der Geschichte aber auch nicht weiter!Aber genug gemeckert, \u201eAngel Arias\u201c hatte ja nicht nur schlechte Aspekte, wenn auch gen\u00fcgend. Die Autorin f\u00fchrt ein paar neue Charaktere ein, von denen einige auch ziemlich interessant und liebensw\u00fcrdig sind, so zum Beispiel Liam, der mit seinen ganz eigenen Problemen k\u00e4mpfen muss, oder Jarrold, mit dem man ganz sicher so einige Abenteuer erleben k\u00f6nnte.Genauso gibt es neue Informationen, auch wenn die Welt noch lange nicht so \u201edicht\u201c ist, wie ich mir das w\u00fcnschen w\u00fcrde. Allerdings gibt\u2019s gen\u00fcgend Input bez\u00fcglich einer recht gro\u00dfen Intrige, die im zweiten Band nat\u00fcrlich nicht weiter behandelt wird, sonder dann erst im 3. Band wirklich Wurzeln schlagen kann. Ich pers\u00f6nlich hoffe ja, dass auch die Riper dann endlich nicht nur n\u00e4her, sondern nah beleuchtet werden; bisher wird man nur mit kleinen Informationen angef\u00fcttert.Diese gibt es \u00fcbrigens nicht von Naif, sondern teilweise von Lenoir selber, der seine eigenen Kapitel bekommt, damit wenigsten ein bisschen von dem mitgeteilt werden kann, was in Ixion vor sich geht. Diese waren definitiv die interessantesten Kapitel des Buches, die mir richtig Spa\u00df gemacht haben. Zu dumm nur, dass es nur zwei davon gibt.Insgesamt reicht das wirklich nicht aus, um die zuvor angesprochenen, gro\u00dfen Kritikpunkte wieder auszumerzen. Und da kann eine Geschichte noch so angenehm geschrieben sein \u2013 wenn ich mich st\u00e4ndig \u00fcber die Protagonistin \u00e4rgern muss, dann wird das nichts, so sehr ich mir das auch gew\u00fcnscht h\u00e4tte.Man sollte Naif demn\u00e4chst vern\u00fcnftig denken lassen, bevor sie etwas macht, dann wird der n\u00e4chste Band vielleicht auch ein bisschen spannender. Mehr Informationen k\u00f6nnen auch nicht schaden, aber immerhin kam dieser Punkt nicht allzu kurz im zweiten Band.Bei Band 3 werd ich wohl erst mal ein paar Rezensionen abwarten \u2013 wenn alle begeistert sind, lohnt es sich vielleicht doch noch ein bisschen, neugierig bin ich ja schon, wie sich alles aufl\u00f6st. Wenn nicht, dann war\u2019s das hiermit mit mir und der Night-Creatures-Reihe."}, {"userName": "Brittany (Nice Girls Read Books)", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/769085-brittany-nice-girls-read-books", "userReview": "What a great follow-up to Burn Bright! Fans of the first book will not be disappointed. Naif and her friends return, unearthing more dark secrets about the strange island of Ixion - and unfortunately for the young rebels that fled to the island in Burn Bright, these secrets are more menacing than they ever could have imagined! Fans of dystopian fiction should not pass this series up!Much like the first book, Burn Bright, Angel Arias took a little while to really 'lift-off' for me. I read the first handful of chapters in small doses, but it wasn't long before the real action and intrigue kicked in! Needless to say, the last 200 pages were turned in a frenzy. It's a really hard book to put down once you become absorbed. I wasn't suprised at all, though, because Marianne de Pierres is just this sort of writer! She knows how to do action, how to pace things, and how to make everything come together perfectly.We turn away from Ixion in this book - other than a chapter narrated by Lenoir who still resides on the island - and instead face Sanctus (Ruzalia's island) and the sprawl of Grave North (Retra/Naif's original home). I must admit I wasn't pleased when I thought the story would be heading back to Grave, but once I was there the action and drama soon swayed me. We focus on the characters of Naif and Markes more than anyone else in this one. I quite enjoyed that, because I thought Markes took the sidelines in Burn Bright and I wanted to find out more about the musician and Naif's fascination with him. I like him much more as a character now, so that's good.We also meet some new characters; mainly Jarrold and Liam. Both were ones I liked immediately. They each add a new aspect to the story. Jarrold is a Grave resident, brother to Marke's former 'Trothed', Emilia. He's much like Naif's own brother, Joel, mixed with a dash of Rollo from Burn Bright. Liam, on the other hand, is revealed to be someone from Suki's past, and he's been one of those unlucky few that were joined with the Night Creatures on Ixion after being 'withdrawn'. I presume we're going to learn a lot more about him in the third book, Blaze Dark, and I look forward to it. I know there's an interesting story there.Marianne de Pierre's world-building skills are just as fantastic as ever. While reading, I felt completely immersed within the worlds Naif and Markes explored. I also really loved Jarrold's experience with the tunnels beneath Grave, and how they hinted at the end of our modern civilisation. The world of The Night Creatures series is very elaborate and lush, and I dare anyone not to fall in love with it.Angel Arias was a fantastic read - and fantastic sequel! The story develops further, things are revealed, characters evolve and new relationships are formed. It's everything you could hope for in a second book. I urge anyone to get their hands on this series if you haven't already done so.Recommended to: If you liked Burn Bright, you'll love Angel Arias. Definitely recommend this series to fans of dystopian YA. You will not be disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Isamlq", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4016030-isamlq", "userReview": "Well, the author has certainly got no qualms about putting her people in sticky situations. She\u2019s also very generous when introducing new characters who I felt just as interesting as the originals; Jarrold and Liam both had me imagining so many things! I look forward to the next one with a little more time with them. All said, Angel Arias didn\u2019t have me as pumped as Burn Bright. That may be because it\u2019s not in Ixion. Let\u2019s face it a place where anything goes is likely to grab then keep a body\u2019s attention, yes? This one with though is filled ducking and covering in places that brought out the girly-girl in me as in: *shudder.* Some of the descriptions, as in Burn Bright, were vivid just not as enamoring. It felt almost scarier, almost more disturbing than some of the things Burn Bright.Recall that I was very impressed with Burn Bright with its vivid world as well as characters that contributed. Book two has both these things, but strangely, I\u2019m just not as in love with it. I do have to point out that I enjoyed the direction some of the characters went. Markes and Lenoire especially had me paying more attention. It was refreshing to see things from the Lenoire\u2019s side. Then things got even more interesting to see more of what made Markes Markes. Revelations here made for a more complications in Naif\u2019s already overly-complicated life. I mean just consider her connection to Lenoire. Then consider her connection to Markes. Then don\u2019t discount the promises she\u2019d made to herself then to her friends. See? Complicated. Yet, I like that she\u2019s so different from most everyone in the book. I also like that the others were not clueless about how different she actually was.

I did enjoy seeing my favourite characters again, however momentarily. I enjoyed hating Markes all over again and I really wanted to see more of Lenoir, Rollo, Suki. I really liked the characters, especially Naif (though I really liked her personality change in the first one, better than this one), Rollo, Lenoir, Jerrold. What I was a little disappointed about was the plot. Now, it wasn't bad. But it wasn't outstanding either. Burn Bright had smexiness. It had darkness and mystery. Angel Arias doesn't have that dark glitter and I was disappointed. But in saying that I still read through it, which meant, compared to some other sequels I know of, it was still pretty damn good. It's still good in the sense that there is action and hidden motives, even without the glitter, it still shines with enough light to make me crave even more the next book - Shine Light - which I can not wait to read. I definitely want to know how it ends. I am strangely really interested in Lenoir as a character and possible love interest for Naif. I'm actually quite surprised by the lack of romance. I actually prefer it. I like the focus on the other events, and I like that the lack of in this novel means that there's enough tension present for the next one. I really don't like Markes. It's like he's being presented as this innocent nice guy yet what he does is always so assholish, yet from the writing, you just don't get the feeling that Naif cares that he acts in such a way. Naif, for heavens sake, please do not get together with Markes in the next one, unless I am presented with a really, really, really good reason, or by some miracle Markes happens to choose Naif over his other two ladies, then I will crack the shits. Man, I really am getting worked up about this little mess. Wow. Well, whatever, Lenoir is much more interesting character than Markes. Markes next to him is a pale imitation of someone fascinating. I'm actually quite interested in Pierres's decision to create Markes as a character who's, well, the non-masculine of masculine heroes. Ugh, does that make sense? No, what I mean is that he's not like the other males who placed opposite the main female protagonist. He's kind of wimpy, kind of normal, kind of likable yet unlikable. He's not brooding or dark or angst. Which is why despite the fact that I might not like him, I still cannot help but like him.

I think that the way that Naif deals with being back in the Grave\u2019s oppressive environment and seeing the consequences of her decision to run away to Ixion reveals the strength of her character. Markes helps Naif in this journey a lot and we get to see a stronger, more confident side of him that was lost within the splendour of Ixion. I really hope there is a happy ending in the next book for them both!The new characters in this book are wonderful and provide an excellent counterpoint to Markes and Naif \u2013 Liam is especially endearing (and creepy, yes) and I love Jarrold. I\u2019m not sure about some of the other characters, but I think that has more to do with Naif\u2019s biases than my impressions of them. However, no one can replace Suki\u2019s vivacity and Rollo\u2019s good naturedness, and I keenly felt their absences right along side Naif. Her bond to Lenoir allows readers to glimpse what is happening back at Ixion, but nothing is clear and I am looking forward to getting back to the island in Shine Light.I had not expected this book to be quite as action-packed as it is, since Burn Bright was filled with descriptions of the wonder and splendour of Ixion and only ramps up at the end. Angel Arias is thrilling from the get go, and with everything progressing so quickly I forgot that the book only spans a few days, until the very end. It has answered a lot of the questions raised in Burn Bright, but has offered up many more for readers to contemplate before reading Shine Light.Engaging, thrilling and dark, Angel Arias offers us a wider glimpse into the world of the Night Creatures and is a must read for fans of Burn Bright. I am thoroughly enjoying this series and I think if you\u2019re not already reading it, then what on earth are you waiting for?

But, the internet rewards those who read, in the end.Although I think I liked the first novel in the series a little better, I still loved Angel Arias. I think Marianne de Pierres has a gift of combining the action, mystery, and YA appeal, while still keeping all the characters sane, involved, and full of integrity. Three things I loved about this book:1) Despite Retra's new predicament, Lenoir is still involved in this novel (who I disturbingly adore). All the characters are engaged and evolving, even as new ones come in and the story highlights some more than others. Very well done.2) The plot thickens. Some questions are answered, but more arise, layering deceit upon corruption upon betrayal. Oh yes, it gets good.3) I absolutely love love love Marianne de Pierres's approach to writing in terms of how her stories are organized near the end. Most authors use the traditional approach of mending a story after the climax. This is important for stand alone books especially, but also for series books. However, in a series, if you are so well concluded at the end and the climax was 100 pages before, then its not quite as excited. What Marianne does is she takes the climax up to the last page; you will still be on the highest point of adventure up to the very last word when you realize \"Bullocks, the next page is About the Author\".

In this book Naif tries to discover the secrets of Ixion and the part her home, Grave, has played.Now. I enjoyed this book more than the first one plot wise. It was just as fast, but it seemed more balanced that Burn Bright. The few problems I have are similar to my complaints during the first book. Not enough description. I mean, I love using my imagination, but sometimes my imagination wants a few quick pointers so I can actually see someone in my head.This series seems to be full of sexual abuse. See my review of Burn Bright for more information. I won't go into details because I don't much feel like it.I enjoyed Angel Arias more I suppose because there was less Lenoir, but at the same time I missed Suki, Rollo and even Joel.

Angel Arias h\u00e4lt kaum inne, um die Geschehnisse des Vorg\u00e4ngers Revue passieren zu lassen. Gerade mit den ungew\u00f6hnlichen Namen und ihren zugeh\u00f6rigen Besitzern hatte ich zu Beginn noch ein paar Erinnerungsprobleme.Retra alias Naif bleibt im zweiten Teil der Night Creatures Trilogie eine solide Protagonistin. Sie hat gleichzeitig schwache Momente und genug Mut, wenn es darauf ankommt. Ich habe zwar keine \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfigen Muttergef\u00fchle f\u00fcr sie entwickelt, aber es macht mir Spa\u00df sie durch die Welt von Ixion, Sanctus und Grave zu begleiten. Einzig ihre Verliebtheit kann ich beim besten Willen nicht nachvollziehen. Schon in Burn Bright f\u00fchlte sie sich von mehreren Jungen angezogen, was sie mehr verunsichert hat und wenig schlampig wirken lie\u00df. In Angel Arias konzentriert sie den Gro\u00dfteil dieser Gef\u00fchle auf Markes. Sie ist nicht blind vor Liebe, sie erkennt, dass der nicht der Tapferste ist und gern mal den Schwanz einzieht. Allerdings verzeiht sie ihm diese Charakterschw\u00e4che gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig, was vielleicht f\u00fcr ihren Charakter sprechen mag, Markes f\u00fcr mich aber alles andere als begehrenswert gemacht hat.Viel spannender ist da doch der Reaper Lenoir. Er hat es Naif und mir schon im ersten Teil angetan und zum Gl\u00fcck ist er trotz der Trennung von ihr auch in diesem Abenteuer nicht v\u00f6llig von der Bildfl\u00e4che verschwunden. Gro\u00dfes Highlight im Buch ist ein Kapitel, das komplett aus Lenoirs Sicht erz\u00e4hlt wird. Hier kann der Leser endlich direkt nach Ixion zur\u00fcckkehren, dem wohl spannendsten Ort in de Pierres Universum. Leider verfliegt die Zeit dort viel zu schnell und es geht zur\u00fcck ins karge Grave.\u201eLenoir activated his carriage, watching its metallic legs unfold and shudder upright, like a sleeping animal shaking itself awake.He climbed inside and settled on the plush velvet seat. He could still smell her in here; her blood and her secretions. Strands of her hair would be caught in the creases of the seat. He fought the desire to search for them.\u201d(p. 175)Naifs alte Heimat Grave ist der Haupthandlungsort des Romans. Sehr zu meiner Entt\u00e4uschung. Die Autorin hat sich zwar einiges ausgedacht, um diesen tristen Ort aufzupeppen, aber es ist eben nicht das gleiche wie das nachtfarbenfrohe Ixion. Ab und zu hatte ich sogar Probleme mit den Beschreibungen (Stichwort Br\u00fccke), sie waren einfach nicht einleuchtend genug um ein nachvollziehbares Bild vor meinen inneren Augen zu zeichnen. M\u00f6glicherweise lag das auch an ein wenig Vokabelmangel meinerseits.Die Handlung ist definitiv actionreich. Man kommt kaum zum Verschnaufen. Dennoch w\u00fcrde ich die Geschichte weder als fesselnd noch als erm\u00fcdend beschreiben. Irgendetwas fehlt einfach. Allein in Burn Bright gibt es genug offene Fragen und zu l\u00f6sende R\u00e4tsel. Leider brauchen Naif und co. bis zum Schluss, um endlich mal ein paar Antworten zu finden. Diese bieten dann auch eine gewisse Befriedigung und Neugierde auf den letzten Band in der Trilogie.Kurz und knappSchade, aber wahr: nach dem spektakul\u00e4ren Feuerwerk namens Burn Bright l\u00e4sst die Fortsetzung die Flamme ganz sch\u00f6n ins Flackern geraten.

If you havent read BURN BRIGHT yet, well go ahead and read it now! This is the second installment of the Night Creatures series and it is kind of different from the first book(in a good way). So Naif-once named Retra, escaped the war in Ixion, together with Markes and Char and with the help of Lenoir- a Riper who rescued her- she was able to get to Ruzalia's airship. But her brother Clash, Dark Eve and Rollo were left behind in Ixion where a war between the Ripers and the rebels are happening. Naif also found out something horrible back at Ixion, and she needed answers, to save the youngs from premature deaths and being eaten so she went to go back to Grave, the place where she came from before Ixion, the place where a Ripers have been seen talking to the Elders. Will truth be revealed? Will Naif find the answers in Grave before its too late? Having to be able to experience this adventure of Naif was overwhelming, I feared for her life while trying to escape her way out from those horrible hounds and wards, doubted her new found friends, thrilled with her feelings toward Markes, though I kind of wish it was Rollo or Lenoir, I think Markes will just break her heart in the end I don't know. Seeing him with Emilia made my heart ache for Retra.Anyway, about Naif's romance, it's still floating or atleast thats what I think, this book is more focused on her mission to get an answers and trying to survive from being caught by the Elders and being on time to get to their meeting place with Ruzalia. So expect a lot of heart-stopping, jittery moments. Again, I loved Naif/Retra's traits, she really transformed from a shy ignorant Seal girl to a something! And poor Liam, he is a sweetie pie, I really do hope that Suki is still alive! What else can I say, I just totally loved it, I cannot wait for the third book to come out! And this time I'm sure she'll be back to Ixion and then there's gonna be Naif, kicking someone's asses! But sadly it's going to be the last installment, the title is Blaze Dark out on 2012.

Soon after arriving in Ixion, she became entangled in the underground mysteries and evils of the place full of those in pursuit of pleasure. Through revisiting her past, she hopes to save her future.The second book in the Night Creatures trilogy holds onto what was so intoxicating about Burn Bright: the atmosphere. It perhaps even enhances it. It furthers the overall trilogy's plot arc but still presents its own storyline. The characters continue to develop, and new ones are introduced. Angel Arias pulls off The Middle Book perfectly.The setting was expertly created with an inherent gothic mood to it. I wouldn't call it dystopian, but more fantasy. Just not the kind of fantasy realm you'd want to be caught in. Marianne created an atmospheric world, creepy andThe plot was engaging in its unpredictable nature. The world and people presented in the Night Creatures series are so foreign to us that it's difficult at best to see what's coming. I also found myself pausing to admire the way Marianne didn't shy away from the difficult elements necessary for the terrifying setting. She had the courage to push her characters to the limit as well, which only furthered her brilliant characterisation.Even through third person narrative, Naif doesn't feel too distant from us. She's often conflicted and develops and changes so much, but her personality is still captured clearly in the narrative voice. The perspective switches very occasionally to other characters not present with Naif, and though these interludes give insight into what's happening elsewhere, they feel like an awkward blip in the smooth storytelling.The conclusion felt hard-earned by our characters, and wound down in perfect place to rest between adventures. I was definitely more satisfied by the conclusion than I was for Burn Bright, this time ending in a slightly calmer state. Without a cliffhanger, and I'm even more eager for the next installment.Burn Bright was a chilling and twisting tale of a world fallen into almost unimaginable decay and strong characters working to pick it back up again.

Naif must return to Grave to follow leads about a connection between Ixion and Grave and help Ruzalia discover who incited the dissention amongst those she rescued.This review is written with the assumption you have read book 1 (Burn Bright), spoilers will abound for book one but I will keep them to a minimum for this book itself.Lots of action in this book! I tore through this one in barely over 24 hours (and only took that long because I had to go to work ;p ). De Pierres writes great action scenes that really make you tense up and creep to the edge of your seat.It is a very interesting transition going from the sexy, dark party world of Ixion to Ruzalia\u2019s rundown port and back to Grave. There is a whole different feel to this book that accurately reflects the change in settings. What does it say about me as a person that I was more into this book than the first one? Should I be worried? ;pNaif is also a lot more fun as a character in this book, probably because this book is less about a Seal in party central awakening and more about a strong young woman trying to save her friends(and others she has a bizarrely complex relationship with).I loved some of the answers given in the book, more detail about the Uthers, some hints as to the story behind the Ripers. I definitely loved Liam too (I\u2019ll leave it at that to minimise spoilers).The next paragraph contains spoilers, ye be warned!One small thing that bugged me however was the tension let-down created by the scenes from Lenoir\u2019s POV. There is great tension as to whether Naif\u2019s friends have survived back on Ixion and through the course of these scenes we learn everyone is fine. Personally I would have preferred to have remained unaware they are safe so when Naif finally returns we get to be worried alongside her for the safety of Suki, Rollo and Joel. On the other hand though, these scenes gave us a lot of great insight into Lenoir and the other side of Ixion.Spoilers over.A great sequel, a must read for any who have read the predecessor, and if you haven\u2019t read the predecessor, go out and do so."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5501124-amanda", "userReview": "Angel Arias by Marianne de Pierres is the sequel to Burn Bright (my review). The blurb does a good job of summing up the book (although it might be a bit spoilery to those who are yet to read BB).While I enjoyed Burn Bright, I enjoyed Angel Arias a lot more, but I wasn't surprised because I often enjoy sequels because all the world building was done in the previous book and it\u2019s much easier to return to a world I've already visited. The story picks up right where Burn Bright finished, Naif has escaped Ixion leaving behind Lenoir and friends. She wants to return to Grave and find out what the Elders have to do with Ixion and the Night Creatures.Naif is such a fantastic lead character, despite being raised to be quiet and passive, she has really broken free of her former life and is now brave, kind, and determined. I was pleased to see Markes again and was eager for something more to develop between them, despite Naif's connection to Lenoir. Speaking of Lenoir, we are treated to a prologue from his perspective as well as a chapter towards the end of the book. I really liked the chance to find out his thoughts and feelings and was glad that Naif had him looking out for her.The story is action-packed with sinister undertones and this had me on the edge of my seat while reading. The world of Ixion and Grave is not a place I\u2019d ever want to visit as there are so many horrible aspects but I could understand Naif's need to protect her friends and do whatever was necessary.Being a middle book often means a lot of to-ing and fro-ing but not much plot progression but I was happy with the developments in this story. Re-visiting Grave introduced new characters as well as new information and the ending has me very eager to read book three, Shine Light.Fans of Burn Bright will love the continuation of Naif\u2019s story in Angel Arias, the mood is still dark, ominous and creepy will plenty of action to keep readers engaged and an ending that will have you keen for the final book."}, {"userName": "Stacey (Sassy Book Lovers)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3505114-stacey-sassy-book-lovers", "userReview": "I was one of the lucky few who recieved an advance copy to review from the Publishing company Random House Australia (thank you Dorothy.)
