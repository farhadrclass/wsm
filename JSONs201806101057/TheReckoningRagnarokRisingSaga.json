While I was pretty sure Roberts wouldn\u2019t actually kill off our main character I have learned that you can never be 100 percent sure. So, spoiler alert, our hero Wylie survives his suicidal bombing and resumes his quest to reunite with his family. Ragnarok Rising: The Reckoning is just as full of action, if not more so than Ragnarok Rising: The Awakening. We not only had Wyllie\u2019s return but some other old, and even new, faces among friends and enemies alike. I like that what I thought were random bad guys in The Awakening were actually part of a much larger collective of people. I also mentioned in my review of Ragnarok Rising: The Awakening that there was at least one character that I wanted dead even though they weren\u2019t in the book that much, well I got my wish\u2026 sort of\u2026 I mean couldn\u2019t we have at least tortured her just a little bit? I almost feel cheated that she got off so lightly. Yes, just being killed is getting off lightly. One of the things new that I really liked was the addition of footnotes that help explain terms or acronyms. Well at least I think they are new as I don\u2019t seem to remember them from The Awakening. That all being said, I am wondering about a couple of things\u2026 I mentioned in my review of Ragnarok Rising: The Awakening that one of the things that I liked about it is the fact that our hero, Wylie, was very human; he takes damage and feels pain and what not. Now, however, his healing ability keeps being brought up and that edges into the borders of the supernatural. The other thing that has me pondering is the one eyed old man who secretly tends to Wylie while he is being tortured. . I really don\u2019t want to say too much but it feels like we are adding more supernatural to our zombie story. I guess we will have to wait for book three to see what develops.My biggest complaint is not really a \u201ccomplaint.\u201d I stated in my review of Ragnarok Rising: The Awakening that I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to enjoy the book because of its subject matter and I was surprised at how much I did like it. Now, Ragnarok Rising: The Reckoning, everything was better. I kept getting mad because I had to put the book down because, dammit, I need sleep! \u201cJust one more page\u201d or \u201cjust to the end of the chapter\u201d is what I would tell myself and the next thing I know it\u2019s one or two in the morning and I have to be up in like 6 hours. So in summery this is an awesome read and now I have to sit and seethe till book 3 comes out\u2026 whenever that may be. Dammit! ~Capt.

Roberts has the making of a very good series here, and I do know that there is a third book being planned for release later this year.

If an author can make you laugh, cry, & scream all in the same paragraph.. you know he's good! & DA is def that & more.You will read about Grant's trip from the lake explosion that saved his family's life to where he saved his family again at the jail. They know they need a new place but aren't sure where to go when Grant's light bulb went off & he knew he had the perfect place. He was their leader whether he wanted the position or not. You must read this amazing work of art by DA Roberts! I know I can't wait for Book 3...
