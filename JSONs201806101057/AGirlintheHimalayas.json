Like Shang-ri-la? The Himalayas have for centuries been the site of fantasy about holiness and magic, and this story, too, features magic and fantasy creatures. It exists as a kind of state of purity and harmony with nature. It\u2019s also a kind of allegory about growing up amidst the possibility of impending planet catastrophe. What can we do about it?The presence of Vijaya, a young human girl, is welcomed in the sanctuary\u2014which is mainly a Buddhist enclave with mystical creatures, but some of them are worried she will bring corruption and destruction (as is happening with the planet). Some folks from the human world discover finds the sanctuary, and they want to (rapaciously) \u201cdevelop\u201d it for profit, so Vijaya must help to protect it and prove that not all humans are selfish and driven by illusion. This is a graphic novel, simply illustrated, with tan and brown washes, with cute characters, especially Vijaya (and some cute spirit creatures). I think because it has that Little Prince/Giving Tree dimension to it, it might appeal to all ages. It is pretty long, at 180 pages, so may be ideal for middle grades. Strong girl main character supported by an older, wise man who appreciates her spirit and goodness. I'll rate this 3.5 (partly lower because I am not such a huge fantasy or even allegory guy), but round up because it is a debut novel and so cute.A preview:https://www.cbr.com/a-girl-in-the-him..."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "This book just came out and I bought a copy two days ago from the bookstore here in Halifax. I wasn't sure what exactly it was about but something drew me to the cover and I figured it'd be interesting to read. It's a really beautiful story with an intelligent main character, and the illustrations are what really make it stand out. Full of magic, fantasy and carrying undertones of Spirited Away as Vijaya tries to prove to her new friends that humans aren't as destructive as the madness ensuing outside their protective world, it has good morals about not judging others or being prejudiced based on where somebody is from or which group they descended from. It's an excellent graphic novel that I'd recommend to anyone."}, {"userName": "Hailey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18593464-hailey", "userReview": "I loved the illustrations but something in the story was lacking for me.

I hope there\u2019s a continuation to this because this felt like the beginning to a much larger, longer story. I need to know what will happen to Vijaya when she eventually grows up.
