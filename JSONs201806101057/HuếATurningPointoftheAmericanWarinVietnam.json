The Battle of Hue would be the bloodiest of the Vietnam War, and a turning point not just in the conflict, but in American history. When it was over, debate concerning the war in the United States was never again about winning, only about how to leave. And never again would Americans fully trust their leaders.\u201dThe Tet Offensive took the Americans completely by surprise. The way the NVA and Viet Cong were able to move thousands of troops through Southern Vietnam and lead a coordinated attack against major South Vietnamese targets was baffling. Intelligence had alerted General William Westmoreland that there were enemy troops massing for an attack against Khe Sanh; so even when reports started filtering back to him that the Marines at Hue were in the middle of a shit storm, he just simply wouldn\u2019t believe it. It was precarious politically for Westmoreland to even admit there was a problem. As word started getting out about the assault on Hue and reporters began dispatching stories, it became apparent that, for a battle that didn\u2019t exist, it was producing way too many American body bags. Mark Bowden tells the story of Hue not only from the perspective of the American Marines and the ARVN but also from the perspective of the NVA and Viet Cong survivors. The Communists fully expected when they took the Citadel at Hue that the population would rise up and join their cause. They saw the South as subjugated people under the yoke of Saigon and the Americans. It was shocking to discover that the population of Hue was afraid of them and certainly did not see them as liberators. Well, then the executions started. Almost 5,000 Hue civilians were executed by the NVA and Viet Cong for being perceived supporters of the Americans. What a wonderful way to win friends and influence people. By the end of this battle, over 80% of this beautiful, historic city would be in ruins. The civilian population would be moving like refugees in their own city as the battle swept them from one side to the other. Neither side was very discriminate about who they shot. As the Marines experienced more and more casualties and watched their friends being zipped up in body bags, the Vietnamese, whether enemy or ally, were beginning to be seen as Gooks. \u201dThey got plumed. They were erased from the earth. One minute they were there, living and breathing and thinking and maybe swearing or even praying, just like him, and in the next second two hale young men, both of them sergeants in the US army, pride of their hometowns had been turned into a plume of fine pink mist--tiny bits of blood, bone, tissue, flesh, and brain--that rose and drifted and settled over everyone and everything nearby. It --or they-- drifted down on DiLeo, who reached up to wipe the bloody ooze from his eyes and saw that his arms and the rest of him was coated as well.\u201dThe fighting wasn\u2019t what the Marines were trained to do. As an organization, they had not fought a battle in a city since Seoul back in 1950. Colonel Ernie Cheatham dug through several footlockers that traveled with the Fifth Marines looking for any booklets that might help teach him how to fight a block by block street fight. Fortunately, he found a couple of old pamphlets that would prove helpful. The United States population was already becoming weary and distrustful of the war in Vietnam. The Battle of Hue in 1968 was the point when those for the war started to become outnumbered by those against the war. \u201dOn February 27, Walter Cronkite ended a special CBS News documentary with commentary bolstered by his own reporting at Hue: \u2018We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders, both in Vietnam and in Washington...It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.\u2019 Weeks later, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek reelection.\u201dI don\u2019t know if there has ever been a newscaster before or after who had as much influence on the American people. If you lose Cronkite, you lose America.After the bloody conclusion of Hue and the NVA and Viet Cong were stumbling back north with a fraction of the troops they sent south, there was an opportunity for the US to possibly put an end to North Vietnam incursions. The Marines who made it out of Hue were packing up, ready to head North to continue to push the advantage they had won. Politically, this was the beginning of the end of the war and this advantage, so obvious to the soldiers on the ground, was not exploited. \u201dMany of those who survived are still paying for it. To me the way they were used, particularly the way their idealism and loyalty were exploited by leaders who themselves had lost faith in the effort, is a stunning betrayal. It is a lasting American tragedy and disgrace.\u201d Maybe if the Marines had been allowed to keep rolling North after Hue, Saigon would look like Seoul or Tokyo. Those two cities benefited greatly from being allies with the Americans after the war. I hope my review has shown that this book is about more than just a battle. It is about a series of mistakes that actually led to the promise of an end to the war. The NVA and Viet Cong finding out that the South was not going to rise up to help them was demoralizing and certainly had those soldiers questioning some of the politically motivated beliefs that had been part of their doctrine. Bowden will introduce you to the soldiers who fought at Hue. He will show you what tactical decisions were being made on both sides of the conflict. He will show you the influence of politics and the impact that a decision made in Washington or Hanoi had on the men and women in the foxholes on the front line. He will show you the growing distrust of leadership that ultimately turned Vietnam into a quagmire. He left me with much to ponder. Highly Recommended!

This battle is significant because it marked the beginning of the end to the Vietnam War, although troops wouldn\u2019t leave until the spring of 1973. It was a brutal battle, maybe the worst of the war because of the street to street and the house to house fighting, and the terrible toll it took on the citizens of the city.Mark Bowden\u2019s work is impressive here. Even if you don\u2019t like books about war you can\u2019t help but acknowledge the effort. The research and attention to detail is exceptional, and he tells the tale from the perspective of both sides. One of the striking things was the extent of coverage by international journalists on the ground during the battle. These journalists brought the impact of the battle to light of the world, which in many cases was in direct conflict with the account of the American military and the US Government. The effort of these journalists to get the truth out to the world was one of the things that helped turn the tide of public opinion, especially in the United States."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cBeware of men with theories that explain everything.\u201d \u2015 Mark Bowden, Hue 1968: A Turning Point of the American War in VietnamI told my kids the other day that they were both indirect results of Vietnam. My wife's father, now dead, had a draft number of one, so enlisted so that he would have a better chance of chosing HOW he would enter the Vietnam War. He came in at the end of Vietnam and became a professional soldier and officer (green-to-gold). The Army trained him with helicopters and tanks, and he retired a decade ago as a Colonel. My own father, concerned too with the draft, enlisted in the Navy. He also made a career of the military and we met my wife's family when our families were both stationed in Izmir, Turkey in the late 80s and early 90s. I doubt very much if either of our fathers would have become officers and made careers out of the military without Vietnam. It is weird to think of the imacts of Vietnam 50 years+ after the fact. The Battle of Hu\u1ebf was fought 50 years ago in Jan/Feb of 1968 as part of the Tet Offensive. It was the biggest, bloodiest, and most pivitol single battle of the Vietnam War. Both sides claim success and both claims can probably be easily criticized. It was the turning point for the US in both our perception of the War. Bowden captures, through exensive interviews and research, the claustrophobia, filth, and horror of door-to-door combat. If anyone walks away from this with less stature, it is probably General Westmoreland who went to his grave over-estimating those NVA soldiers killed, and underestimating US casualties, and ignoring the civilians killed. One of the sharpest, deadliest quotes of the book summarizes my feelings about General Westmoreland:\u201cNever had a general so effectively willed away the facts.\u201d I have brothers who fought in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Everyday, I wish we paid closer attention to Vietnam so we would have avoided getting ourselves into another protracted war in a country most of our citizens know little about. Understanding Vietnam (and understanding what got us and kept us there) requires knowing DETAILS. Bowden helps to uncover aspects of this war I knew about, but at a granular level I appreciated. If this book did anything else, it made me start planning a trip to Vietnam. I'd love to see Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and of course -- Hu\u1ebf."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "Outstanding narrative history of perhaps the largest and costliest battle in the Vietnam War in terms of lives lost, an unusual urban battle rightly deserving of the moniker as a \u201cturning point\u201d for the notion that the war could not be won. This was the third year of President Johnson\u2019s intensive ramp up of the U.S. war commitment, and the commander of American forces there, General Westmoreland, had just completed a lot of PR pushing the concept that the end was in sight. The Tet Offensive, especially its success at Hue, put a lie to that propaganda. In this peaceful city, during Tet, it was traditional to send cups of paper with lit candles floating down the Huong like flickering blossoms, prayers for health, for success, for the memory of loved ones away or departed \u2026The ritual was Hue\u2019s emblem and signature, a gesture of beauty and calm, of harmony between the living and the dead, an expression of Vietnam\u2019s soul, a place far from the horrors of war.Not this year.Tet involved a well-planned simultaneous attack of targets in over 100 cities and towns throughout South Vietnam beginning on the Chinese New Year (Jan. 30). It was a huge risk and incurred large losses in the counterattacks marshaled in response. In nearly all other sites of Tet activity, occupation of buildings or territories were brief. However, the takeover of the large and ancient city of Hue (140,000 residents) by nearly 10,000 North Vietnam Army (AVRN) and Vietcong soldiers was to take nearly a month of desperate fighting, incurring upwards of 10,000 casualties of combatants and civilians to return it to the dominion of the corrupt government of the Republic of South Vietnam. In the process, the combined destructive power of tanks, artillery, aerial bombing, and naval bombardment turned the beautiful ancient capital and majestic cultural center on the Perfume River into rubble. The optics on this and the daily flow of American body bags were bad. Intrepid journalists were finally able to portray how many Vietnamese saw the war, as a continuation of recurrent colonial invasion by foreigners over the generations. As a result of his five years of research on the battle, Bowden brings the motives, strategies, and actions of combatants on both sides, civilians, and journalists alive in a vivid way by tapping into their journals and reports and conducting many interviews of the now aging survivors. For the military events, he usually tracks the situations of company or platoon level engagements. This is Bowden\u2019s special strength, portraying ordinary soldiers doing extraordinary feats against bad odds. Most had little conception of what the war was about. They risked their lives primarily for their own band of brothers. They were used to small-scale actions against VC guerilla action in the jungles and rice paddies, but no one up and down the line of command was expecting a house-to-house and block-by-block type of fighting against the large, well-equipped enemy they were dealing with. The Marines hadn\u2019t experienced such World War 2-type of fighting since the battle for Seoul in the Korean War. Although there were many attempts at the beginning to preserve the city\u2019s infrastructure and architecture, such restraints soon crumbled. Bowden balances such an \u201caction\u201d account with plenty of interludes with the colonels and generals calling the shots from the region and less frequent forays into the planning process in the rarefied ether of Hanoi and Washington. Mistakes were made. Lots of them. Many Marines and AVRN allies paid the price, usually related to overconfidence of commanders and underestimation to their enemy. For background, the map below shows how Hue is close to the DMZ with North Vietnam and both near the Gulf of Tonkin, communist infiltration routes through Laos, and within 20 miles of the American base at Phu Bai (and its long-range guns).In the map below, we see with red arrows the attack of the communist forces that took both the old city within the 2-mile square walls of the Citadel, containing the old imperial palace and stately residents of the well-to-do, and, across the river, the triangular \u201cNew City\u201d, containing many government facilities like the police , the prison, embassies, the university, hospital, markets, Catholic cathedrals and Buddhist shrines. Both the AVRN headquarters within the Citadel and the Marine MACV compound (Military Assistance Command, Vietnam) somehow held out in the early onslaught and served as a toehold to reinforce and strengthen in the days to come. The former were cut off until one of 11 bridges across the moats to gates through the Citadel\u2019s 26-foot high walls could be retaken. The major bridge across the river near the Citadel (and route of connection to Phu Bai) was destroyed early, along with the depot of AVRN tanks and assault vehicles. To assure a means for supply, reinforcement, and evacuation of the wounded, the Marines in the New City secured at high cost a boat launch on the river and a clear space on the river bank for helicopter landings. The blue boxes show the sites of eventual build-up of rescue forces, with U.S. forces initially concentrating on retaking the New City and AVRN with embedded U.S. troops and advisors on the Citadel. Much slaughter of Americans took place at ambush sites on their way from Phu Bai. The counterattack was slow to develop and to have an impact. Back at the ranch, Westmoreland kept painting the situation as one of suppressing a limited number of snipers and justified holding back troops due to a fantasy that the real objective was the U.S. base at Khe Sanh close to the DMZ. In the meantime, the political commissars serving the communist regime in Hanoi instituted a terrible purging and execution of Vietnamese tagged as collaborators or benefactors of Thieu\u2019s regime. Estimates range from 3,000 to 6,000 killed, dwarfing the nearly 900 killed in the fighting. The fantasy of the main architect of Tet, General Thanh, was that the bold and broad actions of the attacks would inspire the people to rise up in rebellion and complete the liberation and unification of their country. In Hue, a large fraction of the civilians were educated students, teachers, merchants, and professionals of every stripe and thus not fertile ground for such propaganda. They were more concerned with survival than with ideology.Marines at Citadel perimeter wallJohn Olson\u2019s iconic photograph of American wounded and a medic being transported from a combat site in Hue on the top of a tankCivilians flee fighting near the destroyed Truong Tien BridgeCivilian deaths were collateral damage that leaders on both sides neglected in their plans. Bowden covers the stories of several. One is of a teen-aged girl who joined the militia tasked with helping to bring in caches of supplies and weapons before the attack and guide the hiding of advance infiltration of soldiers. Another featured a poet from Saigon in Hue to visit his family on the holiday and caught up in helping them keep safe. Another tale is of a young woman who had just married an American with the diplomatic corps, a situation making her a clear target for the brutal purging. Sadly, when the communist forces were finally forced to withdraw, the civilian population was subject to a counter-purge of all those judged to have helped with the takeover, willing or not. Bowden notes that these executions (one to two thousand according to Wiki) were sanctioned by an unidentified American official.I enjoyed most of all Bowden\u2019s focus on a cadre of brave journalists and photographers who covered the battle and helped shape public perceptions of the war with its grave realities. His own mentor from his days with the New York Times, Eric Roberts, get significant air time, excelling at telling the human stories of those caught up in the battle and sustaining the miserable crowded living conditions available to them. Michael Herr, author of the wonderful memoir \u201cDispatches\u201d, is another interesting addition. Another notable figure is the French reporter, Catherine Leroy, who though only 5 foot tall and 85 pounds bravely sought out coverage of the communist forces and interviewed the civilians they took into custody. Finally, we get the story of Walter Cronkite, the trusted voice of America, slowly coming to the feeling of being betrayed by the lying of Westmoreland and coming to Hue as part of a fact-finding tour of Vietnam. His resulting documentary cast doubts upon the whole war effort and shocked Johnson enough with its undermining of public support of the war that he soon announced he would not seek re-election. Westmoreland was sacked. His defense secretary, Robert McNamara, was also soon let go after advocating cutting back on American troop levels. Despite the growing knowledge that the war could not be won, the Domino Theory still lived for Nixon, and it took another five more years for the war to reach its inevitable conclusion. For those who like me appreciated the Burns-Novick masterful PBS TV series on the war, this book is for you. It honors well those who sacrificed so much to serve while revealing the tragic outcomes and folly of the whole enterprise."}, {"userName": "'Aussie Rick'", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2413336-aussie-rick", "userReview": "I finished Mark Bowden's book; Hue 1968 and found it a very good story. It was interesting to read accounts from both sides of the fighting and the civilians trapped in the middle. The author is critical of Westmoreland for his fixation on Khe Sanh at the expense of Hue and he is also critical of the way the US military high command drip-fed its troops into the battle leading to excessive casualties. I really felt for the poor soldiers/Marines and the platoon and company commanders fighting not only very brave and resourceful NVA who were dug in and prepared for the American response, but also their own commanders who were blind to the scale of the Tet offensive in Hue. However the USMC is known for being resourceful and doing more with less. Like this account on the use of the Ontos armoured vehicle in confined street fighting in conjunction with tanks in the built-up areas of Hue:\"The Ontos was more vulnerable to enemy fire, but it was smaller, was faster, and had more firepower. Cheatham kept it behind the tanks as each day's advance began. The heavy fire directed at the tanks exposed the enemy's firing positions. Cheatham would then calmly stand on the street alongside the Ontos - with his helmet on he was almost as tall as the vehicle's top hatch - and point out targets for its six big guns. Then the vehicle would speed out in front of the tanks, use tracer rounds from its spotting rifle to zero in, and fire one or more of its guns. The vehicle would rock so far backward it looked like it might tilt over, but then it settled back and sped in reverse to safety. It was a very useful weapon. Its six big guns knocked down even thick walls completely, or blew big holes in them. In time the enemy was seen to flee as soon as the Ontos's spotting rifle was fired. Few waited for the blast to follow.\"There were numerous accounts of bravery and self sacrifice on behalf of the Marines and also harrowing accounts from the civilians trapped within the maelstrom of modern urban warfare. The author also follows some of the soldiers on both sides and some of the civilians and provides details of what happened to them after Hue and the end of the war.Overall its a good story which is easy to read and flows like a well-written novel. It is well worth the time and I doubt many will be disappointed in Mark Bowden's account of this famous battle. It offers a grunts eye view of the fighting and then if you feel like more you can go onto Eric Hammel's account which is more a standard military history. (According to the blurb at Amazon; \"Fire in the Streets spent many years on official U.S. Marine Corps professional reading lists as the best example of modern military operations in urban terrain.\")"}, {"userName": "Harold", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1962408-harold", "userReview": "This is a detailed, precise view of the Vietnam war, Tet Offensive, and specifically the battle of Hue. It is an in depth close up, focusing moment by moment on the battle, like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan. It is meticulously researched (or appears so) with mini biographies, often no more than a paragraph or two, of the soldiers in the heat of battle, and often accompanied by a vivd description of their deaths or maiming. The Book is titled a turning point, but it is not the macro story of the war. There is some description of why it is a turning point, but very little of the history of the war, how we got into it, why exactly this turned the tide, and what happened afterward. This is the micro story of who got a bullet in their head, and why. You are a witness to the brutality and futility of war. If you ever want be a soldier, or encourage your son or daughter to be a soldier, particularly if there is any chance of war (as there always seems to be) read this first, and make them read this.

Bowden relies on the same assiduous research, exemplified by his interviews with all sides of the conflict; American Marines and decision makers, North Vietnamese soldiers and commanders, in addition to civilians caught in the conflict. Bowden\u2019s fluid writing style along with his in depth knowledge of what transpired in Hue` has created the preeminent account of the 1968 Tet offensive, concentrating on the seizure of the ancient city of Hue`, and the American/ARVN (South Vietnamese) retaking of the city that came at an extremely high cost in terms of casualties and treasure.Bowden zeroes in on the major players in the war as well as the ground troops who were the main combatants and the civilians who were caught in the crosshairs of the battle. Bowden correctly excoriates General William Westmoreland, the American commander in charge of the war. Westmoreland became obsessed with kill ratios and/or body counts to measure American progress. By the end of 1967 he grew very encouraged that the war was close to an end and instead of taking into account the facts on the ground and cracks in American intelligence he continued to see battles in terms of numbers rather than the ability to maintain control of territory, and who the Vietnamese civilians actually supported. Westmoreland was convinced that an attack was in the offering, but that it would come at Khe Sanh, and was caught completely by surprise at the strength of the offensive and the fact that Hue` had fallen to the enemy. At the outset he had shifted US forces around depleting certain areas, thus facilitating the success of Tet. Westmoreland suffered from the same tunnel vision that most American commanders and politicians, in that they equated indigenous nationalism with communism throughout the Cold War, resulting in the war in Southeast Asia. Personal stories abound be it Che The Mung; an eighteen year old girl whose sister was killed and father imprisoned by the ARVN who became a member of the Viet Cong at age twelve. Her role was to help prepare for a general uprising in Hue once the offensive began and lead soldiers into the city which she knew like the back of her hand. We become familiar with a number of American commanders and lesser officers in addition to the \u201cgrunts.\u201d Their personal stories are told and many stick out like Lt. Andrew Westin who enlisted after being married eleven months and found that his efforts to avoid Vietnam were dashed when he was ordered to join the 7th Cavalry. Bowden makes good use of the daily letters he sent to his wife Mimi back in Ypsilanti, MI and they afford the reader a clear vision of what it was like for American troops. Richard \u201cLefty\u201d Leflar, an eighteen year old who grew up outside Philadelphia who had difficulties staying out of the courts, joined the Marines and was dropped into the battle to retake Hue` in mid-February 1968. We witness the carnage and the brutality of the battle to retake Hue` through Leflar\u2019s perspective and it is not pretty. Commanders like Colonel Dick Sweet and Lt. Col. \u201cBig\u201d Ernie Cheatham who helped command \u201con the ground\u201d the US effort to retake Hue will find their stories told in depth, as are reporters like New York Times Saigon bureau chief Gene Roberts whose writings were the first to educate the American people with what was actually happening in Hue. CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite visits the battlefield during the Tet Offensive and after learning the truth of what was occurring on the ground changes his view of the war \u2013 with the most trusted man in America reporting events President Johnson was shaken.Bowden has done a masterful job in recreating the North Vietnamese preparation and assault on Hue`. The reader is provided an excellent assortment of maps to follow and understand troop movements. His narrative is enhanced as he tells the story, in part, through the eyes of Nguyen Van Quang Ha and his team who lived in a hole with a thatched cover that made them invisible to US air assets. As Hue` became the one place in South Vietnam that most directly contradicted Westmoreland\u2019s assurances, President Lyndon B. Johnson began to question his commander\u2019s conclusions. Clark Clifford\u2019s description in his memoir COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT aptly describes Westmoreland\u2019s request for 206,000 more troops in February 1968 and Johnson\u2019s reaction that led to his withdrawal from his presidential reelection campaign at the end of March. As a result Westmoreland would finally be fired by the president. Bowden recreates American preparations to retake Hue` very carefully. His analysis is based on interviews with the participants from both sides. The difficulty in retaking the city was captured by the phrase, \u201clearning by trial and tragically bloody error\u2026..[as] they all grew accustomed to the smell of death,\u201d civilians, enemy soldiers, and fellow Marines alike. After reading Bowden\u2019s account of the urban warfare in Hue one wonders about events in Mosul, Iraq today as American forces were not well trained or equipped for street to street warfare. American Marines had not confronted this type of \u201croom to room, hand to hand\u201d combat since Seoul in 1950. In fact Bowden is quite correct in stating that the American command was caught completely flatfooted as they believed that such \u201c a swift and cunning coup was unimaginable.\u201d When confronted with the enormity of Tet, and how severely they underestimated what they were up against as they tried to retake the city with many Marines being sacrificed. Bowden stresses the ignorance of American commanders who gave many orders without any real knowledge of the actual situation in Hue` No matter the carnage to US troops many commanders, especially Westmoreland \u201cseemed almost oblivious to the largest single battle of the Tet Offensive, if not of the entire war, underway in Hue`.\u201dWhat the Tet Offensive showed was the ability of the enemy to prepare a clandestine attack that was a remarkable feat of planning and coordination, and that the enemy could reach any part of the country it wished, but in the end the invaders made no lasting gains. What they accomplished was providing fodder for the anti-war movement in the United States, creation of doubt in many Americans and their politicians as they achieved a psychological victory, not a military one as the expected \u201crise of South Vietnamese civilians\u201d against the Diem regime never occurred.Bowden also explores the uglier aspects of war. American atrocities are described as is the racism that existed by both sides. Substance abuse is also discussed as for many soldiers it would have been difficult to survive without using drugs. One of the most haunting aspects that Bowden addresses is the issue of grief, something that there was not time for in Hue. Death hovered over each combatant and was a daily occurrence, and when one soldier went down, their compatriots did not have the time to deal with it properly \u2013 a price that would be paid on the battlefield, and if they were lucky enough to survive, when they returned home.If there is one major criticism of Bowden\u2019s work it is that the author is determined to include almost every experience the combatants were involved in. The result is that at times the flow of the narrative becomes somewhat disjointed. However, this should not detract from the overall quality of his work as he has produced a prodigious account of what occurred in Hue`, particularly in the context of the overall war itself. Bowden has produced the most complete account of Tet and the Battle for Hue` that has been written and his approach should satisfy historians and the general reader alike."}, {"userName": "Steve Sarner", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216-steve-sarner", "userReview": "\u201cPockets of resistance\u201d were actually bundles of lies.Hue 1968 is a complicated, tragic and phenomenal story \u2013 extraordinarily well told.Mark Bowden has out done himself on researching a terrible time during a terrible and, in hindsight from many perspectives, senseless battle in a senseless war.

Hue 1968, doesn't stray too far from Homer's ancient conclusions.Mark Bowden has taken huge strides as a writer since his excellent Black Hawk Down. I think Vietnam gave him a much larger canvas, even in a book focused on one battle, and he takes us into LBJ's White House, the halls of Congress, the Pentagon, the command HQ's and bunkers, and most importantly, and effectively, the ever changing front line of urban, close-quarter combat. So close it comes down to hand-to-hand.The battle for Hue took place during the Tet offensive. Tet, the Vietnamese New Year, was traditionally a time of unofficial cease-fire. Not in 1968. In a mind-boggling, almost superhuman feat of logistics, tactics, and secrecy the Viet Cong launched simultaneous attacks organized to the nth degree, and 80,000 troops assaulted 100 cities. Hue, and ancient and beautiful show case city, was the one city the Viet Cong captured and held for any length of time. They knew they wouldn't keep it, but they also knew the Americans and ARVN forces would be forced to shed a lot of blood in order to take it back. The VC held on for a month, and casualties, albeit inflated by both sides, were high on both sides. Civilian deaths were compounded as the VC political teams used the opportunity to cleanse the population of suspected collaborators. In that respect, mass graves were the order of the day.The battle for Hue was like most others. The top brass had no idea, but plenty of opinions that caused them to disregard their field commanders, demand the ridiculous and impossible, and deflect blame and responsibility when things went wrong. Gen Westmoreland, (read: Waste More Land, which is what us anti-war types called him,) was the commander of all US forces in North Vietnam, and at least in that role, an incompetent. His command decisions focused on preparing for a battle that had yet to happen, rather than fighting the battle at hand. He made the fighting more miserable than necessary in Hue by keeping troops and material in Khe Sanh in the belief that would be the next big battle of the war. That battle never happened. Westmoreland is also the guy who came up with body counts as the best measure of who was winning. That was also a way for him to polish his own brass. We killed more VC than they killed us, or ARVN troops, but it didn't matter. The VC never had to win, they only had to not lose. Oh, Westy also gave us the \"light at the end of the tunnel,\" quote - too bad it was a fully armored train.Oh, every once in a while a big shot Colonel would helicopter in, and try to take charge, but for the most part the fighting and dying was done by Captains, Lieutenants, non-coms, and grunts, and those are the stories Mr. Bowden gives us. Death in war is arbitrary. Your buddy could be lighting a cigarette one second, left faceless by a well aimed round the next - even while handing you his lighter. We get as close to that as good prose can get us, and we feel a shock every time somebody goes. Mr. Bowden is as good as Homer in showing us what wounds and death are like. He's better than Homer, or most others, in taking us into the hearts and minds of US and VC forces alike by choosing a few whose back-stories he relates even while following them through the fight. That's why we're shocked as events unfold in personal and human ways.Combined forces of the US Army, Marines, and ARVN successfully recaptured Hue, or at least recaptured the rubble that was Hue, and the war raged on. \"Westy,\" that Hollywood good looking General is reassigned, but sticks to his story of high command success and brilliant strategies until the day he dies a peaceful death.This is a helluva good book. My review can't come close to telling you how good. I suggest you find out for yourself."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/646347-chris", "userReview": "A riveting account of the battle that changed American perceptions of the Vietnam War.

I listened to this book in the Audible format while following along with the e-book. I have read a lot of books about Vietnam since in some ways that is my war, The war I avoided by becoming a father in college and thus exempt. I have never read anything about Hue and wondered how I had missed this book. It turns out it has just been published.Every book I have read about Vietnam led me to believe that it was totally a war fought in the jungle. But this battle was fought in the second largest city in Vietnam and was truly urban warfare. It was seized and held by the North Vietnamese for nearly a month. It was regained by the Americans after an intense battle that was waged as urban warfare often is Block by block and building by building.The stories are as personal and as bloody as any you will read about Vietnam. It is a story about the nearly total destruction of a historic city as well as the author insists the belief of the American people in the war. The US government and the military basically lied to the US about what was happening in Hue for 25 days. The news media in the city gradually exposed the truth.This is a long but very readable book. It includes many eyewitness accounts of people who were there on both sides of the battle. Well I would definitely classify this as an antiwar book, it does give some very credible glimpses about how the people doing the fighting got into that situation. But it is hard to understand even in retrospect how the war went on so long.I would not claim much ability in evaluating and reviewing Audible books but since the majority of books I am reading these days are in the audible format, I should try to improve my skills. I think this book is very well done by a single reader. Lyndon Johnson appears occasionally and his quotes do have his recognizable southern twang.

If you were following the war then, you would know that the official word from the American government is that we were doing well, degrading Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) ability to mount significant actions.What sets this book apart is its \"human perspective\" on the battle at Hue, the great success of the Viet Cong-NVA-local volunteers rising in cities across South Viet Nam. Then uprising in most other places was squelched rather quickly. The story here is told through the words of people on both sides of the combat, providing interesting contrasts in point of view.One sad commentary is that the American forces were unable to comprehend the number of NVA-Viet Cong-local participants (relatively small in number) and sent too few reinforcements. They literally could not believe the power of the opposing forces. This led to unnecessary casualties as American troops fought against superior numbers and got bloodied on many occasions.The story told in this volume is the drudgery and hellishness for all involved in he close order combat in a city slowly being destroyed by bombs, mortars, artillery. . . . Civilians dies in large numbers as did combatants. The reader gets s sense of some of the combatants--and their death leaves one with a sense of loss.A powerful book.

The author stresses the significance of the city of Hue with a geographical location midway between Saigon in South Vietnam and Hanoi in North Vietnam that made it a natural site for a prominent tug of war battle. He seemed to portray the U.S. Army and Marine boots on the ground favorably, whereas the reporters seem to be a mixed bag and General Westmoreland along with Commander-in-Chief Lyndon Johnson do not fare as well. Wars are very brutal and ugly and at times I had to hold back from being drawn to close to the subject. Today Vietnam is a curious tourist destination for many American\u2019s.

This comprehensive book tells the story of this battle for each side in a detailed and readable approach.

The latter provided consistent false reports about this battle, sending small groups in to \"clean up pockets\", when in fact the forces of the north held the city in strength. It is also likely that less lives would have been lost, and extremely possible that less negative reaction would have followed stateside.In a reaction vote, 1968 saw the election of Richard Nixon, who stated he had a secret plan for winning the war. I must compare to a similar recent reaction vote and secret plans, as history repeats itself - to my great disappointment.Mark Bowden is also the author of Black Hawk Down, which received much acclaim.

Bowden employs the multifaceted immediacy of his other works to brilliant effect, alternating between the NVA and Vietcong soldiers assaulting the city, the ARVN soldiers (some courageous, others less so) defending it, the American Marines who painstakingly retook the city over the course of a month's savage fighting - not to mention the reporters observing it, civilians caught in the crossfire and incredulous audiences watching in the US and abroad. A wealth of interviews and gut-wrenching accounts of street fighting and atrocities (especially the Communists massacring at least 2,800 civilians, depicted in gruesome detail) brings the battle home in the tradition of classic narrative history. It's a testament to how far Vietnam historiography has come that Bowden, rather than lapsing into polemic or revisionism, achieves something like balance; he's able to square the courage of the Marines and the Communists' tactical failure with the simple fact that Tet, and Hue, were emblematic of a war that American policymakers misunderstood from the beginning, and never failed to prosecute incorrectly - at great cost to their own men and the Vietnamese they were ostensibly protecting. A brilliant work that's a must-read for any Vietnam buffs."}, {"userName": "Francis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3440020-francis", "userReview": "Now that I have finished the book I will express my final opinions concerning the book. Initially I wrote that it appeared that Mr. Bowden is a commie lover but that I would give the book a chance. Here is what I think. We have Hanoi Jane, now we have Hanoi Mark. He expresses sympathy throughout the book for atheistic communists and gives the impression that they basically were nice patriotic people. Many of the Americans and South Vietnamese on the other hand were corrupt blood thirsty killers. Mr. Bowden expesses all of this not in so much of a straightforward manner but the insinuations are throughout the entire book with few exceptions.Whose fault are the deaths of so many civilians and the destruction of so much property? Why, it is the fault of the South Vietnamese and the US according to Mr. Bowden. Who were we to think we had a right to fight back against an aggressor? The communists INVADED the city of Hue. The South Vietnamese and the US simply repulsed that invasion. When that happens innocent people get killed, property gets destroyed. Evidently Mr. Bowden's knowledge of war is limited to Mogadishu (I liked that book) and this one. He is shocked that some US soldiers, perhaps many, called the Vietnamese, north and south, gooks. Has he ever heard the terms Japs or Krauts? That happens in war. The difference in Vietnam was that one did not know friend from foe so human nature tends to generalize especially when one's life is at stake.He is horrified at the destruction of property. Again, evidently he hasn't looked into World War II. War isn't won by playing patty cake. As he himself states the US held off in using artillery and airpower, but once they realized that the communists were not going to be dislodged without causing very high American casualties by attacking with small arms fire, larger more destructive weapons were used.Mr. Bowden had the habit of depicting communists as sympathetic characters, like the nice teenage girl who noted down the addresses of South Vietnamese officials who later were targeted for assassinations along with their entire families. Nice girl. There is also the poet. Another sympathetic character.Many including it seems Mr. Bowden have lost the notion that communism is an intrinsically evil officially atheistic, totalitarian system of official brutality and enslavement. There is no doubt that the US and South Vietnam made mistakes in that battle. Guess what? That is the nature of war because human beings are not perfect. Because mistakes were made on our part does not justify the invasion of Hue and the mass executions of so many.Mr. Bowden does acknowledge that the assassinations and executions did take place. How could he not, it has been overwhelmingly documented. For me he doesn't have much credibility as an historian as far as this book is concerned, however were he to deny that he would lose all credibility. While he mentions the executions of course he has to bring in and insinuate that the US and ARVN were at least if not more responsible for so many civilian deaths.I recently watched an interview of two Vietnam veterans who were asked about US atrocities in Vietnam. They acknowledged they did occur, however when the perpetrators were caught they were punished and, such crimes were in opposition to US and Army policy. The communists on the other hand practiced mass executions and genocidal acts as part of official government policy.One small cookie that Mr. Bowden throws out that even he had to acknowledge is, none of those who engaged in the mass assassinations executions were ever held to account.One of the I believe reporters(?) mentioned in the book was troubled that a wounded NVA soldier was asking American soldiers for help and to his horror not only did they just walk by, they said insulting things to the POOR man. Guess what, he was the enemy who may have just a few minutes earlier tried and maybe even succeeded in killing Americans. I hate to break this, but in war American lives come first. Maybe he was eventually taken care of. That is not noted. If we was taken care of it would have been much better than the Hanoi Hilton. Mr. Bowden accepts as a given that the entire South Vietnamese government was corrupt. I'm sure some were. I don't know what planet Mr. Bowden lives on but in every country there are corrupt government officials. That doesn't change the righteousness of the cause, namely freedom, something we obviously take for granted these days. I was tempted on multiple times to just stop reading the book because of the pro-commie slant, however I did decide to finish the book as painful as it was. The only parts of the book that interested me were the day to day accounts of action during the battle. The Vietnam war was lost by weak kneed politicians. If you decide to go to war, you have to go all the way, half measures do not work in war, the enemy only takes that as half hearted interest in the war. Had we fought WWI that way that we fought in Vietnam we would have lost that war. Iraq was another haflhearted war, not at first, but our politicians succeeded in losing the peace that our military had won.The fall of South Vietnam lead to the fall of Laos and Cambodia. Mr. Bowden I'm sure would find some way to blame the US for the genocide of millions that took place. Those countries fell because we weren't there to protect them.I don't recommend this book unless you are able to see through the lefty propaganda and are interested into day to day accounts of the battle."}, {"userName": "Marks54", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54", "userReview": "This is a very good book. I had heard a lot about it but had yet to plunge in because the Vietnam war has not been high on my priority list recently. Then I watched the Burns/Novick documentary on the war (which I highly recommend) and thought that the new Bowden book would be a good follow-up.Let me start with the elephant in the room - the politics of the war and of revisionist history. I remember the Vietnam war and how contentious it was - and remains. It was from working through some of the memoirs from that era that I first realized the difficulties of trusting memoir accounts of contentious conflicts, however well intentioned. In the fifty years since the battle of Hue, there has been time for great lessons to have been learned from Vietnam by the military as well as for lessons once learned to have been unlearned (for example on counterinsurgency warfare). I appreciate the developing perspective on the war that has come with time and reflection. This is reflected in Bowden\u2019s book on Hue. I think the historians and journalists are doing their work well. That some may disagree with more recent perspectives on the war is just fine with me. It is the criticism and discussion that adds value rather than the pointed repetition of well worn perspectives.Now about the book. The hook here for me is how Bowden takes a deep dive into this remarkable battle and then uses what he finds to reexamine the context and broader narratives of the war following the Tet Offensive. Accounts of war far too often tend to hang out around one level of analysis or another. This puts a conceptual strain on a reader seeking to understand how the war could look one way on the ground and a quite different way from headquarters. This is an extremely valuable perspective that is used to good purpose in this book.Bowden\u2019s book is also valuable as part of another literature of sorts that shows how the tactical details of a battle and its immediate outcomes may prove highly divergent from the influence of the battle on a broader theatre of war or political context. This is the literature of winning battles but losing wars. He excelled at this in his earlier book \u201cBlackhawk Down\u201d and is very effective at telling a similar story about the Tet Offensive and Hue. Reality is nuanced, of course, and calling a winner or loser from the battle of Hue at a tactical level is challenging. The broader effects of the battle on the American war effort were very clear.The book reads well, although it is a bit long. There are lots of pictures - many quite powerful. There is always a tension in how the various accounts that are woven together actually fit and are interpreted. That is a problem for any journalistic account and readers need to be critical. I did not see many problems, however, and thought Bowden to be very effective.Overall, I really enjoyed the book."}, {"userName": "Brent", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1297492-brent", "userReview": "This fresh history is so moving: a deeply researched and confidently written telling of the messiest of urban battles of the Vietnam Tet Offensive.Highest recommendation."}, {"userName": "Michael Burnam-Fink", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink", "userReview": "It's almost exactly 50 years from the Tet Offensive, one of the most decisive and misunderstood campaigns in history. Tet was based on delusion on both sides. The Communist leadership believed that the people of South Vietnam were primed to join a general offensive and overthrow the puppet government. General Westmoreland and MACV were sure that the Communists were on the ropes, and that the key battle was at the remote firebase of Khe Sanh. On the Vietnamese New Year, Jan 30 1968, VC units backed by NVA regulars launched attacks across South Vietnam, showing that the Communists were capable of massive organized operations with exceptional operational security. Most of these assaults were repelled, but the city of Hue fell to the Communist, with small pockets of resistance around the MACV compound in the south of the city, and the ARVN headquarters in the northern parts of the 19th century citadel.What followed could only be described as a fiasco on the American side. Marine companies were fed into the city piecemeal, and told to expect only light resistance. What they found were Communists fighters dug in, with ample supplies and reinforcements, willing to contest every block and building. Bad weather and restrictive rules of engagement prevent the Marines from using their artillery and air support at first, though by the end of the battle shells were falling freely, wrecking 80% of the city. The Marines hadn't done any urban combat since Seoul in 1950, but they relearned fast. M48 Patton tanks become mobile bunkers. The Ontos tank destroyer, armed with six 106mm recoilless rifles, would scoot out, demolish a building with a salvo, an retreat. Marines learned to 'walk through walls', avoiding doors and intersections by blasting holes in the buildings. Over 24 grueling days, they forced the Communist forces to retreat.Both sides claimed victory, but the surest losers were the civilians of Hue. The Communists wasted no time setting up revolutionary tribunals and executing \"enemies of the people\". The Americans and South Vietnamese had no formal policies of execution, but their lavish use of firepower did not discriminate between fighting positions and refugees sheltering in bunkers. Suspicious GIs shot first and asked questions never, gunning down people searching for food or trying to cross the lines. Thousands of civilians were murdered by their supposed \"liberators\". Westmoreland's reputation, tarnished by Tet, was done in by the Battle of Hue and the Siege of Khe Sanh.Bowden is a talented author, and he makes the action come alive again, putting you there with the Marines and the Vietnamese.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in the war. Opening quote: \"Wisdom comes to us when it can no longer do any good.\"--Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. From the introduction: \"Hours before daylight on January 31, 1968, the first day of Tet, the Lunar New Year, nearly 10,000 NVA and VC troops descended from hidden camps in the Central Highlands and overran the city of Hue, the historical capital of Vietnam. They took all of Hue except for two embattled compounds: an ARVN base in the north and a small post for American military advisors in the south. Both had no more than a few hundred men and were in danger of being overrun. It would take 24 days of terrible fighting to take the city back. It would be the bloodiest battle of the war. From then on, talk was never again about winning but about how to leave. And never again would Americans fully trust their leaders.\" The Huong River through Hue was known as the Perfume River. The communist party by definition is the will of the people, so no one can disagree with it. Some western young people foolishly never understood that. And it was First Secretary Le Duan, not Ho Chi Minh, who controlled the Tet Offensive. They really believed the Vietnamese people would fall in line. Ho was more willing to be patient. The Tet campaign may have been more of a nod to the Soviet Union than to Mao's China. Le Duan really expected a \"decisive victory.\" Basically, they risked everything \"on one roll of the dice.\" President Thieu's violent repression of Buddhists led many over to the communists. That included the poet Nguyen Dac Xuan, a follower of the Hue monk Thich Nhat Hanh, a peace activist who fled to the US. The irony of Buddhist thought is that under communism, they are completely controlled. Foolishly, Americans were more focused on Khe Sanh than on the cities. That left Hue mainly unprotected for such an enormous attack. One of the few ARVN commanders fully respected by the American military was General Truong. Unfortunately, many of the other commanders were chosen for political reasons. And speaking of bad generals, there is nothing positive to say about William Westmoreland. At Phu Bai, the American commanders could not understand what was wrong in Hue. It took them way too long to understand the size of the attack. They could not get why the few marines \"could not flatten anything between them and the fucking Citadel and rescue poor general Truong.\" Enemy soldiers shouted in English at some marines, \"Fuck you, marines!\" So Sergeant Gonzalez told a marine who spoke Vietnamese to shout something back. He shouted in English, \"Fuck you, NVA!\" Gonzalez said, \"Good.\" It took one day for Hue to fall. It took a hell of lot longer for the American chain of command to get it. Many gains were quickly reversed in many cities. But it would be several days of fighting in Kon Tum, Buan Ma Thuot, Phon Thiet, Can Tho, and Ben Tre. In Saigon, it was the significance of the targets that made an impact: the HQ for the army and navy, the Independence Palace, the US Embassy, and the national radio station. Westmoreland wrote, \"The enemy has [about five hundred men] in the Hue Citadel.\" He was off by a factor of twenty. The \"liberators\" promised a large textile plant with jobs for the citizens. Sounds like Donald Trump. Several foreigners were executed, including doctors and missionaries. The orders given to the soldiers were impossible to do. But they were orders, and the squad leaders tried to follow them. Young men do what they are told in combat. And the orders came \"from above\" by people who didn't get what was happening. I can remember being told to guard the school where I worked when it was my turn. The sergeant said to get my gun and let him know if anything happens. I thought, \"If anything happens, I'm going to be fucking dead.\" As the dead and wounded were sent down to Phu Bai headquarters, men were told to \"meet personally with the Task Force X-Ray command staff and tell them in the bluntest terms possible what the hell was going on in Hue.\" The famous Saigon photograph of South Vietnam's national police chief Nguyen Ngoc Loan shooting a handcuffed VC prisoner in the head and showing the moment of impact was just out. What was not shown was how this prisoner had spent the morning slaughtering the families of South Vietnamese soldiers in cold blood. The photographer always regretted the picture. Loan forgave him and shook it off. He would eventually be shot and lose a leg. Here is a link to his story: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1... Many of the soldiers fighting in Hue had never been trained in city fighting. The last big urban battle was in Seoul in 1950, a grinding fight that lasted almost a month and killed more than 450 marines. They had to learn a crash course. For example, stay off the streets. And make your own doors through walls, which can be both an enemy and a friend. And flatten a building with an enemy combatant in it. Before I was sent to Saigon, I was trained in jungle warfare by someone who had no clue about what could happen in a city. Soldiers in tanks, urinated and defecated into their helmets. Then they opened the hatch under the seat on the driver's side and dumped it out. The interior stunk, but it was the safest place to be. Once a soldier's foot was accidentally run over. A soldier named Anderegg had a serious neck wound. He was morphined up. When a chopper was not able to airlift him out, he ripped off the tag a doctor gave him and said, \"Fuck this,\" and went back to his tank. Compounds under siege had no way to flush overworked toilets. Some stalls had mounds of shit five and six feet high since soldiers climbed to the top to defecate. Don't expect that scene to appear in the movie version. Some non-combatant soldiers from the Armed Forces Network radio and tv stations were held prisoners of war for five years. One soldier describes how an explosion in the next foxhole over vaporized the men in it and sent a plume of fine pink mist over everything. He had to wipe it out of his eyes and saw it all over his clothes. That same soldier had the top of his head shot. When he came to, a sergeant showed no sympathy and told him to \"Keep the integrity of the perimeter!\" One major mistake on the part of the North was the decision to hold on to Hue. There was no way to keep it permanently, so the result was the destruction of the city and the civilians in it. The Front rousted \"known enemies of the people\" from their homes for retribution. Orders called for \"a wave of assassinations of enemy thugs, spies, and secret police in the area.\" A 22-page, single-spaced list was made of who to kill. Once the purges started, they picked up speed. Blood lust grows. Arguments occurred about hanging flags. When a compound was taken over, marines wanted an American flag. That went against orders, so it had to be taken down and replaced with a South Vietnamese flag. I read that after the fall of Saigon in 1975, the VC were very unhappy that a North Vietnamese flag was used instead of the VC flag. One chaplain asked God to \"bless those who were going to die.\" The Captain nearly threw something at him. He told someone to keep the chaplain the hell away from his men. The elite South Vietnamese unit Hac Bao, known as the Black Panthers, was down to a few men. Their marine adviser was Jim Coolican. Their was no way any ARVN force could take back the fortress without American help. There seemed to be very little concern for the masses of civilians trapped by the fighting. The main concerns were about the historical treasures. Even today, I have heard people talk about what a shame it was to destroy some buildings. Trinh Cong Son was a young Vietnamese folksinger, poet, painter, and composer known as the \"Vietnamese Bob Dylan.\"Chris Jenkins was an international aid worker hiding in a house. A marine knocked on the door and shouted: \"Are there any VC in there?\" Jenkins identified himself. The marine: \"You're lucky we didn't throw a grenade in the window before asking questions.\" A captain later asks Jenkins in disbelief: \"Did a marine really ask that question?\" Jenkins nodded. The captain: \"It's a great war.\" Front snipers were deadly accurate. Guys would be sitting on the floor not realizing the tops of their heads were visible through the window. The next second the tops of their heads were gone. One marine was hit in the head and toppled out a second window but got his foot caught on something. His body hung upside down while the contents of his skull emptied. I hate napalm. Here is one main reason why it was used. Bombs left piles of rubble for the enemy to crawl in. With napalm, the flames sucked all of the oxygen out of underground bunkers, suffocating anyone inside, while incinerating everything above that wasn't made of stone. Dogs were shot by reflex. Once you saw one rooting into a dead body, it became second nature. Whenever the soldiers moved a few blocks, behind the firing lines were children peddling beer in 16-ounce bottles. Isn't that amazing? People survived in holes. One family of ten lived in a hole for 2 or 3 days. General Westmoreland at no point acknowledged that Hue had fallen into enemy hands. He persistently downplayed the battles.The brunt of the battle was borne by civilians. The death toll is estimated at around 5,800, which is almost certainly too low. More than 80% of the city's structures were destroyed. The Front's purges killed somewhere between 300 (the NLF's number) to 4,856 (the ARVN's number). The truth may be closer to 3,000. There were also probably executions by the Saigon regime after the battle. 250 American marines and soldiers were killed and 1,554 wounded. 458 ARVN soldiers were killed and 2,700 wounded. The NLF lost between 2,400 and 5,000. The total comes to well over 10,000 for all killed: the bloodiest battle of the Vietnam war. Walter Cronkite famously ended a newscast with a speech. The final words were, \". . . But it is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then would be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to there pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could. This is Walter Cronkite. Good night.\" Westmoreland was relieved of his command. The move was a promotion, but it was really a rebuke. A month after the battle ended, Johnson announced he would not seek reelection. The iconic photograph of the battle of Hue is the man (or men) on the tank. Here it is with an excerpt from the book.

During the period 1965 to late-1967, the Johnson Administration and the military had said that the U.S. was gradually winning the war. By the beginning of 1968, assessments from General Westmoreland were so positive that he assured Congress and the public that victory was in sight, (an observation that was contradicted by most members of the U.S. and foreign press; there was similar debate inside the administration, CIA and military as well.) The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong decided on a series of dramatic attacks on South Vietnamese cities and bases during the Tet (Lunar New Year) holiday. Many months in the planning, the North Vietnamese told their soldiers that this would be the \"knock out blow\" that stirred a rebellion by South Vietnam's citizenry against its corrupt, dictatorial and American-supported government. On January 31st, 1968, the Viet Cong and NVA struck in over 30 South Vietnamese cities, including the ancient capital of Vietnam, Hue, which up to then had been relatively untouched during the war. As the attacks intensified, U.S. command downplayed their severity, straining the credibility gap to the breaking point.Hue was easily taken by the NVA and held for several days. Bowden does a very thorough blow by blow of the two weeks of the battle, using the personal reminisces and official reports of U.S. Marines, soldiers on both sides, and civilians. Despite General Westmoreland's assessment that the fighting in Hue was \"minimal\" and a feint designed to draw our attention to the real coming attack against the firebase at Khe Sanh, there were several thousand NVA and Viet Cong in Hue. The fighting left the city mostly destroyed and 300 Marines and 2,000 ARVN troops were killed, as well as several thousand civilians caught in the middle and several thousand NVA and VC. In the end, the disconnect between Westmoreland's alternative version of events and the reality people were seeing, (Walter Cronkite showed up at one point with CBS) led the Johnson Administration to begin attempting to extricate U.S. combat forces from the conflict, (which wouldn't take place until 1973.) After the street fighting in Hue, never again did officialdom talk of \"winning\" the Vietnam War, but only how we could gradually withdraw.

The publication of this book coincided with the latest Ken Burns documentary, The Vietnam War, so I thought it would compliment the series-and it did. This book is more nuanced than the 12 hour 10 part documentary and like that film included interviews with people fighting on both sides and a people in an array of roles from civilians to soldiers. Bowden's lively writing and strong narrative made the war come alive off the pages much like he brought other subject to life in other books, such as the hunt for Pablo Escobar in Killing Pablo. The book is divided into six parts and an epilogue: 1. The Infiltration, 2. The Fall of Hue, 3. Futility and Denial, 4. Counterattack in the Triangle and Disaster at La Chu, 5. Sweeping the Triangle, and 6. Taking Back the Citadel.

The first history I learned about the Vietnam War was from watching the move \u201cRambo,\u201d in 1985. Around the same time, and viewable on VHS (what\u2019s that, Daddy?) if you missed it in the theater, were movies like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d the later set during the battle that is the focus of this book. From these movies, naturally, I learned little real history, and haven\u2019t learned much more about Vietnam since. In fact, when I was a young lawyer at a giant law firm, I used to amuse myself by needling the senior partners, rich, aging hippies all, by telling them that I thought of World War I and the Vietnam War as roughly contemporaneous, and equally relevant to the modern age\u2014that is, not at all. They were not amused.I had, and have, no real opinion about the necessity, sense, strategic conduct or winnability of the war. But before there was Rambo, there was \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d in 1982. And it\u2019s that movie, with its focus on the unperson status of returned Vietnam veterans, treated with contempt as killers in an evil war, that really has the most relevance to this book. That\u2019s because \u201cHue 1968\u201d is a maddening combination of excellent you-are-there battle history (the genre Bowden is known for) and lazy, sleazy moral equivalence. This is a book that reaches desperately to minimize the crimes of the Communists, maximize the perceived negligence of Americans and non-Communist Vietnamese, since it can find no crimes by them, and then conflate crimes with negligence. And all of it is shot through, and topped off, with childlike, slobbering adulation for the American media types whose propaganda created the hatred of veterans that made \u201cFirst Blood\u201d a believable movie.The core of the book is battle history, of course. Bowden goes through the month-long battle day-by-day, beginning with the North Vietnamese buildup, successfully concealed from the Americans. Some of his interlocutors are soldiers who fought for the Communists, which is very interesting\u2014as one would expect, to a man (or woman) they held completely delusional beliefs about their cause, including that all the citizens of Hue, and South Vietnam, would rise up and throw off the oppressors\u2019 yoke during the Tet Offensive. Bowden does a good job focusing on several individual American and ARVN (South Vietnamese) soldiers, drawing (as is his forte) sharp, interesting portraits of each of them, and working them into the overall battle narrative. This is all worth reading\u2014though, after a while, each story feels the same, which is not helped by the cast of characters being immense and constantly changing. (An oddity of this book is it has extremely few footnotes, and most are explanations, not citations. And it has no index at all, something I have never seen in a major non-fiction work and which would have helped the reader trying to drill down into the six-hundred page narrative. It does have excellent maps, though.)Forming the backdrop of the battle accounts are endless identical criticisms of William Westmoreland, for his obsessive focus on a presumed coming attack on the huge American base at Khe Sanh, while grossly downplaying and almost ignoring the ongoing vicious struggle for control of Hue. Westmoreland was doubtless someone who deserved a lot of criticism, but a little freshness or variation in the criticism now and then might be nice; the repetition comes across as obsessional. This is not helped by Bowden insisting on always calling him \u201cWesty,\u201d for some reason, like they\u2019re old pals. It\u2019s jarring\u2014Bowden also insists on never capitalizing \u201cMarines,\u201d again a jarring, unexplained choice.The only other relevant history is provided by a short Epilogue, where the end of the war is described as \u201cIn January 1973, President Thieu reluctantly signed his name to a peace agreement in Paris that ended America\u2019s direct involvement in the war, although it continued to support his regime as the fighting dragged on for two more years. Eventually the weight of Vietnamization became too much for the Saigon government to bear . . . . Under President Gerald Ford, the United States continued to provide substantial assistance to Thieu\u2019s government, but its military was no match for Hanoi\u2019s. An offensive launched in 1975 quickly routed the ARVN.\u201d Missing is any reference to Congress cutting off funds to South Vietnam after Watergate, the massive supply of Hanoi by the Soviet Union, and so on. As I say, this is not an area of expertise for me, but it\u2019s pretty obvious this is a whitewash that relieves America and the Democratic Congress of all responsibility. No information is provided about the brutal aftermath of Communist victory, other than skipping to today and noting \u201cit is extraordinary how little resentment is shown toward Americans,\u201d as though all Vietnamese were happy about the outcome of the war.Bowden never inserts his own thoughts directly. We are, for example, never told what he himself thought of the war\u2014given that he was born in 1951, he was about the same age as most of the men dying in Hue, yet that obvious reflection appears nowhere in the book. Nor are we told how he avoided being conscripted himself\u2014presumably, he was in college, and was therefore deferred (a practice I simply have never understood). Yet we are given many details about him personally, as those relate to one topic only\u2014his relationship to the media figures lionized in this book, which I discuss further below. In any case, while this is certainly a reasonable stylistic choice, to not insert the author unnecessarily, the reader can\u2019t escape the lurking suspicion that Bowden is hiding something that reflects poorly on him in the context of this book.This summary makes \u201cHue 1968\u201d sound like a reasonable, if narrowly focused and perhaps overly long, book. It is not a reasonable book. The problem comes in in the interstices. Nearly every page contains moral equivalency, apologetics for the Communists, and inflated accusations against Americans and the ARVN. It\u2019s not that Bowden is the new Jane Fonda, who, let\u2019s not forget, was open about her personal desire to kill American soldiers. Bowden is not completely a propagandist for the Communists: for example, he writes about the famous photograph of South Vietnam\u2019s national police chief, Nguyen Ngoc Loan, shooting a Viet Cong officer prisoner in the head, that \u201cthis fellow had been busy that morning shooting scores of people in cold blood.\u201d Bowden does not note, though, that Loan had personally that day witnessed the murder of one of his officers by the man executed, along with the officer\u2019s wife and three small children.But with a few exceptions like this, bad actions by the Communists are covered with a warm, gauzy film, ascribed to unknowable causes with unknowable perpetrators, explained away, or simply minimized. You can be sure the \u201cwife and three small children\u201d would have entered the story if the Viet Cong had executed an ARVN officer who had done the same\u2014but no American or ARVN soldier did anything like that during the battle. Any American or ARVN action is always given the worst possible construction\u2014even though, with Communists, the actual examples given of atrocities are innumerable, and not a single American or ARVN deliberate killing of any civilian or prisoner shows up, not even as hearsay. The worst Bowden can point to is that assembled North Vietnamese prisoners were sometimes \u201ckicked and slapped\u201d by the ARVN, which obviously pales in comparison.Still, Bowden keeps reaching, page after page. Thus, when an American soldier shoots a woman trying to escape the city to the North Vietnamese camp outside, having been given orders to shoot absolutely anyone leaving on that path, he is worried he shot a civilian just trying to get vaway from the battle. He is very relieved that the woman is found with a map of all the American gun emplacements in the area, and is thus obviously a spy. Bowden\u2019s verdict? \u201cThe map, of course, was also exactly what people would make before trying to pick their way out of a dangerous spot.\u201d Maybe\u2014but when every single story ends with some similar stretching attempt to either exculpate Communists or make Americans look bad, the reader begins to realize that Bowden has an agenda, and it\u2019s not to relate history with a neutral eye.Or, after the battle, Bowden notes in passing the thousands of dead, many bound with bullet holes in the head. But most \u201cwere probably victims of the intense artillery bombardment.\u201d Of course, there are a few exceptions, barely worth mentioning in between castigating \u201cWesty.\u201d \u201cOne of those who had been killed was their late father\u2019s cousin, a senator, who was said to have been buried alive. Many more\u2014the exact numbers would be hard to pin down\u2014had been rounded up and executed.\u201d But no matter: \u201cThere was plenty of blame to go around for all this killing, and neither side had the time or the means to sort it out.\u201d No real differences to see here; just move along.\u201cThe top Front commander inside the Citadel, Lieutenant Tang Van Mieu, believed the Americans were using civilians as shields. He saw so many moving in and immediately behind enemy lines that it was impossible to fire on marines without hitting civilians. But the same was true on his side of the line, and if the Americans were playing that game, he could, too.\u201d We are expected to believe that a top Communist commander actively involved in executing thousands of civilians for ideological reasons, a subscriber to a belief system that in every one of its wars of aggression across the past century has always regarded civilian collateral casualties as a matter of total indifference in achieving Utopia, only used civilians as shields because he thought the Americans were? This in a city where the civilian uprising universally expected and relied upon for victory by the Communists did not occur at all, thus making it clear under Communist theory that all the civilians were collaborators with the enemies of Communism? Not likely. Bowden\u2019s footnote to this officer\u2019s claim actually says, \u201cEach side has accused the other of this practice, and while it was not the official policy of either, it is easy to imagine individual soldiers or units taking advantage of the proximity of civilians under the circumstances.\u201d It\u2019s only easy to imagine if your premise is moral equivalence, or more accurately, that the real demons were the Americans and ARVN. Not to mention that \u201ctaking advantage of the proximity of civilians,\u201d phrased using the neutral, passive voice always favored by Bowden when talking about Communist atrocities, isn\u2019t what most people define as \u201cusing human shields.\u201dPretty much everywhere Bowden chooses the least emotive word possible for the atrocities of the Communists, even when forced to describe horrors. Thus, the mass killings by Communists are uniformly called \u201cpurges,\u201d a word usually reserved for intra-Communist ideological purification. \u201cNear the Gia Hoi School, where the most notorious of the purges was being orchestrated, an entire family, including children, had been killed because a VC soldier believed their TV set was a method of communicating with the Americans.\u201d We are, of course, told no more about this \u201cmost notorious of purges.\u201d \u201c[T]oddlers in one house were killed by VC soldiers who swung them by the heels and crushed their heads against a wall.\u201d \u201cAn older sergeant, a large black man, took [a newly arrived American soldier] into a bombed-out house on his first day and showed him a Vietnamese family, man and woman and children, all dead. They had been wired together before being shot and set on fire. \u2018I know what you learned in high school, but this is what Communism really is,\u2019 the sergeant said.\u201dAll this is, of course, counterpoised in the next sentence with a supposed moral equivalent: \u201cTinh Hoa, a bookstore owner, left his house to look for food and water and was shot dead\u2014\u2018Some people guess that it was the Viet Cong who shot him, and other people are absolutely sure that it was the Americans, but whoever fired the shot, Mr. Tinh Hoa nevertheless got killed.\u2019\u201d Totally missing here, and anywhere in the book? Any suggestion, any at all, that Americans or the ARVN engaged in deliberate killing of civilians. Realizing this suggests a lack of his precious moral equivalency, Bowden\u2019s very next sentence is \u201cAmerican soldiers shot a dog that had fallen into the river. As it struggled to swim back to the shore, the men continued shooting, not to kill the animal but out of sheer cruelty, to prolong its suffering by keeping it from reaching the bank\u2014\u2018The dog gradually gets farther and farther away from the shore, howling plaintively; it\u2019s absolutely heartrending.\u2019\u201d So in one of the very few paragraphs in which Bowden discusses specifics of the innumerable atrocities of the Communists (as opposed to the endless paragraphs neutrally describing dead bodies and infrastructure devastation), equal time is given to a civilian whom nobody knows who shot, and to a dog (and elsewhere Bowden notes that dogs were always shot because they fed on human bodies). The dog is \u201cheartrending\u201d and its treatment \u201csheer cruelty\u201d; the wired, burnt and dead children don\u2019t rate any adjectives. And this is not me cherry picking a few examples to make Bowden look bad; this is the book.Bowden sums up, \u201cThere were so many ways to die in Hue that it became impossible to sort causes.\u201d Our conclusion, naturally, should be \u201cBut there was blame enough for both sides. The storm of war blew flat all semblance of law, logic, and decency.\u201d Accidental deaths in urban fighting are the same as deliberately killing children. Nothing to see here, just the nature of war. Move along.Why, the reader wonders, does Bowden engage in this false moral equivalence? After some thought, the reason becomes clear. Moral equivalence has been the default mode of the Left with respect to Communism ever since the 1950s (prior to which they actively favored and helped the Communists, often by betraying their own countries). It is hard to tell what Bowden\u2019s personal politics are, but it is not hard to tell that he is desperate to ingratiate himself with the American journalist community, of which he is a member and which is nearly 100% hard Left. He doesn\u2019t (probably) favor Communism. He certainly wants the cool kids to praise him, and they won\u2019t praise him if he doesn\u2019t validate their own actions to attack America during the Vietnam War and, implicitly, all their politicized actions since.Bowden is clear about the agenda of these journalists. \u201cWar correspondents had become so uniformly antiwar that, to those running the war, they appeared intent on painting the worst possible picture. There was some justification for that opinion.\u201d But Bowden never inquires, given the massive support for the war at home, and its support by most soldiers (whom Bowden uniformly portrays as clueless about the war and Vietnam), why this was or what effect it might have on reporting. Instead, he simpers on about the heroism of these same reporters, never suggesting they are anything but paragons of virtue and neutral journalism.Bowden particularly lionizes a pair of left-wing journalists: Gene Roberts, of the \u201cNew York Times\u201d and the \u201cPhiladelphia Inquirer\u201d (to whom this book is dedicated), and David Halberstam, incarnation of the self-absorbed Baby Boomers, both accomplishers of nothing important yet convinced of their world-bestriding importance. (Halberstam\u2019s pinched, ugly and ludicrous book \u201cThe Fifties\u201d is perhaps the best example of the navel-lint-gazing of the Baby Boomers.) Bowden praises Halberstam, in 1962, for verbally attacking the US Ambassador to South Vietnam, and being ushered out the Ambassador\u2019s office as a result. He seems to think this is some kind of heroic action. Bowden notes that \u201cIn past conflicts, correspondents had been considered part of the team,\u201d with the implication that was bad. He never considers why, even in 1962, journalists had quit the team, and then went to work for the other team. To inquire would be to raise unpleasant questions with even more unpleasant answers. Better to natter on about supposed journalistic heroism, and receive the accolades of 2017.Much adulatory ink is also devoted to Walter Cronkite. Bowden ascribes Cronkite\u2019s becoming a partisan against the war after the Battle of Hue to a feeling that he had been used by the government. \u201cIf it had happened, he needed to correct it, even if that meant abandoning strict journalistic neutrality, one of his core beliefs.\u201d Bowden offers no evidence that was, in fact, a core belief of Cronkite, and he offers massive evidence that all other journalists covering Vietnam were active partisans opposing the war, and in many cases, favoring the Communists. No doubt the government was putting a false spin on the war. But isn\u2019t it just as likely that the people who were really feeding lies to Cronkite were his fellow journalists farther down the journalist food chain? Certainly, in my lifetime, the media has always been aggressive advocates for every leftist cause that rolls down the pike, and the idea of journalistic neutrality, though often mentioned as a touchstone, has always been wholly laughable, ending in what we see today, where the media is openly merely an extension of the more leftist elements of the Democratic Party. \u201cIt was hard to imagine an American more conventional and authentic than Walter Cronkite.\u201d Many believed that, but it was obviously a fraud. I remember Cronkite from my youth as a tendentious, not very bright, one-dimensional leftist, proponent of imposing world government, constantly attacking Christians and the \u201cright-wing,\u201d preaching environmental disaster while, of course, opposing a wind farm that might block his luxury property on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The same aging lawyer hippies I used to needle loved Cronkite, and I can see why.Bowden realizes who is evil in this story. He just wishes it were otherwise, so he pretends. But the nature of his tale shows it, and it also shows that American reporters knew it, and concealed it. Early in the book, Bowden notes that \u201cReporters who went out into the fields could see it for themselves. The Viet Cong were not the idealistic warriors of American antiwar propaganda; they were vicious. They relied on terror.\u201d Yet not in a single place does Bowden cite any reporter making any statement critical of the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese, while scores of statements criticizing America and the ARVN are presented, often times multiple ones on a page, both in reporting of the time and in simple conversations. So Bowden admits that the Viet Cong were \u201cvicious\u201d and \u201crelied on terror.\u201d Whatever the defects of the South Vietnamese government, no serious person could maintain it was as bad as the Communists. But this entire book is devoted to projecting the necessary conclusion to the reader that they were the same, and that cripples what could have been an interesting work of history."}, {"userName": "Mark Miano", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62719487-mark-miano", "userReview": "Perhaps because I'm approaching my 50th birthday, I seem to be reading a lot of books about the seminal political, cultural, and social moments of my childhood.

The lynchpin of Tet was the capture of Hue, Vietnam\u2019s intellectual and cultural capital, by 10,000 National Liberation Front troops who descended from hidden camps and surged across the city of 140,000. Within hours the entire city was in their hands save for two small military outposts. American commanders refused to believe the size and scope of the Front\u2019s presence, ordering small companies of marines against thousands of entrenched enemy troops. After several futile and deadly days, Lieutenant Colonel Ernie Cheatham would finally come up with a strategy to retake the city, block by block and building by building, in some of the most intense urban combat since World War II.With unprecedented access to war archives in the U.S. and Vietnam and interviews with participants from both sides, Bowden narrates each stage of this crucial battle through multiple viewpoints. Played out over 24 days and ultimately costing 10,000 lives, the Battle of Hue was by far the bloodiest of the entire war. When it ended, the American debate was never again about winning, only about how to leave.
