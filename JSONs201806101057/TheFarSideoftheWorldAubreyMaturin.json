That's not to say newcomers couldn't begin mid-way through the series by picking up this - #10 and literally the exact middle - and not enjoy themselves. One of the smart things Patrick O'brian did was to make each book self-contained. Now granted, there is a story thread passing through the series from start to finish and you'd be better served starting at the beginning. However, O'Brian gives enough backstory to bring anyone and everyone up to speed, so that you can enjoy these books as one-offs.That is also part of the problem with these books, they tend to start slow because of all the backstory given. Also, O'Brian spends some time setting up the action to come. There is necessary information to deliver to the readers and there is unnecessary-but-welcome foreshadowing. All of that means the story doesn't usually get underway for a few chapters. But I suggest just sitting back and enjoying the subtly with which the author delicately maneuvers his readers through dangerous plot shoals and takes them out to clear-sailing deep blue waters. The Far Side of the World contains almost no sea battles, yet herein you'll find shocking violence of a different nature. Human nature can be fickle, funny and frightening. Readers are treated to a little bit of everything in this one as love sours and blooms aboard ship, and the consequences are brutal. I've read book #10 about three or four times now over the years with a gap in between each time just long enough that I forget the most unexpected turn the story takes. Those caught up in the sea battle chases that this series so often deliver spectacularly might be disappointed, but found it to be a dangerous and delightful detour away from the norm. Those familiar with the movie \"Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World\" will see that director Peter Weir took the basic structure of his movie from this book. However, it is not faithful from start to finish. For instance, our hero's quarry isn't the same, though the goal is similar. The movie takes bits from a few of the books and patches together a plot of its own, while maintaining the overall feel of O'brian's work in a way that made this fan happy. And likewise, I believe fans of the movie should find plenty of enjoyment in these books."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cMartin was a thoroughly amiable man, a man of wide reading, but when he came to write he mounted upon a pair of stilts, unusually lofty stilts, and staggered along at a most ungracious pace, with an occasional awkward lurch into colloquialism, giving a strikingly false impression of himself.\u201d \u2015 Patrick O'Brian, The Far Side of the World'The Far Side of the World' is driven by a fairly simple plot. It is a chase, a hunt, a sea race from Gibraltar, down around Cape Horn into the Pacific. The Surprise has been tasked with intercepting the American frigate the Norfolk as it hunts for British whalers in the Great South Sea on the Far Side of the World. The benefit of this novel's simple plot structure is it really boils the book down to what makes the series great: O'Brian's nautical prose and the relationship between Dr. Stephen Maturin and Captain Jack Aubrey. The relationship between Maturin and Aubrey is one that captures the unique relationship that forms between some men in battle, war, etc., that seems to almost transcend relationships of blood or the liquid link of lovers. Some of the most touching parts of this novel are those lines where Captain Aubrey recognizes how his role as captain requires him to do something that will cause distress or pain to Dr. Maturin. The affection is real. It is honest. It is mature. The amazing thing is this type of love between men almost NEVER gets exposed in modern literature or art. Again, I say almost because there are example, but the great thing about this series is O'Brian lets this relationship grow and develop and adds complexities to it that are unparalleled anywhere in literature. I also adore how these two men explore two great models* of masculinity. Captain Aubrey (to me) represents almost a Ruler form of masculinity while Doctor Maturin represents the Explorer form. These two men, with these two very distinct FORMS and WAYS of BEING men are able to interact, cooperate, resolve conflict, etc., through their linked affection, to a world at war and a world unknown. I read these novels and I believe there is nothing that Victorian rules and the Age of Enlightenment can't accomplish.* Borrowing a bit from Clare W. Graves here."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[ This is what you get, Mr. Martin, for declaring that sex is a chore and a decent woman will not enjoy it, not even with her husband  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "It's always nice to revisit Aubrey and Maturin. I've only read a couple books from this series, and I never feel any serious need to find more installments, but I always enjoy them when I do. And this is one of the best ones - not only because it's pretty similar to the movie version and picking out what they changed/didn't change for the adaptation is a fun game, but also for other reasons, which I will now list:-Plots! So many plots. Almost too many plots.This book is just over four hundred pages, and there is A LOT happening. The main story concerns the Surprise trying to track an American ship, the Norfolk, around South American (the movie changed the bad guys into Frenchmen, first because it connects better to the threat of Napoleon and also AMERICA FUCK YEAH). But there's more. Maturin has a spying subplot, as he often does, and there's a nice scene where Jack helps him figure out where a secret letter has been hidden. Then the Surprise itself is a little fuller than usual, as the ship is carrying a bunch of twelve-year-olds who are learning about ship life (let's call them interns), which was included in the movie - but there's also a bunch of crewmen who were recruited from an insane asylum, and also two crewmen bring their wives along. So in addition to the multiple plots, we also have a ton of characters to keep track of, but luckily they're all a lot of fun. Also we have the tension created between Maturin and Aubrey when Aubrey cancels the former's day trip to the shore and Maturin gets all huffy about it. And there's a big scandal where one of the crewmen has an affair with one of the women and it does not end well. And towards the end of the book Aubrey and Maturin fall overboard (or, more accurately, Maturin falls overboard and Aubrey jumps in to save him) and are lost at sea, and then rescued by a boat crewed entirely by Polynesian women who plan to castrate them (why the hell was that not in the movie?). And then Aubrey captures a bunch of prisoners and the crew of the captured ship and the Surprise have to stay on an island together while Aubrey tries to keep everyone from killing each other.Quick - without looking, tell me the name of the American ship they're trying to catch. See what I mean about almost too many plots? It can be hard to keep up with, but luckily it's all very exciting and well-written, so even if you're not 100% sure what's going on, you're still having a good time.-Lots of fun detailsO'Brian's books are always impressively researched, but it seemed like there was an extra amount of good insider information about ships in the 1800s here. There are details about the Sunday services given on English ships (sailors were woken up half an hour earlier, to give them time to clean up for services), the sheer number of different people who traveled on ships (see: crewmen's wives and the interns, and it's very cute because the two women are in charge of the kids' lessons onboard), and the ceremonies involved in taking a ship and its crew prisoner. I also now exactly what grog is - I always knew it was watered-down rum, but apparently they also added lemon juice and sugar to it, and someone should really put that in a Mason jar and sell it to hipsters for $15. Additionally, there are a lot of descriptions about the food served on the ship, like this passage about the meal served at a fancy dinner in Aubrey's cabin:\"'Mr. Martin,' said Jack, after the chaplain had said grace, 'It occurred to me that perhaps you might not yet have seen lobscouse. It is one of the oldest of the forecastle dishes, and eats very savory when it is well made: I used to enjoy it prodigiously when I was young. Allow me to help you to a little.'Alas, when Jack was young he was also poor, often penniless; and this was a rich man's lobscouse, a Lord Mayor's lobscouse. Orrage had been wonderfully generous with his slush, and the liquid fat stood half an inch deep over the whole surface, while the potatoes and pounded biscuit that ordinarily made up the bulk of the dish could scarcely be detected at all, being quite overpowered by the fat meat, fried onions, and powerful spices.\"...yum? Either way, you gotta admire the detail that went into this book. O'Brian knows his stuff.And now we come to my favorite aspect of this book.-Ladies! (yeah!) Ladies! (yeah!)In addition to the two women on board the Surprise (one of whom gets a really good, albeit tragic, subplot where she has an affair with one of the crewmen), there's the previously-mentioned bit where Aubrey and Maturin get rescued by a ship of Polynesian women. Polynesian women who decorate the masthead of their ship with the severed dicks of their victims. Also one of the women jumps into the ocean and kills a shark with a knife. Okay, on the one hand, I understand why this was left out of the movie version, because it would be a total distraction from the whole let's-get-the-French plot. But on the other hand, where is my movie about a ship full of castrating Polynesian women! Scratch that, I want a miniseries. Anyway, that entire subplot is awesome, and combined with the two women who travel on the Surprise, completely obliterates the argument that female characters don't belong in seafaring stories because \"it's not historically accurate!\" Check and mate, says O'Brian. Also the Polynesian women are fantastic because they prompt this conversation between Stephen Maturin and another man, which I will reproduce in its entirety because that's how happy it made me:\"'No,' said Martin, 'I saw nothing but a swarthy crew of ill-looking female savages, full of maligned fury, a disgrace to their sex.''I dare say they had been ill-used, the creatures,' said Stephen.'Perhaps they had,' said Martin. 'But to carry resentment to the point of the emasculation you described seems to me inhumane, and profoundly wicked.''Oh, as far as unsexing is concerned, who are we to throw stones? With us any girl that cannot find a husband is unsexed. If she is very high or very low she may go her own way, with the risks entailed therein, but otherwise she must either have no sex or be disgraced. She burns, and she is ridiculed for burning. To say nothing of male tyranny - a wife or a daughter being a mere chattel in most codes of law or custom - and brute force - to say nothing of that, hundreds of thousands of girls are unsexed every generation: and barren women are as much despised as eunuchs. I do assure you, Martin, that if I were a woman I should march out with a flaming torch and a sword; I should emasculate right and left.'\"(at this point, I have to point out that earlier in the book Maturin refuses to perform an abortion on a woman who tells him that her husband will literally kill her if he finds out she's pregnant, so way to put your money where your mouth is, douche. But the speech is still awesome, and Maturin is still great.)"}, {"userName": "Wealhtheow", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow", "userReview": "[ And lo and behold, her husband does indeed kill her.

Surprise, which Aubrey commands. Needless to say, naval practices were different 200 years ago. Along with two women, the Surprise is carrying a cat belonging to the bosun, a goat named Aspasia to provide milk, and a handful of other animals taken along as food. Though one of the women (whose name already escapes me) plays only a small and benign role, the gunner\u2019s wife, Mrs. Horner, proves to be a dangerous temptation for another member of the crew, and mayhem results. What\u2019s more, when two members of the crew fall overboard in the Pacific one night and are left behind (during which one of them observes that the sea is as warm as milk, a nice telltale reminder of the absence of refrigeration), they\u2019re plucked from the water the next morning by a small band of oceangoing women warriors, who dispatch sharks with ease and are inclined to do the same to the crewmen. Knowing little of South Seas anthropology, I can\u2019t judge whether this fantastical episode draws on fact or fancy, but it reads like a believable surprise, and it prompts a short proto-feminist response from Maturin, who ends by declaring that \u201cIf I were a woman I should march out with a flaming torch and a sword; I should emasculate right and left.\u201dIt\u2019s not only women who upset the desired order of things among the men who constitute our central characters. The mission of the Surprise, based in Gibraltar as the tale begins, is to go in search of an American frigate that, according to an intelligence report, is heading to the Pacific to wreak havoc on British whalers there. Thus the Surprise and her crew confront the stifling heat and lack of wind in the horse latitudes; a squall that rips the bowsprit away (while the ship is refitting up a river in Brazil, Maturin meets a Peruvian who introduces him to the coca leaf); the howling winds and icy temperatures off Cape Horn; the quest for food and water, which leads to a spell at Juan Fernandez Island; a pass through the Galapagos Islands (already renowned to naturalists decades before Darwin\u2019s visit), which Maturin and his friend Martin are allowed to see but forbidden to explore; and the seemingly impossible task of finding one particular ship in the ocean.O\u2019Brian\u2019s language is one of the pleasures of this series. Here, three relative landlubbers take a swipe at the nautical terminology in which these stories abound:Now there was a pause, and Yarrow said, \u201cI dare say they are hauling away the cat before hooking on the fish.\u201dPocock said, \u201cPerhaps they will stopper with a dog.\u201dStephen said, \u201cIt is my belief that they have raised a mouse, and that having seized it with a fox they will clap on a lizard.\u201d\u201cLord, what jargon the honest creatures have invented, upon my word,\u201d said Pocock, laughing heartily for the first time in Stephen\u2019s acquaintance with him. \u201cWere your terms authentic?\u201d\u201cThey were indeed,\u201d said Stephen. \u201cAnd there are hounds too, somewhere about the masts.\u201d\u201cSo were my cat and fish,\u201d said Yarrow.A practiced reader of the series will suspect that these landsmen have got the words right but misapprehended their usage. Practically everyone will know what Jack has gotten wrong when he observes to Stephen, \u201cBut there are more things than heaven and earth, you know.\u201d And those with a taste for the prose and narrative style of times past will appreciate O\u2019Brian\u2019s way of condensing a discussion into the sort of catalogue that (in my experience) more often appeared at the head of a section or chapter. Maturin and Martin are studying the plates of a particular giant tortoise of the Galapagos Islands through telescopes:\u2026comparing them with those of Testudo aubreii, which Maturin had discovered, described and named,\u2026 and with the thin-shelled and lighter though still respectable tortoise of Rodriguez. Reflections upon insular tortoises, their origin \u2014 tortoises in general, whether deaf \u2014 their voices rarely heard \u2014 capable of a harsh cry however as well as the more usual hiss \u2014 all oviparous, careless of their young \u2014 crocodiles more diligent as parents \u2014 but tortoises more generally sympathetic \u2014 perfectly capable of attachment \u2014 instances of affection in tortoises.To employ a more modern expression, gotta love it."}, {"userName": "Jamie Collins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins", "userReview": "[as a devout Catholic, he refuses to perform an abortion even though he acknowledges that the woman\u2019s life is endangered by her pregnancy.

There are aspects of it that probably deserve a three at best. The plot itself isn't actually all that compelling: the story simply plods along from one adventure or crisis to the next, framed by the overarching back-cover-synopsis plot (which occupies remarkably little of the book). The characters are memorable, but I can't think of a single one that really develops during the story. But what brings the overall rating up to five stars is the author's incredible use of language. The characters speak from the page as vividly as the best of Twain's. The wit and wordplay is top-notch. It's such a delight to read that I found myself constantly wanting to read passages aloud to people around me. I've not had such simple fun reading a book in a long time, and I can't wait to read some more in the (prolific) series."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna", "userReview": "This must be one of my favourite instalments of the Aubrey and Maturin series. It contains a good many exciting pursuits, terrible storms, unfortunate misadventures, amusing puns, appealing creatures, even some frightening and sad moments. The whole book concerns one very long voyage to the South Pacific and thus there is a lot more in the way of ship shenanigans than spy happenings. As usual, I laughed out loud many times, for example at Jack misquoting \"Lead on, Macbeth,\" only for a crewman named Macbeth to mistake it for an order. This description also tickled me: 'Valparaiso was notorious for possessing nothing, and that nothing of the very lowest quality as well as exorbitantly dear and delivered only after endless delay'.The relationship of Aubrey and Maturin is especially central to this book. Stephen sulking at not being allowed to visit the Galapagos, Jack diving after in after Stephen falls into the sea (again), and their attempts to gather coconuts on a desert island are all delightful. Both have endearing quirks: Jack\u2019s continued attempts to be witty, Stephen\u2019s newfound taste for coca leaves, both of their particularity about coffee and grilled cheese. I also appreciated the many flora and fauna that appeared, including regular cameos from Scourge the ship\u2019s cat and Aspasia the ship\u2019s goat. How could you fail to smile at lines like, 'They met on the quay, Lopez accompanied by an embarrassing, unnecessary spider monkey that had to be menaced and hissed at to make it go home'. I won\u2019t spoil things any further by detailing all that I enjoyed, suffice it to say that 'The Far Side of the World' is exceptional even by Patrick O\u2019Brian\u2019s high standards. I couldn\u2019t help noticing that the plot of the film adaptation does not bear very close resemblance to the book. I can understand why, though, as too much occurs to be easily fitted into film format.

This book contained much more of the sailor's superstitions than the other books and there was a more serious falling out between Jack and Stephen than in previous volumes as well, adding some further depth to their relationship. Overall, really enjoyed it. In the volume I have there is an essay on Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels by Charlton Heston. Of course it is an admirer's perspective but it is a good essay. Especially good is the examination of Jack and Stephen's friendship. Heston points out that in great literature, most friendships among the main characters is merely asserted (like Tom Sawyer and Nigger Jim, Holmes and Watson, etc.), whereas in O'Brian's novels, the friendship is the key element and the heart of the books. Thinking about this point a bit more, one is hard pressed to find a friendship which is displayed and explored more than the one in the center of this series."}, {"userName": "Shira", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19806749-shira", "userReview": "Excellent social commentary well-couched, with very well distinguished voices."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1512868-lisa", "userReview": "Patrick O\u2019Brian\u2019s Aubrey/Maturin series is one of my favourites of all time.

As O\u2019Brian is deceased and the series numbers twenty books, I\u2019ve been making sure that I don\u2019t binge on them so that I\u2019ll know that I have a new adventure with them waiting for me each year for the foreseeable future (and yes, I realise that this is rather sad of me). Now halfway through the series, the previously confusing sailing terms now seem like second nature, and I\u2019m as in love as I ever was with the rest of the writing.In The Far Side of The World, the wars with the French in which our characters were introduced have long since ended and, instead, we\u2019re now at war with America. Aubrey, in command of HMS Surprise \u2013 a ship that\u2019s already seen him through more than a few scrapes \u2013 is given the mission of pursuing an American ship, the Norfolk, and protecting British whalers in the Pacific from her depradations. On her way to intercepting the Americans, the Surprises will face onboard adultery, murder-suicides, the loss of its surgeon and captain overboard (and their subsequent \u2018rescue\u2019 by a boat of women native to the area, intent on castrating them), massive storms, sharks and, finally, a tense stand-off on a deserted island under the terms of a dubious peace. Meanwhile, Stephen makes a potentially dangerous error in judgement, before almost getting his skull sawn open by the ship\u2019s parson after knocking himself into a coma on the ship\u2019s guns.The writing on display is as wonderful as ever, and I love how O\u2019Brian depicts the various relationships onboard (even when they\u2019re unsavoury, which they often are). And even though he\u2019s now running out of real life events to exploit \u2013 as per his admission at the start of this book \u2013 his ways around that, often centring on Stephen\u2019s passion for naturalism and the crew\u2019s handling of the ship itself in the face of Mother Nature\u2019s fury, delights me as much as his splendid sea battles did.I can\u2019t recommend this series highly enough \u2013 even for those, like me, who prefer to stay on dry land and wouldn\u2019t know a topsail from a taffrail.**Also posted at Cannonball Read 9**"}, {"userName": "Leigh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11974253-leigh", "userReview": "I have never read a book so dissimilar in plot line from the movie and yet both are very good, it's weird."}, {"userName": "Sean Lee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56615058-sean-lee", "userReview": "Slow start, epic finish.

The film by Peter Weir made a pretty good attempt at putting those books on screen, and it was entertaining piece of cinema in its own right, but it lacked a certain something. The script was actually a collage of incidents drawn from all the books; from 'The Far Side of the World' the film borrows the voyage to the Galapagos islands, and one or two other ideas and themes, but for the most part they are better considered as entirely different things.The book begins in Gibraltar, a place which by now is starting to seem like an old friend to Aubrey and Maturin. There\u2019s a cloak and dagger feel to the first few chapters, where the roots of intrigue stretch all the way back some four entire books to The Fortune of War. The short version is that Stephen is hunted, and it is decided that the best thing for him would be a mission to somewhere very far away where he might be beyond the attention of the Americans and the French. An opportunity presents itself: Aubrey\u2019s old favourite, the HMS Surprise, is dispatched in pursuit of the USS Norfolk, an American frigate that has been harassing British whaling vessels in the distant reaches of the Pacific ocean.And that\u2019s basically it. This long-distance pursuit over deep blue water is effectively the entirety of the plot. It makes rather a pleasant change from the intricacies of the preceding novels, and it feels like a deliberate return to a story of plain sailing. Most of the crew will be familiar names to anyone has made it this far, and it has the episodic feeling of the earliest books in the series. In some respects it feels like a kind of holiday. This is not to say it is all sunshine and light. The journey as a whole is extremely rough: there are storms, hunger, thirst, and there\u2019s one borderline absurd incident where Jack and Stephen are almost drowned. Unusually for O\u2019Brian, there\u2019s a total absence of sea battles in this book: it is all man against nature; or man against man\u2019s own better nature. But as ever, nothing is ever really allowed to arrest the progress of our heroes. The perfect example is where Stephen takes a very bad knock on the head while trying to spot a passing bird in a heavy sea; for a good few pages he is in a coma, and it only when the friendly American doctor is actually standing over him with a trepanning drill in hand that a piece of snuff falls into his nose, he sneezes, and awakens. Aside from the occasional callback, the whole thing is then forgotten. Put like this, it seems ridiculous \u2014 but the genius of these books is the effortless panache with which it is all carried off.And yet there are moments where the author inverts the reader\u2019s expectations with a confidence that is intensely compelling. The best example of that here is a sub-plot which comes to an end in one of the most horrifying moments in these stories thus far. Hollom, an officer, is having an affair with the only woman on the HMS Surprise, Mrs Horner; she is the wife of the gunner, Mr Horner. (The confluence of names here is bizarre \u2014 Hollom, Horner \u2014 and there\u2019s another unrelated man on board called Honey.) Everyone on the ship seems to know about this affair, but it attracts little in the way of comment. Then Mrs Horner becomes pregnant and approaches Stephen for help in securing an abortion; appalled, Stephen refuses to help her. While the Surprise is ashore for repairs, Mr Horner leads his wife and Hollom to a quiet place, and he murders them both.\u2018\u2026below him he heard the men in the foretop, unaware of his presence, talking in low urgent voices, little more than a whisper. They were upset; more upset than could be accounted for by a master\u2019s mate bolting with a gunner\u2019s wife on a warm and pleasant island. Whales again; a perfectly enormous school of them spouting over not much more than a mile of sea; he had never seen so many together \u2013 certainly more than two hundred. \u2018Innocent blood in the sun,\u2019 said a voice in the foretop: Vincent, a West Country lay preacher. \u2018Innocent blood my arse,\u2019 said another, probably old Phelps.\u2019The reader is not shown the act, but they are left in little doubt as to what happened when Horner returns to the ship late, covered in blood, and apparently out of his mind. There is no question of justice. Jack is sure that, out of respect and knowledge of the adulterous relationship, he would find no man to testify against the gunner. Incredibly, he takes no particular action, and nor does anybody else. But the question of what to do with Mr Horner is suddenly rendered moot when he hangs himself.In another book (by a different writer) this might have formed the basis of an entire novel\u2019s worth of material. But O\u2019Brian wraps it up quickly, as though it were just another spell of bad weather. The relationship between Horner and Hollom is sketched out as if glimpsed from a distance. They don\u2019t even have first names. These are not people the reader is privileged to know. As usual, the event is cause for some smart ruminations on Stephen\u2019s part about the nature of human sexuality; but nothing ever comes of it. Certainly there was never anything romantic about the situation. One implication, a joke in dubious taste, is that the gunner\u2019s impotence is the reason his wife is drawn to Hollom. In fact the whole tragedy feels like the zenith of some grim, anti-romantic parable. \u2018Innocent blood my arse.\u2019 Not that Stephen or Jack could ever be part of the punchline: they are, as ever, immune. Jack\u2019s part is to muddle through, while Stephen delivers the eloquent asides that comfort the reader into thinking the author is entirely aware of what is going on. I like this part, which comes after poor Martin is nearly murdered by a female crew of Pacific islanders fond of castration: \u2018Oh, as far as unsexing is concerned, who are we to throw stones? With us any girl that cannot find a husband is unsexed. If she is very high or very low she may go her own way, with the risks entailed therein, but otherwise she must either have no sex or be disgraced. She burns, and she is ridiculed for burning. To say nothing of male tyranny \u2013 a wife or a daughter being a mere chattel in most codes of law or custom \u2013 and brute force \u2013 to say nothing of that, hundreds of thousands of girls are in effect unsexed every generation: and barren women are as much despised as eunuchs. I do assure you, Martin, that if I were a woman I should march out with a flaming torch and a sword; I should emasculate right and left\u2026\u2019It might be considered strange that Maturin could come out with this, and yet he \u2014 and the book \u2014 demonstrate so little in the way of empathy for Mrs Horner. Is it a failure of imagination? She is placed in an impossible position. She is there only because her husband is there; she is alone amongst men who have themselves been separated from female company for months or even years; that much could be said of Diana Viliers in earlier books, but in the eyes of the author here, Mrs Horner does not merit anywhere near the same degree of attention. She begins as a nice face in the background until she is smudged out of the picture. If you were inclined to be generous, you could say that there\u2019s something deliberate in the austerity of this picture. Perhaps the novel simply reflects the way in which history is not written by women like Mrs Horner? Well, perhaps. But isn\u2019t it the job of the novelist to correct that? At this point in the series it becomes difficult to imagine a catastrophic event that could ever shake Aubrey and Maturin off the tracks to which they are so inseparably trained. Oddly, the closest we have ever got is Diana, but at this point she has been confined to the margins for what seems like years. But in terms of conventional naval disasters, they somehow exist in a zone beyond affect. I\u2019m thinking of something like the main event in Conrad\u2019s 'Lord Jim', where Jim abandons his ship full of pilgrims thinking it is about to suddenly sink, and then has to live with the consequences of knowing it had only run aground. Is it that the format of the books will not allow for the possibility of trauma, or is it something else?The simple fact that these books were written as part of a self-sustaining series doesn\u2019t do much to explain the way in which they were written. It is not hard to imagine a different set of historical novels where the protagonists would not live this strange perpetual life in a limbo of war and not-quite-war; where they might go back to Regency England and close out their lives in something resembling the shape of a conventional span of life, or at least of fiction. But there\u2019s something radical in this repeated insistence on the return to the ocean. The prospect of a grand overarching narrative is brought up afresh in every book, only to be quietly shelved for another tilt at the wild blue yonder."}, {"userName": "Gilly McGillicuddy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733051-gilly-mcgillicuddy", "userReview": "I was going to do what I usually do and just copypaste what I wrote in my LJ at the time I was actually reading the book, only to find out that my review for Chapter 3 ALONE was already far over the character limit here. Sigh!Instead I'll just copy my love-rant I wrote when I had just read Chapter 4 and his and Stephen's distracted duet. It'll have to do.'You are not offended by my moss, Stephen, are you?' asked Jack. You can't not love the man in moments like this. I am of a mind to challenge the entire world not to like Jack and still remain confident that not a single person will succeed. Lord, he is so amazing, you just want to be close to him and bask in the glow that is Jackness. Jack is LIFE. I think it is the fact that Jack loves life and he thoroughly shows it that draws you in. There was a bit in The Mauritius Command where Stephen was comparing Jack to Clonfert and talked of a \"Jack who has never played a part in his life, who has no need for any role\". It's that kind of honesty and openness that just sucks you in, regardless of the less admirable parts of his personality and regardless of the less positive things that his kind of simplicity can entail. You love him because he loves readily and unconditionally, you love him because he takes such obvious delight in his jokes, in his ship, in his life, in his morning coffee. You love him because he disregards Killick when he's being particularly shrewish and Stephen when he is the same. You love him because he honestly wishes the best for everyone. You love him because he loves Sophie. You love him because he loves Stephen. You love him because he would love you if he knew you and because he would naturally expect to be loved back but still be so utterly delighted that you would. You love that he turns red and wheezes when he laughs, and that the snores when he sleeps. You love that he takes his officers under his wing and feels their fortune as keenly as his own. You love that he professes not to be superstitious and is still every inch the sailor. You love that he wears his hair long and his hat athwart. You love that he can have mindless flings but does feel guilty over Mrs Smith. You love the way he revives when he gets another letter from Sophie. You love how he could never leave the sea to stay with her, even though you might want him to sometimes. You love his attention to gunnery and his devotion to his men. You love how he can get more speed out of every scrap of sail than anyone else. You love him when there is not a trace to be seen of the child in him and you love when there is nothing else to be seen but the child in him. You love that he will never say die. You love that he can be so boorish one instant and then turn around and play this most delicate of instruments and it somehow doesn't seem odd at all. You love that he can be Goldilocks and Lucky Jack and Captain Jno. Aubrey and just plain old Jack all rolled into one. You love that he can be larger than life, and still be so horribly inept. You love... I have no words. My head is aswim with what I want to say and I can't get it articulated properly. It's the sight of him holding on to the corner of a desk red-faced and wiping tears of laughter from his eyes, it's him sitting immovable and wet with morning dew in the maintop, his eyes trained on the shore and his hand clamped tight around a telescope, it's the intensity and focus that seems to emanate from him when he's about to engage a ship. It's all this and so much more and it's wrapped up in this generous great big mass of yellow-topped goodness that you can't help but want to crawl up next to.Lord, how I love that man. I'm sorry, I'll shut up now. I got carried away. I just... it's been a while since I cared this much for a book."}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2846441-karla", "userReview": "It was impossible to listen to this book and not think of the film the entire time. I was actually surprised by how much the movie adhered to it, although it was more in terms of themes and glimpses, rather than sticking to the actual plot. The plot as a whole was the same (chasing a ship around the Horn), but so much of the ancillary details had been altered.The character of Hollom was another of these \"same, but different\" elements - in the film, he is a wholly sympathetic character but in the book, while he does have the taint of Jonah about him, he has quite a few qualities of a snake in the grass. It doesn't make his end any less sad, though. The doomed-in-blood love triangle between he, the gunner, and the gunner's wife was a meaty little melodrama below decks that provided some periodic distraction from the overarching mission of chasing the Norfolk.One part of the plot that was wholly missing from the movie was the fact that Jack gets saddled with a bunch of asylum rejects because the Royal Navy is low on men. Since O'Brian is fastidious about adhering to historical fact, I have no reason to believe that a ship's captain never had this foisted upon him by an idiotic Admiralty. Given the wrong-headed and oblivious actions by the Admiralty in other matters, telling a captain he has to use mutineers and loonies to run his ship seems entirely probable. It's a wonder Britain ruled the seas as long as she did.In all, I absolutely loved this one and the many scenes with Maturin and his naturalist colleague Martin were very fun. I didn't think that listening to two guys talk about bugs and birds would be so entertaining.

While I know O'Brian based his work on the historical record, I preferred the movie's subterfuge and close-quarters ship battle to the anti-climatic wreck in the book.

Immagino che il film sia tratto da questo libro, pur adattato e limato forse un po' troppo, trasformando americani in francesi e lo sbarco causa tempesta, in sbarco causa incidente di Stephen Maturin. Attraversano l'equatore, il 50\u00b0 e il 60\u00b0 parallelo, doppiando l'estremit\u00e0 del sudamerica per arrivare fino alle isole polinesiane.

Da l\u00ec una divertente avventura in due, su un pahi polinesiano governato soltanto da donne seminude che tanto per cambiare odiano gli uomini (fa sorridere l'espressione \"oh povero me\" di Stephen quando si accorge che teschi umani rotolano nei cesti e appesi a dei bastoni ci sono curiosi oggetti a \"forma di sacchetto\", che il lettore non fatica a capire di cosa si tratti).

Jack finisce per capire che invece di dover dare la caccia a un nuovo nemico, finisce per dover catturare un vecchio nemico: l'equipaggio della Hermione, disertore, colpevole di aver ucciso gli ufficiali di bordo e aver consegnato la fregata agli spagnoli, sulla cui testa pende la condanna a morte inappellabile e una taglia. Finisce con l'equipaggio della Surprise sbarcato a bordo della lancia fatta a pezzi dai loro avversari, picche in mano, che cercano di resistere alla superiorit\u00e0 numerica degli americani, mentre una baleniera che batte bandiera statunitense sta entrando nella baia.
