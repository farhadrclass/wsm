I'm always a little anxious when I read a book by an author I don't know. Especially an author I meet on-line, on a site like this, etc. Let's just say I was anxious for no reason with this one. While reading it questions kept popping into my head, stuff I just knew I was going to have to ask Mrs. Williamson, to pick her brain a little. Then the question would be answered within a page or two. I think that happens a half a dozen times. It was so nice not to be left with these questions you're just wanting to know so bad about. Mrs. Williamson is a very, very strong person and she has a beautiful family, which she shows to us all throughout this book. (A little side note- there are pictures throughout the book- not too many, just enought to get a feel for each person and just enough to let you be able to really picture the person during a certain situation- I loved that.) I'm not as open minded as Mrs. Williamson is. I could tell that pretty quickly. I kind of wish I was. I'm very skeptical when someone tells me they had an out of body experience or that they were visited from the other side. Maybe it's because it's never happened to me but that's just the way I am. So, the parts where the author mentioned her deceased father coming to her and actually speaking to her were difficult for me. I just don't see it. On the other hand, I hope to God it really happened- because then maybe someday, before I die, I'll be a little more reassured about the after-life. I'm working on faith alone right now and a little reassurance wouldn't hurt. Near the end of the book the author mentioned the 'gift' being passed onto her daughter- this was tough to swallow for me to. I hope to have one (or more) conversations with Mrs. Williamson about the whole thing. I'm interested in hearing more and who knows- maybe she'll make a believer out of me. :)That's about the only thing that made the book a little harder for me. I have a lot of praise for how she handled the religious aspect of the book. There are many people, me being one of them who DO NOT like being preached to- I never felt that with this. The author talked about her ralationship with God, her faith yet she didn't harp on it, she said what needed to be said and left it alone. She didn't come across as snooty or snobby, as her faith is better because of this or that, she didn't act like people should follow her lead and follow her to wherever religon-wise- this went very far with me and I know it will with others too. Okay- the book tells about Debbie Williamson's life- it wasn't an easy one and she worked HARD to get through her problems. That deserves something there with so many people laying the blame for their own faults on someone else in these times. It was refreshing to read about someone having their faults, dealing with them in an incorrect way, realizing it, trying to fix it, and becoming a better person for it. I enjoyed learning about how the relationships between her and her family members changed and grew also- particularly her mother and kids. I wouldn't suggest keeping this on the shelf for too long- it's one of those books where when you do finally grab it down to read you want to kick yourself for missing out for so long. One more thing- the way Mrs. Williamson writes is fantastic! The whole story just flowed and this being a first novel- that's a pretty cool feat, especially when talking about subjects as harsh as are dealt with here. I mentioned this to a friend and I'll mention it to the author as well, but I hope she's still writing. In my opinion she could go on writing, in many more different ways. One more thing again- I definitely think Stand can be of help to a lot of people, women specifically."}, {"userName": "Love", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1894862-love", "userReview": "I loved this book never in all my years of reading this type story has one been so much like mine. I could identify with so much that she was going through.I think sometimes it is very hard to just get over what happens to us as children or adults for that matter. I can only say one thing I would have a hard time agreeing with, that is being able to hug the abuser. I feel I would have a very hard time doing so. But maybe I am a weak person for this. Anyway it is a great book to read if you need help dealing with what has happened to you in the past.

I have never had to deal with sexual abuse, or really any kind of abuse, but I have had my own trials.

This is the story of Debbie Williamsons life as a sexually abused nine year old and her final resolution with her uncle who was her abuser. The book tells not just of her early experiences but also of the abuse her mother suffered from her stepfather. Both of them were threatened by their abusers that if they told, something bad would happen.It is amazing that they both found their way out of the hell their lives had become."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3348268-shannon", "userReview": "A very straight-forward, touching story.

Stand was raw and powerful and gut wrenching, but it was an absolutely amazing experience that i am honored to have shared with the author.Hi, my name\u2019s Debbie. I am a whore. I am a slut. I have had so many affairs. I\u2019ve cheated on my husband for years. I am a liar. I\u2019m not worthy of anything. I\u2019m not trustworthy; you can\u2019t trust me. This is who I am.with this proclamation, Debbie claims her failure, taking responsibility for her life, and attempts to break the cycle of abuse that was set in motion decades before. at the age of 9, Williamson was raped by her 22 year old uncle and, years later, in the midst of her own failed marriage and recklessness, she attempts to regain control of her life and stop the cycle of abuse and neglect that she has plagued her family for so long.Stand chronicles three generations of abuse in Williamson\u2019s family, both physical and emotional, that had run so deep. domestic abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, alcoholism and neglect \u2013 it was all present in varying levels. her grandmother Bessie, after being widowed, remarried an abusive man who ruled the house with a firm hand, trickling down physical and sexual abuse to the children, and even among siblings. Lois, Williamson\u2019s mother continued the pattern of abuse by neglecting her children and cheating on her own husband rather publicly. Debbie found herself in a place of self loathing when she woke up one day and realized that she had become just like her mother, cheating, drinking and neglecting her own children.the writing is stark and painful to read, loud and honest with the long lasting pain of abuse, and yet the overlaying message is that of hope. Williamson takes hold of her life and shakes out all of the skeletons and i can only imagine the courage that it must have taken to write this book. it is an unfortunate truth that so many children face the same sad situations and come away so damaged that the pattern of abuse is only repeated generation after generation, but Williamson\u2019s testimony is a glimmer of hope that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.i would absolutely recommend this for anyone that has been abused or knows anyone affected by abuse, in any way. it is not a book that i can say was enjoyable or good (that just doesn\u2019t seem right), but i can\u2019t say enough how much i appreciated it."}, {"userName": "Bookventures Book Club", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3538038-bookventures-book-club", "userReview": "For some reason, I had some difficulty putting this review together. Maybe it\u2019s because this story has no characters that you can like or dislike or a plot that you can pick apart. You\u2019re peeking into someone\u2019s life and this someone just happen to have been a victim of sexual abuse. Debbie Williamson\u2019s story is heart wrenching but yet carries a power message; you have to take a stand against abuse in order to break the cycle reclaim your life.Debbie narrates the story as she takes you through the generation of abuse that engulfed the women and men in her family. Saying that his book is emotionally charged is an understatement. The author really makes you feel the anger, confusion, sadness and relief in the same waves that she experienced them and it\u2019s unclear as to whether it\u2019s the writing that helps you to feel this way or the fact that you can empathize with Debbie and what she went through. Another compelling force in the book are the photos of Debbie\u2019s family. They really help to bring the story close to home for the readers simply because there are times when reading this book, you think to yourself \u201cI can\u2019t believe that this actually happened\u201d. Additionally, the title of the book is also quite fitting since Debbie\u2019s story is also a clear testimony to the notion that abuse in whatever form is cyclic and you can either sit by and have the cycle repeat itself or you can take a stand. Aside from the obvious theme I also found spirituality being significant throughout the book. Debbie constantly makes reference to diary entries where she talks to God. She also credits her spiritual breakthrough and messages from the \u2018other side\u2019 for helping her get through her most difficult times.Though much of the book is heavy and raw, there is a silver lining and Debbie gets her happily ever after. The book serves as an inspiration for women who are currently in abusive relationships, giving them hope that they too can make it out and rebuild their lives. I am definitely going to pass this on to my girlfriends."}, {"userName": "Yin Chien \uc778\uccb8", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2944417-yin-chien", "userReview": "I didn't know what to expect when I started reading this book. But the first chapter already made me so sad and angry of what was happening to a nine-year-old Debbie. Her uncle raped her. And she was helpless, afraid and unable to do anything. If possible, I would jump into the book, slap her uncle, command him to stop his sinful act and save Debbie from the suffering, pain and hurt which accompanied her for a very long time. I was even heartbroken when I learned about Debbie's mother, who was also a rape victim. Worse still, the person who raped her mother was her grandfather. And he did that repeatedly. He even forced his young daughter into prostitution.This book is so haunting that you will keep thinking about the fearful events that occurred in Debbie and her mother's life which forced them into silence and self-destruction. I can almost feel their pain, conflicts and hurt throughout the book. Debbie's words are simple yet powerful because of the message that lies in it. I cried for her when she was in the abyss of darkness and despair. I felt elated when she finally found the strength and courage to cope the childhood trauma that was buried deep in her heart with the help of God and found her happiness at last.This book is a real motivational read. It tells us not to give up even thought the future seems bleak. It encourages us to stand up against the abuse and violence that is harboured upon us with bravery because only by doing so will we obtain peace at last. Everyone should read this book and learn about Debbie's journey. Stand will help many women in dealing with the harsh experiences in their lives and to stand up for themselves.

When I started, I literally couldn't drag myself away from it's pages. I read the first 12 chapters in one sitting (literally!) and finished the book within the next several hours. Yes, it was THAT good. It's heartbreaking. It's gruesome and gut-wrenching and brutal. The author does not shy away AT ALL from revealing any explicit details about the horrendous ordeals of child rape and molestation that happened to her, to her mom, and her grandma. If you don't have a strong stomach for this type of stuff, then you might have a very difficult time reading and processing the ugly details of this book. So many sections of it literally made me cry, the author was that honest.Being a Mental Health Counselor for kids who have been abused and neglected themselves, I've always taken an interest to brutally-honest memoirs such as these. It helps me take a peak into the life of these unfortunate victims: how they feel, think, grow, learn, and develop after experiencing some horrific acts from real-life monsters. The author does an amazing job expressing herself and what she went through and how she eventually overcome it all, and was able to move past the abuse and find a better life for herself and her children. She eventually found her fairy-tale ending. This book was inspiring, motivating, and absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend reading it!!"}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3456747-sandra", "userReview": "I won this book through Goodreads. It is signed by the author, & I love that. This isn't a book that I would normally have chosen for myself, so I am grateful to have won it. I enjoyed it a great deal. The author's story was not one I could relate to for the most part. Her description of her mother's childhood & her own were detailed, but not overly graphic. They were so well written, empathy came naturally.I teach young children, & I related to & found much of the childhood experiences familiar through my work. Fortunately, I was not a victim of childhood sexual abuse, but there were other aspects of the author's story that I could relate to easily. For instance, the love & worry for her children were very familiar emotions. Sadly, I could also relate to much of her feelings toward her mother. My point here is that even though the description may not sound like something you will relate to, you may very well find aspects that you find very familiar. I also understood much of her relationship with the husband who fathered her children because of my first husband :( A portion of the relationship with Gary reminded my of my current husband (I'm not implying I'll have another husband later- I can only bear so much - that is a slight joke). I encourage anyone to read this book. As I read it, I thought of several friends who I think will be benefit from reading this book, friends I hope can take courage from the author's courage."}, {"userName": "Kayleen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/981789-kayleen", "userReview": "This book is so great and powerful that I would like to share the first page with everyone.1Stolen Innocence1965Courage takes many forms. There is physical courage, there is moral courage. Then there is still a higher courage-the courage to brave pain, to live with it, to never let others know of it, and to still find joy in life; to wake up in the morning with an enthusiasm for the day ahead.- Howard Cosell.My sister, my cousin and I spent a hot summer day in the pool and were spending the night at our Uncle Sam's house. It was supposed to be another carefree day spent with family, celebrating the summer vacation. Instead, it was the day that my life started sliding down a steep and treacherous hill. That night, my twenty-two year old uncle walked into our room and told me that I was noisy and had to sleep in his room with him.Immediately, I got a sick feeling in my stomach, but at nine years old, I didn't know what it was, just that something was very wrong. With the innocence of a child who had been taught to obey my elders, I walked into his darkened bedroom and climbed into his bed. The sheets smelled like alcohol and I was very afraid.When he crawled in to bed next to me, I could feel his hairy leg on my skin. He was naked.

Ms. Williamson writes in a very readable,conversational style. I felt as if she was confiding in me.If there is any drawback, it's the excessive emphasis on the spiritual. I found my mind wandering during those parts. I had the same issue when I read Alice Sebold's THE LOVELY BONES.I did like the parts where she mentions her journal and talking to God.I always like it when authors use quotations at the beginning of the chapters. In Stand, the quotations gave a hint about the content of the chapter.Ms. Williamson's tenacity and determination not to let the cycle of abuse continue is truly inspirational. Although the abuse was bound to have some negative impact on her life,relationships,self-image, and psyche, she had the courage to seek aggressive treatment to confront her demons. This memoir could not have been easy to write but the end result must have been cathartic and I'm sure will help others struggling with abuse,whether physical,sexual,emotional, or verbal. Her memoir and speaking engagements is her way of giving back.
