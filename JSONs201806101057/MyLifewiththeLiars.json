There was too much extraneous matter and redundancy of thoughts in the MC's head that just wanted to make me scream, OKAY I GOT THAT ALREADY! Plus there were inconsistencies like the baby being almost two years old and two days later it says he is almost four years old. The MC uses the names of items she would not know like flip-flops and sequins. She has vivid memories of adult conversations she heard when she was two years old? Understanding adult vocabulary and situations? Also the bouncing back and forth between the current time and environment to the past, which at times I don't think was chronological, was confusing for me, even as an adult reader. At about the 60% mark the situations needed to bring the story to conclusion became ridiculous.

All she knows is Father Prophet, his teachings about Mother God, and the strict rules of her compounds. She endures periods of starvation and\"pinging\" (standing against a fence while the other kids throw rocks at her backs and legs) for the glorious day she turns 13. A week from her 13th birthday, Zylynn is taken away from the cult by a man who calls himself her father. She moves in with his wife and three kids, and is overwhelmed by the soft bed, the colorful clothes, and the refrigerator brimming with food. No one here is going to throw rocks at her for eating, or for asking questions. But will she be able to overcome what she's experienced?This is a middle grade book, and a brave one at that. Caela Carter writes about Zylynn and her cult with gentleness and honesty. It would easy to turn Zylynn into a caricature, but she's nuanced and three-dimensional. And her new family is so refreshingly solid. Her stepmother is a rock immediately, and while it takes a while for her to warm up to her father, he's also a good, albeit flawed man. Even if you're not a fan of MG books, I recommend you read this book."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710785-katie", "userReview": "[therapy and the possibility that it'll be a lifelong thing (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Mehsi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6720768-mehsi", "userReview": "When I heard about this book, and saw what it was about, I just knew I would read it. I have been interested in reading about cults, especially from the inside, or at least for the perspective of a character that is in one, or just got out one. The character from this book, named Zylynn, has been in a cult since she was born. So you can imagine that when, at age 12 almost 13, she is suddenly put outside of it, and dumped in the hands of her father, she is totally terrified, and fears that she will be in the darkness forever. That she won't have a chance at light, love, and God. That alone broke my heart. And as the book continues and we find out more and more about Zylynn, about the cult, about what happened there, my heart broke further. Poor Zylynn, poor people in there. Manipulated, and much much more. :( The book is written between the now and the then. We see Zylynn struggle with her new life, trying to escape so she can be at the ritual that will determine her future with the cult. She doesn't dare to speak, for fear for letting in the darkness. She stores food, she is wary of anyone not from her cult, she is even afraid of the food, thinking it will just be removed before she knows it, or that there is not enough in the end (seriously, that just pained me so much, to see such a small child be wary of food, wondering when it will leave, scrounging and keeping it hidden). And then there is the then. We learn about the cult, about days of hunger, about suspicious stuff happening, about the doctrine that is being stomped into the minds of the children, of the adults. We see rituals happen, we see happiness, and sadness. It took me a bit to get used to the format, it was clearly marked when we were going into the past, but it still was a bit jarring. I was just getting warmed up to the now, and then we would be brought to the past.As the book continues you can see a change in Zylynn, not a big one, she is still highly keen on escaping/running away, but you can see that she is more accepting of her circumstances, that she is becoming more happy. My heart broke for her though when she found out several things, and also near the end. Gosh, I cried. :(In the past you can also see a change. It becomes more and more clear that this cult is wrong, bad, not right. Sure, you could also see that from the get-go, but I feel that as the book progresses you see more wrongness seeping out.I loved the father, and I loved his wife (stepmother for Zylynn). They were so supportive, they tried so hard, they fought for Zylynn, and I was just cheering for them. They truly are amazing people. Their kids (and thus halfsiblings for Zylynn) were sweet and I loved how they accepted Zylynn, sure they were wary, but they did try to involve her with things. Especially the little girl.I also loved that other girl, a friend of Zylynn, she was really sweet and I loved her attitude. How even in the cult she never lost hope, and never stopped trying to do her own thing. The ending was sad, one filled with twists and turns (especially for Zylynn), but also one with hope for a good future. And I cried during several parts (not only sad tears, but also happy tears).This book will break your heart, this book will bring you to tears. This book is amazing, and I would highly recommend it to everyone.Review first posted at http://twirlingbookprincess.com/"}, {"userName": "Jenni Frencham", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6906412-jenni-frencham", "userReview": "Carter, Caela. My Life with the Liars. Harper Collins, 2016.Zylynn has always lived with the Children Inside the Light. She's eagerly anticipating her 13th birthday, less than two weeks away, when she is taken Outside and forced to live with her father and stepmother. She knows she can't trust a word they say - she's been told they are Liars - and she is determined to return to the compound before her very important 13th birthday, when she will go through the Ceremony and become an adult. But her father and stepmother's kindness is wearing down her walls. They let her eat as much as she wants and she gets to wear colors and have her own possessions. Will she be strong enough to return to the Light, or will she miss her Ceremony and live in Darkness forever?I love stories, real or imagined, about people who escape strict religious cults. This particular book is aimed more at a middle grade audience, and our protagonist is much younger than the typical 16-year old escapee from other books. She's confused because she only knows what she's been taught in the cult, so she does things like sleep with the lights on, hoard extra food under her bed, and refer to her parents by their first names. She doesn't know about wearing clothes with colors, or what an iPad is, or what it feels like to ride in a car. She tries desperately to return to the compound, to the things she finds familiar, but there's a pull in the novelty of things like strawberries, a room of one's one, and love. I love that this story is told from Zylynn's point of view. We see her confusion and struggle over living in this strange, new world. We see her desperation to return to the compound, and the love and patience of her family. When Zylynn hoards food, her stepmother puts it in containers for her, but leaves it under the bed where she had it, even though it is rotting. No one turns off her light at night while she sleeps because she is used to sleeping under bright lights. I read this book in one sitting, which is something I very rarely do. Recommended.Recommended for: middle grade, teens, fans of religious cult storiesRed Flags: kids in the cult are neglected and starved, they are punished with what I'll have to call \"mild stoning\" [yes, with rocks, but little ones],Overall Rating: 5/5 starsRead-Alikes: The Giver, Watch the Sky, Devoted, The Sacred Lies of Minnow Bly, A Good Courage"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2487858-amy", "userReview": "My 5-star rating is less for literary merit and more because it's hard to find a book that scratches that simple, short, fast-paced and yet creeptacular itch for upper middle grade literature. Think of MY LIFE WITH THE LIARS as a cross between immersive world-building dystopian books like The Giver and The City of Ember and the story of somebody adjusting to a new family like in One for the Murphys.Zylynn has grown up in a religious cult on a collective compound As the story begins, through some confusion that isn't fully revealed to the reader until the end, she is transplanted to the outside world with a strange family.Zylynn has been taught to believe that the outside world is filled with lies and Darkness, but slowly Zylynn begins to question exactly how Dark this outside world is, given that her host family has been able to feed her three meals a day and gives hugs to each other.Through flashback, it is revealed how abusive this religious cult is... we're talking starvation, stonings, and forced tranquilizers, as a start. Despite these flashbacks and the comforts of the outside world, Zylynn is determined to make it back to the compound so that she doesn't miss her all-important Ceremony for her thirteenth birthday.Adult readers won't find many plot surprises in this book, but younger readers may be amazed at some of the truths revealed along the way. Developing readers might have a hard time parsing the flashback scenes and understanding some of the conventions of the cult that aren't spelled out explicitly. Highly recommended for late sixth grade and above."}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1126715-tamara", "userReview": "Never dreamed of reading a kid's book about a religious cult...and I really liked it.

I had just read a few books that I really didn't love, but within the first few pages, I could tell My Life With the Liars was going to be different. Immediately I was captivated. This voice was unique, different not only because it's a Middle Grade novel but also because of the subject matter and just because of this compelling character of Zylynn.I'm not religious myself, but I'm so drawn towards books about cults and I think this book tackles that subject in such a unique and poignant way. Because this is told from the point of view of Zylynn, who has grown up within the cult and is now being taken out of the cult, we get to see her eyes open as she experiences the world in a way that sheds light on what we all take for granted. There are also flashbacks to her time in the cult, for readers like me who really want to see that aspect.I also really loved the fact that in so many movies, I've seen scenes where adults are trying to communicate with a child who has been hurt or abused in some way, and the child often won't speak or behaves in what seems like an erratic way. And when this happens, we usually see the adults' points of view: their exasperation, their passion for helping the child, their perseverance to get through to the child in some way, or their cry of defeat when they feel like their efforts are fruitless. Yet in My Life With the Liars, we see these scenes from Zylynn's point of view. We know why she hesitates when people try to communicate with her. We understand why she is extremely wary of the things she is given, and why she hoards food and is so protective of her belongings. We see the exasperation and the confusion in the faces of the adults around her, but we get her point of view, and it becomes more about her, and her troubles, and not about the adults and their efforts. I can't really explain how much I LOVED this aspect of My Life With the Liars.My Life With the Liars was an extremely compelling, quick moving story that kept me up reading for hours. I'm a super slow reader and I read it in one day. I'm also not a big crier and yet it turned on the waterworks. It was full of these interesting moral dilemmas and fascinating characters. So, in case you haven't figured it out yet, let me tell you my rating for My Life With the Liars by Caela Carter: 5 huge stars. I'll definitely have to check out some of Caela Carter's other books.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via Edelweiss, in exchange for my honest review.

Reading was not an option, for reading promoted inquiry, an opportunity to expand their minds and Father Prophet Rules prohibited this. Stay within the Light and your rewards will be great. Zylynn finds herself in the Darkness with Louis and knows she has only 10 days to return to the Light. She has heard stories of this Darkness and it chills her to out alone amongst it. It becomes her mission to return to her home in the Light. She feels that the less that she speaks the more she knows Father Prophet will be pleased with her. Louis claims to be father and inside this Darkness he says, she has a mother and siblings waiting for her but Father Prophet and Mother God have already claimed those titles for her. Zylynn\u2019s world was sheltered and closed-off inside the Light; Father Prophet controlled his flock of followers. Zylynn was told about the Darkness, how it was full of Liars and how the Light could not save them from their anguish. His followers knew that they must be inside the Light by their thirteenth birthday or they were doomed. Zylynn had ten days to find her way back to the Light before her birthday or she would forever be living in torture, forever living in terror, forever living in the Darkness with the Liars.I was hooked immediately upon reading the first chapter of this novel. It wasn\u2019t a horrendous or gruesome novel dealing with the cult; it dealt more with mind control. Zylnn was taken to Father Prophet\u2019s compound at small age, she knows no other life. When she enters the Darkness, she doesn\u2019t know how to interact in her new environment. Her whole life she has been governed by rules and now she has no direction and she feels lost and alone. I found myself screaming, \u201cGive her some rules! Give her boundaries!\u201d as she needs to feel safe and secure. I loved while she was emerging into her new environment and learning about it, her vocabulary words from the Light came into play. Inserting them into her new world, she attempted to comprehend what was occurring. As the days go by, she begins to enjoy some of \u201cdangers\u201d from the Darkness and I could feel the sway in Zylynn\u2019s tone. How can this be? All these years she was warned about the dangers and now living amongst them, she is finding some of them enjoyable and wondering if she could take some of them back with her to the Light. Zylynn thoughts turn to Jaycia, the girl who left the Light and didn\u2019t turn before her 13th birthday, will Zylynn be like her or will she get home to the Light and be safe before her birthday? What actually happened to Jaycia, for Zylynn misses her and loved her. I thought this novel was a great read before but now as I turned the page, this novel throws Zylynn into an emotional twister. Zylynn gets the answer to her question but it\u2019s not the answer that she wanted to hear. Sometimes though, that is how it is. I really wanted a different ending; I liked everything leading up to the conclusion but the ending itself, not so much."}, {"userName": "Kate Puleo Unger", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23343505-kate-puleo-unger", "userReview": "My Life with the Liars is a wonderful middle grade novel.

I loved this book!Zylynn was raised in a cult. Right before her 13th birthday her father breaks her out, but Zylynn doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s her father.

It\u2019s amazing to think about all of the things that Zylynn would not know being raised in a cult. I couldn\u2019t put this book down. It was just so fascinating. I love books dealing with extreme religion, but this book is by far the best that I have read.I was a little frustrated with her father and his wife because I didn\u2019t feel like they did a good job explaining anything to Zylynn. I can see why that was done. It would have made the book resolve too quickly if they had explained things, but as a mother it was hard to read about their poor parenting.Other than that one issue, this book was flawless. Middle grade fiction doesn\u2019t always appeal too me, but this book wasn\u2019t at all \u201cdumbed down.\u201d It\u2019s very intelligent and insightful.

Zylynn is days away from turning 13 and the ceremony that will test whether she is worthy of Mother God's love when her biological father appears to take her into the Darkness and away from the Children of the Light. Life outside the compound is confusing with lots of choices and few rules, and all Zylynn can think about is making it back to the compound in time for her ceremony. But as days pass and her new family begins to worm their way into her heart, will Zylynn choose to stay with the Liars or return to the only home she has ever known? Zylynn's reactions to a world that she has been taught is fundamentally evil are carefully balanced to show her naivete without ignoring her age and her realistically teenage confidence in right vs. wrong. The plot moves quickly, with frequent flashbacks to her life in the compound, and Carter does a nice job of making both narrative strands engaging, parceling out details slowly to keep readers intrigued. The resolution is satisfying and empowering for Zylynn, allowing her to reach a point of understanding and a place where she can begin to ask the questions she has been suppressing for so long. That said, Carter never really delves below the surface - characters are pretty much as they appear, and larger questions about faith and the culture of consumption are never addressed with any complexity. Still, the intriguing premise should make it a good candidate for booktalks, and most young readers will enjoy the ride."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12349233-tracy", "userReview": "I loved this one.
