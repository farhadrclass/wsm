I\u2019d just finished my 3rd, her latest book, and wanted more by her. 4 1/2 starsIt was published in 2014 but I kept thinking how it felt as though it could have been published right now or a few years from now. At 2017-2016 California leaving the country seems even more current than it did a few years ago. It might be no more likely but the discussion about it is definitely more common since Election Day last November. As is usual for this author the book has interesting, relatable characters easy to care about, and stellar storytelling, and perfection when it comes to describing San Francisco and particularly the Richmond District in San Francisco. (I\u2019ve spent almost all of my adult years in 2 dwellings in different parts of the Richmond District so I know it well and I get a kick out of reading about it, and I\u2019ve lived in San Francisco most of my years and appreciate reading about all neighborhoods/places this author mentions.)Even though I live nearby and have known people directly connected with the V.A. campus, I wasn\u2019t sure about some of the details described regarding it. As I was reading I wondered about the school and hotel described. In the interview section that comes at the end of the book the author confirmed the existence of the school and I researched the nearby hotels and found a hoptel that fits, and I suppose other places might also fit. I wish that more book authors got San Francisco right. This author has for the 4 books by her that I\u2019ve read so far and for me it contributes to the joy I feel when reading them. I especially appreciated how in addition to the San Francisco setting, the author\u2019s southern roots and some locations are included in this story. I got a good sense of both locales. I thoroughly enjoyed the back and forth time lines. I thought that this technique worked particularly well for this story.I appreciated how much is tied up at the end and also how a couple of main things are left open and left to readers\u2019 imaginations. \u00bd star off because so much is going on: the marriage story, the sister story, the child story, the California secession vote story, the hostage story. I\u2019m not 100% sure all of them were needed, though I admit the whole thing did work, beautifully really. I just wanted a tad more of each part. At the end of my paperback edition there is a short but enlightening interview with the author, a playlist for the book, and a list of questions for discussion. They\u2019re all interesting and worthy inclusions. This author\u2019s books are always quotable. Two quotes (of many) from this one that resonated with me are: \u201cWe tend to see life as a continuum, but really, it's a series of phases, generating a series of different selves. You leave one life behind and start another. And each time, a different version of yourself emerges.\u201d AND \u201cHistory is made not of facts set in stone but of the stories we tell.\u201d I have to say something not about the book proper but about the cover of my edition, sans any spoilers. In the text of one of the mini-reviews that are included, one by an author whose books I enjoy, while no plot specifics are mentioned a feeling word is mentioned when referring to the end of the book, and that\u2019s something I did not want to know and I consider it a spoiler. My gripe is with the edition publisher for including it/not editing out that word. It\u2019s too much information for text that\u2019s often read before readers read the book. When I got to the end of the book I realized that reading it was not as much of a spoiler issue as I\u2019d feared but I still think it would have been best for it not to have been there."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "\"What I believe is this: there is no divine flow chart, no elegant spiritual mathematics through which our lives are processed. Events occur, we respond to them, we make choices, and our lives are shaped accordingly.\"Julie Walker's life has been shaped by many different events. Her father died when she was young; her mother raised Julie and her younger sister, Heather, in a small, stifling Mississippi town which Julie couldn't wait to leave. When Julie left for medical school in San Francisco, she felt bad about leaving her needy sister, but she needed to reinvent herself and start her future. Heather drifted from boyfriend to boyfriend, place to place, problem to problem, and came in and out of Julie's life.Julie met Tom, a radio disc jockey, and the two fell deeply in love. And when an unexpected incident surprises them and transforms their lives, they are truly happy. Until Heather re-enters their lives, and everything falls apart in her wake, including, little by little, Julie and Tom's marriage. Heather leaves to join the Army, and the two sisters stop speaking completely for several years.\"I understand now how families become estranged, not by design but by embarrassment. You come to a point when so much time has passed that it seems impossible to make the first move.\"Heather's return throws Julie into upheaval once again, and wreaks havoc with what is left of her relationship with Tom, especially once Heather reveals her pregnancy. Yet Julie agrees to deliver Heather's baby, and the day she goes into labor turns out to be one fraught with chaos\u2014for Julie, for the possibility of a future with Tom, for the entire state of California. Julie faces a shocking crisis which forces her to re-evaluate everything in her life, including her relationships.Golden State is tremendously compelling, thought-provoking, emotional, and very engaging. Michelle Richmond hooks you quite quickly into Julie's life and the crises she faces, as the book follows the course of one day, with occasional reminiscences of other times in Julie's life. It's a fascinating exploration about the ties and the loyalties of our relationships, those we're born into and those we choose.\"Between a marriage one chooses and a blood relation one doesn't, shouldn't marriage be the more powerful bond?\"I enjoyed Golden State a great deal. I really liked the complexity of both Julie and Tom's characters, compelled both by what has happened and what remains unsaid. I'll admit, however, while the major incident that drives much of the plot and forces Julie to reminisce certainly is a driver of the story, I felt as if it was almost superfluous; I thought Julie's story and her relationships with her sister and her husband could have stood on their own. But it didn't detract from the power of the story.If you see any of the reviews or publicity around this book, it's recommended for fans of Jodi Picoult or Jacquelyn Mitchard. I worried a little bit that this book would be one of the ripped-from-the-headlines-type stories Picoult is well known for, but fortunately (in my opinion), this wasn't that way at all. It's just a well-written and well-told story that definitely makes you think how you'd react in similar situations."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "3.5. I found this book intriguing. There is so much going on over the course of one day: Dr. Julie Walker has just signed her divorce decree, the vote for the succession of California is taking place, her jeep windows have been broken, her sister is in labor and she is to deliver her baby, she has broken her foot and a friend who always wanted to be more than a friend, a vet suffering from post traumatic stress is holed up in her office and is holding three of her fellow workers hostage. All this going on should make this novel unrealistic, it should not work, yet it does. It should be full of hold on to your seats suspense, but rather than this, the author uses these scenarios to investigate the choices we make in life. An amazing in depth character study.During this very long day, Dr. Walker examines her life, the choices she has made, that has led her here from there. How in a moment, one decision and our lives can change, our path forward taking a detour.

I devoured it in hours. I absolutely loved it. I rushed out, purchased multiple copies and sent them out in the mail to the only readers I knew at the time. I then proceeded to read her other works. Sadly, that's been over 7 years ago! I've never forgotten how much I enjoyed TYotF and I often browse looking for a new release from Richmond. I joined up for her newsletter via her website and heard very little. Then FINALLY!!! I got an email that said she had a new book coming out! I quickly checked my ARC websites and saw the book in both NetGalley and Edelweiss....I quickly applied to both sites to snag my copy...and surprisingly enough I was approved by both websites. I can't remember being so excited about a book for a while now. It wasn't soon that I was completely worn out from hooting and hollering and dancing around the house from all of my excitement. Suddenly, as I sat down to catch my breath, I was dejected. I had waited so long for this book to be written, now it was here...what if I hate it? What if the love I felt for TYotF was just a fluke? What if I am so disappointed in this novel that it even takes away from my previous feelings of obsession to getting to my next Michelle Richmond read? What if the writing is so awful that I start to doubt what I felt in the past? I was torn....to start the book or to stare at it's cover for a time and just imagine what might be between the covers?Heck!!!!!!! You guys know me, RIGHT???????? I ripped into this baby so fast!!!!! I couldn't wait to start it! Was I disappointed? Heck no!!!!!! It's a Michelle Richmond novel! I absolutely loved it from start to finish! I think I might have loved it even a bit more than TYotF....This novel is a day in the life of Doctor Julie Walker. Of course, it's no ordinary day. California is in the midst of a game changing election day. Her sister needs her help pronto. Her Jeep is broken into. And two men in her life are not where she needs them to be. And this ladies and gentlemen is only the beginning....Now let me forthright and honest here for just a moment....I wish there was a bit more to the ending...that Richmond had taken it just a little bit further...I wanted to see just a smiden more of the side story of the novel (and for sake of spoilers, that's all I will say on that subject)Also, it needs pointed out that Richmond has a unique writing style. She doesn't blurt out the plots. They are just there...yes, you sort of know what they are, but at the same time, you're not 100% sure. All the while, Richmond drops bread crumbs along the trail and confirms her story or throws in a small twist that has you wondering....At the same time, she jumps back and forth. It can be frustrating if you want things laid out in a straight path to follow. One moment, the main character is in the present, the next second she is 3 hours earlier or a decade earlier. The only way you have to follow is to simply LISTEN to thoughts of the main character. Soon enough, if you just relax, you can follow along just fine.I was sitting there after I finished the book, pondering it all (did I mention I LOVED the book?) and I realised, really, think about it, isn't that how we really are? We jump from the present to what we had for breakfast this morning...and then a moment later a song, or a smell, or for some reason we don't even know, think back to a time in our past. To a memory. Pondering how we got to this place in time. Memories are a great tool. They help us live our current lives and they help shape our futures as well. Memories are not just something that we leave behind and forget. We never know when they are going to hit us. I think that is why I love Richmond so much. She has a way of writing that I really feel like I can connect with the character. I am there with them, confronting the memories. Dealing with their guilt. Or their anger. Or their confusion. I am there feeling them realise their imperfections. Accepting their blame. I am the one trying to find forgiveness. I am the one who is trying to change for the better. I can't recommend this book enough. I really can't. I won't say that it's perfect format for writing. I won't say this is a literary gem that will challenge all the writings throughout time. But I will say, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT YOU HOLD HOLY, DO NOT MAKE ME WAIT ANOTHER 7 YEARS FOR THE NEXT BOOK, MICHELLE RICHMOND!!!!Bwhahahahahahaahahahaha....go get this book!!!! As fast as you can! Still not convinced? Maybe a few quotes will do for you...\"I understand how families become estranged, not by design, but by embarrassment.

This was a definite page-turner. It\u2019s the sort of book that presents the \u201calmost-end\u201d of the story first and then works its way back. So the story jumps from present time, to earlier in that same day. And actually includes a lot of back stories to understand how the characters got to the point they are. I had so many questions as the book started; what is going on? who is Ethan? what did Heather do? Who is Dennis? and what happened to him? And the book answers all of them, in time.The main character is Dr. Julie Walker and she begins the book with her pregnant, in labor, sister Heather. If that\u2019s not enough drama, throw in protests throughout the city of San Francisco and a hostage situation. And on top of all of that many little mysteries (or rather facts not yet revealed) the author includes to keep those pages turning.The protests shutting down the city throughout the day revolve around the possible succession of California from the United States. An interesting premise and as the story began, I thought there would be more political discussion on this topic. But there was just enough for me, as that is not always a huge interest to me (and I also worry about getting turned off by extreme political views.)I also enjoyed that Julie\u2019s (soon-to-be-ex) husband, Tom, is a radio show host and certain songs he plays are almost the soundtrack to the book, and most of them spur memories for Julie which continue to build her character throughout the book. While we actually never meet Tom in the book, he is easily pictured through Julie\u2019s memories and descriptions of him.So much packed into this book, I feel I could go on about all the characters you meet and what you learn from them, but you\u2019ll just have to read it! Lastly, I loved the overall message. (I can\u2019t quote the book because this is an advance copy) But basically we shouldn\u2019t let our past define us, but we must always carry it with us and let it help who we will be moving forward. Julie came from a rough background and even after she overcame that, still had some bad stuff happen to her. She could choose to let it consume her and carry those raw emotions, but life is too short and precious and she learns that need to move forward.Great book \u2013 check it out in February!http://mydogearedpurpose.com/2013/11/..."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234533-amber", "userReview": "Thank you Bantam Books for an \"advance uncorrected proof\" of this book.Golden State is a novel set in San Francisco. It is about a woman named Julie and it takes place when Californians are voting whether or not California should secede from the United States. Julie is also involved in a hostage crisis. The book takes place over one day, but memories from Julie's past are strewn across the book so that the reader can understand her story and why she is in her current situation. Julie is a doctor and on this day she is in a hurry to a medical crisis. She has to get to Heather (and we slowly find out why) and many obstacles stand in her way especially because of all the street commotion due to the voting. To me, the maybe or maybe not separation of California from the States and the hostage situation are secondary to Julie's story. Her relationships with those closest to her are what this book is about. This book is about how people make certain choices to change their lives for the better, but how sometimes bad things happen in the end and we just have to make things work the best we know how. My favorite character in the book was Tom, the radio DJ. I enjoyed how Tom and Julie's past were revealed by her memories through his music choices that she heard over the radio. I also enjoyed the mystery behind Ethan. I don't think the book needed the California seceding part, except that it was foreshadowing to things in Julie's life being broken.This was a good book. Richmond is a good writer and she knew how to end this book properly. How to sum it up in a beautiful way. The story also had twists that kept me turning the pages. There was also great character development when it came to Julie and Heather.

Richmond brilliantly brings Julie to life, slowly sharing her past and each hour of this single day leading up to the crisis point. I love her use of time in this novel.She also goes deeper than a great character study, to investigate the ways we as individuals and as societies deal with change.\"We understand the possibility of change up to a point.

A new life is coming into the world, being born into chaos within chaos. An injured doctor and laboring mother are holed up inside a hospital hotel room with furniture pushed up against the doors and windows barricaded. Outside, a disgruntled civilian is holding people hostage in the VA hospital and help is nowhere to be found. The police are elsewhere and a hostage situation is nothing when California itself is in a complete political upheaval with state succession looming in the distance. With the vote to leave the union occurring that very day, the riots and uprisings have taken their toll on law enforcement availability.For every minute that occurs during the hospital standoff, the author brings us back in time through the eyes of Dr. Julie Walker. We witness all of her lifetime achievements and losses, from marriage to the loss of a child, from budding romance to extra-marital affairs, from love to anger and resentment. Everything builds up to this one day, dictating how she handles the events that unfold.A Mississippi transplant, Julie often comments on the earthquakes in California - comparing the quakes to things that can shake up your life.

It's set against a backdrop of a city under siege - California is voting to secede, it's election day, and people are rioting. There's also a gunman holed up at the VA hospital with three hostages, and the main character's sister is across the street in labor. The main character, Julie, is injured and trying desperately to get to her sister without stepping into the line of fire.This seems like a pretty exciting beginning, right? Well, as it turns out, that's as exciting as it gets. Julie's injury has nothing to do with the siege nor the guman - she stepped off the curb wrong. It also isn't clear how the gunman and the secession vote are related - maybe the gunman just chose that day because of all the chaos?This book is full of good starts with disappointing payoffs. Another thread woven throughout is the reason for Julie's estrangement from her sister, and how that is related to the loss of Julie's child, but the explanation was disappointing. It's more about introspection - Julie recalls the events in her life since she moved to CA which led her, and her new state, to this moment. It's not really about the action of the riots, the election, or even the gunman.Still, I gave it three stars because I liked some of the insights Julie had about marriage and family, and because it was a super quick read.

I was intrigued by the idea of the secession of California from the US, and its metaphorical significance to a crumbling marriage. (i also liked exploring the back story of the protagonist, VA Hospital physician Julie Walker, whose path from Mississippi to the Golden State was kinda the polar opposite of my own bailing out of California to come to the South ten years ago, at the height of the state's {and my own personal} woes.). Ms. Richmond (and the novel) is best when dissecting Dr. Walker's marriage with an alt-rock DJ, Tom. The book stumbles a bit, in Picoultian fashion, when Ms. Richmond takes two plot threads (one good: Dr. Walker's relationship with her wayward younger sister; and one somewhat befuddling: Dr. Walker's relationship with a ex-GI who goes off the deep end) and wrings them for every ounce of drama she possibly can.Overall, this was a solid read.

The politics of secession serve merely as a backdrop for a town in chaos, setting up Julie's long trek to the hospital due to chaos in the streets. GOLDEN STATE focuses on Julie and her relationships to her hapless mother, her unreliable sister who took away the most important person in Julie's life, her husband whom she still loves dearly.Richmond skipped around from past to present to earlier in the day, sometimes confusing me. Some of the backstory felt unnecessary, although the pace remained steady. GOLDEN STATE is very readable, I devoured it in one sitting with a food break. The ending felt more open ended than satisfactory. I would have loved an epilogue."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6053755-audrey", "userReview": "As with Richmond's latest book (\"The Marriage Pact\"), \"Golden State\" has family relationships at its core, specifically a husband and wife and two sisters. Richmond masterfully draws these characters and their relationships and sets them in an imagined future (the book was published in 2014) when California is voting on whether to break away from the U.S. Against this dramatic political backdrop--the book actually takes place mostly on a single day during which opposing factions are out on the streets--Dr. Julie Walker must cross San Francisco on foot to help deliver her sister's baby. Richmond is a master at creating a vivid sense of place, whether it's San Francisco or Dr. Walker's native Mississippi. I liked the way Richmond unfolded the story through the events of the day interspersed with memories of Dr. Walker's childhood, early life with her sister, and her marriage. The plot pieces all fit together--not in a predictable way, but in a way that felt inevitable and tied to the characters' motivations. And she dives into current events and larger cultural issues without losing sight of the individual stories.There were a few spots, notably the end, where I would have preferred less wrapping up, but overall the book was a compelling, fast read with a situation that will leave you thinking about it long after your done."}, {"userName": "Ann Waimiri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52894190-ann-waimiri", "userReview": "...I kept googling about the state of government in California because for a moment i thought they had seceded right under my nose :D :D that's how dramatic the novel is.

However, I did go back and re-read the beginning after I was about a third of the way through to understand the characters a bit better. Although written before the 2016 political events, it could easily have been written today; the book takes place in San Francisco on the day its residents are set to vote on secession amid ultra conservative Washington politics. Four stars instead of five because there was almost too much going on in the book. There is the \"main\" plot line which leads to the shattering suspenseful climax but there are also so many subplots and character interactions including sibling relationships, a crumbling marriage. There was a lot of buildup to what Julie's sister did to fracture their relationship but the book was 75% done before it was finally revealed what she actually did. The relationships are complex and well written, however, and resolved (mostly) by the end of the book. \"There is a simple truth, and it is this: somehow we must move forward, always carrying with us who we are, always looking forward to who we might be.\""}, {"userName": "Laurel-Rain", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1402123-laurel-rain", "userReview": "Julie Walker's escape from her childhood home in Mississippi to a new life in California was a way to put her troubles behind her. Leaving her younger sister Heather, with her many issues, was a part of that process.Now, years later, with a career as a doctor and a husband who is a radio personality, Julie has everything she wants. Except for two things: The family she lost one day because of one irresponsible night and Heather's unforgivable mistakes, and a marriage that seems irrevocably broken.But Heather is back in San Francisco hoping for another chance, and pregnant with her own child. And on a day that might change everything for Californians\u2014a vote to decide if the state secedes from the U.S.\u2014Heather is in labor, Julie and her staff have been taken hostage, and Julie ponders the steps that have brought her here to this pivotal moment.Narrated by Julie, \"Golden State: A Novel\" focuses on the one day, but also sweeps back and forth between the past and the present, bringing us the bits and pieces that form the whole tale. And as we move closer to the final denouement, we must ask ourselves: What will happen by the end of the day...with the vote, the hostage situation, and Heather's quest for forgiveness?Heather was a difficult character to like. I wanted to throw things at her because of her freewheeling lifestyle\u2014a metaphor for how outsiders perceive California?\u2014and for her inability to tell the truth or accept the consequences of her actions.Julie was definitely the more likeable character, but she, too, had her flaws.A fast paced book, this one was appealing to me, a native Californian, as I moved quickly to the conclusion while invariably asking myself if something like this could actually happen? Could the state secede? And, on the other hand, can a broken family find healing?

On the day that California is voting to possibly secede from the U.S., Julie is finalizing a divorce, breaks her ankle and has to walk on it across the city to deliver her sister's baby and also contend with a hostage situation. The story of her estrangement from her sister and how her marriage fell apart are told in flashbacks. Because of the various story lines that are intertwined, the flashback format and the short chapters, this book can be described as a page turner. The author gives only tidbits of each of the story lines and switches among them so that the reader is compelled to keep reading to discover more of the back story. The character development of Julie and her husband Tom is central to the novel and struck me the most. The author also describes the closeness of the sisters in childhood and the later estrangement in a way that touched me. Overall, this was an enjoyable read. The hostage situation, however, was not particularly suspenseful or even necessary in my opinion. The vote regarding California succession also did not seem necessary or important. The story of Julie's childhood, her ambition and drive to become a doctor, her relationships with Tom and her younger sister make this novel worth reading. I gave it three stars because of the distracting story lines of the hostages and the election."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3049657-victoria", "userReview": "About five years ago, I recall reading and enjoying Richmond\u2019s debut novel, The Year of Fog. It may have strained my credulity a bit, but I remember it was fast paced and so I was curious to read this one, her most recent novel. Though chronologically speaking, the bulk of the book takes place over the course of one fateful day, the novel covers much more of the characters\u2019 lives than that. Richmond uses the secession of California from the union as a larger metaphor to reflect the separation of Dr. Julie to her disc jockey husband, Tom. The politics are for the most part, the secondary part of the novel. It is a sad novel, though, with hints of greater tragedies to come as the book continues on through the story of Julie and Tom\u2019s courtship and marriage. Richmond manages to throw in some surprises through the flashbacks. It\u2019s a well-constructed novel, but by the last page, I felt a bit cheated. It ends in a completely unsatisfying way. The reader isn\u2019t given anything satisfying in regards to either the political turmoil or the relationships at the heart of the novel. It feels unfinished and incomplete. It really is a shame, because up until those last few pages, I had really been enjoying this one..."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15138024-erin", "userReview": "Julie Walker is a doctor who is going through a divorce and is on her way to help her sister deliver her baby.

I love how the book takes place in one day, and how the author gives the reader flashbacks that all come together in the end, leading you to where Julie is now. Julie is a very strong and independent woman who tends to rely on herself, but as the book progresses, she begins to learn that she needs the people who she has pushed away in the past. Julie is on a path to self discovery, all while learning the meaning of loss, and love. The author made it easy to connect with the main character. I was glued pages for the last third of the book.
