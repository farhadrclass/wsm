I am a huge Roxane Gay fan and I love her short fiction nearly as much as her non-fiction. This collection of short stories showcasts Gay\u2019s tremendous talent and her brilliant voice. While this cannot quite reach the highs of her second collection (very few things do), I still adored this.Gay\u2019s stories center around pain. There is no way around that. These stories are grim and dark and very depressing. But she also, always, adds some hope, some light, and does so expertly and brilliantly.There was not a single story in this collection that I didn\u2019t like, which is very rare for me when it comes to short story collections. I do admit to finding the collection overwhelming in parts because of the grim subject matter and had to take frequent breaks after particularly grueling stories \u2013 but never for long because Roxane Gay has a very distinct, very brilliant voice and I cannot imagine a world where I won\u2019t read every single thing she produces. Her observations are sharp and her thoughts on identity and pain and family and loyalty and living are important and necessary and so very very brilliant (I cannot help but speak in superlatives; after all Roxane Gay is one of my very favourite authors).I received an arc of this book courtesy of NetGalley and Grove Atlantic in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23315273-carol", "userReview": "Ayiti is Roxanne Gay\u2019s debut short story collection. The pages are few. The impact large. Each story flows into the next, although they are unrelated to one another with the exception of the overriding theme of Haiti, as a nation, a place of origin, a place with a complex history \u2013 one that grounds those who leave and often presents difficulties to those who stay.

Ayiti is a slim collection of short of stories, that appears to have been first published a few years ago. The stories are all focused on characters in Haiti or characters from Haiti, which is where Gay\u2019s own family comes from. There are a few longer stories, and many very short snippets. There is one story in particular that I really liked that I gather formed the basis for her novel An Untamed State. It would be hard to say that this is a loving portrait of Haiti. There is plenty of brutality. But Gay is clearly determined to make sure her readers understand that Haiti is more than the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, and she succeeds. Strong writing and powerful characters make this one well worth reading.

This short story collection contains 15 texts of varying length that all deal with Haiti and its people. In the acknowledgements, the author states: \"I write about Haiti and the Haitian American experience from a place of great privilege but also a place of great pride\" - and this pride shows in the texts themselves. Gay's stories radiate love for the country, its culture and the Haitian people, and the emotional impact derives from the empathy the reader cannot help but feel when reading about the joy and pain the characters experience. What struck me the most is how Gay writes about the attachment people feel to their home and the longing for a better life somewhere else (in these cases: The U.S.). How must it feel to live in a country that others declare to be defined by its poverty? In a text that was obviously written when for some time not Haiti, but Nicaragua was the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Gay adresses Nicaraguans: \"You will hear these words until you are sick to your stomach, until you no longer recognize su tierra, until you start to believe the news stories are true, that nothing else matters, that sie no puedes comprar cosas que no necesitas, tu no existes, tu no cuentas, tu no mereces respeto.\"(Currently, Haiti is again the poorest country in the Western hemisphere and has to deal with the destructive power of this label.) There are also wonderful texts about the Haitian immigrant experience, what it means to leave and how it feels to be perceived as a foreigner:\"For many years, we didn't realize our parents had accents, that their voices sounded different to unkind American ears. All we heard was home. Then the world intruded. It always does.\"Full disclosure: I am generally not very knowledgeable about Haiti, but Gay gave me a sense of what this country is all about. I read the whole book in one setting and was basically glued to my kindle. So mission accomplished and thank you, Roxane Gay!"}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56491386-kirsty", "userReview": "I have heard nothing but praise for Roxane Gay, and this collection of tales set entirely in Haiti - 'a place run through with pain' - really appealed to me. Ayiti is accurately described in its blurb as 'a powerful collection exploring the Haitian diaspora experience'. Some of the stories included are little more than vignettes, or fragments of tales, examining one or two elements of the migrant experience, and covering just a couple of pages. Others are much longer, and have a lot of depth to them.Gay's prose has a sensual vivacity to it. The second story, 'About My Father's Accent', for example, begins: 'He knows it's there. He knows it's thick, thicker even than my mother's. He's been on American soil for nearly thirty years, but his voice sounds like Port-au-Prince, the crowded streets, the blaring horns, the smell of grilled meat and roasting corn, the heat, thick and still.'Many themes are touched upon and tackled here. Gay writes about racism, misconceptions about the Haitian culture, superstition, medicine, tradition, sex and sexuality, violence, crime, the changing face of Haiti over time, and the family unit. The stories in Ayiti are emotive and thought-provoking; every single story, no matter its length, is memorable, and there is a real power to the collection."}, {"userName": "Didi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682140-didi", "userReview": "Having read but one short collection this entire year, I'm ending 2014 with a really good one.

Ayiti by Roxane Gay is an exceptional collection of short stories that speaks to Haiti. I am amazed that this is a debut novel, but then again, why? Roxane Gay is a master author so I should expect her debut to be flawless. We don't read a lot about Haiti and Haitians, and when we do it is hardly from someone who is intimate with the country's culture and practices. I am happy Gay chose this was her first collection this is required reading- especially if you are a Caribbean national.

Whether a language is shared or a language divides, what it offers, when spoken with strength and authority, is an opportunity to share the truth. There is a connection to the desire for truth from the title of the book, which is the Haitian Creole for Haiti, to the final words, which are about more than language. The final words are about that which is beyond language. That which we all share: a desire for love, a release from fear, a necessary need for freedom.Each of the stories within this book is a slice of heartache and of truth, but the one that struck me most was the one at the very heart of the book--both its physical center and its spiritual center--and that is, \"In the Manner of Water or Light.\" From the very first words, I was swept into a dark, puzzling, and beautiful world:My mother was conceived in what would ever be known as the Massacre River. The sharp smell of blood has followed her since.The Massacre River is both the taker and giver of life. It offers a baptism in blood. And as important as the river is to the players in the story, it is also the keeper of their secrets:The ugly details are trapped between the fragments of our family history. We are secrets ourselves.Indeed, \"we are secrets ourselves\" is at the core of the stories within these books. It is as if each is a confession whispered into a deaf ear, or, conversely, a secret bursting forth, no longer able to be contained, screamed loudly from the tallest mountain, \"You will hear me!\" These are secrets that need telling. It is in telling and sharing the secrets that people are set free:I had pictured the river as a wide, yawning and bloody beast, but where we stood, the river flowed weakly. The waters did not run deep. It was just a border between two geographies of grief.If you had never read anything else Roxane Gay had written, you would certainly know from these stories that she is a truth teller, which she is. She does not hide her face or turn away from that which people do not want told. Ayiti is a brave and beautiful book, filled with truths that need to be told. Read it."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16610521-brooke", "userReview": "This is my first Roxanne Gay book and I can understand why her books are so popular.

We are secrets ourselves. We try to protect each other from the geography of so much sorrow. I don't know that we succeed.\u201d\nSweaty! Sticky! Airless! Humid! \nAyiti\n exudes uncomfortably clammy adjectives \u2013 though one senses no single word could ever adequately describe the insufferable sultriness of a typical Haitian day without even a small electric fan to stir the fug.Haiti became the world's first black-led republic and independent Caribbean state after first abolishing slavery and then ousting its French colonizers in the early 19th century. Situated on the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with the Dominican Republic, this land of sugarcane plantations and colourful shantytowns is one of the poorest in the Americas; and since 1957, when Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier (known to his people as 'Papa Doc') became President, the Haitians have endured one reign of terror, catastrophic Act of God and degrading ordeal after another. The beleaguered island is also famous for voodoo (or Vodou, in Haitian Creole) \u2013 a religious cult combining elements of Roman Catholic ritual with traditional African magical rites. These beliefs were used by the Duvalier dynasty and the much feared Tontons Macoutes (members of a paramilitary force masquerading as 'Bogeymen') to subjugate the population. Following an earthquake in 2010, many locals believed that vodouists were responsible for the natural disaster (and a subsequent Cholera epidemic), which led to Vodou priests being lynched.Professor Roxane Gay was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1974, at a time when Duvalier's playboy son, Jean-Claude (or 'Baby Doc') had succeeded his late father and was leading the country into a fresh cycle of torture, killings and financial ruin. Her family is of Haitian descent, but she has always acknowledged her \u201cprivileged background\u201d compared to others (though she could hardly be said to have 'had it easy') \u2013 but her circumstances have never prevented her from exploring the Haitian condition in her writing. She is now a successful author and cultural critic who teaches English at Purdue University.I have followed Gay's columns in The Guardian since about 2014, delighting in her astute observations on topics as wide ranging as the Oscar Pistorius case, living in Florida, being overweight and Valentine's Day. She is the author of the critically admired essay collection Bad Feminist (2014), the novel An Untamed State (2014), the short story collection Difficult Women (2017) and a memoir entitled Hunger (2017).\nAyiti\n was Gay's debut collection \u2013 a blend of fiction, poetry and personal memories concerning the \u201cHaitian diaspora experience\u201d \u2013 originally published by a small press in 2011, but now reissued with additional content by Grove Press. Some of her compositions are short and punchy but, for me, the really powerful pieces, are the lengthier and more fully developed stories like Sweet on the Tongue (about the trauma of kidnap and gang rape) and Of Ghosts and Shadows (on the closeted life of a lesbian couple).The most potent parts of this collection are those which explore the quotidian: the lives of individuals, either on the island or exiled to somewhere like 'Little Haiti', as they survive each hot, hungry, difficult day \u2013 frequently exhausted, sometimes frightened \u2013 and through sheer strength of character, keep going.Gay's work is remarkable. We badly need writers of her calibre in the modern world. I keenly await publication of her new collection, Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture.Many thanks to Grove Press for providing an advance review copy of this title."}, {"userName": "Krystal", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22467330-krystal", "userReview": "This powerful debut collection of stories illuminate Roxane Gay's brilliance in her masterful ability to weave different narratives with humour and insightful depth at every imaginable turn!"}, {"userName": "Rachel Aloise", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21277858-rachel-aloise", "userReview": "Ayiti is a completely gripping collection of short, sharp, genre-defying writings.

It\u2019s a collection of short stories set in Haiti, or with Haitian characters. It evokes Haiti as a place of both beauty and struggle, the sun and the salt of the sea and the stench of blood. The inevitability of kidnap, of beggars, of hunger, of a need to leave. The stories are sensual, some sexual; packed with feeling and meaning.It\u2019s such a small collection that I feel like all I can remember of it is a cluster of sense-memories: sweat, sugar, blood.

It was originally released in 2011. However, this edition will be more widely available, and includes several new stories.Since I did not read the initial release, all of these were new to me, and I found that I was most drawn to three stories: Cheap, Fast, Filling, In The Manner of Water or Light, and The Dirt We Do Not Eat.Cheap, Fast, and Filling focuses on Lucien. A man who made it into America via an illegal border crossing. His cousin, who'd made his way to Miami years earlier, hands him $50 and tells him to eat Hot Pockets, to sustain himself, because they're \"cheap, filling, and taste good\".\u00a0The immigrant experience is often a reminder of the concept that the \"American Dream\" is still alive, albeit briefly, for those who have yet to become jaded by the systemic truths of this country, and have come from a place where even the opportunity for success is few and far between.\u00a0Even though Lucien's life is likely no better here, than it was in Haiti--where his wife and children await his call--he still finds a way to hold on to the hope that one day he'll be able to bring them to this land of plenty.The dream remains, despite evidence that it may not in fact exist.The Dirt We Do Not Eat\u00a0is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the egotism of Americans: we believe what we're told about poorer nations because we're sold the idea that the American way of life is better than any other. And, because we buy into that notion,\u00a0we are quick to assume any nation, not built upon our democratic ideals, is languishing.Gay weaves each tale without spectacle.There isn't a bunch of flowery language, nor do the stories seem to go on longer than necessary--most of them are so brief you'll almost forget you read them--but each leaves you wanting a bit more because you don't get to know the outcome. So, you find yourself wondering what happens to Lucien, and how that married couple on the boat fared in their attempt to escape their homeland, and whether or how Marise adjusted to life after Carlos.\u00a0You're offered a glimpse, but that is all. And although the stories are fictional, the experiences are not, so you're left to wonder about the outcomes. Left to ponder the origins and injustices each raises. Left wanting\u00a0 a bit more ...closure, maybe?Then again, perhaps that was part of the plan."}, {"userName": "Jamise // Spines & Vines", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13111928-jamise-spines-vines", "userReview": "Review pending"}, {"userName": "Nadine", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3759963-nadine", "userReview": "Ayiti is a short story collection about Haiti and the people who call it home.Gay excels at creating and crafting compelling and dynamic characters in so few pages.

This little book is the best example of short short stories that spend little time building and instead they actually spend time moving rhythmically and sensually with a poetic prose that embodies the soul and voice of her Haitian background. You can feel the heat, the graze of the sunburned concrete when you encounter the oppressive forces of the imperialism and colonialism in Haiti, and you can taste the blood and salty water.

Because a lot of these felt provisional, incomplete, drafts instead of finished pieces. I'm not talking about pure polished prose, but too many of these felt like proof-of-concept, the kind of thing you write to remind yourself of your idea so you'll come back to it later, only these feel, to me at least, like Gay never got around to going back to them.I like this, and at the end, wanted to like it even more than I did."}, {"userName": "Matthew Salesses", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7113943-matthew-salesses", "userReview": "I thought I already gave this five stars.
