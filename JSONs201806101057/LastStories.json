In this collection, his last, he shows how people fare after life's betrayals, often highlighting loneliness and loss. Some are rather grim, but show a marked insight into the frailty of us all. I enjoyed all of these, but my three favorites included the first story, The Piano Teachers Pupil. In this story a woman, now in her fifties, considers herself fortunate but is also lonely. She feels a sense of genius skating from the playing of this young man. He has an unfortunate habit though, one that costs the teacher a few material items, but she feels the illicit trade is well worth it as long as she can keep hearing his playing.The others I liked were a rather grim Mrs. Crasthorpe, two lives that barely intersect will prove unforgettable for one, but in a rather sad way. There was just something in the melancholy tone in which this was written that appealed. I also enjoyed An Idyll in Winter, I felt this was the most compassionatly written of them all, as it would be so easy for us to judge and criticize the male character in this one.I may have come to this author late, and am sad that he is gone, but I do have many of his books still to savor. That is something in which to look forward."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "William Trevor's Last Literary Gems, or JengasI discovered William Trevor several years ago when listening to the The New Yorker: Fiction podcast, from 12/10/07, when Jhumpa Lahiri chose and read Trevor's short story \"A Day.\" You could say, it blew me away. Since then, I've bought and read most of two other of his collections.Trevor's mastery is not in prose or \"structure\" in the literary sense of the word. He is a maestro in constructing a story that reveals some human emotion or ice-shattering effects of our homocentric interactions. One way to describe this might be that he erects a Jenga tower of some human condition nudging the reader toward an ending that takes her breath away like a) pulling out the wrong block and all falls down, or b) removing just the right one, leaving her in awe at Trevor's perfection.Trevor's final focus, in his Last Stories, seems primarily on the deception and various varieties of betrayal, and its short- and long-term adverse effects on betrayer, betrayed and those collaterally damaged, and the harm done by one's inability to cope with disappointments flowing from high expectations. As examples, a father's betrayal by deception of a daughter who in turn attempts to betray herself by self-deception; a betrayal borne of pity of a woman without a family or friends; out of pity arises a man's betrayal of his family and an ironic lesson in the pain and cost of unrequited love; how a double betrayal by husband and best friend leads to a betrayal of self and humanity in the black heart of vengeance. In \"Giotto's Angels,\" which overlies a Dante Eighth Circle special betrayal, Trevor captures the reader with a tale (a bit allegorical possibly) of good versus evil, beauty versus ugliness.Probably the best of the brilliant bunch is \"An Idyll in Winter,\" in which a married man visits the farm estate of a girl who had fallen head over heels for him when he tutored her maybe ten years in the past. The story delves into the devastating fallout from adultery, but moreso from the girl's inability to accept that love cannot be perfect (maybe especially so for love once unrequited and for love on which a betrayal of another is built), it will not stay a winter white idyll, which leads to the biting and ironic self-rationalization: \"...she only wishes the men could know that love unchanged is as it was, is there for him among her shadows, for her in rooms and places as familiar to him as they are to her. She wishes they could know it will not wither, that there'll be no long slow dying, or love made ordinary.\"Highly recommended. If you're on the fence about William Trevor or his talent, I suggest you listen to Jhumpa Lahiri read his short story, \"A Day.\" https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/fic...I've got it on my list to read all of his stories. The literary world has lost a great one."}, {"userName": "David Curry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23497447-david-curry", "userReview": "After providing readers with his uniquely wonderful brand of fiction for more than half a century, the Irish-born William Trevor who died at the age of 88 in 2016, has left us a posthumously published final collection of ten memorable stories. Beginning with \u201cThe Piano Teacher\u2019s Pupil,\u201d in which a gifted piano student dazzles his teacher withy his skill while stealing objects from her home on each visit, and continuing through \u201cThe Women,\u201d in which a young girl who has always believed her mother is dead discovers that she is still alive, these final stories show Trevor still in full command of his materials and his art and his uncanny ability to find the beating pulse in quietness. Here\u2019s how \u201cMaking Conversation\u201d gets going:\u201c \u2018Yes,\u2019 Olivia says on the answering system when the doorbell rings in the middle of The Return of the Thin Man. The summons is an irritation on a Sunday afternoon, when it couldn\u2019t possibly be the meter man or the postman, and it\u2019s most unlikely to be Courtney Haynes, the porter.\u201cA woman\u2019s voice crackles back at her but Olivia can\u2019t hear what she says. More distinctly, the dialogue of the film reaches her from the sitting room. \u2018Cocktail time,\u2019 William Powell is saying, and there\u2019s the barking of a dog. The man Olivia lives with laughs.\u201c \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 Olivia says in the hall. \u2018I can\u2019t quite hear you.\u2019\u201c \u2018I\u2019m not used to these answering gadgets.\u2019 The woman\u2019s voice is clearer now. There is a pause, and then: \u2018Is my husband there?\u2019 \u201cAnd there we go.In a review of the collection in Britain\u2019s The Guardian, Julian Barnes confides that his literary agent wife told him Trevor \u201cliked to sit on park benches and eavesdrop on conversations,\u201d but that he never waited to listen to a whole story, so would get up and move on as soon as he had heard the small amount he needed to trigger his further imaginings.On the front of the dust jacket for Trevor\u2019s final book is a haunting photograph of two darkly clad figures, seen from behind, walking a snowy path, with dark little birds foraging in the snow in the foreground. One can imagine Trevor studying this scene and saying to himself that there\u2019s a story there."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBC Radio 4 - Book at Bedtime:The quiet contentment of a music teacher is stirred by the arrival of a new pupil, for whom all will be forgiven.Niamh Cusack reads William Trevor's gentle story of give and take.'The Piano Teacher's Pupil' is the first of five stories from William Trevor's final and posthumous collection, published this week to coincide with what would have been his 90th Birthday.

This is his last collection (he died in 2016), but, fortunately, he was so prolific that there are still a large number of his published collections that I have yet to read. As always these stories deal with seemingly ordinary people in seemingly mundane situations, but he conveys an empathy and depth of feeling that make his characters both familiar and unique. It's almost as though the author was eavesdropping on their conversations and inner musings. A music teacher marvels at her prodigy, not yet realizing that he is also a thief. A young girl in boarding school encounters two older women on the grounds who mysteriously show up at her hockey games and theatrical performances, bringing gifts and acting as though they know her. What is the secret behind their strange affection? An amnesiac man finds a key in his pocket; a hooker follows him home. A crippled man hires two foreigners to paint his house; but can they be trusted? Overall, another quietly surprising, satisfying collection from the Irish master."}, {"userName": "B K McIntire", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542631-b-k-mcintire", "userReview": "Such a thoughtful author.
