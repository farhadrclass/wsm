I loved Lexie and Adam and their character development was amazing. I really liked that they both had unique issues to work through but that they actually were able to help each other with those issues. I was thrilled with the spiritual development too. I love stories where one or more characters either share how they came to Christ or share how they come back to Christ. There was excellent balance in this book too. I loved the peek into the characters from the previous books. And Lexie's mom and son in this book are a fun addition. I really liked her mom's personality. She was kind of blunt with Lexie a few times and I loved it. And Matt, her son, was such a neat kid. I thought Hannon did a great job portraying him but not allowing him to completely take over the attention.There were so many life lessons in this book. Sometimes it is easy to judge a book by it's cover and I loved the constant reminders in this book that you cannot only look at outward appearance or life experiences. I love how Adam was able to use his past experience to help others so many times in this book.But truly I loved the romance the most. The flow of the relationship in this book was perfect. It seemed totally natural and not rushed. There was a great balance of fun, serious, and even some steamy moments. It was one of the more realistic love stories I've read lately.Revell provided me a copy of this book.

Sandpiper Cove compounds that love in a book that is utterly charming - a story of second chances, helping hands, the support of a community, and, of course, romance.Sandpiper Cove is the third book in the Hope Harbor series and tells the story of Lexie Graham, Hope Harbor's police chief, and Adam Stone. Readers will have first met Adam (or Stone, as he is more commonly known) in Sea Rose Lane. Ex-con, construction worker, stray-dog rescuer, he is a mix of bad boy and kind soul. Lexi has been married before and had her heart broken by her husband's sudden death. Now she is content to raise her young son, Matt, and protect the people of Hope Harbor. But when Adam is targeted by vandals, Lexi starts to get to know him, and a glimpse beneath his hardened exterior shows a man who is kind, gentle, and giving, and for whom it just may be worth risking her heart again. Everything about this book exudes peace and contentment. And not because the characters don't face trials - they do, and plenty of them. But there is just something about these Hope Harbor novels, be it the setting, characters, underlying faith principles, or themes explored, that give the stories a firm grounding. I was greatly looking forward to reading Sandpiper Cove ever since reading a sample in Irene Hannon's previously published novel. And I'm very happy to say that Sandpiper Cove lived up to all my expectations. Adam Stone is a fantastic character. He is plagued by guilt about his life choices, isolates himself, works hard, and wants to repay the kindness shown to him. He is intrigued by Lexi, but he is used to avoiding police officers, not becoming friends with them. But as he and Lexi work together to solve the vandalism case and help the perpetrator, he finds himself falling for her anyway. Lexi has been in love and knows the hurt it can bring. When she enlists Adam's help with her vandalism case, she doesn't except to find herself so attracted to the man. Add in some unresolved questioning about faith, a young man who responds to Adam's gentle guidance, a cute five-year-old, and a gorgeous dog, you have all the makings for a beautiful, Christian contemporary novel. I was so content reading this book that the ending completely snuck up on me. Suddenly there was the epilogue! Luckily, it was a nice, long epilogue. But the true gift lay in the author's acknowledgments - there will be more Hope Harbor novels to come!!! And, that makes me a very happy reader.The publishers provided an advanced readers copy of this book for reviewing purposes.

There's so much depth and intrigue in each and every one whether they are the hero and heroine or any number of secondary characters -- including Clyde, the dog!You can tell a lot about a hero by the way he treats a dog. And Clyde will tell you that Adam is a keeper. Some of my favourite scenes are between this life-battered pair. A man who has had a rough start in life and the abused dog he rescued. Both are wary of getting too close to people, finding comfort and safety in their solitude...until Lexie gets involved.Love the unusual pairing -- an ex-con and a police chief. It's all kinds of complicated and they are their own worst enemies. Both are wounded by past tragedies and their love story doubles as a beautiful redemption story.\"You know...it's interesting how our paths often smooth out if we give God a chance to pave the way, isn't it?\" (p 293) One of things I love most about Sandpiper Cove is the way the author has seamlessly woven an inspirational thread into the plot. Faith shines through the lives of some pretty memorable characters. Uplifting but never forced, bringing the warmth of hope to the most difficult situations.A complex romance that sizzles right to the very last page.

I snickered at the two priests lively banter glad they got along.I loved Charley too! He reminds of one of God's messengers that are always around and for some strange reasons they know before you even tell them.There's a song from Alabama about angels being all around us and up above.Friends are few and far between but when you find one hang on to him or her because those are the best kind.Books are sort of like that too!! It is funny that you can connect with some books and not others. Books can be friends or not. I believe in 2nd chances like Adam and Brian. I enjoyed this novel for this reason. Irene knows how to bring real life problems to fictional characters and solve their problems unlike in real life.Choices can be bad or good. it is up to us. But, they usually go better it'd go better if we ask for God's help.Satan wants us to disobey God. Not good!I loved the friendship between Lexie and Adam. To my idea, it's always best to be friends first. Like my husband and I were. To this day, we are still best friends. I think this wonderful novel is all about Trust. Trust is a very big issue in most cases. Like Adam.He needed to learn to trust people again and I feel him deeply. I too have a very hard time trusting people. Thank you God I have a trusting Jesus for He'll never fail me even when I'm at my lowest.I recommend this book to people who love contemporary Christian.

All opinions are my own.\" That done, SANDPIPER COVE is the third book in Ms. Hannon's Hope Harbor series. It easily stands alone, but fans will want to read Hope Harbor and Sea Rose Lane so they meet more of the towns residents. I loved the banter between the Catholic priest and the protestant minister. The two are obviously close friends who know what buttons to push. I also love the taco guy (I cannot remember his name but he is full of wisdom.) Some of the prior characters from earlier books make cameos in this book, but not in the major player way. Adam Stone. He might be an ex-con but he is a dream. Kind, loving, considerate, good to animals, hard working... a model citizen in ways that even people who aren't ex-cons would be wise to emulate. He is a sweetheart. My heart broke for him and I loved how he faced his fears and reached out to another trouble teen. Lexie started out a bit tough to get to know -- but as a police chief she has a reputation to uphold. Once she loosened up a bit she was just as sweet as Adam. I loved her mom, too. I am so happy to know there will be a fourth Hope Harbor book and I cannot wait to read it. But first, there Irene Hannon is starting a new romantic suspense series. If you love romantic suspense don't miss her books, she is one of the best. This is not romantic suspense, but a straight romance and I absolutely loved it. If you love Christian romance, don't miss SANDPIPER COVE or the other books in this series.

Filled with a familiar setting and hurting characters, this novel made me pay attention. From the first chapter when I met Adam Stone, I felt empathy for his plight. As an ex-con, I bet it is pretty hard to return to normal society. But Lexis, the town sheriff, see's past all that and uses his knowledge of crime life to help a teenager before he becomes a criminal. I really enjoyed the pace of the novel. It moved pretty rapidly. There were no moments where I wanted to put the novel down. As for the romance, it flowed naturally. I liked seeing Lexie and Adam fall in love. Again, the setting of Hope Harbor is idealic and soothing. A nice break from the hustle of city life, not like I live in the city, but anyways. I enjoy Hannon's contemporary romances, and I'm glad to know there is more Hope Haven novels coming.

But I'm glad I read it, because it still didn't disappoint at all! If anything, this one made me think about the way I view others I don't know well, and what I can do to help them. It was also a reminder for me to remember the strength of a church family, and what it can provide to a community - be it local or even global.Sandpiper Cove deals specifically with ex-con Adam Stone whose previous past is something he's worked hard leave behind him. As a handy construction worker with a love for woodworking, he touches lives more than he even realizes. And when he makes the acquaintance with police chief Lexie Graham, he changes both of their lives in more ways than one. Lexie, who has more than her share of baggage too, loves her job and the town she protects. Who wouldn't? Hope Harbor just sounds so lovely to live in! When the pair work together to keep the town intact, they are able to do some amazing things - for everyone they know, and some new faces.

Starting life over as an ex-convict, in a small town, is not an easy thing to do, but Adam Stone has managed to live a simple life as a responsible citizen, out of the limelight in his solitary cabin by the Oregon coastline. Until one day, the beautiful police chief shows up at his doorstep, tipped off by a local, about the recent vandalism on Stone's property and \"a tiny ember of hope for a future that included more than a loyal, lovable dog for a companion began to glow in a long-dark corner of his heart\". Lexie Graham has hardly noticed Adam Stone since he arrived in Hope Harbor, and she would have remembered it if she had. Ruggedly handsome, coupled with a humble spirit, is a hard thing to forget.

Lexie and Adam lived such different lifestyles, made very different choices, yet both faced horrible pain in their pasts. These were two people who, at first, would sound like opposites and unlikely to ever form a bond. However, I loved the way the author showed how God could take a person and truly make them a new creation.This story was sweet and deeply moving. It delved into many complicated emotions for both Lexie and Adam regarding their past troubles. And I think the author did such a good job of creating a strong, yet complicated, character in Adam. It was hard to watch him second guess things and sometimes feel that he couldn\u2019t possibly be worthy of anyone.

Two wounded souls trying to find healing and peace. An unlikely pair, perhaps \u2013 an excon and the police chief \u2013 but only on the surface. In their hearts, they are well-matched.

Romance lovers will not want to miss this one.Lexi Graham is the Hope Harbor police chief and is being pulled in too many directions at once. She has her son to take care of along with the residents of Hope Harbor, who have been dealing with a string of theft and vandalism. All of this is more than enough to keep her busy and leave zero time for anything else, romance included. With being so busy, she is caught completely off guard when she finds herself attracted to one of the victims of vandalism, Adam Stone. To make matters more complicated, Adam is an ex-con. He came to town after getting out of prison trying to make a new start. When Lexi catches one of the vandals, she talks to Adam about trying to be a mentor to the boy who is going through a tough time at home and could use his influence. Adam isn\u2019t sure he is the right person to help the boy, but feels God leading him to try. Together Adam and Lexi work to make a difference in the lives of those they can reach and see if there is anything left to make work between the two of them. This story is one of second chances. Lexi needs a second chance at love and Adam needs a second chance to prove he can be a good person. He doesn\u2019t come to town looking for love and doesn\u2019t think he deserves it either. I like the way he doesn\u2019t want feel as if he isn\u2019t good enough for Lexi, (even though deep down that is how he feels.) He has several people in town looking out for him who tell him that he doesn\u2019t have to be the same person that spent time in prison. He did his time and now he needs to be willing to move on from that. I love the message of knowing it is ok to make mistakes as long as we learn from them and move on to do the work God has planned for us to do. Sometimes we tend to beat ourselves up over things that we need to let go of. If God can forgive us, then we should be able to forgive ourselves and move on too. Irene Hannon is one of the top Christian Romance writers and it is for good reason. She can weave good story with a message and characters we want to see happy. Sandpiper Cove has all of that and more. It is the third in the series, some of the characters are the same, Charley is back and you can\u2019t help but love him, and some are new. You don\u2019t have to read all to enjoy each separately, which is nice. I recommend this to readers that love a good, clean romance story that will put a smile on your face.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher.

I think this may have been my favourite so far. In particular, this story takes on the challenge of an ex-felon who has tried to find new life in this small town on the Oregon coast. After meeting the Pastor of Grace Christian during his stint in prison, Adam Stone has found a purpose to life. With the addition of Jesus, and the promise of help from the Pastor, Adam has been working for BJs construction company. Volunteering behind the scenes to help others in the town, he has started to build the kind of reputation he never dreamed possible. Lexie Graham is the Hope Harbor Police Chief. She's had a rough past of her own. With the tragic death of her husband 5 years ago she's found peace and contentment back in the hometown of her youth. Living with her Mom, while she raises her son Matt, she's quite happy to not upset the status quo. That is until her world collides with Adam's and she discovers just how much she misses her role as 'woman'. That is, once she realizes she is more than cop & mother. There's trouble brewing in the town, will she be able to solve the case and protect her heart and reputation? There is a line that stood out to me - \"Those who smile the least are often the ones who need the smiles the most.\" How often do we notice those living on the fringes of our lives that may have needs we are unaware of. It doesn't take much to share a smile, and there is great power in a real genuine smile towards those who just may need it. Thanks to Netgalley & Revell for the eARC.

This novel focuses on Lexie and Adam. Each character's history reveals past pain and difficulties that taint their hope for the future. Irene is a skilled character creator and each member of this cast walks out of the pages, including Clyde the dog - spoiler alert: whilst injured, he is fine in the end! Lexie's passion for small town life, work and her family is easy to relate to and she regularly lives out Christian kindness even as she struggles to understand how God could allow the suffering he does. It is the central theme and the answers debated are both encouraging and thought-provoking. As each character reached a crossroad, I hoped they'd make the right choice not wholly sure how it would unfurl. This suspense makes it a pacy read, I finished it within the day.

I appreciated the multiple povs, the clean content, and the message of redemption. However, I just finished a book that featured a felon and there were just too many similarities for me to fully appreciate this story. Both Hs had dogs who were abused. Both moved to a small town to live after finishing their prison sentences. Both h's had educated jobs while the Hs worked blue collar jobs. In hindsight I should have spaced the two books out a little. Ah well. Other than that, the ending was a little too sappy for me and the tendency of this author to solve everyone's problems tied up with a nice bow felt a little contrived.

Sandpiper Cove by Irene Hannon is Adam Stone and police officer Lexie Graham\u2019s story. But in telling their story, Irene Hannon updates us on other characters\u2019 lives as well. The new characters introduced in this book are well developed and have authentic, relatable struggles. This is a fantastic book, as are all the books in this series. I sincerely hope this author continues with this series. I received a digital copy of this book from Net Galley in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Suzie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7431258-suzie", "userReview": "Do you ever feel like you\u2019re unworthy of something? That you don\u2019t deserve anything good in your life because of bad choices or mistakes you\u2019ve made in the past?Step into Adam Stone\u2019s shoes. As an ex-convicted intent on starting over and living a good but solitary life, Adam is content with his little home on the edge of the Oregon seaside town of Hope Harbor. But when Police Chief Lexie Graham enters the picture, the loneliness he\u2019s tried hard to bury is as obvious as the blue of the Pacific.With the help of two young boys, a slew of townspeople, and a fish taco selling artist, will Adam discoer that God wants more for him? That he was made for community?This is a story of God\u2019s grace and forgiveness. A story of letting go of the past and clinging to those who support you. Sandpiper Cove is a beautiful reflection of God\u2019s endless love for each and every one of His children.I\u2019m looking forward to visiting Hope Harbor again (and I\u2019m looking forward to my trip to the Oregon Coast this summer even more). Pick up the newest installment in the lives of the residents of the town where \u201chearts heal and love blooms.\u201d today.Disclosure statement:I receive complimentary books for review from publishers, publicists, and/or authors, including NetGalley.

I was so engrossed in the story, eager to see how all the pieces would play out, that I was disappointed to turn the page and find myself at the epilogue already. I have enjoyed each of the books in this series, but this might be my favorite this far. I love how each of the stories can stand alone as they focus on different individuals in the town of Hope Harbor, but their stories weave together throughout the entire series. This was a well-written romance with a bit of mystery/intrigue. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and am excited to know future titles will be released in this series."}, {"userName": "Trixi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36944112-trixi", "userReview": "Having only read this author suspense novels, I already knew I was in for a treat with her contemporary one! I was especially intrigued because this is set on a fictional town on the Oregon coast where I live. What a treat to visit new places without even leaving my house! That being said, I jumped at the opportunity that was given me by the publisher to read Sandpiper Cove. Have you ever felt too far gone for redemption and a second chance at life? Especially when the choices you\u2019ve made in the past were deliberate? That\u2019s how Adam Stone feels! Ex-con, who made all the wrong choices growing up, landed him in prison for a time. Hopeless & desperate until one man reached out and showed him a better way. Clinging to a God he didn\u2019t know, Adam thus began to want to make a better life for himself. Even at the expense of living like a hermit on the outskirts of Hope Harbor. He\u2019s a broken hero who knows he\u2019s been given one last chance to make things right and good. He enamored me! His childhood was no picnic, thus making his thinking a bit skewed and his heart reluctant to get close to anyone. That is until Lexie walks into his life! Single mom and police chief, she finds an opportunity to help both him and a troubled youth to walk the right path. Having been burnt in love, the last thing she wants to do is get involved with anyone, especially an ex-con who she knows little about. Will these two broken people allow God and the town of Hope Harbor heal all wounds? This author hard-hits tough areas in life! She doesn\u2019t sugar-coat messy pasts or make everything perfect in one day. She shows how God can take a person\u2019s heart and change them from the inside out! Not an easy or overnight process and the person must be willing to change. She doesn\u2019t hide the pain someone goes through or how it has long-lasting effect on her characters. What she does show, is a hope-filled faith in God and the support of good people in our lives. Each one of these characters dug deep in my heart, making me feel as they were my own friends. I loved the vivid scenery, almost like being on the beach where I live. Adams dog Clyde took center stage, what a faithful companion who\u2019s thrived on love & tender care! I loved everything about this book, especially the faith message and watching love grow between Adam & Lexie! The romance was just the right pace and I enjoyed seeing it blossom, perfect hero and heroine for each other. Even if they don\u2019t think so at first! This was the only book in the Hope Harbor Novel series I\u2019ve read, and you bet I will be going back to read the other two. Although this is a great stand-alone and the author gave glimpses of the previous books. If you\u2019re looking for engaging characters who live real lives, a beach escape, faith-filled hope that comes from God & sweet romance, than I highly recommend this one!*I was provided with a complimentary copy by Revell publishers.

The writing style has a lovely, comfortable feel about it and I'm delighted that this is part of a series I can catch up with. The characters are drawn so that you feel you know them and can join them in amongst the story, A great mix of romance and friendships.

We encounter familiar characters that we love like Charley and the dynamic pair of seagulls, Floyd and Gladys. Then there's the familiar \"we take care of our own\" atmosphere in the fictional town of Hope Harbor. \u201cSometimes you must give people an opportunity to put the faith they express on Sundays into practice.\u201d (31)When ex-con, Adam Stone arrived in Hope Harbor 18 months ago, he didn't think people will want to be friends with him due to his past. Who would want to associate with someone with a criminal past, let alone date him? He's in for a surprised and a humbling experience when the town show him what it means to not judge a book by its cover and accept one who's given his life towards the good of others. And I for one, are just as humbled by reading the different messages of change, forgiveness and humility that brings out the good in people. What may be unexpected or seem impossible is not when the heart is right. Adam and Lexi's encounter to budding romance was beautifully written - authentic, relatable and faithful. \u201cAny damaged board can be smoothed out and made new with work and patience.\u201d (20)I must also say the timing of this novel hit a personal note, especially with the relationship between Adam and his canine companion, Clyde. What sweet acknowledgement placed on the heartwarming connection of Adam and Clyde, as well as Clyde and Matt, Lexi's 5 year old boy. Adam's fatherly figure to Brian's storyline was also inspiring, opening possibilities for second chances and how many young kids really just need someone to care. From pasts to present, Hope Harbor series, including Sandpiper Cover will pull readers in to experience the peace and hope these stories create. \u201cThose who smile the least are often the ones who need smiles the most.\u201d (146)\u201cIn the end, it comes down to trust. We have to accept that God understands why things happen, even if we don't - and try to learn and grow from our misfortunes.\u201d (121) This review first appeared on Just Commonly blog.Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the author/publisher.

A single mom to 4-year-old, Sam, and only daughter to her widowed mom, she doesn\u2019t need the vandals who keep striking in her town. It\u2019s bad enough that they wrecked the garden club\u2019s planters, now she finds out that they\u2019ve targeted ex-con, Adam Stone. Adam has stayed out of trouble and worked hard at his construction job since his release more than a year ago. Since he has no desire to be on the police radar, Adam cleans up the graffiti and goes about his business. When they come back and seriously injure the only friend he has, his dog, Adam finally lets Lexie investigate. Lexie never expected to feel sympathy for Adam but any man who cares for a dog as much as Adam does can\u2019t be all bad. As she gets to know him, the attraction she feels comes as a surprise, and not necessarily a welcome one. He\u2019s a felon; she\u2019s a cop \u2013 how in the world could that ever work? Adam came to Hope Harbor when he was released because of the pastor \u2013 and because he had nowhere else to go. He\u2019s doing his best to keep his nose clean and attends church every time the doors are open. The message of hope he gets inside the church doors keeps him going in a world that has done its best to beat him down. When vandals start targeting him, he figures he deserves it after the mistakes he\u2019s made. When Lexie catches one of them and asks for Adam\u2019s help in mentoring the young man, he can\u2019t believe she knows what she\u2019s asking. As he works with the young man to repair some of the damage he and his accomplice inflicted, Adam\u2019s self-esteem begins to look up. Can an ex-con prove that he has something to offer even when the woman he wants to offer his heart to is the head cop?Whether Irene Hannon is writing gripping suspense or sweet romance, her books are ALWAYS un-put-down-able! Sandpiper Cove is book 3 in her Hope Harbor series and was a powerful heart-tugger! Adam Stone is the kind of man any woman would be proud to stand beside but all he sees when he looks in the mirror are the mistakes he made. Lexie Graham is a strong woman carrying a load of guilt on her shoulders. Even the \u201cminor\u201d characters are fleshed out. The Catholic priest and Protestant minister are an absolute hoot! Charley, the fish taco guy, dispenses wisdom and encouragement with his tacos. I\u2019m really hoping Ms. Hannon will bring us more stories from Hope Harbor. This one is one for the keeper shelf!"}, {"userName": "Edward Arrington", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23635274-edward-arrington", "userReview": "One of the best parts of this book was in the author\u2019s note at the end when she states there will be another book in her Hope Harbor series. Reading this and the other books in the series is like glimpsing a small snapshot of what true Christianity is about. On occasion as Reverend Baker and Father Murphy get together, the reader may start to question that statement, but these two men hold each other in high regard and simply love hassling each other about their differences as the pastor of Grace Christian and the priest at St. Francis. I have mentioned Charley\u2019s fish tacos in the reviews of the previous books in this series, but I have failed to mention his knowledge of what is happening in Hope Harbor and his obvious wisdom. Somehow Charley seems to have insights into the lives of his customers that even they do not realize and often has a word for them that either helps deal with situations from the past or prepares them for what is about to happen. In this story, the main characters are Lexie Graham, the chief of police in Hope Harbor, and Adam Stone, who is called Stone by almost everyone who knows him. He is an ex-convict who was led to become a believer by the pastor of the local church who also served as chaplain in the prison. Upon his release, Stone came to Hope Harbor because Reverend Baker assured him he would be welcome and helped Stone find a job and a place to live. One of my favorite lines in the book was spoken by Stone when he and Lexie were talking about the furniture he built as a hobby. He was explaining to her his reason for making furniture: \u201cCreating beauty out of discards, turning rejects and scraps into something functional\u2026\u201d (page 114). That line so beautifully sums up a theme that weaves its way through the entire story, beginning with an ex-con and the dog he rescued after finding it beside the highway after a car had hit it and continuing with a teenage boy who got in with the wrong crowd. Oh yeah, not everything is roses, but helping lift up others is clearly communicated. I believe you will love the story."}], "description": "Hope Harbor police chief Lexie Graham has plenty on her plate raising her son alone and dealing with a sudden rash of petty theft and vandalism in her coastal Oregon hometown.
