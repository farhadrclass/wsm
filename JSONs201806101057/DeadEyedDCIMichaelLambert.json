I also want to thank Net Galley and Carina UK for providing me with an advanced copy in exchange for an unbiased review. Wow, Matt Brolly!! This is a debut novel? Really??Dead Eyed is a terrific thriller from first time British author Matt Brolly. This novel has everything one would expect from a seasoned best selling writer. The plot involves a multidepartmental search for the \u201cSouljacker\u201d, the person responsible for the grizzly deaths of nearly a dozen people over a 20-year time frame. Also in the fray is our protagonist, ex-DCI and ex-\u201cspecial Group\u201d member Michael Lambert, who is investigating on his own. He is actually on leave of absence from the police force because of a horrific personal tragedy that occurred two years previously. I loved Michael. His meticulous work ethic and attention to detail reminded me of me, so of course, he\u2019s my kind of guy. We are also privy to Michael\u2019s deteriorating personal life and internal angst, which contribute to his high level of determination to crack this case despite repeated requests from law enforcement to stop interfering. He is clearly an outstanding detective. I thought almost all the characters were well written; In addition to Michael, I particularly liked DCI Sarah May. I hope she will be reappearing in subsequent installments of this new series.The plot is complex, mostly believable, and highly engaging. I was so riveted by this book that I was unconsciously blocking out everything that was happening around me. Let me issue one warning: there are several graphic scenes; there one short passage towards the end that is one of the most horrendous descriptions I have read in a thriller. I actually physically shuddered when I read it! The pace of the story is quick. The tale is full of twists and turns and chapter-ending cliffhangers. The suspense, killing at times, is really agitating; I could not read the last 25% fast enough. I thought I knew where the story was going, but I was wrong\u2014the ending is a shocker!I highly recommend Dead Eyed to anyone looking for a good thriller. It is an outstanding read and deserves to find a wide audience. It\u2019s that good. My rating is 4.5. I am rounding it down to 4 in order to leave room for a higher rating for book 2 of the Michael Lambert series, Dead Lucky, due out in early January 2016 (and already preordered by me). Give Matt Brolly a shot. He\u2019s the real thing."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3908840-sue", "userReview": "Many thanks to Netgalley, Carina & the Author for allowing me a free e-copy of this book to review. This is the debut novel from Matt Brolly where he introduces us to DCI Michael Lambert, an ex-policeman currently on leave following the death of his daughter, for which he blames himself. I really enjoyed this story. It was very well written and flowed well, the characters all connected together, and I was kept guessing right up till the author let us know whodunnit!Dead Eyed is a the story of Michael Lambert, a British detective on the case of the \u201c Souljacker killer\u201d, a serial murderer who removes the eyes of his victims while carving an inscription in Latin on their chests\u2026\u201d the soul lives in the eyes.\u201d Years ago, a friend of Lambert\u2019s at university, was killed this way, and it seems that the killer has started again. Lambert is a very troubled soul, and carries a lot of unresolved baggage from his past. He is a loner, his marriage is over, and he does things his own way, disobeying orders of people in authority. But he is an experienced detective, who has to overcome his personal demons to finally solve the mystery. Had the killer sent Klatzky the file to get Lambert involved?If it was the same killer from 20 years ago, then why had the killer stopped for years\u2026and what made him/her start back up?Dead Eyed is a tense crime thriller with a fast paced plot that is full of twists, turns and surprises, with a story that keeps the reader engrossed to the very end.

I cannot believe this was Mark Brolly's first novel a powerful but gruesome read which was really enjoyable.DCI Michael Lambert thought he closed his last case yet when he is passed a file concerning a particularly gruesome murder Michael believes that this is no ordinary killer at work.The removal of the victims eyes & the Latin inscription carved e into their chests very intricately is the calling card of the soul jacker cold blooded murderer who struck close to Michael 25 years earlier.Now the long buried case is reopened & Michael is determined to find the killer.He gets together with DCI Sarah May & together they look into the killings the mo starts to change as the perp sews their eyes shut as well as their lips. Michael also has some baggage to contend with as his wife Sophie blames michael for the death of their daughter Chloe 2 years earlier.While looking into the case Michael & sara get together as his marriage is on the rocks, then Sarsah suddenly disappears & the race is on for michael to save her.I loved the character of Michael & sara they jelled together well & both are strong i have already bought the 2nd one so looking forward to that.

The soul dwells in the eyes.\nThis book started out slow and took its sweet time to pick up the pace. Initially, I had to struggle a bit to get into the book, but once I was 15% through, I was in for good. The pace picked up and the book went from slightly interesting to quite interesting and then I was on the edge of my seat almost biting my nails.The story felt a little too long but considering that it is the first book in a detective series, I'm okay with it because I know that establishing the basics and the background is really important.I like Lambert... a lot. He's one hell of a stud detective. One that I would love to read about. He's all broken and stuff but, again, he is a real stud! He is everything a detective should be like- smart, intelligent, sharp and daring. And this is all to say that the author truly nailed the characterization. Even the other characters, esp. Sarah May, were quite good and totally relatable.The writing is great and the shifting POVs keep the book interesting and intriguing. The descriptions were so good that I squirmed every time another victim turned up with either their eyes cut out or stitched shut with black thread... And, trust me, it is one of the best things about this book.The only thing that I find a little off is that the motive of the killer wasn't made clear. I mean after reading a seemingly lengthy book, there's nothing that I wanted more than to know the gory and dirty details of the killer's motives or, at least, the driving force behind them.Still, I enjoyed the book. And for a debut novel, this book is really amazing. Unfortunately, I've stopped rating books with 1/2 stars, otherwise, this book would have been 4+1/2 instead of just 4.I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this series.You can also read this review at The Reading Bud."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9809518-christine", "userReview": "Well hello DCI Lambert!The story takes us to the past and an unsolved serial killer mystery. When Michael Lambert was at university, one of his friends was brutally murdered. The victim has his eyes removed and a Latin phrase carved on his chest. The \u2018Souljacker\u2019 was responsible for a series of murders, all with this strange signature.Michael Lambert, in the present day, is now ex-CID and ex-Special Group following a personal tragedy. He is a bit of a mess, with a crumbling marriage and a career on hold. Michael is a brilliant officer, who just needs a big push to get him back investigating. A \u2018Souljacker\u2019 style murder and a visit from an old friend, Simon Klatzky, brings Michael back. Michael is forced to cooperate with the official investigation, led by DCI Sarah May. He becomes a suspect in the case. Michael is on his own, seeking answers. He is being drawn deeper and deeper into the case. Who is the \u2018Souljacker\u2019 killer and why is he back?I wasn\u2019t expecting to love this as much as I did. We get an impressive fast paced serial killer thriller, that introduces tough but wounded Michael Lambert. The serial killer ticked many of my boxes, with his macabre, twisted way of killing his victims. The use of Latin phrases reminded me of that dark TV series Messiah. However I am not sure that many people of Lambert\u2019s age would have any understanding of Latin. A nice chilling pseudo-religious touch though.And I adored the beautifully damaged Michael Lambert. He was a force to be reckoned with, once he started looking into the new murder case. A real action hero. We meet his ex-wife, the people he was friends with at university and see his recent tragic history. Lambert is still a bit of a mystery, in spite of all of this. I find myself wanting more. This is a good sign with a brand new author.Recommended. Dead Eyed is a promising and fast paced crime debut, that kept me cheering for the heroic Lambert and loving the darker twisted side."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32020643-elaine", "userReview": "WOW - what a brilliant debut novel! Congratulations to the author for his skill in crafting a macabre serial murder mystery for his hero, DCI Michael Lambert, to endeavour to solve whilst still attempting to avoid being the next victim! It is a tense crime thriller with a fast paced plot that is full of twists, turns and surprises - a story that keeps the reader engrossed to the very end.DCI Michael Lambert isn\u2019t a fresh faced, archetypical hero. Instead he\u2019s a man struggling to cope with personal tragedy and reluctant to return to work until a serial killer he unsuccessfully sought twenty years ago starts murdering again. The characters are well developed, with their own angst pervading their actions and reactions - indeed if I\u2019d met one particular character in real life I\u2019d probably have been having stern words with him (to put it politely!) but that just demonstrates how well this is written. The macabre nature of the murders are reflected in the choice of title. The plot is finely tuned and well crafted making this an enthralling search for the truth and a totally engaging read worthy of a master of this genre. The final chapters are riveting and the epilogue promises more to come - I will certainly be looking out for other books in this series and by this author in future.Thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley, too, for letting me read an ARC of this book in exchange for this, an honest review."}, {"userName": "Linda Strong", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13684015-linda-strong", "userReview": "Dead Eyed -Having eyes that lack emotion or seem vacantDCI Michael Lambert has been on leave for two years following the death of his daughter, for which he blames himself.

Insane, but chillingly good as a killer.Lambert is great as a character, he has his weaknesses and demons in his past, but he\u2019s just so easy to like as a protagonist. Sarah May proves to be a strong female character in Dead Eyed too, adept and intelligent. Together they work the case simultaneously, leading to interesting developments in the investigation.I don\u2019t like going to far into plots as I think it takes away from the readers experience if they know too much.

There are so many great books out there that often, it can be hard to compete. Well Matt Brolly does not need to worry on that front! This book was bloody brilliant!What I liked about this book was the fact that although it was pure fiction, it felt like a case that could have happened. I love crime (no sh*it Sherlock you say!) but I love it more when the lines between fiction and reality get blurred. Where you start to question whether or not there are bits of the story that have some truth to it.

Imagine during the delay he had even released a sequel and still was kind enough to send me both the copies twice. Yes twice. So I don\u2019t know how I can express my gratitude for being so patient and kind about it So let\u2019s talk about the book Dead EyedNoticed how every episode of CSI opens with a dead body and during the course of forty minutes, after playing with a lot of beakers, test tubes and super cool gadgets wearing lab coats and glasses, investigators gets a case closed and murderer behind the bars even before you could finish saying \"wow that was superawesomtasticfreakingcool\"  (no? ok maybe its just me\u2026)  so my point is that unfortunately this doesn\u2019t happen in real life and this book just proves that bitter truth all the more. In a way that is also were I am a bit disappointed too..The plot is absolutely a whodunit favorite with enough meat to chew on and keep you hooked as till the very end you have no idea how this all came about. In fact when I was actually shown the culprit I was still scratching my head in total unbelief and gluing together the larger picture. So yes for a thriller the plot is really nice and complex enough.Treatment is where the things get a bit different. I am assuming that the author is aware of the practical and real life scenario of a murder investigation and howthings work in there. Either that or the author had done a really terrific job in his research as it shows in the book and while showing the realistic side he may have gone a bit too far because things gets too realistic aka slow and boring  (shuuuz\u2026that was rude) The book shows how investigation unfolds in real life, which is like waiting for long lists of paper works, permissions and questioning and stuff which isn\u2019t as glamorous and colorful as it is shown in movies and TV series\u2026so for quite a while in the book\u2026each chapter is moving with very minimal development in the case which means that though the book has a steady pace, in terms of events you may have to wait a bit for things to happen.The author kind of avoids fictionalized case investigation, you won\u2019t see our investigating officer getting those light bulb moments and stumbling upon that one missing link that unfolds every secret magically\u2026NOPE\u2026.You have to literally wait for our officer to pick up each tiny piece and piecing it together as the book continues. So in the end I say it\u2019s a good start to a good investigative series but you need to keep an open mind and a bit of patience. Those who want realistic investigation series, this is an amazing pick but if you are one of those who would prefer a little adrenaline pumping, completely spiced up thriller you might have to lower down your expectations a bit but otherwise I would say, one should give the series a try."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44068050-kate", "userReview": "*** 4.5 out of 5 stars ***When the author initially approached me about reviewing this book I was instantly gripped by the description and immediately begged for a copy, the killer in this book sounded twisted, dark and absolutely fascinating.Dead Eyed is the first book in the DCI Michael Lambert series and is an incredibly impressive d\u00e9but novel by Matt Brolly.

This book was written with skill and confidence. The style of writing is crisp, clear and wonderfully descriptive. Brolly has carved out a place for himself beside the great crime writers with excellent plotting, great characters and a killer that really leaves the reader chilled to the bone at times. I don\u2019t want to say too much about the plot itself, it would spoil your enjoyment of the book!Soul Jacker is a killer that really \u201cworks\u201d well, a sociopath that goes around killing, removing the eyes of the victims and then carefully carving Latin phrases into their bodies.

However, I'm afraid, I wasn't entirely convinced or satisfied by the final confrontation with the killer and the way the story is wrapped up in the epilogue.\u200b\u200bHaving said that, this book is a gripping fast-paced page turner full of twists and turns. I have to say that for a debut thriller, this book is brilliant and I really enjoyed it. I will certainly be on the lookout for more books by this promising, talented author.Many thanks to Matt Brolly for inviting me to read and give an honest review of his book through Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45282317-jackie", "userReview": "Wow what a chilling book that has you gripped right from the beginning.

She was an only child.DCI Lambert thought that he had closed his final case, which was dubbed \u2018The Souljacker Case\u2019. Similar killings start up again and the case is reopened. The hallmark of \u2018The Souljacker\u2019 is to remove his victim\u2019s eyes and carve a latin inscription on the victim\u2019s chest.Michael carries out his own investigation, using insider knowledge. The body count continues to rise and DCI Lambert realises that \u2018The Souljacker\u2019 could be after him next. The book follows the investigation of the case.I loved this book and read it in a relatively short space of time (for me anyway). \u2018Dead Eyed\u2019 is well written and structured. The chapters are short and written in such a way that you just have to read on. Reading this book was similar to being on a rollercoaster ride, with plenty of twists, turns and stomach churning moments. The action was fast paced and at times I had to literally hold my breath. If this book was a film then I would have been watching through my fingers. The story gradually gathers pace until matters come to a dramatic and terrifying conclusion.The characters are well written and well formed. DCI Lambert is a damaged person. He was in a fatal car crash, in which his daughter died. Lambert carries a big sense of guilt around with him and blames himself for his daughter\u2019s death. He becomes estranged from his wife. Both are clearly grieving but they are so consumed by their grief that they are pushing each other away. Lambert has been on compassionate leave from work but this case (& his links to the victim) gives him his hunger back and his passion for the job. DCI Lambert is popular with friends, family and his colleagues. The villain is creepy, dark and sinister. The ease with which the villain can switch personalities is shocking.In short I loved this book and I would definitely recommend it to others. This is a very good debut novel by a very talented writer, who is clearly destined for great things. I can\u2019t wait to read more from this very talented writer."}, {"userName": "Marina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5267904-marina", "userReview": "* Copy provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*Michael Lambert has to live with the skeletons in his closet. Twenty years ago, he lost a college friend. The guy was brutally murdered in his own room in the college, his eyes removed, his body mutilated with words carved into the skin. An image pretty hard to forget.Now, twenty years later, another college friend receives photos of a body mutilated just like the one before. But the previous murder wasn't the first one. It was just one more body in the row, a work of the serial killer called The Souljacker. It was the last murder until now, when photos of another body appeared. Is The Souljacker back? Why did he stop for twenty years? It really him now or is it a copycat? What is the link between the victims? The research shows that the new victim is also a friend from college days. Something strange is going on. With DI Sarah May breathing down his neck, Lambert starts his own investigation. Two of his college friends are killed in the most horrible way, and the third one is involved. As the investigation shows some progress, the number of bodies arises. Lambert and his friend Klatzky are the main suspects in DI May's investigation. But someone else is the main suspect in Lambert's investigation. Matt Brolly is not a name familiar to me, but is definitely a name I'll be looking for in the future. His writing is creepy, violent and full of tension, and definitely doesn't lack dead bodies. The murder scenes are vividly described, bringing a dose of horror and panic. The main character is a real action hero, a former member of an undercover police unit. He is not just anyone involved in the killings. He uses his knoledge, connections and skills to find the real killer, 'cause everything points out that he is the target. Still recovering from his little girl's death, he has to put himself all together in order to save the ones he loves. \u201eDead Eyed\u201c is a gripping psychological thriller, a story full of creepy and violent murdering scenes and characters with closets full of skeletons. Unpredictable and adrenaline-loaded, it is an absolute treat for fans of hardcore murders (in books). I absolutely recommend it!My opinion: 5 / 5"}, {"userName": "Celeste N\u00ed raois", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8260780-celeste-n-raois", "userReview": "DCI Michael Lambert thought he\u2019d closed his last case until he\u2019s passed a file detailing a particularly gruesome murder, Michael knows that this is no ordinary killer at work.

Michael has been out of work on leave for two years, he's has his own issues and personal tragedy to deal with throughout the story too, his marriage is also crumbling. Can he deal with all this amongst taking this case on to track down the serial killer or will he crumble as the body count increases??This is Matt Brolly's debut novel and what a debut it was, it was brilliant, it had me gripped from the first few pages right through to the end, there were some great twists and turns too. I didn't know who to trust or not to trust. I thought I'd worked out who the 'soul jacker' was but I was completely wrong.

DCI Michael Lambert is officially on leave, recovering from the accident that killed his daughter and put him into a coma. He isn't living, but it simply going through the motions until he receives a desperate call from an old friend fallen on hard times. Simon has received pictures of a dead body with its eyes removed and a Latin inscription etched on his chest. The body mirrors that of the soul jacker's earlier victims. In college, one of their friends was murdered by the soul jacker. Now it appears the killer is active again. Lambert begins his own investigation, going deep into old files and finding troubling answers to questions which were not originally asked. As the body count rises, he has to trust DI Sarah May and find the killer before he becomes the next victim.The perspective switches between the lead characters and the killer's main accomplice. Tension builds as the reader can see how far ahead the killer is, while still masking his identity. When the killer is revealed, it comes as a completed surprised.

This is enough to galvanise Michael back into action, and he starts his own investigation, not completely alongside the investigating officers. He manages to get information that the ones working on the case don't and it becomes apparent that this case is personal to Michael. There are a few suspects, but I will admit I had an inkling half way though, and although being highly surprised at the finale, I had pegged who the serial killer was. There are a lot of gruesome details in the murders and scenes of crime, which are mildly disturbing. I found the story telling to be easy to follow, and had a good sense of urgency in the crimes being solved. I love reading about police officers and their thoughts about the crimes, and how to piece them together, and this one was baffling, especially with regards to motive. Sarah May is great officer, in charger of her first big case, and she and Michael seemed to have a healthy regard to each other.

This is the debut novel from Matt Brolly whereby he introduces us to DCI Michael Lambert. Michael has not worked for a couple of years due to personal reasons but gets drawn into the case of the 'Souljacker' it soon becomes apparent that he has various links to the case spanning twenty-five years. This story has so many twists & turns, I was a little confused at the beginning trying to establish who all the characters were but it is so well written that it then becomes second nature & each persons role falls into place.The writing is very descriptive & not for the faint-hearted & if like me you have a phobia of eyes it can be extremely gruesome! However I overcame my dislike of the subject matter quickly because I was drawn in to such an extent I was keen to know what would happen next. We learn so much about Michael's friends, colleagues, daughter, wife during the book that each one leaves an impression whether you like them or not.I was gripped by this story & on a couple of occasions thought I had figured out who the 'Souljacker' was but I was wrong & certainly didn't see the conclusion coming ..

Think James Bond meets Inspector Rebus meets the Da Vinci code and you have some idea of what kind of book it is.Lambert was a really intriguing character. He is a tough policeman who doesn't always do things by the book. He clearly has influence on other officers who allow him access to intelligence he shouldn't really have and also has their respect. His personal relationships are interesting too. His marriage has all but broken down following the death of his daughter and he seems to struggle to deal with the emotions he feels. I believe this is the first in a planned series of novels featuring DCI Lambert, so it will be interesting to see how this character develops.The storyline in this book is completely absorbing. The short chapters make it a fast moving book with lots of twists and turns. It is a book that will keep you guessing and reading 'just one more chapter' to find out what is going to happen next.
