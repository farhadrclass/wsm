En eso resumo todo. Ahora mismo ni siquiera s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo explicar lo que sent\u00ed cuando comenc\u00e9 a leer este libro, pero es que es inexplicable.Siempre es una delicia leer a esta autora, que poco a poco se ha ganado un lugar entre mis favoritas. Les juro que no miento cuando digo que todos los libros que me le\u00ed suyos han sido de m\u00e1s de 4 estrellas para m\u00ed. Y siendo como soy (una coda pretenciosa y quisquillosa con los libros) eso es algo bastante grande que decir.Su pluma es magistral, la narraci\u00f3n, no puedo explicarlo de otra manera, pero es \"c\u00e1lida\" siempre me he quedado con un poquito de cada libro que le\u00ed de esta autora porque hay sabidur\u00eda en sus libros, hay conciencia y humanidad en sus p\u00e1ginas.Los personajes de este libro son tambi\u00e9n maravillosos, si esta autora sabe escribir, lo mejor es conocer a sus personajes, todos han sido coherentes y llenos de una candidez sobre cogedora, pues a pesar de que a veces hay mucho sentimiento y dolor, el amor lo puede todo.Jake es un hombre duro, hura\u00f1o y un poco desconfiado pero con un coraz\u00f3n de oro, es posesivo y sobre protector con aquellos a quienes ama, es dulce, pero tambi\u00e9n puede ser despiadado... es de esos personajes que tienes que ir descubriendo conforme vas leyendo. Me enamor\u00e9 de sus detalles, de su culpabilidad y de sus esperanzas y miedos. Porque si algo tiene Jake es una personalidad arrebatadora, tan bien planeada que no puedes sino quedarte suspirando despu\u00e9s de ver a un hombre como el llorar por una chiquilla.Al principio me chocaba un poco la diferencia de edades pero bueno... detalles, detalles. Jajaja \u00cdndigo en cambio es salvaje. No hay palabras para describir el sentimiento de empat\u00eda que uno puede desarrollar con un personaje como el de ella. Es que es pura luz, est\u00e1 ni\u00f1a en un cuerpo peque\u00f1o es amor y miedo al mismo tiempo. Miedo por no ser lo que los dem\u00e1s esperan, miedo por ser algo que detesta, miedo por juzgar sin pensar, miedo por sentirse avergonzada de lo que es.Salvaje si, pero no rebelde, humana. Esta ni\u00f1a es real. No se, no encuentro palabras para decirles el gust\u00f3 y disfrute que fue leerla y conocer su historia de amor llena de inocencia.Hab\u00eda pensado yo desde la p\u00e1gina 1 comenzar con un libro 5 estrellas, y creo que mi 2017 no pudo haber empezado mejor. No es 5 estrellas pero se le acerca bastante, quiz\u00e1s soy demasiado quisquillosa pero la onda sobrenatural me chaf\u00f3 un poquito la historia, creo que es normal trat\u00e1ndose de Comanches y sus tradiciones pero bueno, soy muy mala cuando este tipo de cosas me las meten en un libro sin esperarlo.Si nunca le\u00edste est\u00e1 serie, hazlo por favor, date la oportunidad de descubrir historias que apachurran tu coraz\u00f3n y que guardaras por siempre en tu mente. Con una narraci\u00f3n \u00e1gil y sencilla pero sumamente emocional, las historias de estos Comanches y blancos te robaran el aliento. Perm\u00edtete enamorarte de cada uno de ellos aunque sientas romperse un poquito tu coraz\u00f3n."}, {"userName": "Auntee", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886675-auntee", "userReview": "I didn't have high expectations going into reading this book and I'm glad I didn't--I was pleasantly surprised with how engrossing this story was. Of course it wasn't the epic that Comanche Moon was, but it was well-written, entertaining, and even suspenseful--and held my interest right through the tear-jerker ending. And yes, at times a was a little miffed with young Indigo--I thought she was stubborn, immature, and a bit headstrong--and a lot of that I blame on her parents.I'm kind of surprised at Loretta and Hunters's parenting skills. Although there's no doubt that they love their children, I was surprised the way they raised Indigo. I thought she had way too much freedom (especially as a young teen) and could have used more guidance. And her father let her be a \"powder monkey\" in his mines? Hard to believe that he would let her do something so dangerous. I guess this was the Comanche way of raising your kids or something--sort of a 'hands-off' attitude and let them learn from their mistakes, but jeez, I thought Indigo needed more boundaries. And I was disappointed in Loretta as a parent. After all she went through to be with Hunter, I thought she'd be more open with Indigo, especially when it came to sex and marriage. But she was just the opposite, clamming up and blushing whenever Indigo broached the subject. So poor Indigo goes to a reluctant prostitute to get advice about men? I just knew where the book was heading after that!So yes, Indigo was a little immature, spoiled and stubborn at times, and she really had some hang-ups about white men and her 1/4 Comanche heritage, but for the most part I liked her. I could understand her fears of being 'owned' by a white man, and who could blame her after what happened to her when she tried to fit in to the white man's world 6 years ago. So she was sort of stuck between two worlds--the white man's and the Comanche--and needed to find herself and the place where she belonged. I loved her relationship with her animals and especially her 'pet' wolf, Lobo, and yes I shed a few tears for him too.As for Jake, well I took to him right away. You could tell that he was a good guy, even though he came off as a bit autocratic and set in his beliefs with his sister Mary Beth. But I thought he was mostly kind and patient with Indigo, even if he did have one or two stupid moments. And even though it seemed like it took forever for him to win Indigo's trust, I enjoyed the journey. And his willingness to give up mostly everything about his former life just to make Indigo happy, endeared him to me. What a catch! I felt he went through a lot of personal growth, was willing to meet Indigo more than halfway, and I was just waiting for her to realize that.No compaints here about their love scenes, except that they came late in the book and there wasn't that many. The last 50 pages or so moved very quickly, what with Indigo and Jake finally hiting the marriage bed, and them having to deal with the scum that was out to destroy their lives. I will say that the episode in the mine was a nail-biter and tear jerker all rolled into one! Whew!So, fans of \"Comanche Moon\", make sure you read this one. How could you not want to know what happens to brave Indigo, and catch up with Hunter and Loretta too? This was a fine romance with a good plot and lovable characters who have to work a bit for a big HEA. Can't wait to read about Indigo's brother Chase next, in Comanche Magic! 4 1/2 stars."}, {"userName": "jenjn79", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946249-jenjn79", "userReview": "(((I re-wrote this review because I wasn't happy with it)))I hate it when it happens that I can't quite decide what to say about a book. Which is the case of this one. I'm of two minds on it and I've been sitting here debating what to write in my review.First off, I think it'd help to write a more detailed summary since the one on the back of the book (which is the same one on the book page here at GR) doesn't tell you much about that story. Sooo.....Jake Rand grew up with a father who would do anything it took to strike it rich - even working his wife to death, literally. Jake swore that when he grew up, he would never let the women in his care work themselves to the bone. They'd be coveted, as his mother should have been. Years later, he's achieved that. But when he finds out that his father may be using questionable business practices to acquire mines, Jake's life is thrown in turmoil. He decides to travel to Wolf's Landing to investigate his suspicions.In Wolf's Landing, all Indigo Wolf wants is to take over her father's mining business while he recovers from almost being killed in a suspicious cave-in. She has no use for men, especially white men. But then Jake Rand arrives and her life will never be the same. Within days, she finds herself married to her worst nightmare, a white man, who she believes will treat her like the squaw she secretly believes she is. How she'll survive, she doesn't know....On the surface, this was a quick, enjoyable read like just about any Catherine Anderson novel. The setting is great and there's a lot of emotion in the story. There was one scene about 80 pages in that had me in tears for a good 20 minutes. The romance was pretty good. I liked Jake quite a bit. Though he's far from perfect, he's patient and has a good heart. He does everything possible to get Indigo to trust him. This story has a similar feel to Comanche Heart in that it's mostly about the relationship and romance between Jake and Indigo rather than about life as a whole, as Comanche Moon was. The book just didn't have the powerful story that Comanche Moon did, but it was still a good tale.It's when looking beneath the surface that I find some fault with this story. Mostly with the character of Indigo. One of the premises of the first book in the series, Comanche Moon, was that Hunter and his white wife would leave the tribe and make their own place in the world where they would meld their lives together in a mesh of Comanche ways and white ways. Given that, and the bits of Indigo shown in Comanche Heart, I expected Indigo to be a bit of a warrior princess, a young woman with a strong sense of her Comanche heritage, but an ability to be part of the white world that she lives in. But instead, Indigo comes off as rather neurotic and weak most of the time. In the beginning, she's like I expected, but then she turns into a woman with practically no spine at all, a woman with absolutely no sense of self. The blame of which is lain at the feet of her attempted rape as a young girl and the fact that she is a Comanche woman and they are supposed to act a certain way.Which is what I had a problem with. Indigo is painted as someone who only knows the Comanche way to be a woman - to be submissive and obedient to a man. And that, for me, completely just doesn't go at all with the whole premise of Hunter and Loretta trying to live a life that melds both their worlds, as Comanche Moon says they wanted to do. I found it really hard to believe that Hunter and Loretta would raise a daughter in their new world who believed it was okay to be used by a man, to bow to their every whim and want. I just kept thinking, what happened to the meshing of beliefs? It's hard to explain it right other than to say, knowing the characters as I did, having read the previous two books in the series, I had a very different expectation of how Indigo would be. And I was really disappointed in her character and disappointed in what that said about Hunter and Loretta as attentive parents.I was also disappointed in the fact that Amy and Swift (featured in Comanche Heart) were completely MIA throughout the entire book. They got a mention or two, but that was it. There's no sense of if they're happy or not, if they've had any children, nothing. But that's kind of a running problem I've had with Anderson's books (the only lacking I've every really had with her stories) - that she often barely utilizes past characters from a series in new books. Which is also shown in the fact that there's no reference at all to Hunter and Loretta's story - how they came to be in Wolf's Landing. It would have been great if Indigo had talked to Jake about her parents' lives.So yeah...if you take this book just as it is, on its own, it's a nice romance to read. But if you're one who likes to look at the big picture when it comes to a book in a series, this one comes up a little short.I still give it 4 / 5 stars, though, because despite it's faults, the story kept me interested and wanting to keep reading. Even when parts annoyed me, I wanted to see where the story went. Sure, I could have liked the book more, but it was good enough."}, {"userName": "Corrine", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2084774-corrine", "userReview": "I am surprised by how much I liked this book. I wasn't expecting to, because I was disappointed by Comanche Heart, and though this one is definitely no Comanche Moon, it has it's own unique charm.Indigo Wolf, daughter of Hunter and Loretta, is nineteen, wild, a tomboy, and the apple of her parents' eyes. She dresses in Comanche leathers, works the mine, and runs the woods with her wolf friend Lobo. All of that comes to a stop when Hunter is nearly killed in a mine accident, and they bring in Jake Rand to supervise. Jake suspects that his father has been constructing \"accidents\" at mines and then sending Jake in to buy them for their company Ore-Cal. So he poses as an out-of-work foreman and gets a job for Hunter Wolf. When he learns that Hunter's daughter is the one who is going to show him the ropes, he's alarmed - women, after all, shouldn't be working at something so hard, as his mother was forced to do. When he inadvertently ruins Indigo's reputation, he and Hunter force Indigo into marriage, and this is where the story really picks up. Jake just can't understand Indigo's ways - she was a spitfire hellion before but now she cowers from him. She spoke her mind before, and now she obeys his every word. What he comes to see is that Indigo had been taught some hard truths about herself six years ago at the hand of a different charming white man, and that plus her Comanche upbringing, are forcing her to be a dutiful, if miserable, wife. I love Jake Rand - it's funny and touching to see him try so desperately to understand Indigo's ways and feelings, and he more than goes out of his way to make her life as happy as possilbe, and he's often disappointed. When he finally reaches the end of his patience and snaps, I wanted to stand up and cheer for him. Indigo is spoiled, but she has good reason to be uncertain: she was forced into a marriage with a man she doesn't trust, and she secretly hated the part of herself that was Comanche because it made her feel less of a person. A very sweet, light at times, heavier at others, love story that is a good addition to the series.

Felt, the ending (or last 1/4 of the book) made up for some of the frustration I felt with other parts of Indigo Blue. Part 3 of the Comanche series and the setting for Indigo Blue takes place about 20+ years AFTER Comanche Moon where Hunter and Loretta's daughter (second child), Indigo, is 19, in Wolf's Landing, Oregon. For me, the story took too long to get going. I wasn't \"hooked\" until page 70 or so and wondered if I was going to enjoy this one as much as the previous books in the series. After page 70, I was grabbing the tissues. Then the story began moving along at a fairly nice clip. I was frustrated by both Indigo and Jake's characters, but felt the author explained them well--later in the telling. Several heartbreaking (gut-wrenching) moments were in this little book, so be warned. I was very disappointed that Swift Lopez and Amy were not characters in Indigo Blue. They had a minor update that mentioned where they currently lived and Swift's profession. In my opinion, Hunter should have contacted Swift for help in his situation and the excuse he didn't was lame. Also, Hunter should have contacted his son, Chase, too. Chase had a brief mention, but no role in this one, either. I was also confused with how readily Hunter \"let go\" of Indigo to a virtual stranger. And, it didn't make sense the way Indigo tried to be the dutiful wife like an Indian, when she was raised to be in both worlds. Loretta never cowed down to Hunter. I think Indigo had preconceived ideas of what her role as an Indian wife should be to a white man. In a way, a scene in Comanche Heart (#2) when she all but denounces her White heritage by burning her clothing--except the Indian apparel--and is mentioned again in Indigo Blue justifies that. However, it appeared Indigo picked and chose what she would accept in her life from both cultures. That was my frustration. Jake was an overbearing, control freak who treated Indigo like a child. He was hard to take, at times. There were a couple up minor updates on the Sheriff, the country store owner and Elmira who flirted with Swift Lopez in #2. If not for the last 1/4 of the book, this would have been a 3 1/2 star from This Reader."}, {"userName": "Trang Nguyen", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2295764-trang-nguyen", "userReview": "I can never go wrong with Catherine Anderson. Before reading this book I wasn't reading at the pace I normally go. But I am so glad Indigo Blue didn't disappoint me and I'm back to reading everyday again. Indigo is three quarters white and a quarter Comanche. After a horrible incident at the age of 13 she decided to let go of her whites ways and be completely absorbed with the Comanche tradition and heritage. Indigo had decided at the age of 18 she wanted to be free like the animals and listen to the song that called her in the wind. However, her song never mentioned a handsome white man who has come to Wolf's landing with a different agenda then he portrays. Jake Rand is instantly infatuated with Indigo and after an unfortunate accident certain circumstances lead Jake to marry Indigo. Indigo is not happy with the nuptials because she feels all Jake wants is a possession and not a wife. For the next three weeks they learn each other and Jake realizes how much he loves Indigo and how he wants nothing but love from her. Even though Jake is being a sweetheart to her she can't help but to be terrified of her husband presence. The two must learn to understand, trust and care for each other and when they finally accept each other they encounter bad situations that might pull them apart.

She's grown into a young woman who constantly seeks to run and hide from herself, her heritage, and especially white men. But when Jake Rand shows up to work at her family's mine, her running days are over.This book does not possess the same magic that Comanche Moonhad. It's not a difficult book to get into, but it's sort of easy to walk away from. I didn't feel the driving need to get back into it and find out what was happening between Jake and Indigo. At least not until about the last 100 pages. That's when things really started to feel wonderful in the book. Their relationship and its barriers were torn down, some true romance was shown, and I feel we finally got to see the full potential of their characters seperately as well as together. My complaints about this book are that the first 3/4 of it was rather slow and unproductive, and the last part of it was predictible. I wish we could have had the growth and epiphanies more towards the middle of the book. Those scenes with them together and Jake showing his love were wonderfully written, they just came so late in the book. I'm not sure I'm so interested anymore that I want to run out and read the last book in the series.

Daughter of Hunter of the Wolf Comes into Her Own!Set in Oregon in 1885, this is the story of Indigo Wolf, daughter of Hunter of the Wolf and his white wife, Loretta, from Comanche Moon and Comanche Heart. When she was younger, Indigo fell in love with a young man who broke her heart and betrayed her trust, telling her she was just a \u201csquaw\u201d and good for only one thing. Though his attempted rape was thwarted by her uncle, Swift Lopez, Indigo is still scarred by the experience and wary of men who are attracted to her. She has become her own woman, tending to the wild animals of the forest, wearing Indian dress and helping her father with the mine.When a series of mine accidents have her father, Hunter, laid up with injuries, along comes Jake Rand to offer his hand at managing the mine (though he seems to spend little time doing that). In reality, Jake is the oldest son of a wealthy owner of mines, many of which were purchased when the mine owner was in trouble, as Hunter is now. While Jake originally came to purchase Hunter\u2019s mine, when he finds out his father may be causing the mine accidents, he comes in disguise to learn the truth. He didn\u2019t count on meeting the bewitching Indigo who soon has him forgetting he has a fianc\u00e9 back in Portland. And he shakes Indigo\u2019s world, too. (\u201cThe moment she first saw him, she had sensed it\u2014an inexplicable something, a strange feeling of recognition\u2014as if her destiny had finally come calling.\u201d)As with the first two books in the series, Anderson has captured the time period and the Comanche culture with practiced expertise. She makes it look easy when it isn\u2019t. We see Wolf\u2019s Landing and it\u2019s unusual blending of cultures from Jake\u2019s point of view, a stranger to this part of Oregon. Jake is impressed by the love he witnesses in the Wolf family. He has known poverty as well as wealth, but he has never known such simple joys as the Wolf family shares. So when an unusual happening forces a \"shotgun wedding\" to Indigo, Jake steps up to do the noble thing even though Indigo rebels at the idea of marrying any man.Anderson tells the story of Jake and Indigo beautifully with elegant dialog and believable twists and turns. And wonderful secondary characters! I loved the family priest, Father O\u2019Grady. He and Jake have a very funny conversation about Indigo that had me laughing out loud. It\u2019s a great read and I recommend it!

I was unsure about how I would feel, since Catherine Anderson's books tend to be very dramatic and she seems to have some perverse obsession with heroines who are raped, abused, and tortured - and/or witness all of these things.Indigo's wariness and reluctance to trust Jack went on a little too long for me and I grew a little frustrated. She was a wonderful and unique heroine, however, and I completely fell in love with Jack. Watching him fall in love with Indigo and begin to change from the unsatisfied and distant man he was at the beginning to the loving and tender man at the end was an absolute joy!Certain parts of this book almost had me tearing up, which says a lot, since I'm not an emotional reader.

Of course I loved Comanche Moon, like most readers. I wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did, which was a nice surprise as it surpassed my expectations. Always a good thing. Probably the only little negative with the book from my perspective was that I did expect Indigo to have a bit more feistiness about her. In Comanche Heart she was a spunky little thing, and she seemed to have changed her personality from then to this book, that she had become very submissive. She just seemed too submissive, especially in light of being brought up in the white world and had a pretty full on mother in Loretta, from Comanche Moon. It just felt a little strange that she seemed a bit too changed from the previous book to this one. I know she did have a very bad experience in Comanche Heart which would colour her life, but I don't think that years later her personality would have changed that much to really squash the spunkiness out of her. But I suppose on the other hand, she was very protected in her little world by her parents, so it was only a little niggle for me. However, having said that, there were many things about Indigo that I did like, so if I hadn't already met her in Comanche Heart, I wouldn't have noted a personality change and would have just thought she was a very quiet, innocent, fascinating girl. I loved her sweet personality, that she could communicate with animals, that she couldn't lie and I really felt like she was something special, that any man would have been lucky to have her. I really did believe that she was as special as Jake thought her to be. I could really see why he was so fascinated with her.I really loved the hero too. He was a strong man, but very patient, and treated Indigo, for the most part, like any woman would want to be treated by her man. He really was a good mix of what any woman would want in the strength of personality side, as well as his loving side. Together, they really were a winning combination.I did love the story too. I know some people said Indigo resisted the hero too long, but it didn't seem so to me because the story is only set over a number of weeks and even though it was hard work for Jake to win Indigo over, I felt that a few weeks was a good timeframe for him to do it. Any sooner and it wouldn't have been believable.This book made me cry in a few places, especially about 80 pages in. I knew from another review that something bad was going to happen, but I wasn't expecting it so soon. Unfortunately I was on the train and made a total fool of myself by crying in front of everyone. As if that weren't bad enough, I thought, oh yeah, that's done, let's move on and a few pages later I had tears running down my cheeks again. Hate that! If'n I'da known it was going to be so soon in the book I would have waited to read it at home where I could blub as much as I really wanted to!All in all I enjoyed this book more than Comanche Heart, the second book in the series. I really loved both the H and the h. I really believed that they loved each other and that they would for the rest of their lives. A very satisfying book. I'm very glad I read it."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1730638-wendy", "userReview": "I have read all of CA's books and I have loved most of them, and again I loved this as well. Being part of the Comanche Series that she has written that put a nice twist for me. I absolutely LOVED Comanche Moon and though this one was good it didn't quite have the magic that Comanche Moon had. Indigo is the daughter of Hunter and Lorretta Wolf,from Comanche Moon. She has grown up in Oregon with her father being a Mine owner. (Which I can't really see a Comanche Indian being in a mine all day, but okay.) When Hunter is hurt by a cave in in the mine he leaves the running to Indigo. With little options available Hunter thinks of selling the mine to make ends meet. Then a man (Jake Rand) with mining experience shows up needing a job and Hunter hires him to run the mine until he recovers from his injury's. Jake Rand grew up in Mining towns across the west and it ended up killing his mother from all of the hard work. Finally his father hit it big and now he runs his fathers mines and takes care of business. When his brother tells him of his fathers dirty business dealings he goes to Wolf's Landing to investigate if his father could be behind the accident that hurt Hunter Wolf, as a way to acquire the mine. Jake takes a job working the mine to get the information that he needs. But Indigo is a complication that he wasn't prepared for. She is innocence and sunlight in a dark world for Jake and he can't help his attraction to her. When they are stranded in a abandoned shack after her pet wolf in shot, for the night, her reputation is compromised and Jake decides that he must marry her to save face for both of them, not to mention he is so very attracted to her. Jake proceeds to try to win Indigo's love and make her comfortable with their situation, using patience and understanding. but though he doesn't intend to love her he falls for her and they find happiness together in the white mans world, with a little of the Comanche Spirit thrown in. I give this one 4 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": " \u1d0d\u026a\u1d04s \u2716amante de los spoilers\u2716", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27760776-s-amante-de-los-spoilers", "userReview": "\"El sorprendente feminismo de Catherine Anderson\"O sea tenes a Jake que es machista, no en el sentido que cree que las mujeres no son capaces sino que toma una actitud paternalista (siendo PATERNALISMO:  \"La tendencia a aplicar las normas de autoridad o protecci\u00f3n tradicionalmente asignadas al padre de familia a otros \u00e1mbitos de relaciones sociales tales como la pol\u00edtica y el mundo laboral\".) Es a fin de cuentas una forma de justificar el machismo porque el hombre toma decisiones por la mujer seg\u00fan lo que \u00e9l cree que es mejor para ella aunque no siempre concuerde con los deseos de la mujer.Una escena que me pareci\u00f3 muy rid\u00edcula fue cuando Jake quiere comparar el racismo que Indigo sufre pero al rev\u00e9s, se pone en papel de victima de \"a mi me prejuzgaste por ser blanco\" y la tenes a ella que sufre el racismo todos los d\u00edas de su vida, que un grupo de hombres blancos la quisiera violar y querer compararlo con el hecho de que ella no le tenga confianza por ser blanco es irrisorio. Termina siendo el t\u00edpico hombre blanco cis rico hetero que le molesta que las cosas no se le sirvan en bandeja de plata, pat\u00e9tico. PEEEERO si bien nos tenemos que fumar a Jake siendo un cerdo machista la mayor parte del libro lo bueno es que aprende el TERRIBLE error que comete al querer tomar decisiones por las mujeres de su vida (ya sea su mujer o su hermana) y teniendo en cuenta que este es un libro escrito en el 92 es digno de admirar, eso no quita que es sexista y machista por momentos pero bueno, no se puede todo en la vida. Adem\u00e1s de que me tocaron la vena sensible y que me fascina como la autora retrata a la cultura comanche, tiene un aire sobrenatural cuando los personajes hablan sobre la naturaleza o como \"ven la verdad en los ojos del otro\"."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125147-robin", "userReview": "I rated this four stars because it is a sequel to Comanche Moon which is a necessary read in order to fully appreciate this. While, unlike Commanche Heart, this book could, to some degree, stand on its own, but wouldn't be as good without the prequels. Indigo was a bit frustrating, but when trying to argue against her staunch stubborn streak, one starts thinking about Anderson's ability to write a sympathetic character, in this case, Indigo's past and mostly her mysticism which makes her so different from the \"norm\" that you can't really fault her for being apprehensive about everything and everyone. I think her attitude about white men was a little too extreme considering she was raised by a very fair and wise half comanche father and a white woman. I loved the love story, but I was disappointed in the lack of role by her father who it would have been nice to see recover enough to get out of bed and bring out some warrior skill to avenge his daughters attackers and her mother, Loretta, who seemed to have lost her spine altogether. Four stars is being a little generous, but I did look forward to picking up the book and reading more every day just because Anderson is a talented pen."}, {"userName": "Hava", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132683-hava", "userReview": "I don't buy many books anymore, but I saw this latest book by Catherine Anderson at the store the other day and couldn't resist. Catherine's good enough to own (which is really saying a lot for me).And I wasn't disappointed at all. Other reviewers said that the other books in this series were better than this one; I disagree. I actually teared up a few times while reading this book. I loved it. What I especially love about Catherine is her unusual characters. No other romance author out there writes about women who are blind, or who are in wheelchairs. It simply doesn't happen. As for \"Indigo Blue,\" although Indigo doesn't have anything physically wrong with her, she does have some issues because of past history and her heritage. As always, Catherine does an amazing job of dealing with the topics with realism and sensitivity.My only complaint is that I have to wait until 2011 to read book 4 in the series!

This installment in the \"Comanche\" series finds Hunter and Loretta's (from \"Comanche Moon\") daughter, Indigo all grown up. In telling her story, Anderson delves into the issues surrounding the problem of being a \"half breed\" Indian woman in the late 1800s. We learn the heartbreaking realities Indian women experienced when marrying white men, the vast gap in cultures and the difficulties in overcoming them. While reading, it was hard not to become frustrated with Indigo over some of her decisions and reactions but as the story unfolds one see's her heart and her reasoning. That is the miracle of Ms. Anderson, allowing us to grow and understand right along with her characters.

It takes one sweet girl, who is happy with little more than the basics in life, to show him what real happiness is.
