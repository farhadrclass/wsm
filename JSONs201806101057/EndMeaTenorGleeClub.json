I was pleased enough with the story and the characters, as well as the mystery plot, when I finally did pick it up, to buy the next one, End me a Tenor (plus, great title! I love puns!) I found this second effort to be excellent! I'm really enjoying most of the characters and the scenes are written really well and vividly enough to 'see' the story unfold.As to the murder plot - well it was, IMO just really, really well done! No really clear suspects where any one stood out from the others. No late entries that stood out and become obvious. And a nice surprise reveal at the end. The ending was totally implausible, but it's a cozy mystery - we're not drowning in verisimilitude in this genre. This is a fun, engaging read that entertains from beginning to end.The only small bits of the story I didn't like were the love triangle, although I can kind of see that resolving itself in the next book - the groundwork was laid for the decision to be made. If I'm right, I'll be quite pleased. And lastly, what's rapidly becoming a pet peeve of mine - having the secondary characters telling the protagonist \"you have to figure this out!\" \"you have to find out who did this!\" etc. etc. While at the same time berating her for putting herself in dangerous situations. The whole device is such a cop out and such a massive turn off - at least for me.But I'll be waiting eagerly for the next book release!"}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2366949-erica", "userReview": "First off, we need to discuss the fact that End Me a Tenor is quite possibly my favorite title for a book ever.Joelle Charbonneau has managed to combine some of my favorite things ever - dance, show choir, music, and mystery - into a wacky series that is just so much fun to read. While I loved the first book in the series, Murder for Choir, I think Joelle Charbonneau has even written a stronger follow up. I was absolutely enchanted and fell back in love with the characters as soon as I started. I was grinning like a loon the entire time I was reading, never for an instance wanting to put it down. This series has what I would consider one the best written love triangles - I love both guys and they are both just so dreamy. I love both guys in question for different reasons. There are scenes with both Devlyn and Mike that are absolutely adorable and my heart gets pulled one way and then the other. Joelle Charbonneau is such a talented writer - I just love her prose. As soon as I started reading End Me a Tenor, I was completely sucked back into the world of Paige Marshall and loved seeing how things would play out. While the mystery is very central to the plot, there are so many other subplots going on that just fascinate me. I particularly love everything that goes on with Aunt Miller - she is an absolute hoot. The characters are so well written.End Me a Tenor is absolutely hilarious. I found myself smiling and chuckling alongside the characters in between grinning like mad the entire time. I had so much fun reading it and I cannot wait to see what is next for the gang. Three cheers for Paige Marshall! I cannot wait to see where her story will lead next, since at the close of End Me a Tenor, things are looking pretty fabulous. There was so much growth for Paige throughout the book and I love watching that alongside a lot of the other characters growing as well. End Me a Tenor is a must read for anyone looking for a good read. Regardless of your prior preference, End Me a Tenor is an excellent mystery with a good romance and extremely well written characters. With each book she writes, Joelle Charbonneau only further convinces me that she is one of the most talented writers out there. This one would get a standing ovation from me ;)"}, {"userName": "LORI CASWELL", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770012-lori-caswell", "userReview": "High School Show Choir Coach Paige Marshall has her hands full. She has just learned that two other high schools are performing the same number as her choir in the upcoming competition season. She needs to quickly replace that song, complete with choreography, with another before they debut at the holiday concert in just a few days.Paige has also been selected as one of the soloists in a production of the Messiah and is rehearsing daily to prepare. She is so excited, but the man singing the tenor part is world-renowned tenor David Richard and his overblown ego is hitting all the wrong notes. When the tempestuous tenor drops dead during rehearsal Paige finds herself investigating another murder and finds out the tenor was certainly no choirboy.Dollycas\u2019s ThoughtsWhat a wonderful encore to Murder for Choir. Charbonneau hits all the right notes!The author combines mystery with a romantic triangle that reads like a marvelous melody. Should Paige be with Devlyn or Mike? The hunky detective or the talented teacher? Paige is extraordinary as she deals with keeping her current job while trying to further her singing career plus she is dealing with her love life, her students, and her boss Larry, and trying to catch a killer.The story has layers and is full of humor. The characters just draw you right into their lives. It is easy to see the author is a performer but she is also a terrific storyteller. Her insight into the musical arena shines through this entire literary score.As I said in my review of Murder for Choir\u2026Like Glee, you will love this book!Like cozy mysteries, you won\u2019t be able to put this one down! I can\u2019t wait for the next performance. It must almost be time for the Show Choir Competitions to begin."}, {"userName": "Sonia Reppe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/455200-sonia-reppe", "userReview": "Look at the cover--it's so cute. I enjoyed this so much, the second in her trilogy of Chicago-based choir murders. Very cozy and fun. I knew this author when she was a grad student in voice at DePaul. So what I don't get is: why the inaccuracies about the Messiah production? (I know Joelle knows her stuff). Why do the characters refer to the Messiah as a \"show,\" when it's a concert? And the performers wouldn't be referred to as \"the cast\" because it's not a show, like an opera or a musical. Also, the soloists (which includes the main character) would not have to be at all of those rehearsals for the choir and orchestra--just one rehearsal before the concert, to practice with the orchestra. It's not like a show where there is staging that needs a lot of rehearsals. And a stage manager for a large concert I can see, but an assistant stage manager too, for a concert that doesn't involve costumes or scenery or props? I'm guessing Joelle picked The Messiah to fit in with the Christmas theme of the book, but it seems like she wrote about an opera production and then switched it to The Messiah. (And the main character gets excited when the \"show\" sells out, but as this takes place in Chicago and is written as the big sing-along Messiah downtown, any Chicago singer will know that this is always sold-out).I really like this series for the voice of the main character, and especially for the love interest element. She has two desirable guys in love with her. I wasn't planning on reading the third book, but now I think I will just to see who she ends up with."}, {"userName": "Suspense Magazine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3282664-suspense-magazine", "userReview": "\u201cEnd Me a Tenor\u201d is the second in the continuing adventures of Paige Marshall, gifted soprano on her way to becoming a star in the classical music world. While waiting for her big break, Paige is staying with her eccentric aunt Millie, Mary Kay salesperson extraordinaire, Millie\u2019s live-in gentleman friend Aldo, and Millie\u2019s snarly poodle, aptly named Killer, and working part-time at a local high school coaching the school\u2019s glee club.Paige is thrilled to be cast opposite world-renowned tenor David Richard in a holiday production of Handel\u2019s Messiah. But things go terribly wrong at dress rehearsal when Richard keels over dead after drinking poisoned water. Paige\u2019s glee club is also participating in a big-time holiday choir competition, and the egos at work in that group are just as huge, and the rivalry just as intense, as the ones exhibited by the Messiah cast. When David Richard\u2019s death is ruled a murder and Paige realizes that the water bottle he drank from looks exactly like the one she had in her own hands just a few minutes before Richards keeled over in front of her, she decides to find out what\u2019s going on. And discovers that there are more possible murder suspects than she ever imagined.\u201cEnd Me a Tenor\u201d is a witty and fun read. A real Paige turner. (Oops. Sorry. Couldn\u2019t resist.)

I think I liked the first book, \"Murder for Choir,\" just a little bit better, but I still love this one! Same lush characterization and fun dialogue as the first one. Amateur sleuth Paige Marshall continues to be likable. I also like the start of her dilemma between the two men in her life - drama teacher Devlyn (who wants everyone to believe he is gay, and therefore keeps his relationship with Paige under wraps) and cop Mike. I'm even dying to find out what happens between Aunt Millie and Aldo!The story involves Paige trying to keep her job as show choir coach, while also getting what could possibly be her big break in the professional opera singing world. Then an egotistical, world-famous tenor in the professional show drops dead, and Paige once again finds herself tracking down a killer. I don't always get Paige's logic in persisting with her search when she could just as easily let the cops do it. Other than that, though, this is a smart and funny mystery.I hope there will be a third book in the series. I'd love to catch up with Paige again!"}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24899734-julia", "userReview": "When I got this book from my friend and read the cover blurb, I was really worried about reading something that felt like a \"Glee\" episode, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a great deal more than that in this book. This is the first of this series that I have read, and although I don't usually like to start a series anywhere other than book one I didn't think it made a major impact on my enjoyment of this book (although there are some back-story questions that need answers).I liked Paige - I think she is walking a line of self-discovery that feels a little familiar to me; the one between what you always dreamed of doing (opera singing, in her case) and what you're doing to pay the bills (teaching high school glee club). The supporting characters were interesting, and the amateur sleuthing didn't stretch the bounds of credibility any farther than in most cozy mysteries. I did figure out WHO well before the end of the book, although I wasn't correct in my guess as to WHY.

I liked this one a lot better than the first in the series, perhaps because we've gotten to know the main character a lot better and her personality has developed into a charming, talented teacher and soprano. Paige is fun as a wise-cracking and appealing show chorus teacher. I liked all the music-related discussion and her understanding of the music and her students as they prepare for their winter concert. She is in a mild love triangle between a fellow teacher and the cop who keeps getting involved in her sleuthing issues. I like her sense of humor and Charbonneau's humorous turn of a phrase, such as \"...he didn't understand. I didn't either, and I was having it explained to me.\" or \"...the tears in ???'s voice would have elicited my sympathy if not for the threatening-me-with-a-gun thing.\" Secondary characters are also entertaining, such as the silly but scarily efficient Aunt Millie and the piano-playing and cooking Aldo.
