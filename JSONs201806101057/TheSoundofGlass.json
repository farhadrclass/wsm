Storytelling seems to be as natural and breathing air to her and I for one will never miss a book she puts out. The Sound of Glass of one of her best. The book blurb does a great job of explaining what the book is about so I won't recap the book chapter by chapter for you. What I will tell you is that you best forget the laundry, the dishes, dinner, or any other chore that you had planned on doing today because Karen White will be monopolizing your day. This is a character driven story about family, forgiveness, letting go, with just enough mystery to make it impossible to set down. I felt so strongly for Merritt. Her pain, her fear, and complete distrust was tangable as she tried to build a new life in the house she had so expectantly inherited. What I love the most about Karen White's writing is it is not rushed but it is never slow. She is an expert as pacing her stories and bringing her characters to life. I am still thinking about Loralee and Merritt and sweet little Owen. I read so much that sometimes I forget details of a book months after I have read them. This is never the case with a Karen White novel. I would also highly recommend The Time Between. Five Stars.

Wow! The story and characters were outstanding, and they pulled me in right away. Merritt is a widow, and she inherits her late husband's grandmother's home in Beaufort, South Carolina. There are a lot of surprises awaiting her there, including a brother-in-law she didn't know about, and a reunion with her estranged stepmother, Loralee, and 10-year old half-brother, Owen. And the secrets! Dark secrets from generations past that come to light.I really grew to love all of the characters, even Merritt with her stubborn, standoffish personality, and sugary sweet Loralee sharing the wisdom of her mama. I cried along with all of their struggles. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dealt a tough deck of cards, that\u2019s for sure, but it\u2019s time to pull up your big-girl panties and move on.

And I am first going to get through the important stuff, like ... you know... the shiny, thick hair.. darling, for crying out loud, you should know it is hair extensions... tumbling down the leopard-print silk, full make up ... uhummm ... actually, the eyeliner and eyebrows was tattooed on, cute figure, cute skirts and cute clinging t-shirts, pretty toes with dark pink polish, gorgeous pair of legs, that pretty pink suit with a bow at the collar ... and ... oh yes ... for him, an impressive set of abs with broad shoulders and legs that filled out his khaki pants just right. And then there's cute little Owen, the young boy with a world of wisdom with which he enchants all the adults around him, a big old southern mansions, a buried secret, an odd sisterhood, and a whole lot of drama to be addressed by everyone involved: orphaned, abused, tortured souls - the whole lot of them.Then there's the wisdoms all women, that is, real women, should know:\nClothes should be tight enough to show that you're a woman, but loose enough to show you're a lady; Show some leg once in a while, and use a bit of mascara and lipstick;It wasn't a sin for a woman to use the face and figure God gave you to get ahead in life, as long as it was legal.\n And one of the most important secrets of womanhood: we all have animated faces at a shoe sale!So now that we have the chic lit firmly established, let's move on to the drama. A massive explosion over the Beaufort river flowing through, yes, Beaufort, South Carolina.Reclusive Edith Heyward witnessed this event in 1955 from her bedroom window in the old mansions. And Edith passed away with a secret firmly buried in her backyard. Now it was 2014 and Merrit was the new owner, after Cal, her husband, was killed in a fire in Maine, where they lived and he worked as a firefighter. He was Edith's grandson. Then Loralee arrived, all the way from McDonough, Georgia, with young Owen holding her one hand, while her other hand clasped the handbag holding her pink Journal of Truths. Loralee figured he wouldn't need his physical assets to get ahead one day. He wouldn't need to. With his mama's looks and his daddy's brains, he would do just fine. She was upset about the long red nail she broke when she shoved the last piece of luggage in the back of her Lincoln Navigator. She tried not to cry. It wasn't the biggest tragedy of the past year, just the latter in a long line.The last entry in her Journal of Truths before she left for Beaufort, South Carolina read: \n\nSometimes bravery can be just the face of desperation.\n\nNow, if you plan to read this book, remember this line. It is probably the most important one in the book. You can thank me later. And before you faint from shock, for the three star rating, given my dying annoyance with chic lit, let me set something straight. After battling through the woods of moss-covered chic lit clich\u00e9s, there is good mystery, a shocking secret, well told, waiting to be discovered. The third star is actually for  Gone With The Wind mentioned in the book. Yes, I read the book three times, and watched the movie probably a dozen times. The ending made me do it. The best ever.You can skip the ending if you want. Like all formulaic, romance novels, this one doesn't waver from the expected ending... you know, that mechanically followed rule or style present in all of them. For the chic lit averters, like me, stop at chapter thirty. The rest of it is predictable meh. You won't miss a beat. For my darling romance friends, fasten your pink seat belts and wiggle those cutie toes with the dark pink nails in the high heels. Happily proceed. The ending will be worth your while. You will need your lipstick and mascara! And, oh yes, the rest of the box of tissues."}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy of The Sound of Glass. Three strangers with interconnected secrets come together in an old mansion in South Carolina. They all live under unresolved dark clouds which slowly get cleared up as the story progresses. I have a tolerance for the occasional sentimental and somewhat formulaic novel if the story, characters and setting pull me in. And this is what I was hoping for in The Sound of Glass, but it missed the mark in a couple of ways. The central secret that gets resolved at the end was a bit too odd for me and the story felt too long and dragged out. But there were a few pluses: the writing is good and even lovely at times, the sense of place and what it would feel like to live in South Carolina is potent, and one of the characters -- Lorelei -- is truly awesome in her wisdom and generosity. And the book deals with domestic violence without trivializing or overdramatizing the issue. For all these reasons, I suspect The Sound of Glass will appeal to many people. But it didn't quite work for me -- I didn't feel pulled in."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "Southern families and families with secrets.After her husband died, Merritt le\u200bft their home in Maine and headed to South Carolina to Cal's grandmother's home\u200b that she \u200bhad inherited\u200b.

The death of Edith's husband had an enormous impact on her life for more than one reason. After his death, Edith raised her only son C. J. alone, and he had a temper just like his father. C. J.'s son, Cal, married Merritt and took the temper with him to his marriage.Merri\u200btt\u200b is a bit unlikeable because she just couldn't relax and trust anyone, but who would after she knew no one even knew she existed. When her half brother\u200b, Owen,\u200b and \u200bher step-mother, Loralee, unexpectedly arrive at the house and plan on staying, secrets come out, and the story heats up with the secrets of the house and of the characters as they find clues about the house and each other's lives. Merritt became more likeable and caring as the book continued.Loralee is a bit overbearing, but means well and is very loving. \u200bShe definitely has a secret and a reason for moving in with Merritt. \u200bOwen is precocious and a nerd, but very pleasant and sweet and tries to bring Merritt out of her shell.\u200bGibbs, Cal's brother, was likable and helpful. He knew secrets about his brother and the house their grandmother lived in. The attic and its contents were the biggest secret his grandmother had and one that caused the most excitement and questions. Would Merritt find out what was meant by what was left in the attic and why Cal\u2019s grandmother did what she did up there?Did the house hold the family secrets, did the characters hold the family secrets, or did both the house and the characters hold the secrets that had been kept under wraps for years?\u200b To me both the house and the characters were fragile just like Edith\u2019s glass wind chimes.THE SOUND OF GLASS is another remarkable, beautiful book by Karen White. Her descriptions of the characters, the scenes, and the emotions of the characters are very real. The book kept me wondering just what some of the female characters had to hide and why they were the way they were.The characters will grow on you and grow on each other in a warm, inviting way. You will need some tissues as this wonderful story wraps up. THE SOUND OF GLASS has suspense and mystery as well as addressing the issue of domestic violence. I truly enjoyed THE SOUND OF GLASS, and if you have ever read one of Ms. White\u2019s books, you know you will be in for a marvelous read. \u200bI hope you get to read the book and enjoy it too.\u200b It is oh so good.

I've rated her books from 3-5 stars but they have all been good from start to finish. Her newest one, The Sound of Glass, is no exception. I was completely taken in by it from the moment I began reading it. Love, relationships--some good, some bad, power of forgiveness, and the strength to move on. That's what this book was in a nutshell. I liked the characters, especially Loralee. A woman who wouldn't give up and lived by her mama's words of wisdom. To be honest, she made me cry. A lot of sadness in this novel but I did have moments where I smiled. I am glad I was alone when I cried, though--my husband always looks at me funny when I'm crying over a book.

The mansion that Merritt inherited was an intriguing setting for a story and there was the mystery of the suitcase. That part I liked. BUT, I just could not stand Loralee, her step mother that ends up moving into the mansion. She was incredibly irritating. I can't relate to a woman who focuses so much on outer appearance, it's a trait that I find shallow and unappealing. Shouldn't a woman be more focused on her inner beauty? I did not like her pushy attitude and the way she was trying to change Merritt and the way she dressed. It is okay to embrace your natural beauty. You don't need makeup to be attractive. And then of course she is the queen of wisdom, always referring to her Journal of Truths, which I did not find to be all that wise. This story revolves heavily around domestic abuse and it was overdone and unrealistic. Every character was either a victim of domestic abuse or an orphan. It made the story a tad bit unbelievable. I do see a lot of positive reviews for this book so perhaps this is another case of \"It's me and not you.\" ARC was provided by the publisherFollow us on KT Book ReviewsTwitterFacebookPinterest"}, {"userName": "Kelly Ingram", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16504557-kelly-ingram", "userReview": "I'm sorry to say that the Sound of Glass resembled more the sound of grass growing. The pace of the book was excruciatingly slow with bits of folk wisdom thrown in and endless similes - in fact it was like being stuck in a traffic jam as cars slow down to look at a wreck. Add in the Journal of Truths being recorded by one character with such profound bits like \"Only quitters quit\" and you're left with something better suited to a Lifetime movie. The story dealt with the very serious subject of domestic abuse, but the scenario of the story was so improbable, it was impossible to sympathize with any character. Every main character was not only a victim of domestic abuse, but also an orphan. There were more orphans in this story than in a Disney movie. Those people must have been drawn to each other - like flies to honey.

Cal had steadfastly refused to talk about his origins, leaving his widow with no idea about Cal\u2019s late parents, younger brother, or the reclusive grandmother, Edith Heyward, who left him the sprawling estate in the Carolina Lowlands. Likewise, Merritt had never confided in him how she\u2019d broken off with her airline-pilot father when he\u2019d married a seductive blonde, big-haired airline stewardess just five years her senior.A Yankee through and through, Merritt is as self-contained as a maple tree \u2014 and as out of place in Beaufort, S.C., as such a tree would be amongst magnolia trees, honeysuckle, and saw grass. She bristles at the pushiness, loquaciousness, and flirtatiousness of her sexy step-mother Loralee Connors, now widowed, who simply shows up with her owlish 10-year-old son Owen in tow. Merritt and her brother-in-law, Dr. Gibbes Heyward, loathe one another at sight. (He\u2019s the spitting image of Cal naturally, as this is chick-lit, after all.) And all of those constantly tinkling wind chimes made of sea glass strewn all around the house and grounds seem ready to make Merritt go mad! Southern mansions and deep, dark secrets go together like pralines and cream, and The Sound of Glass proves no exception. The tale is told alternately by Merritt, Loralee, and Merritt\u2019s beleaguered grandmother-in-law, Edith Heyward. Merritt discovers that her husband Cal wasn\u2019t the only Heyward harboring dangerous secrets, and readers will have lots of fun guessing and discovering just what those were.I\u2019d read Karen White\u2019s The House on Tradd Street, a so-so Southern Gothic tale of ghosts with unfinished business, but I enjoyed this one much, much more. Grief-struck Merritt Heyward struck me as a more well-rounded character than The House on Tradd Street\u2019s Melanie Middleton; except for the eternally perky Loralee Connors, all of the characters in the book seemed believable. (Still, I think readers will, like me, develop a soft spot for Loralee despite her over-the-top persona.) I hope that White will spin us a sequel so that we can get to see more of Merritt Heyward and her family.In the spirit of full disclosure, I received this ebook free from NetGalley and NAL in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie", "userReview": "I love a good story and I love the South.

Coming to terms with her past is not on her to-do list. So when she finds she has inherited her late husbands' grandmothers' family home in South Carolina, she embraces the opportunity to escape her past.

Love the stunning front cover! THE SOUND OF GLASS  by talented Karen White is an emotional multi-generational southern Gothic tale of mystery, secrets, crime, guilt, abuse, and lies; mixed with humor, wit, romance, and much needed healing. No one can tell it better than the \"southern queen\"--buried secrets, history, and mysterious attics.  When all the secrets come to the surface, someone is \"bound\" to learn something, and be a better person for them. As the story opens we hear from Edith Heyward Beaufort, SC in 1955, with her three year old son CJ when a plane crashes with sirens, screams, tragedy, and death. Edith notices a brown leather suitcase that sat upright in her garden as if an uninvited visitor had suddenly come to call, which must have been from the plane crash. However, between the nicely folded clothes, she found no toiletry kit. There was however a note. A note she will take to her grave. She begins to wonder  about its owner, possibly a business traveler? She had an inquisitive mind, as the only child of a widower police detective, she had never known any other way to be. So when the handsome lawyer Calhoun Heyward had come to her small town of Walterboro to try a case, she hadn\u2019t known that she would have been better off pretending to be a simpering female without opinions. Because in the end, that was what he really wanted. Deep in her thoughts - a few seconds later, two policemen are at her door giving her news of her husband.Next, we jump to Merritt Heyward, 2014, a curator for a small art museum in Maine, moving to Beaufort, SC. She is not a happy person. She had been married to Cal which had been dead for two years and he had never spoken of his family or Beaufort in the seven years they were married. The Heyward\u2019s were an old Beaufort family, since the Revolution. Cal\u2019s grandmother left him the Greek Revival home. Now it is hers and the Beaufort Heritage Society is interested in acquiring the property for a house museum. She soon discovers Edith was a recluse and no one had been in the house in two decades\u2014about the time Cal left. She also left Gibbs a generous sum, while she left all the contents to Cal, since he was the eldest. She was unaware Cal even had a brother, ten years younger than Cal, a pediatrician in Beaufort.The next character, which will make you smile is Loralee Purvis Connors, a former flight attendant for Delta, thirty-six years old from McDonough, GA. She has learned three main truths about life: \"Time was a slippery thing, pain was temporary, and death wasn\u2019t something to be afraid of.\"\u201cShe knew growing up dirt poor did not mean you had to stay that way and it wasn\u2019t a sin to use the face and figure God gave you to get ahead in life, as long as it was legal.\u201c She also writes in her Journal of Truths, (loved it) which she will give to her son Owen one day. With his mama\u2019s looks and his daddy\u2019s brains, he would do just fine. Robert her pilot `husband is long gone and now they are on their way to see Robert\u2019s daughter from his first marriage, to allow Owen to get acquainted with his step sister, Merritt. Lucky, they will be headed to South Carolina, which is better than Maine any day of the week. When Loralee shows up  on Merritt\u2019s doorstep with Owen, the last thing she wants is this southern belle with her non-stop chatty talking, her quirky southern phrases, her journal, and her ten year old geeky son Owen (now called Rocky). Merritt wants to be left alone. They are total opposites. However, Loralee knows Merritt is lost and is one of those people who thinks they have to live with their toes pressed against disaster and comes to expect it. \"After all Merritt deserves a good hissy fit before she lays more hurt at her feet.\" There is much mystery  surrounding each of the characters-how are they connected? Slowly we hear from the past, versus present as all the pieces come together, re-uniting of an odd sisterhood, survivors, a tragedy, and sometimes revenge. The lives of each, as they learn from one another; for a poignant and moving story which will warm your heart. With wind chimes and beautiful sea glass\u2014mermaid tears, through beatings, storms, and weather -standing the test of time without crumbling, becoming even more beautiful. With laughs and tears, a family joined by love as they break free from the past, and chains which have held them.I loved all of Loralee\u2019s (a true southern belle) wisdom and inspiration from her Journal. Some of my favorites: \u201cThe weight of fear goes away as soon as we face our monsters and realize they weren\u2019t as scary as we thought.\u201d\u201cThose who refuse to acknowledge the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d\u201cSoutherners would talk a subject to death, until it lay gasping and panting in the dust.\u201d\"Sugar, your clothes should always be tight enough to show that you\u2019re a woman, but loose enough to how that you\u2019re a lady.\u201d\u201cEven the blackest darkness, there is always light shining somewhere.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been dealt a tough deck of cards, that\u2019s for sure, but it\u2019s time to pull up your big-girl panties and move on.

Surely I\u2019m not the only one who just couldn\u2019t get into this book?! Maybe I\u2019m just not in the mood for it. Either way I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be giving this one another shot. It didn\u2019t help that I was completely confused when Edith\u2019s husband (Cal\u2019s grandfather) had the same name as Cal \u2013 Calhoun. I completely got Edith and Merritt mixed up in the first few chapters. The author does include the dates at the beginning of the chapters but I wasn\u2019t interested enough to remember."}, {"userName": "Kirsten ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten", "userReview": "This is (I estimate) a 6-12 kleenex book. It is also an intensely uncomfortable yet cathartic tale. I usually am not a big fan of domestic melodramas, which this book definitely is. I also tend to avoid books set in the Deep South as they tend to celebrate the beauty of the culture, and gloss over the big warts of Southern life.That being said, this is a deeply affecting tale with engaging characters that pop off the page. (Well, in my case, they popped off the audio.) The multiple narrators and the depth of the mystery from the past were also very good.I highly recommend this. (Go Set a Watchman had better be really good to meet the bar set by this book.)"}, {"userName": "Susan Crowe", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4036154-susan-crowe", "userReview": "This was an exceptional book!

I really hate to give a bad review when I chose to read an advanced copy, but I have to be honest. This novel annoyed me very much and I couldn't wait to finish it.I know I'm supposed to be sympathetic to these women who are abused by their husbands including protagonist Merritt. I'm not against that kind of chick-lit and I usually enjoy it, but this novel is too formulaic and overdone to be believable.Loralee irritated me so much I nearly stopped reading several times. I just don't agree with White's idea of how women should be. I don't like women who care so much about appearance. I strongly believe that each woman should have her own idea of beauty. If someone wants to wear make-up, it's fine by me, but just don't force it to me. I really don't want to be criticized by a woman who wears heavy make-up and high-heels all the time. I love natural looking women, and respect men who love natural looking women.I felt I was constantly criticized whenever Loralee talked about Merritt's appearance. Her constant wisdom offering was even worse. I totally hate it when people do that. We women have enough of it in our life. I don't think it's kindness as White portraits in the novel. Do we need to be slim and have long legs, and start wearing a mini dress and lipsticks in order to be loved like Merritt? I don't think this story empowers women who are actually abused. For that reason, I can't give a good review.P.S. I had a strong urge to tell White that people in New England do eat watermelons although it's very hard to find ones with seeds now a days. I wonder people in south still prefer eating watermelon with seeds..."}, {"userName": "Terri Jacobson", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8370501-terri-jacobson", "userReview": "Karen White is a prolific writer, and she is known as a good storyteller. Her new novel, The Sound of Glass, just did not make a good impression on me. I felt the story was obvious and the writing mediocre. I felt one of the characters was just sappy, throwing out a lot of cliches in a simpering manner. I became very impatient with this character. The other main character was rigid and closed off. The story was about these two characters coming to know and accept each other. (There is also a 10 year old boy in the story, and this character entranced me; he is the reason I'm giving the book 2 stars.) For me, this book was a disappointing reading experience."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10894220-lisa", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading this book. It started off with a mysterious plane crash in the 50's and continues through today. It is about the families involved, the abuse of the women(not graphic) in their marriages, and brings us to today. It is about letting it go and moving on. The protagonist, Merritt, has inherited a house in SC through her husband's family. She goes south to start a new life and to heal some old wounds. Also enters her southern stepmother who has quite a wide range of \"wisdom\", her half brother and her brother-in-law."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1418580-wendy", "userReview": "What a great book!"}, {"userName": "joyce g", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53140602-joyce-g", "userReview": "I have spent a great deal of time in Beaufort, S.C. long before it became kind of a cool place where the homes were all brought back to life.

Anything that can happen does, but I was more than willing to go along for the ride. The Sound of Glass isn't highbrow literature, but it isn't trying to be. If you like your beach reads to have a whisper of disaster and crime (but with twists you can easily spot coming), this is the book for you.
