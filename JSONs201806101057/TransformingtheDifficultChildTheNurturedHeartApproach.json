Since I started reading this book, I have stopped feeling so hopeless and frustrated when trying to parent him because I now know the best way to deal with him. The book has altered my perspective and I'm now seeing and commenting on good things he is doing, rather than the wrong. I think he is feeling all the positive energy...that he has been needing all along. This feels like a much better parenting approach...of all children. Really grateful to have stumbled across this book!"}, {"userName": "Ellis Amdur", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37919812-ellis-amdur", "userReview": "There is Pollyanna sweetness to this book that drives me up the wall (hence, the 4 star rating). BUT, it is, nonetheless, a wonderful resource for families who have children with behavioral problems. The approach focuses on kids earning points to get privileges, but NOT gold stars that are meaningless. Points are used so that the child becomes responsible for earning all the good things in life through good behavior. It has the best way of imposing consequences that I\u2019ve ever seen, taking into account the requirements, legal and otherwise, that face a 21st century parent. Finally, this approach is a great way to start when the parents have had difficulty with anger in their own right. Most parents with anger difficulties are frustrated, unskilled, or feel profoundly incompetent to change their miserable situation with their kids, whom they, nonetheless, love. This approach gives the parents a \u201ctoolbox\u201d so that they know what to do. They learn to set limits and discipline, and give their kids something up-to-now lacking \u2013 real guidance and leadership. Again, the tone can easily make the reader thing that this book is a \u201cliberal,\u201d \u2013 let the children have their way \u2013 type of book, but read on. It is quite the opposite. It offers parents a chance to be really strong, really clear on values, and openly loving at the same time. In particular, this will prove very useful for parents of children who have the justifiably controversial diagnoses of ADHD, Oppositional-Defiant Disorder, Intermittent Explosive Disorder - these diagnoses that are all-to-often - adjectives that describe kids who don't conform to others' wishes, in school or home. Before I would ever allowed my child to receive any medication for so-called behavioral disorders, I would definitely use the information in this book - I've used it to work with a number of parents with very beneficial effects."}, {"userName": "Tryn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn", "userReview": "This is a book that one frazzled parent recommends to another. A friend recommended it to me and I recommended it to my sister and another friend, when they called to chat about kids. I\u2019ve read a lot of parenting books over the years, but this is the most practical, confidence-inspiring one I\u2019ve encountered so far. The title, however, is misleading and probably steers too many parents away who would actually benefit from reading it. The very practical, specific advice in this book would be helpful for any parent raising any child. I don\u2019t consider any of my children \u201cdifficult\u201d but what I learned in this book is useful to me on a daily basis. It really comes down to the energy we give to our children. Children seek out our energy. If they don\u2019t get enough of it, they will demand it with bad behavior. We can give them our energy in a positive form or a negative form\u2014light or dark. When we affirm and appreciate them, we strengthen them internally. When we strategically place the rope like the trainers for Shamoo do when teaching a killer whale to jump, then we help them to experience success built upon success.I\u2019ve been hesitant to use praise and rewards with my children because I do not want them to be focussed on those things, but this book shows me how to use them in appropriate ways that are more about appreciation and earning privileges. I need to read this book again."}, {"userName": "The Badger", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34508706-the-badger", "userReview": "Nurtured Heart definitely works, but it seems to be an offshoot of Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) and the Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE) approach. While Nurtured Heart is expensive and time consuming to teach to all staff members in a school or facility, CARE can be taught in a couple one-hour staff meetings. Nurtured Heart is aimed at educators, but fails to take into account the other people children see during their usual day: the custodian, the clerk, the bus driver, their PARENTS! PCIT and CARE make sure these people are also trained."}, {"userName": "Mistiemae1 Downs", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3421271-mistiemae1-downs", "userReview": "I was given this book to read after finally visiting a child psychologist to get help dealing with my very intense, difficult son. I was extremely skeptical and resistant at first, but after implementing just the first step of the Nurtured Heart Approach, I saw instant improvement in my child. This in turn gave me confidence that I needed to continue on my parenting journey in a positive, heartfelt direction.Do not be put off by the title. Though the book is specifically geared towards the \"difficult\" child, the results you will see with an average child are just as wonderful! We have four children and implemented the ideas across the board. I am now sure that each of my children is getting the attention they need from me each day.The Nurtured Heart Approach itself is divided into simple, easily implementable steps that any dedicated parent can do with just a few minutes each day. Each chapter will give the reader additional information and encouragement for each step along the way. There are also chapters and an appendix relating to crossing the boundary from home to school, where many intense children struggle most."}, {"userName": "Molly Ricks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2110783-molly-ricks", "userReview": "I've been reading this book slowly, implementing each step as I learn about it.

I have started using the positive focus and video tape moments with my students. It occurs to me that this really is rewarding and worthwhile for all kids. And really, all adults. What can it hurt to honestly tell someone that they're doing things well? Plus it is affirming to take time to focus on what is going well in my class instead of losing sight of that in constant battle with things that are a bit--ah--off.I take issue with the idea that filling out the little eval sheets is only 30 seconds of effort on behalf of teachers. The reality is that it's a LOT of effort for the kid to remember to share the sheet and even more effort if the teacher has to get involved with reminders, etc. I feel pretty ADHD myself in the course of a day teaching 7th graders. Little \"low effort\" sheets like the on described are surprisingly difficult to deal with in the hustle and bustle of the classroom.Still, if I could figure out a way to work it in to my day, I'd love to do this with about 6 or 7 students in my class. I believe, as Glasser says, that the number of kids needing this kind of intervention is only going to increase, so I really appreciate his giving me a possible \"tool\" to work with my kids. He is totally right that at the moment, mainstreaming is often very exclusionary. It bothers me to think that this is happening in my classroom and I really hope that with the NHA, I can start to turn this around and make all of my kids active, engaged learners in our classroom community."}, {"userName": "Catherine Gillespie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39785846-catherine-gillespie", "userReview": "I read Transforming the Difficult Child: The Nurtured Heart Approach after seeing it recommended as a resource for calm and effective parenting (particularly about getting kids through their homework without fuss, although the book is more comprehensive than just that!). It took me a bit to get past the title. I don\u2019t refer to my children as \u201cdifficult,\u201d nor do I find that title helpful even in kids who are difficult. The authors use the term \u201cintense\u201d in a couple of places, and I wish they would have stuck with that in the title too. In fact, I think the title could be off-putting to parents like me whose kids are basically great but sometimes have bad behavior. That said, the authors note that their methods are applicable to all kids, not just \u201cdifficult\u201d ones.Once I got past the title, I found some helpful information. Some of these ideas have been in other books I\u2019ve read\u2013putting energy into positive affirmation rather than giving attention only to negative behaviors, etc\u2013but this book gave detailed examples that helped me think through how to implement the ideas with my elementary-aged kids.{Read my full review here}"}, {"userName": "Dorothy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7924493-dorothy", "userReview": "After taking a new job as Day Treatment Facilitator for Treatment Resistant Children and working for about a month, frustrated and ready to call it quits, I found this book, read it in it's entirety in one weekend, went back to work on Monday, started applying the techniques and immediately saw changes.

Kids who were doomed to become placed on Psychotropic Medications and/or Institutionalized have made strides in the program.

They have some combination of low attention, low empathy, attraction to risk, and high energy that makes them an exhausting and sometimes embarrassing undertaking. I've attended Dr. Glasser's classes, which cover much of the same material here in this book, and he does a great job of pointing out that these personality attributes don't have to be negative -- but they do have to be managed differently.The techniques do work! However, with any unconventional approach that gives real results (like various diets), the problem is in sustaining the system, which (because traditional parenting hasn't been working) doesn't feel \"normal\", which can then lead to lapses and \"refresher courses\" every so often. Still, like diets, this doesn't mean it's not worth doing. They are effective, but not simple."}, {"userName": "Aspidistra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173608-aspidistra", "userReview": "What I mostly got from this book was a better understanding of the emotional dynamics between parent and child when a child is acting out. It helped me to see some counterintuitive ways that I could help my child (and myself) gain self-control. This is not a book specifically for adoptive parents, but many adoptive parents of older children may find it helpful.The book recommends eventually instituting a very structured points system for helping a child to gain privileges or treats from good behavior. I think this would work well for many kids, but it was too complicated and too punitive for mine. Nevertheless, we have adopted some of these methods in a more informal way with great success."}, {"userName": "Janis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/885699-janis", "userReview": "Can I just say 'wow!' I have read many parenting books and have felt they all had merit, but never successfully implemented the ideas presented. This book, while just read and not implemented yet, has the most promising premise for parenting I have ever read. While written for parents of 'difficult' children, I think it would work for any child and possibly any adult that you interact with often. How can you go wrong with focusing on the positives, no matter how small? We all need positive reinforcement, and this book has the answers for how to do it. Finally! I'm still a little intimidated by the process--any change is difficult--but I actually feel a lot of hope for helping all my children to succeed in life."}, {"userName": "Christina Zable", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/542371-christina-zable", "userReview": "Recommended by Rachel Gollub. The upshot of this book is, give as much of your praise and energy as you can to your kids when they're doing what you want, and as little energy as possible when they aren't. We're applying this in our family and, I think, seeing some positive results. Four stars instead of five because the book is very booster-ish and pleased with itself, and because I could have used more details on what to do with unwanted behaviors than just \"ignore them\" (e.g. when my kid is tantruming in a public place I can't just turn my back) and on how to build the skills needed for positive behaviors."}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872978-sandi", "userReview": "I don't agree with everything in the book, but it has made a big difference in how I correct my 11 yo son's behavior and his response to correction. I would recommend it for every parent of an Autistic child for sure, and for parents of difficult children as well. I wish it were possible for teachers to adapt this model in public schools, but it is so different that I don't think it would work with all children in class and would take so much time of the regular classroom teacher, but I think it would give them something to think about as far as dealing with difficult children.

A child's well-being, after all, is at stake!I might add, the book's title is a bit misleading because the book isn't necessarily about difficult children, but rather about parents who ought find a better way to deal with certain childlike personalities.
