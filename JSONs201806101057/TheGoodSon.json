It's a claustrophobic, tense and surprising tale of a few days in the life of a twenty-six-year-old male student. Yu-jin, awakes one day, in his home, afraid that he\u2019s had a seizure. He's clearly had these before and feels that this might account for his feelings of disorientation. What happened the night before? He can't recall. He's soon to discover the surprising truth. But not everything is quite as it seems, as we are to find out.Set in South Korea, there's an element of things feeling slightly \u2018off\u2019 from the start. I do like translated fiction as the books tend to highlight differences in culture and behaviour that I find fascinating. The stories are inclined to surprise me as the feel of the narrative is somehow subtly altered by the different way people relate to each other and the off-centre (to me) way the characters live their daily lives. That said, this is crime fiction and therefore the core of the tale should be familiar - shouldn\u2019t it? Well, no. Not in this case, at least.As Yu-jin explores the apartment he shares with his mother he quickly discovers one surprise after another. These trigger memories \u2013 or rather partial memories \u2013 of a few words spoken here and there and some actions taken by him the previous night. But the picture still doesn\u2019t knit together, nothing seems to make sense. What the hell has happened here?We begin to learn more as flashbacks to Yu-jin\u2019s early life are interspersed with present day activity. The plot thickens as we discover more about the relationship he shared with his mother and then of a father and brother too. This is a psychological thriller that teases and shocks and saddens. And then, towards the end, as I began to see the pieces coming together and I thought I had worked out how it would all be resolved, I realised that I was wrong. It\u2019s a gripping tale that held me totally in its grasp throughout. If you\u2019re a fan of this type of story, then please do give this one a try. It\u2019s different, and I mean that in a very good way.My sincere thanks to Little, Brown Book Group for supplying a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "The Good Son is a novel that rewards it\u2019s readers \u2013 a slow burner of a tale, creepy as you like, based around one single character \u2013 Yu-jin \u2013 who wakes up one morning and finds himself covered in blood and his Mother dead downstairs\u2026but did he kill her? Well that is the question\u2026.Yu-jin has his problems. Epileptic, frequently off his meds, suffering from fugue states, he explores his memory, his past and his present trying to discover his truth. His story gets ever darker and more chilling\u2026the further you read into this the creepier it gets, the prose is tight, controlled and ultimately quite scary, this is a brilliantly observant character study that keeps you on your toes.The Good Son is subtle in its twisty nature, this is not a novel with a sudden hit of reveal, it is a meander to judgment along an ever darker path, as such it is cleverly nuanced, this was not a story that I pegged the ending of early. In fact it is slippery, hard to grasp onto and somewhat ingenious.It won\u2019t be for everyone that\u2019s for sure. Early on you wonder if you can stick with Yu-jin but I recommend you do.

How is that relationship built between reader and storyteller?Told through flashbacks, memory slips, fantasies, hallucinations, and journal entries, You-Jeong Jeong\u2019s The Good Son is a Korean thriller with a most unreliable narrator. College student Yu-Jin has woken up covered in blood and his morning gets more puzzling, dark, and creepy when he finds his mother with her throat cut at the bottom of the stairs.Living his life in a muddled cloud because of medication for epilepsy, he decided to stop taking his pills four days ago. With stopping cold turkey comes memory loss and other costly side effects, and he can\u2019t recall his actions of the past twenty-four hours. Yu-Jin starts to try to recreate the previous night using evidence in the apartment, and his mother\u2019s journal. Some of the blanks start to fill up, and more is revealed about his and his family\u2019s mangled past. As Yu-Jin slowly discovers that he may be the culprit, he begins to see he has three options: confess, run, or cover it up\u2026Jeong\u2019s novel is most distinguished by the unique narrator. Yu-Jin is untrustworthy, manipulating, and dismissive of most things the reader wants him to concentrate on. This creates a good frustration, the type that propels a plot and makes us turn pages. And while I won\u2019t give anything up, about halfway through, the other shoe drops. A huge shoe! I also warn you: There is blood. Lots of it. Graphic pails of blood.The Good Son is a thriller that takes the reader down a dark hole, deep in the human psyche. I did find some of the the analysis of every detail of the past 24-hours a bit repetitive, and parts of the plot were predictable. But I would still recommend this one for the original and intense storytelling that you will make you squirm, yet still keep you reading and reading.Thank you to NetGalley, Penguin Books, and You-Jeong Jeong for the advance copy for review."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Moffat", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5858624-elizabeth-moffat", "userReview": "First of all, thank you so much to Grace Vincent and Little, Brown publishers for providing me with a digital copy of this astounding novel from \"the Korean Stephen King,\" in exchange for an honest review. When Grace first emailed me and I read the comparison to King above, well of course I had to have it! As a die-hard Constant Reader (King fan) anything that is compared to my all-time favourite author, I have to check out. Now, I normally hate comparisons to other books or authors but this one I didn't mind so much. I think because it was compared to King and my expectations are astronomically high when it comes to him, I was too curious to see how You-jeong Jeong would measure up. And did she? Well, I would say absolutely yes. However, I feel like her novel stood completely on its own as a twisted, dark tale that wasn't reminiscent of King's work in my opinion, but a great example of a unique author with an individual, quirky style.I don't want to go too deep into the synopsis as I believe the one above taken from Goodreads describes this novel more than adequately without me giving any more detail. In fact, this is one of those books where you've got to be incredibly careful exactly what you say, because you could be giving away major spoilers. However, never fear, I'm not one to be doing that and I will be as deliberately vague as possible. Set in South Korea, we have our unreliable narrator, Yu-jin who finds his mother's lifeless body at the bottom of the stairs in his house and has no memory of the previous nights events, apart from going running late at night. Our male lead has suffered with seizures and memory loss for as long as he can remember and although he is on tablets that are meant to control/stop his episodes, he goes for periods where he doesn't take them at all as taking the medication gives him debilitating headaches. As the narrative continues, we get glimpses into Yu-jin's childhood and the present day as he attempts to remember what happened to his mother as ever so slowly, the memories start trickling back.I was very worried about writing this review but I'm relieved to realise that as soon as I sat down, everything I wanted to say (without giving away major spoilers) just managed to flow (PHEW!). I was hugely impressed by this novel and it's one that has continued to stay with me, despite having read it a few weeks ago now. I think this is for a number of reasons - first, the unreliable narrator, secondly, the brutality of the story and thirdly, the multiple surprises that are round every corner. The way in which the information is fed to you by the author is nothing short of spectacular and you become desperate to discover exactly what's going on in Yu-Jin's head and what has occurred in his past to get him to the situation in which he finds himself at the beginning of the story. It's not a story for the faint-hearted, I have to say. There is violence, graphic and shocking details of this violence and characters that crawl under your skin, give you goosebumps and make you shiver.This novel starts as a slow burner but please don't let that put you off. You-jeong Jeong expertly builds and weaves all the necessary parts of this jigsaw puzzle of a story piece by piece. This is absolutely necessary in my opinion to construct a tense and creepy atmosphere where you'll be glad certain characters in this story exist only in this book, it's that terrifying.For my full review and many more, please visit my blog at http://www.bibliobeth.com"}, {"userName": "Ova Incekaraoglu", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5316099-ova-incekaraoglu", "userReview": "This was a brilliant and unique read.

Thriller readers used to the spare prose and constant rewards of your typical US thrillers will have to adjust to getting their reveals over the course of several pages of long flashbacks without any of the typical cues or pacing. But this isn't a bad thing! You have to work a little bit in this book rather than getting spoon-fed.Readers also won't find as much mystery here as they'd expect. The question is not really who committed a crime (it becomes apparent pretty quickly) the question is why. More than that, the question of the book is who Yu-jin is. As a narrator he doesn't give you much to go on. Though after a while you realize that he has told you who he is all along the way, you just didn't realize it.Something about the fit of me and the prose was not quite right, but it's impossible to say whether it's the translation or the author.

She is often compared to Stephen King.\" I suspect most readers will be pulled in by the Stephen King comparison, whereas for me the attraction of the novel is the Korean angle, as a fan of Korean literary fiction. In that regard I am perhaps not the target audience for the book, as in pure literary terms, this is not, and does not purport to be, in the same class as Bae Suah, Han Kang or Hwang Sok-yong say.This is however a satisfyingly intense psychological thriller, not so much a whodunnit but a whydidhedoit, or in fact a whydidIdoit. The novel is narrated in the first person, over the course of a few days, by 25 year-old \ud55c\uc720\uc9c4 (Han Yu-jin), a former schoolboy champion swimmer now living with his widowed mother and Hae-jin his adopted brother (what happened to his father and his biological brother, being a crucial part of the narrative).The Korean title of the original novel is \uc885\uc758 \uae30\uc6d0, which is the Korean rendition of Darwin's The Origin of Species, and in the English version the title of the last section of the novel, as Yu-jin takes inspiration: \"Darwin\u2019s maxim came to mind: adapt or die\".The English version has been retitled The Good Son (I do wish publisher's wouldn't do this) and ably translated by Chi-Young Kim, perhaps best known as translated of Please Look After Mother as well as The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly.It opens with Yu-jin wakening in his house, confused and disorientated:\"The smell of blood woke me. It was intense, as though my whole body were inhaling it. It reverberated and expanded within me. Strange scenes flitted through my mind \u2013 the fuzzy yellow light of a row of street lamps in the fog, swirling water below my feet, a crimson umbrella rolling along a rain-soaked road, a plastic tarpaulin shrouding a construction site snapping in the wind. Somewhere a man was singing and slurring lyrics: a song about a girl he couldn\u2019t forget, and about her walking in the rain.\"We and he soon find out (no spoiler alert needed at this stage) that the smell of blood comes from his murdered mother's body:\"I looked back down at the razor in my hand. Clues to who had killed Mother were all over the place, including the decisive evidence of the murder weapon. Without a single clue pointing to a different conclusion, I would be implicated. How would Hae-jin take this? No matter what he asked me, I could only answer one way \u2013 I don\u2019t remember a thing. The time-worn excuse made by thousands of criminals over thousands of years.\"Yu-jin then gradually pieces together what must have happened, fills us (and himself as he discovers some secrets in his mother's diary) on his life to this point, and then decides what he must do to \"adapt or die\".One interesting note that may not be known by English readers is that the author took inspiration from a real-life case, that of \uc720\uc601\ucca0 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoo_You...). For example, the song Vangelis's \"Conquest of Paradise\" - on which Yu-jin's ipod playlist has stopped, allowing him to reconstruct a timeline of what had happened the night before - is a song that Yoo Young-chul listened to to psyche himself up before he embarked on his sprees.Thanks to Little, Brown Book Group, via Netgalley, for the ARC."}, {"userName": "Ova Incekaraoglu", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5316099-ova-incekaraoglu", "userReview": "This was a brilliant and unique read.

Through the situation Yu-jin finds himself in, he takes the reader on a journey as he tries to piece together the events in his life that led to this moment, the moment he wakes covered in blood, and equally important, how to survive this moment. The Good Son is dubbed as a thriller, but the thrills aren\u2019t found in the pacing, as this one is of a slower pace, the thrills come in the sinister revelations.The tension in this novel is created through Yu-jin\u2019s faulty memory, it created a heightened anxiety around our main protagonist because you\u2019re unsure whether you can trust him \u2013 how much of what he says is truth and how much is lies \u2013 we know Yu-Jin experiences a manic state, brought on by not taking his medication, what we don\u2019t know is how much he pushes the boundaries on reality during his memory recall.As the plot thickens, you\u2019re constantly wondering how Yu-jin is going to survive this. What\u2019s quite incredible about this book is how much of the time it\u2019s just you and Yu-jin, with very limited characters, you really get to know Yu-jin, and be prepared because he\u2019s walking a dark path. Not only is this book limited in characters, it\u2019s also limited in location, with much of the story taking place inside Yu-Jin\u2019s apartment, which he shares with his brother and mother. This creates an intense setting for this drama to play out, there is no reprieve from the tormented mind of Yu-Jin.As the narration switches between the past and the present, The Good Son provides an in-depth character study of Yu-jin, exploring his own psyche and his complex family relations. It\u2019s cleverly told, sharp [and bloody] in descriptive detail, made all the more chilling as it\u2019s inspired by a true story.*My thanks to the publisher for granting me access to a digital copy of this title via Netgalley*"}, {"userName": "Stephanie Jane (Literary Flits)", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31264299-stephanie-jane-literary-flits", "userReview": "See more of my book reviews on my blog, Literary FlitsI recently spotted Ova's The Good Son review on her blog Excuse My Reading which encouraged me to get to reading my ARC of this book sooner rather than later. It's narrated in the first person by Yu-jin who is a brilliantly unreliable narrator. A chilling character, he fascinated me (much like watching a snake) and loved the uncertainty of never knowing whether what I was discovering was The truth, his truth or whether he was spinning me a tale! The novel isn't particularly fast-paced, but it was always so tense that, for me, it felt like it flew by. I had to keep putting the book aside from time to time to make sure I had absorbed everything that was happening.The story spirals around key moments for Yu-jin and his family, each revisited with the reader having a little more information to help them gauge the real story. I was convinced I had sussed it out quite early on, but was very wrong. Twice! Thinking back over the story now, I would say potential readers might need to be wary of The Good Son for it's blood level. I'm often squeamish and there were a few scenes here that I slightly skim-read to avoid the strongest imagery. This is a psychological thriller that, for me at least, leant more towards horror than crime fiction.

Moreover, it's a work in translation, and You-jeong Jeong is described as one of the leading psychological crime fiction authors in South Korea.I don't read a lot of thrillers, and, in those rare cases that I do, I find it hard to review them without giving away major plot points. I find that, in most cases, there is not much to talk about in terms of themes and symbolism, so I can only judge these books based on whether they succeeds at what they essentially set out to do - to tell a thrilling and suspenseful story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.The Good Son is narrated in the first person by Yu-jin, a 25-year old college student and former swimming champion, who lives with his widowed mother and adopted brother Hae-jin, who in many ways resembles Yu-jin's deceased older brother. The book opens with Yu-jin waking up one day, covered in blood, and finding the body of his mother, who clearly has been murdered. We soon learn that Yu-jin suffers from a condition that requires him to use medication to prevent seizures an blackouts, but a side effect of the pills is that they make him lethargic, so he sometimes secretly goes for days without taking them. When he finds his murdered mother's body, he quickly realizes that he will become the prime suspect of the murder investigation, so he struggles to piece together what actually happened from the fragments of his memories and his mother's diary entries.I think that, even if you're not a crime fiction enthusiast, you might be able to guess, fairly accurately, how this story is going to unfold, based on just the few pieces of information provided in the synopsis. Despite the fact that this is thriller, I found the pacing of the book to be very slow, and, apart from some truly intense and chilling moments, I felt that the narrative was going in circles between each point when some new and exciting piece of information is revealed. I must admit that I wasn't particularly surprised by the revelations. The hints that are left throughout the book made it pretty obvious, however, I found the character of Yu-jin quite fascinating and convincing. From the very start, you get the sense that he might be an unreliable narrator, and I was intrigued to find out how he will react and deal with the unfolding situation. The story is set over the course of just a few days, and it feels like you are stuck in Yu-jin mind that gives the book a rather claustrophobic atmosphere.

Based on the reviews I read prior to picking this up, I was a little wary. There was a lot of \"it's a slow burn\" and \"you have to stick with it\" but this was not my experience of reading it at all.Yes, there's not a huge amount of action and it's a very intense look inside the head of someone who's clearly not quite right but I found it gripping from the very first page to the final edge of the seat conclusion. The premise intrigued me, that someone could awake covered in blood and discover the body of his mother brutally murdered and have a limited amount of time to figure out what happened before the scene is discovered and he gets the blame. It's told almost entirely from Yu-jin's point of view and I felt everything right along with him. The initial confusion, the fear, the frustration, the anger and the sadness as he tries to figure out exactly what happened to his mother and why he doesn't remember. The truth is uncovered but very slowly as Yu-jin discovers clues, makes discussions and remembers events from the night before but also further into the past and it quickly becomes clear that there was something not right in the relationship between mother and son.She initially seems overly controlling of a 25 year old man and he seems afraid of her but it isn't long before we find there could be a reason for this. I will say I wasn't necessarily surprised by what is revealed about our main character, his relationship with his mother and past events as the author leaves enough hints and clues along the way that it's pretty obvious.I was however completely fascinated by Yu-jin and desperate to know how it would end and what would happen to him. He admits very early on that he's a skilled liar so you know not to trust him but not knowing what he'll do next or how he'll react to certain situations had me drawn in completely.He is very believable and convincing and I found myself empathising with him even when I knew I shouldn't. I felt his frustration at being controlled and his lack of freedom and actually the whole book felt very claustrophobic.It's very limited in terms of both setting and characters with almost all of the story occurring in a short space of time within one apartment. It creates such a wonderfully dark and suspenseful atmosphere that I loved it.The focus is very much on Yu-jin but the other characters who feature, adopted brother Hae-jin, his mother, his Auntie and even the police are very well drawn so no matter how brief an appearance they make you get a real sense of them.I will admit I was a little disappointed by the ending (it's not bad, I just expected more) but overall I really loved this book and would recommend to anyone who loves a thriller that really gets into a characters head.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with an ARC.

But I\u2019ll put my neck on the line and tell you I loved it. This is predominantly a first person narrative, the archetypal unreliable narrator whose narrative becomes more reliable as we listen to his words and explanations.When a young man wakes up covered all over with sticky blood and discovers body of his mother, throat slit wide, at the bottom of the stairs, he realises that he can\u2019t remember the night before and so starts to piece together what he thinks must have happened.On the verge of telephoning the police, he suddenly realises that he will be viewed as the prime suspect \u2013 and resolves to take time to work out what really happened before telling anyone of his discovery.This then is the basis for You-jeong Jeong\u2019s all-consuming novel. This is a book a bit like an Escher drawing, the longer you look into it, the more depth and fascination you get from it until it slowly draws you into the difficult world of Yu-Jin, a 25 year old man who struggles against the constraints of his medication which he is taking to prevent epileptic fits.Once a promising award winning swimmer, Yu Jin has had to give up that life because of his epilepsy and the concerns his mother had about him following the fate of his father and brother who died some years ago in a drowning accident.The style of the book is fascinating. The writing is very concise and factual, I supposed this is what I might expect from a Korean novel, but in fact it is a style that hugely works in favour of the story.As Yu-Jin slowly pulls back the covers and lets us in to unpeel the layers of his life, the reader can feel empathy and sympathy for this young man and his over protective mother, but the longer he tells his story, the more you question whether this version is the one you should be believing. It is to the author\u2019s credit that she is able to build up our empathy and then tear it down with a chilling and suspenseful revelation of the facts behind the memories.Yu-Jin\u2019s mother has tried to be a good mother to her son; to protect him from the worst of his condition, but in doing so, she has condemned him to a life of medication which stops him from feeling like himself. He describes this as a suffocating existence where he is subject to restrictions that make it impossible for him to truly live his life.It is only when he discovers his mother\u2019s journal that we begin to see how this good mother has suffered in trying to keep her son away from the world and all its attractions. Behind Yu-Jin\u2019s truths are a whole set of alternative explanations and as the picture of his life reveals itself to us, we begin to understand the awful secrets and the devastating lies that have kept Yu-Jin a prisoner to the truth.The pace of the book is sometimes quite slow, but lends credibility to the revelations and as the action speeds up, so we come to understand more of the mother\u2019s dilemma.The stilted nature of the revelations serves to underline the fragmented truths that form Yu-Jin\u2019s memories and we watch with horror and revulsion as the whole story unfolds in a chilling and suspenseful narrative.This is a different kind of book in a style that I am not accustomed to and that only helped to make it gripping and utterly compelling.There\u2019s a lot to think about in this sad and sometimes horribly humorous story, but I could not put it down until I knew the whole desperate story."}, {"userName": "Estibaliz79", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5020972-estibaliz79", "userReview": "Thanks to Goodreads Giveaways and Penguin Books for providing me with an Advance Uncorrected Proof of this novel.... that I just finished, 3 days after it was officially released. Here is my honest review...\"A breathless, chilling psychological thriller by the bestselling Korean novelist 'rightly compared to Stephen King'\" (Die Zeit, Germany).I just picked this quote and praise to the novel to help me out to start with my review, because as we all know, comparison is the thief of joy. So every time I see an author being compared to Stephen King (which happens really very very often) or the likes of some other best seller master, I can't help but get suspicious and cautious about that book.I'm happy to say this one was a nice surprise of a reading, even if the analogy doesn't stand a chance. I mean, there was nothing there that made me think of King while I was reading... though I guess you could see the ever lightest shade of 'The Dead Zone' now and then, regarding some themes. Still, the story holds together brilliantly and sure is a gripping one.Then, the second reason why I picked that quote has to do with the gender in which people keep classifying this novel: thriller, generally speaking, though it is actually more correct to talk about psychological thriller indeed.Psychological being the key word here, as one can say the whole plot and narrative structure revolves around the psychological aspect of the main character, as well as the psychological aspects of the main events unfolding page after page, both in the past and present time.Therefore, this is not the typical fast paced thriller than fans of the gender normally enjoy... which, funny enough, is also the reason why it gets a high rating from me (3.75), since everyone that knows me is very aware of the fact I don't like that kind of stories, where everything is cliche after cliche and running around and shooting and the old drill.So yes: as many reviews on this one have already stated, 'The Good Son' is a slow burner. And I wouldn't say is specially original or innovative regarding its concept or approach. The scenery is very very limited, and though the shocks are well dosed, it won't exactly make your jaw drop. Still, You-jeong Jeong is a great storyteller, capable of managing a good first person narrative, that keeps you turning the pages while enjoying the shiver.So do that. Enjoy."}, {"userName": "Erica (ricci.reads)", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51190658-erica-ricci-reads", "userReview": "The first of the authors four novels to be translated from Korean to English, 'The Good Son'\u00a0is a psychological thriller featuring an unreliable narrator that is apparently\u00a0inspired by a true story.It begins with\u00a0Yu-Jin awakening one morning, with no recollection of what has happened the night before, to find the dead body of his mother downstairs. Over the course of a few days, we follow\u00a0Yu-Jin fulfilling dual roles as both potential suspect and also detective as he tries to piece together what has happened. Using fragments of his own memories that gradually come back to him and also with the help of information that he finds in his mother's journals, the findings are as much a mystery to him and they are to the reader. This is an interesting take on this genre and probably what I enjoyed most about 'The Good Son'. My biggest issue with it was the writing style in the beginning, which was somewhat stunted, which is perhaps a translation issue rather than an issue with the authors writing? I'm unsure.However, this does lessen as we progress with the story, which is actually somewhat of a slow burner considering it's classified as a thriller. The plot really picks up in the second half where some scenes are quite electrifying to read and I really wish there had been more of that. The author has a gift for writing scenes of pursual - the novel and indeed Yu-Jin, as befitting his character, really comes to life during these moments. Events up until that point were more centred on a lot of Yu-Jin's internal monologue, a fair bit of exposition, and a great deal of speculation based on what he thinks he knows, what he discovers, and how it all eventually comes together.If you're interested in the psychological aspect of thrillers then give this a shot, however if you're looking for an action based plot then this might be too slow a build up for you.~Received from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

I am a mental health clinician, and in an eerie twist, I read a diagnosis and evaluation of a severely mentally ill young man the next day after I finished this book-and it gave me goosebumps. It was like I was back in the mind of Yu-Jin. This author\u2019s voice for his protagonist is that authentic.

Yu-Jin was a successful swimmer previously until he became ill and was prescribed medication.

There was something about it that was dark and mysterious yet still so transparent. On my ARC edition there was also a movable blood stain which gave the \u2018creepy\u2019 vibe before I\u2019d even opened the book!The story had a very dark side from the get go. Yu-Jin appears to be a confusing character at first, but after reading from snapshots of his past, you begin to understand, just as Yu-Jin is understanding himself.There was no real structure in terms of formal chapters to this book which was both a pro and a con. (Pro: I had to read on to the next natural pause in the book before being able to put it down. Con: There were very few natural pauses!) But I found myself not being able to put this book down.Yu-Jin\u2019s relationshp with his brother, mother, auntie and friend take the reader on a whirlwind of twisted events and deceit. You are taklen back to events of Yu-Jin as a young boy and then flipped back into the situation he now finds himself in.There is very little dialogue, and so much more descriptive writing which usually makes a book feel quite heavy going, but The Good Son was a pleasure to read throughout. I was constantly thinking about how talented the writer (and translator) were for developing such a creative piece of writing.I felt myself able to visualise everything about this book which just proves how immersive the text is. Although the ending was slightly predictable, I felt that the suspense held throughout from page 1.I was extremely impressed with The Good Son. I wouldn\u2019t usually consider this to be my kind of book. All the promotion compares it to the work of Stephen King (of which I have not read, and have no intention to) so I thought this would be too intense and would lose my interest.
