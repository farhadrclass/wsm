He has survived a lot in this twisted world , and though he is privileged to work as a carpenter instead of a field hand, he is in danger of losing his humanity:He remembered first hand the trauma of separation when his mother was sold. He was raised by Mam Rosie and for a brief time her husband Darby, as Darby was sold soon after. He grew tall and made himself a secret promise that he would be different. He would not love anything. He would make his heart cold.But we\u2019ve all sang that song at times, you know, the Simon and Garfunkle one, \u201cI Am a Rock\u201d, and that outlook really doesn\u2019t sustain you. Cassius has loved, and he has lost. He was married to Marriah and they had a baby. That story ended badly from the hands of his owners, Hoke and Ellen Howard, which is all I should say. In the narrative of his present, he is alone, but two forces are drawing him out of his shell. One is his protective concerns for a new acquisition for the plantation, Quashee, a teenaged beauty put to the harsh labor of the fields. The other is a desire for revenge over the murder of Emoline, a freed slave who nursed him back from his brutal punishments for rebellion after the loss of his family.Quashee\u2019s spirit moves Cassius to risky actions to save her from the lusts of Big Gus, a driver for the plantation given power and privilege in exchange for keeping order among the slaves for the master. Cassius works behind the scenes to get Quashee taken into household service, and in the process of foiling a competitor for the position makes a moral choice on the order of that portrayed in \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice\u201d. In this darkness of his soul, he begins to struggle again against the chains of his credo that, in the words of Kris Kristofferson, \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got nothing, you got nothing to lose\u201d. He and Quashee begin to nurture a love that he feels bound to quash: \u201cIf you don\u2019t love, then there\u2019s one thing they can\u2019t destroy.\u201cEmoline was the closest thing Cassius has had to motherly love and a beacon of what a life of freedom could be. She makes a living through herbal medicine and fortune telling. She secretly taught Cassius to read during his recovery, and he comes to learn she secretly worked as a spy selling information to the Union relevant to the movements and plans of the Confederate Army. Was this work the cause of her murder or was there a personal reason? In pursuit of the answer and retribution, Cassius risks his life many times, and his quest drives him to explore the espionage network. He is surprised to be treated with respect by the whites working for this cause. He is stumped when one of them asks him what it\u2019s like to be a slave, as he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow what it is not to be a slave\u201d since his life isn\u2019t his own. Some of insights he begins to gain about the institute of slavery point to a paradox of how the white masters are in many ways enslaved by the system themselves. When Hoke is laid low by illness, his wife Ellen has to take charge. Her illusions of virtue over running a big happy family clash with a sense of being trapped:A strange and fleeting image entered Ellen\u2019s mind, that of a large cage in a small room. The cage was filled with slaves while their masters were outside the cage squeezed and immobile in the narrow space between cage and walls. This was a queer image indeed as both master and slave were unable to reach the fresh air that beckoned through a wide open door. Cassius\u2019 suspicions about Emoline\u2019s murderer leads him to pursue a Rebel quartermaster in General Lee\u2019s army under the ruse of bringing back a son of Hoke and Ellen. The search leads him to Maryland and into the middle of the horrors of the Battle of Sharpsburg, which ended Lee\u2019s invasion of Union territory. Fuller is especially eloquent in these apocalyptic scenes and Cassius\u2019 reaction to whites killing whites on an impossible scale, all somehow to do with keeping his people in subjugation.Fuller clearly goes beyond any didactic goal of exposing the evils of slavery, which has been well covered in the time since \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d. It was a riveting story for me full of universal themes of struggles over fate and choice, the limits of compromise, and the risks of loving. On one level, the tale parallels that of Cassius in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Cesar\u201d, for whom he was named. He secretly reads the play and can\u2019t decide whether to identify with the integrity and competence of the character or his treachery. In my recent reads of novels on slavery, this one ranks up there for me with Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cA Mercy\u201d and more satisfying than Edward Jones\u2019 \u201cThe Known World\u201d, albeit without their high quality of prose."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "I live in the south. Every day, I see relics of days that to some symbolize the glory of the south, to others, a time of great shame for humankind. I was not born into southern culture (indeed, my own family fled from persecution elsewhere to settle in the United States in the days before World War I), but I still feel the scars that the enslavement of African Americans left on our world. When a friend from another country had trouble enjoying a visit to Charleston, saying he could feel the pain of slavery as he walked the streets of the city, it was a knife to my heart. It is not the way we live now, at least not in this part of the world, and while we are not perfect, I wonder how long those who inhabit this land will bear the responsibility of scars of the past.Many people have a romanticized vision of slavery, due in part to its depiction in novels and movies. But even the kindest rendition in print or screen cannot deny that at its core, slavery involves ownership of one person over another. Sweetsmoke presents the reader with a huge array of relationships between between people of the south in that time of our history. The brutality is unflinching, the loyalties complex, the relationships tangled. It is a glimpse into the darkness of our past, exploring diverse aspects of the human psyche. It's a retelling of that wound in our national history called the Civil War. It's a character study of a man of passions and principles, despite his enslavement. It's a reminder that our greatest downfall is man's inhumanity to man, and our greatest strength is our ability to open our hearts to other people, and strive for what is right. I thought the author's technique of using quotation marks around the speech of free people, black or white, and none around the speech of the enslaved was a powerful tool to keep the reader reminded of the degradation of the human spirit when we succumb to the evils of saying we own another individual.This is a book that is complex, and I may reread, because there are certainly nuances I missed. There were some moments in it that opened my eyes, not so much about the institution of slavery, but more regarding how the world was in that time-- figuring out how to pass a message, cross a river, make a rendezvous. I even found myself looking up some of the herbs and medicinal plants mentioned, as that's an interest of mine.Many thanks to my friend Maggie, who recommended this book to me. I will pass it on thoughtfully."}, {"userName": "Booknblues", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4280875-booknblues", "userReview": "SweetsmokeBy David Fuller5 starspp. 310Sweetsmoke by David Fuller is a mystery. Sweetsmoke by David Fuller is a character study. Sweetsmoke by David Fuller is a historical fiction. It is truly all of these and more. David Fuller spent eight years researching and writing this novel about a plantation called Sweetsmoke set in 1862 during the Civil War. His work is deeply moving, with prose that brings the reader into the setting and characters which are complex and interesting. Fuller does not shy away from the conflicts and personality disorders which occur when one group of people \"own\" another and this is part of the appeal of the story and it is a gripping and exciting story.I was so impressed with Fuller's development of the central character, Cassius Howard, a slave who was trained by the plantation owner, Hoke Howard, as a carpenter and as such was given certain freedom and was on occasion lent to other plantation to help them in their buildings. Cassius is a reflective, intelligent and secret individual with great strength of character along with many internal conflicts: \"Sounds of the plantation slipped in clear and bright, then were just as quickly muffled, a fragment of work song followed by a ghostly stillness, the drifting laughter of children, blown away by the rush of overhead wind. A deep ache built inside him as he listened to people living, working and being together. A fierce and terrible melancholy gripped him and he did not understand why the feeling made him desire to live. Finally, a breath of breeze passed under the brim of his hat and cooled the sweat, and Cassius was released from the moment.\"When Cassius learns that Emoline, the free woman who helped him when he was deeply injured, has been murdered, he vows to find out who murdered her and avenge her. While Cassius is given certain freedoms as a carpenter his quest his still fraught with such danger, that it keeps the reader on edge and unable to put the book down. I know as I read through much of a night.The Civil War is ever present and the way in which Howard managed to incorporate into the book is interesting and exciting. For the civil war enthusiast, I believe this will prove to be a must read. I found that I needed to do some research while reading it and was reward for doing so, a secret I will not divulge in this review.Fuller is a screenwriter and I could easily see this adapted as a movie. I hear that Fuller is working on another novel and my hope is that he writes another book about Cassius, because I want to know what will happen to him next."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151601-tony", "userReview": "I have to admit that this book's basic premise was strong enough to carry me through the story's few rough patches. Set in the midst of the Civil War (1862), the story introduces us to Cassius, a slave carpenter. He enjoys a special status among the slaves at the titular Virginia tobacco plantation -- not only for his skill as a craftsman (which makes him more valuable than mere field hands), but also because he was a childhood playmate of the plantation's master. The death of his wife and child several years ago has made him rather insular, and unlike some of the other \"higher ranking\" slaves he prefers to keep a low profile and not get caught up in the plantations' social jockeying and intrigues.However, when Emoline Justice, a local free black woman, herbalist, and fortune teller is found murdered, Cassius decides to cautiously pursue justice on her soul's behalf. She was a kind of mother/mentor figure to him, having nursed him back from death's door, and taught him to read and write. What follows is a kind of blend of historical fiction about plantation life and a whodunit murder mystery. For this to work, the reader has to accept that Cassius' secret literacy enables him to travel rather more freely than most slaves (although not without peril), allowing him to go into town and the surrounding countryside to pursue clues.This story is pretty gripping, since on top of the hunt for the killer, there's the war lurking not too far away, Underground Railroad operations in the area, plus slavers, spies, and a full cast of realized characters. And if that's not enough, the book also does a very nice job of dramatizing the \"private\" life of slaves, which themselves are fraught with peril, as plots to curry favor abound, allegiances shift, and anyone might be sold off at any point. Yes, certain elements are somewhat idealized and sanitized, but it's fiction and you either have to accept that or resign yourself to not really enjoying the book (there are plenty of true narratives of slavery if that's your main interest). This is an excellent mix of plot, setting, and character -- a book that makes you think about a certain era in a slightly different way by bringing it to life."}, {"userName": "Mocha Girl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1251457-mocha-girl", "userReview": "The advanced praise and publisher's accolades for Sweetsmoke are not unwarranted. David Fuller has penned a rich, full-bodied story that centers on a slave's (Cassius) desire to identify the killer of a free-woman who is endeared to him via bewildering circumstances. To its credit, the novel goes deeper than the average \"whodunit.\" It is the equally complex sub-plots, the noble and conniving characters, the accuracy of the historical content, and the wonderfully imagined social network of life, love, loss, and pain on a Virginia Plantation at the onset of the Civil War that add layers of depth and incredible breadth to the story. The politics and racial attitudes of the day are illustrated well in the book which also contained some of the most vivid battlefield scenes I have read. So often books of this nature cover the master-slave relationship in the perfunctory manner, but Fuller exceeded my expectations by creating some very unique relationships among the slaves and the slave owners. Another aspect that I respected was the equal weight given to the happenings inside the \"big house\" as well as the slave quarters. He also vigilantly broached valid but unpopular topics such as as slaves supporting the Confederacy and the manipulation, betrayal, and infighting within the slave community. He also showed us the intelligence, bravery, and cunning of Cassius as he navigated the plantation and the free world. Bottom line: There are several reviews posted already that enthusiastically endorse the novel and I agree wholeheartedly with them. Most likely this novel will make my personal Top Reads list for this year -- I enjoyed it for the history lessons, the mystery, and the characters. This book is firmly on equal footing with The March by E.L. Doctorow, Song Yet Sung by James McBride, and Stand the Storm by Breena Clarke. Recommended for historical fiction fans interested in the US slave institution during the Civil War era."}, {"userName": "CAW", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1566745-caw", "userReview": "This is a dry-earth book, filled with very fully-realised characters and the sort of incidental details I love in a narrative, the kind Mark Twain would deplore: a drifting scrap of cobweb, the precise way the wind shakes the trees, suchlike things.The protagonist is an extremely emotionally repressed man, which makes his reactions interesting but imparts a very detached feel to the narrative. A plantation slave wandering Virginia in 1862 has some visceral sights to see, but nothing really moves Cassius on a surface level...things shift within him slowly and deeply, which reflects admirable skill on the part of the writer but gives the reader little to connect to. This lack of connection and surface emotion may be why the book strikes me as unsatisfying...deep and/or slow characters are great, especially when they're as intelligent and silently angry as Cassius, but what makes a great story is when that smouldering eventually flares to action. I expected Cassius to someday get his quotation marks (slaves in the book speak without these) after all the steps he'd taken towards free thinking, but instead the book meanders to a halt."}, {"userName": "\u2615Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15033381-laura", "userReview": "I initially waivered on whether or not to read this book. The premise -- a slave investigating a murder -- was interesting, but seemed like the kind of plot that could go really, really wrong and become completely unrealistic. I am so glad that I finally decided to read this book, as I really enjoyed it. I found myself interested both in the mystery and the characters themselves. The liberties which the slave Cassius were granted made sense in the context of the storyline and the complex relationship between himself and Master Hoke. The deceptions and backstabbing among the slaves and among the members of the household added depth to the story, and the author's vivid descriptions brought it to life. His depictions of the horrors both of slavery and of the battlefield were impressive and humbling."}, {"userName": "Aryn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6415628-aryn", "userReview": "I finally figured out what made this book so awkward to read. Only the free people's speech was in quotation marks. This left all the slaves' speech out of quotation marks. When some speech is in quotes and some isn't it makes for a very difficult read. It made it hard to tell what was really being said and what was thought process. It was an interesting concept for writing a Civil War era historical fiction novel, but in practice it just ended up being awkward and hard to read.I ended up skimming the last 100 pages or so of this book."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1335578-maggie", "userReview": "Rated 4-1/2 if the site allowed it. David Fuller is a screen writer, thus he has an excellent command of pacing, which was evident in this book. Although this book read like a character-driven novel, there was action at every turn. Cassius is a 30-something slave on a Virginia tobacco plantation, Sweetsmoke, owned by Hoke Howard, who has been his only owner and had named him at birth. The whereabouts of his parents is never discussed, but he was raised by old Mam' Rosie, who also raised Hoke's children. Hoke and Cassius have a complex relationship, part long-standing affection, part fear (on both sides), and part grudging respect. Early in the book Hoke tells Cassius the bad news that Emoline, a former slave freed by Hoke some years before, and a woman who had saved Cassius' life after he fled the plantation, had been murdered. Though Hoke had clearly once loved Emoline, he seems to feel no interest in who the murderer is. Cassius, however, feels he must uncover it and avenge her death. The reader really feels the plight of the slaves, and one of the ways it's made obvious is that whenever anyone who is free speaks there are quote marks around their speech. If they are slaves, there are no quotes. Thus, the reader is always aware of the difference in position of the speakers, even between a slave and a freed negro. The descriptions of slave life are often very gritty and give the reader an excellent idea of how horrible it was to be property of another human, one who felt their property was subhuman and inconsequential. Also, the description of the battle at Sharpsburg is one of the best battle scenes I've ever read. It is also apparent that the slaves themselves are jockeying for position and will often do whatever is necessary to advance themselves, even at the expense of another slave. There were several instances when women (usually the flowers of the South, so often thought to be so kind and benevolent) were spiteful, manipulative, or cruel, to the ultimate degradation, horrible pain, or death of the slaves. My only argument with the book was that Cassius' life seemed to be charmed both when he was young, and during the events of this book. There certainly was a period of about five years when his life was very, very bad, but otherwise he seemed to be able to get away with nearly anything he wanted. Fuller was careful to explain all those instances, but still it stretched the imagination too far. I loved many quotes in the book. The following are a few that stood out: \"Cassius still found it odd to be spoken of as if he were deaf or invisible. It happened often; whites simply said whatever was on their minds from front of their 'people,' bluntly revealing their thoughts and secrets. . . . knowing he was taken so lightly made him feel small.\" \"Humiliations from planters, their families, and every other white man, woman, and child in the county are more easily borne when your new partner hasn't been witness to your history of degradation, thus allowing you to maintain a small measure of dignity.\" \"Hoke looked at Cassius and his eyes were burdened with the helplessness of a terrible knowledge. In dismay, Cassius felt Hoke's empathy enfold him and finally understood his punishment. He did not intend to sell Cassius. Cassius was to witness the results of his actions, actions that had brought Tempie to this place, and thus be foreced to confront his conscience. The bleached muslin of the tent, warmly lit and close, embraced a history of anguish and grief and apprehension, the last place so many, God, so many people, would ever see their sons and daughters, their mothers and fathers and grandparents, their sisters and brothers and playmates before they were sold, and as the side of the tent bowed and shuddered in a soft breeze, Cassius heard a collective moan.\" \"A pet is something to love, a dog particularly. He loves you without opinion or judgment, he does not speak to you indignantly, he does not confuse your affections with foolish ideas and odd perspectives; he merely loves. I sometimes think of how easy it was for my father to favor you, Cassius.\""}, {"userName": "Wisteria Leigh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1276167-wisteria-leigh", "userReview": "Sweetsmoke, is the name of a fictitious southern plantation owned by Hoke Howard.

As the American Civil War rages on the periphery, Cassius spends his days tending to carpentry needs on the plantation and taking advantage of the small amount of freedom granted to him by the plantation master, Hoke Howard.After a close friend is murdered, Cassius vows to find the killer, even though he risks the few things he holds dear in the process.At its core, Sweetsmoke is a decent novel, especially coming from a new novelist. But the quality fluctuates through, which leads to a lot of headaches. Fuller often intercuts some well crafted intrigue with laborious descriptions of minutia, almost like he's trying to prove he did his historical research (in case you're wondering, he did). This is especially true for the first half of the novel; it's almost tough to make it through a few pages without grumbling. That said, it picks up near the end, and the bittersweet conclusion works quite well in the context. Fuller also paints some compelling characters; he does a nice job of showing how multifaceted these people are. Sweetsmoke was a fairly promising read, even though it had lapse of cluttered, over expository dialogue and descriptions.

It draws in the senses and sets a mood. The novel does the same. It draws us into the life of Cassius, a slave on the Sweetsmoke plantation during the Civil War, and gives us a sense of the sights, sounds, and smells of that life. Even more importantly, though, it imparts, more effectively than any book that I've read, what it means to be a slave, what it means to be an intelligent adult treated as a child or property.I love historical fiction and this book has all of the elements of great historical fiction. The main character is compelling and many of the others are multi-dimensional. There is a clear sense of place and a wonderful integration of the historical events taking place at that time. David Fuller spent years researching this book, and it shows. The historical details are right .The writing is skillful and descriptive.

David Fuller's book is part murder mystery, part description of plantation life, and part war novel. Unfortunately because it tries to to fulfill so many roles it fulfills none of them well. By the time the murder mystery was finally solved, I had become distracted by so many other plot lines that I no longer cared who the murderer was. Additionally, with the exception of the main character, the slave Cassius, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting. For instance, I never could figure out the allure of Emoline, the former slave murdered in the early chapters of the book. I also found it completely unrealistic that Cassius, a previously uneducated man, could learn to read and write so well in such a short period of time. Because much of the plot hinges on this development, I had a hard time appreciating and believing most of the story. The one positive aspect of this book is that it presented the complex relationship between slaves and owners without resorting to stereotypes.

He has also experienced more than his share of tragedy, losing a son to the slave traders, a wife to suicide, and a mentor to murder. It is the final tragedy, the murder of the free black woman, Cassius' mentor Emoline, that drives him through the rest of the book. For me, though, it was the beautiful writing and Cassius himself who really made this book worth reading. I found myself in a wholly new position, with a new perspective on what it may have been like to live life as a slave.

This book showed me that slaves were led to believe they couldn't think or reason or even care for anyone. The phrase, \"Love brings death,\" was used. Love a spouse; the owner could sleep with your wife, sell your husband and children, and then blame it on you. It makes me so ashamed to think that perhaps my ancestors owned other humans.

William Styron, in THE CONFESSIONS OF NAT TURNER proved that any inherent racial controversy could be countered with excellent writing, nuanced characters, a living backdrop of history and setting, and a gripping plot. SWEETSMOKE achieves this quality, presenting a complex story of a slave, Cassius, the layered intriques among his fellow slaves, the personalities and foibles of the slave-owner family on this Virginia tobacco plantation, and a murder mystery, all set during a teetering period that would prove to be among the bloodiest and a turning point in the Civil War. Fuller\u2019s screenplay writing skill is evident in his clearly visualized scenes, alive with detail, his use of dialogue, and his careful plot construction: holding back information to compel readers forward, such as the identity of the person who has died in the opening pages of the book. Cassius senses how all the other slaves turn their heads when he passes, how the master\u2019s wife and the house workers, how the very air, conspire to hold back the name, which he knows will be painful to him. Descriptions of the brutality and violence of slave life and war are as equally detailed as Cassius\u2019 careful observations of expressions and body language, but the language of violence is more spare, allowing a sharp picture without melodrama and excessively emotional language that would get in the way of the terrible inhumane acts that the system fostered.I had a little trouble accepting that Cassius would survive while witnessesing the confluence of viscious battles in Manassas and Antietam, but by then Fuller had shown what an exceptional survivalist Cassius is. I also wished that more time was allowed for readers to linger on the seemingly brief, yet important relationship between the murdered person and Cassius, to help understand his motivations for finding her killer and his need for revenge. The story is also told through the point of view of Ellen, the matron of Sweetsmoke Plantation. Fuller\u2019s interesting choice to use her voice, rather than the more obvious choice of the master Hoke Howard\u2019s viewpoint allows us to see aspects of the stresses of plantation life from within, and not from the blustering power-holding pinnacle there, but from a more fragile and wary player. It provides insight into the tricky relationships and attachments of slave and master and how it affected every part of life, one\u2019s relationship with one\u2019s spouse included. Although somewhat farfetched, Fuller\u2019s use of Shakespeare\u2019s JULIUS CEASAR and THE ILIAD allow moments for Cassius to focus on questions of his identity and the nature of slavery, but in the back of my mind I was thinking that even with Cassius\u2019 (hidden ability to read and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, such texts are difficult to grasp without context, and likely had vocabulary and archaic syntax that would have made understanding of them more difficult than they seemed to be for Cassius. I also found it odd that the dialogue by slaves was never in quotes, while everyone else\u2019s was. Since this was never explained, I assume it indicates that these were voices that were never really heard, and it did have the effect that the spoken words were internal, were thoughts, and not spoken. It was at times confusing, and the reasons for lack of quotes felt a bit contrived and therefore obtrusive. I also had a little trouble with the very first paragraph, the opening scene. It was written with a cinematic approach, as if a camera were entering onto a scene of two boys fighting, but the focus that would have worked better for me would have been to know from the outset that we were seeing this scene through Cassius\u2019 eyes. But in summary, Fuller, in SWEETSMOKE, succeeded with a difficult challenge: to portray slaves and slave owners as human, real, flawed and powerless, both as victims to a human evil. I\u2019m a harsh critic, so I give it 3.75 stars."}, {"userName": "Todd Stockslager", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager", "userReview": "First-time novelist puts his screenwriting background to good use in \"Sweetsmoke\". While historical fiction about the Civil War is a crowded genre all by itself, \"Sweetsmoke\" harvests new fields by focusing on--a plantation in Central Virginia, not the Deep South or Virginia Tidewater settings more often chosen.--1862, a year early in the war, before events reached an ebb tide of inevitability that often overwhelms Civil War novels.--events on the plantation, not on the war. The war is barely-noticed background until the final 50 pages, allowing focus on the characters and relationships on the plantation.--the murder of a freed black woman, and the efforts of a slave carpenter on the plantation to determine and avenge her killer. While Fuller cheats a bit by making Cassius a trusted skilled laborer with more freedom and mobility than the house or field slaves, many key conflicts and confrontations involve his efforts to overcome the limitations of his position as chattel.Fuller has clearly done his research well, and hits the key touchpoints that one expects of his chosen historical time, place, and characters. At the same time, the main characters--Cassius, the murdered Emoline, the plantation owner Hoke Howard, and Cassius's love interest Quashee--are fully realized so that the book never feels like a thinly-veiled history book.Cassius Howard is the key to the quality of \"Sweetsmoke\", a truly heroic and humanized character who guides us through the action. Fuller writes in third-person omniscient perspective, so that we understand events through Cassius's eyes and mind, a necessary conceit to enable Fuller to convey the depth of ambiguity and complexity of the slave relationships--with owner, overseer, slave boss, patrollers, other slaves on the plantation, slaves from other plantations, townspeople, and even a smuggler and spy, who plays a key role in the mystery.I do not often rate a first novel five stars, but Fuller told a story that kept me interested from a deceptively slow start that enables us to get to know the characters, through dramatic crises on the plantation, to the climactic journey into the war that Cassius must make to carry an urgent message to his owner's son and resolve the mystery that has grown to consume him. He ends up, on a September morning in mid September 1862, in a small copse of wood, beside a field of corn due for harvesting, just over the Potomac River in Maryland, outside the small town of Sharpsburg--on the bloodiest single day of the Civil war and United States history. Safely in the background for the whole book, the Civil War takes center stage for a few pages as Fuller describes some of the most intense fighting of the war--events which left Cassius on the edge of freedom with the opportunity to run. Fuller keeps the reader on the edge of the dilemma until the final paragraph, and in the process earns a \"what a classic\" rating."}, {"userName": "Bobbie  Crawford", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1326467-bobbie-crawford", "userReview": "Sweetsmoke,Written By: David FullerPublished By: Hyperion, 2008, First Edition, 320 pages, hardcover, ISBN 978-1-4013-2331-8\u201cSweetsmoke is a poignant novel that leads you through the life and mind of a black slave and the worries and difficulties he faces as he goes \u2018on a mission\u2019 to find the person who murdered his one, true friend.\u201dBCMCassius is a slave-carpenter who is owned by the Howard\u2019s of Sweetsmoke plantation.

Clearly, he was the plantation (Sweetsmoke) owner's favorite but there was a lot going on and the story got pretty involved unraveling the back story lines. This book gives a lot of insight into plantation life during the Civil War - we're all familiar with the antebellum period but not so much during the war when all the plantation owners had to keep their slaves from running was fear . . . and it worked. I listened to the book read on CD and I don't recommend that venue.

Whenever I read where a Negro character wants to perserve his place in slavery because they have it so good, I always look up the author and invarabily it is a White person. This book is no different and it ruins my ability to enjoy the book. While I don't think every book should be about the horrors of slavery, I do think that writers should do research and write characters who were believable and consistent with their time period. In the slave narratives I have read, the pleasure of slavery was never mentioned, certainly not a theme. So it makes me suspect that the writer had a book in mind, and really didn't have a love or knowledge of the time. Please do your research before writing about a world or time you don't know."}], "description": "The year is 1862, and the Civil War rages through the South. On a Virginia tobacco plantation, another kind of battle soon begins. There, Cassius Howard, a skilled carpenter and slave, risks everything--punishment, sale to a cotton plantation, even his life--to learn the truth concerning the murder of Emoline, a freed black woman, a woman who secretly taught him to read and once saved his life. It is clear that no one cares about her death in the midst of a brutal and hellish war. No one but Cassius, who braves horrific dangers to escape the plantation and avenge her loss. As Cassius seeks answers about Emoline's murder, he finds an unexpected friend and ally in Quashee, a new woman brought over from another plantation; and a formidable adversary in Hoke Howard, the master he has always obeyed. With subtlety and beauty, Sweetsmoke captures the daily indignities and harrowing losses suffered by slaves, the turmoil of a country waging countless wars within its own borders, and the lives of those people fighting for identity, for salvation, and for freedom.", "title": "Sweetsmoke", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3185276-sweetsmoke", "average": 3.71, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1365985771l/3185276.jpg", "reviews": 121, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/319822.David_Fuller", "name": "David Fuller"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Military History", "Mystery", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3185276-sweetsmoke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7123029-sweetsmoke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9181783-sweetsmoke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693905-sundance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31703193-profit-yourself-healthy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19237513-alfie-jones-and-a-change-of-fortune", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18112725-chasing-the-devil-s-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23997856-split-loyalties", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
