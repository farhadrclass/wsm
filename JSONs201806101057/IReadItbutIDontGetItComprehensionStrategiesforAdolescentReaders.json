Her students who struggled to read were put into her Reading Workshop and felt things like, \"It's too late for me to read\" and I love how personal and professional Cris Tovani is, like how real she is when she describes her own reading history of fake-reading for classes up to the end of high school and feeling worried that she couldn't continue with this touching-the-surface style in college (YES, ME TOO, OMG re: Shakespeare) and then connecting/relating to her students with this information.I've read so much about the writing process, like what happens when you write (you think), but less about reading (just Calvino's If on a winter's night maybe) even though I periodically feel concerned that I think more about thinking than thinking about things specifically. I want to read more books like this about people who catch up later than usual, or re-learn their learning to realize that subjects they struggled with were made inaccessible somehow, like this article on: \"An experience with some able women who avoid mathematics.pdf\".Anyway, I definitely wrongly believed in college that smart people read things fast and got them the first time and I kept trying to figure out how to keep up with my required reading aka how do I SPEED-READ. But Cris Tovani is like, \"no, you adjust to the level of difficulty in the text: slow down when it's hard, speed up when it's easy\" and some things she writes seem like they should be \"obvious\" but I'm glad to see it stated so explicitly, such as:+ book clubs & classes & just discussion: creating meaning together, making sense of the text together+ tracking your confusion and distraction (lol: I enjoyed the parts where Cris or the students admit that their mind just wanders off, like the girl who read the word party and started thinking of the party she went to the night before)+ two reading voices: the one that pronounces the words, the one that responds with thoughts & feelings & questions+ asking clarification & pondering questions before, during, after your reading+ lol @ outlandish student responses to text with no evidence and responding that it's their opinion, so it's untouchable re: its in/accuracy. I think I did this a lot in college. Not making good inferences and trying to look for it in the text but it's not there- - -I feel inspired to be a reading teacher. Cris Tovani concluded in 2000 that \"Tomorrow's citizens face greater demands than ever before. The written word is no longer restricted to paper form. Children of all ages are being bombarded with information from the Internet and other electronic forms of print. The \"E\"-generation needs to comprehend more than ever before. Readers of tomorrow must do more than memorize words. They must be prepared to analyze, validate, and ask the next logical question. They have to know how to think.\"Yes."}, {"userName": "Ivonne Rovira", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3803671-ivonne-rovira", "userReview": "Cris Tovani, herself once a struggling reader, provides some excellent advice.

I loved this book. Unfortunately it is a giant catalogue of things I now realize I should be doing in my classroom, but was oblivious to. On practically every page I had a face-palm moment, realizing about my students, \"oh, THAT's what they're doing.\" I knew nothing about teaching reading, but now I have some ideas and a bit of insight. My students have no problem reading newspaper articles or novels. But when trying to read their textbooks, all but one or two are at sea. Even when they know all the words, they can't make meaning out of them. I don't have the answers, but this book pointed me in the direction of a ton of questions. And they're not just questions about reading comprehension. I get the feeling they're about comprehension in general; in other words, some of this material is about teaching critical thinking and intentional learning.Some things I want to hang on to for later:\"Word callers have mastered decoding... but often don't do well with tasks that require them to use the words they read... These readers feel powerless because the only strategy they have for gaining meaning is sounding out words.\" (p. 15)\"...he expects meaning to arrive immediately after he reads the words. He doesn't know good readers construct meaning. One day in class, Tim interrupts my lesson to accuse me of wasting everyone's time. He isn't interested in historical background knowledge. ... Tim spend the majority of the semester trying to change the way I taught. ... When confusion set in, Tim thought it was the teacher's job to fix it.\" (p. 16)Rumelhart's Cueing systems that readers use to understand text: graphophonic, lexical, syntactic, semantic, schematic, pragmatic. (p. 18)Why they can't make meaning: \"Don't have the comprehension strategies, Don't have sufficient background knowledge, Don't recognize organizational patterns, Lack purpose.\" (p. 19)Learning to find the purpose of the reading, from different points of view (an exercise) (p. 26)How to model reading (p. 27)How to mark text (p. 29)Self-assessment: How to find your own confusion (p. 30) - Pseudolearning: \"they didn't recognize confusion until they had to do something with the information.\" (p. 33)How to get unstuck (p. 46) - how students conceal their lack of strategies by parroting the \"right\" answers (p. 50) - Tovani's strategies (p. 51)Double-entry diary note-taking system (p. 31 )How to design a guided worksheet for a particular thinking strategy (p. 32)I don't know anything about the topic (p. 67) - Find connections to your experience: connecting to a movie isn't \"cheating\"!

I read, but I can't focus. When I'm reading I skip lines, sometimes chapters. Different things pop\u2019s up in my head . \"When we got outside of the duke of the New York we viddied, by the man bar's long liothed window.\" This quote is from the Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess. It was complicated for me to get a deep connection of what is coming up on the next paragraph, and what I just read before that. I wish that books would talk to me and I would find them more interesting. First I always start off excited about a book. I read the cover, look for the name of the Author, find the year it was published, skim through and see if there are any pictures, I always start out good. But then that concentration quickly disappears. I start to skip lines, and sometimes I read the first paragraph of a chapter and then skip to the end. I drink a juice, I have a little snack on the side, I make sure I'm clean and wide awake, but it just doest't work for me. When I was reading the The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain during my freshmen year, it was the most difficult book I ever read. I had to look it up on Spark Notes and read there what it was about, and what happen in each chapter so I could get a decent grade. I don't want to but i have to. It seems like a constant struggle in my self-conscience. Often times when I'm reading a book, different things pops up in my head. Consequently, When I see a word that I'm familiar with I connect it to something else, like a song for instance. I start to sing without thinking that I have a book in my hand, my focus on the book runs away, and I find myself looking for the song on the Internet or on my ipod. The fact that my dad is miles and miles away from me doest't help me to concentrate either. Especially if I find a word that makes me think about him, it takes away my focus on the book. Many concerned thoughts jump into my head. I start to wonder about everything my dad have been trough, what is he doing at that exact moment, and if he is okay or not. I miss him a lot. This summer when I went to go visit him, its fair to say that I did not pick up a book at all. Even more, I can't really comprehend what's happening in the book. When I'm reading and I see a bunch of pages without pictures, I get really bored and I just read without understanding what I'm reading. It's not interesting and does not connect to me. I read to myself, listening with my right ear, but it just goes right out through my left ear. I tried to read this book called A Separate Peace by John Knowles, and it says \"He had unconsciously invented a game which brought his own athletic gifts to their highest pitch.\" When I read that my mind just zoned out and I started day dreaming. After hearing the words \"game\" and \"pitch\", every game that I ever played, and anything else about baseball that I can think of, just popped into my head.  Reading books can be hard for certain people. I'm not lying here. Everything I say is true, its happens to me. I can't focus, I skip chapters, and I can't concentrate. When I'm reading and I'm looking at a word that I'm familiar with, it makes me think of something else, and I don't even comprehend. I'm a sophomore now and I know it's not good to have the issue while I am reading a book. Recently I learned in history class, that to be a good reader we need to do public speaking and writing. I have good abilities to do both of them. The reason why I am writing this essay is to get interested in reading a book. So I can add the reading skills to my head , and connect them to my speaking and writing skills. Tell everyone how proud I am for gaining these skills and clearly tell them that my second language is English."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10615172-monica", "userReview": "I have been teaching sixth grade for the past 16 years and there was nothing in this book that was new to me.

I already do them but it was nice to see them all written up. I also liked her example for how she teaches a purpose for reading. There were some helpful examples in the back as well.

I loved it then and still adore this professional resource now. Cris Tovani reminds me that reading is so much more than decoding and pronouncing words - it's a complex process between the reader and what he or she is reading. Although this book is about strategy instruction in reading, Cris Tovani's message is more about giving students agency to make meaning for whatever they are reading - not just teaching students the strategy. She emphasizes that students need to know why and how strategies make students stronger readers. Through her writing, you can tell that Cris Tovani is such an honest and reflective practitioner, providing examples of how conversations and insights from her students have moved her forward in her own learning. In my opinion, she was one of the forerunners of how to clearly make her thinking visible through modeling to students (especially adolescent readers).

I'd planned to take it home for the summer but it ended up in the wrong box. It took me a while to find it again so I'll probably spend some time re-reading.It's a good book, filled with anecdotes. The strategies tend to be general but I like the way the anecdotes deal with both struggling readers and \"successful\" readers. After all, don't we all become struggling readers when we read a topic we are unfamiliar with?I would recommend reading this short book in small doses, perhaps a chapter a day.

Throughout the book Tovani relays conversations and scenarios from her own teaching experiences with adolescents in a high school reading workshop as well as her own history as a poor reader. The emphasis throughout the book is on modeling thinking strategies and explicit instruction on the skills good readers employ.There were many strategies and modeling examples I liked in this book. One of the methods in the book is teaching students to listen to the conversation and interacting voices inside their head rather than their reciting voice or even the distracting voice (45). I also particularly liked Tovani's \"Fix It!\" chapter where she outlines strategies and modeling techniques for teaching students what to do when they get stuck reading (49-61). Tovani also does a nice job writing about the modeling process necessary to help students make connections to prior knowledge and ultimately use this skill to repair confusion (63-78). In addition, she writes about encouraging student curiosity and questioning to establish purpose for reading (79-95).At the end of the book, Tovani also includes \"Access Tools\" or examples of hand-outs one can use to encourage the skills discussed in the book. Overall, this is a great book for teachers who would like a refresher course on reading strategies, for any content area teacher who would like to teach more reading in their class, and for teachers new to explicit reading instruction. This is not, however, a book that will rock your world as a practicing reading teacher. While a couple of the ideas Tovani includes for implementation are unique, the bulk of the book is pretty standard reading instruction."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1803484-heather", "userReview": "A constant go-to.

Yet somehow, I loved her book and it convinced me that I can, in fact, teach my sophomores to be better readers. Tovani offers very general insights into reading problems and sets up very vague, but logical, recommendations to fix the places where comprehension breaks down. Her text has convinced me to completely revamp the first month of my teaching schedule next year so I can truly make my students better readers. Ultimately, what it comes down to is this: Tovani has the ethos to make me listen. She comes across as a real classroom teacher--like the colleague next door you want to question constantly because she has the best ideas. She admits her kids don't always play along, so as a reader, I feel more empowered to try her strategies. I mean hey, they didn't always work perfectly even for her so I can just try again without wondering why I failed. She helps teachers see how we can adjust when things go wrong, which is ultimately what we're trying to teach our students about reading.

Since I am teaching reading this year, I figured I would brush up on some of the skills and strategies for teaching at-risk readers. I found quite a few interesting philosophies that I can certainly implement in class with my students; my only criticism of this book is the same criticism I had of The Five Love Languages, which is the conversational style that the author uses to advance her ideas. She either makes up or reproduces conversations that she has had with students in her classroom, but these come off sounding insincere and frankly phony. I have seen the style used in several books of this sort, so I guess that it\u2019s an as accepted form, but I don\u2019t care for it myself.

Amazing, isn't it?Because of this, Tovani really understands what's going on in a teen's head when he can read the words, but doesn't understand what the heck is going on in the text. Because she understands what is not happening in the struggling reader's mind, she is able to isolate strategies that good readers use to make sense of the words.

I liked the \"teaching points\" with how-to ideas listed at the end of each chapter, and will keep the book on hand to refer to when planning my reading workshop."}], "description": "I Read It, but I Don't Get It is a practical, engaging account of how teachers can help adolescents develop new reading comprehension skills.
