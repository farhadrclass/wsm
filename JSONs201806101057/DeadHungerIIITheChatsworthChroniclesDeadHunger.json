I want to give it 10 stars!As I said in my title this book truly deserves more than any silly 5 stars. We've had enough of silly ol' guns busting zombie melons, let's melt those bastards. that gets old fast. Ok, baseball bats! Man that is a work out! I guess guns are the way to go! Seriously, there's science in this book. This chica has no idea how accurate it is, but it sounds good. A good bad guy, that sounds kinda like he's lost it. And some butt wipes that you really get to enjoy getting their just desserts. All the extra stars? That's for all of the different stuff from the rest of the genre. The first 5 are just for being that dang good! But if you want to know like what? Go back to book 1 don't start here geeeezzz"}, {"userName": "Amanda Felix", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17820136-amanda-felix", "userReview": "Shelman has once again hit this one out of the park. The F bomb aside, Hemps/Charlie's story is just as compelling as the Gem and Flex although I think Charlie deserves her own book. We all know that in any survival/apocalypse there will always be some A hole with too much money who will throw a wrench into anyone's survival plans wanting to control what's left of the population no matter what the cost. And while he appears to be a nice enough man, amicable even, he is a man that is used to getting what he wants no matter how unreasonable the request. And no matter how you look at it Hemp has become a commodity. Ryan Carville a real estate tycoon is determined to possess that commodity, even if it means taking it by force and that means taking Hemp. Carville and his goons have been listening to the airwaves and know quite a bit about him, but they don't know the man personally and that is perhaps a mistake that Carville might live to regret. Shelman give us much needed background on Hemp and Charlie and we begin to know them, like them and cry and worry with them. There is loss that will break your heart but like the family they are, they are determined to see it through. And let's not forget Charlie! Her second half is missing and she is one determined woman and will not let a little thing like a self absorbed important-in-his-own-mind billionaire and his army of goons stop her from getting him back. This part of the chronicles is mostly much needed background on Charlie and Hemp. And new characters will be thrown in the mix with their own mystery. True Shelman style, the book will seem to run a little dry with too much Hemp in the lab explanations.. stick with it, you will not be disappointed! The lab work will make sense in the end for Hemp who, while a captive, is after all a scientist first and foremost, but one that is not afraid to fight for his freedom. And that is perhaps a very dangerous combination for anyone that thinks they can control such a man. And there is now a new way to fight the Zombies thanks to Carville's arrogance in allowing Hemp a fully functional and completely stocked laboratory. And just as you've wrapped your mind around that nugget, zombie rats are on the move and other things that will scare the hell out of you for no other book/series has yet to address that subject fully. Eric Shelman will leave you thinking and shuddering at the thought. Is it a good read.... OH YEAH!!!"}, {"userName": "Julie Greig", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31928904-julie-greig", "userReview": "Well book III sees a combo effort from our resident scientist Hemp and his lady love the ass kicking crossbow wielding Charlie.No spoilers so gotta read the book to know why this chronicle is a shared event.This book continues to follow the groups adventures; settlements, mad men with egos and a private 'army', pet zombies?!?! and another weird twist to the dead walking. It is still full of action and the potty mouthed ladies that kill Z'ds with the best of them but does let you take a breath as Hemp is a scientist. This sees him get the chance to study and experiment further, whether by choice or not..It's a slightly different pace than the first books but that fits as Hemp is the thinker - yeah he can shoot zombies, but he does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to the long term plans of killing them in greater numbers, analysing the reasons that caused the apocalypse and ways to not only fight back but to set things on the right path."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Book three is a chronicle of events told by the professor, Hemp Chatsworth. This may seem a bit redundant, but each character brings their own perception of events and circumstances particular to their own experience. We learn Hemp's history prior to the event, why he came to the city, and what he experienced prior to Alex and Gem finding him in the jail cell. Then we continue on with the story from Hemp's point of view. Hemp's chronicle is more from the scientific side of things as he is working on the serum or concoction made from poison ivy plants which kills/dissolves the zombies on contact. This book seemed a little slower due to Hemp's preoccupation and discussion of same. It's all good though as Alex, Gem, Charlie and the kids still play their parts and have much to do in the development of the tale. Three.point.five tedious stars."}, {"userName": "R Martine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34351519-r-martine", "userReview": "This is probably my favorite of the chronicles so far... Hemp and Charlie are my Peeps!!! I find I am much like Charlie and won't make excuses for myself, like or hate me, dude that's your problem! Hemp is a all out rockstar of a sexy ass genius and continues to develop life saving and ingenuous inventions. This is a tale that flip flops from Charlie to Hemp and there is a heavy and intense plot that kept me from putting this book down before I reached the end... I am not ashamed to admit that during the climactic \"wink wink Charlie\" conclusion, I cried a tear or two. Hemp and Charlie are a match made in Rock n Roll and dipped in urushiol and love and sex and the sex pistols... Don't stop now... you gotta see where the stories go!!!"}, {"userName": "Jeff Clare at atz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31912743-jeff-clare-at-atz", "userReview": "Want a book that will knock your socks off and put them back on for you? The Dead Hunger series delivers every single time. The paces are varied, which makes for a great roller coaster storyline. Author Eric Shelman is superb at writing dialogue and using it to move his stories. This is a great story of Hempstead pre and post apocalypse.
