I had mentioned to her that I was looking for more psychological thriller books to review and she suggested this one to me. I took one look at the gorgeous cover & immediately I knew I wanted to read it, once I read the synopsis I knew I just HAD to read it! A psychological thriller that was centered around a dance troupe sounded fascinating and it actually made me think of the movie Black Swan, which I loved.This is a sensuous thriller, one in which Jordan Rosenfeld thoroughly explores the often similar dynamics between dance and family life. Women in Red is the story of Stella Russo, a single mom whose dance career was put on hold in order to raise her musical prodigy daughter and to take care of her disabled mother who was once a brilliant dancer herself. When a mysterious man walks into Stella\u2019s life offering a chance to make her dream of becoming a professional dancer come true she falls right under his spell. Stella is thrust into the enigmatic world of a dance troupe that\u2019s filled with secrets and lies. Soon she finds herself having to confront her own troubled past before she loses everything and everyone that means the most to her.Women in Red is a beautifully written story, I was sucked into this fascinating world I knew virtually nothing about! I became so lost in the complex characterizations and tantalizing exploits that I forgot the story was first and foremost, a thriller. When the twists started to unfold I was caught off guard and it thrilled me even more, adding to my enjoyment of this novel. Usually I read psychological thrillers in a way that I\u2019m constantly searching for clues and red herrings so this was a completely new reading experience for me and one that I enjoyed very much! I would absolutely recommend Women in Red for fans of dark, psychological thrillers; trust me when I say that you won\u2019t be disappointed!! This is the first book I\u2019ve read by Rosenfeld and I was so impressed that it certainly won\u2019t be my last. In fact I\u2019ve already chosen Night Oracle as my next Rosenfeld read, it\u2019s also a dark psychological thriller but with some paranormal mixed in. Be on the lookout for my review :)Thank you so much to the author, Jordan Rosenfeld and to Sage\u2019s Book Tours for inviting me to participate in the Women in Red Blog Tour and for providing me with a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest review!"}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16308259-kara", "userReview": "Women in Red would earn 5 stars based solely on the beautiful storytelling of its author, Jordan E. Rosenfeld, who could have been describing something as mundane as vacuuming the house and it would have been a work of art. But the mysterious tale she weaves, full of very real and flawed characters, exotic parties and performances, sexy affairs, and imperfect relationships, manages to pull readers in right from the very first chapter.Stella is a single mother raising a musical prodigy of a daughter and supporting her disabled ex-dancer mother on a waitress's salary while daydreaming of her own short-lived dance career. When a mysterious stranger basically forces himself into her life, offering her everything she'd been longing for in the form of becoming a dancer and performer again, she is skeptical. But how can she resist? And readers will be thrilled that she doesn't as she dives into the dramatic world of a dance troupe composed of secrets, lies, and damaged individuals. The only way I could have personally enjoyed this book more is if I myself was a dancer. But overall, Women in Red is an engaging and satisfying read from beginning to end."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41011814-janet", "userReview": "I give Women in Red by Jordan Rosenfeld 5 stars.

Stella with her fire-engine red hair and her sexy boss \u2013 no guessing about that affair, but then the book takes a brilliant turn and if at all possible, the pace gets kicked up a notch.Stella moves from her job as a waitress to a dance troupe in one slick movement. She can finally pursue her dream. Although her body is in pain from performing, her spirits are lifted and soaring. While she is trying to find her place in the new dance company, her daughter is trying to find her place in life.In contrast to Stella\u2019s new life, is the life of her broken mother, former prima ballerina, Margaret. Broken dreams, broken heart and broken body, until she meets up with Max and there is a promise of good things to come. But Max wants more and Margaret cannot allow that to happen. When Max threatens her, her health suffers a negative setback.Just when you think this book will have a slow downturn towards the end, the twist of all twists happen. Stella is kidnapped and the story shoots in a different direction.The book went from inspirational, teaching us to follow our dreams, to blood, sweat and tears. In short the book kept me interested to the last page."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383239-autumn", "userReview": "http://fallenoverbookreviews.blogspot...So I won this paperback and I have to say this was a pretty decent read. It took me all week to read it and it wasn't because it wasn't good because it was, I just found myself busy.Stella is a mother and use to be dancer she holds down a job that she doesn't fully like but hey it pays the bills and for her daughter's violin. When she gets the offer to join a very secretive dance troupe she does it as she knows it will be better pay and plus she will be able to dance once again. Though it seems that everyone around Stella including herself have secrets that no one wants to have others know. There isn't really much suspense just secrets from different characters that will be finally brought to light. I have to say Stella's daughter Izzy I was impressed with her she is a young girl who can play the violin and she is a bit sneaky when it comes to wanting to find out who her father is. Which I give her props on doing that and how she did it. Most of the action comes towards the end when the dance troupe and Stella's world collides. Everything comes to the surface and why Julian really wants Stella to be a part of his world this is when a nice twist comes into play.Overall a good read, the plot was a steady, and the characters were good."}, {"userName": "Russell Ricard", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56098598-russell-ricard", "userReview": "Jordan Rosenfeld's novel, WOMEN IN RED is a fantastic read!My take: It's about a former ballet dancer who finds herself in a dangerous underworld, navigating an eerie cast of characters, as she rediscovers her love of dance.It's a real page-turner; sensual prose that's both lush, yet streamlined. And Ms. Rosenfeld plays, adeptly, with the reader's expectations--there are many plot twists.The story offers mystery, thrills (chills, too), and engages all the senses. At the same time, at the heart of the story are universal themes; at its core, WOMEN IN RED is a journey of a woman's search for connection, for family.A very fulfilling read!"}], "description": "Dead-broke single mother Stella Russo, daughter of a world-class prima ballerina, has nearly given up on her own professional aspirations\u2014much less true love\u2014when a dazzling impromptu stunt by a mysterious troupe reminds her just how empowering performing onstage can be.
