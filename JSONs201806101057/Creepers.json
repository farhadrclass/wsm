Quite appropriate, since the ivy \"twisting up the trunks of the trees and dribbling across the lawn\" was the first thing that Courtney noticed when she arrived at her new home - a Puritan era house next door to a centuries old cemetery. The ivy seems to have a mind of its own as the days go by and Courtney can practically watch it grow. The cemetery also catches Courtney's interest, especially when she notices a father and daughter who repeatedly visit the same grave.Creepers is a Gothic mystery, a tale introducing early teens to history and activism, spirituality and life beyond the grave. The author does a fantastic job of making things just scary enough, planting doubts that what we see is all there is. The plot is accessible for younger teens but still engaging enough for adults who like the genre - and Dahme doesn't just spit out the answers at us, things are left unsaid to let our imaginations take a turn. Courtney is a believable teenager who finds herself suddenly very interested in the past and how it intertwines with the present. I love how the author uses different media to make the past come alive - letters, journals and newspaper articles. Even the pages have a green tint and the occasional picture that make the book's Gothic feel even more apparent.I think this is a great pick for mother-daughter book groups or for teen reading. I know I'll be holding on to my copy until my own daughter is ready to read it with me."}, {"userName": "Terry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1372034-terry", "userReview": "I was enticed to read this story by the intriguing book cover, interesting ivy illustrations throughout the book, and the summary on the book jacket. While the illustrations and book cover are good, the book jacket summary was somewhat misleading as to its description of the story. Even if the story had been exactly as described, it still suffered from several major problems. Firstly, the author is too exact when she describes distances. That wouldn't necessarily be a problem, except that the author doesn't seem to grasp the enormity of the distances she's using. On several occasions, the author has the main character see things going on 500 yards away. Really? That's a huge distance. Try standing 5 football fields away from something and tell me if you can describe it in detail. Pretty tough, unless you're using binoculars. Secondly, the plot largely revolves around the proposed development of cemetery plots, which would involve some exhumation of burials. While I have not done any research on Massachusetts law in particular (where the story takes place), most states, counties, and/or municipalities have statutes or ordinances that protect cemeteries, particularly the exhumation of burials and cemeteries with historic interest (as this one has - it's a Puritan cemetery). I cannot imagine a developer wanting to buy cemetery plots when other land exists that would take fewer permits and exceptions to develop, such as the cornfield across the street in the story. Thirdly, digging up a burial by the main characters? That most certainly would be illegal or at least require lots of paperwork and permits, though the main characters ignore this fact, and the author dismisses this problem by having one of the characters summarily say, \"Of course it's legal.\" Fourthly, when they dig up one of the dead people, who has supposedly been dead for hundreds of years, the person is actually still there! And there's even paper in the coffin for them to read! This is amazing stuff, considering that the coffin and body should under normal circumstances be reduced to a carbon stain in the ground by then. The author doesn't even address this anomaly. Finally, all of the supernatural stuff is supposed to be so the long-deceased father can be \"reunited\" with his dead daughter. It isn't entirely clear, but it seems like the father's actions (such as not telling the witch where the girl was buried) worked against him getting exactly what he wanted, reunited with his daughter. This story had great potential, but the author didn't seem to know how to handle the plot very convincingly. Her editor should have demanded rewrites and fact-checked basic (and important) plot points. Hopefully the next book will be better, though I won't trust what the book jacket says about the story as being entirely accurate."}, {"userName": "Lexie Williams", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25223460-lexie-williams", "userReview": "This book was terrible. The characters are as complex as cardboard. We have our main character, Courtney, she has just moved into a house with her parents next to a cemetery. This was trying to be a horror book, my first horror book, it was boring, stupid and forgettable. Courtney meets a girl her age named Margret and her dad Christian. An ancestor of theirs lived in the house Courtney had just moved into, the daughter of the man who lived there had died and he made a deal with a witch to bring her back, the witch planted ivy around the cemetery trying to find her body, but her body isn't where it should be. This has cursed the entire family, so until the ivy finds the body, the entire family is cursed, what is the curse? Well it wasn't explained, something about people not being able to see them, but they never go in depth into it, this could have helped the story, but nope, it is glanced over. The whole reason they are looking for the body is GLANCED OVER! The plot is terrible, there was so much potential with this plot, but there was no suspense nor fear. I don't even understand the title, but thats beside the point. I won't reveal the ending, but believe me it is not worth it. The pacing is terrible, the book makes me feel stupid, they have to go in depth to little things, as if i cant understand subtlety, but it barley touches the mayor plot points. The book made me feel dumb, the plot was dumb, and when it ended nothing felt resolved. Sure the conflict was resolved, but what was the point? Overall this book was a waste of my time, i beg everyone to not TOUCH this book."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10827825-sharon", "userReview": "\"Nature does not heed our hourglass,\" - Christian Geyer.The title of this book does little justice to the fantastic tale that is found within its beautiful cover. Before I go any further I must mention the book. The person responsible for the design of it had a masterstroke of genius. The beautiful green cover is adorned with a tombstone inscription of Prudence Geyer (the character the book is based around). On the back, ivy vines are spreading from the edge.When you open the book is when the magic starts. You find a map of the area surrounding Courtney's house. Every page is tinted with a hint of green to give the impression the ivy could appear at any time as it does in the story and it does. As the story builds in suspense ivy winds its way across the page. To add even more atmosphere to this intriguing tale. Each chapter starts with an article from the local paper \"The Murmur Mercury\" and pictures of a young girl, the cemetery and the surrounding area are placed throughout. If you are planning to read this book I would suggest buying a physical copy as an e-book would not provide the magic that a physical copy does. Some books have to be physically held to experience them.The story itself is a well written YA tale. All characters are strong well written and they have a presence that demands you get to know them. I stayed awake until the early hours of the morning as I just could not stop reading. It was as if the ivy that spreads everywhere in the book had grabbed hold of me demanding that I discover what happened to Prudence, her father and the witch. It truly has something magical about it. A tale of ghosts, diary entries from a broken-hearted father and the ever-present ivy. It will grab readers of any age and hold them until the truth is finally revealed."}, {"userName": "Alea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134374-alea", "userReview": "13 year old Courtney has just moved to town with her parents, the first thing she notices about her new house is the abundance of ivy covering it, (no matter how much ivy her father removes it just comes right back) also the cemetery next door. In the cemetery Courtney meets Margaret Geyer and her father Christian, they give tours of the cemetery. Soon they share a secret with Courtney, they have relative, Prudence, that is supposed to be resting in the cemetery but they know her body is not there. Prudence and her father, also Christian once lived in Courtney's house. When young Prudence died her father was beside himself and allowed a witch to try and help him bring Prudence back to life. But where is Prudence? And is the Ivy trying to tell Courtney something? This is the story of Courtney and the Geyer's quest to find Prudence and reunite her with her father, even in death. This is a sweet little mysterious story, a great summer or fall read for junior high aged kids. Courtney senses something different about Margaret and Christian Geyer but can't quite put her finger on it, I think readers will have a fun time guessing just what is up with these two characters. I'll tell you this, I guessed wrong! I found the ending a little too vague for my own tastes. And not all my questions were totally answered. But who knows, maybe that was the point. Not everything always has to be wrapped up neatly. Each chapter is started with a news clipping, or other piece of information that helps piece the puzzle together. There are also several images throughout the book and pages of the 1st Christian Geyer's diary. I really liked that aspect of the books design, it created a world for this story to take place within. To compliment the abundance of ivy (a character itself) in the book there is ivy growing on the pages of the book! Very smart book design!"}, {"userName": "Cindy Hudson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903478-cindy-hudson", "userReview": "Courtney O'Brien has just moved with her parents into the small New England town of Murmer where they've bought an old home next to a cemetery. The first thing she notices is the ivy, which covers everything from the house to the gravestones and seems to have a life of its own. Then she meets Margaret and her dad, who conducts historical tours of the cemetery. From them Courtney learns about a centuries-old mystery involving Margaret's ancestors, the cemetery and Courtney's house. Together they work to unlock the secrets hidden behind the ivy.I had a hard time putting this book down once I got started. It's easy to transport yourself to a small New England town of old where messages were carved into headstones and witches were burned at the stake. I also started noticing English Ivy everywhere: clawing its way up tree trunks, crawling across lawns, clinging to the sides of buildings. Creepers is fast-paced, and each chapter starts with a diary entry, newspaper story, community announcement or definition that keeps the book moving along and adds something to the mystery. Creepers is my kind of suspense novel: it's wonderfully creepy and it gave me goosebumps without being gory or making me afraid to go to sleep at night. I think it makes a great mother-daughter book club read."}, {"userName": "Ti", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122928-ti", "userReview": "This ghost story has all the right elements. A spooky house with a lot of history, a cemetery right next door, odd neighbors and the creeping ivy that has a mind of its own. I have been super busy this week so my time with this novel has been limited to late nights on the couch, all by myself. Let me tell you, I was spooked quite a few times and kept seeing things out of the corner of my eye. As far as the story goes, I enjoyed the main character. Courtney is a girl I could get to know. That said, some of the other characters could have been a bit more developed. Their mysteriousness added to the story, but I wanted just a little bit more in the way of character development. Additionally, the story really centered around just a few people. While reading I felt completely isolated. Perhaps a bit more information about the town itself would have helped draw me into their world. This is a Young Adult novel and I think kids between the ages of 10-12 find this book to be a real page turner. Thanks to Booking Mama and Running Press for sending it to me.

The Geyers inform Courtney that the house was once inhabited by Christian Geyer and his daughter, Prudence. Tragically, Prudence died young.

The ivy is so much a part of the house and the adjoining plot that it almost breathes. She meets a father daughter duo who appear to be caretakers of the folk lore and history of the cemetery. It's more a sweet story than a scary story. As a junior high student, I would have loved this book. I read many community reviews which reviewed this book poorly. I think they are wrong. Sometimes as adults reading children's or YA literature we don't view the book through their eyes. The audience is for children not an adult.

Das Haus am zweihundert Jahre alten Memento-Mori Friedhofs hat so seine Eigenarten. Zum Beispiel ist es \u00fcberwuchert von hartn\u00e4ckigem Efeu, den der Vater von Courtney immer wieder vergeblich versucht zu entfernen. Nicht lange nach der Ankunft im neuen Zuhause, begegnet sie den etwas seltsamen aber freundlichen Zeitgenossen Mr.Geyer und Tochter Margaret. Die beiden erz\u00e4hlen ihr bei einer F\u00fchrung \u00fcber den Friedhof, welche sie zu den unheimlich verzierten Gr\u00e4bern f\u00fchrt, von Prudence. Prudence war eine Vorfahrin von den beiden und verstarb vor etwa zweihundert Jahren im Kindesalter. Sie lebte mit ihrem Vater auf dem Grundst\u00fcck, auf dem nun auch Courtney lebt. Margaret und ihr Vater weihen sie St\u00fcck f\u00fcr St\u00fcck in ihre Familiengeheimnisse ein. Courtney ist fasziniert von diesen mythischen Geschichten und bietet ihre Hilfe an, einen Jahrhundert w\u00e4hrenden Fluch zu brechen. Doch dieser hat nicht nur das Haus und Friedhof mit Efeu befallen. Etwas geschieht auch IM Haus... Nicht nur das \u00c4u\u00dfere dieses Buches ist einfach klasse, sondern das Innenleben haut wirklich vom Hocker. Viele Seiten sind mit Efeuranken best\u00fcckt, die Seitenr\u00e4nder in leichtem Gr\u00fcn. Vor jedem neuen Kapitel kommen beispielsweise Zeitungsausschnitte, die ebenfalls ganz in Gr\u00fcn gehalten sind, da die Farbe und der dazugeh\u00f6rige Efeu eben ein ganz gro\u00dfer Teil des Buches sind. Wenn man den Aufbau also betrachtet, ist das Buch perfekt. Mich w\u00fcrde es freuen, wenn alle B\u00fccher so m\u00fchevoll aufgearbeitet werden w\u00fcrden. Durch die Ich-Perspektive bekommt man nat\u00fcrlich eine sehr dichte Bindung zu Courtney, obwohl mir bei ihr doch die Charakterz\u00fcge fehlten. Sie blieb f\u00fcr mich sehr blass und am Ende wusste ich nicht mal mehr, wie sie denn \u00fcberhaupt aussah. Margaret und Mr.Geyer waren etwas seltsame Gestalten, die um einiges dichter beschrieben wurden. Man sp\u00fcrte, dass sie anders waren und das ist f\u00fcr mich schon mal ein sehr positives Punkt, dass das geschah, ohne viel Beschreibungen, und dass man immer wieder darauf hingewiesen wird. Auch die Eltern von Courtney waren sehr angenehme Personen.Der Stil der Autorin ist einfach und fl\u00fcssig zu lesen. Schwer zu erkl\u00e4ren ist f\u00fcr mich der Spannungspunkt. Es ist nicht so, dass es wirklich richtig spannend war. Die Atmosph\u00e4re war eher ganz ruhig und idyllisch. Und doch irgendwie knisternd. Man sp\u00fcrte immer, es ist irgendwas. Und aus diesem Grunde las man weiter, ohne viel nachzudenken. Aber so richtig spannend war es halt nie. Doch der Punkt ist ja, dass ich trotzdem immer weiterlas und mich in dem Buch wirklich wohl f\u00fchlte. Deswegen war es f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack eigentlich ganz gut.

The house and yard have been inundated by persistent ivy, that grows and creeps everywhere. Even though her father constantly removes it, the ivy seems to have a purpose and intent of its own. Billed as a young adult novel, the book features not only the creepy and creeping ivy, it also has the required mysterious neighbors, scary noises in the basement and ghostly visitors who carve ivy into the basement walls. Learning of the history of the cemetery and the secrets contained within her new home, Courtney attempts to break the centuries old spell cast upon her new enigmatic neighbors. I\u2019m not much of a reader of young adult novels, but I received this Advanced Reader copy from the publisher and thought I\u2019d give it a quick read. The heroine is likable, with the required fortitude to occasionally skirt parental rules that all characters in teen fiction must have. The story itself contains just enough of a creepiness factor to keep the story moving along, but not so much that it would freak out a younger reader. The setting of the story is so appealing, that I wished more than once that I could find a house like that, cemetery and all. That said though, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a book for the young adult audience its trying to reach. The characters were a bit too simplified; their dialogue and emotions a bit too bland even for younger teens. The plot was also pretty elementary and not all that suspense filled. I would recommend this book for kids 10 to 12 years old, especially the kids who like the idea of a ghost story, but would get bad dreams if they read a really scary one.

One of his running jokes is that Archie comics are really written by a computer that has been programmed with all sorts of facts about teenage life but doesn't really understand organic life forms, so the jokes are always a bit off. That's sort of how I felt about this book. Supposedly narrated by a tween, it was so stilted and inexplicably formal and odd . . . I wondered if the author had ever been a teen or had talked to teens. And, to make it worse, the narration drew attention to the oddities. The entire book was written in this odd, almost Victorian, super-adult style, and then the narrator says of another young character \"She talks like an adult\". This coming from a character who mentions the \"perspiration\" on someone's forehead! And at one point the narrator responds to her mother by \"trying to sound annoyed\" Why? It's like the author heard that teenagers are often sullen and annoyed and felt like that should be part of the story.Maybe my big complaint with this book, though, is that it treats the reader as though they aren't smart--not smart enough to follow the plot and not smart enough to demand good writing. The story is called \"Creepers\" and ivy plays an important role . . . this does NOT mean that the author needs to use the word \"ivy\" 23 times in the first six pages. Teens are younger than us . . . not mental! They will get that the ivy is important. I think this is the bad thing about Twilight that nobody ever talks about . . . that publishers and authors think that because one overblown, badly-edited, melodramatic book was embraced by teens, they can get sloppy.

The inside of the book is just as attractive with the pages edged in soft green and each chapter beginning with an interesting article or letter from the past.Courtney is the narrator and she and her parents move to a new home one summer in Murmur, Massachusetts. The first thing they noticed when they saw their large stone house built in the 1700's was the English ivy that clung to it. A bit unusual since it was also next to a very old Puritan cemetery. Courtney soon meets a man and his daughter who give historical tours in the cemetery. They supply many details about the surrounding area and the history behind the traditions and the carvings of the tombstones. The duo is also able to tell her about her house and how it was built on the foundation of the original which burned during a tragic fire. Now the house is suppose to be haunted with a family that needs to be reunited. Although she finds the story hard to believe she is constantly finding more indications that there may be some truth to it all. What should she believe and what should she do? Why does the ivy seem to be watching her every move? Although this is written for young adults it is an interesting story for any age.

It's definitely not a keeper.On to the review. The reason i gave two stars was because to me, the writing wasn't too bad and i appreciated the newspaper and letter bits. I thought that was a very nice touch. It also had a few moments of suspense which were good, but unfotunately, those only left me feeling frustrated with the outcomes.But the story itself is so terribly BORING. It had a sloppy plot, characters that don't really do much and a ghost which doesn't scare. I kept on reading this book hoping that the BOO SCARED YA part was coming but it never did. Is Creepers supposed to be a ghost story in the first place? I mean, yea sure there's a ghost but it doesn't seem to do anything much except float around. The book wasn't even a LITTLE scary. I couldn't find any parts that frightened me at all! And after reading the book, it just left me with questions like; Huh?, Thats's it?, Really?, Really!?, Or did i just miss the whole idea? So, you get the picture. It's kinda sad though, because this book had a potential to become a really interesting book if it was better planned and plotted.Would i recommend Creepers?

Her writing during moments of horror is slow and deliberate, forcing your eye to read the next line when what you really want is to skip to the next page to see what happened. I also think it's a very effective type of horror for a YA title, all very psychological, very \"am I the only one who saw that?\".So while I don't recommend this book, I'd say keep an eye out for Dahme, if she cleans up the plots and loose ends, she may be the next big YA horror writer."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2967048-elizabeth", "userReview": "I received this book as an advanced reader's copy and was asked to write a review of it. I then promptly lost the book and just found it when cleaning out a closet. Oops.I don't think it's fair to completely pan this book. It was a simple, light read, meant for a young adult. I often delve into young adult fiction. I think there are a lot of YA books that are simply meant for all ages (think: The Giver). This isn't one of them.My adult mind just couldn't wrap itself around much of this book. I kept getting caught up in the things that just seemed implausible and not the story. It was cute and predictable. I would have loved it if I was ten or eleven years old. I hesitated to even give it a star rating and so just might remove that. I think it's a good first effort for this author and I wouldn't wish that my star rating kept anyone of the right age from this book."}, {"userName": "Z", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1205907-z", "userReview": "The voice of this book was very odd. Supposedly narrated by a twelve-year-old, or so, it sounded more like an adult was narrating. Or at least someone more mature than a twelve-year-old. Still, it wasn't that the language was particularly difficult. The voice was odd in a way that's hard to pin down.This was how the whole book went, which, besides the part with the narration, was a good thing. Creepers could be categorized as a ghost story, but I see it as more of a mystery with supernatural elements. These were dealt with well, with an air of oddity that suited them.Overall, I quite liked the book. It certainly had a unique atmosphere to it, though it might not be what you're looking for. Plus, I like graveyards."}, {"userName": "Cher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1234691-cher", "userReview": "Halfway through this novel, I'm wanting to say it's a short story gone on way too long. I get absolutely no sense of who the main character really is, which is disappointing as it is a ghost story mystery told in first person. All I can say is: I'm hoping there'll be a nice twist to make reading this worthwhile and I'm hoping it'll involve character transformation for the main character or I'll be rather disappointed.Nope. Book never got better. One minor surprise only. A feel-good ghost story that ran on for hundreds of pages too long. Great ideas, but it should have been a short story. Great art included as well, but it all looks like classic photography-- not sure, couldn't tell from the credits."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth *Swords for Fighting*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3114254-elizabeth-swords-for-fighting", "userReview": "Creepers was not a very creepy story. I was expecting a sort of thriller with some scary aspects, but it fell short for me. In fact, some parts of the book were kind of boring. The story definitely had some interesting parts, but they never really caught my attention enough to where I was absorbed in the story.One of the things I did not like was that the main character, Courtney, did not really act like a thirteen year old girl. The way she acted and spoke made her seem far older at times. Another problem with this book was the writing. I noticed many grammar errors and overall the writing was just sloppy. Creepers had potential, but it did not reach it."}, {"userName": "Laume", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016046-laume", "userReview": "I really really wanted to like this book. It has a lovely cover and beautiful artistic images and \"additions\" (pages that read like newspaper clippings, old journal pages, letters...) throughout the book. It was a really clever story idea. I did make it all the way through the book and there were a few aspects of the story that had me guessing 'til the end but sadly it reads like a rough draft that no one bothered asking the author to make sense of or tighten, and the sloppy writing and unrealistic timeline kept tripping me up all the way through the book."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1673447-angie", "userReview": "begin: the book itself intrigues me: a textured dust jacket, a map inside the covers, ivy-decorated pages, some black and white pictures, and even a fade in coloring on the edges of each page. can't wait to get to the story!end: story was not what i had hoped. it was not very sophisticated, although it would probably work well for someone in late elementary to early middle school. the story premise was a good one, just not carried out as smoothly as i had anticipated. the look of the book was still a pleasure to experience."}, {"userName": "Rebekah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2735724-rebekah", "userReview": "An old stone house next to a cemetery...
