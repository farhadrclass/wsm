That's what I'm calling it, since there's nothing else that quite fits this original novel.Braineater wakes up dead in a pool. With me so far? He's on a mission to find out who he was, why he's dead and a number of other things. (Seriously, he has a numbered list of questions to which he's trying to find answers.) To accomplish this, he needs to keep drinking alcohol, because that's what keeps Braineaters like him fresh. Will he get the answers he seeks? You'll have to read this, (or listen to it), to find out!I found myself laughing out loud quite a bit while listening to this on audio. The creativity of both the story and the narrator are amazing. The characters-a dude in a jar, a dude that's just a head, (HILARIOUS!), mix and match prostitutes, (you'll see), are CRAZY fun and the voices that Steve Rimpici comes up with for them are absolutely perfect. I highly recommend the audio book of Braineater Jones. It's funny, imaginative and entertaining. What more can you ask for from Zombie Noir? *This audio was provided free of charge as part of a Sponsored Group Listen in the Horror Aficionados group at Goodreads.

Stop by and say hey.I listened to a copy of the audiobook provided by the author for the  Horror Aficionados Sponsored Group Listen. Please feel free to join us!It\u2019s the 1930\u2019s and a man wakes up in a pool with a big hole in his chest and no memory of what transpired the night before. But he\u2019s not exactly a man anymore . . . He manages to track down more of his \u201ckind\u201d and learns that he needs booze to keep his brain from turning to complete mush. But booze costs money and his money is dwindling fast. He becomes known as \u201cBraineater Jones\u201d, PI for the dead who are still walking around. Surprisingly enough, he finds tons of work and has little time left to crack his own case. Who plugged him and why? He seems like a nice enough guy, he thinks, but he doesn\u2019t really remember.This book is a mashup of a noir, hard-boiled detective type of story set in a world where the dead don\u2019t die. I\u2019ll be honest and tell you I\u2019m not a big fan of the noir but this story is a riot and would make a fun movie that I\u2019d pay to watch. It is seriously funny and has some kooky ideas about body parts that actually made me laugh. I never do that. The narrator reads the story with such joy and enthusiasm that it\u2019s infectious and his voices are hilarious. It\u2019s sometimes gross but a zany kind of gross. \u201cHe made a noise like a big wad of oatmeal getting sucked up a puckered anus.\u201d If you need a laugh and like something just a little off kilter, I\u2019m pretty certain this one will do the trick.

This is said review.Another new one on me. Never heard of Stephen Kozeniewski before he sent me this through Confessions, for a review. I love it when new authors (to me) take the time to contact me and push their stuff for a review. You sometimes get stuff that, to be honest, I put down after a page or two. Sometimes you get stuff like this. Looks a bit bizarre and maybe not in your normal reading piles but worth a shot. Imagine my surprise when I noticed Mr Kozeniewski\u2019s name in an anthology I started to read at the same time. Coincidence? I think more fate. After reading Braineater Jones I\u2019m going to jump straight to his story in the anthology. He is rather bloody good.A man awakes face down in a swimming pool. Well, he doesn\u2019t really wake up. That\u2019s because he is dead. The huge hole in his chest sort of points to that. He has no idea where he is, who he is, what happened to him or where he needs to go. He adopts the name of Braineater Jones and sets about tracking down his killer. His only friend, it appears, is an \u201cundead\u201d like himself. Problem is, he is only a head with no body and pretty useless in a bar brawl.After discovering that the only thing that will keep him from craving the human flesh he is naturally attracted to is alcohol, Jones and the head embark on a mission to find a constant supply of booze, solve a few cases as PI\u2019s and find Jones\u2019 killer before their time runs out.First question \u2013 how to categorise this? That is such a hard question. The story is set in November 1934. You read the story through the eyes of Jones, reading his entries in his own personal journal from 31st October through until 1st December. Each day describes what has happened to him and the \u201chead\u201d in their quest for booze and answers. That is really all I want to give you on the plot itself because you need to read this to follow the journey yourself. You really need to read it!It\u2019s noir. It\u2019s horror. It\u2019s dark fiction. It\u2019s full of dark humour. Most of all this is just pure, absolute fun. I absolutely loved it.The atmosphere is perfect. You have a dark, almost smokey feeling which sets the scene perfectly. You can imagine Bogart or someone of that era playing parts in this story. Every time someone walks into a bar you can sense the music playing in the background, the sights, and the smells. It stinks of the 30\u2019s during prohibition.That\u2019s what absolutely makes this book. You have to remember at points that the main character is a zombie for crying out loud. We only see zombies in modern day movies that leave a lot to be desired. I noticed someone say they could see this made into a film with Bruce Campbell as Jones. I couldn\u2019t think of anything more perfect. This would become a cult film. This should become a cult book. It is that good.Zombies that walk and talk and think and have their own place in society as long as they drink alcohol! I want to be a zombie in the 1930\u2019s.Hidden within the main story are little snippets of side stories that bring you back to reality. There are Nazi\u2019s in this. Americans collaborating with Nazi\u2019s just before the Second World War. Whether intentional or not, it examines the culture of that time period. The racism, the homophobia, the language used, talking about women as dames and reminding them of their place in society. It\u2019s not in your face but it does remind you of how it must have been to live in those times.And it has zombies!!! In the 1930\u2019s!To summarise: It has zombies! In the 1930\u2019s! This is not your typical zombie story. I loved that fact. It oozes noir. It oozes atmosphere. It is a horror of sorts but if you are expecting jump out of your seat scary, then it is not. It is very dark with a lot of dark humour. It will make you cringe and laugh at the same time. It will make you root for the underdog. It\u2019s just good fun and well worth the time it will take you to read it.I for one cannot wait for more from Mr Kozeniewski.General rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Absolutely loved it and it comes highly recommended.Horror rating:\u2605\u2605\u2605 Creepy but could have had more."}, {"userName": "Shana Festa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185553-shana-festa", "userReview": "So, admittedly, I didn\u2019t read the synopsis, look at the cover or even have an inkling what this book was about when I started to read it. I was assigned this novel and judging by the title, I expected it to be comical. Three percent through \u2026 I said, \u201cStop. What am I reading?\u201dNow, don\u2019t take that as a bad sign, I asked this question with a smile on my face. After all, I was expecting a typical zombie novel with a slight Shawn of the Dead or Zombieland slant to it.Braineater Jones is far from typical. I looked up the book and caught glimpse of cover and that was all, really, I needed to know. I started the novel again. It has a Foreword and honestly, I never read any Foreword until I get through a few chapters. Just a weird thing, especially if I see it is an \u2018explanation\u2019 from the author. I take that mindset of \u2018Let me read first and then I\u2019ll hear what you want to explain\u2019. I don\u2019t like anything being put in my head.Off I went, diving into this story with a brand new mindset. It reminded me, in a positive way, of one of those \u2018dime story detective\u2019 novels or a film noire shot and narrated by a slick guy with a deep bite and hook to his voice. Complete with that trouble starting Dame every old school mystery has.Braineater Jones wakes up, or doesn\u2019t wake, he\u2019s dead, at the bottom of a pool. He opens his eyes and so our story begins. He wonders what the heck is going on and is determined to find out not only what happened to him but who he is. He can\u2019t remember.After a run-in with some thugs, he goes to some sleezy, two bit hotel. There he meets Lazar and we get more information about the new way of life or unlife that Braineater faces.His journey to the truth is documented in diary entries. And you read each one with that voice in your head. Braineater dives into the community of undead, and learns that you can keep your brain working and body from dripping flesh if you pickle your brain. That is done with alcohol.The story takes a different perspective, and a fresh one (no pun intended toward corpses). Its twists and turns weave a great and unique mystery as you follow Braineater Jones through his own path of uncovery with plenty of obstacles and bad guys that want him more dead.The novel is witty, intense and keeps your interest from start to finish. It reads fast, I mean super fast and not that the book is short, it just reads that well. Nothing stumbled me. And that rarely happens. While some Zombie snobs may not like this book, I certainly did.I can\u2019t for the life of me think of any reason to give this book less than five stars. Stephen Kozeniewski has crafted a very well written novel, it\u2019s crisp, funny, mysterious and just darned good. He is a writing force to be reckoned with and I think I\u2019ll nickname him \u2018The Koz\u2019, as his superstar author name, because I am certain if he keeps this up, he\u2019ll get there.And to steal a little line from his book, Thank Jesus, Murphy, and Joe Hooker that fellow \u2018Koz\u2019, he\u2019s got another Zombie book out.

I had seen SO many movies and read SO many books that were all pretty much the same, that I had sworn off the lot - and was avoiding dystopian as well, since so many authors seem to believe that zombies and dystopian go hand-in-hand. I was absolutely sure that there was no one who was going to be able to come up with something new and fresh, something exciting and out of the ordinary... That's when I stumbled upon this book. As usually happens with me on Amazon (and Pinterest - my apologies to anyone who follows me there), I was looking at one thing and ended up, thirty minutes later, looking at the cover of this book. It completely caught my attention and, after reading the book description, I knew I needed to try this out. Maybe it's been done before, but I hadn't seen a zombie PI from back in the 30s and this grabbed my attention on so many levels. I mean, I'm a big fan of mysteries and noir, so how could this be bad?Trust me - it wasn't.The main character, Braineater, is pretty awesome. He's sarcastic as hell, and I have this thing about sarcastic main characters. He's new at this whole zombie thing, having recently died, and there are a lot of things to get used to (not even including the fact that their bodies start to change after awhile). Throughout the book, he has some small mysteries that he tries to solve with his new PI business, tries to figure out who murdered him, avoid getting into trouble (which he's not always successful at) - and he meets some crazy characters along the way. The story itself is so good. The mystery of his murder - and the truths that he finds out along the way - are really thought out and well written. And you can tell that he knows a lot about this era (or did a lot of research) - the terms he uses, as well as social and behavioral points he touches on in his story.My favorite part of the whole book is the brothel. Wow! It was so out there and different - and absolutely hilarious. And I love the \"guy\" that Braineater ends up partnering with.Considering the different genres that this book could fall under, I can see a lot of different readers liking this book. And it's definitely recommended - this is going on The Gal's best read list this year and I wish it hadn't taken me so long to read it."}, {"userName": "Ms. Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3291712-ms-nikki", "userReview": "Braineater Jones woke up dead in a pool, thus beginning his new un-life. Braineater isn't his real name, it's what un-dead people like him are called when they don't have enough liquor in them to keep them fresh. Without the alcohol they start to deteriorate, fleshy bits start to slip right off, and are soon likely to go for your brains. So, he's kinda like those people you find at the morgue with a toe-tag named John Doe.I'm getting sidetracked.Jones keeps a journal full of questions he needs answers to, such as; Who am I? Who killed me? How do braineaters live?In this new world, while on his quest to get the answers he craves, Jones needs money to supply him with lodgings and the liquor he needs. An offer is made for Jones to help out others like him by basically becoming a private eye of sorts.Jones is heavy-handed servicing his new clients and doesn't make too many friends on his way to enlightenment. When he starts to question the wrong characters, the bad guys get wind and Jones' new un-dead life becomes a lonely one.I really enjoyed the dark humor layered throughout this read which elicited many a chuckle from me. One-liners and un-dead drama such as needing a bedpan to catch the food you eat as it drains from your neck are just one of the many things that kept me smiling till the last page.The next time I want someone to go away I'll use this line from the book: \"Why don't you make like a whore and blow?\"The author was creative with his brand of the walking dead and I don't have anything negative/constructive to say, which is a big deal coming from me.

It could have failed horribly but it was actually the perfect choice. Steve Rimpici had me cracking up, and yet somehow managed to still get me invested in the story.Braineater Jones was an entertaining listen both for the story and the narration. While the basic idea of a dead guy walking and investigating what happened to him has been done before (Down Solo), the twists that the author put on it were refreshingly unique. I enjoyed seeing how things were going to play out and found myself constantly surprised. There was a section at the end that I re-wound and listened to like three times just to make sure I was perfectly clear on what had happened. A hazard of driving and listening, I guess.This is not a book to listen to if you are easily offended. There are multiple elements that could offend. If you are sensitive to abortions/miscarriages/thoughts of dead babies, you may want to give this a pass. However, I've lost a child, and I had no problem with it.

Our most loyal and beloved readers know this, as do the many authors who've passed pitch letters for that genre our way. But pulpy crime noir involving... zombies? Uh, heck yeaaaah, pass that bad boy over here!The last time I read anything of this ilk was back during the 2011 BEA, when I was kidnapped and brainwashed (just kidding, sort of) by scientology's publishing arm into taking a review copy of Dead Men Kill. What turned Hubbard's predictably canned and corny detective story into a rather fun and rompy read was the fact that it had zombies. Death by the hands of your recently deceased secretary?! Count me in.The only other time I tried reading a spin on the hard-boiled detective novel was A Lee Martinez's The Automatic Detective, and that one, though written in classic noir style, was set in the future and featured a robot protagonist. So yeah, you see where my reading tastes lie, right?I feel no shame in admitting that that's what sold me on Stephen Kozeniewski's pitch for his retro crime-noir Braineater Jones. Ok, so the title is a little... cheesy and the cover is a little... tacky but seriously, we're talking a crime noir novel where a ZOMBIE PRIVATE EYE is investigating his own death. The title HAS to be cheesy and the cover HAS to be tacky! It's so bad it's good, ya know? Hell, it's better than good. It's fricken tops. And it's set during the prohibition so the entire novel is peppered through with good ole 1930's lingo.So here's the lowdown: The novel kicks off with our protagonist floating face down and naked in a swimming pool. He's dead and he has no memory of why or who did him in, though he can pretty well tell how as he fingers the big ole hole in his chest:\"I woke up dead this morning... Not dead drunk. Dead. Dead dead. As in no pulse, no breathing, dead as a doornail dead... dead is tough. But dead and still thinking means I've got a chance.\"His first order of business, finding the guys who killed him. Then, figuring out why he's become a braineater. Actually, he'd be cool with answers to either at this point. So he starts by logging all of his questions in a journal - Who was the hatchet man? Why did they bump me off? Who or what was I before I died? Why can't I remember anything from before I died? What am I? And are there others like me? - and begins to search the property for clues. Before he gets very far, he's chased by two men with guns, ending up in an alley in a bad part of town. And here is where our Braineater Jones starts to get some answers...Told from the eternally hopeful POV of Braineater himself, we're pulled deep into the underbelly of The Welcome Mat, a dark and dangerous place where the rest of the dead hang out, pickling their brains with alcohol (a very effective way of staving off the rigor mortis and quieting their innate hunger for flesh). There, he meets Lazar - a mysterious man who promises to keep Braineater's whistle whet for a price; a troublesome dame who smells like nothing but trouble from the start; and Alcide, who quickly becomes his severed head sidekick. Oh yeah. A fucking severed head you guys.Nothing is as it seems and every answer only seems to create more questions for our wise crackin' protag. But come hell or high water, Jones won't give up until he gets to the bottom of things, or until he ends up double-dog dead. Whichever comes first.Stephen Koseniewski pulls us along, page after page, leaving us just as clueless as his narrator. We know only what Jones knows as he comes to know it, the truth of his murder and the origins of the walking deaders unfolding before our eyes at the same time.An incredibly well written and brain-tickling read, Braineater Jones aims to hit you in both the heart and the funny bone. Super hard core zombie lit fans might find the liberties Stephen takes with his undead a little too much to bear, however for this reader, it certainly hits its marks."}, {"userName": "Kristen Burns", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42225826-kristen-burns", "userReview": "4 StarsFull Review:*I received a free ecopy of this book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.*Most of the zombies I read about are the mindless, infected, and/or shambling kind. But I much prefer my non-human creatures to be main characters in books rather than monsters to be killed, so having a zombie protagonist this time made me all excited, and for good reason because this was such a unique, creative take on the creatures!See, in this version, they\u2019re still fully functioning, but they have to drink alcohol to stay \u201calive\u201d because it pickles the brain, and, if rigor mortis starts to set in, they have to electroshock their bodies back into action. But since they\u2019re dead, any injuries they get don\u2019t actually heal, so, for example, our protag Braineater Jones here has to remove maggots from his bullet holes each morning, and all the zombies have their own little tips and tricks in order to keep their bodies looking and functioning as alive as possible. Also, their body parts stay alive even when removed, which leads to some extremely interesting scenarios, like Jones having a severed head as a partner in his detective business and a brothel where the men get to choose a head, a torso, and legs separately to form one woman. So what I\u2019m saying is, I absolutely loved the creativity of the zombies and their whole little zombie society. The author really had fun with all the oddities and mishaps that would come with being a walking, talking corpse.The writing was also great in that Braineater Jones had a fantastic voice. I\u2019m no expert on the lingo and culture of the 1930s, but it felt pretty right. It was definitely not just a character from the present plopped into a 1930s setting. The way Jones talked, his thoughts, the slang he used\u2014it really added a lot to the book.The book was also funny in this sarcastic, bizarre, sometimes twisted, sometimes disgusting (literally, because their bodies were rotting corpses) kind of way. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart or the easily offended, but the absurdity of some of the situations combined with Jones\u2019s commentary made for a highly entertaining read.There was also the crime noir/mystery aspect of Jones trying to solve his own murder case, but honestly, I\u2019m not a big crime mystery person. I just liked the book for the fun zombie-ness.So overall, it was a fantastically strange and unique zombie book that was so much fun to read!Recommended For:Anyone who likes humor that's not for the faint of heart and who wants a creative, fun take on zombies that's urban fantasy-esque rather than apocalyptic.\nOriginal Review @ Metaphors and Moonlight"}, {"userName": "A Voracious Reader (a.k.a.

I generally enjoyed this book but it wasn't something I felt the need to devour. It has the added elements of zombies, not a favorite but not something I loathe. This book turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Extremely creative concept, who who would have thought to combine the two genres?Braineater is a very likeable fellow, for a zombie. I really enjoyed his narrative, terrific engaging character. I found myself routing for him all the way. Who can resist a tough guy detective?This book has that AMC feel to it, felt like I was reading a James Cagney movie! I love the whole atmosphere. Not my favorite era, but very entertaining. Definitely not a happy time to be a lady, I probably would have decked somebody! But other than that, and I was warned by the author, all was good.I listened to the audiobook narrated by Steve Rimpici, who really fits the book. He has a great voice for noir, just the right old-timey feel. I loved the pace of the read, it really moved through the whole book, both action and descriptive sections. I would definitely look into more of his reads. I wonder if he has any romances out there? His voice has just enough rasp to make it smexy!The mystery was intriguing, even if it did not go the way I expected. I did not hate the twist, just felt it was a bit left field.

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)Writing a genre thriller is already a risky thing to get right, but doubly so when one attempts to write it in a winking, jokey style; take Steve Kozeniewski's Braineater Jones, for example, which is essentially a zombie story told in the style of a pulpy detective noir, with our Sam Spade stand-in being a freshly reanimated corpse and the book consisting of his hardboiled, wisecracking attempts to figure out what happened to him, which certainly gets a thumbs-up just for ambition. But like I've said here before, hardboiled detective tales are one of the most overused, tired genres for a person to even write in anymore in the 2010s, with zombie stories getting dangerously close to being this way as well; and instead of being a delightful new hybrid of the two like Kozeniewski clearly intended, Braineater Jones is unfortunately a stale hash of the worst of both these genres, with such easily recognizable beats that I could literally guess the next developments in the story in real time as I was reading each chapter. While Kozeniewski should certainly be applauded for putting in the effort, the lackluster results sadly leave a lot to be desired.Out of 10: 7.0"}, {"userName": "Sarah Compton", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30767895-sarah-compton", "userReview": "I received this book for free for an honest review. It's happened before, and usually I dread it because the books are horrible. Luckily, this was far from the case with Braineater Jones.Let's start off by saying this isn't a typical zombie book. The genre has been done to death (pun intended). These zombies talk, feel, have a community, and solve mysteries. This is really very much a private dick/noir story and the detective just happens to be a zombie. It's a fresh take on zombies and is fun even if you aren't into horror.The narrator was perfect for this book. It felt like a noir film for the ears. No one could have done a better job to capture the ambiance of the time the story took place (1935). The reading was nostalgic without feeling gimmicky. I pray for sequels with the same narrator. I know this review doesn't do much in the way or explaining the story, and I apologize.

Not having a clue what happened to him, he realizes that he is in a mansion and does a quick search, finding a few clues to his possible existence. Fleeing from a couple of men who he believes have returned to the scene of their crime, this newly created zombie finds himself in the Welcome Mat part of the town of Ganesh, or The Mat as everyone calls it. It is the hangout of deadheads and deadbeats alike-a place where the trolley cars don\u2019t go and where the police don\u2019t show up when a crime has been committed. With no memory, Braineater stumbles across a few other deadheads who are willing to help him, or at least set him up with alcohol, which is the only thing that keeps the sriffs from becoming true brain eaters. If they pickle their brains in booze, they don\u2019t turn into the monsters we all know and love. With the help of a \u2018sponsor\u2019 who goes by the name of Lazar, the narrator dubs himself Braineater Jones and offers up his services as a Private Investigator. And if he does a few jobs here and there for Lazar, he\u2019ll have enough booze to keep his brain moving and his unlife going forward and at the same time he can try and figure out who the hell he once was, before he was plugged and dumped in the pool. Braineater has plenty of questions, and the fact that his memories aren\u2019t coming back to him like the eventually do with the rest of the undead is pretty suspicious. With the help of a partner who is nothing more than a dead head with no body and despite plenty of other stiffs trying to stop him, including a hot (or rather cold) dame who spells trouble from the get go, he\u2019ll get to the bottom of the mystery, even if he does end up double-dog dead for his troubles.Braineater Jones is a pulpy noir mystery novel set in the back alleys of a strange city a few years prior to World War II, with all the slang and classic detective set ups you could ever want\u2026with the added tidbit that the main character is dead. Braineater is a wise guy through and through, and while many of the other characters are also dead, they could fit perfectly into a classic mold of a Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett hard-boiled novel. This is an interesting cross-genre tale that gives zombies some interesting slants. The author makes the main character as clueless as we are as to why he is up and walking around and makes him explore the reasons for that through his detective work, which allows us to learn as we go. There are hints to voodoo being the culprit, though Braineater\u2019s fixation is on why he has come back and less on why there is a community of the undead as a whole. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep things interesting and a setup for a potential series of books. The zombie purist may not appreciate the liberties the author took with his depiction of the undead, though fans looking for a creative take on the classic zombie setup should appreciate how different the world of Braineater is and how entertaining both he and the rogues gallery of characters are in this story. This was a fun, easy read that made me smile and also had me rooting for a zombie, which isn\u2019t something I do very often."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11198900-linda", "userReview": "This story is narrated by Braineater Jones, we get to see his undead life through his eyes as we join him on his mission to find answers to his growing list of questions. Who is he? Who murdered him and why? Kozeniewski has invented his own brand of zombies in this story. There is no explaining who will reanimate after death and who will not. To keep their undead selves functioning and their \u201cbrain wheels\u201d turning they must have liquor. This is a real problem during Prohibition since without alcohol they will turn into a true brain eating zombie. Jones becomes a private eye of sorts for the undead community as he works his way through mysteries of his own undead life. I enjoyed reading the author\u2019s noir style of storytelling. Here is a sample of Kozeniewski\u2019s writing when a client comes through Jones\u2019s door. It was a dame of course. She had legs up to her eyeballs. Literally. She was carrying a pair of legs, one over each shoulder\u2026 \u201cPawn shop\u2019s downstairs. Not sure if they take drumsticks but never hurts to check.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here for you, Mr. Jones,\u201d she said\u2026 She threw the getaway sticks down on my desk. The toes were clenching, and the feet kept arching and flattening\u2026Her brother was still controlling his legs remotely, kicking to let her know he was still alive. Undead. Whatever. It was a signal, a distress call, an S-O-S by L-E-G. The plot has a good pace and the storylines intertwine into a complex web of deceit, fantastical probabilities, and a touch of sci-fi. The scenes are well depicted and the characters are unique and unlike any I have met before. This was a creative story that will draw you in and keep you guessing. If you like noir detective stories you will likely enjoy this story despite the zombie theme. I found it entertaining and hope Braineater Jones can keep himself from decomposing long enough to make this a long series. FYI: Stephen Kozeniewski places this warning at the beginning of his story. \u201cThis book contains the sort of racist, sexist, and bigoted characters that were commonplace to the era in which it takes place.\u201d It also contains other adult language that may be offensive to some.

The tone, the characters, the dialogue, it all feels so pulpy in its approach, the addition of zombies doesn't seem like so far a stretch.Jones is a zombie, and he's pretty sure that's a recent development despite suffering from amnesia. With foul play involved, he embarks to solve his own murder, taking on a zombified severed head named Alcibe as his sidekick.Alcibe the talking zombie head kind of stole the show in a lot of scenes in which he was featured. From the get-go as he introduced himself to Braineater Jones and demonstrated his tenaciousness to escape his prison of a jar by basically wobbling about on his neck stump, I was pretty much on board with Alcibe. and credit to Steve Rimpici for great voice work, as well. Loved it.Aside from Alcibe, Steve Rimpici's range of voices for this story was fantastic. While Braineater Jones' gruff private-eye voice dominated much of the story, that was fine by me. Maybe you remember Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. That stalky, tough-as-nails, broken-glass-as-chewing-gum kind of voice is, dare I say, trumped by Rimpici's gravelly delivery as Braineater Jones.Overall, the audiobook was a wholly entertaining experience with tremendous voice-acting that lifts up what few shortcomings may come from a story that involves so much genre mashing."}, {"userName": "Ivan Amberlake", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9313724-ivan-amberlake", "userReview": "A guy wakes up floating facedown in a swimming pool with no memory of who he is, where he is, how he died and a number of other questions.

There, now that I've gotten my cheesy one-liner you can put on a cover out of the way, I'll get to the actual review. Braineater Jones is an unconventional Detective story and an unconventional zombie novel in one. Fans coming in expecting your typical shambling undead are going to be disappointed as Stephen Kozeniewski decides to do something different with them. The book's zombies are intelligent, personable, and engaging creatures who just have the problem of being dead. They bear the scars of injuries but rot at an exceptionally slow pace, engaging in many of the past-times they used to while alive (including, yes, THAT). A lot of time is spent describing how the walking dead maintain themselves in this novel. One undead woman maintains her body using plaster and the tools a 1930s mortician might. After so many years of vampirism being treated as a sexy wonderful gift, it was nice to see someone show undeath being disgusting. The book opens with a two page forward by the author pre-apologizing for the fact the book would contain 1930s racism, homophobia, and sexism. This put me on guard and made me wonder if I should continue on but it proved to be an unnecessary warning. Aside from the occasional slur against Italians, the book goes out of its way to underscore how stupid the prejudices of the time were. One black character gets the chance to talk about how irritating it is white people think of him as an easy mark while there's a surprise revelation of a character's bisexuality which I found to be quite bold. Indeed, the zombies of the book serve as an applicable metaphor for the oppressed of the time period. They live in the worst part of Ganesh City, are ignored by municipal services, and are being deliberately targeted by the city officials in hopes they can be run out of town. Even other minorities and oppressed peoples despise the undead. This allows them to serve as a stand-in for any number of groups from blacks to the poor to gays. Tolkien spoke about how The Lord of the Rings was not a metaphor for World War 2 but applicable to discussions of it, which makes it far less likely to go out of style. The zombie situation does not replace the suffering of RL groups but serves as a underscore of them. It's sort of like my opinion of the X-men. They would not be nearly so effective as a weapon against racism if not for our heroes, in addition to being mutants, were a mixture of RL minority groups. None of this would be particularly interesting if the social commentary didn't have a good story attached to it and this book does. Braineater Jones apes a pseudo-Noir style which invokes such films as Sunset Boulevard (our hero wakes up dead in a pool), Sam Spade, Pulp magazines, and a half-dozen other sources. The actual plot is mostly a series of vignettes as Jones deals with one problem after another. He's a private eye of questionable talents but that doesn't stop him from getting into all the troubles one might expect from a zombie in a city of predators. I found the character of Braineater Jones, himself, to be particularly evocative. He has an extremely complex and nuanced character which starts off appearing as an amalgamation of every 1930s P.I. in pop culture but gradually reveals a much-deeper persona. At some points he shows himself capable of great compassion as well as empathy only to revert to astounding ignorance on a dime. His amnesia and discovery of who he once was makes a compelling plot for once as the result may not be what he expects. Does the book have flaws? Yes. One of the twists involving the character of Lazar didn't work for me and the book's later introductions of Pulp's most overused stock villains proves wholly unnecessary. Even if there was a point to their presence, and there is, I would have preferred them to be kept out of the story. Likewise, while I usually applaud character death, a number of enjoyable ones perish before I think the story was \"done\" with them. I also felt the treatment of the Haitians in the book could have been more nuanced as we don't see much of them other than the evil wizard who lives in town. These flaws are not overwhelming ones, however, and are just part of what makes a book distinct. I'd also like to pause and state that I consider the cover of this book to be a triumph of marketing as it immediately made me want to purchase and read the book. It reminded me of Watchmen and that's never a bad thing. In conclusion, Braineater Jones is a great novel. It's probably the most original zombie novel I've read in years and deserves significant kudos. The author should be proud and while I doubt this will become a series, I'd definitely read a sequel.9/10"}], "description": "Braineater Jones wakes up face down in a swimming pool with no memory of his former life, how he died, or why he\u2019s now a zombie.
