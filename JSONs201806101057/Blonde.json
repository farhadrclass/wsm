It must one of the BEST novels of all time. (About this topic I will NEVER kid about...)Seeing the elusive, the ephemeral, through different filters-- a jaguar prowling through the jungle, a baby left all alone, as if you had the privilege to do so in the first place. \"Blonde\" is a privilege to read-- the rarest of rare novel/poetry book combos. Why read itty bitty poetry in its refracted, basically restricted state? Read novels, exemplary novels like this one, for a novel like \"Blonde\" kicks the ass of those tiny singular books... there is poetry in each and every page. Undertaking this journey is a huge endeavor for the reader. This humongous tale for the reader is a grotesque fairy tale through & through.Norma Jean's thoughts/actions occur in present tense, in actual time, & also in fatalistic retrospection. It is a topsy turvy house of horror.This is an expert fictionalization; momentous literature which must be absolutely devoured.The saga is sublime. The topic, the figurehead that is Marilyn Monroe, is and has been ultimately misinterpreted. But thanks to Joyce Carol Oates (give her a Nobel already [I mean, even Coetzee and Saramago have one!]) and her extensive research, the meat on the bones are as beautiful and enigmatic as the person herself (and by this, I mean Monroe AND J.C.O.: their collaboration is what dreams are made of. Their nightmare is our heaven).(Strange to figure how many modern actresses wish to emulate the gorgeous blond, they try time after time, and the great actress tried so much to be the character she was chosen to portray. She was even painfully paranoid of her fictional characterizations drifting into her real life like ghosts!)Consider Oates's Norma Jean as a 20th century Emma Bovary-- but with something to offer the outside world. And of this many great Hollywood men took notice, and the exploitation that ensues is demonic. The elusive father figure-- Norma Jean never met hers, and so what happens is a collection of men she disgustingly refers to as \"Daddy.\" (see? Even porno stars want to be Marilyn!) She becomes addicted to Codeine tablets, super quick solutions to issues which stem all the way from infancy. There is a patina of infinite sadness, of devastation being covered up for the sake of illusion and the glimmering of the silver screen. The novel is filled with endings-- conceivably, almost every section in the story could be a possible way for Oates to finish her masterpiece-- the prolongment is absolutely masochistic and inspiring, if that makes any sense. The novel that starts off with dolls, star homes and star funerals is undoubtedly what awaits the girl (beautiful and young corpse) at the end. Everything: sad, with a foretaste of certain doom, of impending tragedy. The girl devoted to God and literature and meaty roles (as evidenced by her poems and musings which) beg the reader to feel defensive of her, of this child in a woman's body, The Woman's body. The cooly complex metaphysical stuff (this is a 21st century novel after all and all the Greats brought out all their tricks at this point) is infused with intelligence, and, yes, MAGIC. Marilyn is a woman who falls out of time. She recalls scripts that have never even existed before but compete with her actual life-- she's smart beyond recognition, she is not dumb AT ALL. She juxtaposes art with life, and this is what all actresses, all good actresses, must feel for their art. She suffers for her art like any other artist worth his or her salt.It is pretty rare for literature to be so perfectly precise in emulating the theme and source it describes: like the person herself (R.I.P) the novel, for me, will remain unique and unforgettable."}, {"userName": "Bess", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/229445-bess", "userReview": "Finally finished, wish I were still reading, all magic is gone from life now, pls advs.This is the New Feminist Text.

Published in 2000, this is fiction, with characters of the author's invention mingling with real people (some unidentified by name). The word \"epic\" gets thrown about as an adjective far too often, but seems appropriate here in a big, daring book more vivid and harrowing than a biography could be, peeling away the layers around the 20th century's most enigmatic celebrity.In the speculative history Oates plunges the reader into, Norma Jeane's first memory comes at the age of two or three when her mother Gladys Mortensen takes her to Grauman's Chinese Theater. The curious, curly-haired girl begins to frame the events of her life as scenes in a silver screen drama being played out for an audience. By the age of six, in the year 1932, Norma Jeane is living in Los Angeles under the care of her maternal Grandma Della. Her biological father is and always will be unknown, while her mentally unstable mother works for The Studio in a negative-cutting lab. Insisting Norma Jeane call her \"Gladys,\" she changes addresses almost as often as moods. When Grandma Della suffers a stroke, Norma Jeane is placed in the custody of her mother, sharing a bungalow on 828 Highland Avenue. Their closest friends are their neighbors Jess Flynn and Clive Pearce, who work as a film cutter and a musician, respectively. Gladys sees that her shy daughter take piano lessons with Uncle Clive and takes her on tours past the homes of the stars, but suffering paranoid schizophrenia, is a physically and verbally abusive parent. Gladys loses her job and after she sets the bungalow on fire, is interned at the State Hospital in Norwalk. Unable to care for a child full-time, Aunt Jess turns Norma Jeane over to the Los Angeles Orphans Home Society.Who had brought her to this place the child could not recall. There were no distinct faces in her memory, and no names. For many days she was mute. Her throat was raw and parched as if she'd been forced to inhale fire. She could not eat without gagging and often vomiting. She was sickly-looking and sick. She was hoping to die. She was mature enough to articulate that wish: I am so ashamed, nobody wants me, I want to die. She was not mature enough to comprehend the rage of such a wish. Nor the ecstasy of madness of ambition to revenge herself upon the world by conquering it, somehow, anyhow--however any \"world\" is \"conquered\" by any mere individual, and that individual female, parentless, isolated, and seemingly of as much intrinsic worth as a solitary insect amid a teeming mass of insects. Yet I will make you all love me and I will punish myself to spite your love was not then Norma Jeane's threat, for she knew herself, despite the wound in her soul, lucky to have been brought to this place and not scalded to death or burned alive by her raging mother in the bungalow at 828 Highland Avenue.Norma Jeane's charisma attracts couples looking to adopt, but Gladys refuses to sign papers giving up custody. In 1938, Norma Jeane is finally placed in a foster home, with Elsie and Warren Pirig of Van Nuys. As a teenager, Norma Jeane is hard working and obedient, but painfully shy, an adequate student who fails to be chosen for cheerleading or theater arts. Genetic blessings and a gift for ethereal innocence wielded without effort attract the attention of men, including her Uncle Warren. Initially repelled by the prospect of marriage, Norma Jeane bends to Elsie's schemes and weds a good-looking boy from a respectable family named Bucky Glazer. She is sixteen years old.As a wife, Norma Jeane seeks perfection and nothing less, working hard to make sure that all of her husband's needs are met. Initially grateful to have been matched to a wife with movie stars looks, Bucky is nothing but a boy himself, and ultimately bristles at his bride's neediness and creeping insecurity that he too might one day leave her. In 1943, he does just that, enlisting in the Merchant Marines. Heartbroken and refusing the help of her in-laws, Norma Jeane goes to work at Radio Plane Aircraft in Burbank. On the assembly line, she ultimately catches the eye of photographer Otto Ose as he searches for good-looking faces for a piece in Stars and Stripes on girls of the home front.As a model, Norma Jeane has her revenge on those who've rejected her, but has her eyes set on being taken seriously as an actress. She lands an agent, a cunning hunchback named I.A. Shinn who not only envisions big things for Norma Jeane, but is in love with her. Signed to a six-month contract with The Studio after she submits to the sexual gratifications of starmaking executive Mr. Z, Norma Jeane, Shinn and Z arrive on \"Marilyn Monroe\" as her new name. Her contract expires without fanfare and Monroe accepts $50 from Otto Ose to pose nude. With his client at rock bottom, Shinn calls in favors and gets Monroe an audition for a bit part in a movie titled The Asphalt Jungle.The director stares astonished at this platinum blonde lying on the floor at his feet Explaining the character to me! to me, the director! She'd become as unself-conscious as a young willful child. An aggressive child. He forgets to light the Cuban cigar he's unwrapped and stuck between his teeth. There's absolute silence in the rehearsal room as \"Marilyn Monroe\" begins the scene by shutting her eyes, lying motionless in a mimicry of sleep, her breathing deep and slow and rhythmic (and her rib cage and breasts rising, falling, rising, falling), her smooth arms and her legs in nylons outstretched in the abandonment of sleep deep as hypnosis. What are the thoughts men think, gazing down upon the body of a beautiful sleeping girl? Eyes shut, lips just slightly parted. The opening of the scene lasts no more than a few seconds but it seems much longer. And the director is thinking, This girl is the first actress of the twenty or more he's auditioned for the role (including the black haired actress he's probably going to cast) who has caught on to the significance of the scene's opening, the first who seems to have given the role any intelligent thought and who has actually read the entire script (or so she claims) and formed some sort of judgment on it. The girl opens her eyes, sits up slowly and blinking, wide-eyed, and says in a whisper, \"Oh, I--must have been asleep.\" Is she acting, or has she actually been asleep? Everyone's uncomfortable. There is something strange here. The girl with seeming na\u00efvet\u00e9 (or cunning) addresses the director and not the assistant who's reading Louis Calhern's lines, and in this way she makes the director, still with the unlit Cuban cigar clamped between his teeth, her \"uncle\" lover.There were scenes in Blonde so vivid I saw them play out as a long-form television in my mind. Both the tragic glamour of the Marilyn Monroe story and Oates' insightful and electric prose are powerfully compelling. The rooting interest for Norma Jeane to survive the abuses leveled on her by those in power and to take control of her life is strong, even though we know how she ultimately loses her life. Oates justifies her massive page length by exploring how relationships or experiences became the keys Norma Jeane used to unlock her most memorable performances on set. Norma Jeane's approach to her craft is responsible for the enigma of Marilyn Monroe.Widmark was taken by surprise. Never would he know who was \"Marilyn,\" who was \"Nell.\" It wasn't Widmark's style of acting. He was a skilled technical actor. He followed a director's direction. Often his mind was elsewhere. There was something humiliating about being an actor, if you were a man. Any actor is a kind of female. The makeup, the wardrobe fittings. The emphasis on looks, attractiveness. Who the hell cares what a man looks like? What kind of man wears eye makeup, lipstick, rouge? But he'd expected to walk away with the movie. A crappy melodrama that might've been a stage play it was so talky and static, mostly a single set. \"Richard Widmark\" was the sole box-office name in the cast and he took it for granted he'd dominate the movie. Swagger through Don't Bother To Knock as the love interest of two good-looking young women who never meet (The other was Anne Bancroft, in her Hollywood debut.) But every fucking scene with \"Nell\" was a grapple. He'd swear that girl wasn't acting. She was so deep into her movie character you couldn't communicate with her; it was like trying to speak with a sleepwalker. Eyes wide open and seemingly seeing, but she's seeing a dream. Of course, the babysitter Nell was a kind of sleepwalker; the script defined her that way. And, seeing \"Jed Powers,\" she doesn't see him, she sees her dead fianc\u00e9; she's trapped in delusion.Oates demonstrates remarkable agility balancing plates in Blonde. There's Norma Jeane's need for respect as an artist and how this contradicts her need to be cared for. There are the men: her second husband (referred to as The Ex-Athlete) and third husband (who goes as The Playwright), as well as two fictions: the estranged sons of Charlie Chaplin and Edward G. Robinson who Norma Jeane constructs a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with; all of these are nuanced characters attracted to pieces of Norma Jeane and repelled by parts of Marilyn. Though mingling of fact and fiction, we're shown how an often sick industry can damage and destroy unstable people, and whether immortality on film is worth that sacrifice."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "This book was marvellous in many ways! It's a fictional piece of work following the life of Norma Jeane Baker, aka. Marilyn Monroe, from she's a child till her death as a 36-year-old woman devoured and intoxicated with drugs, medication and alcohol. It's a tragic life story, but it's hugely inspiring as well, and if you have even the faintest interest in Marilyn Monroe's life I would highly recommend this book. To me, one of the most interesting aspects of \"Blonde\" was how it balances fiction and facts. It's based on the truth, but it's retold through another person who, I assume, hasn't ever met Monroe and only know her through the media coverage that we all have access to. This book reads like great fiction, but simultaneously I learned so much about Monroe's fascinating life and development into the sexy icon she became. I LOVED THIS! I have never read anything like this, and I know that this book has impacted me hugely. I will remember and cherish it for a long time to come because it speaks of a life so beloved, intriguing, tragic and yet fascinating, and it does so wonderfully. What a piece of art \"Blonde\" is!"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie", "userReview": "I have conflicting emotions about this book, and it goes something like this, \u201cThe book is about Marilyn, so what is there NOT to like about it, right? Warts and all, it is a powerful book written by a powerful writer.\u201d But the song that keeps playing in my head, the words that keep haunting me, comes from the voice of another writer, This is the story of a rape.\u201cThis is the story of a rape, of the events that led up to it and followed it and of the place in which it happened. There are the action, the people and the place; all of which are interrelated but in their totality incommunicable in isolation from the moral continuum of human affairs.\u201dThere is something so ugly and disturbing about Joyce Carol Oates\u2019s interpretation of Marilyn\u2019s life that if one were to take away the author\u2019s name, one would suspect it was written by a loathsome mysogynist, hell-bent on destroying every last vestige of humanity in Marilyn Monroe, movie-queen, and Norma Jeane Baker, innocent dreamer.I fell into a trance in the first few hundred pages, falling subject to Norma Jeane\u2019s unquenchable spirit. Even tossed about by the vagaries of her early years, the reader sees how Norma Jeane was destined for some kind of greatness. She was an indefatigable optimist; a resilient life force that did battle with her mother\u2019s depression and burgeoning insanity, and from under which she sprang out stronger still. It was only later, after the little fighter had grown into a vibrant woman who had been knocked down one too many times that the inherited depression finally consumed her and dragged her into hell. In the intervening years she fought -- and fought like hell -- to hang onto the dream of \u201cgetting out alive\u201d and making something of her life. The reader can\u2019t help but feel an overwhelming sadness, and fatalism, because unlike the young Norma Jeane, we know how the story ends. So far, so good, despite its all-consuming sadness.Then, Oates\u2019s fangs come out. She reveals to us her secret loathing for Marilyn, sub-consciously played out in the voice of the men who hated The Blonde Actress: cow, cunt, stupid cunt, mammalian bitch, tramp, slut, WHORE, sucker of cocks, depressed whacko bitch, stupid cunt, stupid cunt, stupid cunt. OK, we hear you. But that\u2019s the point: I don\u2019t hear the voice of the men so much as I hear Oates\u2019s voice in my head: you whore, you bitch, you cunt. The sub-text screams to me so loudly, it\u2019s like a punch in the face by Oates, every slander uttered. This is nothing but a vile peep show, it occurred to me half way through the novel. Here I am, engaging in the tearing down of the movie-queen, complicit in the act of rape. No one is forcing me to read this book, just like no one forced Oates to write it.The voyeuristic quality is enhanced by the protracted use of the third person: The Blonde Actress, The Ex-Athlete, The Playwright, The President. We, the readers, are standing in the red light district, leering into the dimly-lit and dirty window where the young woman lies exposed and vulnerable. No one looks away, either out of decency or revulsion. A human being is being torn apart, and we continue to be complicit in her excoriation.You won\u2019t write about me, will you, Daddy? You won\u2019t write about me, will you? You won\u2019t write about me? Knowing this -- knowing how much Norma Jeane abhorred being written about in her Marilyn persona -- Oates revels in ignoring her plea. Like the paparazzi who swoop like carrion birds, she licks up every last intimate detail and splatters it luridly for our consumption. Disturbingly, Oates seems even more obsessed with Marilyn\u2019s body than the raving fans: dwelling, obsessively, on skin and excretions and secretions, ad nauseam. She is pre-occupied with Marilyn\u2019s sexual intimacies and her miscarriages and her womb. She is so consumed by Marilyn\u2019s womb, in fact, that she leaves us with the notion she believes all Marilyn ever was, was a big gaping receptacle of vileness, hungry for as much degradation as she could possibly contain. Over and over again, we hear stupid cunt, hailed as the avenue to the stinking, infertile receptacle. Marilyn\u2019s womb did not bear fruit, after all -- it was simply another secreting, foul failure of our movie-queen.\u201cI\u2019m always running into people\u2019s unconscious.\u201d Those words, prophetically spoken by Marilyn Monroe in her empty-headed persona, shine quite a light on this fictional biography. Oates seems to have run smack into the middle of her own \u201cunconscious\u201d while trying to explore Marilyn\u2019s. As much as art can be an exploratory medium to expose the vileness of the world and act as a cathartic force for change, just as often it reveals the vileness or the victim within. It often uncovers our own hidden truths and reveals to us our own failings. When confronted with ourselves, it thus becomes easy to say \u201cthis is just art\u201d when we really should be admitting \u201cthis is me.\u201d As much as this was an authoritative book then, it was an equally forceful indictment of the things that should not be said. Certain secrets should not be violated. Add to that, there are some books that should never have been written, despite the truths they hold. This is one of them.So many will disagree -- because it was written by an influential writer, and it\u2019s art."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "I wasn't really sure how to go about reviewing this book at first, but then I came up with a solution, and it's a reviewing style I'll call The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.Here we go.The Good: Of course, Joyce Carol Oates is a scary-talented author and I bow at her feet. The writing in this book goes from staggeringly beautiful to heart-wrenchingly sad, and all of it is masterfully executed. The fact is, no matter what the following might say, I would probably give my left foot to be able to write like Oates does. So let's move on.The Bad: The story, a fictionalized account of Marilyn Monroe's life, is yet another thrilling installment in this author's Men Are Evil And Will Hurt You saga. Okay Joyce, I get that Marilyn had issues. I get that men pushed her around. But honestly:\"Then came her fairy godmother to tell her: There's a secret way into the Walled Garden!There's a hidden door in the wall, but you must wait like a good little girl for this door to be opened....You must win over the doorkeeper - an old, ugly, green-skinned gnome. You must make the doorkeeper take notice of you. You must make the doorkeeper desire you. And then he will love you and will do your bidding! Smile! Smile, and be happy! Smile, and take off your clothes! For your Magic Friend in the mirror will help you....the old, ugly green-skinned gnome was really a prince under an evil enchantment, and he will kneel before you and ask for your hand in marriage, and you will live with him happily forever in his Garden kingdom; never will you be a lonely, unhappy little girl again. So long as you remain with your Prince in the Walled Garden.\"Good lord. And I haven't even mentioned how she calls each of her husbands \"Daddy\". Really, Joyce: you can cut the subtlety with a freaking battle axe here. The Ugly: Several of Marilyn Monroe's movies are described in the book, including Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Some Like It Hot. These are two of my favorite movies - or I should say, they used to be. I'm not sure, because I haven't tried watching them, but they might be ruined for me. Can we talk about Some Like It Hot for a minute here? Oates's book tries to make the case that by this point in Marilyn Monroe's career everyone was disgusted with her, and her love interest in the movie, \"C\" (aka Tony Curtis) was so grossed out by her that he hating acting in the romantic scenes with her. Okay. Tony Curtis's autobiography, American Prince: A Memoir, recently came out, and I read an excerpt in Vanity Fair. He was writing about Marilyn and how they used to date before she was famous and had red hair (two things that aren't in the book - HA! Joyce Carol Oates, I know something you don't know!). Anyway, they weren't going out when they made the movie, but he was still attracted to her. According to Curtis, he totally had a hard-on for that entire scene in the yacht, and Marilyn knew it. What's Oates's take on the movie? Here you go: \"And so C despised her & at their climactic kissing scene how he'd wish to spit into Sugar Kane's phony ingenue face for by this time the mere touch of Monroe's leathery skin revulsed him & C would be Monroe's enemy for life & after her death what tales C would tell of her!\"I really, really hope that Tony Curtis reads Blonde. And I hope he sends Joyce Carol Oates a letter that goes like this: \"Dear Ms. Oates - Rot in hell, you pretentious feminazi asshole. What gives you the right to write down Marilyn's life for her and assign roles to each of us so we could all look like evil bastards compared to her? You didn't know her, you didn't know any of us, and you're no better than all the tabloids, exploiting her fame and her death to make money.

Not because of the writing, which is phenomenal, but because we already know the sad ending. Joyce Carol Oates takes us on a literary journey from babyhood through to the end with a flawless, relentless depiction of the mind within the body that embarked on this particular journey. It is beyond sad to bear witness to the reactions and defenses of a mind molded by fear, uncertainty, unpredictability and unreliability that resulted in a young woman who became her own worst enemy and basically orchestrated her own downfall. With her background, falling prey to the Hollywood system of male dominance of the time seemed inevitable. The failure of The Blonde\u2019s various coping mechanisms was not surprising, nor was it surprising that this also sabotaged her personal relationships resulting in yet more reinforcement for self-sabotage. A downward-directed spiral, indeed. Lamentable as the story is, I would recommend this book to any reader who is interested in the psychology of mind that can propel a soul through life from innocence to a tragic end."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates has appropriated our American wet dream, the winner of the global boner bracket, the all-time \"Who'd You Rather?\" champion, she's taken and made some kind of Cinderella Christ myth out of her, tarted up for the ball by her leering old fairy godfather and when the clock hits twelve martyred for our filthy sins. No soft-focus angel Christ here, either: this is Mel Gibson torture Christ, all meat and oozing sores inside her mouth. Oates insists on the fact of her body: Marilyn Monroe spends the entire book menstruating and sweating and stinking and pissing. When she's sodomized by an old guy Oates describes it, \"like a beak plunging in.\" She never blinks. She feels everything. Like Christ, she has some Daddy issues. Like Christ, she tries to chicken out. Like Christ she seems to understand where this is all headed, and to face it bewildered and terrified. She's not dumb, she just has no defenses. She knows why she's here. \"It was my intention to create a female portrait as emblematic of her time and place as Emma Bovary was of hers,\" says Oates, and you're like, \"Create? Wasn't Marilyn Monroe already created?\" But the historical Monroe is a palimpsest for Oates. She has her own agenda. \"The historical individuals are not in the novel,\" she says: \"Rather, their historical roles are the subject of the novel.\" In one scene Marilyn Monroe goes incognito to the theater to watch her own movie and finds herself surrounded by men staring up at the screen and masturbating, and that scene is this book in a nutshell.Oates has her sights set high. Blonde is her longest book and her most audacious in a long career of audacity, and it totally works. (Suck it, Mailer.)

It wasn't until I got it home that I noticed the cover was a silhouette of Marilyn Monroe with her back to the camera. This book kept me up til the wee hours for the seven days it took me to finish it. It is a fictionalized biography in that it recalls the life of Marilyn from birth to \"mysterious\" death at age 37 (?) from an overdose of sleeping pills with conversations and situations imagined as they might have been. I learned so much about her childhood (she never knew her father; her mother was institutionalized; she spent years in orphanages and foster homes; married by age 16) as well as about how she was discovered, and how she made it in Hollywood. The book is a portrait of a victim exploited by producers (she would make millions for the studios and they would pay her minimum wages...she ultimately died with very little) as well as by the media, the people who claimed to love her, even the president (JFK). In one word this book was FASCINATING in the way that looking at photos of celebrities in People magazine is so addictive. After reading this, I rushed out and rented Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire just to see for myself how the camera loved Marilyn.

I would recommend to anyone with an appetite for long and literary books. It is typically darker than perhaps reality, given JCO's penchant for the dark side of things. So take that as a warning, Marilyn fans: this is her life through a glass darkly to be sure. After hearing some of the more recent accusations/accounts about JFK, it makes one lean toward JCO's dark lens on that particular relation. (Pages have come forward that they were made to service him, and there are accounts that he cheated on Jackie on thier honeymoon - so much for Camelot. Sounds like he was a nightmare not to be believed toward women).Agree with others that this shines a light on troubles of women for a generation and beyond...and also agree with others that you must remember this is fiction - well -researched, but fiction nonetheless.I feel like JCO tapped into a lot of uncanny truth here, though.

It appears to have pissed off many Monroe as well as Oates fans. Many who claim writer Oates was just bitter and jealous of Monroe's beauty, one reviewer going so far, after seeing Oates picture on the back cover, to say it was because \"she'd been beaten with the ugly stick herself\". Sheesh, talk about ugly people!I enjoyed the book even though it was pretty bleak and mostly depressing but how could it be otherwise? Monroe's life wasn't exactly the happily ever fantasy what with her rough beginning, the abuse, the sex and the drugs. I thought Oates did an enviable job of recreating Monroe's voice, her motivation and getting to the heart of the woman behind the myth. It begins with Monroe as a young child and portrays the abuse she suffers at the hands of an unstable mother and sets the ground work for Marilyn's unsuccessful search for a normal life which clashes time and time again with her overwhelming drive to become a successful and important actress."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102271-cynthia", "userReview": "Fictional account of Marilyn Monroe.

However, there were some things I didn't like.One thing I didn't like was that JCO did not stay true to the facts regarding MM and Joe Dimaggio's relationship after their split. Actually JD and MM remained friends after their divorce and JD made MM's funeral arrangements and tried to help MM with her dependency problems later in life. In the book, MM fled from JD after a brutal beating, divorced him, and never spoke with him again. Obviously, this book is a novel, and the conversations between the (real) characters and such is just JCO's imagination, she can't have really known what they said, but I really would have liked her to stick to the facts that are known. Another thing I didn't like is sometimes I feel JCO just went over the top with some of MM's borderline hallucinations. Some of it was just too abstract and unbelievable for me. JCO did such a wonderful job displaying the conflicts in MM's personality/person. Just amazing. I'm in awe. I have to say one other thing. Several of the reviews about this book talk constantly about how MM was victimized and the book has a feminist theme. I don't think so. Certainly MM was badly used and taken advantage of early in her life. But as she gained a lot of fame and box office appeal, she gained bargaining power with the Studio and others in her life. But she continued to let herself be used. I have a lot of sympathy for MM, she had an absolutely horrible childhood. But at some point in our life we all have to try to learn from our mistakes and not repeat them. MM didn't. Unfortunately MM had a very destructive streak and developed a hard core drug/alcohol problem later in life. And she treated her third husband, Arthur Miller, like SHIT later in their marriage; when he loved her and was kind to her and was concerned about her. It was then much harder for me to feel sorry for MM when JFK used her like a hooker - after she had just openly cheated on AM and cursed at him when he tried to help her when he thought she was going to overdose on RX/booze - clearly hurting him. At that point in her life she had made her choice to ingest massive amounts of drugs and alcohol every day and let men use her. In sum, a very interesting, well-written period piece - I will never look at MM the same way again."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5013497-mark", "userReview": "\u201cIn life, the woman was hell and in hell; on film, divine.\u201d-Billy Wilder\u201cBeauty is a question of optics.

I chose to read \"Blonde\" to find out more about Marilyn Monroe, to learn some of the truth behind the icon, so that she would become more real to me and less abstract. Ironically, I think this is the opposite of what Oates had in mind for readers when writing her book, as she has described Marilyn Monroe as a universal figure and, advancing this idea, presents \"Blonde\" as an updated Cinderella fairy tale using a series of abstract figures, starring Monroe as the \"Fair Princess,\" a number of men as the \"Dark Prince,\" and Monroe\u2019s two husbands as the \"Ex-athlete\" and the \"Playwright.\" However, while Oates tries to emphasize the universal elements of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s fairytale rise to fame, ultimately she undermines the myth as she details Marilyn Monroe\u2019s inner thoughts and concerns, making her appear less like a universal figure and more like a real, and unique, person.In \"Blonde,\" Oates initially focuses on the Cinderella-type fairy tale rise of Marilyn Monroe from obscurity and neglect to worldwide fame and adulation. Marilyn Monroe is born Norma Jeane Baker. She doesn\u2019t know who her father is, and her mother is emotionally unbalanced and tries to kill her, ultimately being sent to a mental facility and leaving Norma Jeane as an orphan. But in a fairy tale, \"always there was the Fair Princess. And always the Dark Prince.\" The Dark Prince arrives in the form of Otto Ose, who swoops into Norma Jean\u2019s life to save her from her boring job. He takes her pictures and sells her image, allowing her to be discovered by the Studio. Oates recasts Norma Jeane\u2019s story as a fairy tale: \"Once upon a time,\" she says, there was a little girl who came to the Walled Garden and discovered the secret way in from her fairy godmother. \"There\u2019s a hidden door in the wall, but you must wait like a good little girl for this door to be opened,\" she tells her. \"You must win over the doorkeeper \u2013 an old, ugly, green-skinned gnome. You must make the doorkeeper take notice of you. You must make the doorkeeper admire you. You must make the doorkeeper desire you.\" Only then, would the ugly gnome fall in love with her and the two \"live happily forever in his Garden Kingdom.\" As Otto offers Norma Jeane $50 to pose nude, she thinks, \"I saw that I must be sold. For there I would be desired, and I would be loved.\" Norma Jeane sells herself and is transformed into the \"Fair Princess,\" Marilyn Monroe, who is loved and desired by many men.However, Oates does not end her story with this transformation of Norma Jeane into Marilyn Monroe, as the last part of the book details the inner life of Marilyn Monroe. Although Norma Jeane could be seen as a universal figure \u2013 a poor orphan who struggles for fame by selling herself \u2013 Marilyn Monroe herself is a unique figure and icon. While Oates tries to maintain the fairy tale elements of the story by giving Monroe\u2019s famous husbands and lovers mythic qualities by referring to them only as the \"Ex-athlete,\" the \"Playwright,\" and the \"President,\" these are not clearly not abstract figures. Whether they are named or not, they are clearly Joe Dimaggio, Arthur Miller, and John F. Kennedy. Furthermore, Oates doesn\u2019t even attempt to make Marilyn Monroe\u2019s movies abstract events, as she refers to specific movies like \"The Asphalt Jungle,\" \"Niagara,\" and \"Some Like It Hot,\" and describes Marilyn Monroe\u2019s specific roles in those movies as \"Angela,\" \"Rose,\" and \"Sugar Kane.\" These are not Cinderella roles the reader is going to project herself into; these are Marilyn Monroe\u2019s roles. As readers, we gain even more insight into the life of Marilyn Monroe as Oates details her inner life, making Marilyn Monroe less abstract and more like a real person. For example, as she watches the happy ending of her character Cherie in Bus Stop, she starts crying: \"Why was I crying? Maybe because in actual life Cherie would\u2019ve been drinking a lot. She would\u2019ve been missing half her teeth. She would\u2019ve had to sleep with the bastards. . . . There wouldn\u2019t have been any good-looking yokel-cowboy Bo to throw her over his shoulder and carry her away to his ten-thousand-acre ranch.\" In exposing us to the real life of Marilyn Monroe, the fairy tale is lost, as we see all the gory details of her destruction. She is not some abstract Cinderella, but rather a real person with her own doubts and anxieties. As the last part of the book details Marilyn Monroe\u2019s inner life, \"Blonde\" loses its mythic qualities, as the real-life Marilyn Monroe replaces the universal Cinderella-type figure of Norma Jeane.While Oates tries to emphasize the universal elements of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s fairytale rise to fame, ultimately she undermines the fairy tale as she details Marilyn Monroe\u2019s inner thoughts and concerns, making her appear less universal and more like a real, and unique, person. Reinforcing this idea, Oates ends \"Blonde\" with a poem titled, \"The Fairy Tale \u2013 THE BURNING PRINCESS,\" which clearly relates to the life of Marilyn Monroe. In this poem, Oates describes a Beggar Maid transformed into a Fair Princess by the Dark Prince as he gives her a \"magic elixir,\" cleansing her body and bleaching her hair before setting it on fire. The Princess dives off the platform, leaving her burning body and the maddening screams of the crowd behind. Oates writes, \"[T]he burning Princess was dead. & I [the Beggar Maid] was alive.\" But is this true? Does The Beggar Maid (Norma Jeane) endure, while the Princess (Marilyn Monroe) dies? The answer is no \u2013 clearly, it is the icon of Marilyn Monroe that endures. While Oates\u2019 goal behind \"Blonde\" is to teach us all a universal truth, in reality we learn more about the life of Marilyn Monroe than we learn about ourselves. Although \"Blonde\" has piqued my curiosity about her life, and maybe I will watch one of her movies now, I am still not sure what the lesson of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s life is for the rest of us."}, {"userName": "Roman Clodia", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia", "userReview": "A huge book as JCO gives us a fictional re-imagining of Norma Jeane (sic) from her early childhood with a dangerous, mentally-unstable mother, via an orphanage, a foster home and, eventually, Hollywood - via numerous detours. JCO is especially interested in Norma Jeane's inner life and her relationships with men, all driven by her search for her absent father. I know little about Monroe so have no idea what is fact and what fiction but certainly this feels like a convincing portrait of a woman created and constructed as 'Marilyn Monroe'. Certainly the persona made millions for the studios (while Norma Jeane was paid a pittance) but it also served Norma Jeane herself, allowing her, to some extent, to keep her true self hidden - although, eventually, of course, it becomes erased...JCO makes much of 'Marilyn's' body: flaunted, sewed into straitjacket-tight dresses, always on show, and contrasts it with the more troublesome flesh of Norma Jeane: her heavy periods, her anxious sweats, her miscarriages. The idea of Gemini, The Twins, appears and reappears, too, from Norma Jeane's Mirror Self, to the literal number of characters born under the star sign.Inflected by concerns with feminism, with gaze theory, this is an uncompromisingly modern take on a sad, sad story. There are points where this made me think about Sylvia Plath, another American young woman caught up in the social constrictions of what a woman is supposed to be.It would have been easy for JCO to merely give us a sad, almost pathetic tale of exploitation, loneliness and abuse, but actually she does something far cleverer and more discomforting that that: for we, too, are implicated in the creation and sustaining of 'Marilyn': every time we watch her perform, every time we swoon over her beauty, we look at her with the same possessive, externalised, powerful gaze which makes her no more than an object to be viewed. An intelligent analysis of a modern cultural icon, and a book which gives back attention to the woman behind the Monroe mask."}, {"userName": "Dayla", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10800635-dayla", "userReview": "This is my first Joyce Carol Oats' book, and I was totally blown away by Oats' brilliance at creating scenes--one you can smell, feel and taste. For example, Gladys' smell in the Lakewood rest home; or Marilyn's smell after sex with a president. They all seemed pitch perfect. What also allowed such full descriptions and insight was the author's statement in the preface that none of the book is true. So, while the author didn't know if MM might have an oily filmy sweat problem as a result of mixing Nembutal and Codeine, Oats' research about the side effects of such a mix cannot be disputed. MM had a multitude of battles she was fighting simultaneously, needing to be re-powdered for the cameras due to the oily filmy sweat being just one. This is the small moment that Oats so ably captures--a moment that makes a reader feel like NOW they know MM. What I also enjoyed was the added insight she provided into the JoeD husband. What his hands looked like (massive). What someone that talented has learned just through simple observation of emotions on/off the baseball field far outweighed someone's desire to obfuscate. MM was a practiced actress who cried easily and had successfully manipulated the opposite sex. But to JoeD's learned observer's eye, she had met her match. Finally, Oats captures the essence of what happens to the human brain under attack--what little tricks one uses to shore up any gaps that might indicate to the world a severe break in mental health. Yet, all the same, without a map, without a compass, and given only a few crumbs to start, one has to admire a woman who managed to successfully negotiate and chart not only a survivor's life, but a world-famous, glamorous-looking life that will not be forgotten anytime soon.

Joyce Carol Oates has emphasized that it is a fictional novel, based on true events. She added an e to Norma Jean to clarify that it is fiction based on Norma Jean or a description of how Norma Jean might have thought and felt during her life.Norma Jeane had a tragic childhood. Her mother was an addict and schizofrenic, and mistreated Norma, even tried to kill her. Norma\u2019s father was unknown. She hadn\u2019t much experience of being loved, at least not in a normal way. When she was discovered by a photographer at work, she must have felt accepted and appreciated, and that was the beginning of her carrier.I didn\u2019t know much about her, apart from her being a glamour model and having been in some movies. All her life, she tried to be an actress. She read the big authors and wanted to be taken seriously. That was her dream, but the powerful people of Hollywood had other plans. She gave them what they wanted, to be acknowledged. She didn\u2019t want to be like her mother. She was obsessed with keeping herself clean and neat, and nude pictures felt dirty. Why did she do it? When to cross the line? When do one have to sell oneself? She accepted to be a sex symbol and laughed at because, at least, it meant that she was somebody. That, and the fact that she needed money.She only earned fifty dollars from the nude pictures that would become historic. Her financial situation and her loneliness made her finally pass the line. She earned fifty dollars on the pictures, the men would use the them without her approval and earn millions of dollars. The fear that people would photograph her and use the pictures without her permisson would haunt her for the rest of her life.She was a machine, made by men, for men. She existed for someone else. Her body was dressed and decorated for someone else. This is very interesting. Even though she is the biggest sex symbol of her time, perhaps even in history, she didn\u2019t have access to her own sexuality. Joyce Carol Oates didn\u2019t write about this, but according to some people there are sound recordings of Norma talking to her psychiatrist about never having had an orgasm. She must have felt extinguished because of her limited, narrow role, that prevented her from getting the movie parts that she deserved, and not being taken seriously when trying to discuss everything from psychological aspects of her characters to literature.She was being used, exploited and punished because she was naive and too kind. Then, she was punished again, when agreeing to become Marilyn. She was being laughed at and treated like merchandise. Whatever she did, she couldn\u2019t win. The only way she was able to be an actress was on the terms of the powerful men of Hollywood. Why could she not be both the shy Norma Jeane and the sensual Marilyn Monroe? Perhaps it is not possible. Perhaps being Marilyn changed Norma Jeane. Many people thought she was a talented actress, others that she did not act at all. Perhaps she recognized herself in her characters and was able to understand them. She seems to have used her own experience to become a character. Perhaps, all characters were in her. She acted with such passion and gave life to the characters, which seemed inadequate and not developed enough. She had to make them human. She gave such a performance and needed a challenge, she needed to play believable women, not stereotypes.The expectations of Marilyn Monroe exceeded the cameras and spotlight. The role of Marilyn Monroe continued after the lights went out. Everyone wanted Marilyn Monroe. Nobody wanted a boring woman with a tragic past. (She began to change her story. At one point, she stated that it was her friend who was nearly drowned by her mother, not her.) It must have been difficult to know who she really was. As Marilyn Monroe she was noticed, appreciated, disrespected and despised. Norma Jeane seemed no longer to exist. She played Marilyn who played the role in a movie. It must have been confusing to do a love scene with an actor who played that he was in love with her character, but in reality despised Marilyn and had no idea who Norma Jeane was. (In the book, both O, Laurence Olivier, and C, Tony Curtis, despised her and, if that is true, it must have been difficult to play against them.) Everyone thought Norma Jeane was Marilyn. Sometimes she talked about Marilyn Monroe like a totally different person, it must have been a horrible identity crisis. Her entire life, she was alone and misunderstood, despite having husbands and many fans. Much of her time was spent trying to reunite with her mother and thinking about her father. The lack of love had a major impact on her, and she remained a lost woman who sought confirmation in the only way that was possible for her. Her appearance. In that way, she met Charles Chaplin Junior, Marlon Brando, Arthur Miller and even President Kennedy.Women liked her, perhaps because they recognized themselves in her. I know Marilyn. She is in me and many women. I recognize myself in her as many women no doubt do. We are her and she is us. Perhaps because women know how it feels to be objectified. Norma Jeane was an object. She always regarded herself from the outside, from the male gaze. Her life was like scenes in a single, long movie, where she would try to be liked by other people. Somehow she forgot that she existed in real life. (She was hanging out of a helicopter in South Korea in a military area because it would be a fantastic scene, despite not filming a movie at the time.) She knew she had to be admired by men because men held the power in Hollywood. Of course, she could have chosen another work, in the outskirts of Los Angeles, or she could have moved to a place with lower rent, but she wanted to be an actress. Perhaps the city and the movie industry reminded her of her mother and made her feel secure. She was shy and reserved, but she could hide behind Marilyn. Marilyn was a robot that was constructed several hours before recording a scen.An interesting part of the book was Joyce Carol Oates thoughts about fame. According to Marx, religion is the opium of the people. Now, religion had been replaced by fame, even though the church of fame did not promise salvation and heaven. The tempel of fame is a hall with mirrors of laughter. This feels relevant and of current interest. Today, everyone wants to be famous, regardless of how.The book is nuanced, with subtle sentences and contrasts. Joyce Carol Oates returns several times to the difference between stage and reality. The reality resembles the scene, but details which means much during a scene, such as when studying someone from the corner of one\u2019s eyes, or a long silence, might mean much during a scene, but in reality there is no music that reveals the mood and significance.It is a tremendous novel. The author has used a conspiracy for effect, but that isn\u2019t necessary. The book is very interesting anyway. It is very long and takes time to read, but it is very well written. She brakes many rules and has her own way of writing. If you are not familiar with Norma Jeane's life, it's impossible to know which elements are true and which are fiction, which bothers me. I try to view the book as fiction, but, of course, I always think of the real Norma Jean Baker.However, the book deals with more than the mysterious Norma Jean Baker. It gives an insight into what it was like to be a woman in the 40's and 50\u2019s in Los Angeles. When reading about people\u2019s reading habits, I notice that women tend to be interested in this kind of literature, while men tend to avoid it. According to some literature professors women generally read books about and written by men and women. Men generally read books about and written by men. It's a shame because this epic novel is interesting, regardless of gender.The book describes the American community after World War II and the hunt for communists. It portrays the role women had to play. It tells the story of the movie industry in the 40s and 50s and the search for identity by acting. It can be viewed as a general story of the woman's role in society, and a specific story about a lonely, powerless, despised person\u2019s struggle against the world."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3223068-catherine", "userReview": "Blonde provides a masterful, disturbing and perceptive characterization of Marilyn Monroe that coincides with all of the other information I have read about her but provides additional interpretation into her psyche through the guise of fiction. The book itself is impossible to describe as it takes on a stylistic form that is very specific and complex. This is not just someone randomly writing a fictional biography of Monroe. This is Joyce Carol Oates, one of the most prolific and important authors of our time. She paints Monroe as someone who is basically doomed from the start as her early experiences shaped her character which together forms a self-destructive soul. Oates\u2019 Monroe is overly eager to please. She just wants to be accepted and loved. She wants desperately to be considered a serious actress. She is looked at as a whore by all which is not helped with her sleeping with everyone. Nobody can look past her body and her beauty. She is constantly \u201cplaying\u201d Marilyn. She is far too trustworthy. She is far too easily influenced by others. Everybody uses her and she willfully lets herself be used. She is plagued with an intense and lifelong debilitating stage-fright. Her childhood included an absent father which she turned into mythic proportions at a young age, a very troubled mother who possibly tried to killer her, sexual abuse at foster homes and being married off at a very young age to someone equally incapable of handling marriage are just some of her early experiences which shape her. All of these events are true and Oates did not make any of this up. Monroe comes off as certainly smarter than people thought she was but in many ways she is frustratingly na\u00efve, child-like, dependent and needy. The main juxtaposition that Oates points out continuously is that Monroe\u2019s life was full of adult situations that were very serious and intense but she herself never really grew up and remained very much like a child. This is an assertion I have read confirmed by many who interacted with her. The way Oates writes is, as I said, very complex. A lot of the book is surreal with the later sections feeling like we are reading it under a layer of haze. Random thoughts from others are sprinkled out and italicized throughout the book. It switches perspectives suddenly between different characters but also between different selves of Monroe. The book refers to her at times as Norma, others as Marilyn, others as The Blonde Actress and others as the various parts she played. Oates also refers to her many times in the way other men see her. This leads to a lot of the description of her to be very uncomfortable and degrading but also effective. The men she gets involved with mostly have abstract titles such as \u201cThe Ex-Athlete\u201d and \u201cThe Playwright\u201d. She repeatedly revisits events and thoughts of Monroe\u2019s and in later parts of the book brings back characters and events in a muddled and ambiguous way. What did I think of the book? Well, technically, it is astounding. Oates really gets inside of her head. Even though I was aware throughout reading it that this was a fictional interpretation of Monroe\u2019s life, it was very difficult to separate that fact with the seeming accuracy and complex perception she has of Monroe. While she twists things around in terms of events and the other perspectives, her characterization of Monroe seems disturbingly and frighteningly true which makes the tragic nature of her life and the book come through well. There were certain aspects of the book that were particularly interesting. The sections with her mother Gladys were a highlight since Gladys was one hell of a character herself. My favorite chapters were the ones titled \u201cAngela 1950\u201d, \u201cNell 1952\u201d, \u201cRose 1953\u201d, \u201cCherie 1956\u201d, \u201cSugar Kane 1959\u201d and \u201cRoslyn 1962\u201d. These chapters describe experiences on the sets of these films, the way she felt about these characters and the way she personalized them by infusing her own life into them. These were very rewarding to read on multiple levels.Overall though I was not crazy about the book; it was certainly an interesting read but along with its superbly written prose and great characterization comes some problems. First of all this book is far too long (730 pages in small font) and about half way through becomes repetitive and eventually offers little that feels rewarding or worth the trouble. Oates revisits things too often and she ends up hitting us over the head with the majority of what she is trying to do making it almost impossible to appreciate it at a certain point. This book could have been shortened by 200 pages and still have said everything she wanted to. She also changes neglects certain events which, when considering its length, becomes frustrating. In particular I am thinking about her time living with Milton Greene and his wife, her affair with Yves Montand and DiMaggio\u2019s re-entrance in her life right at the end. It also neglects to tell us of any of her time with her many psychiatrists or the overpowering influence her acting coaches had over her as she not only depended on men but on these coaches to tell her when she got a take right. The last section of the book entirely disconnected me as a reader. The story becomes too hazy and does not offer anything additional about her final months. I also hated the way her relationship with JFK is portrayed as it is so far-fetched and over-the-top to be taken with any seriousness. It also portrays her death as murder on the orders of JFK which is a theory I have never believed for a second. The book has certainly inspired me to pick up an actual biography of Monroe. There are so many but two of them are considered to be the best. I am probably going to go for Donald Spato\u2019s biography as it not only is considered the best but it also interprets her death the way I believe it to be whereas Anthony Summers\u2019 bio goes the JFK route."}, {"userName": "Moushine Zahr", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53509133-moushine-zahr", "userReview": "This was the last book I've started reading in 2016 and the first book I finished reading in 2017 and WHAT A NOVEL!!! This novel is a fiction story relating a fictive version of the life of Norma Jeane alias Marilyn Monroe. Some of the book's contents are true based on or inspired by her real life while other stories are pure fiction. This is the story of a lonely woman, with little basic school education, no family and no friends, trying to live, work and survive in the cruel male dominated world of Hollywood who treated her like a meat merchandise. She was treated by all only as a sex symbol while she really wanted and needed only to be loved, to love, and to be respected. In this novel, the author, Joyce Coral Oastes, dissects under a microscopic lense the entire life of Norma Jeane from birth til death and of Marilyn Monroe from creation til destruction. Through these two lives lived by the same woman, the author wrote about several themes:- mother/daughter relationship and daughter/mother relationship,- child/missing father relationship,- friendship, love, marriage, respect...- the place and role of a Woman in a male dominated world.There are of course many references to Hollywood actors, actresses, and movies from the 1930's til early 1960's. This novel is also anti-Hollywood thesis revealing the dark and cruel naked truth of the Hollywood system behind the cameras, how they treated each other during the Senator McCarthy era chasing communists everywhere, how they treated each other during the production of a movie and how they treated women as simple merchandise for the sake of making millions of Dollars. Several times throughout the novel, there was an invisible frontier between what happened in real life and what happened in cinema confusing Norma Jeane, Marilyn Monroe, and the readers.This book is the longest book I've ever read in my life so far, but it is worth reading it. There are many lessons to learn from the tragic life of Norma Jeane for all of today's WOMEN and MEN."}], "description": "Marilyn Monroe, la sua vita e il suo mito, raccontati in un romanzo che d\u00e0 voce a una donna che ha incarnato l'unico vero Mito del Ventesimo secolo.
