She didn\u2019t care as Sharon had her own special friends, her dolls loved her and she loved them back. If only they wouldn\u2019t stop breaking. The heads kept falling off, glue and stitching just didn\u2019t keep them together. Perhaps she ought to stop using heads from road kill or pieces from her neighbour\u2019s dead pets?"}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4532232-irene", "userReview": "I was a bit confused at the start of the story. Eventually it came together as a fine example of what can go on in the mind of a bullied child."}, {"userName": "Andy Angel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4731969-andy-angel", "userReview": "Another good short story from Ian Woodhead. The main character Sharon is a strange one who seems to spend her time making up play stories for her dolls. This is fine behaviour until you realise how she is \"Frankensteining\" them - quite disturbing (in a good way!!).Ian captures the mean-spiritedness of children very well. Thoroughly enjoyed it, just wish it could have been longer."}, {"userName": "Pyxipyro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6113172-pyxipyro", "userReview": "Sharon is a very interesting girl with very unique hobbies."}, {"userName": "Jessica Buike", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5840964-jessica-buike", "userReview": "This is a gag-worthy short horror story that is interesting and unique! It is grossly delightful, with interesting characters and a sense of poetic justice. Just an overall fun short story!"}], "description": "", "title": "Very Dead Dolls", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10752176-very-dead-dolls", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328785116l/10752176.jpg", "reviews": 6, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4369603.Ian_Woodhead", "name": "Ian Woodhead"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4707345.Kate_Porelli", "name": "Kate Porelli"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4590395.Michelle_Woodhead", "name": "Michelle Woodhead"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10752176-very-dead-dolls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10894176-the-unwashed-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26054625-brutality", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9358877-spore", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12011477-walking-with-zombies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26815113-depravity"]}
