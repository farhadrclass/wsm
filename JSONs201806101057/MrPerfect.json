Well, in this story, you get a list detailing what these friends think it takes to make the perfect man. And what do you get when that list becomes an overnight sensation with a nearly cult like following? Well, in this story, you get murder!I\u2019ve had this book on my shelves for quite awhile and whenever my Goodreads friends would talk about Linda Howard\u2019s books, Mr. Perfect was sure to be listed as one of her very best, and almost always a favorite. So why did I put off reading this book, you ask? Because I thought the cover was ugly. And let me just tell you now, it\u2019s true what they say; you should never judge a book by its cover.Mr. Perfect  was a fun, fast paced, sexy read and once I got started I just couldn\u2019t put it down. And while the idea that such a list could become so insanely popular and cause such havoc is a bit on the farfetched side, the story was written in such a way that made it believable, and the characters were written just as well. Jaine Bright and Sam Donovan were both so perfect, and yet so flawed that they felt like real people to me, not just words and images bunched together to give us characters to read about, but honest to goodness real people. Their banter was laugh out loud funny and their sexual chemistry burned up the pages.I also loved the secondary characters who filled out the group of friends, four ladies working for the same company yet in different departments. Their love for each other was so apparent, and it made me think of a couple of my own closest friends. I could easily see us all sitting down and getting carried away, laughing and just having a great time creating our ideal man, our own Mr. Perfect. The bottom line \u2013 This was my first Linda Howard read and before I was even 1/3 of the way through I was ordering more of her books. It was fun, exciting and very sexy, so needless to say, I really enjoyed Mr. Perfect and I\u2019m looking forward to reading more by this author!4.5/5.0"}, {"userName": "Wicked Incognito Now", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541201-wicked-incognito-now", "userReview": "I only read SEVEN PERCENT of this book. So take my review with a grain of salt.I often search the internet for \"best romance novels of all time.\" There are, surprisingly, a lot of lists dedicated to enumerating the best romance novels ever written. I've found quite a few gems this way. THIS novel made the top ten of most of those lists. I spent most of my life thinking that all romance novels were a waste of my time and intellect, until I rediscovered romance about four years ago. I discovered that romance \ncan\n be well-written AND highly enjoyable and entertaining.But this novel is an example of why I turned up my nose at the genre 25 years ago.Life is too short to waste on drivel. I can see where this book is going from 1200 miles away. Four friends are in a bar having a HILARIOUS good time. OMG. Men suck. Yeah, men are so sucky. What kind of man would you want if you could have THE PERFECT MAN? OMG. Don't talk like that. You're insane. No, really. What's the perfect man? No. You're taking it too far. Heheheheheheh. Funny stuff. Seriously. Okay, he would definitely have to be faithful. Seriously? Really. Well, if you think so. Yeah, that's MOST important. What about a sense of humor? OMG. You are SO right. A sense of humor. OMG that's funny. Teehee. He should be good looking. Teehee. He should be great in bed. Teehee. He should be rich. Teehee. He should be responsible. DUDES!!! This is all so original and FUNNY. Seriously though? He should have a ten inch penis. Hmmmm.....where does the story go?....hmmm...I already know this is a murder suspense romance. The next door neighbor is a cop.....hmmm.....there is a serial killer and the title is Mr. Perfect....hmmmm.....nah, not predictable at all. I really have no idea what could possibly happen next. Oh, are the friends going to be murdered one by one? By a serial killer that heard about their original requirements for a man? Or something to that effect? WHATEVER. I seriously don't care.This is an example of severely dumbed down writing. Romance readers are idiots, right? Otherwise they would read serious literature instead of romance trash. Obviously romance readers can't handle big words or nuanced narratives. And of course, grammatical integrity, consistent voice and a plot that takes more thought than a infant can muster would just be TOO MUCH for a romance reader to handle.EXCERPT:Why on earth her mother had wanted her to baby-sit the cat, instead of Shelley or Dave, was beyond her. They both had kids who could play with BooBoo and keep him entertained. Since school was out for summer vacation, that meant someone was home at both their houses almost all day, every day.But, nooo. Jaine had to keep BooBoo. Never mind that she was single, was at work five days a week, and wasn't used to having a pet. If she did have a pet, it wouldn't be one like BooBook, anyway. He'd been in a feline pout ever since he'd been neutered, and he took out his frustration on the furniture. In just one week, he had frayed the sofa to the point that she would have to have it reupholstered.And BooBoo didn't like her. He like her well enough when he was in his home, coming around to be petted, but he didn't like being in her home at all. Every time she tried to pet him now, he arched his back and hissed at her.To top it off, Shelley was mad at her because Mom had chosen Jaine to baby-sit her precious BooBoo. After all, Shelley was the oldest, and obviously more settled. It didn't make sense that Jaine had been chosen over her. Jaine agree with her, but that didn't soothe the hurt feelings.No, what really topped it off was that David, who was a year younger than Shelley, was mad at her too. Not because of BooBoo; David was allergic to cats, No, what had him steamed was that Dad had stored his precious car in her garage--which meant she couldn't park in her own garage, since it was a single, and it was damned inconvenient. She wished David had the blasted car. She Wished Dad had left it in his own garage, but he'd been afraid to leave it unattended for six weeks. She understood that, but she didn't understand why she'd been chosen to baby-sit both cat and car. Shelley didn't understand the cat, David didn't understand the car, and Jaine didn't understand any of it.You and me BOTH Jaine! I don't understand the purpose of the entire passage. Is this an obvious set-up for future happenings in the plot? The cat will be murdered and the car destroyed? Is this a pathetic attempt at characterization? Because now I hate Jaine and think she's a whiny baby. I feel no accord with this character.Or was this merely an attempt to pad the word count?It was all so stilted. Unnecessary. Like a conversation with someone who gives you way too many details about a story they're about to tell and you're just sitting there thinking: \"Please get on with it. For the love of God--please.\""}, {"userName": "Geri Reads", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11757728-geri-reads", "userReview": "5 (Still) Perfect Stars!!Re-read time June 19 to 21 2013.Still perfect after all this time. I've reread this book more than I could count and it never fails to make me laugh, cry and swoon. This book is what made me a fan of Linda Howard's writing. This was Linda Howard at her peak writing form; witty, fun, hilarious and terrifying at the same time. Mr. Perfect is a story about four friends and their idea of Mr. Perfect. The fours friends understood, of course, that Mr. Perfect doesn't really exist in real life but that didn't stop them from making the Mr. Perfect list. It was supposed to stay between them but one thing led to another and suddenly, the ladies find themselves as the newest national sensation. Worst of all, they also attracted the attention of a very disturb and sinister mind who will stop at nothing to hurt them. As to who and why he'd want to hurt them, well, I say, you must read the book because I'm not spoiling anything. :D\nWhy I love this book...\nWe're all familiar with that book where the heroine meets the hero and it was viola! Instant attraction, lust and even love at first sight. And then we get a heroine who keeps saying in her head, \"He's so gorgeous,\" or \"he's the most beautiful man I've ever met,\" or \"he's perfect I wanna devour him.\" That plus the gushing and clenching their girly parts. This book doesn't have that. You'd get the exact opposite. First of all, Jaine (that's our female MC) thinks that Sam (our male MC) is foul-tempered drunk and a world-class jerk. No ifs and buts about it. She wasn't a bit attracted to him. In fact she contemplated on boiling her fingers because it touched him. :D \nAll she knew was that he was a rough-looking character, and he didn\u2019t seem to hold down a regular job. At best, he was a drunk, and drunks could be mean and destructive. At worst, he was involved in illegal stuff, which added dangerous to the list. He was a big, muscular guy, with dark hair cut so short he almost looked like a skinhead. Every time she had seen him, he looked as if he hadn\u2019t shaved in two or three days. Add that to the bloodshot eyes and bad temper, and she came up with drunk.\nIt was downright hilarious the moment they \"officially\" met too. And boy, was Jaine ever wrong about her first impression of the guy. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t had any sleep, any breakfast, or any coffee. I\u2019d better leave before I hurt you.\u201d He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019d hate to have to arrest you.\u201d She stared at him, taken aback. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a cop,\u201d he said, then turned and walked back into his house. Jaine stared after him, shocked. A cop? \u201cWell, fuck,\u201d she said.\nSee, what I mean? That was just refreshing to me. I always find it fascinating when a romance author tries to subvert a well known trope, in this case the insta-attraction or insta-lust trope, and give us something different.Of course, this dislike turned into something a lot more pleasant when Jaine saw Sam in his birthday suit outside her kitchen window. Jaine's inner monologue in that one was seriously funny and seriously hot. I swear reading that part made me wish, I had a hunky neighbor I could perv on. LH described Sam's nakedness and Jaine's reaction to it in way that make you laugh and turn you on at the same time. \nWhat then happened wasn\u2019t her fault. She was standing at the sink rinsing out her cup when the kitchen light in the house across the way flicked on and Sam walked into view. She stopped breathing. Her lungs seized, and she stopped breathing. \u201cSweet baby Jesus,\u201d she croaked, and managed to inhale.She was seeing more of Sam than she had ever thought she would; everything, in fact. He stood in front of the refrigerator, stark naked. She barely had time to admire his buns before he took a bottle of orange juice from the fridge, twisting off the top and tilting it to his mouth as he turned around. She forgot all about his buns. He was more impressive coming \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 than he was going, and that was saying something, because his butt was severely cute. The man was hung.\nIn spite of that encounter, they didn't immediately jump into bed and have sex. They had to work out some issues first, plus the fact there was a killer on the loose after Jaine and her friends. But when they did? YOWZA! LH writes some of the best love scenes around. She's not overly descriptive. There's almost like a brusque quality to the way she writes these scenes that does something your imagination. And for someone with a very active imagination like moi, this was just perfect for me.Sam Donovan, or as Jaine referred to him as the jerk, was a wonderfully swoony character. He is alpha without being too over the top and the jerk is funny. He can totally match Jaine in the wit department. Plus, he ain't that bad looking either. Oh, who am I kidding? Sam is gorgeous in a totally manly way and most of all, he's got the right equipment. \n\u201cI tracked it down on the Web. It was funny stuff \u2013 Ms. C.\u201d She gaped at him. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d she demanded. He snorted. \u201cLike I wouldn\u2019t recognize your smart-ass mouth even in print. \u2018Anything over eight is strictly for show-and-tell\u2019,\u201d he quoted at her. \u201cI might have known you\u2019d remember only the sex stuff.\u201d \u201cSex is much on my mind these days. And just for the record \u2013 I don\u2019t have anything for show-and-tell.\u201d If he didn\u2019t, he hadn\u2019t missed it by much, Jaine thought, remembering with great fondness how he had looked in profile. He continued, \u201cI\u2019m just happy I\u2019m not in the point-and-laugh category.\u201d\nThe story was seamlessly told in multiple POVs, with Jaine having the most of them. We also get to be inside the mind of the killer and let me tell you, it was creepy as hell and very disturbing. I have to warn you though, there is much sadness that happened in this book. I won't elaborate anything more than that but this book isn't all hearts and rainbows. But it does have an HEA.Overall, very solid and pretty much unforgettable story from Linda Howard.

But, because of the cross phases of the moon, they end up making a horrifying unbelievable bound-to-change-the-world thing - a list about how should Mr. Perfect be. On. A. Piece. Of. Paper. They add spectacular never-heard-off manly traits to it, about which any respectable woman shouldn\u2019t even dream of, less express it in writing, like how this perfect guy should be handsome, dependable, with a sense of humor, who can hold onto a job and maybe have a big dick.And that\u2019s when all hell breaks loose. \nThe list gets in the newspapers and on the evening TV news.\n You see, in this heavenly world these ladies are living in, where famine is gone, the Middle East is this peaceful glittering place, where there are no natural disasters, no global warming, no terrorists, no diseases, and where nobody cares about football, nor about the Kardashians and the Royal Family, there is absolutely nothing more important to show on the news than a list some random drunken ladies made in a bar. And, guuuurl, the horror, Lady no. 3 is in danger of divorcing because of that list. God save her soul if her husband for nine (9!!!!!) years finds out she actually believes Mr. Perfect should have a sense of humor and some money, he will be terribly offended, like the real man he is. Lady, you really should make yourself a favor and let him divorce you, buy yourself a dildo, more useful, less whiney.And when that evening news list pissed a serial killer off and triggered a murder, that\u2019s when I gave up and decided I\u2019m not so against burning books after all."}, {"userName": "Didi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6082482-didi", "userReview": "~~~~ 4 STARS OR 7.5-8/10 ~~~~Despite being released years ago, the books I've read by Linda Howard are so evocative and sexy that some newer books honestly can't compete. This is the third book by LH I've read so far but after the first, she became one of my favourite authors. Romantic suspense when written well is fantastic. I loved the suspense here, it had me stumped till past half way through when I realized I was making a grave error in my assumptions. The disturbing nature of the crimes committed were riveting and I was horrified by the inner workings of the killers mind. We get several pov's here, with the majority being Janie's, the heroine. Reading this was like solving an intelligent puzzle and I really enjoyed it.The romance was sweet but the sensuality was RAW. It's hard to write like that when tackling love scenes. But instead of drawn out sex scenes and verbal catalysts, LH zeroes in on the sexual sensuality between people. Her sexy time is short but packs an intensity no lengthy and drawn out sex scene can ever accomplish.I know I've mentioned this in previous reviews of her books, but when it's that good it deserves mentioning all over again. I loved how laid back and confident Sam was. With the Mr. Perfect list causing a huge controversy for men all over, Sam seemed to find the whole thing amusing and not at all demeaning. That's a man in charge of himself and confident in his abilities!There was a scene early on when Jaine catches Sam in his kitchen, naked, chugging back a container of milk. Instead of being embarrassed or scandalized, he relished in the ability to shock her and advertise exactly what she's been missing. Honestly, it was hot, and from then on I developed a respect for him and his security in being a real man.The only thing I found puzzling was the speed in which Sam and Jaine progressed in their relationship. It felt too insta love-ish. But even considering that, I loved their interaction and enjoyed the story very much. The ending was edge-on-your-seat good, with the killer finally reaching a desperate precipice. I loved it. If you haven't read LH before, start now!!

Another winner. I read a few reviews before I started this one, so my expectations were high. And I wasn't the least bit disappointed! A few people had a hard time with the insta-love between Jaine and Sam, but for some reason it didn't bother me a bit. In fact I felt it added to Sam's incredible charm and cocky appeal. He knew what he wanted, and he didn't waste any time playing games. What's not to love about that? I have to admit, I have a serious girl-crush on Jaine. She was so mouthy and sarcastic. A girl after my own heart. She also didn't even try to fight off the strong feelings she had for Sam. No head games here. Just a straight shooter. They were perfect together. \n\"I don't know how serious it is,\" she said, knowing she was lying. \"I'm not rushing into anything.\" For her part, she couldn't get much more serious. She was in love with the big jerk. Exactly how or what he felt was still open for discussion.\nThe story was very suspenseful. The killer was one sick individual. And that final showdown... wow!

The romance is out of this world, both main characters are just so perfect for each other, it also helped the fact that they couldn't stand each other, I'm especially in love with love/hate relationships - you have to admit it always makes things more interesting when they unfold.Linda Howard did everything right while writing this book, for this book is a master-piece and has won a very-well deserved place on my favorites list. - Unforgettable!"}, {"userName": "*TANYA*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29049556-tanya", "userReview": "This book was soooo GOOD!!!

But well, the murders bothered me. The 1st victim was the best of their ladies-group. Very likable woman. The 2nd victim was nice, but weak toward her man (who screwed around on her for one year and then suddenly wanted her and she accepted his lame excuse, the day before she was killed).

Now I finally understand the popular line ... \"I'm not holding you against your will; I'm holding you against your car.\" This book was full of verbal sparring between Jaine Bright and her neighbor, Detective Sam Donovan, that was downright hilarious at times. Jaine first meets Sam when she accidentally backs over his metal garbage can with her new Viper. Tempers flare as these two discover a strong, immediate attraction that they both try to deny. Their first kiss takes place when Jaine is washing her car - no spoilers here! - but it is one of the funniest and sexiest that I have ever read.The storyline of the four friends and their silly list of qualifications for Mr. Perfect makes for a nice secondary plot. However, a creepy character committing two, gruesome murders as a result of the list was overly familiar to me - it reminded me of a movie that I once saw. But all in all, I loved this book! I'm not sure why I let it sit in my TBR pile for so long, but I highly recommend it and I may re-read it myself just for grins and giggles."}, {"userName": "Jo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14323468-jo", "userReview": "\u201cTell me something,\u201d he said conversationally, strolling beside her as she stalked, as best as she was able, to her car. \u201cIs there ever a day when you don\u2019t pick a fight?\u201d\u201cThe days when I don\u2019t see you,\u201d she shot back.\n I have read many books, and this book is still the book with the best bantering between the hero and the heroine. I LOVE this book, have re-read it many times, and it\u2019s still one of my favorite books of all time.  \nIt was a good thing she was off men, or she really might have charged across the two driveways and right up to his kitchen door. But off men or not, she still appreciated art, and her neighbour was a work of art, hovering somewhere between classic Grecian statue and porn star.\n Janie is the perfect heroine. She\u2019s sassy and feisty and so funny. I just loved her. She recently bought her first house, and she loves everything about it, except for her rude neighbour, who must be a drunk and busy with illegal activities because of his blood shot eyes, dirty clothes and the unusual hours he comes home. But then she finds out he\u2019s a cop, and things gets very interesting between them.  \nShe attacked life, rather than simply letting it happen; he\u2019d never before met anyone so annoying and funny and sharp. He had major plans for her, the most immediate of which was getting her under him. No way would he let anything happen to her, even if he had to quit his job and become her twenty-four-hour-a-day bodyguard.\n Sam is the perfect hero. He\u2019s brash, confident, so sexy and not shy at all. He\u2019s a cop that works strange hours, trying to work on his house in his spare time, and his new neighbour has something against him getting sleep. But after another heated encounter, he can\u2019t help but notice the very strong and hard effect his feisty neighbour has on him.  But then the list that Janie and her three friends drunkenly made of the Perfect Man, suddenly becomes famous, and triggers the attention of a killer, who is set on killing the ladies of the list.  \n\n\u201cI always heard that sex was different with a woman you loved, but I didn\u2019t believe it. Sex was sex. Then I got inside you and it was like sticking my cock in an electrical outlet.\u201d\u201cOh. Was that what all that shaking and yelling was about?\u201d She sniffled, but she was paying attention.\u201cSmart-ass. Yeah, that\u2019s what it was about, not that I was the only one doing some shaking and yelling. It was different. Hotter. Stronger. And when it was over, I wanted to do it all over again.\u201d\n\n The romance was FANTASTIC!! I loved the hilarious banter between Janie and Sam, their scorching attraction, and the fact that the more time they spent together the more they wanted to be in each other\u2019s company. These two are one of the most perfect couples ever.  \n\u201cI kept you from sleeping? I kept you from sleeping?\u201d he repeated incredulously. \u201cYou are the same woman who shook me out of a sound sleep at two A.M. yesterday morning, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t shake you. I kind of bounced on you, but I didn\u2019t shake you.\u201d\u201cBounced,\u201d he repeated.\u201cYou had a hard-on. I couldn\u2019t let it go to waste, could I?\u201d\u201cYou could have woke me up before you started not letting it go to waste.\u201d\u201cLook,\u201d she said, exasperated, \u201cif you don\u2019t want it used, don\u2019t lie on your back with it sticking up like that. If that isn\u2019t an invitation, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n And the sexy times \u2026. HOT DAMN!! The sparks flying between these two were AWESOME and just explosive!!!!  \n\u201cIs it possible for men to have PMS?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t need it,\u201d Jaine said, thinking of her jerk of a neighbour \u2013 a cop jerk. \u201cThey\u2019re born with testosterone poisoning.\u201d\n Janie\u2019s group of friends were just fantastic and hilarious, and I loved them.  As always Linda Howard writes an intriguing plot, and I loved trying to figure out who the killer was.  I love this author, and this book is one of my favorites. If you love hilarious banter between main characters, a romance that is so hot it will burn your fingers and a very suspenseful plot, this is the book for you.

I was up till 5:30 in the morning finishing this and when I got to the end I wanted more, more Jaine and Sam. I loved the romance and wanted so much more. Jaine was a firecracker and I loved her. She was soo kick-ass and knew cars and didn't mind speaking her mind and throwing herself in the fray.She just bought a house, her siblings are miffed with her since her vacation parents left their cat and her dad's prized car in her possession. She also thinks her neighbour is a drunk boor, proof he is dressed badly, comes in late and always looks hungover and then she finds out is because he is a cop on a task force. They have the most hilarious and sexy encounters. Sam has a habit of sneaking up on her and she has a habit of using a lot of cuss words and they have a hilarious conversation about eggs.On a Friday night after work, she and her friends make a list of Mr Perfect and that list goes public and viral bringing a lot of attention to them and a psycho killer. One of the friends gets murdered and so does another one later. The mystery and romance are perfectly blended. This is pure vintage Linda Howard at her best. I loved the romance, despite being whirlwind it worked for me. Even the fights between Jaine and Sam were sexy. Jaine had been anti-men since by the age of 23 she had three broken engagements under her belt but with Sam there was instant fire between them.I so didn't want this book to end."}, {"userName": "Bj", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27341466-bj", "userReview": "4.5 \"What Does the Perfect Man Mean to You\" Stars for the story and 5 stars for the narration!Proving that a great romance is timeless, Linda Howard's Mr. Perfect, first published in 2000, was pretty near close to perfect. Yes, there were the occasional markers that undoubtedly branded this romance gem with some antiquated technology device references (who remembers answering machines, when cell phones were optional, and caller id required a little machine attachment rather than being built-in to your phone?), but the witty banter and raw appeal between the hero and heroine was exactly what I look for in a top-favorite romance. Moreover, Ms. Howard works double time and also manages to mix in a good dose of suspense to further enhance this home library, romance shelf keeper! As if this weren't reason enough to dust off your old copy of Mr. Perfect, or indulge in purchasing a brand new copy, Laura Hick's fabulously, gifted narration makes this a story that is a fantastic audiobook pick!Ladies the world over have at one time or another pondered the question: What kind of man would be the perfect man? But when 4 co-workers, after a few drinks imbibed after work, decide to put pen to paper with their list of Mr. Perfect attributes, \"the List\" sky-rockets to instant fame. Not only is their whole workplace buzzing with the gossip of what did and didn't make the list, but even the media takes notice and starts hounding the ladies for interviews and guest appearances. However, not all the attention is good, and when the Mr. Perfect list hits a raw nerve with an individual who takes the list as a personal insult, the girls' bit of fun takes a potentially deadly turn. Fortunately, for Jaine Bright, one of the four list makers and the main heroine from the Mr. Perfect romantic arc perspective, she has one rather irritating and yet equal parts alluring neighbor (Sam Donovan) who may just be the answer to this potentially dangerous situation. Sam Donovan is the kind of alpha hero romance readers swoon over, and a police detective to boot, so he gets right on the case and makes it his top priority to ensure Jaine's safety. But will he be successful with a seriously unbalanced predator on the loose? Moreover, with the dangerous matter at hand, not too mention their volatile interactions together, does Sam stand a chance of being Jaine's Mr. Perfect?See the full review at BJ's Reviews.Source: Review copy provided for review purposes. eStories.com allows anyone to download audiobooks.

I loved the protagonists but I hated the story. Very tough to rate this one.The banter between the two was some of the best I read from LH. Jaine is a quirky, feisty, thoroughly modern and very likable woman. When she starts sparring with her grumpy but oh so sexy next door neighbor, Detective Sam Donovan, I felt like I could get a tub of popcorn and just sit there watching them exchange insults, flirtations, and hot kisses all day long.\n\"Tell me something,\u201d\n he asks her after she got herself into yet another predicament, \n\"Is there ever a day when you don\u2019t pick a fight?\u201d \u201cThe days when I don\u2019t see you,\u201d\n she shoots right back at him.Later, when she catches him strutting naked in his kitchen, her first thought is to run right over to his house \n\"to audition as his mattress.\"\"Don\u2019t kiss me,\u201d\n she warns him on their next encounter, even though that's exactly what she wants him to do.\n\"I don\u2019t intend to ,\u201d\n he quips, \nI don\u2019t have my whip and chair with me.\"\nAnd so on and so forth. So why did I not rate this book higher, when it had me chuckling at almost every page? It was the \"suspense\" part of this \"romantic suspense\" story that ruined it for me.The plot is centered on a woman-hating serial killer who targets Jaine and her close-knit group of friends because they made up a silly list of the attributes they would wish on an ideal man, a \"Mr. Perfect\", which became a viral national news interest story and sparked a kind of gender war between the women who rallied to their \"sisters\" and the men who were offended and disgusted by some of the items on the list.My problem is that it was very difficult for me to imagine that the list the ladies came up with would elicit any interest whatsoever even in the ancient, genteel, and innocent times we know as the 1990s. *sarcasm* It was so tame, talking about how men should be faithful and have a sense of humor and at the end, that they should be good looking and good in bed, preferably with a ten inch penis. Really? In the era where serious newscasters, political pundits and lawyers calmly discussed blow jobs in the oval office, and sperm stains on Gap dresses, on national and international media, you are telling me that Good Morning America and People Magazine would descend on an obscure group of low level corporate employees who were simply having a laugh at happy hour and give them their fifteen minutes of fame based on a highly controversial list like this? Sorry, just didn't buy it.As for the psycho who goes after them because they offended his sensibilities with their crude, vulgar, whorish ways, he was a cartoon character Frankensteined from the equally buffoonish villains featured on popular crime/horror movies and TV shows like Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, Dressed to Kill or Law & Order.I really enjoy LH' signature witty and sexy banter but this story has not aged well (one scene has the detective patiently wait for thirty minutes for a file to download from his email to his computer lol, characters struggle with cell phones, etc.) and its cringe-inducing shortcomings eventually marred my enjoyment of two hot, funny, and likable characters. Can we please revive Jaine and Sam and plunk them down in a worthy story?"}, {"userName": "maggieandteddy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15076466-maggieandteddy", "userReview": "I've been dying to read Mr Perfect for a long time. I loved the characters from the first chapter. The 3rd person POV was perfect in this case. Like a fly on the wall. This book was written in 2000, which is only 15 years ago. The humor, and the situations are still relevant- for the most part. Some expressions seemed dated and the technology as well: pagers, limited use of cell phones, caller ID devices, etc. Jaine had just moved into her house a couple of weeks prior. Sam lived next door. Jaine's first impression of him was hilarious and I loved the scene of her peeking at him. Jaine and Sam's chemistry was fantastic. Jaine had some funny lines, but Sam was quite the cut up too. I loved how he let her know that he was very interested in her. And Jaine explains to her girlfriends that she's reconsidering her 'jerk' opinion of Sam: Jaine squirmed in the booth, feeling her face get even hotter. 'It isn't my fault', she blurted defensively. \"He has a red truck. A four-wheel drive.\"Jaine was witholding the fact that Sam was smokin' hot!Jaine and her friends Marci, T.J. and Luna work at the same company. After work on a Friday, girls' night out, they discuss & list the qualities that they want in a \"Perfect Man\". Their \"list\" gets leaked and published and spreads around like wild fire. They go from anonymous to infamous. The news and entertainment media hounds them. They go from embarrassed to what's the big deal. Jaine and Sam get closer really fast-- as the impact of the LIST takes an ugly turn. The shifting from sexy times, to wise cracks to suspense was done very well in my opinion. The villain was very bad & twisted. I was able to figure out WHO about 1/2 way through the book. Sam is a cop and takes a very active role in protecting Jaine and trying to ID and catch the villain. The villain strikes very suddenly. The shock factor was out of control. One minute I'm cracking up with Jaine & Sam, the next minute, I'm just flat out stunned. I wanted to yell at my kindle!I read this during a busy pre-holiday time. My job never slowed down-grr. Real life always gets in the way of my reading!
