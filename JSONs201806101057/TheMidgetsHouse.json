Now I might have been a bit pre-disposed to enjoy it considering it\u2019s full of things that interest me: ghosts, history and circus performers, but there is enough charm and grace in the book to entrance any reader.The book essentially tells the story of two women, Marisa, who is starting her life over after loss, and the ghostly Lucinda, whose truth has been lost in time. Their stories interweave in a fascinating tale of mystery, ghosts, romance, and circus history until they collide in a tense conclusion.The perspective of this novel is told from two points-of views, Marisa\u2019s and Lucinda\u2019s, and shifts the reader back and forth from the modern day to the early 20th century. Now this change could have easily become disjointed, but the author makes the transition seamless, and as a reader I flowed through the story effortlessly. Both Marisa and Lucinda are compelling characters -never seeming helpless or weak, even when they faced adversity- and you are naturally pulled into their captivating parallel stories.The book is also rich in alluring backdrops of setting and description. Both worlds come to life exquisitely as the book takes you on a charismatic journey through modern Florida and the bygone era of the heydays of carnivals and circuses. This lovely detailing keeps the book\u2019s pace flowing perfectly until the end.The Midget\u2019s House is an easy and enthusiastic recommend"}, {"userName": "Cheryl Landmark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4411217-cheryl-landmark", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. It was an awesome blend of historical fiction, paranormal spookiness and intriguing mystery and was very well-written. The two separate viewpoints--Lucinda's and Marisa's--could very well have made the story disjointed, but the author did an excellent job of keeping the transition between their POV's and different timelines flowing smoothly and effortlessly.Lucinda's story was the highlight of the book for me with her descriptions of life as a midget \"freak\" in circuses and sideshows in the 1920's. She was a great character, who, despite all the ridicule and insults she received as a little person, still managed to remain strong and beautiful.Marisa's modern day timeline also had its enjoyable aspects with her struggles to keep the intriguing Midget House from being demolished by land developers.The author obviously spent a great deal of time researching her topic and it shows in the excellent writing.

The house has been built for a midget. Marisa, who had lived in the cottage for a short time in childhood inherits it quite unexpectedly. She moves in and learns a developer is trying to get the land to build condos, the taxes haven't been paid in several years, and weird things keep happening in the house itself. The chapters go back and forth between now and the 1920's freak shows that were part of every circus. Lucinda is a midget who joined the circus when it was traveling through TN. It was interesting to learn about circus life. Marisa investigates the history of her house and learns , in the words of Paul Harvey, the rest of the story about a pivotal event in the mid 1920's.The book is fiction but the author lives in a cottage in Sarasota built for midgets."}, {"userName": "Tisha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11363171-tisha", "userReview": "I wish there was a 4.5 rating on this book, because that was what I would give this very good book. The setting jumps between the \"freak\" shows of the 1920's circus culture and current day Florida's real-estate boom. This book is similar in a lot of ways to Water for Elephants, which I also liked. As the title says, it is a love story, a ghost story and a circus story. With that many genres, it could make a book seem jumbled, but Ms. Bartholomew did a great job at making all the elements work together very well. The writing flowed well enough, even given the jumps in setting, to allow me to forget I was reading and just feel like I was experiencing the story. This, to me, is the litmus test for a good book.All in all, a really good book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good read."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685573-christine", "userReview": "I read this book on the kindle, and also was able to get it for free.As a little kindle read, and as a free book, I was pretty pleased with it.

I really need to stop overrating the books I really really like and leave five stars for books that I love as much as this one. The characters, the story, the voices are so vivid that reading it was practically a hallucinatory experience for me. I could totally differentiate between individual voices and when the ghost spoke, she sounded like she was giving a fascinating oral history.Inspired by the author's own Sarasota home and its surrounding history of circus employees, it is a ghost story about Lucinda's early 20th-century life as a circus midget and her doomed love affair with the circus owner. Lucinda's story runs parallel with story of the house's current 21st-century inhabitant, Marisa--a single (divorced) woman with a nice cat and very bad judgement in men. Because of her own personal history with the house, Marisa feels called upon to save the house, surrounding land and its wildlife from developers. She feels pitted against and afraid of the ghost Lucinda because she does not know her story. However, we the readers are privvy and sympathetic to the Lucinda's history, learning a little more and a little more, several steps ahead of Marisa, as we go.I particularly loved the interesting historical factoids and the side stories about the 1918 Spanish influenza epidemic and the effect of WW I on the circus performers. I also really appreciated the acknowledgement of gay love, both then and now. I loved the many details about living in circus communities and the humanizing of the \"freaks.\"The author clearly did a lot of loving, personalized research into circus history and culture. She writes very respectfully of the \"freaks\" who otherwise might have had no employment because they were either born poor or visibly different. Much like sex workers, they learned to earn money from their bodies while disdaining and cheating the \"rubes\" on their circuits, who paid cash from their pockets to be shocked and awed. Lots of food for thought about how human beings mistreat and exploit one another based on appearance and lack of wealth.The ending is so satisfying, even though it is a bit too neat. I just really wanted happiness for Lucinda and Marisa and was happy to get it, even at cost to credibility. I finished the book awash in goosebumps. Will read again! Very grateful I got it via free download. :)This review also appears on Amazon."}, {"userName": "\u0466\u047a\u2122", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4555905", "userReview": "\"It always amazes me to think that every house on every street is full of so many stories; so many triumphs and tragedies, and all we see are yards and driveways.\" - Glenn CloseMarisa Delano's elation at inheriting a house straight from the pages of a fairy tale book turns dismal and terrifying. there are expenses that need to be settled and other people want a piece of Marisa's house. moreover, Lucinda Lacey's ghost is reaching beyond the grave to stake her claim on the property as well. author Anita Bartholomew's novel takes the reader on a trip down memory lane to the circuses and freak shows of the early twentieth century to modern-day Florida. the voices of Marisa and Lucinda alternate throughout the book. each woman tells her story and despite the differences in time and circumstances, both of them are bound by one single thing - a house. i enjoyed reading about the early days of the circus and what the whole troupe had to undergo in order to make a living and entertain crowds across America. without demystifying the appeal circuses have for me, i also found amusing some inside information about them. between the two women, i was more fascinated with Lucinda's character. i could just imagine the world she grew up and lived in as a midget. despite her stature, she comes across as a very strong person. she is equally vulnerable to taunts and ridicule because of her size but she remains confident and beautiful inside and out. in addition, her love affair makes the whole book interesting because the origin and secrets of the house are tied to it. Ms. Bartholomew's writing really stands out whenever Lucinda speaks especially when she describes how Lucinda attempts to find her way from the other side to the world of the living. those interludes had a lyrical and dream-like quality to them. overall, a good book with a good story and i would recommend it those who love the circus, enjoy a bit of romance and would not mind having a ghost thrown into the bargain."}, {"userName": "Marti", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7224922-marti", "userReview": "While this book sometimes seemed to move a bit slowly, I did like it quite a lot. It basically has 2 main characters, Marisa and Lucinda. In 2004, Marisa's life was pretty much going off the rails. She'd gotten out of a disastrous marraige and not long after that, her beloved mother had died. When she learned that she'd inherited a house from a distant relative in Sarasota, FL, she felt it was a sign of a way for her to make a fresh, new start. Unfortunately, there were many problems with the house including the many rumors that it had been haunted. More \"real world\" problems included the fact that the house was in poor condition, and a developer was threatening to use Imminent Domain to seize the house in order to make a new set of McMansions. Lucinda, a little person, who lived in the early part of the 20th century, had traveled with the circus after her beloved brother helped her escape from her abusive father. She didn't really like being gawked at as a freak, but it was a better life than the one from which she had escaped. The chapters generally alternate between Marisa's story and Lucinda's. Of course, eventually, their stories do coincide. There had been a terrible fire which had killed Lucinda and another person and Lucinda had been blamed. When Marisa found that out, she still wanted the house but was pretty afraid to stay there. This book came to a very satisfying conclusion. I would readily recommend this book, especially those who like more than one genre included within the confines of one book."}, {"userName": "Shari Larsen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2751691-shari-larsen", "userReview": "This novel is the tale of two women, one alive, one long since dead, each mourning lost love and struggling for control of the one place that feels like home.Marisa is thrilled when she inherits the enchanting, fairy-tale like cottage in Sarasota, Florida, after her Aunt Enid passes away, until she learns that Lucinda Lacey, a sideshow midget who died on the property in 1924, still inhabits it.

Lucinda is a spirit that is stuck in the house & Marisa can feel her presence & all the odd things happening around her.The story flips back & forth so we get to see what happened in the past as well as what Marisa was doing with the house in the present...I absolutely loved this book... didnt want it to end.I loved hearing about Lucinda's life & how she traveled with the circus & carnivals & the people she met, who became her friends, & the man she fell in love with, Cyprus.& I loved hearing about Marisa - a child who grew up in this house when her aunt owned it & then inherited it when her aunt passed away.

Switching between the carnivals, circuses, and freak shows of the early twentieth century, and the boom-and-bust of today's Florida, Lucinda's life story unfolds as Marisa searches for answers about the strange presence in her new home. The diminutive Lucinda might not be as benign as she first seems. Did Lucinda murder her lover on the day she died? And, if so, is Marisa in danger? THE MIDGET\u2019S HOUSE was inspired by the author's own house in Sarasota, Florida, that, if local legend is to be believed, was built for the little people of the Ringling Bros. Circus, and is haunted to this day by at least one of them.", "title": "The Midget's House", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29250602-the-midget-s-house", "average": 3.7, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1456222423l/29250602.jpg", "reviews": 89, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4077278.Anita_Bartholomew", "name": "Anita Bartholomew"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Romance", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29250602-the-midget-s-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13331841-the-midget-s-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13421008-the-midget-s-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8429870-something-to-prove"]}
