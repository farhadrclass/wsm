Yeah, that. I had a huge review for this written and ready to go. I talked about the incredible characterization, the complexity of the plot, the gorgeous writing, and the mind blowing way that they were all executed. And you know what? I can\u2019t post it. It doesn\u2019t do this book justice. So for now, I\u2019ll say this:Some authors are simply writers; they take words and put them down on the page. Some authors are poets; they take those words and twist them around into beautiful prose. Then some authors, like this author, are weavers. They take those words and that beautiful prose and work them into immensely complicated storylines. These lines become the thread with which they knit their books into creation. They stitch them to and fro as they weave a literary tapestry and while reading, you get mere glimpses of the pattern they\u2019re creating. Only at the end is the grand design revealed, and when it is, you can do nothing but sit back and wonder at the beauty in front of you. Thank you, Mr. Staveley, for reminding me of ALL the reasons that I love to read. This book kept me on the edge of my seat. This book gave me actual adrenaline rushes. This book was unputdownable. This book blew my fucking mind. Favorite Fantasy book of the year...maybe even ever.More to come if I can figure out some way to do this justice.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Petrik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik", "userReview": "Buddy read with  The Queen of the Unhewn Throne, Melanie. Thank you Mel for such an amazing BR, you made my reading experience much better! :)Before I start my review, feast your eyes upon the gorgeous books cover of this trilogy!To be honest, when starting this book, I knew next to nothing about \u2018The Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne\u2019 trilogy other than the gorgeous covers it have and some great praises from my trusted friends on Goodreads. That\u2019s enough to made me enthusiastic about reading the trilogy and it\u2019s suffice to say that The Emperor\u2019s Blade, Brian Staveley\u2019s debut work managed to meet my expectation differently. Brian used to teach history, religion and philosophy for 10 years before writing this debut novel and it\u2019s really evident from the book that he knows his material strongly. The story, like a place in the book called Hook manage to hooked (see what I did there?) me right from the first three chapters. The fact that the narrative is written in my favorite type of perspective really helps, it\u2019s written from 3rd person limited, which means we get to see all events without making the main characters devoid of feelings. Like almost every high fantasy series, the plot started out quite simple, this time with each of the Emperor\u2019s Blades sent away to train in different areas of the world by the Emperor himself for the future of the Annurian Empire. Of course, an unforeseen event (it\u2019s written in the blurb if you want to know) happened and things spiraled out of control. This is where the story really began and I\u2019ll leave the rest for you to find out but the book is an adult military high fantasy filled with philosophy, faith, politics, conspiracies, mystery and especially coming of age aspects depending on whose perspective you\u2019re reading from and in my opinion, they\u2019re all \u2018Kent-kissing\u2019 great to read.While it\u2019s true that the plot for me is intriguing, it needed to be said the pacing is really slow at times. Now, this doesn\u2019t bother me at all since I find what the main characters experienced really captivating, especially Kaden. However, in terms of the pacing itself, the book reminded me a lot of The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie. Meaning the first book is more like a buildup for the sequels even though a lot of plot introduced in it are resolves already.The Emperor\u2019s Blades, as you probably can guess already are The Emperor\u2019s three offspring and the three main characters of the story. Imo the world-building aspect and the characters are the most important point of this book and whether or not you\u2019re going to enjoy it will depends on how much you love them since the plot is really character and world-driven. Throughout the whole book we\u2019ll be following the story only from the POV of the 3 main characters, Kaden, Valyn & Adare.Kaden, (17 years old) the youngest son and the Heir to the Unhewn Throne which were sent away to train with the Shin monks in the mountains. Frankly, this is the first time I ever read anything from a POV of a monk and I find it a refreshing experience to read. Usually, in cases like this the heir to the throne will be someone who learned or strong in politics accompanied with charismatic presence, Kaden is none of these. His POV is where most of the religious philosophical aspect of the book came to play the most. The teaching of the monks itself resembled Buddhism a lot with a few twist on their methods of training and punishments but above all they value discipline, calmness, and vaniate (think of this as a state of emptiness) the most. Some interesting character development happened to Kaden throughout his story and judging from how the plot ends in this entry, there\u2019s a lot of potential for his development in the sequels.\u201cFear is blindness, calmness is sight.\u201dValyn, (18 years old) the second son which were sent away to train with the Kettral, the deadliest fighting force in the Annurian Empire and personally, my favorite POV in the book. The front cover to the Hungarian edition of The Emperor\u2019s Blades featuring Valyn hui\u2019Malkeenian and a kettral at the backValyn\u2019s POV is imo, the best out of the three. It\u2019s engaging, full of mysteries, well paced and even though the plot focused mostly on his training to become a Kettral, it remains captivating. His POV is where the military fantasy aspect and a huge amount of wise philosophical quotes existed. \n\u201cLeadership isn't just about giving orders. A fool can give orders. A leader listens. He changes his mind. He acknowledges mistakes.\u201d\nFlying giant birds called kettral for war and transportation, usage of magic, realistic and unique military training, conspiracies, assassination, forming a team called Wings and accompanied with really well written side female characters, Ha Lin, Gwenna, Annick, everything in his POV just works really well for me. Plus the fact that out of the trio, Valyn have the most highlight here which makes his characters more developed compared to the others.Finally, Adare (21 years old), the first daughter and the only one who remained in Annur to maintain the politics of the Empire. Now, this is the main cons of the book for me. No, it\u2019s not because she\u2019s a bad character, the politics are greatly written and it\u2019s thrilling while it\u2019s there. However, it\u2019s because that she has only literally 5 chapters out of 50 which bothers me, not to mention they are all really short. Even though this is still the first book and I know there will be huge parts coming for her in the sequels, it still doesn\u2019t justify the reason she has very few parts compared to the others. This make her really undeveloped and more of a side character compared to other female characters in Valyn\u2019s POV, which have much more development and intrigue compared to her because of this circumstances.Brian Staveley has done a terrific job on his writings and world-building. The writings, consisting of some heavy words remain pleasant to read, humorous (mostly crude sex jokes), and the paragraphs are well structured. The world building aspects are done with a touch of Asian culture and it\u2019s implemented gradually together with the plot. This means there is no info dump and we learn more and more of the world with each chapter. 3 races, 16 Gods, monsters, magic, mythology and legends are all introduced carefully along with the plot, need I say more?Now on to the other cons of the book, other than the main problem I had with Adare\u2019s really short chapters, the other minor problems I have with the book is in its naming and climax. Some of the names in this book are hard to remember and pronounce, combined with the fact there are a LOT of new names and terminology needed to be memorize, it made some parts confusing and take times to get used to. However, the worst part is the BAD naming, here\u2019s an example of what I\u2019m talking about, Kettral. I mentioned earlier that Valyn is training to become a Kettral, the deadliest force of the Annurian Empire and yes, Kettral is a great name and memorable but it\u2019s the fact that the giant bird the Kettral ride is literally called \u2013guess what?- kettral (without the capital letter) as well that became an annoyance for me. This may be a minor peeves of mine but it gets really confusing and annoying at first. Imagine this kind of conversation (not a direct quote)\u201cA Kettral needs to ride a kettral to be a fully fledged Kettral. Without kettral, Kettral is nothing. His kettral is what makes him a Kettral.\u201dWhy can\u2019t it be named anything else other than that? Why can\u2019t it be named Kettrul or Kettrol? This is just an example of a kind of bad naming I\u2019m talking about. Hopefully this won\u2019t bother you that much as it did for me.Lastly, the last con of the book is that I find the climax a bit underwhelming. It\u2019s not bad, I just expected more out of it. The actions in the climax is more or less the same as some of the actions happening in the book previously except that it\u2019s longer but not long enough. Personally I find the Hull\u2019s Trial that Valyn\u2019s faced to be a better sequence compared to the climax of the book.Although The Emperor\u2019s Blades are inflicted with some minor problems, it still remains a \u2018Kent-kissing\u2019 great debut by Brian Staveley. It's obvious how Brian\u2019s staveley previous major really played a huge part in delivering this quality. After closing the last page, I can\u2019t wait to dive straight into the sequel, The Providence of Fire. There are a lot of foundation laid out for the sequel and it\u2019s safe to say, the quality of the book doesn\u2019t disappoint the gorgeous book covers it have.Booknest"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I better love this because my dad bought it for me and girls of all ages want to love a book their dad bought! \u2764\ufe0f**Okay, so it wasn't a 5 start review but I still liked the book.

Which is basically everyone. I won't play stupid. I can see why fans of epic fantasy might like this book and I admit to being picky when it comes to the traditional fantasy genre. And I'll also say that I can see on some level that this book is well-written. I say \"on some level\" because I judge quality of writing not only by the author's ability to spin a nice phrase, but also by their ability to write a compelling and engaging plot.That was missing for me.I suppose I should also mention that I didn't read the last quarter and I'd already started skim-reading by the third quarter. So maybe... just maybe... the last part of the story takes a turn for the epic and would have kicked my indifference for this book right where it hurts. But I don't have the patience or the reading time to waste on finding out. What I did read was - and I'm sorry again to all the book's fans - so so fucking boring.Actually no, I'll give credit where it's due - the prologue was fantastic. It was a short, brutal and horrifying opening that had me feeling glad I'd taken a chance on the book. It was all downhill from there. So, as I said, I am so so picky when it comes to \u201cepic fantasy\u201d - my attention span isn\u2019t a great partner for the generally slow pacing of these kinds of books. But I've found ones to love like The Name of the Wind and Half a King, so there's always some hope left for me.Part of me wants to say this book is slow because hell, did it feel like it! But stuff was constantly happening. Action scenes were frequent and bloody. People died. Others were betrayed. Secret feelings of love are revealed. Everything is at stake... and I just didn't care. The action scenes were so dry and lacking in suspense. Sure, they had gory descriptions; but there was zero investment in the story or characters on my part.The three protagonists all have their own stories to tell and, despite the differences between their individual experiences and situations, I could hardly tell them apart. They never moved me, never got me to care. I'm already forgetting about them. And, even though the book is made up of constant scenes of action, the actual main plotline had made hardly any progress by the halfway point of the novel. The new emperor was still stuck in the same place he was at the beginning. I felt like I was trying to wade through thick mud while reading this book.With such a high average rating and a million dazzling reviews from my trusted friends, it seems it must just be me. But I couldn't stop my eyes from running ahead on the page and wanting it to just be over.Oh well *shrugs*"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "This reading experience was something that I'll never forget. This world truly is a unique take on epic fantasy, and quickly became one of my favorite immersions. Among all the action, twists, and turns, this book somehow became one of the most addicting things I've read in a long time. I never wanted to put it down, and I'm currently deciding if I'm going to ignore my TBR and pick up The Providence of Fire immediately after I post this review.  This is a story about the Emperor's three children, all living very different lives, and all having very different points of view:Kaden - The Emperor in waiting, training with monks that are secluded in the far off mountains. \n\n\u201cBelieve what you see with your eyes, trust what you hear with your ears; know what you feel with your flesh. The rest is dream and delusion.\u201d\n\nAdare - Minister of Finance, living in the capitol and not knowing who to trust.\n\n\u201cMen tend to die when you slide steel beneath their skin and wiggle it around. Even priests.\u201d\n\nValyn - Cadet, training to become a Kettral, which is a very high rank and a very prestigious title in their military that flies with a group on a giant bird. Yes, you read that right. \n\n\u201cPut a man\u2019s back to the wall, and he\u2019s got no choice but to fight; offer him a comfortable retirement before the age of twenty, and you learn who\u2019s committed to the cause.\u201d\n\nI'll admit, I was a little biased towards Adare's point of view, because her storyline has such a strong feministic undertone. Unfortunately, Adare also gets a considerably less amount of chapters than her brothers, but I was enthralled each time we got a glimpse of her story in Annur. I have very high hopes for her in The Providence of Fire, especially with the impact of that cliffhanger. Like, I'm here for Adare, and I'm rooting for whatever she has to do for her kingdom. Kaden was my favorite of the two brothers, but that was probably because I felt so bad for him all the time. Not only was he the last to know important information, he was also being abused constantly by Tan. I mean, obviously Tan ended up stepping up his game later on, but it was giving me Severus Snape vibes throughout the entire first half; just because you do something good in the end doesn't erase all the bad shit you did earlier. Valyn's chapters for sure grew on me. At first, I thought he was the reason the book felt a little slow, but then, once his story starting going, his chapters ended up being the most addicting. Even with Kaden being borderline tortured, Valyn was the one that broke my heart and evoked so much emotion from me, while I was reading. Also, he is sitting on a pretty big secret that is for sure showing the power of the side effects, so I am probably most excited for his part in The Providence of Fire.There is also an awesome mystery surrounding the Csestriim and the Nevariim, both of which predate humans. We find out very little about them in this book, but you can easily tell that they will be the focal point moving forward, and I'm so excited. This world felt so magical and new, the writing is suburb, the side characters are battling the main characters for space in my heart, the mystery is all consuming and makes this book impossible to put down, and the story was just downright good. Seriously, I don't have anything negative to say about this book. The only thing I can possibly think of is that Adare didn't get enough chapters. Oh wait, no, I do have one major complaint about this book: I hated \"kent-kissing\" being used constantly! Like, I actually fucking despised it. At first it was fine, but it became so redundant I just couldn't deal. In general, 99% of the time I will dislike when authors make up their own swear words, but this was even worse because \"kent-kissing\" was used constantly.But besides that, this was such an amazing reading experience. Mostly because I was able to personally buddy read this with three of my favorite people on Goodreads! Please read Petrik (King of the Unhewn Throne), Gelisvb (My favorite person to fangirl with on Goodreads), and Cory's (The best Holy Paladin in the entire world of Azeroth) reviews if you have some spare time. They are nothing short of perfect, and I am so thankful to have been able to buddy read this beautiful story alongside them. Plus, they are all really great humans who will make your feed better in general. Now, is it time for me to ignore all my ARCs and responsibilities and read The Providence of Fire? I think so! Seriously, I need more of this world. I whole heartedly recommend you giving this series a shot, because I think very few will walk away disappointed.

I\u2019ve very mixed feelings so bear with me here. I'd also like to add that this is after all the first book in the series and when have I ever been blown away by first books, save for some few exceptions here and there? Can\u2019t win \u2018em all now, can we?Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved it and I found the world and magic system to be especially thrilling and fascinating that invite reader investment but that's not to say it wasn\u2019t without its problems. Characters:The book kicks off with the emperor assassinated and his heirs, Kaden, Valyn and their sister Adare are all scattered across the globe, each set upon a path by their father. Valyn is on a remote island training to become a Kettral, the Empire\u2019s special/elite forces. Imperial heir, Kaden is cloistered in a mountain abbey, training in the secrets of mental discipline to clear the mind and protect from attack, and seeking to understand the world from a different perspective. And only the eldest daughter, Adare who is suited to rule in all forms but her gender is the only one in Annur, having assumed the role of Minister of Finance. Although she cannot claim the throne, she intently seeks the murderer of her father.I think what I really loved most was the characters and their utter practicality rather than the plot, at least, in the first half of the book. They're royal children who spent their lives taking orders and raised to understand that being a royal comes with a lot of burden, expectations and complications. Expectation vs. reality:So, here's what I expected: An epic struggle for the throne (after all, the narrative starts out with the death of the emperor, so, you do the math), some sibling rivalry of sorts, a heavy dose of court and political intrigue and a boatload of conspiracies & plot twists surrounding the mystery behind the death of the emperor.Here's what I actually got: A kind of, coming of age story of the siblings - each going through their own struggles and inner conflicts as they try to deal and come to terms with their new reality.The fact that they are related didn\u2019t really play much of a part until the last few pages, and even then it felt somewhat contrived and forced. plot:All in all, the overarching plot was (or had the potential to be) a brilliant one \u2013 separate the three leads but have them be intrinsically linked and in danger, in a world that\u2019s both intriguing and interesting, with mythology and mystery. Sounds great right? Well yes, except for the issues that played a big part in hindering me from fully enjoying the story.And though I genuinely liked all three of the protagonists, I had a problem with each and every one of their perspective storylines.Issue #1:For starters, Adare was given only a fraction of the page time that her brothers received and I would\u2019ve loved to have seen more of her, particularly given the fact that among the three points of view, her story arc is arguably the one that holds the entire story together and is the most significant in relation to the coming of epic confrontation.It is also through her story that we get a greater sense of the world in which they inhabit, and where we discover that the plot that took down her and her brother's father was much greater and far more complicated. So, I fail to see the reason behind the decision in only giving her (the most important protagonist) less page time than, say, the one whose POV contributes nothing to the story until the very end (more on that below).  - The other problem I had with her was that she\u2019s supposed to be highly trained in the intricacies of politics but not much of it was evident in here and there were lots of inconsistencies in her actions. Her capability was often impeached by committing impetuous and, occasionally, stupid acts for, I'm presuming, no other reason than furthering Staveley\u2019s plot.Issue #2:For the first three quarters of the book, Kaden\u2019s storyline contributed little to nothing to the overarching plot and was simply unnecessary. Him getting tested on series of metal endurances by the elder monks or him simply running around with his buddy and getting beat up took up the bulk of his page time until that is, the very last few chapters when things finally started to get\u2026 wild. Issue #3:Out of the three, it was, of course, Valyn\u2019s storyline that I was continuously captivated by. However, not so fast there, because, his arc too isn\u2019t without its problems. Given his background and the length of time he\u2019d spent training in the elite forces, I expected so much more competency from\u00a0him. Furthermore, for someone who's also supposed to have been training for years as a team leader, there was not firmness nor toughness in him and his abilities in making executive decisions and leading a team or understanding teamwork, for that matter, left a lot to be desired. I still loved him despite his shortcomings and he was my favourite of the three. That being said, I will definitely continue on with the series and something tells me book #2 will knock my socks right off. It may not sound like I enjoyed it but that couldn't be further from the truth. Putting aside the unnecessary storyline, misshapen characters, and mediocre / inconsistent pacing, there's so much promise\u00a0and a huge potential in this series and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where the story will go next.\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917\u2917Got a feeling about this one, folks. \ud83d\ude0eSo, an Empire on a brink of collapse (I think?), treachery & deceit, a conspiracy, and siblings right in the centre.

One storyline dominates the others. I dreaded picking it up.- Author hates fat people and small eyes. It was a weird compulsive quirk! He also had a serious case of Disney Eyes in regard to \u201cgood\u201d characters.- Considering this is meant to be morally grey \u201cgrimdark\u201d fantasy there are clearly drawn lines between the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d guys.But what I really want to speak about is the representations of women in Blades particularly, and grimdark fantasy generally. I\u2019m also going to touch on how the book handles POC and LGBTQ characters. Bitches and WhoresI had so many problems with the way this book handled female characters. I\u2019m going to highlight a few examples. These aren\u2019t meant to be all- encompassing but they do provide textual evidence for my complaints. I want to be really clear that I\u2019m not just talking about characterization. I\u2019m talking about unconscious bias in the writing that routinely reveals itself in the way female characters relate to one another and the world, and in how they are internally described by POV characters. I\u2019m also talking about the amount of time they get on the page, and the way their character arcs are handled. These are separate issues from just \u201cthe story\u201d. It was these aspects of the writing that rankled me the most. Physical DescriptionsWomen are described by their breasts, physical attractiveness and Disney eyes. I wouldn\u2019t mind this if men were likewise described but the only men who get detailed descriptions are the \u201cfat, disgusting\u201d ones. In Valyn\u2019s first scene, surrounded by blood, gore and murder victims and in the middle of a training exercise Valyn spends time monologueing about how sexy Lin is. A few chapters later here is how Valyn describes Gwenna:\n\u201c\u2026 tempted by the bright green eyes and flaming red hair, by the supple, curvaceous body that she did her best to hide\u2026\u201d\nArgh! It is gratuitous and constant. Their personalities are also problematic. Girls are either dangerous like Gwenna with her terrible temper, or pathetic, like Rianne, or hopelessly inept like Lin and Adare. CharacterisationAdareAdare is one of the siblings but is only given about 6 chapters in the whole novel. She is constantly compared to others and her difficultly as a women in a man\u2019s world is obsessed over. The author sets up a hyper-sexist world. \n\u201cIt is no slight to you, Baxter Pane had argued, staring at her with those rheumy eyes of his, (eye obsession strikes again!) but women are not suited to the Ministry. They are too \u2026 fickle, too easily transported by their emotions.\u201d\nOk, I can understand that. But then he unconsciously characterised her in sexist way that confirms the bias. \nShe bit into a fingernail, then remembered her post, the hundreds watching, and returned the hand forcefully to her lap. Adare let the words trail off, retaking her seat with as much dignity as she could muster. Adare swallowed a curse. And here I am, allowing myself to be transported by my emotions.\nShe pretty much confirms all the criticisms and concerns people have about her and I'm not even sure the author realises this.LinI have a real issue with love interests who are sexually assaulted and then fridged to provide impetus for a male POV character. It is so disrespectful. Consider this scenario:Your brave hero is a warrior. She comes home to discover her loving husband has been raped and killed by her enemy. Furious and grief stricken she swears to punish the people who did this to her husband. And if she flirts with a few sexy young men along the way, well that doesn\u2019t diminish her cause, a girl has needs you know\u2026 Or how bout this one:Your James Bond stand- in is captured by the enemy. He is ruthlessly tortured and raped until he manages to escape. He swears vengeance. He will bring forth unholy terror on the people who hurt him. But to succeed he will need the help of a sexy female friend. Can he learn to love again? Can he trust her to touch his body with kindness after suffering with this isolating trauma for so long? Do you find these laughable? Possibly offensive? How would you have felt if the scenario in Blades had looked like this:\n\u201cI should be focusing on my bladework, and all I can think about is ripping the pants off this boy.\u201d Yurl had straddled Valyn, and instead of ending the struggle with a blow to the back of the neck, he was reaching down between his legs, trying to force his thighs apart as he thrashed and writhed.\u201d\nWould you be defending \u201crealism\u201d and the need to \u201cset the tone\u201d if the male protagonist was casually sexually assaulted while everyone- trainers, friends and fellow students- looked on, jeering when Yurl managed to wrap a hand around Valyn\u2019s limp dick or rub a few fingers along his crack?If you are uncomfortable with the image I\u2019m painting you need to ask yourself why you were ok with Staveley doing it to Lin. AmieAnd that brings me to another thing- the murdered prostitute Amie. When Lin criticizes another character for soliciting sex from a thirteen year old girl she is shamed. I'm including the lot so no one can argue I've ignored context.\nThe smile froze on Laith\u2019s face. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t my whore.\u201d\u201cOf course not. That\u2019s the nice thing about borrowed gear\u2014if it gets busted, it\u2019s no skin off your nose. If Amie had been yours, maybe you would have taken better care of her.\u201dValyn raised a hand to stop the words, but Laith stepped in close before he could speak. The flier\u2019s normal genial humor had burned off like the oil from the sputtering lamp.\u201cI don\u2019t know how I became the villain in this little tale,\u201d he said, eyes bright, voice soft, \u201cbut don\u2019t drag me into your guilt.\u201d\u201cMy guilt?\u201d Lin sputtered.\u201cOh, right,\u201d the flier shot back. \u201cI forgot. You only bought fruit from her. You never bought sex.\u201d He held up his palms in mock surrender. \u201cWhat\u2019d you pay her? A few copper flames? Enough to put a decent meal on her table? Enough so she could stop whoring?\u201dLin refused to respond, her face closed like a book.\u201cBefore you come pointing your finger at me, why don\u2019t you ask yourself what you did to make Amie\u2019s life any better,\u201d Laith demanded, eyes ablaze. Before Valyn could say anything to calm things down, the flier turned on his heel and stalked out.\nWhat is so strange about this is that the author seems to be making the suggestion that these two things are somehow equivalent. Like fucking a 13 year old shows the same degree of concern as purchasing produce from said 13 year old. Even if Lin had done nothing for Amie, she still was dead to rights to call out another character for paying for sex with the 13 year old. What most infuriated me about this was that Lin is left feeling guilty and no one ever questions Laith's position. Somehow he won that round? How???? It is accepted as fair and correct by all the characters and thus I can only conclude that it is also meant to be accepted as such by the reader. What the fuck? POC and LGBTQ characters\nBalendin looked like a savage straight out of the Hannan jungles. The feathers of seabirds hung among his long, dark braids, rings of ivory and iron pierced his ears, and blue ink snaked up his arms.\u201cAnd you wonder why everyone wants to string you bastards up,\u201d Gent grumbled. \u201cNo offense meant, Talal, but the whole thing is sick, filthy\u2026\u201d\nSo just a regular POC by fantasy standards then. He is \u201ctreacherous\u201d and \u201cfrightening\u201d. He is a filthy savage. He is also a magical savage who probably should have been lynched. The POV characters also make much of his background. He is from a colonized backwater, possibly one of the ones, \u201cpressing back against the \u2018foreign oppressors,\u2019 never mind that our oppression is what brings law courts and foreign trade, military protection and technological advancement\u201d. I mean... for fucks sake... how many times do we have to keep talking about how shitty it is to constantly frame fantasy stories in terms of colonization and marginalization? The three POV characters are obviously from an extremely privelegded background so I\u2019m not saying they should have better awareness of their own place in society but the novel never challenges these perspectives. These sort of comments are just thrown out into the narrative to swim around unchallenged. It makes it really hard to understand what Staveley\u2019s intentions are because in his own words he seems to think it is really easy to break tropes, and that he is more interested in exploring traditional frameworks. Consider his understanding of what fantasy tropes are:\n\u201cWithin the fantasy genre, however, breakage is actually pretty easy. See that nice wizard over there? He has a pointy hat and a white beard. He mutters querulously to himself. He\u2019s forgetful. He likes to read. He feeds nuts to an owl that perches on his shoulder. Now, let\u2019s watch as he pries the eyeball from the skull of an innocent child while that child\u2019s parents, whom our wizard has nailed (non-fatally) to a wall, watch in horror. Trope: broken. Honestly, I\u2019m always a little surprised when people describe my books as dark or violent.\u201d\nI mean what the hell? In that interview he seemed to be giving himself a pat on the back for his trope-breaking plot points. This suggests he isn\u2019t aware of the tropes he is reinforcing- which also means that even if he manages to redeem some aspects of his story in the next two books- it will likely be as accidental and unconscious as his reinforcement of them was in this novel. I\u2019m not even going to deal with Annick the magical unicorn lesbian. Suffice to say Staveley isn\u2019t providing any nuance to that aspect of characterization either.I can handle books that deal with difficult issues or exist in grimdark universes. But if you are going to explore issues of gender, sexual assault, and colonization at least do it with conscious fucking awareness. I was so angry reading this book. The issues were so overt that it would have been impossible for me to enjoy this even if the story had been more engaging/ better paced. This is the end of the review. The other stuff deals with grimdark fantasy more generally. Some criticisms I suspect this review will garner after my experience with a similar critique I did of Axe and the Throne:\n\u201cThis is grimdark, if you can\u2019t handle the genre don\u2019t read it.\u201d\n Fuck you. I\u2019m not being raped every other day in real life so why the fuck should every god-damn women in grimdark fantasy? If this is so fucking inevitable to the genre why does Best Served Cold manage to incorporate fully fleshed out female characters without constantly resorting to gendered violence. Why is Joe Abercrombie able to have a character who is a loving, single parent and a vicious torturer? Why is he able to have a female character that fucks and chucks a bloke and ends up better off for it? \n\u201cGrimdark is just being honest. This is reality.\u201d\nGrimdark is a subgenre that describes a particular the tone, style or setting of speculative fiction (especially fantasy) that is, depending on the definition used, markedly dystopian or amoral, or particularly violent or realistic.Here\u2019s the thing- grimdark does not have to equal sexism. N.K. Jemison\u2019s Broken Earth series (The Fifth Season) is dystopian, amoral, violent and realistic. However, shockingly, characters don\u2019t suffer because they are women or because they are POC. It is possible to write a grim dark novel and include harrowing, realistic scenes without resorting automatically to gendered and racial violence. When you say, \u201cwell this is realistic\u201d or \u201cthis is historically accurate\u201d you are saying that realistic worldbuilding requires the inclusion of certain specific inequalities in order to count as realistic \u2013 that a story cannot be honest, or characters believably human, if women and POC aren\u2019t oppressed or villainous. You are assuming that current expressions of bigotry, sexism and racism are universal truths. You are saying that there is no other possible reality that could be believable and then wonder why we get pissed off. Novels like Blades reinforce specific inequalities as inevitable, thereby further perpetuating those perspectives. The thing is grimdark doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the historical period it is trying to mimic or even current reality. Where is the male rape? Where are the soldiers dying, not in an epic battle, but from infected scratches? Where are the people going insane from syphilis, which hero has a dick full of pus as a result of his philandering? Why aren\u2019t the sexually active women pregnant? Why can so many characters read? I think you understand what I am getting at. The real problem is that grimdark as a genre has developed an \naesthetic\n that readers have become familiar with. As a result it \nfeels realistic and right\n. Hardboiled pulp noir mysteries felt realistic in the 1950\u2019s but we look back on them now and see them as a product of the author's time period, not as an accurate depiction of any sort of reality. The same is true for grimdark. It appeals to modern cynicism and we are so used to seeing gendered violence and oppressed POC that we think this is realistic. But it isn\u2019t. And I strenuously reject any claims to the contrary. \n\u201cThe real world is not the same as a fictional world, authors shouldn\u2019t have to be PC, fuck you and all the other SJW\u2019s out to ruin everything.\u201d\nFirstly, why are you so invested in seeing women raped and POC victimised in your fiction? I think this says more about you then me. Secondly, fiction has real- world consequences. Negative and positive. The Birth of a Nation inspired the formation of the second era of the Klu Klux Klan. 12 Years a Slave and other true accounts were essential in the political fight against slavery. \nFiction is not created or read in a vacuum.\n It is no coincidence that the MRA movement evolved out of the gaming community. There is a reason women read and write \u201cfeminist\u201d fiction. On one level or another we all acknowledge the very real and important ways stories permeate and shape our experience of the world. That said this is a subjective review. No one is preventing Staveley from publishing his work or you from reading it. I can say I don't like it and his fans can keep reading it. My dislike for something does not prevent you from enjoying it. I'm not lurking behind Staveley's writing desk with a butcher's knife telling him to write better fiction\u2026or else\u2026 \n\u201cNot every woman has to be a superhero who rescues kitties and knows karate.\u201d\nYep. I\u2019m well- aware of that, thanks. Women do not have to fall into a handful of archetypes. They do not have to be the hero every time or to always succeed. A Mary Sue is just as infuriating as a trophy vagina. What is necessary is that female characters are as multi-faceted and flawed as male characters. They need to have their own motivations and goals. If they suffer it should be part of their character arc not their love interests. Lin was not a real person. Every decision she made aimed at pushing Valyn along his path to character growth. Consider that in one scene she ruthlessly kills a girl to teach Valyn the importance of recognizing the greater good. A few scenes later she teaches him the importance of compassion. Lin loses her temper, which leads him to play the hero and also teaches him the lesson that he should not let his emotions rule him. It also helps inspire sympathy in the reader for Valyn and increases our desire to see him succeed over the assholes. I don\u2019t think it is too much to ask of authors that they ensure their female characters are fully-fleshed out. \n\u201cLater in the series xyz character does xyz which proves it\u2019s not sexist at all.\u201d\nFirstly, the other books don\u2019t matter because I\u2019m reviewing this book. Secondly, from some of the synopsis\u2019 I\u2019ve read of the other books I\u2019m almost certain I would have similar complaints. Thirdly, in terms of literary merit, I found the book boring and have no interest in reading the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "Reread January 2015 Dropped 1 star from 5 to 4 Last year was a big fantasy year for me and my well of experience is bigger now. I still enjoyed this book, it well written with an engaging story, but not quite as much the second time through and I blame my love for Brandon Sanderson's high fantasy for this. There is also Patrick Rothfuss and Joe Abercrombie to blame a little but mostly Sanderson. See I found Sanderson, Rothfuss and Abercrombie books not long after reading The Emperor's Blades this year and they have made my fantasy well much deeper and I expect a little more. The problem I have is with the twist/big reveal toward the end. It is still a good twist I didn't see it coming and was really surprised....but that is part of the problem. The great thing about a Sanderson book is that when the twist happens and it always happens I can look back and see the clues leading to it. I can see how he was the magician who presented me droppings to lead me to one train of thought and then POW hit me with something else entirely. I have grown to love that bait and switch and that is what makes a good twist a Great twist. There isn't quite that subtle layer in the Emperor's Blade. There is the big reveal but even on the reread there really aren't any clues that I should have seen. It all still makes a lot of sense and I really liked it but it didn't have that extra umph at the very end.This was Stavely's debut novel so I'm really excited to see what he follows up with and how much he has grown as a writer. Original review January 2014It is the hardest thing to write a review for a book you absolutely love. There is no way that I can get across how marveled by this story I am. The Emperor\u2019s Blades is probably the best new High Fantasy book of the year. Okay so it\u2019s only January but I\u2019m just going to say that the bar has been set extremely high and I unless George RR Martin\u2019s Winds of Winter the 6th book of the A Song of Ice and Fire makes it out this year (highly unlikely) then Brian Staveley\u2019s debut novel might hold this spot in my head and heart all year. I couldn\u2019t believe that this is a debut novel, I\u2019m floored by the depth of the story and this is just the beginning. Brian Staveley will, in all probability, just improve as time goes on and I can\u2019t wait to read anything else he writes.Told from the perspective of the Emperor\u2019s three children Kaden, Valyn and Adare so many different facets of the world were shown to the reader. Instead of telling us that Valyn is a remarkable soldier, like many other fantasy authors do, we are shown the hell of the Kettral training and fully believe after reading those pages that Valyn is a strong warrior. The same goes for Kaden, sent to a monastery for training to become Emperor. His trials are extremely difficult and he is not a pampered prince, I believed that through the years spent there he was able to accomplish the training he needed to be Emperor. There are plots a foot against the empire and all three children of the Emperor, while facing different challenges, play an equally important role in the story. There are ancient enemies from the past, epic battles, trials and tribulations and each one has tempered each of the Emperor\u2019s children into a honed blade against the enemies that are trying to take over the Empire and who murdered the Emperor. Every important facet of the world is explored and fleshed out. There was almost always something of importance happening.There is some set up to this world and so I would say the first 20% runs a little slower than the rest of the story but after that between mysteries and events unfolding I couldn\u2019t tear myself away from the story. No character is safe, there are surprises around every corner, some I guessed most I did not. The author gives plenty of leads, but then the result of the lead was often different and more complex than I originally thought. The intricacy of the story is up there with Tolkien and George RR Martin weaving multiple story lines and plots into a larger grander scheme, but with a prose that is natural, beautiful and easy to read. Every part of the story seemed necessary all of the characters real. Not one character was perfect but all flawed and human. Staveley has created a unique world and really brought it to life in the pages of this story. The only thing I can even complain about is the fact that I started this before the next book was out, I wanted to jump into the next book right away.As a female lover of fantasy the other thing I really liked about The Emperor\u2019s Blades is how many strong female characters there are. Even though the majority of the book is told from Kaden and Valyn\u2019s perspectives some of the strongest characters were female. They made difficult decisions and just because a woman was a warrior didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t have emotions and complexity. He allowed his female characters to be strong without making them into a bitch, they come across as independent, not needing to be saved by a man or anyone else. I appreciate the intricacy that Mr. Staveley put into every one of them.Brian Staveley has a new fan in me. If you only read one Fantasy book this year, this should be it. I look forward to reading it again before the next in the series comes out.Jan 18,2014 Brain Stavelley has set the bar high for this series. The way everything in the story blended together, the reveals I didn't see coming (and there were some slap me in the face doozies), the feelings the book envoked, the intricate world created will be hard to match or beat.I think Mr. Stevelley has the potential to be just as renowned has Tolkien or George R.R.

We start the book with the death of an emperor\u2014as auspicious a premise as there ever was\u2014but until the final quarter, nothing of importance happens. It\u2019s quite shocking actually: a book that is going to be published could stand to lose its first 300 pages. All that happens in those 300 pages is an extended montage scene. The two princes\u2014one training to be an elite soldier, the other serving as a monastic acolyte\u2014get into various unimportant scrapes that are described in painstaking detail. (Literally \u2018painstaking\u2019: the pain of these unnecessary details is comparable to the pain of impalement by a stake.) Now I can never resist a good montage scene. Upbeat music coupled with characters getting ready to chase their goals is a perfect combination. But after a while I was hoping for, then praying for, then sacrificing cows at a homemade altar for a conflict to maybe kinda sorta sometime soon appear. Please Zeus?As I waited very patiently, I was subjected to simplistic and forced dialogue that merely served to push the plot along. I also had to suffer dumb characters. Get ready to scoff and eyeroll when a character neglects to notice a big fat whopping clue slapping him on the side of his face! It happens quite a lot, especially with soldier prince. It\u2019s even worse because the story is so emotionally simplistic, it is impossible to connect with the characters. But what bothered me most about this novel was its treatment of female characters. Now this rant does not entirely belong to The Emperor\u2019s Blades. Rather it is the result of hundreds of fantasy books, normally written by male authors, committing the same error. There are three POV characters in this novel, but I\u2019ve only mentioned the two princes. That\u2019s because the princess\u2019s chapters are very few. What\u2019s worse, in each of her chapters we are constantly reminded that this girl cannot be emperor, that she has no role in this man\u2019s fantasy world. I don\u2019t like \u201cstrong\u201d female characters who are constantly told that they\u2019re a rarity, that sexism does not want them where they currently have fought to be. Because honestly this just reinforces the idea that it is unnatural for women to be in positions of power. It suggests, quite unconsciously but regardless, that ambitious and successful women are an aberration. Give me a fantasy novel where men and women are equal and absolutely nothing has to be said about it because it\u2019s normal! Despite all these gripes, The Emperor\u2019s Blades is a mildly entertaining novel that will be appreciated by those who like their fantasy more popcorny and less meaty. Do know that this is a series beginner and there is absolutely zero resolution here. Will I be back for book two? Possibly, since the mythology of this world seems interesting and I didn\u2019t learn enough about it for my taste (instead I was treated to another knife fight or something). But I\u2019m going to read reviews carefully before coming back for more to make sure that all of the significant action isn\u2019t stuffed into the final 100 pages."}, {"userName": "Bookwraiths", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14716035-bookwraiths", "userReview": "Originally reviewed at Bookwraiths.After reading fantasy for most of my life, I\u2019ve seen more than a few \n\u201cNext Big Thing\u201d\n come along. Some of those hyped novels and series have lived up to the tile, but more than a few have crumbled under the expectations. At least, in my eyes they did. And so when I kept seeing people rave about Brian Staveley\u2019s The Emperor\u2019s Blades, I was a bit skeptical, fearing another letdown if I let myself get sucked into the frenzy. Well, after finally breaking down and reading it, I now realize all that waiting and doubting was a huge mistake, because this is the real deal in epic fantasy; the Next Big Thing in the genre; the series I can see myself eagerly following for years to come!The Emperor\u2019s Blades follows along behind three of the Emperor\u2019s children: Kaden (the heir), Valyn (the soldier), and Adare (the politician). Each chapters shining the spotlight on one or the other in turn, highlighting their unique struggles, as they are on the edge of maturity yet still trapped in their childhood roles. Sure, there is a bit of resentment of their duties and future roles as their father\u2019s heirs, but their stories are definitely not young adult angst-fests or full-fledged \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d tales, but rather a situation where the protagonists just happen to be young adults.As the heir, one would expect Kaden\u2019s story to be centered on court life and political machinations, but Mr. Staveley sidesteps that tired narrative device \u2013 instead placing the future Emperor in a monastery on the fringes of civilization. His thoughts and concerns more on news from the outside world and not being beaten by his master for yet another failure in his monastic training than royal ambitions.Valyn, on the other hand, leads an exciting life as a \u201cspecial forces\u201d-type warrior. His training and the infighting of his fellow cadets turns ugly early and often, as he attempts to become one of the most feared soldiers in the world. If there is truly a \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d narrative in the book, I\u2019d point at Valyn\u2019s chapters, because there is a love interest, tough choices, and some emotional turmoil from an unexpected lose; all of which means Valyn displays more angst than his siblings.The final \u201cBlade\u201d in this trio is Adare. This tough, intelligent young woman is knee-deep in political turmoil. As the only child of the Emperor still in the capital, she is quickly engulfed by an upheaval in the government, using her position as a member of the royal cabinet to not only weather the storm but dish out her own punishment to those who have done her wrong. This embroils her in an ugly and very compelling showdown with a powerful religious leader and an alliance with a seemingly friendly politician.All in all, every one of these siblings is a likable, strong, intelligent, and interesting character; each well-rounded, complex and fully capable of carrying their part of the story. Valyn definitely gets more page time, followed closely by Kaden, but even Adare, in her limited appearances, is very interesting, making a reader long for more time to spend tagging along behind her. So, while many times multiple points of view are distracting in an epic fantasy or have interesting and uninteresting parts, all three of these hold their own, making the story a pleasure to read from beginning to end.Naturally, the other character in any epic fantasy is the world building, and Brian Staveley unveils a vibrant, living, and breathing fantasy wonderland in this book. Asian-tinged with sizable dollops of magic, the Annurain world is slowly revealed through the organic teachings of the older characters in the narrative, not through massive info dumps or long \u201cCouncil of Elrond\u201d like dialogue. And while the depth and breadth of the history and lore are substantial and the magic palpable, Mr. Staveley does a wonderful job of keeping it all just beyond reach, hinting at even more amazing things waiting right around the corner, promising to let you in on the next big secret if you merely stay the course and follow along behind these three characters, who are themselves slowly untangling the mysteries which you yourself long to know.As for the villains, they are numerous and unexpected. No all powerful and completely obvious Sauron-like caricatures here. Nope, each of our young stars deal with their own very different enemies. Whether that be arrogant fellow cadets for Valyn or mysterious creatures for Kaden or powerful high priests for Adare, Mr. Staveley crafts each one differently, shading them in unique ways, so that our Blades are never confronted with the same situation as their sibling a few chapters before. And when the conclusion to the novel finally rolls around, the unveiling of exactly who and what the real villains are and what they are doing might just surprise you.Like I said, this is a book I really fell in love with. Once I became engrossed in the story, I could not stop reading. The characters, the world, the grittiness, and the fast-paced plots held my attention, causing me to stop looking at the clock as I desperately mined this narrative for the answers to all the questions my mind kept creating. Nope, I didn\u2019t get on this bandwagon at the beginning, but now I intend to ride it as far as Mr. Staveley will take me, because Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne is the Next Big Thing out there in my opinion, one which has room for a few more fans if you\u2019d like to jump on next to me and take a fantastic ride.I received this book for free from Tor Books in return for a fair and unbiased review.

Everything about the prologue in this book appealed to me. It carried a sense of weight and reality. The writing was compelling and mysterious. And it introduced a conflict that seemed so new and original and cool. I was thoroughly convinced of this book's merit by the time I got to the end of the prologue.And then I got to chapter one, and never heard anything about the contents of the prologue until I was more than halfway through the book. The majority of the book had absolutely nothing to do with the conflict that the prologue introduces. By the time I got to the end of the book I started to understand why the author did this, but it was still frustrating, because I got all excited about a story I would never actually get to read.It took me a little while to get into it because of that, but once this book got going, it was really quite good. The worldbuilding and story, in particular, I found to be especially unique. The author took concepts that we are all relatively familiar with and used them in a way that added a unique spin onto these familiar ideas. It's light on the magic content, and this was both a good and a bad thing. Good, because I don't think that the story required a lot of magic content to keep it interesting. Bad, because the magic that *is* in the book I felt could have been better explained, especially regarding the people they call \"Leaches\". The story is told from the perspective of three siblings - Kaden, Valyn, and Adare. It was the characters that kept me from giving this more than four stars. I found them all to be more than a little bland, and just not very interesting. It felt like they all lacked any real personality, and especially after finishing Wrath and The Faithful and the Fallen, I had a really hard time relating to any of the characters in this book. Valyn was BY FAR the most interesting character in the book, but even his character didn't really draw me in until more than halfway through the book. Kaden's *story* kept me interested, but there was literally nothing interesting about him as a person. Neither of them were bad characters, I just really wasn't personally drawn to them.And then there was Adare, who was about as painfully, annoyingly stupid as any character you could read about. She didn't get a lot of airtime in this book, and thank God for that, because I don't think I could have handled more of her than I got.However, in spite of that, the overarching story in the book was seriously excellent, and it's the story and plot of this book that I think sets it apart from other fantasy series in the market today. It felt fresh. We're presented with totally original ideas, combined with familiar elements, that gave this book a really new feeling. So much of today's fantasy feels recycled, but Stavely really did something unique with the story in this book, and I'll definitely be finishing this series because of that.Overall, if you're looking for something different, I really recommend checking this series out. Keep in mind that you might not fall in love with the characters, but if you can get into the story that's being told, it will be well worth your time. Happy reading =].

In fact, many of the review sites that I respect the most posited that this book was highly overrated, and they had no idea why Tor had pushed the book so hard. So, I went into this book thinking that it would be an enjoyable read, but nothing too special. Perhaps because of this bias it took me a few chapters to get into the rhythm of the novel, but once I did I was blown away. This is a wonderful debut novel and the start to a new series that I am sure I will read over and over again. Once I became engrossed in this book, I found it almost impossible to put down. I love the characters, I love the world, and I love the fast paced and exciting plot. This is one of those novels that I have a hard time finding anything to criticize.

Highly, highly recommended.1/6/2014 Edit: This book comes out next week (I'm ridiculously excited to get my hardcover of it) and I read this interesting blog by Brian Staveley about the inspiration for the Kettral training scenes hereThere\u2019s a scene near the middle of The Emperor\u2019s Blades in which a class of Kettral cadets, ultra-elite warriors who fly massive hawks into battle, are undergoing their final test: Hull\u2019s Trial. People who have read the book ask about this scene a lot, and about Kettral training more generally. They want to know if I\u2019ve served in the military \u2013 I haven\u2019t \u2013 and then they want to know where in the hell all the training material comes from. The answer (aside from lots and lots of reading about military training) is adventure racing.12/24/2013 Edit:I've just found the map of Annur on Brian Staveley's website! I was hoping to have one of these. Click on the map for a bigger picture\nReview: Best fantasy book I've read in a long time, quite possibly ever.I requested this book without even reading the book-blurb because a friend (Thank You Cory!!) told me, while still in the middle of reading it, that it was the best fantasy book she'd read in a long time. Fantasy is my home in genre novels, I come back to it time and time again because it's comfortable, exciting, interesting, detailed and emotional. So I started The Emperor's Blades with incredibly high expectations and excitement.I was absolutely and thoroughly Blown.Away. This book is amazing. I highlighted dozens of moments throughout this book, was on the edge of my seat for most of it, and was absolutely enthralled the entire journey.The intricate, sweeping story that follows the Malkeenian royal line - two brothers and a sister maneuvering between, around and through plots to take the Unhewn Throne from them - is full of intrigue and twists, danger and valor, despair and determination. I can't even do this justice, but I will say it's only the second book to surprise me so completely and throw twists at me I didn't even see coming. After I spent a good portion of the book detailing theories in my head, only to be wrong most of the time, the final twist absolutely blew my mind.Kaden, Valyn, and Adare are some of my favorite characters - I was utterly and completely on their side from the very first moments we met each of them. Though I admit Valyn, the warrior, is my favorite, I love all three of them. As I was reading I was eager to see them succeed, to beat the insurmountable odds stacked against them, and terrified that they wouldn't. They aren't infalliable. They aren't perfect. They are, however, absolutely loyal, strong, intelligent, and full of determination. Thank goodness, because this war is going to test the depths of their resolve. Additionally, there are more than a few other characters that I'm dying to know more about. Those for, and against, the emperor both.I can't end this review without speaking of the writing itself in The Emperor's Blades. I primarily read for characters, then world, then plot. Prose is important, the way the words are strung together can make or break a story, but it's often the last thing I consider when I decide how much I like a story or not. And if the story here hadn't been so utterly fantastic, if the characters hadn't been so completely intriguing, the world so fascinating - then the words that formed it wouldn't have delighted me so much. But Brian Staveley did something amazing here. He weaved words together in beautiful sentences, gorgeous paragraphs, and painted me a picture that I couldn't look away from. As engrossed as I was in the story, as much as I had to know what was going to happen next, I still stopped and had to re-read a section that was so arresting, so gorgeous, that I couldn't go on without appreciating it for a second, or third, time.Part of the journey is complete in The Emperor's Blades, but it's clear there's a lot left to be told. And I, for one, couldn't be happier.Review also available on my blog and booklikes"}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "This was a fairly standard fantasy story. It was decent without being anything special. The Emperor has just been assassinated and this book follows the story of his three children as they seek to avoid the same fate. All three of the siblings are in different locations. The eldest, Adare, remained at court with her father and learned the ways of government. The youngest sibling, Kaden, is the heir to the throne and is training in a far flung monastery. The middle sibling, Valyn, is training to be a warrior with the legendary Kettral. All three were likable enough characters. I liked Valyn's story the most. The Kettral training was interesting and the secondary characters were the most developed. Kaden's story was fairly interesting. Mainly because it eventually lead to us learning who was behind the plot to kill the Imperial family. The mythical, and not human, Csestriim. Adare seemed likable enough. We spent the least amount of time with her. She was focused on discovering who assassinated her father. Despite having a few flaws this book recovered from a slow start to become a fun read. The Csestriim were suitably creepy and villainous, and the various hints of magic we glimpsed were pretty cool.Rating: 4 stars. I'm being kind as the ending was quite good.Audio Note: Simon Vance is a competent narrator, but he will never be a favorite of mine."}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295220-alexa", "userReview": "Buddy read with Athena, Lee and Michael.I HATE being the only one that doesn't like a book everyone loves.But I'm not going to lie: I didn't like this book. In the strict sense of goodreads rating I should have given it 1 single lonely star, I'm giving it that second one because the last 15% of the book was actually pretty good. So, let's tally what I thought were this book's sins: BOOK SIN #1. So from the blurb we know that\"Kaden, the heir to the Unhewn Throne, has spent eight years sequestered in a remote mountain monastery, learning the enigmatic discipline of monks devoted to the Blank God.\"We learn that this is really REALLY important for the heir to know, which prompts the interesting question: what happens if Kaden dies? Because you know, accidents do happen. People die all the time. Does Valyn suddenly needs to go spend 8 years learning this too? Wouldn't it have been easier to just send both of them to learn the very important thing? BOOK SIN #2 As stated Kaden has been learning stuff for eight years. Well... \"learning\", he's been doing a lot of random crap that are supposed to be important in the end. Can you say Karate Kid? Wax on, wax off, wax on... The problem is, Kaden doesn't seem to have learned ANYTHING AT ALL. For Hull's sake it's been 8 freaking years. Did all the lessons just go in one ear and out the other? The guy acts like an idiot for 85% of the book!BOOK SIN #3 Actually I think stupidity runs in the family. Valyn has been training for the same amount of time with the super awesome black ops elite force. Yet he seems always to be on the verge of dying, doesn't see the OBVIOUS clues around the \"mystery\" and is a TERRIBLE team leader. BOOK SIN #4 Also, why the training they endure has to be so violent?! I'm not sure about this idea that beating your apprentice bloody is actually going to make him learn better. It definitely didn't work with these two.BOOK SIN #5 The only smart one in the family is the daughter. Hurray! Of course, she only gets like 5 chapters out of the 50 in the book.BOOK SIN #6 The depiction of the other two important female characters in the book is terrible. \n\"She didn't look like a flint-hearted killer. At first glance, she actually looked more like a farmer's daughter than a soldier\"\nSo, exactly what does a soldier woman looks like? BOOK SIN #7 Valyn is being thrown off a ship by his most hated antagonist, and we get this gem: \n\"the blond youth grinned down at him...\"\nFirst, I'm tired of the repetitive descriptions. How many times are you going to tell me Yurl is blond? I got it the first 10000 times. Second, seriously? \"The blond youth grinned down at him\"? This is a person Valyn hates! The \"blond youth\"? More like \"The fucking bastard!\" Get your fucking adjectives right!BOOK SIN #8 Obvious romance plot going wrong is obvious.BOOK SIN #9 If the Kettral have to fight in groups, wouldn't it have been a good idea to include some group training in all those years? These guys are all a bunch of lone wolfs. Also, for an elite force they seem TERRIBLE at knowing stuff. Shouldn't they be very good at espionage and information?BOOK SIN #10 WHY DIDN'T THIS BOOK DELIVER ON THE AWESOME PROLOGUE!!To be honest there was one thing I loved from the book. It has awesome curses, swearwords and phrases. :DAlso, the worlbuilding seems nice, if overly convoluted at times, and the writing is really good. Will I read the second one? Maaaaaybe. If someone promises me Adare gets more page time.Would I recommend this? Actually yes. Give it a try.

It surprised me a lot because I did not expect to fall for this book. Initially, I gave this book 5 stars but after my January 2015 re-read, I'm dropping a star because well, to be honest, certain parts bored me a little. The story is adventurous and extremely twisty. You cannot trust anyone. The world building was complex and so were the characters. I find it hard to believe that this was Staveley's debut novel because the writing style, the intricate world we're introduced to, the highly complex characters, et cetera seems like something an author whose had a lot of practice in writing high fantasy novels would provide. So, excellent work, Mr.Staveley! Just excellent!\n\u201cThere\u2019s no blade as keen as surprise.\u201d\nThe story follows the life of the Emperor's three children. Kaden is sent to the monastery to train to be the next Emperor, Valyn is training to be a Kettral soldier and Adare is completely into politics. The story is told from their perspectives and it is definitely very enjoyable to switch between their stories. However, at times, I was a little bored by the pacing of this book. It would eventually pick up and I would slowly get sucked in by the numerous ploys the Empire faces and the several complications the main characters have to undergo.The story is not extremely vast and confusing and it focuses mainly on the Emperor's three children. It has a point, you know. It does not introduce a lot of concepts, just dumping it on the reader and then going back to where we left off in the beginning. It was executed very neatly with three goals in mind, one for each of the Emperor's children. I personally loved Adare's point of view because she was like a breath of fresh air. She was strong and bold and never weak like most of the female characters in high fantasy novels are portrayed as. Even though her appearance in this novel is not as much as I would have wanted to, I loved reading her views. I also immensely enjoyed Kaden's point of view because his training in the monastery was interesting! The concepts the Shin taught were very, very intriguing. Valyn's point of view was interesting and fun as well but I found myself dozing off at times.This book can sit right next to Game of Thrones on your shelf because it's as amazing as that! Fantasy readers out there would immensely enjoy this epic novel of adventure. To find out if this is going to be your next read or not let me direct you through a set of questions.Are you a high fantasy lover?Do you like complex world building?Do you like alternating point of views?Do you like rich writing?Do you like flawed yet amazing characters? Are you a fan of Game of thrones and Tolkien's works?If the answers are a resounding 'Yes', then you know what to do. If some of them are a sad 'No', well, I still suggest you pick this book up when you're in the mood for some fantasy."}, {"userName": "Will M.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20408288-will-m", "userReview": "When the goodreads choice award nominees were finally presented last Nov.3, I checked out the Fantasy section right away. I realized then that I haven't read a single Fantasy novel that was published in 2014. I decided to read at least 2, and The Emperor's Blade caught my attention the most. It had an interesting blurb and I was really expecting to love this. I even saw that most of my friends rated this 5 stars. All I want to ask now is, why?I really didn't like this novel as a whole. The writing was tedious and the plot could've been executed better. Let me rephrase that, with better characters, the plot would've been better. The plot was quite simple, but with simplicity should come competent execution. If you're going to give us something we might've read about before, make sure to add in some elements that would be noteworthy.Valyn, Kaden and Adare are the main characters of the novel. Evidently, Valyn had the most chapters of the three. That being said, his story should've been the most interesting. The thing is, his story was boring as hell. It was dragging and full of nonsense. At first I really liked what was happening to him, but as the novel progressed, boredom prevailed. Kaden should've been the star of the novel. His story was the most interesting of the three. All of the attention was given to Valyn, and that for me was the reason why I didn't like this novel. Kaden being the right heir to the throne, why wouldn't the readers want to know more of him instead of Valyn? I'm really hoping the next book wouldn't be about Valyn anymore. Adare was really interesting too. Her story was even more interesting than Valyn, and she only had a few chapters. Her parts showed the politics side of the novel. Her chapters gave me a feeling of reading about Greek/Roman mythology, and she was Athena with the wisdom and all. Not much action but still better than Valyn.Did I hate this novel?Almost. Am I planning on reading the sequel?I guess so. The ending was good anyway. Am I voting for this? Sorry, but no.This is one of the few novels wherein everybody loved it, and I didn't. I can pair this with The Name of The Wind as some of the most disappointing Fantasy novels I've read.

I think I have had the greatest luck in choosing books this new year! I feel lucky:) How can I not? The book I read just before this one was the first book of the Seven Realms series by Cinda Williams Chima and I was enchanted, now I read this one and I am in love all over again with what I consider to be the King of all genres, Fantasy!!! (In my opinion, the Queen is Historical Romance, but this is just me:):):) So, I had never heard of this author before, but the gorgeous cover sold me immediately, as well as the glowing reviews my GR friends gave this series. I was a bit slow to worm to the story, but in the moment we met the monks and their teachings, I was hooked!!! The Emperor of the land has been assassinated and we are introduced to his three children, who happen to be young adults, separated 8 years ago and all devoted into training supposed to help them with their future responsibilities. We get to meet Valyn, training for the empire\u2019s Special Forces and having to deal with some co-cadets who like to show him he is not special, despite of his high birth. He learns of the death of his father and makes it his mission to discover what is going on. But first, he has to get through the training and the final test, which could prove deadly even for the best of them. The second sibling we meet, and he happens to have become my favorite, is the hair to the throne, young Kaden. I lovingly nicknamed him goat boy, because most of the time he is running in the heals of a mountain at the end of civilization, where he tends to and often looses goats (or sheep, honestly, I have not a clue) and has all together been treated like a village lad by the Blank God\u2019s disciple monks. This is highly unusual, since when he was sent to the monastery, his father had told him that the monks are going to teach him something imperative to being a ruler and only they have the know-how to do it. He had expected education, but all they had given him were domestic chores, fixing roofs, hanging out with other accalates, even more distant from court life than him, and never-ending climes and runs around the mountains, mostly after escaped animals:) When it came to being prepared for court, politics and ruling, Kaden was anything but! However, he gets a new instructor, who despite beating him close to death, seems to be trying to brake not only his body, but his mind as well... The third, although oldest of the siblings, is the Emperor\u2019s daughter, Minister Adare. Out of the three, she is best suited, trained and adapt for the throne, but she is a woman, and in this patriarchal society, she is blatantly overlooked. But she is smart, her father has honed her in the machinations of the aristocracy and she is going to do anything in her power to avenge his death. The action builds up slowly, the tension grows with every page, and I could not put it down, returning to the book every free moment I had free. Having the 3 POV's made the book feel a bit more textured than the standard classical Fantasy, so it had a fresher, newer feel to it. The writing was flawless, the characters flashed out, and there was plenty of world building and atmospherics. The secondary characters, particularly the female cadets, were wonderful and made the book even better. I loved every moment of it! Well, with all that love, why only 4.25 stars??? Because, despite being very aware of how much space authors have to give the characters of long series to grow, the two boys drove me insane at times with their less than stellar mind power!!! I know, I know, whatever happened to me claiming not to lower ratings because of artistic/author choices, since the books are their babies and they know what they are doing... It is not that I do not accept the \"I started off a simple lad and grew to be a hero\" model, the opposite - one of my always favorites. But I feel the same when I read the new testament and see the apostles asking questions from Jesus that a 4 year old would have the answers to - I feel like the reader's intelligence is being insulted, not only that of the characters... Young man should not always equal a borderline idiot, that is all I am saying:) Also, the couple of bad guys which we get to deal with, a bit shallow, not enough debt, but still good and making a point:) I am very happy to have discovered this series and will forever have this author on my radar now:)Thanks to all my buddy readers at BB&B and wish all of you happy reading!!!"}, {"userName": "Lindsey Rey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5436213-lindsey-rey", "userReview": "[4.5 Stars]That was great!

I've been waiting to find my next great fantasy love, and this is most definitely it. I'm so excited for the rest of this series!If I had to describe it in terms of other series in the genre, I'd call The Emperor's Blades a cross between A Song of Ice and Fire and Tamora Pierce's The Lioness Quartet (and to a lesser extent Protector of the Small) with a healthy dash of Harry Potter thrown in for good measure. Much like Game of Thrones and The Lioness Quartet, the book is set in an ancient, vaguely medieval kingdom with a long and storied history. There's courtly intrigue, possibly extinct or apocryphal race/races that existed before men, some mysterious ancient gods, and magic that no one really understands. (In Emperor's Blades, those who wield magic are not only feared, they are actively persecuted.) There's a bit of an Iron Throne knock off (the Unhewn Throne), and a fair amount of political maneuvering that's been hinted at in book one, and is sure to be more fully explored in the sequels. The book is told from the point of view of the three teenage children of the emperor, whose assassination sets the plot in motion. The siblings have been separated for the past eight years, and are scattered across the vast empire. Valyn is preparing to join the Kettral, an elite army unit who fly across the empire on giant birds (it's cooler than it sounds). His brother Kaden, the heir to the throne, is training at an isolated mountain monastery, though no one will tell him how the monks' austere lifestyle is meant to prepare him to one day sit in his father's throne. (It's a doozy of a reveal, and one of Staveley's most original and unexpected ideas--the Kaden plot is what really makes this book sing, IMHO.) Their sister Adare has remained at home in the capital, learning the ins and outs of governance directly from her father. Upon his untimely death, she is named minister of finance in his will, but there was more that he had to teach her. (!!!) There are only a few Adare chapters, which works well because her plot is a bit Kings Landing-ish. The brothers' sections also include some common tropes, but they are well executed. Valyn assembles a somewhat rag-tag band of Kettral that, despite initially being a total disaster, show signs of becoming a crack team by the novel's end. Both brothers have tough but well-meaning mentors. Kaden is basically getting brutal Occulmancy lessons for half the novel, and much like Harry, he isn't informed of their true importance for quite awhile. Valyn's scenes are the most Harry Potter-like in general (although the whole training-to-become-a-warrior-of-the-realm thing is very Lioness Quartet). He's essentially taking classes, during which he and his best friend are often pitted against a Draco Malfoy-esque enemy with a Crabbe-and-Goyle crony (though that relationship is somewhat subverted in the end). He also has one instructor who appears to resent his princely-status to a Snape-like degree. Valyn and his buddies spend much of their free time trying to solve mysteries of an increasingly-apparent sinister nature without the help of adults. They also basically take their OWLs/NEWTs to become full-fledged members of the Kettral in what will make a great montage scene when this inevitably becomes a movie.The parallels to existing fantasy works are there, but the world that Staveley has created still feels fresh and original. For a first time author, he's done a remarkable job of introducing a wide cast of characters and a detailed mythos without relying on dragging exposition or red shirt placeholders. The plot here moves fast, and you won't want to put the book down. Basically, it's a total page-turner. The characters are also remarkably well-written. All three of the main characters are quite down to earth and easy to relate to considering they are the children of an emperor. Adare is a bit more haughty than the brothers, since she hasn't been yelled at by demanding instructors on a daily basis for eight years, but even she is pretty chill. The secondary characters each have fairly distinct personalities, and for those who are less fleshed out, you still get the sense that the author has bigger plans for them.By the novel's end there have been a couple of major revelations (new! enemies!), and all three of the main characters have been severely tested. For better or for worse, Adare, Kaden and Valyn each undergo significant character development, and are not the same people we met at the beginning of the novel. All in all, the conclusion does tie up the plot of book one in a satisfying manner, but still does a great job at setting up a sequel (which, let's face it, is a prerequisite of the genre these days, right?).In conclusion, everyone is going to be reading this, or I will eat my hat. I haven't been this excited by a new series without reading advanced praise for it since I pulled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone off the bottom shelf at a Scholastic book fair in 1998. This is 100% the real deal. Must. Read.

This book is not what I expected. Not knowing anything about the book, and just judging from the cover and the friends I knew who had read the book I expected this to more epic fantasy like Brent Weeks or Sanderson, but was I wrong. This was in part maybe because Epic Fantasy all has to be huge door stoppers, which this one is certainly not. This is more of a blend of different genres that turned out to more of a murder mystery than anything else with military fantasy as the backdrop with a dash of religion. It is about murder of the emperor, and how that affects his 3 children, two boys and one girl spread across the world as they deal with their own problems and difficulties. One trying to figure out his own murders, while the others train and get ready for Hull's Trial. This was nothing really innovative, but it was a nice fun read that kept my attention all the way through that had just the right amount of detail and pacing. What I really did not expect was the book ending on a cliffhanger not really resolving the murder mystery, which was kind of expected since this is book 1 of a trilogy.

I'm assuming you have read the synopsis. The Emperor is assassinated. His three children are separated. The the heir to the thrown is away living and being trained by a monastery of hard ascetic monks. The second son is away far from both the capitol and his older brother training to become a super elite soldier. The older sister lives at the capitol with her parents learning about taxes, food distribution, dealing with the day to day of the empire. And also dealing with the idea that even if she's the oldest a woman can't rule....The split point of view is not at all an unusual way to write a novel. It can be a tricky approach. I just finished a novel that (in my opinion) flubbed that way of writing a book badly. here however it works and it works well. I was interested in each and every one of them. the story grows naturally. The characters react as they most likely would react. That can of course be frustrating at time...as people are frustrating.I can recommend this one. I think most who like fantasy will be drawn into it. It's neither wholly plot driven nor character driven but a good balance of both. As I said recommended, enjoy."}, {"userName": "Natalie Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "userReview": "[And fuck her death. Fuck the kiss that happened beforehand, so Valyn can mourn over his lost love as the camera pans artfully over his tears like every overblown male-driven Hollywood action blockbuster. I am so bleeding tired of women dying for a man's character growth. To Ha Lin's credit, she tries to impart this on Valryn's thick skull, that she's not his property and that she's her own person, but it's dampened by her death. Her character ends up being defined by what she can do for Valyn's journey. (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "The circle is closing. The stakes are high.
