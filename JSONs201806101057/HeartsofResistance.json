This was a captivating and powerful book!This novel tells an unforgettable story about three courageous young women whose lives intersect as part of the Resistance during WWII. Sophia, Hazel and Rose come from very different backgrounds and are each determined to become part of the Resistance during WWII. I am very drawn to WWII stories, especially those that involve the brave members of the Resistance. For me, this book is a stand-out story in this genre. The writing was exquisite. The characters were unforgettable. The story was deeply touching. This is my first novel by Soraya Lane and I look forward to reading more from her. Her writing drew me in from the first chapter, her characters had my heart from the first page, her story had my full attention from the first sentence. The novel was highly intriguing and suspenseful from the first to last page.A big thank you to NetGalley, Lake Union Publishing and Soraya Lane for providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review! It was a true pleasure to read this story."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076351-kathryn", "userReview": "4.5 stars. Hearts of Resistance starts with a short prologue filled with danger that immediately starts me both worrying and asking questions about will these women survive? Then we are taken back in time and introduced one by one to three women, whom by the time the book finished I did not want to leave. Three women - one English, one German, one French and their lives are utterly changed by WW11.There is Hazel - English - engaged and watching her fiance go off to war, and in an environment that did not believe women were capable of contributing significantly to the cause. Hazel will prove that wrong, once recruited by the SOE.There is Sophia - a young German girl already helping Jewish people to escape from Berlin and hiding her Jewish boyfriend in her apartment. The horrors of the Nazi regime and her own father drive her from Germany and into the Resistance.Finally Rose a young French woman married to her dearly loved husband and as the war carries on also finds herself by circumstance caught up in the covert operations against the Germans.Eventually these three come together - work together - carry out mind and heart stopping work that really counts. They are highly trained, ready to kill if necessary and hugely passionate about the extremely dangerous work they do. Three powerful women.These three women, while fictitious, do represent so many women who showed that they were very capable and courageous during this period of history. Soraya M. Lane obviously researched this well, and she has presented an extremely wonderful tribute to these brave women.I loved the strength of these three women and the bonds of friendship that they formed. While not always an easy read it was a very realistic and eye opening read. If you coped with Kristin Hannah's The Nightingale - you'll manage this one too."}, {"userName": "The Lit Bitch", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4537892-the-lit-bitch", "userReview": "4.5 stars.This if my first official book of 2018\u2026.the first one that I read and reviewed this year. I read Lane\u2019s earlier novel, Wives of War, back in June and was really impressed with her ability to write interesting characters and a romance that I was invested in.When Hearts of Resistance came up, it was an easy yes for me to review and I was thrilled to read it and see how Lane\u2019s writing grew in the next book and what sort of romance was in store.This time we meet very different female leads than we did is her earlier book. Often women were only allowed to help the war effort as nurses, but in this novel the women we meet are practically daredevils\u2026..parachuting into occupied France? Badass. Rose and Hazel were awesome. I loved their pluck and courage.Sophia was also an interesting female lead, she was brave and courageous in her own way. Speaking out agent Hitler, and a woman to boot, would have been beyond embarrassing for the Nazi regime. I think for me her story was the most compelling because she would likely have been in the most danger. Yes helping rescue down airmen would have been dangerous as well, but Sophia was speaking out against Hitler deep in Nazi territory\u2026.the threat to her wellbeing was very real and made her story the most interesting for me.Even though these three women were \u2018fictional\u2019 they had a ring of authenticity in their stories and characters. I love books with strong women at the forefront and even though this was a fictional book, their bravery and spunk shined without seeming fake or made up. I love that about Lane\u2019s writing. She has a wonderful ability to create well thought out characters with memorable stories.Like her previous book, the romances formed quick and moved at a fast pace. Some might prefer a slow burn romance in war time books but for me I love the \u2018whirlwind\u2019 feel in this book. To me war time romances should be more whirlwind because who has time to wait when you are getting shot at and taking risks with your life? When I encounter \u2018slow burn\u2019 war romances they frustrate me. So while some felt that the romances in this book were too fast, I happened to like it and felt that it was very fitting.Overall this was a well written book and I loved how the three main characters were such strong women with believable stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves war romances and strong women who don\u2019t backdown from challenges. Inspiring!This was a great book to kick off my new year reading! Don\u2019t miss this one!See my full review here"}, {"userName": "Sue ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/690922-sue", "userReview": "The history books would have you believe that wars are won only because of the men on the front lines while the women are at home knitting socks and growing gardens. This wonderful book puts an end to that myth because its about three strong women working in the French resistance during WWII. They all have different backgrounds and different reasons for fighting against the Nazi regime but their goal is the same.Rose lives in luxury in France. Her beloved husband died and she found out afterwards that he had been helping the Resistance. She decides to carry on his role and is soon hiding British pilots in her home and helping them return to England. Hazel is engaged to a man in the British Army and wants to do more to help Britain win the war. She gets trained as an agent and dropped into France to help the resistance. Sophia has been hiding her Jewish boyfriend in her apartment in Germany. Her father was a high ranking Nazi and she was aware of what the results would be if she was discovered so she and Alex escape Germany - he goes into hiding and she vows to work with the French. All three of these women were tough and brave on their own but when they joined forces, they were a force to be reckoned with. This is a wonderful, well researched book about WWII in France and the French resistance. I loved the three main characters and their firm belief that they were willing to give up their lives to get the Germans defeated. This is a wonderful book about war and bravery and friendship between strong women.Thanks to the publisher for a copy of this book for review.

I am still swirling with emotions having just finished reading this extraordinary book! My heart has leaped with fear, in awe of these empowered women, Hazel, Rose and Sophia as they fight for freedom against the Nazis during WWII. They were strong women, courageous, facing unimaginable dangers, willing to risk their lives each for their own reasons and loves. Achingly beautiful stories for each women kept me reading with tears and cheers as many cliffhanger chapters kept the pages turning far into each night. This is one incredible book, I have not read any of this authors other books but I certainly look forward to doing so. Soraya M.

I highly recommend this book, for all those who love historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Fanna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72205668-fanna", "userReview": "Wow, I loved this! I was skeptical when picking this up since historical fiction is not always my cup of tea, but now I'm so happy I read this. \n\nHearts of Resistance is a story set in the times of World War II that perfectly features, includes and revolves around women. \nThe plot is centered around three women\u2014Sophia, Rose and Hazel\u2014who work against their expected roles at the time of a war. Instead of waiting on their partners to return from the battlefield, sewing socks for the soldiers or working in the farms, they take up front-row roles in the underground movement against the Nazis, called The Resistance. Let's start with the best aspect of this story, the one that won my heart straight away\u2014strong women. \nI can't emphasize enough about how important it is for me, as a reader, to come across characters who are not just magically or fictionally strong, but realistically powerful.\n These three women, and a few others who supported them through the story, were exactly that. Each one of them is from a different country\u2014Rose is from France, Sophia is from Germany, and Hazel is from England\u2014and how they end up together as a team in this crusade is a story different for all the three. Characters in this book grow and a good character development is one of my favorite things to gush about.. There are circumstances, instances and situations that crafts all three of them over the course of the story. Rose was an outspoken wife of a rich businessman and pregnant, Sophia had a Nazi in the name of father and a Jewish boyfriend, while Hazel was engaged to a fighter who clearly didn't deem women fit enough to take up a role that she was intending to. \nWhen they first sign up for this, with or without training, they are scared and they don't know if this would eventually be successful, if they'll ever be able to return home, but they fight anyway. \nAnd they don't look dumb at all. More often than not, when characters take impulsive decisions especially risky ones, I tend to consider them a bit stupid but here, they appear willed and positively adamant on playing their roles in this war. The realism in this book! I love a story that not only touches the practical aspects of the setting but also incorporate those in the plot. People get caught, shot, and brutally killed, because isn't that what happens in a war? \nCharacters die, even when you don't expect them to, because that's bound to happen.\n In fact, the author didn't overuse the advantage of having female main characters who could use their seductive skills while being undercover; I was so glad to not always have the three of them put on some lipstick and flirt with the Nazis to get out of situations. Kudos for a well thought, well planned and well written novel. Which brings me to yet another appreciable thing about this: writing. Everything from the dialogues to the prose is so precisely concise and yet detailed that nothing reads over-the-top for me. The novel is written in a third person POV and alternates between the three main leads. \nIt's beautifully planned out with the peaks at all the right places and the revelations at the right pace.\n Being a war story, there's also enough action and thrill in addition to the women-focused fiction. You keep wondering if they'll be caught in the next scene or if someone's gonna die in the next moment. Also, there aren't any plot holes, the credit for which I think would go to the ideas loosely based on facts because the general story line was actual during the time of WWII. \nOverall, this was one amazing read and I would recommend this to all those who like a good historical fiction that doesn't solely revolve around the battlefield but is centered around the unenlightened underground movements, and of course, strong female protagonists. \n\nDisclaimer: I received a digital copy of this book via Netgalley but that in no way influences my rating and/or opinions about it. Thank you Lake Union Publishing and Soraya M. Lane! \n\n\nBlog | Twitter | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "The Just-About-Cocky Ms M", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11969567-the-just-about-cocky-ms-m", "userReview": "I thought Wives of War was a bad, cliche-ridden potboiler with no sense of history, historical accuracy, culture, society, proper behavior by and among the characters, but this was worse, much worse.Sophomoric, pedestrian writing, the usual cardboard characters with nothing to distinguish them in any manner, predictable and poorly-constructed plot, and absolutely no idea about WWII. None.A ridiculous mash-up of Charlotte Gray, Sophie Scholl and the White Rose, and every Hollywood B-movie about the Resistance.

It was so formulaic and superficial. It's about three Resistance workers in France who become close friends. The chapters move between the perspectives of Sophia (who is German), Hazel (who is English) and Rose (who is French), but they are so poorly characterised that they all felt like the same person. I read an online interview with the author that she spends one month doing research...which is not a lot, and it shows. It doesn't ever feel real or credible.Moreover, the writing is so clunky and wooden! Here are some examples:- \"What are you most looking forward to, once this is over?\" Hazel asked. Rose wasn't sure. She honestly wasn't sure. \"I don't know\"...she sighed.- She hated the feeling of being a sitting duck, as if they were inviting the enemy to find them by staying in the same place for too long.- Hazel tripped on a tree root or something sticking out of the ground.Time and again, people say things like \"the night I lost my unborn baby feels like a lifetime ago\" - nobody talks like that! All that this book did for me was to remind me of similar books that are so much better: The Girl Who Fell From The Sky, Code Name Verity or Restless."}, {"userName": "Erica (ricci.reads)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51190658-erica-ricci-reads", "userReview": "Set during WW2 'Hearts of Resistance' follows three women from different backgrounds, exploring their roles in the resistance movement against the Nazis.It reads a lot like a contemporary romance, so you might enjoy it even if historical fiction isn't usually your thing.At times this novel was very suspenseful and each character had a distinct voice and background which was intriguing! However, the entire plot fast became unrealistic for me and characters didn't quite fully develop, and unfortunately I DNF at 59%I'd have liked to see more in the way of individual motivation for our different characters, which was too vague for me personally. Yes of course the atrocities committed during WW2 are completely abhorrent, that goes without saying! But in terms of investing characters in a novel I feel like the author relies on the readers assumed knowledge of the historical subject too heavily. I wanted to 'see' what these ladies experienced in their day to day lives to drive them to such drastic, dangerous measures.Sadly not for me, but I think there's enough there that I'd still encourage you to give it a shot if you've never read anything set during this time period before."}, {"userName": "Goldencam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7327600-goldencam", "userReview": "Hearts of Resistance, by Soraya M. Lane, follows three women through the devastation of WWII as they fight against the Nazi\u2019s across Europe. The first third of the book is one long extended recruiting montage (in a good way, as we get to know the characters and their motivations). Sophia is in love with a Jewish man, Alex, but that won\u2019t go over well with her Nazi father. When Alex\u2019s family is taken away, Sophia hides him in her Berlin apartment and helps ferry other Jews out of the city for months until she\u2019s almost found out. She and Alex have to flee, and she vows to continue fighting the evil regime in any way she can. Rose lost her husband Peter to the war in France, and heads out to their house in Brest to find some comfort, but instead finds wounded Allied soldiers and the Resistance. Hazel is feeling confined by the expectations for women in Britain, and the desire to do more than just sit at a desk translating French documents. She signs up for a covert mission, and soon finds herself fighting alongside Rose and Sophia in France in the lead up to D-Day.I thoroughly enjoyed this tale. The pacing was fast and exciting, and it was interesting to experience the war from a woman\u2019s point of view. So many of the books and movies about WWII involve the men fighting (naturally), or the women pining back home and dealing with loss. It was refreshing to read about some ladies who were out there trying to make a difference, and interesting to learn that there really were woman doing all this, and more probably, in that time."}, {"userName": "Denise Hershberger", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8225652-denise-hershberger", "userReview": "This was my first book by Lane but the cover, title, and back cover caught my eye. I love just about any novel set during WWII and I especially love strong female leads so this one about 3 strong women was perfect.I really enjoyed getting to know each of the women both separately and together. I was especially inspired by Sophia's bravery. In her circumstances I felt she was probably in the most danger for the longest amount of time. Truly though, I admire anyone who did what these ladies did during WWII working for the resistance. It would have been absolutely terrifying, yet so important.Some of the relationships in this book were a little too fast for my taste. But, then again during a war things probably can move that fast.

The book starts with Rose, Hazel, and Sophia in the middle of a very tense situation - and then jumps back in time and introduces us to the 'girls' and tells us how they got into that situation. I found myself liking each of the young ladies, especially Hazel, and crossing my fingers that they would defy the odds and make it out of the war alive. They shared a special bond because of the life and death situations they faced, on a daily basis, and the reliance they had to have on one another in order to stay alive.It had me wondering how many young people (men or women) in today's world would be willing to step up and do half of what so many people were doing during WWII. The world could have looked so much different if people hadn't done all they could do to defeat the Nazis.This book kept me reading until the very end - not wanting to put it down. There were some light-hearted moments, plenty of heart-in-your-throat action, love, loss, and tears. A good book always brings the tears somewhere along the line.
