Bit by bit, the individual stories of the characters reveal how the Ruin was caused and how the characters were involved in or affected by it. We get to meet Gabriel who attempts to end his life but instead ends up rescuing a girl from drowning in the sea. We meet Sonny, a boy who has lost his dad and spends his solitary days looking for salvage. We meet Mr Crisp, who is an old sea-dog and a storyteller. We meet Mara, an artist who returns to the reserve only to be confronted with the loss of her family. And we meet Dorian, the CEO, who is the loneliest of all of them. Even though it might sound like a depressing plot, I loved being transported into the world of this story. King's writing was superbly observant of his characters' moods, and this in turn was expressed in some great dialogues. His mocking portrayal of the hapless corporate machine made me laugh out loud quite a few times.In contrast to this, he created the group of downbeat underdogs, who despite the devastation caused by the Ruin don't give up searching for ways to return to their way of life. Again, I would have expected this aspect to be quite somber, and while it did make me think, King kept the plot spirited and quite fun - after all, the events described in The Back of the Turtle ring true enough, are real enough, that they might happen any day, and what could possible be more serious than that? \"THE light vanished, and the colours dimmed and died on the canvas. Mara put the brush down. She hadn't accomplished much, but tomorrow she would do a little more. And, after that, a little more. Until Lily and Rose and baby Riel came back to life.Life.There it was.Standing at the easel, looking at what she had created, Mara realized that she might have found a purpose, something that would help her make the world whole again.\""}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "My first Thomas King novel, but undoubtedly not my last. When I started this novel, I was somewhat reluctant\u2014reading something recommended, rather like taking medicine. Promised good results, but feeling it was a bit of a chore.That feeling was completely gone within the first chapter. The cast of characters (and they are characters) are charming, even the poor CEO, Dorian, who I came to pity. The scientist, Gabriel, who obliquely caused an event known as The Ruin, comes home to the scene of the crime, intending to see the devastation he caused and to commit suicide. However good he may be at creating toxic substances (the ironically named GreenSweep), he is not very good at self-destruction. He meets a woman who used to live on the Smoke River Reserve that was closed after The Ruin (Mara), the keeper of the hotsprings who speaks in biblical phraseology (Nicholas Crisp), and a young boy who survives by salvaging items from the beach (Sonny). You cannot help but care for all of these people, who are finding their way in the wake of the disaster, taking care of each other to greater or lesser extents. Their stories are in marked contrast to the CEO of the company which caused the disaster, Dorian who runs Domidion. King takes a lot of pokes at our current system of capitalism through the life of Dorian. One of Dorian\u2019s main scientists has gone missing and can\u2019t be found (that would be Gabriel). Two dams on tailings ponds in the Athabasca area have broken, releasing toxic sludge into the Mackenzie River system and eventually the Arctic Ocean. While investigating this disaster, the media learns of the defection of Gabriel and the connection to GreenSweep and the Smoke River Reserve\u2014Dorian is only saved from disaster by the advent of a bigger news story. But his wife has left him and he is reduced to shopping to try to make himself feel better. We witness his random purchases\u2014expensive ties, extravagant watches, exclusive scent. When he arrives home and is still sad, he attributes the feeling to the fact that he did not buy TWO watches, when really how many watches can one person wear? He truly is the poor little rich man.Despite its very intelligent swipes at capitalism, environmental problems, consumerism and the like, this is a highly engaging, highly entertaining work which will leave you with a good feeling about the world."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1798222-shane", "userReview": "Couched as a lightly humorous and sweetly human tale, King takes cracks at the chemical industry, the gun lobby, capitalism and other forms of human enterprise that are degrading the planet.A conscientious scientist, Gabriel, returns to his home to commit suicide when he discovers that his invention, used indiscriminately as a defoliant, has killed off his entire native reserve somewhere in British Columbia. All the birds and turtles have left Samaritan Bay as a result of this environmental calamity. And yet he has to wait until the tide rises higher to succeed in his mission. In the meantime, he comes across a motley band of survivors who give him a reason to reconsider his decision: Crisp the archaic-tongued philosopher who knows the history of the place, Mara who is painting the images of dead people in order to recapture what existed before the fateful event, Soldier the dog who follows Gabriel faithfully, Sonny the boy who is building a tower on the beach to bring the sea creatures back, and the mysterious sea people who keep coming out of the waves and disappearing.On the other side of the country, Gabriel\u2019s boss, Dorian, the CEO of Domidion, the company responsible for the defoliant, peregrinates through his empty life, heading off other environmental disasters caused by the company, shopping extravagantly to justify his wealth, roaming the streets at night to discover himself, looking for the perfect condominium investment, and trying to find out why his wife is intent on divorcing him.Between these circular perambulations, King gets to make comments on the ills facing our industrialized society: \u201cagricultural research pursued for profit leads to environmental disaster,\u201d \u201cthere are too many rich and poor\u201d (i.e. the hollowing out of the middle class), \u201ccapitalism is the extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all,\u201d \u201cwe need more guns, not less,\u201d\u201ca lie oft repeated becomes a truth,\u201d and \u201cdemocracy offers its enemies a means of destroying it.\u201dBut natural evolution trumps human-induced disaster and the turtles start returning to the island, along with all those who had fled. Even the defoliant carrying vessel makes a re-appearance on Samaritan Bay before breaking adrift and heading back from whence it had come. The mystery of the sea people is solved, and Gabriel discovers that sleeping with a woman is not that bad an experience, while his boss finds out that sleeping alone is the best course open to him.I found the characters enjoyable, even Dorian is charming in his way, and I did not mind spending time with them in this rather slow-paced novel that moves through all the principal characters\u2019 POV in circular fashion. Just as I finished reading, I read in the newspaper that the author had won the Governor General\u2019s Award for Fiction for this novel, and I thought that this was astute upon the part of the judges to highlight a book that brings most of our current political pre-occupations to the forefront and addresses them in a non-didactic fashion: the harsh treatment of native populations, the pollution of the environment, corporate greed, and the silencing of the scientific community. And King rounds it off by having the human spirit triumph above all these challenges."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "He turned towards the eastern mountains, angled the drum to catch the rising sun, and began a memorial song. But the elk skin was too soft now, too damp. The beats slid off, and his voice was drowned in the rushing water. In the distance he could see the dog laid out on higher ground.And in that moment, in that moment, he thought about retreating once again.But the path back was only memory now, all safety choked off as the sea ringed the Apostles in ink and foam.He began the song anew, picking up the beat and raising the pitch, so that his voice carried above the slicing surf. The sun was in full force now, the sky blue and polished. It was going to be a good day.\nThus are we introduced to Gabriel: a stranger new to Samaritan Bay, bent on suicide by ocean tide until his singing seems to conjure people from the waves that he must rescue; perhaps auguring a new beginning; a \"time for the twins to walk the earth again and restore the balance that had been lost\". And although The Back of the Turtle is told from the alternating points of view of five different characters, this book seems to be Gabriel's story most of all as he reveals and confronts his own past and the terrible results of his life's work. Samaritan Bay used to be a popular tourist destination on the B.C. coast, with people flocking to see the annual hatching of baby sea turtles. But then The Ruin happened: the Smoke River ran bright green and killed everything it coursed through; including the turtle nesting grounds; including a large swath of the ocean where the river meets the sea; including a Native Reserve which became so contaminated that those people who weren't killed were dispersed to other Reserves, their own land condemned in perpetuity. As Gabriel discovered back in his life as a biochemist in Toronto, it was an industrial accident with the uncontrollable defoliant he had developed -- known as GreenSweep and never approved for real world use -- that poisoned the Smoke River and eventually had devastatingly personal results for him; small wonder he turns up in Samaritan Bay, climbing the rocky pillars known locally as the Apostles, ready to make a sacrifice of himself. Having saved the sea people and lost the high tide for now, Gabriel gets to know some of the locals as he waits for it to return: locals like the curiously named Nicholas Crisp (with a bald head and \"a red beard that floated around his face like a cloud on fire\" making Gabriel fancy \"the fellow had somehow got his head on upside down\"), who speaks even curiouser, here in conversation with Gabriel:\n\"The Apostles is good exercise at low tide, if ye have no aversion to climbing about on carcasses and bones. But watch your back. The sea's a shifty slut. She'll tide in behind and suck ye up in a salty slurp.\"\"I'm not sure how long I'll stay.\"\"There's wisdom enough in that for shirts and pants to fit us all.\"\nGabriel also meets Sonny, the young proprietor of the perpetually vacant Ocean Star Motel, and as Crisp describes him, \"The boy's poorly lit, but a sweet neighbour\" (think of a cross between Norman Bates of Psycho and Tom Cullen of The Stand). Always on the lookout for salvage on \"his beach\", Sonny carries a pouch with a hammer, wire cutters and a multi-head screwdriver that jig-jig-jiggles against his thigh as he walks and picks up interesting items:\nSonny holds the drum to his nose and discovers that it smells like bacon. Not exactly like bacon, but something tasty that has smoke and fat in it. He can't wait to show Dad the drum. When Sonny shows Dad the drum, Dad will surely take him in his arms and say, Behold my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.Wham-wham, hammer-hammer.\nGabriel also meets Mara -- a Native woman who had been living in Toronto, working as an artist, when The Ruin happened, who has returned to the community to confront her own guilt about abandoning her mother and grandmother on the Reserve -- and Soldier, an apparently talking dog (if Crisp's translations are to be trusted).Meanwhile, back in Toronto, we meet Dorian Asher: the cartoonish paragon of corporate capitalism; the CEO of Domidion (a villainous conglomerate -- part Monsanto, part BP -- housed in an underground concrete bunker); and Gabriel's former boss. Dorian responds to environmental and human disasters in terms of dollars and PR, and soothes stress with luxury shopping sprees. When Dorian learns that a tanker ship of GreenSweep has been lost at sea, he's happy that he won't need to keep looking for a Third World country to take it off his hands for containment (even though he's well aware of the devastation it will cause in the ocean and that there is a crew involved); when he learns that a tailings pond in Athabasca has failed, spilling heavy metals into the waterways, Dorian goes on a PR blitz (making a sordid comparison to the NRA's aggressive reaction to the gun control efforts after the Sandy Hook school shootings), and when he learns that the only human casualties resultant from this pollution are on Reserves, he's satisfied that he'll be able to blur the line of culpability by blaming the known high-mortality-rate-due-to-lifestyle among Natives; even flipping through a Sports Illustrated that recalls the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction, Dorian comes to an odd conclusion:World hunger can't make the back page of  TV Guide, but an almost bare breast can destroy the morality of a nation. Dorian shook his head. No wonder democracy and Christianity had been such failures.A few implausibilities: I recall that in The Inconvenient Indian, Thomas King described \"Christianity as the gateway drug to supply-side capitalism\" and he had little respect for either -- and as a Native, that seems fair enough -- but would Dorian plausibly think that democracy and Christianity had been failures? Would an executive involved in extracting oil in Athabasca refer to them as the \"tar sands\"? When Mara looks at the abandoned Reserve where she grew up, she notes that it is ringed now with barbed wire, with a school bus parked to block the entrance, upon which someone had spray-painted \"Indians go home\". Would even the lowest of a low-life redneck ignoramus paint \"Indians go home\" at the entrance to a Reserve? I make the complaint about implausibilities because this book could have been more compelling without the exaggerations. Gabriel and Mara were both interesting and complex characters and their paths back from guilt and depression would have been more effective if their situations had been completely honest -- the over-the-top depiction of Dorian Asher (whose sections were often funny and bitingly satirical, arguably making him the most interesting character in the book) detracted from what could have been a powerful message: there certainly are environmental disasters occurring, which disproportionately affect marginalised people, but if the guy responsible is portrayed as Goldfinger or Dr. Evil, it's easy to dismiss his actions as either sensationalism or propaganda (which, perversely, gives him a free pass to behave as he likes). I wish that there had been more backstory for Crispin and Sonny -- as the only two white men portrayed on the West Coast, their eccentricities could have been better explained -- but I totally believed and empathised with Mara's story. On the other hand, there seemed to be blanks in Gabriel's history: I have no idea why he and his father moved to Minnesota together, leaving his mother and sister behind in Lethbridge (described as \"small town cruel\", which can also be explained by information in The Inconvenient Indian) or why the women would then disappear to B.C.; there are hints as to how Stanford educated the ethics out of Gabriel, but I would have liked more information about his job at Domidion, to learn if he was conflicted at all in the moment; and writing the names of man-made disasters all over the walls of his home before running away seems like the act of an unhinged man, but that's not really the Gabriel that we meet (despite the suicidal impulses).Thomas King is certainly a gifted writer and I believe that he was sincere in his efforts to write an important message book here, but as so often happens with such projects, the ultimate value of the message is in the hands of the reader: those who agree with his politics (those who would say \"tar sands\" instead of \"oil sands\") will likely rate The Back of the Turtle higher than those who bristle at such usage. The plot here had many, many interesting developments (even if they weren't exactly surprising), fine characters, and King is positively lyrical when writing about nature. In the final analysis, I found this book to be flawed but human; an interesting contribution to the national conversation."}, {"userName": "Steven Langdon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864496-steven-langdon", "userReview": "The Canadian literary fiction prizes for 2014 have diverged dramatically with three different novels receiving recognition. Of the three, I have to say, I have been most pleased by this book winning the Governor General's prize. \"Us Conductors,\" the Giller victor, is an interesting novel that will propel a new author, Sean Michaels, into prominence. \"All My Puny Sorrows\" by Miriam Toews, awarded the Rogers Writers Trust prize, is very emotionally powerful. This book, though, has a fierce bite and a scathing urgency that provoke superb satire and a crucial environmental critique. The award to this novel will underline the importance of Canadians reading it.At the heart of this book is a small B.C. Indian reserve, just beside the fictional coastal settlement of Samaritan Bay. Previously a sanctuary for turtles and other wildlife, it has been virtually wiped out, people included, through the mistaken application of an Agent Orange type defoliant called GreenSweep by the giant Canadian multinational Domidion. This is the same corporation, as the book opens, that is suddenly experiencing dangerous outflows of toxic sludge from its holding pools into the Athabasca River in Alberta associated with tar sands oil production. The novel plots how a series of sharply sketched characters move through the days that follow -- there is aboriginal Gabriel the genius scientist who developed the defoliant, fought against its release, then deserted the company to flee secretly to the stricken reserve where he now plans a guilty suicide -- there is Mara the aboriginal artist who had fled the reserve and has now returned, also afflicted by guilt at her absence when disaster hit and by new doubts over her attraction to Gabriel -- there is Crisp the white keeper of the local hot springs who has his own source of guilt since he did not contact Gabriel as soon as he should have when the scientist's estranged sister asked him to -- and then there is Dorian Asher the self-centred and narcissistic CEO of Domidion who is a focus of blistering amusement and contempt for author King. The latter is a man who doesn't read, who cannot get any enjoyment from the arts, who is untouched emotionally by his wife leaving him in the middle of the book, and whose deepest agonies focus on whether to buy one or two luxury watches.Asher is the most obvious figure of ridicule in this sharp-edged book. But it is fair to say that King is generally dismissive of the humans who populate the novel. Nowhere does Gabriel really have an explanation, even to himself, of why his beliefs in science, rooted as they were in ethical ideals, led him to the work in which he engaged and the sorts of products which he produced. Nor does Mara ever come to terms with her relationship with Gabriel. She demands that he stay, not commit suicide, for her sake. But she cannot ever seem to let herself actually reach for him. Crisp, too, is too much the gnomic observer to actually build a strong relationship, except with the dog; even the ties with Sonny his nephew seem stilted.In the end, this is a satire about human weakness. Perhaps we are all just like shipwreck victims, the powerless figures pushed by tides and powerful waves; we ride on the backs of turtles who carry us to our fates.Maybe this should be seen as a book about the power of nature itself -- of the non-human forces that have a resilience and strength of endurance that many people lack. Perhaps the real hero of this book is Big Red, the giant turtle that King seems to suggest may even have made her way all across the country from Toronto to the ocean in B.C. This, then, is not just a book about the threats to the environment that come from our irresponsible corporate sector, our misguided politics and our easily distracted media (though these are all targets for King.) This is also a novel with some sense of hopefulness, based on the drive for survival that nature embodies."}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "...So I was very glad to get back to normal fiction, written by one person with one viewpoint and writing style, and that it was Thomas King, whose Green Grass, Running Water absolutely blew my mind a couple of weeks ago was an added bonus.

He uses some First Nations myths, and some Christian symbolism, to tell the story of Samaritan Bay, a fictional reserve on the British Columbia coast destroyed by an error in calculation when a newly developed defoliant is used to clear vegetation around a pipeline site. The various participants and victims each have their sub-stories and the result is a fast-paced book that, despite its 518 pages, I finished in 2 days."}, {"userName": "Shirley Schwartz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278399-shirley-schwartz", "userReview": "This is a truly wonderful book told by a master storyteller. I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, but it won the 2014 Governor General's prize for fiction, so I thought it would be worth a read. The book is absolutely stellar! King hasn't written a book for 15 years since his Canadian classic Green Grass, Running Water. Maybe it takes 15 years to create a book of this magnitude. I can't say enough good things about this book. King is a major literary talent. His stories are chock-a-block full of lifelike characters living real-life lives-with humour, pathos, sadness, depression, hope and many other human emotions. They live and breathe on the page because of his skill. King's description of native emotions and folklore s evocative and haunting. We also get an insider's look at big oil and agricultural companies and how they travel roughshod over our environment, and this appalling and insightful probe into the big issues in the environment is handled with a light hand and a twist of humour. The book ends on a surge of hopefulness when we see life returning to a tiny decimated seaside community. I highly recommend this book.

I very much liked the beginning and the conclusion, but got bogged down and bored at times. Now that I understand how everything fits together I would rate it higher in retrospect. The book starts with despair, chronicles a dreadful environmental and human disaster, and ends with a glimmer of hope. We meet Gabriel while he is waiting for the tide to sweep him out to sea to his death. He plays the drum and sings while awaiting his suicide. It is interrupted when he sees a girl with almond shaped eyes and long black hair who appears to be drowning. She must have fallen from the sky into the sea. This resembles Native creation folk lore about a woman who fell from the sky. Gabriel rescues her and then others appear thrashing in the water. He struggles to save them, and exhausted discovers they have all vanished. Magic realism or something else? The tide is now wrong for his suicide, so he must wait. We learn that Gabriel was a brilliant scientist who developed a defoliant called Green Sweep. This was used by a company called Domidon to remove vegetation around a pipeline, and was never approved for use. Gabriel has come to the town of Samaritan Bay on the BC coast. This town was a popular tourist destination where people flocked to see the annual hatching of the baby turtles and their journey to the sea. Then came the 'Ruin' when the rivers and sea became poisoned, destroying the turtle nesting ground, fish, animals and sea birds. Stores and other businesses shut down. A nearby Native Reservation was horribly affected. Many died and the survivors were moved away. Gabriel's mother and sister were among those who died.  Gabriel feels guilty and depressed. He decides to visit the few people who remain in the town while he awaits suicide. We and Gabriel meet Sonny, a sweet young boy, who may be intellectually challenged, psychotic, or both. Sonny lives in the vacant motel and spends time scavenging on the beach and tapping with a hammer. There is Crisp, an eccentric, older man who spends time soaking in the hot pools. His way of expressing himself is lyrical and one of the most entertaining part of the book. Mara, a native woman, has returned to the reservation from Toronto where she was an artist. Her mother and grandmother died when the reservation was poisoned. There is also Soldier, a dog, who attaches himself to each character. The story shifts to Darian, the CEO of Domidon in Toronto. He seems to care little for the environmental damage and human deaths caused. He is scrambling and scheming to do damage control through lies while twisting and minimizing the facts. He combats stress by daily purchasing extravagant goods and services or thinking what to buy next.  As Sonny, Mara, Crisp and Gabriel interact the story heads to an interesting and exciting climax. Gabriel is again sitting on a ledge waiting for the tide to sweep him away. The ending was unexpected as we learn the reason for the interruption of his previous suicide attempt at the start of the book. There are hopeful signs pointing to the future rebirth of Samaritan Bay."}, {"userName": "Cathryn Wellner", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4546014-cathryn-wellner", "userReview": "Though I was captivated from the first words, I stumbled over the first half of this book. Not for a minute did I consider NOT finishing it. I loved the differing perspectives, the people caught in a web not of their spinning. But I was confused at the start. I had read nothing about the book, just picked it up from the Quick Reads shelves at the local library. I love Thomas King's writing and knew I would appreciate whatever he wrote. But I felt as if I was in the middle of a post-apocalyptic novel, when I was actually reading a post-horrible-environmental-accident novel. That is a different kettle of fish, no less appalling for those in the path but not engaging the entire planet.The characters were compellingly described, the forward thrust of the novel engagingly written. In spite of my having to shift gears, from global disaster (what I thought at first) to regional disaster (what I came to understand), I was caught from the first page and not released until the end.As a BC resident, I fear the impact of all the potential disasters our premier is giddily proposing for our province.

King's prose is so believable and seemingly inevitable that I found myself researching every disaster he mentioned. It reminds me of The Handmaid's Tale in that it is a warning of what is to come if we don't change our current mindset and practices. It is also a story of beautiful characters.

There are so many stories within these pages! Who is Gabriel? Who is Krisp? Sonny and Dad? And who is Master Dog? There are many layers to these characters. The two main men, Gabriel and Dorian, live in opposites....east vs west, city vs the land, plenty vs nothing, living on the land and living underground. In the end, I realized this was a book that I simply enjoyed reading, no page counting here. I especially liked being connected to the earth when reading it.

What a beautiful, evocative, lush novel by Thomas King. We follow Dr. Gabriel Quinn as he returns to Smoke River Reserve - both his family's former home and a place devastated by an environmental disaster that he helped create as head scientist at Domidion. We meet a small cast of wonderful characters and follow their stories through a path of healing, compassion, recovery, redemption and forgiveness. King's prose is that perfect mixture of sparse and flowery - absolutely poetic and a pleasure to read. I couldn't put the novel down - the atmosphere, story, and imagery was so compelling and haunting. Also... turtles. You can't go wrong with turtles as both as a metaphor and as a literal character. The title - and its meaning - perfectly encapsulates everything about this novel. 4.5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36056436-nicole", "userReview": "Book 3/45. I am so behind on my reading goal. whoopsie!!!Anyhow, I love this book. Mr. King is probably my favourite Canadian author due to his wit, flow, and creativity. The Back of the Turtle does a great job looking at the environmental and community impact of toxic spills/deliberate contamination, especially in vulnerable communities. Although I am pro on GMO technology when studied and safety checked (for our food it very much is, I don't know about modifying bacteria as a defoliant though) and I am pro pipeline, this book does a thought provoking number on how diverse the issues under consideration are. There are many areas of concern to focus on to make technology work safely, and effectively. It is important to listen to community voices, especially impacted First Nation communities, when it comes to things like pipeline construction. Environmental devestation does occur, so how do we prevent and mitigate risk."}, {"userName": "Mary Mackenzie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72604466-mary-mackenzie", "userReview": "MUST READ."}, {"userName": "Mook", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39085011-mook", "userReview": "Sonny is energetic, confused, and determined to watch the beach for salvage and guide the turtles back to Smoke River. Crisp is generous, larger than life, and works to keep what's left of the community from falling apart. Mara paints her pain, portraits of the dead to accompany her in the deserted reservation. And finally there is Gabriel, who has destroyed everything: his career, the reservation, his family and the lives of all those who used to live in Smoke River Reserve (human, animal, and plants alike). Gabriel has come back home to kill himself. But he finds himself saving people from the sea, rediscovering the past through different eyes, and maybe finding a reason to keep living despite himself.Thomas King is a fantastic novelist. It's easy to guess at his literary background; his work is full of references to other works, stated outright or hidden within sentences (I'm sure there were many more than the ones I spotted). The book does not have a neat resolution. There are a lot of things left hanging in the air: Domidion's responsibility for several catastophes that is never addressed, the ambiguousness of Mara and Gabriel's friendship, the hesitancy between Crisp and Sonny. But as Gabriel notes, life is rarely a neat circle. Some things can't be forgiven or forgotten - but life moves on regardless."}, {"userName": "Eric Wright", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4025401-eric-wright", "userReview": "The reader unravels the mysteries in King's novel like peeling off the layers of a very, very large onion. Voices shift rapidly within each chapter between Gabriel, a brilliant scientist, Mara, a bossy woman, Soldier a stay dog, Sonny who runs a dilapidated motel, and Nicholas Crisp, a rascally old soul. The scene is set at the devastated Smoke River Reserve where Gabriel, the author of the environmental disaster not finding his mother and sister ineptly attempts suicide. Almost everyone is missing in the Reserve, killed or forced to flee by the environmental catastrophe that destroyed all life, human, animal, plant, fish. Far away in Toronto, Dorian, Ceo of the powerful Domidion corporation has his own personal and corporate problems. Where has Dr. Quinn (Gabriel)disappeared to and why was he collating lists of all of the corporate disasters that have plagued mankind? The scene occasionally shifts from the Smoke River Reserve to Dorian in Toronto with focus on his power, wealth, and his own rather ineptness. King gives us a parable of the carelessness of our culture in the face of environmental dangers. Money talks, forget about future dangers. \"Science was supposed to have been the answer. World h8unger. Disease. Energy. Security. Commerce. Biolgoy would save the world. Geology would fuel the future. Physics would make sense of the universe. At one time, science had been Gabriel's answer to everything....Love. Friendship.

It is also a very interesting read. The characters are intriguing, both in their own right and in conjunction with other characters. The subject matter is very relevant to our times, the primary concern being the degradation of human rights and the environment.It is a story of humans, from many segments of life who each bring their perspective to bear on the world that they face. Everyone is sympathetic and no one is perfect. I would highly recommend this book to anyone but perhaps particularly those who are not as exposed to the genetic experiments currently taking place. Rather than focusing on the science of practices like genetic engineering it focuses on the human face, forcing us to ask why we feel we can take such risks with the world that gave us life.Favourite quote: \"...but having lived in such luxury and security for so long, the wealthy must feel cheated by the equality of death.\" pg. 451"}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20197516-valerie", "userReview": "I haven't read Thomas King before so had no basis in comparison. I do know that An Inconvenient Indian has had stellar reviews and feedback so I expected good things from this, his first fiction work in 15 years.It was a difficult start and took some time for me to find the groove of his writing style; I found the changes in time periods a bit confusing sometimes each paragraph was in a different age! But, once I got the style of Mr King's writing I was completely immersed in this strange world he'd created. This book could have easily gone off the rails and into the world of Science Fiction, but it stayed true. I really really liked this book, I loved his wit, the self effacement of his principals, the dying CEO, Mara the aboriginal artist returned to her roots, strange Sonny and the water people - he captured it all so utterly I was sorry that the book ended. I really enjoyed The Back of the Turtle - and if you like a story that will mystify, confound and amaze you then this is the book for you."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15990995-catherine", "userReview": "Read full review: http://hotpepperlatte.com/index.php/2...Often in the pursuit of literary excellence authors\u2019 metaphors become epic or pretentious. My favourite thing about King is that he sheds all of that pretension but still accomplishes great writing.

Hash brown hair, egg yolk eyes, soft butter lips, and a short stack of pancakes for a chin.\u201dThe themes are classic and for that reason, riveting: it\u2019s good versus evil, nature versus urbanization, wealth versus poverty. Add in imagery from Native and Christian mythology and a discussion on the moralities of science and oil become a literary masterpiece.

He can also be relied upon to have thoroughly researched his subject matter down to high end fashions and watches!! The characters are diverse and yet authentically portrayed. I appreciate when an author gives each character their own voice, vocabulary and context. When there are many characters and their development involves chronological shifts it can cause some lag or initial confusion trying to sort them out. Fortunately, the confusion was minimized because of their diversity. This is my second book by King. The first was non-fiction. It was interesting to compare that to his fiction.
