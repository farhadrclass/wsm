The book is set in the Arab-American community in Los Angeles, and dances around some very complex family dynamics, love, and Arab culture. I found the book to be very slow at times, but liked the focus on Arab food/recipes and the differences highlighted among various Arab cultures. Chef Sirine and Professor Hanif made some poor decisions. Also, I found the Arab fable at the beginning of each chapter to be more annoying than interesting despite its mysticism.I preferred Pauls Toutonghi's Evil Knievel Days, which had similar themes.Favorite irreverent quote:  In reality, dogs are only reincarnated monks who didn't say their prayers right.\""}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/588488-rebecca", "userReview": "This book's description of Arabs, particularly students and academics, who live in the diaspora is heartbreakingly accurate. Abu-Jaber's descriptions are both intense and palpable. Just as you can taste the mujadara, so too can you feel the homesickness of the characters. Most are suffering from the type of homesickness that anyone plucked from their native home and transplanted into a foreign land would suffer. Sirine, the protagonist, suffers from a different kind of homesickness. Hers is a complex one that weaves together loss, love, crisis of identity, and misunderstanding. Beautifully painful to read."}, {"userName": "Sunshine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/478617-sunshine", "userReview": "This book gets an extra star (its fourth) for telling a story of a fair, blond iraqi-american woman born and bred in L.A., working an Arab kitchen in Tehrangeles.There are few, very few, pieces of fiction of second-generation arabs/persians/muslims in the states. (lots of memoir, yes, - and some crap, like roth's lovely little take - but very little fiction) So this gets extra points for filling a deep whole on the shelf. Also gets that extra star for repping us halfies! Another deep hole on my shelf. I'm a fair/blond iranian-american second-genner, and I have *NEVER* seen a story about someone like me in that regard. It was like reading candy and gulping water all at once!Loses a star because the narrative/writing are a little loose; like reading a good draft that still needs a revision or two and a good editor. Kinda weird cuz it's really good in a lot of respects and then it'll lose its way for a few pages or a paragraph of over-description. But it kept bouncing back, and I kept caring more and more about the characters despite the text's flaws. And it had so much love; so much love for these characters and the community and the depths of the pain of exile and family distance and war and horrible geographies. It was all there, with love and a healing touch. So thank you Diana Abu-Jaber, I'll have to check out your earlier novel \"Arabian Jazz\".(because of the loose writing, folks who don't have a topical interest may lose interest reading this one. but if you have an interest it'll probably keep you going, like me)"}, {"userName": "Serene", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/520483-serene", "userReview": "At the end of my edition of this book was an interview with the author, and she confesses her model for her novel was the Shakespearian play, Othello. I think that is the key to the problems I had with the book - characters undertaking dramatic actions for no apparent reason and having all the secrets behind their motivations only revealed at the end. Worked for Shakespeare, but I'm not so sure if it works for a modern novel. I wanted to know why, for example, Sirine was so enchanted with Hanif - his allure seems purely physical - or why Hanif all of a sudden feels he needs to risk arrest to go to Iraq, after so many years of exile. Even when I understood the characters' reasons at the end of the book, I didn't feel them.But let me say this for Abu-Jaber: her prose is lovely, and I loved the bits of fairy tale at the beginning of each chapter.

It talks and talks and talks and says NOTHING.Okay let's start with the main character: Sirine. Somehow she's supposed to be the heroine of the story, but she doesn't do anything. Like, quite literally, she does NOTHING in this book. I don't know what she contributes to the plot (not that there's much of that either). She cooks a bunch, that she does. But she never has anything interesting to say, or even think. And men seem to fall for her, for mysterious reasons that Diana Abu-Jaber doesn't share with her readers. There is absolutely ZERO substance to Sirine. There is not an iota of information in the book that actually gives her some personality (minus the constant references to her hair). The synopsis on the book cover says that Sirine \"finds herself questioning...her own torn identity as an Arab-American\" - but there is no torn identity in this book. Sirine doesn't speak Arabic, and doesn't give off any airs that she wishes she had learned. She has no desire to travel beyond her small neighbourhood, let alone another country - even one that might help this so-called \"torn identity\" Abu-Jaber claims her main character suffers from.We barely even get a physical description of Sirine, beyond \"skin so pale is has the bluish cast of skim milk...wild blond head of hair...sea-green eyes.\" We don't know how tall she is, her body build, nothing descriptive. Not that this is necessary, but it just illustrates how little we know about the protagonist. (But we do know she keeps a spare swimsuit in the trunk of her car...just in case?! Wtf...)Then there's this silly character, Nathan. He's some kind of photographer who is obsessed with Sirine's boyfriend, Hanif. He's been to the middle East so he possesses a deep knowledge of the world which he carries on his shoulders. I knew SO early on in the book that Nathan's Iraqi love would be Hanif's sister, it was almost painful. Gah, so obvious. Then theres the fact that he's a creepy stalker who follows Sirine around and takes pictures of her with men. And he lives in a derelict \"shack\"...I mean...seriously?!And of course we have Hanif, who is supposed to be this kind of demi-god, all \"chocolate voice\" and \"cocoa skin\" and \"nutmeg scent\" and of course there are strands of hair always falling over his forehead. And of course he's broken and wounded inside and can't fully show himself to Sirine. He at least has slightly more substance, and the love for the country that he's been torn away from is actually quite touching!Moving on, there's Rana - the silliest character in this ridiculous novel. She's an American-Saudi woman who is a student in Hanif's class and who Sirine's thinks is in love with Han. Of course Rana is also unbelievably gorgeous and smart and young. She really serves no purpose except to provoke feelings of unease in Sirine. She invites Sirine to a Women for Islam meeting, which Sirine attends, but then that little plotline fizzles out quicker than it started. Now THAT would have been interesting - Sirine converts to radical Islam!!! Next time we see Rana, she cuts in between Sirine and Han during a dance, and Sirine, overcome with jealousy, thinks Rana stole the scarf Han gave her. So Sirine pulls off Rana's headscarf, only to realize it's not the same scarf...then she runs away. Somehow Rana is cool with this (ummm what?! Last time I checked it was extremely offensive for a veiled woman to have her headscarf ripped off...) and then explains to Sirine her child-marriage which she ran away from and how she likes to chase men down until they sleep with her. And that's the end of Rana's character.Who's next? Okay, there's Um-Nadia and Mireille, more characters with zero personality who work in the restaurant with Sirine.How about Aziz, the silly poet. His role is to chase after Sirine, who eventually gives in to him, not once but twice - first kissing outside her house, and then SLEEPING WITH HIM (what?!?!) after a concert. And both of them kind of brush off this incident, even though Aziz claims that Han is one of his best friends, and Sirine claims she loves Han. Right...Now then there's the annoying stories that begin each chapter. Some silly tale of Abdelrahman Salahadin. What is the purpose of these snippets?!Finally, there's the prose. Now, don't get me wrong, I like good descriptive language as much as the next person, but honestly there comes a time when it just gets pretentious and annoying. Here are some examples:\"The day is a sunburst of smog and mist; it shines in the straight-arrow streets and brown wandering canyons and azure reflecting pools. It's in the wild-field spindles of lavender and heather. It touches the baking rooftops, scaly chicken-foot streets. The spiked plant growing in ditches and open fields. Yellow things sharp as skeletons and horned devilish plants and hard blue scrub gnarled as knuckles. It rises and crosses a semi-lunar horizon, great open page of sky, faintly salty, traces of fruit, citrus, water in the wind.\"\"...the sound that contains the scent of berries, chocolate, and mint, that tastes of salt and oil and blood, that sounds like a heart's murmur, the passage of clouds, the call to praters, the beloved's name, and a distant ringing in the ears.\"And there are so many more passages that I can't quote right now....but it's especially the ones to do with either describing Han or talking about cooking that are the most annoying. Han always smells like nutmeg or clove or orange blossom or lightly scented jasmine. And in the cooking there's always saffron and sage and pepper and chocolate and roasted herbs and pickled lemons and on and on and on. It just gets a bit much after a while!!All in all, this book is a waste. The only reason I read it to the end (and that was after skipping over several large chunks) was to confirm my initial suspicions about Nathan and Han's sister.Also, as soon as I read \"Sirine's uncle\" for the first time, I knew we would never find out what her uncle's name was. And we never did!The only reason it gets two stars is because it made my mouth water with all the discussions of delicious middle Eastern food. And because there are a few recipes in the back of the book. A very small redeeming quality to an overall disaster of literary fiction."}, {"userName": "H\u0454llyB\u0454lly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3258756-h-llyb-lly", "userReview": "[ the fact that she goes off kissing and sleeping with a friend of Hanif's just because she was a bit unsure of where they were in their relationship is incredibly wrong and dumb (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Candice", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/189647-candice", "userReview": "One of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. Now I would like to read other books by this author. Loved the characters - some were quirky, some mysterious, all believable. Sirene is in her late 30s, the daughter of an Iraqi father and American mother. She works as a cook in an Arab restaurant in Los Angeles. Following the death of her parents, she was raised by her uncle, a wonderful man who likes to tell stories. So intertwined with the story of Sirene is a fable made up by her uncle about some of their ancestors. Sirene falls in love with Hanif, an Iraqi man who teaches at the same college as her uncle. The language and descriptions are absolutely beautiful. I often stopped to reread something because of the way it was written. Foodies will love the descriptions of Sirene's cooking. Those of us who like to read about other cultures will like the book because it portrays Iraqis, indeed all Middle Easterners as real people. Those who like stories about love and relationships will like the relationship Sirene has with her uncle, and of course the love story with Han.

Abu-Jaber did a great job infusing Arab culture (language, art, food, poetry) into a story set in LA. The love story, too, was refreshing--the characters were much older. It was interesting to me because an unmarried Arab woman in her late 30s is not generally someone who is looked upon with as much awe and respect as was Sirine. Like others, I was not a fan of Abu-Jaber's structure and thought that the fable that continued from the beginning of one chapter to another (but was not part of the first chapter of part 2 for some reason) was a distraction. I wish, though, that I had not skimmed through it and paid more attention, as it somewhat brought together the end of the story. One thing--and this is just a personal pet peeve--I thought the description on the back cover of my particular book was HORRIBLY written.

Her publisher must be nervous about the political climate, but it's refreshing to see Iraqis outside \"the axis of evil.\" In Crescent, they're struck by Cupid's arrows instead of Tomahawk missiles.The story takes place in Los Angeles, but like the rest of us at the moment, every character is fixated on the Middle East. Arab students and professors congregate at Nadia's Caf\ufffd, a Lebanese restaurant where they can linger over foreign newspapers, argue about poetry, and drink coffee without being cautioned, \"This Beverage Is Extremely Hot!\"\"Everything about these young men seemed infinitely vulnerable and tender,\" Abu-Jaber writes, in one of many passages rendered more poignant by the current crisis. They're all consumed with loneliness, and they're all bashfully in love with the chef, Sirine. \"She is so kind and gentle-voiced and her food is so good that the students cannot help themselves \u2014 they sit at the tables, leaning toward her.\"She hasn't left West Hollywood for years, but from her Iraqi father, she learned how to conjure up the aromas of their lost desert home. Cookbooks have been her only travel guides. At 39, she knows far more about spices than politics. Orphaned as a little girl, she's been living with a kindly uncle who teaches in the Near Eastern Studies department at the university.In his own gentle way, he encourages her to get married, and her distressingly slow progress in that direction is the subject of considerable discussion and analysis by the cafe staff. \"She's always had more men in her life than she's known what to do with,\" the narrator explains, but somehow nothing ever comes of it. \"She's never broken up with anyone, she just loses track of them.\"Then, as must always happen when we've established that the woman is beyond reach, in walks The One. In this case, he's Han, a strikingly good-looking, moderately famous Near East scholar. But as soon as Sirine spots him, she \"thinks spinster and hugs her elbows.\" This modest cafe chef would never dream of attracting the attention of a world-renowned intellectual who leaves devoted followers in his wake. But he's captivated by her, and before long, they're cooking together.That's not a Monitoresque euphemism: They're actually cooking together. But one of the great pleasures of this sensitive novel is the way Abu-Jaber stirs these culinary metaphors. \"The ingredients inside Han and herself called to each other,\" she writes, \"like the way ingredients in a dish speak to each other, a taste of ginger vibrates with something like desire beside a bit of garlic, or the way a sip of wine might call to the olive oil in a dish.\" Indeed, when Abu-Jaber describes them making baklava together, it's a lot more erotic than what passes for love scenes in most modern novels.With a little more zaniness, this could have been My Big Fat Iraqi Wedding, but Abu-Jaber prepares a more complex dish that's equal parts romantic comedy, political protest, fairy tale, and cultural analysis. As one of the cafe patrons notes, in Iraq \"everything's sort of folded up and layered.\"Indeed, the sweet humor that Crescent delivers so deftly is richly complemented by its exploration of loneliness.With her characteristic melodrama, the cafe owner says, \"The loneliness of the Arab is a terrible thing; it is all-consuming. It is already present like a little shadow under the heart when he lays his head on his mother's lap; it threatens to swallow him whole when he leaves his own country, even though he marries and travels and talks to friends 24 hours a day.\"Abu-Jaber whips up a troubling argument about the way American efficiency aggravates that despair.Sirine's uncle complains that in the US, \"people just talk all day long on their phone, their computer, and no one ever lays eyes on each other.\"A patron in the cafe asks, \"Why does no one in America recite poetry? They go to the coffeehouse and they just drink the coffee.\"As Sirine gets closer to Han, she comes to realize how starved he is for the sustenance of his homeland. \"I miss everything,\" he tells her in a moment of anguish, \"absolutely everything. The fact of exile is bigger than everything else in my life. Leaving my country was like \u2014 I don't know \u2014 like part of my body was torn away. I have phantom pains from the loss of that part \u2014 I'm haunted by myself.\"Slowly, she gathers pieces of his tragic history, his escape from Iraq and his family's ghastly fate under Saddam Hussein. Even knowing she can't fill that void, she makes an attempt, grasping after pieces of her father's Iraqi past, investigating Islam, and struggling to immerse herself in the political news she's always ignored.Han assures her, \"You are the place I want to be \u2014 you're the opposite of exile,\" but her uncle warns her that the cure for such loneliness is not so easy. \"When we leave our home,\"he says, \"we fall in love with our sadness.\" Indeed, the demons pulling at Han are stronger than she feared, and the novel begins to veer away from its comic tone toward the horror of Saddam's rule and the ferocity of America's response.At the same time, Abu-Jaber broadens her exploration of exile to include all the various ways we're bereft of home \u2014 by the death of parents, the separation from lovers, the hunger for lost childhood. Gradually, we come to see that every character in this story \u2014 Iraqi, American, and Arab-American \u2014 is banished by guilt, exiled to sadness by a sentence that can't be lifted by imperial decree or regime change.Abu-Jaber captures this despair with exquisite care, but her heart belongs to romance, not tragedy. The allusions to Othello that waft through the story eventually give way to the uncle's outlandish fairy tale. This is a tough time to consider the artistic and culinary beauty of Iraq, but as one of the cafe patrons says, \"Americans need to know about the big, dark, romantic soul of the Arab.\" Readers stuffed on headlines but still hungering for something relevant will enjoy this rich meal."}, {"userName": "Erin Riddle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/960078-erin-riddle", "userReview": "Diana Abu-Jabner\u2019s second novel, Crescent, explores the tensions, dynamics, and relationships among the people whose lives circulate around a caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles\u2019s Iranian community (often referred to as \u201cTehrangeles\u201d). The novel\u2019s primary narrative stems from the experiences of chef Sirine, who works at the caf\u00e9 cooking food based on her own childhood and family memories and recipes. She lost her parents young; they were Iraqi nationals who immigrated to the United States, but pursued numerous humanitarian missions throughout the world and died in Africa during a raid. Sirine was raised by her uncle and still lives him. Her life seems rather uneventful, until she starts to become involved with Han, an apparently sculpted Iraqi professor at the local community college. From there, the story unfolds around her romantic relationship with Han, with many dramatic twists and turns liken to an afternoon soap opera. Han seems to harbor a dark and mysterious past (with unidentified women), leaving Sirine to wonder whether she should trust him to be reliable and loyal to her. It is also worth mentioning that each chapter begins with a parallel narrative (as told to Sirine by her uncle, despite her boredom with the story and annoyance at his efforts) about Auntie Camille on her journey to find her rebellious son\u2014akin to epic Arab poems.I first picked up this title because I learned that Abu-Jabner is a fellow graduate of Binghamton University and native of Syracuse, and it seemed fun to read the work of a published fiction writer who found her beginnings locally. I was nearly finished with the novel before I started to check out some reviews online. Until that point, I felt that there was something I didn't like about the plot of this book and that really bothered me. The decisions the characters were making were too impulsive and irrational and they did not seem to fit with reality; I did not understand why they were making the choices they were.I stumbled upon a Goodreads review in which the reader noted that her edition included an interview with the author during which she identified Shakespeare\u2019s Othello as her model for this novel. This helped me to understand a lot about the novel. It made much more sense to me (and also helped me understand a little more the point of the parallel narrative that opened every chapter, which otherwise seemed disconnected\u2014and still does to an extent). Reflecting on Othello as a model explains the theatrical-like dramatization of the characters and their impulsive, irrational behavior\u2014yeah, I tend to read novels as if I were spying on someone\u2019s real life, unless I have reason to do otherwise. After reading the Goodreads review, I read the novel not so much as a novel, per se (whatever that means), but instead a mystical, theatrical dramatization in novel form, and from that point on I didn\u2019t seem to judge the characters as harshly. A change in perspective by changing the lens of which genre one expects to be reading can influence dramatically influence the way one reads and appreciates a text.Aside from the overly dramatic and impulsive behavior of the characters, the writing is overburdened with somewhat clich\u00e9d metaphors, similes, and analogies that strike me as characteristic of an emerging fiction writer\u2019s style. Or maybe the experience of having just come out of reading a John Irving novel (whose writing is packed with plot to develop characters and sparse with descriptive narrative\u2014a practitioner of the \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d strategy) influenced my expectations for reading fiction. Clich\u00e9s also abounded with what I found to be stereotypical portrayals of women and Middle Eastern or Arab people. Sirine as the main character seems obsessed with her love interest as it consumes her life, and when she begins to question his loyalty she starts to follow him around and imagines she sees him kissing one of his students\u2014the imagined arch-enemy who threatens to steal Han\u2019s love. Cat fight over a man? Come on! This arch-enemy conveys a strange choice in character development as well, as she is a woman who wears a hijab and seems to portray a eccentric sense of suspicion and militancy. The most enjoyable experience in reading this novel for me was how it weaved a space where multiple worlds and sensory experiences merge: multi-cultural community of Middle-eastern people and people interested in middle-Eastern cultures, academics (students and professors), working class, etc. converged at Nadia\u2019s Caf\u00e9\u2014also a space through which the novel intermingled food, music, dance, literature, and conversation (often contentious). There were also parts of the novel that successfully built tension and kept me engaged to continue reading and want to learn what happened. I did not feel any connection with the characters and their experiences, though I note that through the reviews I read it seems that many other readers did, and that they especially enjoyed the exploration of the transnational experience.For the reasons I already mentioned above, this wasn\u2019t an excellent read, but a good summer romance with a global socio-political slant. It did seem strange, though, that the novel did not offer more in terms of the reality of an Iraqi\u2019s (or any Middle Eastern\u2019s) experience in a post-9/11 America. The novel was published in 2003, so maybe it was written before then\u2014but the lacking in this area still remains noteworthy.) Even though the novel failed to leave a great impression on me, I know that many would enjoy Abu-Jaber\u2019s novel for all of the reasons I didn\u2019t. If you like theatrical and romantic melodrama in your novels with impulsive and irrational characters, this one\u2019s for you. Maybe if I went back and reread it through the lens of Shakespeare\u2019s Othello, I might appreciate it more, but I\u2019m ready to move onto my next read."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/309893-samantha", "userReview": "4.5One thing I love about Diana's books is they never go how you think they're going to, but in a good way.

I didn't fully understand why an Iraqi professor who is a famous translator, would fall instantly in love with a 40 year old half-Iraqi woman brought up in LA, who has spent her somewhat sheltered life with her uncle & the staff of the Lebanese cafe where she works as a chef. But I think the love story was secondary to the different stories of loneliness. Whether they are exiled from a country or from family and one another, most of the characters in Crescent are lonely people searching for one another.I like Abu-Jaber's writing style, which is warm & fluid. I like the way she entwined the uncle's stories, based in Arab myth & legend, into the story of Sirine & Han, along with the recipes & sensual descriptions of food & meals with family & friends. (I gotta try out some of these recipes!) The background characters, including the uncle, Um-Nadia, Nathan, Aziz, & Rana, were somewhat more interesting to me than the main characters. In fact I was positively impatient with Sirine at times. Snooping in your boyfriend's sock drawer, stalking him, flirting with his friends, & having public fits of jealousy, are not good girlfriend behaviors! The sympathetic portrayal of Arab characters & the details of life in Iraq, both positive & negative, are very interesting & make this book well worth reading, along with its sensitive insights into the meaning of exile from one's country.

One of my favorite lines that really doesn't match the mood of the book - \"I COMMAND YOU TO GIVE ME THE EGGPLANT!\" I hope to use this sentence in a conversation, soon!"}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1212245-meredith", "userReview": "I spent much of my time reading this novel in a sensory haze. The writing herein is plush, evocative, and sensuous. Sirine, Han, Nathan, and Aziz aren't always likable, but they exist on so many dimensions that we forgive them their flaws. The story, which might have been soap-operatic in less capable hands, is intricate, complex. One passage of particular interest to me, from both a narrative and feminist standpoint, comes when Sirine stumbles across some candid photographs of her and Han together. She muses, \"It is as though the whole of their relationship has been somehow invisibly noted and catalogued. Hans is the hero and Sirine the love interest\" (327). This is a jarring marginalization of self. Most of the story unfolds from Sirine's point of view, with a few brief forays into Han's past. It is interesting, then, that she downplays herself as a mere \"love interest\" when it is her character who drives the story. This is reflective of a larger insecurity that plagues her throughout--no matter how close she gets to Han, no matter how many men show romantic interest in her, she sees herself as simple-minded, inferior. Perhaps she can thank her parents--dead now, but neglectful when she was a child--for these issues.This book began as an exercise in sheer \"cover appeal\" for me. I have contemplated reading Abu-Jaber's Origin many times, but had never before seen Crescent on the shelf. It was a shallow choice that paid off. Crescent is a complex love story. It is a treatise on family. Perhaps above all else, it is a probing exploration of the Arab-American immigrant experience."}, {"userName": "Pamela Pickering", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/837540-pamela-pickering", "userReview": "I'm a little conflicted on this one and I'm not sure why. (Okay, I know why in some ways because I just wanted to throw the book across the room and yell AARGH!) The writing style was a little different. It was as if each noun required a descriptor (a little annoying at first). After I got the rhythm of the writing it went a little quicker. At some times I felt really invested in the characters (the writer wrote a passage regarding the lead character, Sirina, that seemed to be written about me) but then at other times I felt like saying \"I just cannot relate to these characters!\". Although I think the author meant to display the cultural differences of the mid-eastern culture I found such strong similarities in the mid-eastern characters to people I've known. Another irritation factor me: it seems to have that prevalent theme I am finding in many cultural stories, American culture bad; any other culture besides American good. I know the American culture is not perfect and has it's flaws but...come on! There was a lot of writing about food, so if you're a cook this might be a good choice for you. The author included a few recipes in the back of the book for some of the foods mentioned. I thought that was an nice touch. See, even my review is conflicted!"}, {"userName": "Alicia Aringdale", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19872238-alicia-aringdale", "userReview": "The book was beautifully written but I had a hard time making myself care enough to read it. It might be that this book simply wasn't for me, since it is focuses on an Arab-American experience which is not my experience. I guess I had hoped the plot would be more compelling but it was a very slow burn. Still I absolutely loved the descriptions of food, in fact I was always getting hungry while reading this book. I also appreciated a story where the protagonist was 40 and not married and everyone didn't act like her life was over because she didn't have a man. I enjoyed parts of the romance between Sirine and Han but their problems all seemed like they could have been fixed with better communication. So overall I liked parts but the overall feeling when I finished the book was not satisfaction."}, {"userName": "LadyKT", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5459330-ladykt", "userReview": "You have to read this book. I'm sure you hear this all the time, but honestly, you have to read this book. It was a class assignment in my college class Magical Realism and Women Studies. I liked the books I read in that class, but this is the only one I have kept and read and reread over the years. This book is truly magical. Sirine is unmarried, over 40 cook in a small middle eastern restaurant leading an uneventful life and living with her Uncle. An orphan, she lives in her own little bubble oblivious of everything including the adoring students of the local college. Her life changes when Han, a new professor comes into her life with dark secrets and a painful past. Now, if you know me, you know I don't do romance novels so let me reassure you this is not just a romance novel. It's a beautiful, complicated story that feels more like real life than you'd like. A bit of history, fantasy, magic, and cooking blend to make this truly something special. I thanked my professor for giving this story to me, honestly it has changed my view of story telling and what a good book can be. Read this book, it will leave you spell bound."}, {"userName": "Luna Selene", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4848441-luna-selene", "userReview": "I'll be thoroughly honest, it took a lot of effort to finish this book. I really had to push through it. I found too much of it contrived, and I really only got through it by the little chapter-opening stories, which turned out to be just as contrived in the end. The \"love story\" in this book quickly became overbearing, so much so that I generally became annoyed with the constant appearance of Hanif. I just really wasn't impressed by not only the writing, but the development of the story, and I can't say I've finished the 395 pages of my copy glad that I did. I'm honestly excited to send this book off to someone who'd enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Isla McKetta", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5723395-isla-mcketta", "userReview": "Sometimes you just want a book that's easy to read, interesting, and incredibly well-written.
