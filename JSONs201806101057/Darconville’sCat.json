Flinging ideas at the ever-patient partner about the dialectic of why a thought is what is thought, asking to be challenged because this book is seductive by nature and intellectual by design and how can a reader resist such a potent combination? Writing many opening sentences and discarding those, concocting a structure and burying it under a dense blanket of autobiographical rhetoric consigned to the bonfire of the vanity, and considering simply silence, as the excruciating riposte.

What a book!They don't write them like this anymore. Most of us have come across books that we adored and worshiped despite their flaws. There are those long books with some boring portions we are willing to forgive. There are books which we find more admirable than enjoyable. There are those where we have to give ourselves a pep-talk to make the difficult journey so we can eventually find the treasure. The Cat demands none of that forgiveness and apology. A pure pleasure to read - from cover to cover. There was not a moment when I wished it to be over, not even when it really was over. The Cat is full of riches - from comical satire to sublime emotions to abyssal darkness, all brought to life via eloquent and exquisite prose. The Cat is a tale of love and hate and of Darconville's obsession with love. Revolving more around Darconville's interior life than exterior, his consciousness and brooding thoughts slowly seep into the pages. His intensity is difficult to ignore, and at some point you find yourself living inside Darconville's mind, thus bringing him alive in your mind. All the while, you can imagine a quiet, subdued atmosphere, perhaps dimly lit by candles, with an old-timey smell. There is something haunting about it.The narrative rises in a crescendo with the entry of the antagonist, Dr. Crucifer. Despite his brief appearance, he easily joins the ranks of the most memorable characters to be found in literature. He contributes what must be the vilest and most intense tirade against the woman kind I have (and will?) ever come across. He is the keeper of The Misogynist's Library, the catalog of which is long enough to occupy 10 pages. Not impressed? Here, take this 20 page long formal oration on the subject. Not convinced yet? Here are 20 more pages of The Unholy Litany chanting the names of women he wants his soul to be saved from. And if all of this isn't enough, he gives you 10 pages worth of never-before-heard-of ways to torture and kill a former girlfriend. This is a character fully wrapped in darkness, the kind that can make a reader uneasy. But somewhere he crosses over from serious to ridiculous, to the point of appearing comical.Between Darconville and Crucifer, there is a satirical portrayal of the American South. There are numerous peripheral characters, often painted as hilarious caricatures. There are excerpts from literary works, prefacing each chapter. There is wit and scholarship at display everywhere. And there is that luscious prose (swoon!).I could read this book and rate it 5+ stars, for the prose alone. It's a great celebration of the English language. Pick any adjective of your choice for the best prose you've ever read, and it will, without doubt, be fitting here. It is the kind of writing that can cause you to drool, and render you speechless, rapt in admiration. There are many a sentences that make you want to read them aloud. Sure, he uses plenty of archaic words you've never heard of before, but it certainly isn't about showing off. It see it more as being about using the perfect word. There is a certain flow to Theroux's writing and despite the presence of difficult words, nothing about his sentences sounds out of the place. One can easily read through without knowing the meanings of the arcane words and still be fully engrossed. Whether you decide to read it with or without the knowledge of the word meanings, be sure to enjoy the sound and the rhythm of Theroux's writing. Immerse yourself in his words and let them wash over you.________________________________________Book-jacket Trivia: The portrait of Darconville on the cover was painted by Theroux himself.________________________________________Vocabulary: If you are reading or planning to read Darconville's Cat, you may find the following link useful:http://www.goodreads.com/story/show/3..."}, {"userName": "Nathan \"N.R.\" Gaddis", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7607437-nathan-n-r-gaddis", "userReview": "Recent bloggish-review of The Cat in which some of you good goodreaders get yourselves quoted and a tip o' the hat to someone [sic] who looked up every godsdamn oversized $10 word.\u201cDarconville\u2019s Cat\u201d: The Power and Glory of Vengeance Writ Fantastically Large, by Stuart Mitchner, 21 Mar 2013: http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2...________________My review will be a bit delayed, likely until I revisit our Spellvexit story.Meanwhile, the vocabulic efforts of MJ, Megha, Ali, and myself is available under My Writings, a not-thorough annotation of big words and Therouvian word mastery: http://www.goodreads.com/story/show/3...If you find yourself in difficulties about locating a copy, which should not be a difficulty just yet until Ali's flaming therouvianism gets truly out of hand and dries up the entire non-collectors market, there is what should be a prime bit of therouvian word and language love forthcoming in February 2013, The Grammar of Rock: Art and Artlessness in 20th Century Pop Lyrics._______________To my merriment I have not run across the word \u2018masturbatory\u2019 in any goodreads review of Darconville\u2019s Cat, although we well know this word has popped up in reviews of other Theroux books and books by other very smart people. To call an author of Theroux\u2019s talents \u2018self-indulgent\u2019 or \u2018masturbatory\u2019 is the abyss of stupidity. Onanism is the terrible core of creation:Away with a prose squeezed free of the real!

Our earlier judgement concerning the despair in reading of a prior reader may well have been simply mistaken. The Committee, as a preliminary finding, would recommend that, even for book buyers in the habit of buying only clean, unmarked books, consider purchasing a well marked, annotated and underlined exemplar, being as this novel lends itself well to entertaining previous readings.______________\"Nothing exceeds like excess.\" -- Crucifer______________\"Anthony Burgess chose Theroux's Darconville's Cat as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. It contains multitudes. It is a story of love, obsession and revenge -- and it is a story and celebration of the life of the English language -- all styles of writing and demotic species are incorporated in its vast body (I speak of the book at its near Proustian bulk, and of the language). And, it is as funny as anything you'll ever read in your life.\" - Ben Waugh.\u201cIn his dazzling, invective-filled novel Three Wogs, Alexander Theroux noted (in an afterword of sorts) that he has \u2018a very amplified prose style,\u2019 and he spoke of \u2018the leisure, the languor, necessary to art.\u2019 It's clear that the language Mr. Theroux has employed in his own books is closer to that of such writers as Dickens, Sterne and Corvo than to the minimalist offering of his contemporaries; and [all his work] demonstrates a love of verbal pyrotechnics and an instinct for the grand. In the same essay quoted at the beginning of this review Mr. Theroux wrote, \u2018Writing is life become art, not simply the random copy made out of one's dishwatery day or diary or panfurious whims. It selects, must do it beautifully.\u201d - Michiko Kakutani.\u201cWhat's best about Darconville's Cat is the advantage Theroux takes of the tradition of The Book, the large storehouse of knowledge such as The Bible, Gargantua, or Moby-Dick. Elaboration is all. The reader who doesn't care for a chapter on college girls' late-night rap sessions or the dialogue in verse between Alaric and his beloved Isabel or a classical oration by Crucifer can skip ahead or back without losing essential continuity. There are learned disquisitions on love, hate, and the human ear; wonderful odd-lot lists; Shandyian japes such as a one-word chapter and a page of asterisks; and Swiftian renderings of small-town southern life, ranting religionists, academic foolery, and much more. The parts are all related but don't disappear into a whole, into an illusion of reality.\u201cDarconville's Cat is boring and brilliant, both puerile and profound, self-indulgent and often cruel. Theroux lacks Thomas Pynchon's interest in this century and the popular humor of Gilbert Sorrentino's Mulligan Stew, the novel Theroux's most closely resembles. \u2018Madness,\u2019 Darconville says of a book very like the one in which he is a character. But like that excessive anomaly of the 1950s, William Gaddis's The Recognitions, Darconville's Cat should find a dedicated following, readers with an appetite for ambition and literary aberration, for a prodigal art that, in Darconville's world, \u2018declassifies.\u2019\u201d - Tom LeClair ."}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "Darconville's Cat is what I would clearly call maximalist fiction. A basic summary would not be enough to describe why - The plot is threadbare, and without the luxurious prose style it would be bizarre - a young naif intellectual falls in love with a poorer college student. The whole affair is based upon idealism and projection, and he is of course heartbroken when she leaves him for a big-eared sailor. At Harvard, he is inducted by a Coptic eunuch into a bizarre and disgusting litany of revenge. Horror of horrors, he writes a book about her. What makes this book so large and contain such multitiudes is the luxury and overexertion of the prose style. Theroux's diction is theological, baroque, chemical. Fingernails are the color of potassium permanganate and the moon is bulgarious. There are lists of lists of things. Lists of imaginary places as romantic vocations, lists of names invoked as enemies, lists of books which justify hate. The book itself is a duality. The first section of the book is a laughing and slashing satire of college administration and little southern towns. Then when Darconville moves to Harvard, the place is run by what I would call a demon. What petty mistakes are held here are far overshadowed by the evil which Darconville meets and succumbs to.There is another dimension which was pre-eminent to me - the balance and rapid slide between love and hate. Darconville's feelings towards Isabel are not really what I'd call love, but mere pity and infatuation, where he falls in love with his constructed image of her. It is an idealism of not knowing. After he takes lessons in misogyny, he falls into a course of ridiculous and exorbitant hate, hate overcompensating for his own flaws and omissions. The 'misogynists' library' demonstrates to me that this hatred is from 'knowledge' and is well-credentialed, or that misogyny has a long societal tradition. At first you can laugh at the little lives and foibles in the beginning, but there is little else which is funny after. The book falls into hyperbolic, consuming, awful, ugly hate. It seems apparent to me that Theroux cannot possibly endorse these actions, but a portrayal of what hideous things are within.This book would never really become a best-seller. The reasons are obvious. Too big, too complicated, too avoiding of a cut and dry plot resolution. But I can also imagine another secretive cabal, one devoted to its care."}, {"userName": "Garima", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7915003-garima", "userReview": "[at first sight (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee", "userReview": "Twenty years ago I worked in an antiquarian bookstore in Boston (JP), wrapping and shipping rare books and lugging mail bags to the post office for $7/hr plus side benefits like learning at least the titles of so many interesting books, running the side of my hand along the signatures of so many immortal writers, being introduced to Shunga, and experiencing the sort of restlessness and depression that comes from working in a generally closed-to-the-public antiquarian bookstore located in a place where it's usually cold from October through June. I worked with an older guy (35) who spent his day at a computer describing and pricing stacks of books. He loved incunabula and fishing and dreamed of hosting a TV show in which he fished and talked books (their form, not so much their content). One afternoon I asked this older bibliophile for suggestions on what to read. He was only ten years older than I was but already seemed more or less middle-aged -- he was graying and wore a jacket and tie to work every day and had quit drinking and found God after surviving immersion in the '80s East Village NYC poetry scene -- he occasionally mentioned some connection, possibly amorous, to Ginsberg. He suggested Elias Cannetti's Auto-da-F\u00e9, John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, Thomas \u00e0 Kempis's The Imitation of Christ, and Alexander Theroux's Darconville's Cat. I acquired three of these four. Read half of the first one but wasn't into it, read all of the second one but wasn't into it, read nearly none of the third one because I didn't want to quit drinking and find God, and couldn't find the fourth one at the time. Years later, I found an inexpensive first-edition hardcover, I'm pretty sure for $1 at a thrift store, of Darconville's Cat that included this letter from the publisher: https://ibb.co/h2V4UG -- the Cat was there on my shelves for years, always enticing, always something I stayed away from, maybe because I wasn't all that into the bookseller's other recommendations. On here of course I encountered so much love for Theroux that my eye always returned to its spine when I wondered what to read next, but not until mid-November 2017 did I finally start it -- and find myself pleasurably surprised by how much I loved it. Oh I should have read this twenty years ago, I thought, really enjoying the ridiculously high-flung style juxtaposed with the simplest teacher/student love story set in rural Virginia spatially and doubly dated temporally in what felt like the early 1970s but also a sort of Dickensian 19th century thanks to the scrim of language o'er it all. The vocabulary of course revealed delights when I looked up the words and so often found them not only not neologisms but also perfectly descriptive. The characters were finely drawn and ridiculous but memorable. The whole thing fizzed along through its first 200 pages as love bloomed and the figure of Darconville, so out of place in the place he found himself, his plight expressed in such high language, negotiated new love and old-school academia. But then what happened? The story began to turn as the relationship with Isabel became inevitably complicated. There was a stint in Charlottesville so the author could describe Charlottesville and its inhabitants, a stint in London so the author could describe London, more of a sense of estrangement as Darconville tried to capture the feeling slipping from him via marriage, and then a stint at Harvard so the author could describe Cambridge and introduce a nefarious concoction known as Dr. Crucifer, so perfectly named, a diabolical misogynist eunuch, but ultimately for me where my attention and affection for ye olde Cat pretty much died out. By page 450 to 500, with 200 more to go, I just couldn't stick with Crucifer's rants and I didn't really believe in or care for Darconville or Isabel or any of it. The story seemed too simple, too stereotypical, dressed up in excessive language and ideation and reference in a way that I had little patience for. I skimmed for plot points and paragraphs that didn't repel my eyes with thickets of fireworks. Like my reading experience of Gravity's Rainbow, the book seemed to transform into a hose of prose opened all the way and aimed right between my eyes. In moderation, revved-up language is all the rage, but over 700 pages, in this, I found my experience of the reality of the situation and the characters and their emotions undermined. I tried to commit to extended sittings and be patient with the book but I found myself falling asleep or not really caring or discovering the delights (I certainly wasn't looking up words anymore) when I did keep my eyes open. My rating therefore mostly reflects my love for the opening 200 pages and my affection up to page 400-- I ultimately failed the final 300 pages, despite Dr. Crucifer's efforts to bring me back into it. The book is a celebration of excessiveness -- and I partied with it up to a point, after which I started to fade and wanted to switch to water (I kept eyeing a collection of Richard Yates stories) and head home. I don't think I'll get to my copy of Laura Warholic or, the Sexual Intellectual anytime soon, although I am glad to have a better sense of Mr. Theroux and can cross the Cat off from the list of well-loved masterpieces recommended to me long ago that I can't really say I unconditionally loved."}, {"userName": "Stephen M", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3712181-stephen-m", "userReview": "Sitting there, turning the pages, Darconville nevertheless found one particular aspect of the treatise disagreeable\u2014its misogyny. That bias rose like a poison fume from almost every paragraph, and Darconville, who, even in his early teens, had been somewhat scandalized the first time he read it, was no less so now\u2014and, possible for being in love, more. How he wondered could anyone hate women?A Portrait of the Philosopher as a Forlorn LoverIf Joyce took the english language to extremes never thought possible, and Pynchon dissected the paranoia of a post-war world, and Wallace brought out the connection between addiction and entertainment, then Theroux\u2019s contribution to the encyclopedic canon would be an examination of misogyny and its close relation to romantic, idealized love. Owing stylistic debts to the Victorian era novels\u2014with its elevated prose, plot twists and melodrama\u2014Darconville\u2019s Cat is, if nothing else, a wonderful thing to read on the sentence level. Within the first few pages, Theroux provides a devastating critique of life in isolated areas of the south and the religiosity that permeates in the region that the book takes place.It was a little world unpardonably misled by fundamentalist drivel, a stronghold of biblicism, and one drowned in the swamp of its execrable simplicities. Nowhere could be found anything in the way of adornment. It was a place that liked its coffee black, its flapjacks dry, its adjectives few, its cheeses hard, its visits short, its melodies whistleable, and its dreams in black and white\u2014preferably the latter.Almost every page features this type of piercing judgement. While they make for an engaging and sometimes hilarious read, they also work with an overall conceit within the novel that concerns itself with the problematic relationship between philosophical thinking and human interaction. The free-indirect style is a function of the main character, Alaric Darconville, an intellectual of academia who falls head-over-in-heels in love with one of his students, Isabel. Darconville bears such a close resemblance to his creator, that parsing the differences between intentional and unintentional personality traits imbued in him, and their subsequent significance in the novel, would be an exercise in futility. Judgements, of the type excerpted above, are often intertwined with postulations about philosophy and direct references to famous philosophers\u2014Plato and Kant especially. The writing is infused with analysis and critical examination as directed against those unlucky enough to fall under Darconville\u2019s judgements. There is no doubt that philosophy, as a field of study and practice, takes as its defining characteristic to be critical thinking and a dependance on the foundations of logic. Whether intentional or not, the novel applies the practices of critical thinking and analysis to all aspects of Darconville\u2019s relationships with paranoiac intensity. Darconville overhears a conversation where a man says that \u201cno Quinsy girl could ever love\u201d. Darconville\u2019s love, Isabel, is a girl who attends Quinsy college, so Darconville spends the whole night (a whole chapter in the book) working out a sixteen step argument to try to assuage the fear that Isabel might not love him. And when not relying on strict syllogisms, Darconville bides his time analyzing everyone around him (in an negative, degrading way\u2014as it seems sometimes the trajectory of philosophy aims). Anyone of Darconville\u2019s temperament can relate to the discomfort of an overstimulating social situation. The presence of other human beings, causes him the extreme discomfort that all introverts struggle to overcome and Darconville automatically resorts to his defense mechanism, over-intellectualization and analysis, a mechanism which Darconville becomes acutely aware in a rare moment of honest self-reflection. But the majority of his interactions go as follows:This particular party was characterized by that mood of horrid democracy one so loathes; disparate factions didn\u2019t separate but actually tried to relate to each other\u2014and while old farts, trying to dance, flapped about like wounded birds, self-assured teenagers\u2014in whom confidence is such a vile characteristic\u2014pontificated above the noise about politics, careers, and money-schemes.It is unclear what argument, if any, that Theroux makes against the usage of philosophy in aspects of personal relationships, but it is apparent that the majority of this book relies on such a wealth of philosophical lingo that it makes the association between Darconville\u2019s actions and the role of philosophy that much stronger. In another move of philosophical self-defense, Darconville dissects the otology of the word \u201cfun\u201d when Isabel says that she never has \u201cfun\u201d with him.The value assigned the abstract notion (Fun) in this rigorous proposition, while it may seem only putatively factual, actually extends itself here to a philosophical calculus of common truth-functions beyond ostensive definition. . . to the suggestion of an unsubstitutable and immutable absolute (in life) by which, had it never been uttered, the straightforwardly empirical protocol established in the pursuit of sufficient linguistic assessment might otherwise be distorted.The book rides on the weight of western thought which, as evidenced by selections from Dr. Crucifer\u2019s Misogynist\u2019s Library, is absolutely male-centric and oppressive of women. It may not be the true that Theroux is decrying logical thought entirely but he makes it obvious that the type of mind that Darconville has\u2014high-brow intellectual, logical, and ultra-sensitive\u2014is susceptible to the erroneous, misogynistic thinking that the character Dr. Crucifer embodies. We are exposed to a painful bout of rhetoric-infused word dumping in which Dr. Crucifer propounds the virtues of hatred and the degradation of women. The entire speech bears a remarkable similarity to an essay written earlier by Darconville on Love. Thus, we see the strong connection between Love and Hate, that they are not just the flip-side of the other but so intricately tied that they become one in the same. The heavy emphasis on misogynist rhetoric may leave many with more than a few qualms with the author and his intentions of such liberal usage of hatred towards the \u201cother\u201d sex. A good chunk of its usage can be subsumed into this conceit about the history of western thought and the usage of \u201clogical\u201d thought in trying to make sense of volatile human emotions but much of the misogyny seems in excess and lacking in the justification that our moral conscience craves. But I don\u2019t think any book exploring misogyny would be doing its job if I wasn\u2019t offended at some point in the narrative. That, added with the fact of the intentional fallacy should prevent anyone from completely hating the author for his aestheticization of misogyny. These qualms are bound to arise any time that someone writes a story as male-centric as Darconville\u2019s Cat. The strengths that this book exhibits far outweighs this potential flaw and the book gives enough substance for any reasonably thoughtful person to chew on and struggle with.Despite the thematic weight that this carries, the book remains multifaceted and finds time\u2014in proper maximalist fashion\u2014to explore a wealth of various topics in different writing genres. The book is stuffed with lists, poems, prayers, telephone conversations, \u201cunholy\u201d litanies, essays, arguments, rants, syllogisms and Shakespearean blank verse in play format. Much of the novel celebrates the english language and excavates the OED for nearly every word imaginable. Dictionaries are required and an etymological knowledge of greek and latin roots is recommended. Some paragraphs rip through vocabulary left and right and Theroux is not shy about making up words to fit the rhythm of a sentence or compliment the sounds of the adjacent words.Regardless of any vocabulary pretensions, Theroux has an impressive command of narrative and narrative-delivery. His sentences are often long, but they never feel run-on. The wind was up and the pale undersides of the few leaves left on the trees were layered to windward as, frantically, Darconville set off on the run to find a recording machine\u2014across Langdell, over to Paine Hall, into the science Center, and then cutting back through the Yard he found one upstairs on the fifth-floor of the Lamount Library where, conveniently, no one was about. The librarian pointed to a machine. Darconville tore off his coat, clicked the tape into place, and\u2014holding his breath\u2014pushed the button to play.Many will be surprised by how fast they can read his chapters as they are often plot-centric and aim for suspense and excitement. The first four hundred pages could be published on its own as a quality romantic novel. And what\u2019s so unique about Theroux\u2019s addition to the encyclopedic novel is the straight-forward narrative and limitation of characters. Anyone familiar with the novels in the canon are well-aware of the demands it can make on the reading w/r/t character, plot threads, and shifts in style. Much of this book is flat-out fun to read.Theroux muses on writing frequently and makes sure to sprinkle aphoristic, one-liners throughout.The present tense, he thought, overflows categories of past, present, and future and drifts into the unreal, timeless realm of ideation.When love isn\u2019t proof of itself, it is suddenly impossible to prove\u2014and words, which fit to fill the mouths of myst and mummer alike, cheapen on the tongue.In short, this novel is extraordinary in its ability to communicate and for anyone who has a love of great writing, this book will fill their heart\u2019s content with its mellifluous prose and deft descriptions. But for anyone with commitments against the problems inherent in a male-centric society and a male-centric tradition of philosophical thought, they may find a lot of the morally questionable aspects of the novel lacking in justification and lacking in a direct refutation of its presentation in the narrative. Regardless, Darconville\u2019s Cat deserves a place among the literary greats that tackle the difficult issues; it ought to be argued and dissected by the fans and detractors of such literature, literature that does as it should: push its readers to think, push its readers to feel."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward", "userReview": "\"That night God and Satan fought long hours for his soul.

Darconville\u2019s Cat is at once an ode to love, and its indictment and trial, its prosecution and defence. Through the promised heights of love it delicately drifts, yet it exposes with force its hidden correlates, and descends to its darkest depths. It examines the interplay between love and hate, life and death, art and suffering, and in the process exposes these antonyms as inseparable counterparts. The story is at once thrilling, tender, strange, unsettling, absurd, poignant, shocking, profound, immense, silly, pretentious, immersive, illuminating, surreal, bizarre. The writing is incredible.

Probably one of the best reading experiences I have ever had. The man is a genius. Must read it again, many times. Reading Alexander Theroux is like reading a reincarnation of Edgar Allan Poe with a vast knowledge of words; I say this because they both have a lot of melancholic issues surrounding their writing, or so it seems from reading  Darconville's Cat and Poe's poetry. They both dwell on women, and why not, women are great, and a lot of good sentences/lines of poetry are born from the dwelling on them. Theroux had a good blend(best way to put it?) of admiring a woman and being disgusted by a woman, and the shift is interesting to read. Crucifer was a very good villian. I enjoyed his interactions with Darconville a lot. While reading these sections, sometimes I felt bad for liking him so much, but he was so clever. The description of his voice was hilarious, and I could almost hear it behind me as a read:\u201cThe voice was a soprano\u2019s, with a little glub-glub sound in the throat like a coffee boiling in a percolator, but there was a piping up higher in his birdlike syrinx, as if in a dry whistle it were fluting through a beak. It had no timbre, not at all what one would expect from such a big man, a hovering, elongated man. And, what, was that an accent? Mere phrasing? A glottal defect?...\"\"As Dr. Crucifer continued speaking, the words in the darkness seemed disembodied, hanging in the air.\u201d Now imagine how that sounds with these words from Crucifer himself, \u201cI have imagined us together having tea on a dark afternoon with oatcakes and double Gloucester and then a late stroll on the misty common to give our swordsticks an airing.\u201d Then after the he says this all to Darconville he adds \u201cAlone.\u201dTheroux's lexicon is amazing; I wish I had an 1/8 of the knowledge he has. From the little that I have read about him personally, I would like to talk to him, even though he would probably only use language that I would just have to sit and nod as if I know what he is talking about.

His work done, he absconds out the window\u2014our dashing Icarus\u2014and proceeds to screw the literal daylight out of the Sun. The resulting eclipse comes to us in the form known as Darconville\u2019s Cat.Listen: nothing I can say here will add to the superhuman efforts that Nathan, MJ & Co. did a few years back. All I can add is my two cents\u2014namely, that this novel is testimony to the idea that another\u2019s beautiful mind can enliven your own. Darconville\u2019s Cat is emphatically not a challenging read, insofar as you are willing to meet the author halfway. This is a book you get lost in and are thankful for it. Its reputation as \u2018challenging\u2019 is, in my unasked-for opinion, wholly fallacious and only the byproduct of hobgoblin hiveminds who sting themselves to death at the idea of a book that\u2019s over 700-pages long and doesn\u2019t have the words\u2019 game,\u2019 \u2018of\u2019 and/or \u2018thrones\u2019 in its title.You know the abysmal term \u2018mindfuck?\u2019 Well this isn\u2019t one.

Ever. The running jokes (Elizabeth I and suboptimal female thigh-to-frame proportion) are gifts that keep giving. The first 200-pages will have you in stitches and unguarded for Theroux dropping science on your ass in the form of a 20-page thesis on the ontology of love that rivals some of the greatest philosophers and theologians I\u2019ve ever read. This will then happen in the form of explications on other Big Things throughout the remainder. The results, otherworldly. The mind, blown. My thesaurus, exhausted. But, as I said, I really don\u2019t have much to add.

They come together, they come apart, and at the bitter end of the relationship he tells her he'll have the last laugh: he'll immortalize her immoral ways in a novel! \"Do your worst,\" she says. Oh, he will. Oh, he will. The nerd ignotas animum dimittit in artes and produces a 700-page tome packed with words no one has used in centuries and populated almost entirely by grotesque caricatures -- except of course for its handsome, brooding, sensitive, brilliant protagonist and (before she falls out of favor) its surpassingly beautiful heroine.If the book you're picturing is a vanity-published disaster that reads like an extended version of this, I don't blame you. But in at least one iteration of the above story -- there have probably been many -- the result has been a legitimately good book. A really good book. Surpassingly, unbelievably, \"did someone sell their soul to write this\" good. \"Burst out laughing on the subway in a socially inappropriate manner because of just one phrase\" good. \"Remember vividly the moment you first decided staring at bound wood pulp for hours was fun\" good.The word that best describes how Alexander Theroux writes in Darconville's Cat is vigorous. His range extends from vicious satire to near-embarrassing panegyric and can switch between the two at high frequency without jarring the reader, because unlike so many misanthropes and cynics, his spite comes from the same well of energetic intensity that also fuels his moments of approbation. He isn't an enervated, jaded critic, celebrating only in that which does not pass his stringent threshold for annoyance; he's the kind of guy who experiences love and hate symmetrically, as states of energetic activation, reasons to write furiously until the sun rises. This book crackles with electricity. It goes to 11. The smallest motions of feeling are amplified into pages and pages of self-possessed lists and disquisitions and dramatic monologues until every other modern novel begins to seem wimpy by comparison.Theroux's subject matter is mundane: a campus love story in the rural American South. A lot of writers would use such a premise as an opportunity to portray small subtleties and gradations of feeling and to observe that there's worth even in lives with no great dramatic resonance. Not Theroux. In his archaic style, unembarrassed by its own grand rhetorical gestures, love becomes Love, hate becomes Hate, and this story of a college professor and his girlfriend becomes the great Book that swallows all other books. Which might seem bathetic until you remember just what intense love and intense hate -- the book's two symmetrical subjects -- are like (in any context). Capturing emotion is not just a matter of subtlety; it is possible for one's microphone to distort the loud notes even as it picks up the quiet ones. Theroux's style befits his material. As one memorable character says: \"nothing exceeds like excess.\" Melodrama? Megadrama!That's about all I want to say, except that this is a good book, that you should read it, and that it's really not all that difficult to read (the funny words all make sense in context) and way more entertaining than anything this obscure has any right to be. (Why aren't they selling this kind of thing in airport bookstores? I'd buy it!) There's something else I should go into, though: the presence of misogyny in the book.If Darconville's Cat has any kind of notoriety, it's for a set of chapters near the end in which a particularly deranged character goes on a set of misogynistic tirades, sometimes for over 20 pages at a time. With a less extraordinary novel I would simply be able to assure you that this character has nothing to do with the author's own perspective. We all know that Nabokov is not Humbert. It is harder for me to make this kind of judgment of Darconville's Cat precisely because of the autobiographical content I mentioned at the beginning of this review, and the vigorous writing style I've been praising for the rest of it.Theroux's writing, which often seems to strike away from irony in its pursuit of intensity, leaves me unable to determine where the narrator ends and Theroux himself begins. Should I simply avoid speculating about Theroux's private life, and imagine the narrator only as an abstract and polemical adopted persona? But given that the university in Theroux's book is reported to be directly based on a university where Theroux himself taught, it is hard not to ask, when (say) presented with a long scene in which a set of college girls have a lewd, catty and incredibly vapid bull session: is this how Prof. Theroux viewed his female students? When Theroux himself has said that the novel served as a kind of therapy after a bad relationship, am I really not supposed to think about the relation between the particular romance presented therein and the views held by its creator?What I am getting at here? The famous rants, bad as they are (I would say \"too bad to be taken seriously\" if only their brand of excess were not so close to the one embraced throughout the book), are put in the mouth of a character who is not only repulusive but unsubtly coded as demonic. I shouldn't read the views of a Bad Guy as those of the author, right? But the book is, I'd argue, more subtly misogynistic long before that. It contains not a single female character who does not conform to one or another sexist stereotype. That includes the over-pedestaled, under-characterized heroine, who is so thoroughly passive and without intellectual substance that, when the Bad Guy starts to talk about how she's essentially a void or lack with nothing at her spiritual core, it's hard not to feel like the whole book has been leading up to it. The Bad Guy's explicit misogyny is rejected by the narrative voice, sure, but an implicit version of it lurks throughout the narrative. Theroux presents us with a parade of bimbos and bitches, then gives us an explicitly misogynistic character and says, wait, don't be that guy! Meanwhile, the character in question talks on for scores of pages in something that sounds very close to Theroux's own voice, and the book still does not contain any woman who can serve as counterexample to his generalizations.In short, I'm not convinced that Alexander Theroux is not a misogynist. Maybe he's not a misogynist on the level of some of the stuff that appears in his book. But he might be the kind of guy who prides himself on rejecting that stuff while succumbing to its milder alternatives. I recognize that some other Catters might get Mad at me for suggesting this. Well, so be it.My real point, if anyone is still reading, is that even if Theroux is a misogynist, that doesn't make his book bad. This is not a foregone conclusion: pseudo-rational bigots tend to produce bad art. They flatter themselves for clinging to generalizations, claiming that their tendency to think in general rules and principles (all X are Y) reflects a rationalistic or scientific tendency, when spurious generalization is really one of the most commonplace and pre-rational gestures of human thought. It's the easiest thing in the world to see one example of an X that's Y and casually induct to the \"principle\" that all Xs are Ys. It takes much more care and intelligence to recover what it was we actually saw (a single X that was Y, and also probably Z and A and B and many other things). A writer who trusts his own incautious generalities will only give us the sort of thing we're already used to thinking (and, hopefully, rejecting).Theroux is not that writer. He is a great observer of the mind's mistakes, and, crucially, never signs on to any view of them except that they happen. Even as he gives you rules without counterexamples (as with those female characters), he mocks the way his characters leap from examples to rules. Does this tendency have an exception when it comes to his own thoughts? I honestly am not sure. But then I suspect that much about Alexander Theroux will remain a mystery -- a delightful mystery -- to me for some time."}, {"userName": "Jonfaith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "userReview": "A bonfire was then lit under a huge pole, and on that pole a huge banner, to hysterical applause, was suddenly unfurled and upon it, upsidedown, were written the words: \"In The End Was Wordlessness.\"I recall contacting my best friend Joel when marvelling at the rich depths of The Recognitions.

Does our hero Darconville really make good use of this insight? Other reviews here have noted the extreme misanthropy and misogyny that courses through these pages. The other most notable feature of the book is of course Theroux's defiantly baroque style. These two qualities, arguably, are related, as language becomes a means to escape or heap ridicule on the world. Style is everything. The plot is threadbare and other than Draconville and Crucifer, characters do not really exist except as pretexts for rhetorical savagery. It may be telling that the title refers to an animal. At least a cat has the advantage of not being a human being. I like to think I'm a humanist, so all this was not particularly my cup of tea. And yet the writing - my god, at its best Theroux's prose gives off such a heady rush of freedom, this sense of the infinite possibility of words.

Of the latter I can certainly vouche. The former could not have been accomplished without some deep seated experience. After all, this is a novel about love and hate. But it also concerns poles of every variety. As Nietzsche pointed out in \"The Birth of Tragedy,\" the interplay of Appollo and Dionysius give birth to tragedy and fortunately for us in this case also to comedy. \"The Trojan Horse has foaled.\" For in this Proustian synthesis of Theroux, genius clearly resides. Saul Bellow once wrote that fewer than 20,000 people had the intellectual wherewithal to really understand his novels. I suspect that in the case of Theroux the number is roughly half. Hence, booksellers consider this work an \"overlooked masterpiece.\" The vocabulary is fairly daunting --the longest word in the world can be found within this magnum opus. But the pure wit and the rare sagacity and the beauty of the language is absolute paradise: this is one of only a half-dozen novels that I envy to the point that I wish I had written it. This is a novelist's novel. \"You will either build a bridge or build a wall.\" In some cases the rich syntax rivals Proust in length and in other cases it's simply pithy wit. Theroux captures the dialect of the South deftly in his Blue Ridge Faux Eden and then revels in his own element East of Eden in the Hahvid Yahd. There are many places where I just laughed my head off. His primary cast -- Darconville, Isabel and Crucifer -- are memorable and the vitriolic diatribes of the wicked Crucifer must have been good fun to write. Crucifer out-Mephistos Mephistopheles as a worthy arch-demon as purely Satanic as any demon of Milton, Faust or Dante. This Crucifer is Biblical and leads Darconville on a tragi-comic chase through the labyrinth of his soul with an ending that is both original and intriguing in its wisdom. Thus Theroux prophesized his own manuscript going into a tin box to be confiscated by a Philistine doctor to offset his fees. This book takes a while to read properly -- I would advise you not to rush it. The writing is exquisite -- really it's as good as it gets in our day and age -- so just be sure to savour it. I also recommend that you buy this book as an investment: someday soon this genius will be \"discovered\" as an overnight success a mere 30 years in the making and his first editions will be worth great fortunes. \"Darconville's Cat\" is a pure joy to read -- it is, honestly, simply perfect."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "\u201cDarconville, the schoolmaster, always wore black.

To say I loved this book would be a lie, but it's possibly the best book I've read since I first read Gravity's Rainbow or Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. This is GAN material and I can only hope that, with time, Theroux will be read with the care and dedication of his predecessors.This review adds nothing to the beautifully thought out pieces already written about the book featured on this site, but I do want to add one thing that struck me about this book: It is written in such an amazing way that is basically outside of influence. It's post-modern as if modernism never happened.

Besides the main text which tries to sort the Cat into the tradition of Maximalism, Encyclopedism and the Menippean Satire, I hope that the appendices will be of use to some. The first appendix features an around 80% annotated bibliography of the Misogynist's Library, the second an almost complete breakdown of women (and four men!) in the Unholy Litany.Original review below:*************************************After 9 1/2 long months, I finally finished Darconville's Cat today. Not because it was bad, but because it was that good. There is no other book since Ulysses which had me under it's spell as this book. It is, more or less, the perfect book. There are several reasons for this: 1. The language. This is most likely the first thing one will notice about the Cat. Theroux is logorrheic and verbose to the highest degree. At the same time, this is what makes the book so precise. It's pure bliss for a non-native speaker to be thrown into such an enormous amount of new words. I must have looked up more than a thousand words, most of them filling a small notebook I used exclusively for this novel. 2. The form. Theroux plays with a number of forms and literary traditions: Sonnets, lists, travelogues, diaries, litanies,... Some of the chapters serve both as reading guides as well as a form of mental logbook - a game of what the reader already knows and make sense of. An example for this is the car trip Darconville is on (LVIII: Over the Hills and Far Away): he lists up hundreds of places, real and invented. Three chapters dealing with Dr. Crucifer are similar: LXVII. The Misogynist's Library (nine pages of books dealing with misogyny), LXXXII. The Unholy Litany (names and allusions to hundreds of women, complete with the formulaic repetition \"libera nos, Domine\") and XCIII. \"Why don't you-?\" (just as many ways of torturing Darconville's ex-lover, Isabel Rawsthorne). These four chapters alone amount to days and days of research, even in 2014. 3. The characters. I loved most of the characters. They embody certain stereotypes through their names, as well as their linguistic idiosyncrasies. President Greatracks and Dr. Dodypol were my favourites among the minor characters. Dr. Crucifer on the other hand is, well, one creepy fuck. His speeches were both the most complex passages in the novel, as well as some of the best; while other passages bored me to sleep. All in all, Theroux manages to evoke some brilliant characters. I would not advise to read this novel if you want a good story. The Cat is extremely boring and cliched in that aspect. Treat it as a cerebral and exceptionally well-crafted piece of writing instead. It's a shame that almost no one knows about this novel, but that can be changed. I really need to reread this in a couple of years."}, {"userName": "Aiden Heavilin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65067206-aiden-heavilin", "userReview": "The trees soughed in several rushes of night wind, blowing as if off an invisible sea upon which sailed only that which sailed, was meant to sail, and meaning nothing more, and Darconville, imagining himself, the while, at some point in the future recalling this particular moment, found it restful to think that somewhere some things existed without significance, without dreams, without memory. But that was memory, wasn't it? And what had memory wrought of joy? Memory wounded. We must free what we are in time, he thought, from memory and live toward the future which, second upon second, made memory irrelevant even if it increased its size.We begin our symphony with a few dark notes, grim and mysterious, suggesting more than they show.Darconville, the schoolmaster, always wore black. A kind of requiem, perhaps, foreboding and gloom drenched. Antique, almost quaint. Death knocking on the door. And yet soon lyrical beauty enters, a melancholy progression between minor chords. September: it was the most beautiful of words, he\u2019d always felt, evoking orange-flowers, swallows, and regret. From there the music grows stranger. A modern style enters, unafraid to utilize new instruments and contemporary writing, and yet it is juxtaposed to an old-fashioned symphonic brilliance that flowers occasionally into plumes of rapturous iridescence. And sculptured Aphrodite, in loose-flowing alb, stepping slow and fragile under the loops of dripping ring willows, puts a finger to her lips, shakes out tearshaped petals from her flasket, and then holds high her holy lights which silver and bewitch the common wood where two, long asleep, sweetly wake under the baldric of a new heaven to blush at the silence, pause, and faintly hear a goddess whisper in a voice lower than leaf-fall: \"Tomorrow shall be love for the loveless, and for the lover tomorrow shall be love.\" In short, Isabel Rawsthorne looked up and smiled.For a while, it remains steady and beautiful, with breaks of sarcastic, satirical brass stabbing.\"Potato,\" observed Prof. Wratschewe, graciously bowing a cup of punch to his colleague. \"Did you ever stop to think that if 'gh' stood for 'p' as in 'hiccough'; 'ough' for 'o' as in 'dough'; 'phth' for 't' as in 'phthisis'; 'eigh' for 'a' as in 'neighbor'; 'tte' for 't' as in 'gazette'; and 'eau' for 'o' as in 'beau'\" - he snapped out his ballpoint and scribbled on a flattened cup- \"then the correct spelling of potato would be ghoughphtheightteeau?\" He looked up smiling.  As the music continues, it grows unsteady, it wavers. Ocassionally, it seems the floor drops beneath its feet, it plunges a second towards despair, hurtling, hurtling until it catches itself, and reinstates a damaged steadiness.And then the darkness arrives. The low bassoons growl, the trombones stutter, the tubas blare in groaning warning. Evil materializes within the music. Hatred appears in all its raw bitterness. Yet the beauty resists it, blooming up out of the gloom in order to defy it a moment, fight back until the terrifying moment when it is drawn under, and submits. \"My child,\" whispered Dr. Crucifer. And the darkness reins supreme. Strings rise in dissonant runs, timpani thunders in apocalyptic darkness beneath, brass bleat and stutter, woodwinds shriek overhead. A powerhouse of malice thumps engine-stroke upon greasy engine-stroke.\"I want a platter - listen to me - and I want a head on that platter! inaction itself must otherwise assume the proportions of a crime. I see a demon behind you standing in the midst of her own noise, the biology of whose shadow cannot and will not be studied! Examine it no further! But there is a reality pitched above that shadow. It's yours alone to feast on in ill-will! Stand upon her- and prevail, overcoming the hound that bays and rejoicing only that you've lived to say, 'The dog is dead!'\". The evil becomes so grotesque it is almost laughable.Yet at the end... Remember. The beauty swells up one last time, to dispel the shade of that darkness to the far corners of creation. Yet the price that has been paid, the damage that has been done. Lyrical loveliness cannot prevail. The music becomes desperate, it becomes tragic, it is filled with regret and longing. It seeks only to illustrate what was before it is gone. It reaches heights of emotion one might think impossible. When there seemed to be nothing left, he slept, then rose again to write - no, not with an elevation available at will, but through the whispering of innumerable responsive spirits within him that stirred like the invisible motions of the mind wavering between dreams and sleep to remind him that out of fatal mortality could be snatched something in the life of the world that did not participate in disintegration but could transcend it. At the end, it is a Pyrrich Victory. The music concludes with notes once more grim and mysterious yet tinged now with a recognition of the nobility that existed within the mystery all along.Sorrow is the cause of immortal conceptions."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew", "userReview": "You may be intimidated by a 700+ page tome riddled with obscure phraseology, some of it clearly dug out of the darkest depths of the OED (multi-volume library edition, not the big one, unopened naturally, that adorns your Republican aunt and uncle's living room, thank you very much), some of it clearly sprung forth from Theroux's brain.

Although the future of this planet is already and buried in digital bellicosity, this one actually comes close, and theoretically/lyrically transcends Moby Dick. This is a masterpiece and an literal linguistic, structural universe unto itself. A linguist's feast. Suggest purchasing the hardcover wit Theroux's etching placed first and forward. It would be impossible to not come across at least 500 new words in half as many pages. It is a tough call; how inventive is this book? Well, to begin at the beginning, perhaps it is not coincidental this text is virtually unknown, while Infinite Jest at least made the Top 100 English Language Novels of 20th Century list etc. Perhaps Wallace's well-known critical addictions and psychoses pushed him forth, perhaps it was the footnotes. Infinite Jest was one of the greatest reading experiences of my life. Don't get me wrong. Yet Darconville's Cat is something more of a deadpan, Gothic work of equally genius invention. Why even bother with this theoretical prognosis{{?}} I am thinking out loud. What has been done to the English language in the past 40 odd years? Little, save defamation. Ridiculous posers like Zaza Something and John Franzen write worthless novels for worthless readers. Their literature is not intellectually different than the Europeans and Americans who travel to Bangkok in order to see children get raped on a live stage. Theroux has no use for every BA's favorite psychedelic cornball, Pynchon. While Pynchon and the rest fade into tombstones entitled Temporary, Darconville's Cat is an inventive masterpiece which will be read for centuries. Perhaps by too few; yet who have you spoketh with lately who mentioned Job or Ezekiel? Perhaps you were playing Candy Crush Saga. Go fucketh thyself. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++Note to the note below again on that mendacious orange star:Having read that and returned up here for air, I admit with sorrow that I will be unable to finish Darconville. It is one of the books I have to return to the library today or tomorrow, as I am leaving the East Coast and returning to the Bay Area on Wednesday afternoon. I will be leaving behind my entire library (In good hands) save a book or two, as I travel so lightly I will be bringing little more than some notebooks, pencils, pens, clothing, and the other things that come in trial size. Also, two manuscripts at most I am not bringing a computer, and so I have just now, as I'll be leaving Newark in less than 48 hours, realized I will not be online much at all. I have chosen now to live on the run, put my books I have been obsessing over for nearly three years in solitude and despair, and return to life, and my friends, and the California sun. The east coast and all of its comforts have let me down. I need to be poor again, living on foot and surviving off of bread, coffee, water, and wine, and cherishing life without much technology, and just a little bit of love, and cheer, and being unable to even pay my library fees, but being able to turn a phrase, fall in love, embrace life by any means necessary. For anyone reading this, I have a feeling I will write a temporary farewell blog post only alluded to prior, as the reality of this cross-country voyage had not hit me yet. Now it has. I shall return in more ways than one.NOTE: For whatever reason, every other time I reload my home page Darconville comes up as 'Read' with one star. It is a glitch slowly driving me insane and I'm not going to clear the thing another 45 times. In the case anyone is curiouse, this is my first time reading this, and the rating is a glitch._______________________________________________________________________Well, the time has come. Betwixt us, dear reader, I was so out of the loop on this one that when I picked up the beautiful first edition hardcover today and took a stroll on the bus through the pages, a serious energy tore through me. The greatest thing is that I have no idea what this is about, but that everyone here and in the other world had not too long ago switched this one, for me, from 'Really should' Read to 'Seriously have to' Read. Also picked up a brand new NYRB edition of The Go-Between for two bucks. Anyway, looking forward to this evening and night. Time to crack this one open once and for all. I may be late to the party, as everyone here is dead asleep in their clothes, but there is a piece of stale Italian bread on the table and a caraff of burgundy leftover. I think I saw a hidden Chimay in the back of the rerigerator, behind the green cheeseburger.
