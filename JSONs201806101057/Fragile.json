Some of her thrillers have thrilled me totally and some have just meandered along. This one meanders. Basically it is just another small town mystery involving small minded people who all have sad lives and dislike each other. I have never personally lived in a small town and I hate to think that places and people like this actually exist outside novels.That apart the book is an okay read, a little too long for itself but reasonably well paced and with a good story line.

Working from her home office as a psychologist, she was mostly happy with her life but feared the constant anger between Ricky and his father would only get worse. Ricky was a typical moody teenager but it often seemed to Maggie that Jones constantly criticized his son which made Ricky surlier.But it was when Ricky\u2019s girlfriend Charlene disappeared that the horrors started. Long buried secrets from the past threatened to collide with the present \u2013 the parallels caused Jones to turn his thoughts inward and become more reticent which of course had Maggie worrying herself sick. The people of the town were divided \u2013 standing together over Charlene\u2019s disappearance, but there were those who held their thoughts close to their chest. As the search escalated, Jones and his offsider Chuck knew time was running out. And they didn\u2019t expect there would be a good outcome\u2026Fragile by Lisa Unger is a slow paced thriller which I enjoyed.

I didn't know anything about her and her books when I started to read Fragile, so I had no expectations. Now I wish I had known what to expect, because I wasn't in the right mood to read a \"depressing\" book.This story takes place in a small town called The Hollows, where everyone knows everyone - or so they think. Their peaceful - aka dreary and hopeless - suburban lives are shaken when a teenage girl goes missing. Has she run away or has she been abducted? Why? As the news are spread around town, the memories of a similar case that happened two decades earlier resurface - and long-buried secrets can no longer stay hidden. The parallels between the two (past and present) cases seem to affect everyone's life, and no one will be the same when all is finally said and done.I had a hard time reading this book. There were too many characters and the POV shifted constantly from one to another. It was annoying, because I didn't need to be privy to the thoughts of every character that made an appearance in the story. Some of those POV were redundant, repeating what I'd already learned from other characters' POV, and some were completely unnecessary, adding nothing to the story. Anyway, regardless of their importance, all characters were connected with Jones Cooper, the head detective at the Hollows Police Department, and his wife Maggie, a psychotherapist who added a few wrinkles to my forehead due to her lack of professional ethic. Jones' and Maggie's POV were the ones who kept the story going and Ms. Unger could have ditched the other characters' POV - but that's just my opinion...Besides the too-many-characters issue I just mentioned, I also had a problem with their characterization. I mean, there wasn't one single character who was slightly content in this story. Considering how many of them there were, it was depressing to find out that none of them knew what happiness was. Oh Ms. Unger, just slash my wrists and be done with it, will you?As for the mystery/suspense part of the story, it was dragged too long for my taste, but it had an interesting plot twist near the end. I suspected knew that things weren't exactly what they looked like in that sleepy little town, but I hadn't figured out what exactly laid beneath the silence held by Jones & Co.The ending wasn't to my liking either. Everything was wrapped up too neatly, which was unrealistic and disconcerting. The ending did not fit the overall story, that's all I can say without giving it away.Based on what I wrote above, one might assume I disliked this read. Well, I didn't dislike it - but I can't say I quite liked it because it depressed the crap out of me. Strangely enough, that's also the reason this book has its merit, as I don't think Ms. Unger was aiming at delivering an uplifting story when she wrote it. So, all things considered, I guess I could say this was an okay read to me. I'm just glad I'm not one of the depressing characters in this book."}, {"userName": "Lauren Fidler", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2072335-lauren-fidler", "userReview": "i know. i promised myself i'd never unger again.i lied.let's just face it. an unger novel is perfect for those pre-bedtime creepouts. she weaves convoluted plots that feel simultaneously unbelievable and close-to-home. here, it's the tale of two dead girls, separated by decades, and the question of what would you do to protect the ones you love.jonesin':1. for once, unger's multi-perspective drama didn't feel uber-contrived to me. i got into the rhythm of the novel easily and it was addictive.2. tone: it's creepy. i wanted to double check the locks on all my windows and doors after reading. it's not something about which i would say, \"YES! I need to read more books like this so that i can live in abject terror for the rest of my life!\" but i think she was successful in creating the intended atmosphere. and i respect that.3. story: of all the ungers i've read, this one i liked the most. there's something harrowing about a missing girl that makes me think of the 80s in the worst kind of nostalgic way. i flipped the pages the same way i glued myself to the television, looking for updated news of missing children, fearing the worst, hoping for the best. whatever the best may be.trippin':1. the names. blech. jones cooper? two last names is hardly effective at conjuring anything other than a downeaster in a flannel jacket. sorry. 2. female author in a male brain. or male author in a female brain. i don't like it. it has to be done carefully and cautiously, with respect to the gender. but here unger's internal conflict reads like the stereotype. ricky has all the predictable angst worthy of a teenage male goth (\"It's Rick, Mom!\"), jones is doughy, passive, and broken, and charlie is...well, charlie is number 3.3. charlie: okay, i've said it before and i'll say it again. i really don't like it when authors create a fictional author self. here, it's charlie, the writer-cum-exterminator. his story is probably the weakest and obviously he is, in all ways but the penis, supposed to function as the counterpart for unger (who tells us in the epilogue about how she was personally haunted by a missing girl when she was in her teens and how she wanted to write about it but couldn't find the words). blahblahblah. charlie had potential, but it was squandered when he became a literal representation of the author herself.4. maggie: maggie is ricky's mom, jones's wife, marshall's therapist, melody's high school buddy, elizabeth's daughter...she's connected to almost all of them (not charlie, though, i guess it bears mentioning). i hated her. she's very condescending her role of therapist and she plays only to the stereotype. plus, she pimps therapy on EVERYONE, and, i'm not saying they don't need it, but it felt a little cheap and a little hollow.5. marshall, travis, and the chief - this unholy trinity of abusive/abused males permeates the text in a way that feels altogether overplayed. they're 2-d representations of a sensitive subject matter worthy of some deeper consideration. oddly, while reading, i totally imagined christopher plummer in the role of the chief. off-putting, that.3 star effort here - a good story mildly undone by the cardboard rigidity of its characters."}, {"userName": "Melisa - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42481357-melisa---traveling-sister", "userReview": "\"How do you know if you're a good person or a bad person?\"Fragile is a slow, well-developed, character driven tale.

Charlene leaves home and everyone assumes she is a runaway, yet the adults remember another time, back when they were Charlene's age and Sarah Meyer went missing. Are the cases as similar as they appear and if so, will anyone be willing to bring up the secrets of the past? Fragile is filled with an almost dizzying array of characters yet author Lisa Unger masterfully sorts through each one and the history behind the characters showing how small their community truly is and yet how many secrets have been and continue to be kept. The characters are well described and realistic, the plot is quite brilliant, with enough twists to keep the reader turning the pages looking for the next piece of the puzzle.

Somehow this just didnt come together for me, a shame since it started with such promise. Good points are these: the writing is extremly smooth. Unger is undoubtedly a deft writer. I flew from one page to the next. Missing teenage girls is a premise I keep seeing over and and over again--in fact it's beginning to grow tiresome--but this seemed to offer more than the usual fare. Somewhere toward the end of this novel,though, the plot just fizzled for me. The villain characters just seemed over the top. The \"good\" characters didn't ring true. The solution to the mystery of the second missing girl and the aftermath seemed to strain credulity while the first missing girl plot line felt cliche. I had to finish, but I found the end result unsatisfying in a way I can't wholly articulate.

NY Times bestselling author \u2013 aren\u2019t they all? I am not sure how I ended up going out with Lisa since she seems to mostly be read by women. Fragile doesn't seem to be quite chick-lit but, if it is, I don't hold that against it. Lisa Unger says on her website: \u201cMy novels center around strong women who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances, and explore themes such as the power of a single choice, the corrosive nature of secrets and lies, dark family legacies, and the secrets we keep from each other and from ourselves.\u201d Source: http://lisaunger.com/biography/ If you seek a book with thrills and a happy ending, \u201cEureka!\u201d You have found it. I should probably say that it is an unlikely happy ending. Unlikely is an adjective that can often be applied to thrillers, I am finding.I am sure that there are clever things that could be said about Fragile. The thing is, though, the book packs so many morals to the story in the last dozen pages, I just don\u2019t know which one to highlight. So let me just give you a string of perfectly satisfactory end-of-book thoughts and you can take your pick.Henry found himself wondering why people held on to anger and sadness, gripped it tight, let it dictate the course of their lives, but found it so hard to find and keep love.. . .Because it mattered how well they loved one another, how well they treated one another as a family \u2013 that was the root, that was the trunk of life. All the rest was just leaves that grew and fell, were raked away and grew again.. . . There was a story Chuck\u2019s father used to tell about the boy who spread a rumor against a good doctor in the town where he lived. When the boy went to make amends, the doctor asked him to cut open a feather pillow and let the wind take the feathers away, then to come back the next day. When the boy returned, the doctor asked him to collect all the feathers and put them back in the pillowcase. Of course, it could never be done. Those feathers had been carried far, alighted in places where they couldn\u2019t be seen or found but stayed there just the same. . . . You\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t. It\u2019s one thing to try and fail. It\u2019s another thing to never try at all. That\u2019s the stuff that eats you alive.. . . \u201cMy husband used to say, \u2018The past is history. The future is a mystery. The present is a gift.\u2019\u201d. . . It was all woven together in one great tapestry \u2013 the past, the present, the future \u2013 colors and textures mingling and entwined. It was nearly impossible to extract the present moment from what came before it, from what might lie ahead. . . . \u2026 she felt an awe at how all their separate lives were twisted and tangled, growing over and around one another, altering, aiding, and blocking on another\u2019s paths. Not just her family but people who seemed so distant . . . And how the connections between them were as terribly fragile as they were indelible. I am tempted to use the word \u201ccorny\u201d to describe the ending. It manipulated my mind into a sentimental framework and I seemed unable to avoid the mist forming in my eyes in spite of my intellectual effort to denigrate my emotions. Fragile said the obvious \u201cLife is complicated\u201d and I was glad to be reminded.I found this book by chance and will probably not seek out other books by Lisa Unger. I already have plenty of mysteries on my shelves to read. In the Author\u2019s Note at the end of the book she says she has been trying to write this novel for twenty years. She says, \u201cA lifetime ago, a girl I knew went missing.\u201d She did not mimic that life experience in writing this book, but it made the emotion real for her.The \u201ccorny\u201d factor keeps me from giving this book five stars.

Charlene's disappearance reminds the townspeople of a similar case over twenty years ago where another teenage girl disappeared. Her body was found weeks later and her killer put in prison. Will the past repeat itself in this small town?This book was billed as a thriller. I would call it mainstream fiction. I listened to the audiobook which took about ten hours.

It's been done a thousand times...Certainly the book started very slowly, and there was not much happening at all. Many pages were expended on establishing who was who, where, what and why...Then, at some undefined point, I realised I was definitely enjoying this book, because it was diverging from the typical, and was actually a fresh approach to the time-honoured standard. As things turned out, I read Fragile quite quickly because I became engrossed.What impressed me about this book was that the emphasis was not on the actual crimes but on the impacts of those deeds and actions on the people involved. There was very little of a forensic nature, or of police procedure. The unnatural deaths that occurred in the book had basic descriptions, but no elaborate, high-drama action sequences. The focus in this book is on the psychological aspects of crime. What was going on in the mind of the perpetrator? What circumstances had brought about the crime? What were the impacts on family, friends and the community? How did those involved get on with their lives afterwards? Who had regrets and why?There are astute observations about the way people think collectively in a small town. Even if the comments have no basis in reality, the group-think can have huge consequences for individuals, both in the way they are treated by the community and within themselves.This is very much an examination of the psychology of belonging vs isolation, of loving vs dysfunctional families, of honesty vs deception. It looks unflinchingly at issues like selfishness, emotional manipulation and narcissism. It examines individuals\u2019 moral values and ability to live up to ideals, ability to cope with disorder and disappointment. It also looks at issues around acceptance and forgiveness, and around coming to terms with terrible things that have happened. I found that this style of story engaged with me on an intellectual level. My main criticism of the book is with the structure. There are multiple character voices, scattered throughout a non-linear narrative. Normally I don\u2019t have a problem with this style of writing, but in Fragile I found myself being confused at certain points - who\u2019s point of view was I reading, and at what point in time? The story jumps around a lot, with no warning. This detracted from my reading enjoyment.My minor criticism is that certain characters, psychologist Maggie Cooper in particular, tended to be excessively wordy and repetitive.

It was a pleasant surprise and a very generous gesture, especially since the original giveaway book arrived shortly thereafter. Theoretically, then, it probably isn't necessary to review the book but feel it is appropriate.I faithfully read page by page to Ch 19, page 190, almost halfway through the book before, out of sheer boredom and impatience, I flipped to the back of the book to find out how it ended. The first chapters introduced the reader to a mishmash of characters, mostly the classmates of the main character, the Police Chief, and his wife, a psychotherapist in a small town, The Hollows, not far from New York City. I couldn't decide if it was in the Hudson River Valley, New Jersey or Connecticut--it was sort of a indistinct any small town, but not really. I've lived in several very small places in NYS and in Vt and could not get a feel for this fictional place, there was no atmosphere.The characters, except, perhaps the teens were very one dimensional as well. Even the former school principal with whom I should have been able to relate, having been in secondary education all my life, was colorless.The missing teen girl, sexually assaulted, was presented in triplicate and felt too contrived and artificial. I could not really feel an urgency or empathy to any of the situations. There were some twists and turns but again they seemed too drawn out. I did go back and finish the book but wasn't moved by any of the neatly resolved issues. In fact, I'm still not sure what purpose Charlie and Wanda served in the story at all.

My theory is that so many books fall apart when crimes are committed for a couple of reasons. One: the tree of possible consequences branches wildly at such moments and, Two: authors rarely have first hand experience with the material they are writing about; in fact, the experience is usually several generations old and stale and filtered through other books or television. These two elements together add up to somewhat of a mess to slog through. I eventually put the book down even while I was still feverishly turning pages (skimming) just to get through the damn thing.As a bracing counterpoint to this phenomenon, I suggest The Talented Mr. Ripley which, in my opinion, COMPLETELY holds together through not just one but TWO complicated, unusual, spontaneous murders; not just the motivated behavior of those directly involved with the action, but also the web of investigation, anger, horror, disbelief and policework that goes on around it. HUGE kudos to Highsmith for pulling that off from cover to cover. That novel was just the first of her Ripley series, but really the best, and possibly the only one worth reading.

The book is about the disappearance of 2 teenage girls, one in present day and the other 20 years ago. Fragile reminded me that parents had lives before their children and they have secrets, they could have bad secrets. I enjoyed that the novel was not specifically about the teenage girls, but about how those around them are affected by their disappearance even 20 years later. There was a lot of characters in the novel and I wished that Unger had made it more obvious which character was talking and if it was the past and the present (something at the beginning of each chapter maybe).

Lisa Unger's Fragile is one such book.I could say that Fragile is the story of a young girl's disappearance. That it is about small town secrets, or families cracking apart . I could say that because it is all of those things. This book kept me up nights telling myself \"just one more chapter\" . It's a suspenseful story set in a small town outside New York City where many residents have lived their whole lives. The kind of of town where almost everyone knows everyone else. One night a young girl leaves home after arguing with her mother, only to never come home that night. What begins from there is a sequence of events that bring back memories of a similar event 20 years earlier and how it affects those involved. Did she run away, as she stated on her Facebook status? Or was she taken by someone out to do her harm. I don't like to give away too much of a story in a review because I don't want to cheat anyone of of the mysteries and answers I had the pleasure of discovering myself. I will tell you Fragile is not the first novel I have read by Lisa Unger, and it certainly will ot be the last."}, {"userName": "Janene", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4943024-janene", "userReview": "This book was frustrating.I didn't like how it flipped from past to present to past to present with no warning whatsoever. I also didn't like that I was always trying to remember who someone was in relation to someone else. I understand that we were suppose to be getting the idea that it was a small town and everyone is connected but it was REALLY confusing. I live in the small town that I was born into and I do know a lot of people who know a lot of the same people I do. It's true that small towns have that quality to them. I just feel like it could have been done with a few less characters - but I'm not sure who I would get rid of, either.Anyway - I was frustrated because of the things I mentioned above (which made me have a difficult time reading the book) but also because I HAD to finish it! I was interested in the story and actually felt a tiny connection to some of the characters. I needed to know what happened. I didn't LOVE the book. I was annoyed by the vague hints that something big was in the next few chapters...but I guess it worked because I finished it. I did think that the book got better as it went. It was just \"ok\", though. I might recommend it but wouldn't put it on my \"favorites\" list."}, {"userName": "Msjodi777", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903985-msjodi777", "userReview": "This is another of those books that you just keep on reading because you can't believe what is happening, and you just have to know how it turns out. I did like it, plot, while a little contrived, is actually believable, characters grab and hold your interest. So, yes, it was a good book. I did get a bit confused, because you changed point of view from one person to another, and it was not always clear right away who was speaking, but I did get used to it, and was able to follow along as more and more of the story became clear. Narrator, Nancy Linari, was excellent. <><"}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8887111-denise", "userReview": "Fragile by Lisa Unger is a story about family, secrets, murder, abuse and facing the past. When you begin reading this story you may be slightly overwhelmed by the number of secondary characters ( town residents, Ricky's girlfriend, her family, police) . Quickly Unger builds a multitude of characters and begins showing how they link together with the main characters. The small town of Hollows is full of secrets and unusual characters.

Ricky's father Jones is the lead detective on the case but Maggie sees anxiety and vibes not quite right in her husband.Multiple characters and a story and a mystery murder that went almost unsolved thirty years ago is remembered when Sarah a classmate of them all went missing, and then later her body was discovered raped and abused. Why these two very different cases are linked and how they are linked is the story in this book. Long hidden ghosts in one's past dont stay hidden and in this case they certainly dont. It will tear apart the entire town, outlining a past that all of them will prefer to remain hidden. Though dormant it has affected all of them and not in a good way these past years.
