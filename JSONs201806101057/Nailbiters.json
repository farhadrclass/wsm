There were a few typos but nothing that distracted from the story. I love how the setup of the book kept our character ambiguous for a little while, but I enjoyed learning more about Dora and her past. The detail (such as the descriptives in the very first gas station raid) was impeccable. I look forward to reading more books by Ms Williams, especially her short story collection. Thank you for sharing your work with us."}, {"userName": "Debbie Williams", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30097135-debbie-williams", "userReview": "An alien story that keeps you in suspense from beginning to end.

I can def say that I haven\u2019t read anything like this before. While some books contain a sweet story that makes you smile, other books actually change the way you see the world. Nailbiters changed the way i see the world! Well, i am a Psychology major, so i\u2019ve always questioned the world and the way people behave, but this book gave me so much insight into a very real outcome of humanity, if invaded by Aliens. I think the author did a spectacular job portraying how different personality types would response to such an event. In most invasion stories, the town or country gets thinned out but a group of strong humans work together and eventually emerge as victors against their oppressors. The ugly side of humanity is only shown to the extend of a looted store or maybe one psycho person. Nailbiters goes way into this darkness and shows many ways in which humans could be cruel if they thought they could get away with it in a situation of widespread choas like an invasion. I just loved how human nature was such a big part of the story.The book itself is written kinda in diary form from Dora\u2019s pov and follows her as shes gets into worse and worse situations. She is a strong character but def gets used and abused along the way.The Ending = Mind Blown. It was that good. The book actually comes with a disclaimer saying to stop reading if you don\u2019t want to know the ending. I considered this\u2026but yeah right, i had to know\u2026..and yes, mind blowing. The ending was great and i really feel like i\u2019d like to know more about this world and the aftermath!!Overall, i have to say that i loved this book. I can definitely say that i'd probably make different choices that Dora, but for creativity and storytelling, this was an A++. I would definitely recommend this for older readers who enjoy Alien/Invasion stories. I def wouldn't categorize this as young adult or appropriate for young readers. There are many older themes (rape, murder, graphic violence, etc) introduced in this book, so read with caution if those things bother you. I loved it though, and while i usually stick strictly to YA, i'm really glad i read this book because it really made me think, esp the ending. I am really looking forward to other books by this author."}, {"userName": "Christy Aldridge", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50371382-christy-aldridge", "userReview": "Nailbiters is a top notch novel. Simply amazing. It starts with a bang and it ends with one. If you're into books that drag you in, hold you close, and keep you biting your nails even after the final word is written, Nailbiters is for you. M.K. Williams is beyond talented."}, {"userName": "soztheo.me", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31871817-soztheo-me", "userReview": "What do you do when the world has gone to Hell?

Williams\u2019 ability to balance the action with Dora\u2019s internal struggle to rationalize this new sinister world adds depth and meaning to the story and makes the reader question what people should be willing to do to survive.
