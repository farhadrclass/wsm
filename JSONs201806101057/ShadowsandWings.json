It stirred a cauldron of emotions, a brew so complex I can\u2019t identify all the ingredients. But I\u2019ll give it a try.First \u2013 a disclaimer. I got the book from the author in exchange for an honest review, but I was apprehensive before I started reading. This novel is literary fiction, and I don\u2019t usually read literary. More often then not, literary opuses bore me. I\u2019m a genre reader. Fluffy romance and magical escapades are more to my taste, but despite my preferences, Tulk\u2019s novel gripped me from the first page. It wasn\u2019t an easy read but it held me in thrall and wouldn\u2019t let me go until the last screen on my Kindle.The plot is compiled of two interweaving lines. One is the story of a young woman, Lara, growing up in Australia in the 1970s. Although she knows that her beloved grandpa Tomas is German, she never associated him with the atrocities of the WWII until he died in 1994 and she found an SS lapel pin among his few keepsakes. Was her kind grandfather a monster? A war criminal? Unable to believe it, she nevertheless needs to discover the truth. With her thoughts awhirl and her emotions in turmoil, she travels to Germany to find out. The second plotline tells the story of Tomas, from his childhood in the 1930 in a German village, through his maturing as a student and a young musician, playing cello for the Berlin Philharmonics, while Hitler rises to power and Nazis march across Europe, to his years as a Wehrmacht soldier after he was drafted. Raised by his free-thinking luthier father, Tomas doesn\u2019t approve of the Nazi ideology. Neither does he rebel. When he is conscripted into the army and sent to the eastern front, he kills \u2013 the enemy soldiers and the civilian Jews. No shots are fired on the pages, no battles described, but the reader is privy to Tomas\u2019s troubled thoughts, his grief and his shame. Tomas knows: if he doesn\u2019t obey orders, he wouldn\u2019t survive. Like so many in those times, he conforms to stay alive, but after the war, his conformity haunts him. Wrecked by guilt, unable to wash the innocent blood off his hands, he can\u2019t stay in Germany, can\u2019t play music, can\u2019t forgive himself. Self-hatred drives him to immigration. And although he manages to build a new life for himself in Australia, he never plays his cello again. The novel jumps constantly between Tomas\u2019s and Lara\u2019s POVs, throwing the reader from the past to the present, from Tomas\u2019s pre-war and war years and his tortured conscience to Lara\u2019s search in modern Berlin and her quest to find herself. The structure is a bit jarring, and some of its elements, like Lara\u2019s childhood years, seem totally unnecessary, slowing the pacing and weakening the overall story arch. Multiple musical allusions don\u2019t enrich the story either. Instead, they clutter it, as do the author\u2019s frequent and overly long descriptions, lyrical but extraneous. The novel would\u2019ve been better with some tightening. But all those faults are small compared to the huge and controversial theme the author dared to tackle: the communal guilt of the Germans after the war. From the war veterans to the youngsters born decades later, should they all keep the memory and the guilt alive? Or should they forget and move on? After all, none of the living Germans participated in the Nazi\u2019s evil. In the book, Lara\u2019s new friends, students in Berlin in 1995, discuss the issue: \n\u201cPeople think at the back of every German is a Nazi, just waiting for the moment to come out and shoot them.\u201d\u201cIt sucks,\u201d Annika added, twisting the stem of her wineglass. \u201cYou are not aloud to be proud of being German.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Jacquie agreed. \u201cThat is dangerous. Patriotism is dangerous.\u201d\u201cGermany is a thing of the past,\u201d Zak said sagely. \u201cWe can never lose the Holocaust. It will always be here. We are always being reminded. \u2026 We will never be forgiven.\u201d \nSo much bitterness and anguish and pride in being who they are \u2013 grandchildren of the German soldiers. Should these kids suffer for the sins of their grandparents? They didn\u2019t choose to be born there. They didn\u2019t do anything wrong. How much backbone does the country have to remind its citizens again and again, with every generation: remember! How much courage does it take to acknowledge publicly and loudly, for the entire world to hear: We were wrong. We are sorry. How deep a conscience does such an acknowledgement require?As I read, I felt compassion for those kids. My heart ached for Tomas, for his tormented soul. He was clearly a good man. Was he guilty if he killed under orders? He blamed himself, but should I blame him? Or others like him? Were only his leaders responsible? Neither the author of this book nor I know the answers. Only questions remain. But I know that no matter how the guilt is assigned politically, on the personal level, I can\u2019t forgive and forget. Almost against my will, I blame the Germans, all of them, for the Holocaust. I\u2019m Jewish. The Holocaust touched my family. Both sets of my grandparents survived the war: they evacuated. But my grandmother\u2019s relatives stayed in Moldavia when the Nazis came. None survived. The old folks, the women, the children \u2013 everyone perished.Could something like that be forgiven in theory? Strangely enough, in practice, I don\u2019t feel hatred towards the few Germans I\u2019ve met. They are nice people. For example, there is this girl, Gaby, a charming student from Munich. For the past few years, she has been coming to Vancouver every summer to volunteer at our Jewish library. Why does she do it? Why spend every summer at a small, boring local library instead of some exciting vacation adventures with her friends? I asked her once. She said all the right things: the different culture, the new continent, the English immersion. But I can\u2019t rid myself of the notion that she is trying in some way to atone for what her great-grandparents did in the war, even though she has never met them. She is the fourth generation. Her grandparents were children when the war started. What drives this girl? Does she carry the guilt for the war like a gene? In the Tulk\u2019s novel, Lara\u2019s friends mentioned that visiting the sites of the death camps was part of the school curriculum for every German child. Is it still true, I wonder? Has Gaby seen Auschwitz? Could we all benefit from such a long memory? The novel asks many questions but doesn\u2019t answer any of them. I guess it\u2019s up to us to discover the answers for ourselves.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Claire McAlpine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528841-claire-mcalpine", "userReview": "Parallel stories, Lara, a young woman wants to know more about her Grandfather after his death, knowing nothing of his family in Germany, he immigrated to Australia in the late 40's, the only clues a few personal objects.Two young boys growing up in a village in Germany, trying to stay out of the way of local bullies, Tomas, the son of a repairer of musical instruments and Gustav, his best friend. Patriotic to their country but wary of the new regime, they must navigate their late adolescence with care.A wonderful story, I especially enjoyed the lives of the two boys, dealing with life on a micro level and then paralleled as they become young men. For one the past is too much to bear, he wishes to put it behind him, for the other it is impossible to move on.Much to reflect on, but I recommend this wonderful book for an alternative view of war and reconciliation.

She tells of a young Australian girl's search to discover the story of her grandfather's life in Germany before he emigrated to Australia after WWII. Moving between present and past, Germany and Australia, and the perspectives of a loving granddaughter and a young man who only wanted to play the cello but was caught up in the sinister sweep of evil, Shadows & Wings is an unflinching portrayal of the human drive to understand, accept responsibility, and forgive."}, {"userName": "Kirsten", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5727892-kirsten", "userReview": "Shadows and Wings begins showing Lara as a young girl living in Australia and her close relationship with her Opa. Tomas, Lara's Opa, moved to Australia from Germany after World War II, but his early life has always been kept secret from his family. Until he dies, that is, and Lara receives a box with various items that hint about his past and she decides to try to learn the truth. The story begins with Lara, but then has a long section in the middle that is told from the point of view of Tomas as a young man, and then back to Lara. The book starts off slowly and although it is beautifully written, I was getting a bit tired of Lara's story initially. Once the focus shifted to Tomas's story though, I was hooked. This book was the best of all worlds, being well written, and an interesting page-turner, and also meaningful and giving you something to really think about at the end. And that boring beginning section? Once I finished the book I found myself wanting to go back and re-read that whole section in particular after everything I learned about Tomas to get a new perspective on how all of his experiences affected him in his new life in Australia. I would highly recommend this book. I feel like sometimes, if a book is published independently there is a bias where you think well, it wasn't good enough to be picked up by a major publisher. I can state that this definitely is not the case with Shadows and Wings. From other reviews I saw that the publishing of this book was funded by Kickstarter and through looking there and the author's website I found that in fact several publishers were interested but weren't sure where it would \"fit\" to sell or wanted her to change the ending, etc. Well I'm glad she didn't change the ending to please publishers or get it to sell better because I think it ended pretty perfectly as it is. I received this book for free through the Goodreads FirstReads program."}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "I won this book on Goodreads. I understand from reading other reviews and the author's blog that it was self published. It's a beautifully written book and a well crafted story. I especially liked the depiction of the two main character's inner musings and their attempt to make sense of what they were faced with -- Tara trying to understand her grandfather, and Thomas as a German coming of age in Nazi Germany. The story itself wasn't unusual, but it was all very well told. I wish the author good luck in finding a readership as It is certainly well worth the read."}, {"userName": "Karyne Corum", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16860945-karyne-corum", "userReview": "The first time I ever heard of Shadows and Wings, it was on the author\u2019s Kickstarter video. Nikki Tulk\u2019s pitch was so powerful and passionate, I knew then and there that I had to read her book. In order to understand the remarkable richness and complexity of this book, first you must know the passion of its author, Nikki Tulk, for her creation. So strongly did she believe in the ending as she had written it, that she would not compromise when it came time for publication. This became the sticking point for several publishing houses, and she finally took to Kickstarter to get the financing so her book could become a reality. What part of someone do we love the best, the person we know or the person they really are? This is the powerful and compelling heart of this story. Shadows and Wings is something extraordinary to read. It is set in dual time frames, slipping from past to present easily which is never an easy feat for any writer and here it flow beautifully. The music of this story is as lively and evocative as a Bach sonata; the notes of the protagonist\u2019s search for the truth behind the man who was her grandfather play out like a haunting refrain that lingers long after the ending. The intricate and beautiful imagery draws you into a world that is as multi-layered as it is enthralling. The characters are authentic and compassionate and you are swiftly drawn into caring for each one and they burden of truth they are seeking. Each of them carries the false belief that each turn or path might lead them to a safe harbor. But there are no safe harbors, not anymore, if there ever really were, except perhaps in the love of those we allow into our lives. Some of the metaphors are so clever and so creative that I had to re-read them several times to really savor the beauty of them. Ms. Tulk is a master at moving the plot along without sacrificing the scenery and as you are swept along in the tide of telling, you can visualize times past and the places inhabited by distant memories.This is not a story with easy answers or contrived solutions to guilt or redemption. It is a book that speaks powerfully to what price an individual pays when a nation along with all of humanity, when war is perceived as an agent of resolution.I loved this book and each tear I shed reading it. I highly recommend it for your reading list."}, {"userName": "Cindy Blair", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20697549-cindy-blair", "userReview": "Shadows and Wings [A Fugue]I will not tell you the story of Niki Tulk\u2019s novel Shadow & Wings. I will not tell you because I cannot. The novel transcends a summary of plot, character, setting, and literary convention. Tulk\u2019s novel is a Baroque composition, a fugue of differential tempos: allemande, courante, gavotte, sarabande, meneut, and gigue. You must read the book; dance with your feet; listen with your ears. The book is for you: the travelers, the immigrants, and the exiles. It is for all of us.This novel is fugue is language is music is dance is art is memory. Sometimes memories lurk in shadows. And other times, memories take wing like a flock of unlikely birds: albatross, finch, gull, eagle, and wren. Together with a reader they fly above and beyond the printed text in cinematic experience of emotion, senses, and untimely memories. \u201cHow strange time is. One moment expands to fill a room, while others gather in absurdly tiny particles like dust, brushed into corners and never seen. Through it all, like a river, runs the feeling that had I done this or seen that, then perhaps the decision I made that day would have been different.\u201d A reader steps into this river that connects many people, many pasts, and many places that are always changing yet always singular and spatial. I began the book and could not rest until the end. Read this book to forget time and to remember the beauty of a good book."}, {"userName": "Eugenia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14805466-eugenia", "userReview": "This beautiful book lyrically portrays the shadow of World War II across three generations and leaves deliberately unanswered the question of why even good people can still allow themselves to un-see or ignore lies, injustice, and even cruelty. It tells the story of Lara, who grows up in Australia with her German Opa, or Grandfather, Tomas, and Tomas's secret past (a secret to no reader -- I think that that's a deliberate irony on the part of the novelist, that Lara is wilfully blind to her grandfather's past just as the young, idealistic Tomas was wilfully blind to the consequences of his actions).The book is consciously episodic, impressionistic, and high-minded -- even including footnotes and an extensive bibliography; casual or \"light\" readers should not be put off by the footnotes and the poetic opening sections, however, since the middle sections (where many first novels \"lag\") read easily and compellingly, and the story unfolds in an accessible manner (you can also skip the lyric fragments and move to the story proper fairly quickly, as I did on my first skim through).Full disclosure: Niki is a friend of mine and I supported her Kickstarter campaign to publish this book. I also postponed reading the novel for many months because I did not know what I'd say to her if I didn't like it, and she had been urging me to post a review. I am delighted to post this one now -- it was worth the wait to read this book slowly and to enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Deborah Brasket", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9951935-deborah-brasket", "userReview": "A beautifully written, poignant book, spanning two generations, a young Australian woman and her German grandfather. The book is written in the form of a fugue, with interweaving voices--Lara, who goes to Germany to find out about her dark grandfather's past in World War II; and the story of her grandfather growing up under Hitler's rule, while trying to pursue a career in music.The story explores the weight of love, of whether we can ever really know another human being, guilt and betrayal, and coming to terms with the past.The characters are richly drawn, the language lyrical, and the themes deep and profound. I highly recommend this novel.Full disclosure: The author gifted the book to me with no strings attached nearly a year ago as an e-book.

The author provides truly unnecessary definitions (for an adult) throughout the book as footnotes that were distracting. The very short chapters that jumped around through time were very abrupt and made the novel feel like more of a draft of a memoir with the pages all mixed up. It was difficult to follow.
