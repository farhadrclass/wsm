I have raised my children with the sole dogma that \"I read, therefore I am\". Being a family, we can't keep from judging each other according to our own specific reading preferences, and we usually believe that \"we are what we read\". At the moment, my son is reading Buddenbrooks while I am working my way through Brothers Karamazov, and we like to compare notes, especially as both novels are focusing on complicated family patterns - with which we are quite familiar.My son, frustrated with the character of Gr\u00fcnlich, a true sleazeball and hypocrite, complained that there seems to be a Uriah Heep in each family, thus reigniting a debate on David Copperfield that we had last year. Going on to reflect on the struggles of the different generations of Buddenbrooks to find a balance between individual and collective identity within a patriarchal family structure, he murmured:\"Some things are very much like our family!\"Strong personalities, big dreams, different ideas and clashing worldviews - we came to the conclusion that most families go through the general changes that the Buddenbrooks experienced during the 19th century. We could detect the same power struggles in Dostoevsky and Dickens. So it is not so much that \"we are what we read\", but rather that \"we read what we are\". And that is what makes those old-fashioned, long, over-detailed classics shockingly contemporary and relevant to us. Put a random set of characters into a house, make sure to create a balance of interdependence and delicate power distribution, and you will see them act out dysfunctional family life without needing a script to stick to. Brother One takes a role, which requires Brother Two to act out the antagonist's drama, while Sister One looks for a way out of the dilemma of being raised to obey her family and simultaneously to be proud of herself and her independence. Sister Two will oscillate between different positions to fill the gaps left by the rest of the family. And that is just the horizontal line. Add the vertical lines in the family tree and you are lucky if you manage to tell the story in as many words as Dickens, Dostoevsky or Mann.Sounds like a dull formula, but it isn't. After all, that is what we call life, and it's not dull at all. We can all spend a whole day fretting over the fact that a sibling, parent, spouse or child used a certain kind of voice level when saying goodbye, and we can read a whole generation's worth of implications into the wave of a hand. Thomas Mann put down on paper what he had experienced first hand himself, and the very fact that the family is far from unique (on the contrary, quite common) is what makes it appealing to readers of all ages.Family life turned world literature. World literature turned family competition. Who will finish first? My son with Buddenbrooks, or me with Karamazovs? If you say it doesn't matter, you know nothing of families at all."}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af \u0395\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2   Vernus Portitor

"MEAN REVERSION IS A BITCH...!!!\nThere is a concept in statistics, Regression or Reversion to the Mean, which is widely used in a variety of fields of knowledge. It was first realized by Sir Francis Galton, cousin of Charles Darwin, when he worked on the correlation of heights between adult children and parents.The concept refers to the tendency for any variable which exhibits an extreme value at any point of measurement to move towards the average next time it is measured.This mathematical tool is used regularly both in Genetics and in Finance Theory. Consequently, it is an apt model for dealing with the Buddenbrooks and their three Fs: Family, Firm and Fortune, and particularly so because the anchor of the family is precisely that: Trading. Their pride was founded upon the buying and selling of grains, and to do so in the appropriate manner with suitable methods, engaging in the right discipline, performing the relevant calculations, exerting their commercial savvy, and adhering to their code of ethics -- all of these constituted their pride and nature.The novel begins with the second generation of a family and spans five generations. Their business had, however, one generation less. The book tracks the progression of the Buddenbrooks as a function of their prosperity. The characters and their circumstances are factors that exert a force in the success trend of the family.In the Buddenbrooks the finances and identity of the firm and family are inseparably intertwined. The family\u2019s expenses are expenses for the firm. And profits from the firm accumulated as capital provide the income and living style of the family. The new Buddenbrooks house, the family symbol with which the novel begins, is a monument to itself. Family and firm reside there.In addition to the launch of the triumphal house the novel regularly pegs the level at which the Buddenbrooks capital stands. They start off with a mark of 900k Marks and the subsequent levels, which can be plotted, guide us as we follow their successes or hardships. Johann Buddenbrook the Younger begins the apprenticeship of his son Thomas by giving a quick review of the big blocks composing their capital. He understands them well. Later on Tom gives the latest balance to his sister Tony, and although the figure sounds reassuringly high to her, he however adds with concern: \u201cwe should be at one million\u201d The Buddenbrook capital has stayed sort of flat, which in any progression of prosperity means trouble. As we approach the end of the novel the family is valued at 650k, amount that will however decrease further as the assets are liquidated inadequately.So, how does this function of prosperity work? The phenomenon of moving back to the Mean irremediably starts and both Genetics and Trading are players in the game.Depending on their gender and their primogeniture the various members of family will have to perform a different role. The patriarchs, role reserved for the eldest son, are to be the main motor. When this works, it works, but the problem is that its dependency is concentrated on one individual becoming therefore too risky. We see that even the luck of begetting a male son does not guarantee the survival of the genes of mercantile prosperity. Christian turns out to be a good-for-nothing and therefore neither a support nor a back-up to the elder brother in any of the Buddenbrook responsibilities and activities. He becomes a deviation from the trend and a very strong pull away from excellence. Nor is Hanno a healthy alternative to the mercantile model. The boy inherits the artistic inclinations from his mother, but also the lack of discipline that we saw in his uncle. His musical abilities turn out to be good only for toying around with music, not really for playing or composing. He is not, as Tony hoped, a new Mozart. Surprisingly, Thomas Mann does not present the Arts and Music as Saviours for the Buddenbrooks. No redeeming transformation is generated.The women and daughters occupy a very particular position. The daughters are detractors of a significant amount of the capital, since significant dowries have to be carved out of the sustaining trunk. These side investments are expected to bring back both prestige and an extended business clout with an overall benefit for the Buddenbrooks. In this family the dowries granted out were almost all utter failures. We know that money seduces swindlers like honey attracts flies. And the Buddenbrooks, both the women and the men, suffer as the victims of the Gr\u00fcndlich hoax and of devout greed. The family\u2019s mercantile acumen was not able to detect the money-hunters. In spite of these failures, however, dowries did net in around 89k Marks thanks to the 300k that Gerda brought along when she married Tom. But it is the concentration on the different roles that the various family members have to play, according to their gender, which increases the probability of failure. Tony is a convinced Buddenbrooks even if she suffered when she sacrificed her Morten. Could she have offered the business support to her elder brother once it was clear that Christian was not capable? Or could she, or her daughter and grand-daughter, have continued the family firm similarly to the way Donatella Versace has? This is hard to say, since after all it was she who persuaded her brother of the suitability of the P\u00f6ppenrader deal. Failure or hailstorm, had she been able to participate or take over the business, the probability of survival would have increased. With this possibility barred, the P\u00f6ppenrader misfortune takes place precisely and symbolically when Tom\u2019s grandiose house and the Centennial of the firm are celebrated. It marks the resistance point and the decline clearly begins.But not all the triggers for the Verfall can be found in the family members. The novel gives loose indications of the historical and economic conditions in which we see this family\u2019s progression. We learn that although Johann the Elder expressed antipathy towards the rising Prussia, he had made a great deal of his profits by selling his grains to the emerging Teutonic Kingdom. And several times the Customs Union is mentioned, although we cannot know in what specific aspects they were detrimental for their business. Revolution comes, entertains, and goes. And the new war between Prussia and Austria remains hazily further south. When Thomas refers to the slow pace at which their benefits are made, signalling a business of narrowing margins, we wonder whether there were other factors that were transforming the business profoundly and which he was not detecting. Although the context is included in the novel, we are left with only a very general idea that the rules of the game must have changed and that these have debunked the Buddenbrooks-way. But the book does not offer further detail.So, what brought the downfall of the Buddenbrooks? It was a joint result of bad luck, some failed judgment, changing political and economic circumstances, and the determinism of social conventions. But when a reversion to the mean process begins, the causes are not important. What is important is that it happens and that it can hurt.As the Turkish proverb, that Tom quotes, says: Wenn das Haus fertig ist, kommt der Tod, and so the graphs and statistical laws show."}, {"userName": "Lu\u00eds C.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34132356-lu-s-c", "userReview": "True to his elegant style, detailed and generous in the petty small details, Thomas Mann returned with this voluminous novel in which narrates the decline and anguish of a German family of the late nineteenth century.All the complexes that can live (and suffer) people of the upper class, when they see themselves in distressing needs, are described here, with a halo of nostalgia that surrounds the conversations, which, more than conversations, are reminiscent of a glorious and buoyant past that will not come back.Tony, daughter of Herr Buddenbrook says bitterly to his father: \"Oh dad, we should never get away from these places, there are a lot of us here, in other places they would not understand us and we would suffer because of their gestures, mockery and dishonesty.\"Tying to the earth (L\u00fcbeck), to what it was and isn't anymore, as unconsciously trying to make everything as it was yesterday, that moderates the daily experiences of this family.Like all the works of Thomas Mann, the Buddenbrooks are a picture that mixes the sociological with the psychic, the old with the current, the beautiful of the past with the harsh reality of the present.A relaxing book, to read in one afternoon of copious rain (which was not exactly the case), without great surprises and deep moments of meditation."}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "Reviewed in September 2013Buddenbrooks sat on a high shelf in the back-room of my mind for many years, and though it remained unread it was nevertheless honoured with a prime position; I hoped to read it one day but doubted my own ability to comprehend what I thought must surely be a very difficult text.I first came across Buddenbrooks among my older sister\u2019s university text books. Her German edition impressed me not only for the mysterious title composed of familiar syllables which the stringing together all in one word rendered solidly impenetrable, but also because of its bulkiness, each page dense, the capitalisedmultisyllabledcompound words tightly packed like a battalion of heavilyarmouredforeignsoldiers. Even in an English translation, I feared I would not be able to separate those syllables and enter the text: Buddenbrooks was a country I would never be able to visit.Many years pass. My reading life becomes a little more adventurous and one Thursday in May, or is it October (time moves fast in Buddenbrooksland), I find myself seated in the landscape-room of a large house in L\u00fcbeck, in the company of little Tony Buddenbrook, her brothers Tom and Christian, her parents, her grandparents, her cousin Clothilde and family friend Sesemi Weichbrodt.What a surprisingly pleasant visit this has turned out to be, I think, as I settle myself comfortably into the yellow cushions of the sofa, feeling welcome from the very beginning in that bright and elegant house in Meng Street. I am charmed by everyone and everything I meet both within the house and outside; the people, the food, the wine, the furnishings, the entire Buddenbrooks world like a giant bottle of delicious pink champagne all wrapped up in golden tinsel. But as soon as I've settled myself comfortably into the narrative, I find that ten years have flown swiftly by, their events recounted in little more than summary form. Okay, I think, now that all the back story has been provided, the narrative will get underway properly; Tony is at an interesting age, perhaps she will become the definite focus of this book? Christian too seems to have potential, maybe he will be the vehicle for Mann to develop his themes. Or will it be Tom who becomes the focus, although Tom seems a bit plodding and dull. Or perhaps it will be their little sister, born in a gap between summaries. But no, I think it is going to be Tony after all because we\u2019re skipping forward in time again and Tony is now a young lady and she is travelling to the seaside at Travem\u00fcnde. This change of location comes just in time for me, as like her, I was beginning to find life in Meng Street a little claustrophobic. I\u2019m loving the descriptions in this section, the sea, the rocks, the states of mind. There are some fascinating new characters and Tony is growing quite interesting herself. I want her to grow up, to no longer be the schoolgirl who says: \u201cI shall marry a business man. He must have a lot of money, so I can furnish elegantly.\" Perhaps her life can take a new turn here, away from L\u00fcbeck, away from commerce, away from the family. I am excited for her. I see freedom on the horizon, new ideas, new prospects.Ah hah - I\u2019ve just noticed the subtitle, relegated to the back cover of my edition:  The Decline of a Family.I know now that the story can\u2019t focus exclusively on Tony. In spite of her charming upper lip and her interesting throaty voice, the story has to be about the family, the entire Buddenbrook clan and their common destiny, and the narrative must stay firmly rooted in L\u00fcbeck. That means more skipping through time; any periods which the main characters spend away from their home town are reduced to a summary. And what a surprise, the plodding and prudent Tom emerges as a principal character in so far as there can ever be a principal character in this family saga. He has become interesting too in his own way; I suspect depths which his role in the family don\u2019t allow to be revealed but which nevertheless attract my attention from time to time like a stray piece of tinsel in the bottom of a drawer. It\u2019s as if a little bit of his brother Christian\u2019s effervescence lies hidden behind Tom\u2019s carefully monitored exterior. Christian\u2019s own effervescence is sadly short lived, and his life has been reduced to little more than a broken champagne glass lying in a dusty corner. Tony, in the meantime, has been shattered too but she glues herself back each time because, unlike Christian, she is driven by her astounding reverence for the idea of family, and her particular type of effervescence, less ebullient perhaps than Christian\u2019s, nevertheless lasts longer; her comments, at times courageous, at others, hysterical, punctuate the narrative like the popping of a champagne cork.Two thirds of the way through the novel, there is a shift in the narrative as well as the location. The glory days in Meng street are over and a new and fascinating character, at least for me, is introduced. Commercial concerns fade into the background and music begins to take a leading role in the story; the reader is treated to a beautiful and elegant coda for this Buddenbrook symphony. I had begun to really enjoy this section but all too soon, the symphony ended almost on the same note as it had begun: with the fluty tones of the 'little prophetess' and altogether noble character, Sesemi Weichbrodt.What place will Buddenbrooks occupy in the back-room of my mind now that I\u2019ve read it? A prime position on that high shelf of books I hope to reread? Perhaps not. I think I will lay it down in the cellar among those dusty, overblown wine bottles which will never be uncorked but which I keep for nostalgic reasons; I won\u2019t be opening Buddenbrooks again."}, {"userName": "Councillor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-councillor", "userReview": "\"The sad thing is that one lives but once\u2014one can't begin life over again. And one would know so much better the second time!\"\n\nThe family saga of the Buddenbrooks is considered a classic of German literature, a book many people have already heard about, yet never read for a very simple reason... it's loooong. And if you appreciate your books with action and thrilling stuff, then Thomas Mann's novel is not exactly the book you should turn to because it would only disappoint you.It took me almost three months to fight my way through the novel. I read the original German version, and as a native German speaker, let me tell you something: reading classics in German is much more difficult than reading classics in English. And Thomas Mann certainly knows how to keep his sentences long-winded, letting them run on and on over the course of half a page before finally ending the sentence (if you're lucky). Back in school, my German teacher would have had a mental breakdown if I'd made him read sentences like this in my exams.Basically, the story of the Buddenbrooks consists of a plot outlined in an exceedingly detailed way, narrated through a lot of different days set in the family members' everyday life, which includes a lot of time jumps. Dealing with their struggles and important events like births, deaths, marriages, divorces and financial businesses, the characters are elaborately established, especially siblings Tony and Thomas, who soon solidify their roles as main protagonists. Both are flawed human beings, are responsible for a lot of mistakes, and have to deal with the deeds they have committed in the past. The story revolves around the development of the main characters, as Thomas Mann allowed readers to follow Tony, Thomas, Christian and other characters from their childhoods to their deaths. Mann did not even attempt to make his characters appear perfect, he attempted - and succeeded - to make them appear realistic. Certain supporting characters lack some attention by the author, but in my opinion, Mann managed to unite plot and character development nearly perfectly.\n\n\u201cOften, the outward and visible material signs and symbols of happiness and success only show themselves when the process of decline has already set in. The outer manifestations take time - like the light of that star up there, which may in reality be already quenched, when it looks to us to be shining its brightest.\u201d \n\nThe sentences are laboriously convoluted, sometimes leaving me without any kind of overview on how this sentence may be structured. The writing style is not difficult to read and understand, though - Mann is able to write engaging chapters, using exactly the right lengths and engaging his readers by creating an interesting atmosphere and allowing you to easily imagine the setting in front of your imaginary eye. And there is a certain subtlety about his humor, which I was personally able to enjoy a lot.If you don't know much about this time period, then Thomas Mann's epic novel about this huge family living and working in L\u00fcbeck (a city at the Baltic Sea in Northern Germany, set in a region which I can only recommend visiting) might be quite an interesting reading experience. It's a tedious book, but ultimately, it was absolutely worth the time I spent reading it.[Review completely rewritten 14 April 2017]"}, {"userName": "Jan-Maat", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat", "userReview": "How could Katia Pringsheim have gone on to marry Thomas Mann if she had ever read his first novel, Buddenbrooks beforehand? The long story of a families multifaceted decline across four generations features mental anguish, bankruptcy, insanity and no happy marriages.Thomas Mann's first novel is set among the L\u00fcbeck Patrician class of leading merchants who dominated the small city-state. Mann drew heavily upon the family background that he left behind, along with the world of business, to make himself into a writer in Munich instead. There is no such escape for his fictionalised family in Buddenbrooks. For them the pride in their heritage becomes an obligation. A yardstick that serves only to measure the extent of their shortcomings, however Mann's analysis of the families decline is not so straightforward. Contingency is a major factor. They lose out from unexpected bankruptcies, they miss out on opportunities, the currents of the economy change and shift about them, they don't adapt and are slowly left behind \u201csitting on the rocks\u201d as others, including would be suitor the medical student Morten, steam ahead . For Thomas Mann as an author the deconstruction of his heritage is a creative act that allows him to reconstruct himself into a novelist. Before Buddenbrooks Thomas had only published short stories and the narrative he produced here is not continuous. Reading it is like admiring a series of Hogarth prints like The Rake's Progress or Marriage a la Mode. Some chapters could be split off and read as a story on their own. There are years between some chapters. The point of view character changes. At one point a chapter consists only of a letter sent from one family member to another. Mann created the novel as a federation of short stories, bound together by common characters, setting, images and the notion of inescapable decline. The decline of the Buddenbrooks is complex. For one the family fails to nourish. Like poor Klothilde they eat and eat but don't grow sleek. Christian is prematurely aged. Tom worn out. Tony educated to be helpless, she clings to the intellectual highpoint of her life \u2013 the conversations she had with the student Morten at the age of sixteen \u2013 decades later recommending to her brother to read newspapers that had long ago ceased to be printed. The whole of Fontane's Effi Briest is given over to the story of a woman educated to be a child and married to be a dependant, but Tony's story of a woman searching for a role is an alternative take with an ironic twist is itself just one strand of Buddenbrooks. I prefer the Fontane, but I have to give credit to the scope of Mann's ambition. Their world is changing around them, they fail to flow with the Zeitgeist. The big politics of 1848 and the wars of unification are in the background. Their world is a shrinking pond. When they venture outside they are at the mercy of bigger fish. Each character in successive generations succeeds in both being a type and true to their time while also being an individual.This is the book that gave rise to the idea of a 'Buddenbrook syndrome' used to describe the practise of commercial families to withdraw in the second and third generations from business and to put their time and money into leisure activities as well as anticipating (maybe even inspiring) Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism in its treatment of the part played by religion in the inner lives of the Buddenbrooks. The neverending oppressive school day that robs little Hanno of vitality would feature again in his brother Heinrich Mann's novels The Blue Angel and Man of Straw.The concerns with philosophy and music that Mann developed further in The Magic Mountain and Doctor Faustus here suggest that the decline in the world is balanced by an inner refinement. That the increasing interior richness of their lives renders them unable to compete with their local rivals, the grossly corporeal Hagenstrom family. For all their status inside the city the new Germany is dominated by the old landed aristocracy - something that will be expressed with more brutality and bitterness in Man of Straw by Tom's brother Henrich Mann.The gloomy, pessimistic story is told with irony, which can keep the characters at arm's length, but then since they tended to fail to achieve connections with spouses and other contemporaries was perhaps just what the author intended. He escaped and transcended his heritage \u2013 his characters couldn't."}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "[The book ends on a tragic note with the surviving women dealing with the aftermath of Hanno's death from typhoid fever.

my first Goodreads reading group experience and I have to thank both Kalliope and Kris for having pointed this work out to me and for having allowed me to participate. I also want to give thanks to all the reading partners who keep posting invaluable comments which have helped me to better grasp the nature of this novel. \n\"Life was harsh: and business, with its ruthless unsentimentality, was an epitome of life.\"\n(Buddenbrooks, p.363)Had I been told that an objective, even detached depiction of the downfall of a merchant family in a North-German town in the nineteenth century would shake me they way Buddenbrooks has shaken me, I wouldn't have believed it possible. But what I find most impacting is that even though I was prepared to witness the much forewarned decline of this family I was swept away completely all the same by the pragmatic but intense tone of the narrative which stirred unintended, troubled feelings in me.Told in an omniscient, impartial voice and taking for background the first symptoms of major social and economic changes in Germany on its way into 20th Century modernity and uncertainty, Mann opens the narration with an opulent banquet in 1835 where the three generation of Buddendbrooks are celebrating their social and economic prominence and future prospects. Mann describes their world in detail and masterly pictures the characters with all their hopes, fears and ambitions, all this in a brilliantly flowing language.The story mainly follows two of the children: Thomas, the crown prince who has been prepared to take over the firm and to become the future ruling man in the family, and his beautiful sister Antoine, a spoiled, naive creature with bourgeois airs but good-natured heart who will see her life expectations vanish and her dreams disappear as years go by.While Thomas embodies the vitality, strength and vigor of a prosperous, responsible merchant of the time, his hypochondriac, indolent brother Christian and eventually Thomas\u2019 introverted and frail son, Hanno, fail their merchant inheritance in allowing their artistic vocation to prevail over their duty to the firm, condemning the Buddenbrook name into oblivion.In this sense, Mann sets the tone for some themes in his forthcoming works, one of them being the refined and sophisticated artistic attitude opposed to the simple, healthy and pragmatic life of a merchant family, a poignant subject in this novel and one which could also have reminiscences of his own personal experience.Although Mann treats his characters lovingly he always keeps in an ironic distance which reminds the reader that the fate of the Buddenbrooks is a sealed one and that, like in life, eventual decay and ultimate death can\u2019t be prevented. And this  natural cycle of ups and downs  both of the firm and the family, for they are bound together, is precisely what makes possible that a naturalistic story such as this one could reach one\u2019s soul and fill it with wonder with its delicate and effortless language.In the end, nothing is left, no grand house, no flourishing firm, no prominent family. The Buddenbrooks sink back into meaninglessness. Only an old volume with the genealogy of the whole family remains, echo of a long gone world and the only proof of what once was and never will be again. But with the end comes freedom.\n\"Was not every human being a mistake and a blunder? Was he not in painful arrest from the hour of his birth? Prison, prison, bonds and limitations everywhere! The human being stares hopelessly through the barred window of his personality at the high walls of outward circumstances, till Death and calls him home to freedom!\"\n (p.506)"}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Absolutely excellent, descriptive writing. Writing that pulls the reader in. Characters that are fully developed and totally real. A book with humor. A book with serious topics to consider. A book about life\u2019s ups and downs. Every time the theme changed I was astonished to once again see how this topic and that topic and every topic touched upon had something to say to me. A long book that does not drag. I loved reading a book set in Germany before either of the world wars! The Revolution of 1948 and the war against Denmark are briefly featured. I enjoyed observing, with humor, cultural differences within the country, how the Prussians view the Bavarians and the Bavarians the Prussians. The setting is primarily L\u00fcbeck in the 1800s. Clothing, foods, furniture, beliefs and traditions of the era and place are all picturesquely depicted. Here is a multi-generational novel where a large number of characters are introduced early in the story and stay around long enough so that the reader comes to know each one intimately. The characters mature yet each remains true to their distinctive personality. There are characters with widely differing traits, but usually there were both good and bad qualities in each individual, and this made each feel real. Themes? There are so many. Loyalty to one\u2019s family. Sibling relationships \u2013 jealousies, competitiveness and innate differences. Family enterprises. Moral standards. The importance of art and music. All of which can be weighed one against the other. Choices must be made. This is a new audiobook; it came out in October 2016. The narration by David Rintoul is stupendous. When an audiobook is this well read it is impossible not to recommend listening to it rather than reading it. Fantastic intonations for the respective characters. Perfect speed. Perfect pronunciation of French and German dialects. A simply wonderful narration. This is a classic to be read or preferably listened to. ************************After a bit more than 1/3:I am liking this a lot! Wonderful writing. Very descriptive, but in a good way. You see everything right before your eyes. There is humor. The events pull you in. When terrible things happen, even to people you dislike, you care, you need to know how the problem will be resolved.It has been ages since I have read such a great multi-generational saga!

It's 1848, and the revolutionary tide running through Europe has finally reached L\u00fcbeck. Will the old merchant families hold on to power? Of the Buddenbrook children, only Tom remains to learn the business. Toni is in Hamburg married to Herr Grunlich, and Christian has gone to England but would rather be in Valparaiso. J Thomas and Gerda's son Hanno shows no aptitude for business, but may make a great musician.Lovely to revisit this having just visited the beautiful hanseatic league town of L\u00fcbeck.\n\"An enormous brick-red, boiled ham appeared, strewn with crumbs and served with a sour brown onion sauce, and so many vegetables that the company could have satisfied their appetites from that one dish.

Published in 1899 when dude was like 25 years old. Must've taken a couple years to write. Can't imagine a current undergrad publishing something like this in a few years. But I didn't actually read Mann's text -- Mann comes to me filtered through John E. Woods's sensibility and super-steady, elastic, attentive prose style. The duo is as good as it gets. Of the four \"major\" Mann novels (plus the famous novella about the chicken hawk who dyes his hair, which I read 10 years ago translated by someone other than Woods or Michael Henry Heim -- we should really all write to Woods and ask him to translate the \"stories of three decades\"), I'd rank this ahead of neck-and-neck third and fourth place finishers Doctor Faustus and The Magic Mountain, but behind the monumental achievement of Joseph and His Brothers, the importance/impact of which deepens in my mind now that a year or so has passed since I read it. I love the thematic overlap among these novels. In \"Buddenbrooks,\" there's the sort of transgenerational family saga he returns to thirty years later in \"Joseph and His Bros,\" specializing in sibling conflict; Hanno and his mah's musical obsession echoes \"Doctor Faustus\" in advance -- the super-descriptive pages toward the very end relaying young Johann's improvisation on piano pulled out the prose stops, suggesting the confounded turbulence of youth, including in Hanno's case the suggestion of a desire to get with his cool friend Kai (I'm sure Mann's novels have launched hundreds of dissertations exploring his portraits of restrained sexuality); there's illness as in \"The Magic Mountain,\" particularly Christian's case. But generally I was surprised how immersive this was, how quickly I entered the world of the story and lived with this middle-late 1880s generation. I expected something far more stodgy and comparatively amateur (like proto-Mann), I think, and so was pleased to move through this and find him writing at the highest level from the get-go -- it's not a \"soap opera\" as some on here have said, but Tony's kiss with the aspiring young doctor at the beach as a teen and the subsequent betrothal to the ridiculous obsequious Bendix Grunlich with sideburns dusted in the same gold powder they use on almonds around Xmas really got me into it -- the conflict between love and familial duty, the sort of restrictions that in the West have gone extinct for the good of society but the detriment of our literature. Loved the repeated image of the waves \"raucously\" crashing on the shore, their \"ineluctable\" succession suggestive of the passage of time, generations that emerge from the previous and give way to the next -- loved Thomas's evening of mystical insight after reading some philosophy (its Eastern overtones reminded me of Schopenhauer) and his totally realistic determination to change his life and then after a few days return to his entirely societally constrained ways. Loved the conflict between Thomas the rational conservative duty-bound for the family's sake to stand firmly in the past and Christian the globe-trotting liberated gadabout who tells a good story and cares not about convention with both feet planted in the future. Loved the conflict between the old ways and the emerging new (exemplified by the organ teacher's initial exasperated disdain for Wagner, followed by his understanding and appreciation). In the same ballpark but not quite playing the same socio-historical game as Joseph Roth's The Radetzky March -- unlike other Mann novels that have an eye out (often maybe semi-excessively explicitly in Magic Mt. and Dr F.) for the political situations of their time, this one seems more completely focused on its characters and their world. Loved how Mann handled Tony's every utterance with characteristic affectionate \"gentle irony\" -- loved how Mann never condescends to characters he knows are questionable, how he stands back and presents it with at most a suggestion of judgment. Loved the patient, thorough, consistently reinforced characterizations (Christian's roving eyes and trouble swallowing and story about Johnny Thunderstorm; Thomas's mustaches waxed and curled to extend beyond his either cheek). Loved the minor characters, particularly the early iteration of Gosch, whose first name I won't dare try to spell, awed by Gerda's beauty, with his hair combed forward over his brow. Loved how Gerda is like one of those mysterious statuesque women who glide from the shadows of ruined Gothic novel estates. Only Clara seemed undercharacterized and only once or twice did I feel a little confused about a plot point. There's so much life in here, all of it lived and \"real\" without a trace of post-modern or post-realist \"reality hunger\" techniques -- it's about as straight-up conventional pre-Joyce steady third-person narration as could be, a proper novel uber alles, the shoulders-of-giants Faulkner will stand upon when he conceives of the Compson family fallen on hard times (thanks to a review on here that mentions this parallel). Makes me want to read more 19th century lit like Dickens, Austen, Eliot. Anyway, a great novel, totally ambitious, controlled, and affective in its portrayal of a family's decline thanks mostly to the natural progression of innate individual sensibilities making their way through life -- ends on a really pessimistic note, something along the lines of \"life will crush us all\" -- but overall its presentation of life's deep dark richness and warmth is somehow optimistic, or at least suggests that our brief experience of however many days we're allotted is absolutely worth it."}, {"userName": "Nood-Lesse", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10729786-nood-lesse", "userReview": "Un uomo non educato dal dolore riman sempre bambino I personaggi abbondano ma sono presentati in modo spartano, delineati con i tratti necessari. Non c'\u00e8 quell'esasperazione tipicamente e insopportabilmente russa, infarcita di politica, patronimici e dovozione alla Grande Madre. Non ci sono quei capitoli infiniti, satolli di tirate filosofiche. I capitoli dei Bundenbrook sono brevi, per essi riesumo un paragone che si presta bene data l'ambientazione tedesca: un litro di birra si beve pi\u00f9 velocemente in cinque bicchieri da 0,2 che in un boccalone da Oktoberfest (Per gustarlo al meglio consiglio due pinte da 0,5).Mann racconta della famiglia Buddenbrook partendo dal 1835 e lo fa per istantanee. In esse il particolare di una giornata a scuola ha la stessa rilevanza della morte di uno dei membri della famiglia. La sua \u00e8 solo apparentemente una democrazia narrativa, i dettagli sparsi e mischiati sono l\u00ec perch\u00e8 ci\u00f2 che sta raccontando assomiglia molto a qualcosa di reale, perch\u00e8 di una vita non rimangono che dei dettagli a volte inutili, a volte cos\u00ec sconvolgenti che solo riducendoli allo stato d'inutilit\u00e0 si pu\u00f2 continuare a sopravvivere.Il mio entusiasmo nel primo quarto di lettura era assoluto. Dal secondo quarto in avanti per\u00f2, da Sparta ci si trasferisce ad Atene e le descrizioni si fanno pi\u00f9 particolareggiate. Il fulcro della narrazione \u00e8 sorretto da due fratelli (Thomas e Christian) e dalla sorella (Antonie). La decadenza inizia quando il padre (Johann) muore ed essi ereditano la ditta di famiglia. Due sono i dati che mi hanno colpito: il primo \u00e8 che il romanzo sia autobiografico al punto che Mann, proprio come i suoi personaggi, apparteneva ad una famiglia di commercianti di Lubecca, il secondo che lo pubblic\u00f2 a soli venticinque anni. C'\u00e8 una consapevolezza in queste pagine che non ti aspetteresti da un giovane, che credevi possibile solo in et\u00e0 adulta. Che cosa \u00e8 una vita in fondo, riducendola all'osso? Nascita, matrimonio, figli, nipoti, morte. Quando Mann arriva alla voce morte, quando consegna il testimone familiare al personaggio successivo dell'albero genealogico, \u00e8 da non credere la sicurezza con cui lo fa. I personaggi di Mann muoiono come se fossero veri, come se l'autore avesse assistito alla loro dipartita e un giorno avesse deciso di scriverne. Insieme ai personaggi ottocenteschi periscono le loro idee, la loro solidit\u00e0, il mondo come Mann doveva averlo conosciuto da piccolo.Suggestioni\"Un brav'uomo, una volta, mi ha detto che la vita vola via pi\u00f9 in fretta di una vacanza estiva, aveva ragione.

Quattro settimane, un periodo che all\u2019inizio non si poteva concepire n\u00e9 misurare, che era impossibile credere che finisse e della cui fine era comunque infame crudelt\u00e0 parlare.Il piccolo Johann non cap\u00ec mai, come questo o quell\u2019insegnante potesse avere il coraggio di pronunciare, alla chiusura delle lezioni, frasi come: \u00abDa qui proseguiremo dopo le vacanze, per passare a questo e quest\u2019altro...\u00bbPoi incominciava la giornata, la prima di quei miseri ventotto giorni, che da principio sembravano una felicit\u00e0 eterna e che, appena trascorsi i primi, svanivano con disperata velocit\u00e0...Ed erano trascorsi quattordici giorni, e Hanno diceva a se stesso e assicurava chiunque volesse ascoltarlo, che c\u2019era ancora un periodo di tempo lungo come le vacanze di San Michele. Ma questa era una consolazione illusoria, perch\u00e9 giunti al culmine delle vacanze, ora si scendeva verso la fine, velocemente, cos\u00ec velocemente che egli avrebbe voluto aggrapparsi ad ogni ora perch\u00e9 non passasse via, e rallentare ogni suo respiro di aria di mare, per non sprecare con incuranza quella felicit\u00e0. Ma il tempo trascorreva inarrestabile nell\u2019alternanza di pioggia e di sole, di brezza di mare e di terra, di caldo immobile e soffocante e di fragorosi temporali, che non riuscivano a oltrepassare il mare: e sembrava non volessero pi\u00f9 finire..E quando rimanevano ancora tre giorni, allora Hanno diceva a se stesso e spiegava agli altri, che c\u2019era ancora un periodo lungo come le vacanze di Pentecoste. Ma, per quanto questo calcolo fosse incontestabile, non ci credeva nemmeno lui, e da lungo tempo si era impadronita del suo cuore la sensazione che l\u2019uomo dalla giacca lustra di lana pettinata avesse proprio ragione, che le quattro settimane avevano pur una fine e che ora si doveva pur proseguire, dal punto al quale ci si era fermati, per passare a questo e a quest\u2019altro..."}, {"userName": "Ilenia Zodiaco", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18922532-ilenia-zodiaco", "userReview": "Il mio stato d'animo a lettura ultimata:Seconda fase:Terza fase (rivolgendo il mio pensiero a Thomas Buddenbrook, in particolare):"}, {"userName": "Mala", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5960716-mala", "userReview": "[ Thomas Buddenbrook, in a supreme act of understanding & sacrifice, relieves his son of the burden of carrying the family business forward.

periodo d\u2019oro ove, per sfuggire a una preoccupante timidezza, faceva incetta di letture classiche. Poi, non avendo nessuno con cui confrontare le sue giovanili impressioni, si dimenticava il tutto nel giro di un annetto. La prima pagina reca la scritta, in bella grafia tonda tondissima, da liceale per niente sui generis \u201cRoma, \u201895\u201d. Il che vuol dire che lo comprai alla Stazione Termini, mentre con la mia classe si aspettava di salire sul treno per Vienna, per una promettente e cazzeggionissima gita scolastica di fine liceo. Di sicuro, lessi il libro al rientro, ch\u00e9 allora non ero mica conciata come adesso, dove il mio ritmo di lettura \u00e8 imbarazzantemente indietro rispetto all\u2019acquisto compulsivo di materiale cartaceo. Quindi, facendo due calcoli, letto nel \u201995, al rientro da una gita di cui non ricordo quasi nulla se non le palle di Mozart e una polverosa ed elegante atmosfera, condensata in architetture secolari di cui non ho saputo godere a pieno, per osmosi non mi dev\u2019essere stato difficile entrare in sintonia con la famiglia Buddenbrook. Sono certa, sempre basandomi su dati storiografici, che avr\u00f2 anche edith-whartoneggiato un po\u2019, considerando che L\u2019et\u00e0 dell\u2019innocenza di Scorsese era uscito appena un paio d\u2019anni prima, e la festa d\u2019apertura con l\u2019ardita e suggestiva teoria di salotti di casa Beaufort, ricorda molto il fragilissimo equilibrio borghese del sontuoso banchetto inaugurale con cui apre la scena Mann. L\u2019egoteque giovanile, mi deve quindi aver distratto da un particolare che adesso non posso ignorare e che fa dell\u2019autore tedesco, oggetto eterno della mia ammirazione. Cio\u00e8 che questa fu la sua prima opera. E non parlo di una di quelle opere meditatissime, che gli autori conservano nel cassetto della scrivania in mezzo a pacchetti di sigarette, pistole ad eventuale usum suicidium, e testamenti poco compiacenti. Opere che dopo lustri di ritocchi e rimaneggiamenti vengono finalmente alla luce, grazie a un editore pi\u00f9 sveglio degli altri, e capace di riconoscere il genio latente. No no. Non \u00e8 il caso del giovane virgulto Mann. Alla stessa et\u00e0 in cui io prendevo il treno per Vienna, e l\u2019unico mal sottile che mi consumava era quello di avere una cuccetta con la mia amichetta del cuore, lui era gi\u00e0 redattore di un foglio satirico e gi\u00e0 si avviava verso una consapevolezza di s\u00e9 che io non ho manco ora. All\u2019et\u00e0 di ventidue anni, un\u2019editore importante lo sollecita a scrivere qualcosa di pi\u00f9 corposo di qualche raccontino. E Mann cosa fa? Leggero come solo un genio pu\u00f2 essere, prima chiede al fratello se vuol fare una cosa a quattro mani, stile Goncourt, poi siccome non se ne fa nulla, si stringe nelle spalle e dice \u201cvabb\u00e8, faccio da solo\u201d. Una cosa tipo che io dico a mio padre, ci vieni a far la spesa con me? Non vuoi accompagnarmi? Vabb\u00e8 dai, vado da sola. E quindi Thomas si mette a scrivere. All\u2019inizio pensa, ma s\u00ec, faccio una cosina corta, la storia di una famiglia che decade nell\u2019arco di quattro generazioni, poi si accorge che \u00e8 un tantino pi\u00f9 lunga di quello che aveva previsto. L\u2019editore gli dice, bello di zio, il lettore ti manda a quel paese se si deve cimentare in cose lunghe quanto un rotolone Regina, taglia un po\u2019, da retta a me,ma Thomasino bello punta i piedi, o cos\u00ec o pom\u00ec. L\u2019opera viene quindi pubblicata integrale, e dopo un primo tiepido approccio da parte del pubblico lettore, pi\u00f9 per una questione di prezzo che di gradimento, fa il botto in edizione economica. Un clamoroso successo. A distanza di quasi un secolo, aggiungerei meritatissimo. C\u2019\u00e8 un verso molto famoso di una canzone di Mercede Sosa, che dice \u201ccambia el m\u00e0s fino brillante, di mano in mano su brillo*\u201d. Mann, di quel verso, si pu\u00f2 dire ne abbia fatto una parafrasi, raccontando il processo di opacizzazione di una famiglia, preziosa e fine come un brillante, incastonata tra personaggi diversi ma luminosi come zaffiri, tra una Toni che ricorda i vezzi infantili di una Rossella O\u2019Hara senza la sua saggezza finale, un Christian ipocondriaco e tutto teso in una concentrazione interiore, un Hanno sensibile e quasi catartico, e un Thomas giudizioso e severo, che scopre il segreto dell\u2019esistenza troppo tardi, e come Martin Eden, nel momento in cui seppe, cess\u00f2 di sapere. Una saga monumentale che a me servirebbero quattro generazioni solo per pensarla, figuriamoci per scriverla. Invece Thomas, fresco fresco, la scrive a ventidue anni, tra Roma, Palestrina e Monaco. Come dire, la giovent\u00f9 bruciata come fenomeno sociale, ha ancora da venire. Se volete sapere quanto sia salutare e necessario leggere un classico come questo, per stile, per realismo e per caratterizzazione psicologica, leggete altre recensioni. Io vi dico solo che leggere \u00e8 un po\u2019 come partire per altri lidi, ma partire \u00e8 anche un po\u2019 morire. Ecco, se volete morire invidiosi ma soddisfatti, questo \u00e8 il libro giusto. *Cambia il brillante pi\u00f9 prezioso, di mano in mano il suo splendore."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "I am especially grateful for Kris Rabberman's invitation to join this group read. My experience with Thomas Mann had been limited to the short novella Death in Venice. This group has broadened my reading horizons. Without the enthusiasm of the moderators and group members, it is highly unlikely I would have turned toward Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family.My review will be forthcoming, with the added proviso that I am woefully behind on my reviewing. However, in short, Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family is the story of generations of the Buddenbrook family. They are merchants in the grain industry. Mann covers the generations from the time of family members who lived through the Napoleonic Wars through the end of a dynasty. It is that \"decline\" of a family that provided this reader with constant fascination.The history of a disunited Germany floats through the history of the Buddenbrooks, always in the shadows. Events have little apparent effect on the family. I strongly recommend doing a bit of supplementary reading regarding the Revolution of 1848-1849, The German- Austrian War, The Franco-Prussian War, and Otto von Bismark. Mann's references to these events are quite subtle, which serves as a background to which the Buddenbrooks seem to turn a blind eye.Turning once again to the dynamics of this group read, the Moderators, Kris and Kalliope have done a masterful job. Discussion among those reading the novel has been lively and thoughtful. If you're looking for a way to wrap your mind around a book which has given you pause in the past, I can assure you there's a group of \"Kindred Spirits\" out there, each with their particular strengths involving cultural and historical influences. Highly recommended band of readers."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "\"That all those charms have pass'd away, I might have watch'd through long decay....\"\n\"And Thou art Dead, as Young and Fair,\" Lord ByronThomas Mann's moving 1901 saga of the Buddenbrooks, a respected, wealthy family of grain merchants, begins in 1835 at the death of the patriarch. The three successive generations suffer a decline in their finances and family ideals as values change and old hierarchies are upset by Germany's rapid industrialization. Two of the siblings, Thomas and Antonie, subordinate their personal happiness to the welfare of the family business. Antonie in particular gives up happiness twice for appearance's sake, each time being ravaged by reverses.While Mann wrote this novel largely in an objective manner, the story represents a condemnation of the decadence of a materialistic society, as shown through this family. While the Buddenbrooks were naturally honest and good, imbued with love of family, they were also afflicted by a blind loyalty to their own class. They viewed each significant event in their lives, such as births, deaths, marriages, and social decisions, in relation to its effects on the family business. Their refusal to adapt to changing conditions, to act from their moral convictions rather than treating their business as a religion, and to accept those not of their class led to their destruction. Mann showed an incredible attention to the descriptive details of the period as well as his affinity for leitmotifs such as those derived from his love of the operas of Richard Wagner. For example, blue skin and yellow teeth to represent decay and decadence in the family members."}, {"userName": "FeReSHte", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL":

\u2014 a par com Proust, Pessoa e Nabokov \u2014 capaz de comunicar o que tem para dizer de forma n\u00e3o apenas imensamente acess\u00edvel, mas ao mesmo tempo envolvente e sedutora. A eleva\u00e7\u00e3o do seu registo, apesar de complexo nunca se enreda em palavreado desnecess\u00e1rio ou meramente exibicionista. A constru\u00e7\u00e3o do texto, por mais trabalhada que surja, parece nunca dizer de mais, nem de menos, como se tocasse sempre o acorde harmonicamente correto, permitindo-nos seguir o desenrolar da narrativa sem notar qualquer disson\u00e2ncia entre forma e conte\u00fado.\u201cOs Buddenbrook\u201d \u00e9, antes de mais, a primeira obra de Mann, publicada com apenas 25 anos, mas iniciada com 22 anos, o que s\u00f3 por si \u00e9 verdadeiramente impressionante. Custa a perceber como \u00e9 que algu\u00e9m, t\u00e3o novo, consegue o registo de eleva\u00e7\u00e3o acima identificado, mas tamb\u00e9m como \u00e9 que consegue o grau de amadurecimento para chegar \u00e0s an\u00e1lises sociais e psicol\u00f3gicas apresentadas. Lobo Antunes estava claramente errado, quando criticou o pr\u00e9mio Leya 2014 dado a \"O Meu Irm\u00e3o\" de Afonso Reis Cabral, com apenas 24 anos. S\u00e3o idades tenras para se criar com f\u00f4lego, mais ainda em literatura, mas as excep\u00e7\u00f5es existem, e Mann foi \u00fanico. N\u00e3o \u00e9 por acaso que, e apesar do Nobel (1929) lhe ter sido atribu\u00eddo j\u00e1 depois de publicado \u201cA Montanha M\u00e1gica\u201d (1924), o texto da Academia Sueca fa\u00e7a men\u00e7\u00e3o expl\u00edcita ao seu primeiro livro, dizendo que o pr\u00e9mio lhe era atribu\u00eddo, \u201cprincipalmente pelo seu grande romance \u201cOs Buddenbrook\u201d, que conquistou crescente reconhecimento como uma das obras cl\u00e1ssicas da literatura contempor\u00e2nea\u201d.Excerto: \"E o resto do dia obedecia a um ritmo livre e despreocupado, seguindo o rumo de uma vida maravilhosa dedicada ao \u00f3cio e ao bem-estar, sem sobressaltos nem preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es: de manh\u00e3, enquanto l\u00e1 em cima a banda executava o seu programa matinal, Hanno permanecia \u00e0 beira-mar, deitado ou sentado aos p\u00e9s da cadeira de praia, entretido, no seu jeito sonhador e distra\u00eddo, com a areia fina e pura, os olhos, sem esfor\u00e7o ou dificuldade, vagueando e perdendo-se na imensid\u00e3o verde e azul, os ouvidos envoltos num doce rumor que se desprendia, com liberdade e desembara\u00e7o, das ondas infinitas, uma brisa poderosa, fresca, selvagem, portadora de um perfume divino, apta a aturdir, a inebriar suave e subtilmente os sentidos, produzindo um mudo e apraz\u00edvel esbatimento da no\u00e7\u00e3o do tempo, do espa\u00e7o e de todas as fronteiras\u2026\" (p.528)\u201cOs Buddenbrook\u201d \u00e9, como poder\u00e3o saber das sinopses, um \u00e9pico familiar, seguindo uma influ\u00eancia de final do s\u00e9culo XIX, \u00e0 semelhan\u00e7a do nosso \u201cOs Maias\u201d (1888). Mann por sua vez, mais do que concentrar-se sobre as rela\u00e7\u00f5es de amor, concentra-se especificamente sobre as rela\u00e7\u00f5es que unem a fam\u00edlia \u2014 av\u00f4, pai, irm\u00e3os, e la\u00e7os de casamento \u2014 analisando a sucess\u00e3o geracional, come\u00e7ando pelo auge do bem estar e terminando na perda de tudo. A obra \u00e9 muitas vezes definida simplesmente pela hist\u00f3ria de decad\u00eancia da fam\u00edlia Buddenbrook, uma decad\u00eancia que ultrapassou as fronteiras da literatura, e serve hoje \u00e1reas como a hist\u00f3ria e a economia, para identificar o que ficou conhecido por \u201cefeito Buddenbrook\u201d, ou seja, o facto de que a riqueza acumulada atrav\u00e9s dos neg\u00f3cios tende a declinar ao longo de um per\u00edodo de tr\u00eas gera\u00e7\u00f5es.Mann procura alguma neutralidade no modo como apresenta a fam\u00edlia e sociedade que a envolve, n\u00e3o tomando partido pela religi\u00e3o ou pol\u00edtica, deixando no entanto emergir aquilo que em sua opini\u00e3o marca as nossas vidas, opondo o materialismo ao espiritualismo, nomeadamente a oposi\u00e7\u00e3o entre a vida burguesa (Thomas, pai e av\u00f4) e a vida de artista (o irm\u00e3o Christian, e o filho Hanno). A primeira com as suas regras e rituais que obrigam a casamentos combinados em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do bem de toda a fam\u00edlia, ao respeito das normas e complac\u00eancia com o funcionar da sociedade. A segunda que a nada obedece, a ningu\u00e9m segue, e tudo recha\u00e7a, baseada na frugalidade material, buscando apenas a imaterialidade das ideias. O momento que marca esta clivagem acontece quando Hanno toma contato com o di\u00e1rio da fam\u00edlia, uma esp\u00e9cie de jornal-di\u00e1rio das v\u00e1rias gera\u00e7\u00f5es de Buddenbrook, e resolve deixar ali o seu testemunho, \u00e9 algo t\u00e3o simples mas t\u00e3o poderosamente significante que nos arrepia e obriga \u00e0 reflex\u00e3o e aprofundamento do choque entre estas duas vis\u00f5es do mundo.Ali\u00e1s, n\u00e3o fica claro at\u00e9 que ponto Mann n\u00e3o tende para a culpabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dessa componente art\u00edstica pelo fim da fam\u00edlia. Digo que n\u00e3o fica claro, porque existem outras vari\u00e1veis em campo, nomeadamente o ponto em que o senador Thomas Buddenbrook se deixa levar pela leitura de \u201cO Mundo como Vontade e Representa\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d (1819) de Schopenhauer. Mas essencialmente, e como acaba discutindo recentemente Riemen em \"Nobreza de Esp\u00edrito\" (2008), baseado em Mann, existe algo que n\u00e3o \u00e9 propriamente de neutralidade, mas antes de busca de uma certa integralidade humana, de ess\u00eancia humanista, que apoquenta Mann e que o conduz \u00e0 aceita\u00e7\u00e3o da diverg\u00eancia da norma, da subvers\u00e3o art\u00edstica, reconhecendo-a como pr\u00f3pria do humano, mas que apesar disso deve ocorrer por meio de um paradigma de eleva\u00e7\u00e3o, de respeito pelos demais, acima tudo de di\u00e1logo construtivo.Dito tudo isto, pergunto, como se pergunta a respons\u00e1vel pela bel\u00edssima tradu\u00e7\u00e3o no posf\u00e1cio, Gilda Lopes Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o, porqu\u00ea ler \u201cOs Buddenbrook\u201d mais de 100 anos depois? A realidade retratada \u00e9-nos distante, em nacionalidade e mesmo mecanismos sociais ou negociais. Julgo que a resposta est\u00e1 exatamente na forma, na beleza da obra, no brilhantismo do seu criador, na recompensa pela boa progress\u00e3o da narrativa, e que n\u00e3o poucas vezes nos surpreende, mesmo sendo t\u00e3o regrada. Mas essencialmente porque ler duas p\u00e1ginas de Mann, mesmo que pouco avance na hist\u00f3ria, \u00e9 como insuflar ar em estado puro, faz-nos sentir vivos, ajuda-nos a compreender a for\u00e7a e relev\u00e2ncia da arte liter\u00e1ria, verdadeiramente estruturante para o modo como pensamos e nos edificamos enquanto seres conscientes.Ler com links em Virtual Illusion (http://virtual-illusion.blogspot.pt/2...)."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Peto", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4107370-jonathan-peto", "userReview": "I read a review recently of a historical novel. The reviewer believed that most historical novels fail, because they depict characters with a modern consciousness. These characters often defy the thinking of their times and act in ways that we can approve of. This novel is not historical fiction, but the fact that it was written over a hundred years ago and is full of completely recognisable, very vivid, and obviously historically accurate characters is just one of the things that wowed me about this book, Thomas Mann's first. Sure, the characters do not hold all our values, but they are so like us, in good ways and bad ways, that it reminded me that our lives, in a sense, have been lived before.And that is humbling. But the book is so well-written, filled with so many beautiful passages, so many extremely clear depictions of important aspects of life. The realisation that all these emotions and situations have occurred before, millions of times, in millions of places, usually without an amazing novelist as witness, isn't even scary (most of the time) because I was just so impressed with Mann's ability to touch on so much. He writes about a specific family during a specific time period but makes it breath-takingly universal. Some characters appear throughout, but there are many viewpoints. Curiously, the novel, though clearly \"literary\", may even be an early example of a sub genre, the business novel, though I really have no idea how far back that sub genre goes. The Buddenbrooks are merchants, and the business environment, livelihoods, is a lively and interesting element of the novel's setting. The Buddenbrooks' decline and their business savvy is linked. We hear so much about today's changing economy; we ponder the unknowns and calculate, but that too, it is apparent from this novel, is not unique, even though differences between today and yesteryear obviously abound, humans have looked over similar precipices before... It's an old novel, but I found it very readable and modern. Most chapters are short. A lot of exposition and description are not incorporated within \"action\", as may be more the norm today, but it was not monotonous or boring. If you want to see examples of lively exposition and lively \"telling, not showing\" that sparkles, read Buddenbrooks. Mann moved between exposition and scenes without apparent effort, and the scenes are exquisite. I'll try to recall some of them without giving too much away while hinting at their scope: banquets full of innumerable characters, siblings in their twenties playing it cool, young adults at the beach with their whole lives ahead of them, school days, class distinctions at play between various characters in various situations, characters with broken dreams rationalising, broken men at the beach relaxing, going to the dentist, playing music, getting sucked into a philosophy book for the day, shirking responsibilities, facing death, and much, much more."}, {"userName": "Three", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5052227-three", "userReview": "\u00e8 troppo grande, non ho paroleEDITEppure, arrivata alla terza lettura di questo libro straordinario, qualche parola vorrei provare a scriverla. In fondo, questo \u00e8 l\u2019unico classico (fra i non molti che ho letto, lo ammetto) che parli alla mia sensibilit\u00e0, grazie ad una modernit\u00e0 che non \u00e8 scalfita minimamente dal fatto che i personaggi accendano lampade a gas e non luci a led, e si scrivano lunghe lettere e non messaggi whatsapp. Solo che non \u00e8 possibile estrarre da questa opera totale uno, due, tre episodi di cui scrivere: \u00e8 pi\u00f9 straordinaria la pagina in cui il console Johann si rende conto di essere caduto in inganno sulle capacit\u00e0 economiche del genero, e di avere di conseguenza indotto la figlia a sacrificarsi in un matrimonio che, oltre a non essere d\u2019amore, non \u00e8 neanche d\u2019interesse; o quella in cui i medici, richiesti di alleviare le sofferenze della anziana morente, rifiutano di farlo, dicendo che loro non devono procurare la morte ma conservare il pi\u00f9 a lungo possibile la vita? E\u2019 pi\u00f9 bella la descrizione delle gite al mare, quelle di Antonia ragazza che incontra il suo primo amore e quelle di suo nipote Hanno molti anni dopo; o quella della festa di Natale nella casa dei genitori, con i rituali familiari, gli eccessi alimentari, le riflessioni malinconiche che tutti, almeno qualche volta nella vita, abbiamo sperimentato il giorno di Natale? E\u2019 pi\u00f9 bello il personaggio di Thomas, che fin dall\u2019adolescenza d\u00e0 tutto se stesso al lavoro e al dovere che sente di avere verso il nome della sua famiglia, e si occupa senza risparmio dell\u2019impresa famigliare, delle istituzioni cittadine, delle malefatte del fratello degenere, dei matrimoni falliti in serie dalla sorella e della figlia di questa, ma fallisce - come moltissimi uomini di successo e di potere - nel rapporto con il figlio pur amatissimo, fino ad arrivare, ancora abbastanza giovane, ad essere sfinito, travolto dalla nevrosi e dalla consapevolezza di avere vissuto secondo l\u2019idea di come doveva vivere e non secondo le proprie inclinazioni? O il personaggio di Antonia, che passa attraverso una serie di disgrazie personali e familiari, ogni volta piangendo tutte le proprie lacrime ed ogni volta riprendendosi grazie a fiocchi di velluto e tappezzerie di seta, forse stupida o forse - come si dice adesso - resiliente? Splendido, comunque, \u00e8 il rapporto fra questi due fratelli che per tutta la vita hanno totale confidenza reciproca, suggellato nel libro dal brindisi silenzioso che fanno, loro due soli, ritagliandosi un momento nel cuore della festa di Natale, ai due ex mariti di Antonia, rappacificandosi con il loro ricordo e considerando che in qualche modo anche loro fanno parte della famiglia.Mi inchino al venticinquenne Thomas Mann, che circa centovent\u2019anni fa ha scritto tutto questo e molto di pi\u00f9. Certo, pu\u00f2 essergli stato di aiuto il fatto di provenire da una famiglia che gli dava materiale per la scrittura di un simile libro, ma non potr\u00f2 mai capire come abbia fatto, a quell\u2019et\u00e0, ad avere tanta sensibilit\u00e0 per il modo di pensare degli anziani, per l\u2019atteggiamento loro (ma anche dei pi\u00f9 giovani) verso la malattia e la morte, per la crisi esistenziale di un ultraquarantenne, per le difficolt\u00e0 di un padre (quale lui non era ancora) nel rapportarsi con un figlio, per le fragilit\u00e0 e per le astuzie di una donna. Forse, per riuscirci bastava essere un genio."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "Mann's first novel and quite a saga it is; a family history stretching through the latter half of the nineteenth century and over three/four generations. It is more accessible than some of Mann's later works as here all the big topics that Mann raises are couched in routine and the daily rhythm of life. In his first novel Mann is writing about what he knows; these are the people and details of his childhood and upbringing, clearly set in his hometown of Lubeck.I was a little reminded of the Palliser novels, but though there are similarities, Trollope was more of a plain storyteller. There is always much more going on with Mann. I can imagine scholars of literature writing articles like \"Dentistry and Death in Buddenbrroks\". Decay and decadence are important themes. The tensions that the desire for an artistic life creates in a conventional bourgeois household. Yet there is an element of soap opera too; Thomas Buddenbrook upstairs reading Schopenauer whilst his wife is downstairs having a musical dalliance with a lieutenant. The typhoid motif appears for the first, but not the last time; rearing its head again in \"Death in Venice\".Of all the characters; for me the most significant is Antonie (Tony), who is in the book from beginning to end. Tony is the custodian, resilient; surviving life's setbacks. Her life is unfulfilled and she never forgets her youthful attempt at rebellion; this is clear at the end of the book. She also attempts to keep the peace between her two brothers.It is an impressive novel which straddles two centuries in its creation. Anthony Heilbut argues that Mann here creates a transition from Wagner and Nietzsche to Freud and Schonberg. There is always a sense of the fragility of life; death is always close and often the end is sudden. The book also ends quite suddenly. There remains an interesting undercurrent; Hanno is quite a novel character. He is uniterested in games, a target for bullies, an aesthete. Kai and Hanno provide a homoerotic undercurrent as Mann explores what is to be a recurrent theme in his novels. An interesting precursor to those later novels."}, {"userName": "Rod", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3973093-rod", "userReview": "In the introduction there is an anecdote about a female friend of Mann's who read Buddenbrooks and liked it very much, saying she was never bored by it, but she was unable to explain why. Word.I've never liked books like this; you know, multi-generational family sagas, sort of soap opera-ish. Perhaps it's because I was bored to tears as a kid by TV miniseries like East of Eden and Rich Man, Poor Man. After reading Buddenbrooks, though, I realize that maybe I just thought I've never liked books like this, when actually I really dig them. In any case, I really dug this one. I could just be attracted to Mann's wondrous prose; his children called him \"Die Zauberer\" for a reason, I imagine. Regardless, I was drawn to the Buddenbrooks in Buddenbrooks. They're real. I know these people. Even though I've never been and probably never will be part of the aristocracy, I nevertheless found a lot to identify with in these characters. I didn't completely identify with Thomas or Christian, but I did see aspects of myself in both. The same goes for little Hanno, probably more so than I would care to admit. And Tony. Tony, Tony, Tony. Without naming names (I do have family members on Goodreads), do I ever know Tony. I'm sure I'm not alone; undoubtedly anyone with family is going to feel a certain sting of recognition at some point during the reading of Buddenbrooks. This just tells me that Mann is writing something that is real and applicable to life. This is the second time I've been under The Magician's spell, the first being during my reading of The Magic Mountain, and I'm sure it won't be the last, as I have some more Mann lined up to read. And perhaps there should be some more multi-generational family sagas in my future. What's that?

While I'm an enthusiatic reader of 19th century English and (to a lesser extent) French literature, my exposure to German literature of this period has been sadly lacking. So I'm glad to have had the opportunity to read this novel along with other neophytes and with experts in German literature. While I mostly lurked on its fringes, the group discussion has been informative and stimulating.To a large extent, the plot of this novel is disclosed in the title and all the rest is detail. It concerns a prosperous and well-respected family from the mercantile middle class of northern Germany, whose wealth and social status are dissipated with each passing generation until the family effectively disappears altogether. Mann concentrates on two characters in particular, Thomas Buddenbrook and his sister Antonie. Both identify strongly with their family and make decisions based on what they believe is owed to its history, its reputation and its continued prosperity. Neither is destined for happiness. Mann's prose and descriptive ability are superb. Or at least I assume they are, because they've been rendered beautifully in the translation by John E Woods. The story is told through an omnipresent, omniscient, rather detached and ironic narrator. This is both a strength and weakness of the work. While the narrator is able to explore the perspective and motivation of the various characters, the detachment and irony of the narrator's voice may be the reason I didn't feel fully engaged with the characters. I would have liked to have been more moved by the characters than I was. For me, the fate of the Buddenbrook family was of more intellectual than emotional interest. Oscar Wilde famously defined a cynic as someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. The Buddenbrooks certainly knew the price of everything. I don't know that they were necessarily cynical, but most members of the family had a warped idea of the value of their family, seeing it only in terms of what it owned and what it could buy. Mann's account of the family's downfall is a salutary lesson of the dangers of being the kind of person described by Oscar Wilde. I've now moved on to another 19th century middle class family saga, The Man of Property, the first novel in John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga. It will be interesting to see Galsworthy's take on middle class sensibilities in a changing world."}, {"userName": "Jonfaith", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "userReview": "Apparently this was Faulkner's favorite novel from Mann. Aspects of it likely permeated his epic of the Compson family. Coincidentally I read this one while my wife's sister was staying with us over the holidays. The Sound and The Fury was read in 2004 when we visted her in London.I thought of this novel yesterday while reading Nancy Mitford's Pursuit of Love. One almost needs to polish silver when pondering these works."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "After thinking about this book for a bit I've decided it's now or never for this review. I've also decided to increase my rating to 5 after contemplating my primary reason for marking it a 4...the tedious description of Hanno Buddenbrook's day at school. Discussion with others has caused me to look at this somewhat differently, as a portrayal of an unbearable situation during what was proving to be a quite unhappy life. All of this fits with Mann's subtitle \"The Decline of a Family\".The novel presents the history of the Buddenbrook family over several generations in their home city of L\u00fabeck. They have lived as grain merchants, certain of their own place in society and the world (and the next world too). All members are raised to live for the family's betterment. But there are cracks even in the earliest generation we meet, where the patriarch cannot love the firstborn son whose existence meant the death of his first wife. As his second son was to say: \"A family has to be united, to hold together, Father; otherwise evil will come knocking at the door.\"This need for unity might come back to haunt Johann and the family. Johann's generation maintains the illusion of success through carefully arranged marriages and alliances, remaining in L\u00fabeck while much is changing in other parts of Germany and the world. Success is often on paper, while happiness is not considered a necessary ingredient of life. And then the next generation, the generation of Johann's children, Tom, Christian and daughter Tony. Each has his own burden to carry for the sake of the family firm. Tony is chattel of a sort to bring income. Tom is to carry on the name. Christian...well he does not fit any role as things devolve.Tom is the identity of the family in L\u00fcbeck. He is Buddenbrooks. But who is he. \"No doubt about it---Thomas Buddenbrook's existence was no different from that of an actor, but one whose whole life has become a single production, down to the smallest, most workaday detail---a production that, apart from a few brief hours each day, constantly engaged and devoured all his energies. He completely lacked any ardent interest that might have occupied his mind. His interior life was impoverished, had undergone a deterioration so severe that it was like the almost constant burden of some vague grief. And bound up with it all was an implacable sense of personal duty and the grim determination to present himself at his best, to conceal his frailties by any means possible,  and to keep up appearances.\"Neither work, nor marriage, nor parenthood provided any ease for Tom. Ah the Buddenbrook legacy, like one of those creatures of the wild, devouring its young.I do recommend this book heartily. Though it is lengthy, Mann provides many shifts in time, setting and characters as the reader moves though the generations. There are comic moments to counter the sadness and irony scattered throughout.Thanks to all the members of the Buddenbrooks Group for opening up so many levels of this book to me (most of which are not revealed in this review!)."}], "description": "Verfall einer FamilieIn der Fassung der Gro\u00dfen kommentierten Frankfurter Ausgabe\u203aBuddenbrooks\u2039 erschien 1901 und war Thomas Manns erster Roman.
