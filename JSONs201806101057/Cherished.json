Being human we have all had failures in our lives, many of them moral failures and we allow those failures to make us unworthy of God's love and forgiveness. Kim confronts this head on and leads us on a journey to that acceptance of God's forgiveness and self-forgiveness. This is a moving book that had me in tears a few times. Kelli and Heather have different pasts that have brought them to different places but with the same outcome - they are both overcome with shame. God brings them to a place of grace and I loved the vessel that God used as a mentor in their lives. It helped me realize that God will use even the most unlikely people to be His vessels of ministry to others. In this case an older woman steps in to be Heather's mentor and ends up mentoring both of them but she is the most unlikely person to mentor Heather (the best friend of the wife of the married man that Heather had an affair with...). It turns out to be the most amazing spiritual support system and just what they all needed. Seeing how God made something beautiful out of the situation was a excellent example of God's grace. I love how reading books by Kim Cash Tate is like having a Bible study while you are enjoying a story - she weaves spiritual truths into everything in a beautiful way!"}, {"userName": "Tiffani Friedmeyer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23365501-tiffani-friedmeyer", "userReview": "Such an amazing book!!!!!!

Cherished is an easy read and what I liked most about the story line is that despite being a romance book with a Christian theme, the characters are all fully human and flawed, and have had to go through tough situations that they got themselves into because of poor choices that they've made, because of a deliberate decision to sin. The story also showcases some people we all know are lurking in the church and in most christian communities, those that show a facade of holiness, actively participating in different ministries and yet has not been truly converted and continues to make the habit of sinning. And there are those, who were beyond grateful towards the shedding of Jesus's blood for our sins remission, that despite their shady past, they decided that the only way to live now as people freed from the bondage of sin, is to become slaves of Jesus Christ. Going over what I wrote just now, I actually realized that this is a book that's central theme is God's will for our lives and that even if we make bad choices or have detours along the way, He is still able to complete His plans for us (Romans 8:28), only of course, if we are willing to follow Him, but mostly to let go of our favorite sins. Cherished is a book about God's redemption, mercy and grace, peppered with romance - the godly way.Kim Cash Tate is no doubt a gifted writer and I pray that continues to write books for God's glory. When God blesses me with a daughter, I'll mark her books as the ones that my girl will be reading when she's in her teenage years."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754448-brenda", "userReview": "I have read many good things about Kim Cash Tate and her first book \"Faithful\" so I was anxious to sample her writing for myself and all I can say is I was blown away with her ability to make me feel the emotions that the characters feel, with a plot that is very easy to relate to. I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster ride, feeling the ups and downs of the characters.I laughed and cried, but also found the positive christian message woven in to be perfect for the struggles we face today. The choices each character makes takes them away from God, and they must learn to not only find forgiveness for others but to also forgive themselves and realize that God \"Cherishes\" each and every on of us.Once I started reading this story I realized it was actually a continuation of \"Faithful\" but I hadn't read the first book and had no problems getting right into the story. If your looking for a story, that will remind you that God still loves you even when you mess up, filled with down to earth characters that are so very easy to relate to then you really should give this book a try."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5372197-megan", "userReview": "After I started reading 'Cherished', I realized that there was another book, 'Faithful', that the author had written before this one that had many of the same characters in it. So now if I were to read that book, I will know what happens - ugh! However, 'Cherished' is a novel that can be read on it's own.Kelli and Heather both have their share of guilt, shame, and regrets for choices that they made. For Kelli it's the choice she made when she was a teenager. For Heather the decision she made to have an affair with a married man. Both are learning that they need to lean on the Lord and trust in Him to heal their wounds.'Cherished' was so much better than I expected it to be. I completely enjoyed reading it and even though I know what the outcome of 'Faithful' will be, I still want to read it.

The writing was very smooth, the characters were well-developed, and the storyline was believable. I love that I learn lessons while the characters minister to each other. Cherished deals with a couple of heavy topics- abortion, forgiveness of self and forgiveness of others. Kelli and Brian (AKA Alien) have some unresolved issues that come to light in a series of coincidental (or divine) events. Kellie learns quickly that bottling up and building walls do not equal forgiveness. She has a long road, as does Brian, but thankfully their prayerful family and friends are there to support.We also get to see Heather start on her own path of redemption and forgiveness. I can't say any more without giving something away :).Cherished is a great read.

Mostly good. First of all, it made me cry a few times. Yeah, like the tears rolling down your cheeks kind. I get a bit misty eyed sometimes when I read, but not usually real tears. I have never suffered like Kelli had, but there was just something about her grief and healing that was very inspirational. I loved how the characters all focused so much on prayer and seeking God's will for their lives... even for the seemingly minor stuff. We should all be like that. Sadly, we aren't. It made me think of \"The Cosby Show\" from the 80s and how it was criticized by some as being unrealistic. The way I saw the show was the it introduced to viewers how families could communicate and act. Not that families did that, but it was an inspirational example to me when I was a teen. But life tends to be more like the \"Roseanne\" show from the 80s. Kids are snarky and disobedient and the communication is anything but positive. I couldn't stand to watch that show when I was a teen because everyone was so disrespectful. So the author did a Cosby spin on what could have played out like a Roseanne show. People could have been more hateful, rude and ugly. They could have wanted to make the other person suffer to the extreme. But how do you show healing that way? So technically some things wrapped up in a fairly tidy fashion...probably tidier than they would in real life. But that doesn't mean it couldn't be inspirational in that it shows how people can support each other, pray for each other, forgive each other, etc. Yes, there were imperfect characters and realistic scenarios, but healing was the emphasis in this novel. I couldn't help admiring that.I found the romantic aspects of the novel quite good. I loved how realistic Heather's emotions were and how her transformation was truly a miracle. If Heather had been real, I'm not thinking things would have played out quite as nicely. She became kind of child-like in her innocence, but then again, she was \"born again\" and that is supposed to give us all a fresh start. In real life the baggage tends to sneak back and hang on more than it did in Heather's life, but I still admired her. I hope there is a third book starring Heather. And I adored Logan. I want to see how her life plays out in a third book. Please?The message regarding Kelli and Miles was good. Faith is important in any relationship. Do you really want to be praying for the man you love for years hoping he will go to church with you and find God? If you love Jesus, is loving Him and hoping the man you love will change when that man doesn't love Him, too? I also loved the realism with the guy Ace. There are some wolves in sheep's clothing out there (ironically I have a book with this title myself) and that was how I saw Ace, the drummer. Sadly, many women who are band chasers give them what they shouldn't, and this just perpetuates the sin. It's hard to say more without posting any spoilers. I loved the men in this book. How I wish all men were the same way. But one can dream, right? Thankfully I have a great husband myself. If nothing else it shows single Christian women what a man can be like and to aim higher than just accepted love on a surface level. Last, the coolest message in this book was the one about taking risks. If we keep our pain to ourselves, there is no healing. If we keep our healing to ourselves, then we can't help others to heal. The message is clearly that God wants us to humble ourselves so He can use us, even our mistakes and bad choices, to help others know Him more. That's my review and I'm sticking to it. All in all, a great book!"}, {"userName": "Kathleen (Kat) Smith", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328680-kathleen-kat-smith", "userReview": "Sometimes the mistakes we make in our life can act as road blocks. They can prevent us from ever seeing our true potential and pursuing the dreams we were meant to fulfill. I read the most amazing book that sets out to show you through fictional characters just how those road blocks can prevent us from finding our purpose in life and what God wants for us to become.In the book, Cherished by Kim Cash Tate, we find ourselves in the second book of the Women of Faith series. The three characters whose lives we will follow are that of Kelli London, Heather Anderson and Brian Howard.Kelli London has always dreamed of becoming a songwriter and glorifying God with her songs of praise. But after falling into sin, she walks away from her dreams. Heather Anderson's life has spun out of control - first an affair with a married man and then a one-night stand with the drummer of a popular Christian band. Broken and alone, she discovers the only one who can save her. Brian Howard grew up as a science geek. But after making the worst mistake of his life after high school, he finds forgiveness in Christ and is being led down a completely different path. Now he must choose whether to continue pursuing his PhD in biochemistry or become a full time Christian rapper.This novel shows readers that God can still use them in spite of their worst choices. He doesn't just forgive them, they are truly cherished. We can be embraced by the same great love when we learn that true forgiveness for ALL of our sins is right before us. Through these characters we see how they struggle to resolve their own personal conflicts and find a way to finally forgive themselves. I think this book is very relevant to our times because so often we feel like a choice we may have made so long ago, is the very thing we can't be forgiven for. But there is nothing, NOTHING, you can do, that God will not forgive you for if you just ask and believe that you are valuable in His eyes.When we do that, we can see what God's future is for us and how we can move forward with nothing holding us back. I received this book compliments of B & B Media Group for my honest review and think this is a MUST READ! Especially in today's world, we find our value in the wrong things, be it a job, a title, the things we own, what we do, who are friends are, and most of all what we think of ourselves if often times so wrong. Self Esteem issues for women is at an all time high, with teen suicides, bulimia, anorexia and eating disorders dictating what is acceptable for society. I would rate this book at 4.5 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Patricia Kemp Blackmon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5314062-patricia-kemp-blackmon", "userReview": "Kelli London is a broken soul. Even though she had spent much of her teen years in church it has been seven years since she has attended a service. She had also abandoned songwriting a gift God had meant for her to use.Then she moves to St. Louis after college in hopes of finding employment and to spend some time with her two brothers and their wives. Her brothers have joined an amazing ministry at Living Word Community Church and she decided to join them at church. Kelli starts opening her heart but is somewhat of a Doubting Thomas. But her sister-in-law Stephanie believes in the power of prayer and is not willing to let Kelli give up on what they have prayed for . We all need to find someone to disciple us back into the fold and encourage our new journey. Then things get even more complicated for Kelli, her high school sweetheart Brian seems to be attending the same church she is attending. Old wounds open fester. But over time and much prayer she begins to heal. In this story you will also read about Heather her story I felt was similar to that of Mary Magdelan's. Purity is encouraged and taught all through the writings in this book.Kim, the author, definitely has a winner here in this book. She brings the characters alive. So much so that I felt a part of their lives. She shows that God has a plan for everyone. It is just that you have to open your heart and follow the path he has cut for us. Prayer groups, circles or buddies is much encourage in this story. Some say prayers just aren't answered as fast as the author has portrayed. But I say they can I have experienced it in my own life. It is just that you really need to be careful how you pray because God has a great since of humor, not answering quiet how you had meant him to. But it is the path he has chosen for us and is up to us whether we choose it or not. This book really opened my eyes then my heart to be more open to God and ask him to lead me on the path set for me. An important fact in this book is being willing to forgive. Not just each other but ourselves. It is a beautiful story one I will treasure.

The women in \"Cherished\" learn that God loves them and He will forgive them if they turn to Him in repentance. This is a story about a group of friends and family members who were active in a large church in St. Louis. Kelli has recently returned home to St. Louis after living in Texas for several years. She dreamed of being a Christian singer and songwriter when she was in high school. However, she became romantically involved with her boyfriend and got pregnant. Brian, her boyfriend, refused to accept any responsibility for the situation and Kelli was left to fend for herself. She decided that having an abortion was her only option, but she kept this a secret from her family and friends. She has not seen Brian for many years and she does not think she will ever be able to forgive him.Heather's life was shattered when she had an affair with a married man and was forced to leave her beloved church. She then had a one-night stand with a singer in a popular Christian band and was devastated when she found out that he had a girlfriend and he had no desire to have a relationship with her.These women were confused, lonely and broken. Kelli and Heather became friends and learned that they had value and were worthy of love and redemption. They found that anything was possible when they put their faith in God. They received valuable mentoring and friendship from their Christian sisters at church. The women learned and accepted the fact that they were cherished as beautiful daughters of Christ. The theme of this book is forgiveness....we learn to accept God's forgiveness, to forgive others and to forgive ourselves.I do not read very much fiction, but I found this story very inspiring and comforting. I could feel real empathy for the characters in the book. I was laughing, crying, loving and hating right along with Kelli and Heather. \"Cherished\" reminds us that we can always go to Christ and receive forgiveness. We are cherished for who we are, not for what we do or don't do. We have hope for a bright future...no matter what we did in the past. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Christian fiction and is seeking a book that is uplifting and inspiring.

Will she ever accept the fact that no matter what she has done God loves her?Brian is studying towards a PhD at Washington U, and he's also a Christian Rap Artist. He's a big name in the music industry, but he's not sure if he should continue or quit so he can focus on his studies.Cherish focuses mostly on the lives of Kelli, Heather and Brian - each one made choices they regretted. They are believable characters dealing with real life issues, and I liked them. Liking Heather - I surprised myself with that one. For a while there I was as upset as Dana. I understood how she felt about Heather and why she felt Cyd had betrayed her. As Christians, we know we should forgive others as God forgives us, but that doesn't mean it's not going to be difficult sometimes. Dana's struggle was realistic and I appreciated that. I also appreciated reading a story where Christian characters weren't always strong in their faith - the doubting and having difficulty believing at times was also realistic.I like the fictional characters and places Kim Cash Tate creates. Even though these people have problems, I always get a good feeling while I'm engrossed in the pages. Tate knows how to write a Christian novel that ministers; she gave me a lot to think about as far as spiritual matters are concerned. I love that she doesn't shy away from using Scripture to back up the truths she wants to get across. Actually, this novel could teach a person how to communicate with God. I loved how the characters prayed for each other.There was just one thing I found disappointing: Phyllis Hayes didn't show up much. She was my favorite character in Faithful, and I was looking forward to finding out what was going on with her. My little disappointment aside, this was a very good read.

The dialogue felt really contrived, there were too many characters too quickly without enough character development for me to keep them straight. I love reading Christian fiction books, they are my favorite genre, but this one felt a little too 'preachy' in the beginning for me. There were many times where it just felt forced, it needed to be a little more subtle, because it distracted from the story. Then there was a major plot point which I felt was uncovered in a very unrealistic way, and had a theology attached to it that I didn't agree with.ALL of that aside though, I did find myself continuing to read the book and wanting to see how it all ended. The story was a little unreal, but the music lover in me enjoyed the main story line of the book. After I got past my initial hesitations I really enjoyed the book. It was a slow start, but a great ending. A quick read that was enjoyable. I even found myself bookmarking a few lines here and there to go back through and read again later.I would recommend this book to anyone who can't forgive themselves.

Will they allow God\u2019s mercy and grace to capture them and to guide them to the plan He has for their lives?There were several things I enjoyed in this book.*The different ethnicity of characters. Just at my church, we have white, black, and Hispanic members. It\u2019s a good mix, and I love that. The body of Christ is all races, and Christian fiction books should reflect our diversity of race but unity in the brotherhood of Christ. The author pointed out race a little too much for my liking at the beginning as she introduced characters. (One character looks at another and just wonders about his race\u2026didn\u2019t seem to fit the moment. A brief description of the character would have given the same information.) *The development of characters. I felt I knew them by the end of the book.*The theme of being cherished by God. I needed to hear that today as I read the book.*The openness of topics the church usually tries to ignore. In the Christian church world, we often try to hide sin. We don\u2019t want to think that people in the church struggle with addiction, sex outside of marriage, pornography, abortion, and the other sins Christians have deemed \u201cthe bad sins.\u201d This book shares two women\u2019s struggle with sin that others judge as far worse than their sins. It\u2019s an open look at the weight of guilt when it\u2019s carried around and the forgiveness that comes through not only accepting Jesus\u2019 forgiveness but also forgiving ourselves. It\u2019s an important story that needs to be read. I felt convicted for holding someone\u2019s sin against them, but I also felt convicted to forgive myself for sins in my past that I still beat myself up over.

I really had no idea what the story was about when I picked it, but I'm so glad I read it!The two main characters, Kelli and Heather, are both trapped by sin in their life, believing that they have messed up so bad that God won't forgive them or use them for His purposes. When Kelli moves back home to be near her family, she finds that confessing her sin is the first step to bringing healing. When Kelli's sister-in-law decides to disciple her and Heather, a new believer, the two form a fast friendship. Heather learns to see herself as God sees her, a new creation, redeemed and purchased by the blood of Jesus. Kelli finds she's not the only person broken by her past and that God still has plans to use her music to reach many more hurting people.The beginning of the book felt a little forced at first, until you get to know the characters better. I also would've liked to have seen a couple more relationships restored by the end, but the book only covers a short span of time and some things just take more time. I found that many of the thoughts and feelings that the main characters had were things I could closely identify with. I loved the clear message of God's mercy and grace in redeeming sinners. The women received a bookmark when they started their discipleship: * Done. * Gone. * Covered. * Cleansed. * Wiped. * Washed. * Renewed. * Restored. * FORGIVEN.On the back was the verse Psalm 103:12: \"As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.\" This book is all about that; how Jesus paid the price for our sins on the cross so we could be forgiven, washed, cleansed, free. That doesn't mean our lives will be easy, and other people may not be as willing to forgive us, but what matters is that we are a new creation, made perfect in God's sight.

Faced again with her once-dream of songwriting, and with the man she thought she'd spend forever with, Kelli has to let go of the past and forgive. After she returns to her faith, song lyrics start coming to her again and together she and Brian write and record his next album\u2014Love Letters\u2014the foundation of which is the love letter to their baby. Throw in bereavement, a new baby for Kelli\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, and a fellow singer with an eye for Brian, and you have a well-crafted story that leaves you wondering if Kelli will ever say yes.Heather\u2019s story runs parallel to Kelli\u2019s, but with a twist. She\u2019s the woman who slept with the husband of Kelli\u2019s sister-in-law\u2019s best friend. But her story doesn\u2019t end there. Caught up in another affair, this time with a Christian drummer, she finds herself alone and ashamed. At her lowest, she comes face to face with Logan, the worship pastor of the choir Heather sang in. The two form a friendship, and Logan does a splendid job of leading her to a deeper relationship with God and encouraging her as a brother. While the book\u2019s blurb says she \u2018has to leave behind the only life she\u2019s ever known\u2019, that\u2019s not completely accurate. Heather\u2019s life is too close to the people she\u2019s hurt and she longs to start over. Reconnecting with her half-brother, who lives 2 hrs away, she finds a position on a youth worship team and jumps at the chance to begin afresh. The trouble is, the separation only brings her closer to Logan, and I\u2019m looking forward to the continuation of their story in future books. This book is a beautiful tale of how hard it is to forgive the deepest of hurts. And yet how freeing it is when we embrace God's love for the people in our lives.For this and other reviews, check out my blog... www.nataliagortova.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732142-erin", "userReview": "The Daughters' Fellowship group is back in this sequel to \"Faithful\". Here our beloved trio of best friends returns, along with two new main characters to teach us about friendship and life and learning how to walk with God.Kelli is a young woman who dreamed of a career in Christian music... until she made a decision that she is sure God could never forgive. Now trying to find fulfilment in other areas, her life seems to be on a slow ride to nowhere. When her outspoken sister-in-law discovers some of Kelli's old songs and decides to make it her business to break Kelli into the music community, Kelli struggles with the desire to stay where it is safe and the faint hope that maybe somehow God could still use her even after all these years.Heather was the woman literally caught in adultery in \"Faithful\". She feels empty and worthless as she tries to re-establish her life... and then she meets Jesus. The old Heather is washed away and \"new Heather\" begins a quest to discover how God has redeemed her and all the plans He now has for her. It's a long road, because everyone knew who she used to be. Heather and Kelli become friends while sharing discipleship classes, and together they find strength to begin walking in newness of life.Forgiveness is a main theme in this book, either learning to forgive yourself or someone else, and to choose to look at how God sees each of us. There is nothing in our pasts that He cannot make whole, and indeed the places that we are most ashamed of can be just the ones that God uses most for our healing and His glory. We just have to learn that in His eyes we are each beloved, accepted, and cherished. Just the way we are!I received this book from BookSneeze.com in exchange for this honest review.

This is told in the third person from several different characters\u2019 perception, and it works very well. This was one book that would not have worked in first-person, even if it had two (or more) perspectives. It would\u2019ve been hard to follow. How it\u2019s written, though, is perfect and made reading it very enjoyable.While the summary mentions Kelli and Heather, the story seems to be more about Kelli \u2013 and Brian \u2013 than Heather. Heather\u2019s story is important, and does tie in with Kelli\u2019s, but it\u2019s more on the periphery of the book. Kelli and Brian are most often at the center. And I think it works, because their story is far more interesting, far more heartbreaking, and has far greater impact when reading.Cherished shows that no matter what lies in our past, God still loves us. He forgives us. And He still can \u2013 and will \u2013 use us. We also see the power of forgiveness in our human relationships, and how relationships can be restored through God\u2019s grace and love.Once the big bomb was dropped, I couldn\u2019t get the song Lucy by Skillet out of my head. (My apologies if you know the story behind that song, as that will prove a small spoiler. However, even if you hear the song, the lyrics won\u2019t give it away. Only the story behind the song will.)There were times while reading that I kept thinking that everything was too easy, too sunshiny, too perfect. But then if I\u2019d stop and think about it I\u2019d remember that it isn\u2019t. There are some disappointments, some failed dreams, and some tough times that occur during the story (in addition to working through past mistakes).Overall, Cherished is a hope-filled, uplifting story about God\u2019s grace in our lives and how He can take any of our mistakes and use them for His glory."}, {"userName": "Belindachaplin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183215-belindachaplin", "userReview": "Kim Cash Tate's \"Cherished\" is a wonderful novel about second chances and finding one's true self in Christ. I originally reviewed her book \"Faithful\" in 2010, and so it was no surprise to me to find myself once again totally engrossed in the characters, the story and the wonderful message of this novel. Cherished is about the fact that God loves us, and cherishes us, even when we don't always do the right thing. Kelli is not sure what she wants out of life, but the last thing she wants is to have anything to do with her ex-boyfriend Brian. He is the reason she is hurt, beat-up and not wanting to follow the calling God has on her life into music. Heather has no self-esteem left after always falling for the wrong guys...Both need to remember how much God loves them, and we are also reminded of that as the story unfolds. Also through the story we are reminded that we need to forgive others just as He forgave us... Unforgiveness is a poison you drink expecting the other person to die... and instead it ends up hurting you more. I think we all need to remember that lesson! I don't want to give away the rest of the story, so you will just have to read for yourself... and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did ;-)Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze\u00ae.com  book review bloggers program.

There are some good topics included in CHERISHED, messages we need to hear as Ms. Tate reminds us that if we ask God to forgive our sins, He is capable of forgiving even the worst mistake we make and not only forgiving them, but He can also still love us. Not being either urban or black, there are some slang in this book I didn\u2019t fully \u2018get\u2019, which detracted from my enjoyment of the book. There were also a lot of characters to keep track of. I really struggled through this book, and didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as I would have liked to.

Results are already being seen in the lives of those who have read this wonderful book.

You can find all the details, an interview and hear the song at Kim's blog: http://www.kimcashtate.com/2011/08/of... .It's definitely worth checking out her webpage to hear a powerful testimony by this young rapper who found restoration, redemption and the healing of his marriage through Christ Jesus.
