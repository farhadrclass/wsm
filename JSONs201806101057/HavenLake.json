This author is a wonderful storyteller, and she lays out a moving story about family, loss, misunderstandings and finally forgiveness and redemption. This is the type of book that transports the reader to a different time and place. I would classify this novel under the genre of chick-lit, historical fiction, romance and all mixed up with a good dose of family drama.\u201cThe problem was marrying someone was that you married his problems, too. \u201cSydney Bishop, a psychologist has been engaged to Dr. Gary Katz, a surgeon for two years. Dylan is her fiance\u2019s sixteen year old son, from a previous marriage. Sydney has tried hard to reach out to Dylan, and build a relationship, often left to watch over Dylan, as Gary\u2019s hours at the hospital are more demanding. But then one day, Dylan skips school after his first class, and hitchhikes to Seattle \u2014to Haven Lake and her mother Hannah\u2019s sheep farm. Sydney hasn\u2019t returned to Haven Lake, since she was sixteen, when tragedy struck the family.So Sydney is forced to go back to Haven Lake, to bring Dylan home, but in doing so must face her own past. I enjoyed the complexity of the relationships of the characters and the way the plot unfolded over time, just as in life.This is a well written, story of real life. Love, betrayal, finding and losing loved ones. Hannah is my favourite character, a very loving, strong lady, who gives life to this book. This is a story of two families torn apart by death. Both families must come to terms with what really happened before they can move on. This separation, in both cases, between parent and child, needs to be healed.I like that the story presents real characters, that are not perfect, that all have their own baggage, and have to come to terms with their own situation. Overall, it was an enjoyable moving story, for those readers that love a good family drama."}, {"userName": "Nancy Brady", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2870158-nancy-brady", "userReview": "Full disclosure: I received this novel as a First Reads Goodreads giveaway, but that in no way affects this review.4.5 stars--Lies, recriminations, teenage angst, suicide, reconciliation, redemption, and so much more can be found in this novel. Sydney has not been back home to Haven Lake in twenty years, but she goes in an attempt to bring her soon-to-be stepson Dylan home.There she deals not only with an angst-ridden teen, but also with her past history with her mother Hannah. She is truly caught in the middle especially when her fiance' Gary and she are at odds of how to deal with Dylan.The novel is beautifully written with descriptions so vivid Haven Lake comes to life.

Robinson is a gifted writer who seamlessly weaves complex storylines that cover present day and a past in the 70\u2019s during the Vietnam War era, where PTSD and the free love social movement involving drugs and self-sustaining communes are examined. Haven Lake is a beautiful and unique setting for this book\u2014I thoroughly enjoyed learning tidbits about organic farming and raising sheep. Robinson characters are imperfect but achingly human. Adult daughter Sydney ran away from the lake as a teenager yet her fianc\u00e9\u2019s troubled teenage son Dylan finds refuge there. It\u2019s a place that holds both sad and happy memories for Sydney and her mother Hannah. Robinson covers the gamut of emotions in this story-love, anger, resentment, fear and forgiveness. Family relationships are complicated, messy and always evolving. Robinson confidently taps into the fears and hopes of each of her characters as they struggle to find the right path forward for themselves. The story opens with a family torn apart and ends with a family reunited. I highly recommend this novel!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4247182-elizabeth", "userReview": "I won this book through the GoodReads First Reads program.I am a huge fan of Holly Robinson. I'm not sure why it took me so long to read this book. I think I was saving it for when I had time to spend - and I'm glad I waited. It was not an easy book to read. The relationships between the characters are complicated and sometimes painfully so. Sydney, in particular, has so many unrealized issues with her family and has fallen in love with a very dysfunctional surgeon, yet she does not realize why she became involved with him until later in the book. Dylan, the surgeon's son, has many problems stemming from things involving family. Yet, the author brings all their stories together through the happenings at Haven Lake. This book is full of amazing characters and beautiful settings. The interaction of the characters and storyline is emotionally charged and full of surprises. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Anne Martin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32648608-anne-martin", "userReview": "A nice read, no question for me. I know people -some of them st least- will disagree, because... well, let's try and see :-it is chick-lit. Yep, but as 50% of the persons, I am a chick!-not worth reading 400 pages of characters' analysis. That's part of what I mostly enjoy when reading. Why did they act or react like that, was it the right idea, what would have happened if...-the mystery is easily solved. No one said it's a thriller. It is not a suspense book.-nothing happens. Well, a lot of things happen, and forty years go by. If you don't care for family sagas or books about every day life, then, this one is not for you. But it sounds like me when I complain about the violence n James Bond's movies. You know ahead what it will be like.-the characters are not likable. I disagree, they are human, with strengths and weaknesses. They sound real they make mistakes. If they were perfect, it would be meaningless.-the characters are not real. Being off the grid like Hannah, or smitten like Dylan does not exist. For those of you who are 20 or less, you live with your phone in your hand 15 hours a day. But people a few yeas older don't care that much about social networking.And for those who have forgotten how a teenager feels, just remember the intensity of the feelings you had at that age!So, you have a volume retracing the life of a mother and he daughter, during almost 40 years. The choices they make, the ones life makes for them, the weight of randomness and exterior events on one's life are depicted and I did sympathize with Hannah, Sidney and Dylan. I thought the only one portrayed a bit as a cliche was Dylan's father, Gary, although he gets better defined close to the end of the book. And, of course,Granny Bishop, who is just evil.Why 4 stars and not 5, then? First, 4 stars for me, means I really liked it, and 5 means it is exceptional. This book reminded me (except the Judaism, non-existent here) of some written by Belva Plain, or maybe Kristin Hannah, or Debbie Macomber. I mean, I've read books before I can compare to this one, and I liked most of them.Second, I was betting from the first pages she would not marry Gary but Marco. It could have been a bit less obvious.Third, historically, regarding the Vietnam war, the dating is a bit off. Rory was too young to possibly have been drafted, and even Allen would never have been drafted, had he attended college. The whole story would have been more believable with Hannah, Rory and Allen 5 years older. To add a last little touch of criticism, I would have liked the female characters to be a bit more on the feminist side. If the 1960's and early 70's were the time of hippies and free love, they were also the moments when feminism began. We don't hear much about it here.But it remains an excellent read, enjoyable for most."}, {"userName": "Dee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177726-dee", "userReview": "Review Copy Provided by AuthorThis is a hard review for me to write because Holly Robinson has been a favorite author of mine since I read her book The Wishing Hill a couple of years ago, so when I got my hands on Haven Lake I was excited to dig on it. In fact, when I received my copy of it, I had a picture posted on twitter within about 10 minutes of opening the package. But when it came to reading it, I don\u2019t know if I wasn\u2019t in the right mood, or there was something that just wasn\u2019t working for me, but I struggled with the initial stages. At one stage early on (I was maybe about 40 pages in), I put it down because I was struggling and there is sat, glaring at me from my bedside table for probably a good month or so (books rarely last that long as a current read). But on a snowy weekend, I curled up with Haven Lake and after I got past the chapter or so that I was stuck on, the rest of my reading was pretty much smooth sailing.Much like her previous books, Haven Lake is a woman\u2019s exploration into her life \u2013 what has gone wrong? what has gone right? what does she need to change to be where she wants to be? But I had issues relating to Sydney \u2013 I just felt like she wasn\u2019t relatable \u2013 in fact, she was (at least to me an unfeeling bitch). She may have become slightly more redeemable as the book progressed for the most part, but honestly, yeah, I could have cared less.I was much more interested in both Hannah and Sydney\u2019s soon to be step-son, Dylan \u2013 they were to me the more interesting of the cast of characters. I\u2019m always intrigued by people who decide to live off the grid (and while Hannah wasn\u2019t completely off, she was fairly well unplugged) \u2013 mostly because I know I could never do it. I like my phone, my computer, Facebook, Starbucks etc wayyy to much ;) I also liked how Holly developed Dylan\u2019s character \u2013 all I wanted to do while I was reading his portion was wrap him up in a huge hug (and then bitch-slap his father\u2026). He reminded me of Gigi in Holly\u2019s other book, Beach Plum Island. As a writer she has the troubled teen character very well developed (and they don\u2019t seem to be cardboard cut-outs of each other, each are unique).I ended up giving Haven Lake 3.5 stars because of my thoughts about Sydney through-out, since she was the main character and I just struggled to like her. As well as the fact that I very easily put this down and wasn\u2019t in any rush to pick it back up, like I did with previous books by Holly. While I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as previous books, I think reader\u2019s who like women\u2019s lit may enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Linda Branich", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19419740-linda-branich", "userReview": "I received this book at no charge from a Good Reads First Reads giveaway, but this fact in no way influenced my review.Some may dispute how I catagorized this book, but I feel the essence of it falls into those categories. I laugh at the historical fiction part, because I am at an age now where my youth and the things that happened then are history!Holly Robinson carefully weaves her tale between the present and the past. One moment life contains computers, cell phones, video games, striving for success by achieving professional goals, expensive clothing and cars, and the next flashes back to the 70's---Vietnam and the impact of this 'war' ( social unrest and PTSD), free love, communes, drugs, and 'doing your own thing'. This is a story of great love, great tragedy and sadness, forgiveness and self forgiveness, of picking up the pieces and trying to move forward, and great anger. Events of the past are mirrored in events of the present: first sex, drugs, unexpected death, loss of self worth, an attempting to crawl out of a mental abysmal hole. Sydney, an educational psychologist, is engaged to mary Gary, a successful surgeon and widower. Gary's teenaged son, Dylan, has a social meltdown and runs away. He winds up asking Sydney's Mom, from whom Sydney has been estranged for many years, to let him spend the night. Sydney hasn't been to her Mom's farm, Haven Lake, since for 20 years, not since she was 16. Memories flood back for Sydney and Hannah (her Mom) and old wounds are opened up. The animosities between Hannah and Sydney are paralled between Gary and Dylan; both parents and offspring must get to the root of their problems.I rated this book a good solid 4 stars. Even if you are not a member of either generation in this book, it is a great read. If you are, you may find that you do a little looking at yourself."}, {"userName": "Tonya Helser", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32019688-tonya-helser", "userReview": "*Goodreads firstreads giveaway*Haven Lake Is the type of book that transports the reader to a different time and place.

Although she had many ghosts, she was able to forge ahead, begin new relationships and mend a messy past. I really liked the raw desrcription of that crazy thing we call love and the many levels that love can be. This was a great book that captured and held my attention.

Sydney has been estranged from her mother Hannah since she was a teenager, after 2 tragedies occurred at Haven Lake, the family farm. Haven Lake was also a place of free love and drugs in the 70s when her parents opened up their farm to anyone who wanted to live there and work the land. Sydney is now engaged to a successful doctor, whose teenage son, Dylan, runs away, taking refuge with Hannah at Haven Lake. This sets off a series of events which ultimately reveal the truth about what happened at the farm, which caused the rift between Sydney and Hannah. As they come to terms with the past, everyone is also trying to deal with the future, and how they can look past their own hidden demons, buried secrets, and make peace with each other. There are lots of twists and turns in this book, as Sydney and Hannah both realize that nothing is black and white, and that in order to get back to each other, they need to unbury the past.

It is also a story of two women hopscotching around making the decision of whether they want to heal the 20-year breach in their relationship and if so \u2013 how?Dylan seemed like the average teen, except he was still grieving the death of his mother that occurred a few years prior. He had accepted Sydney in his dad\u2019s life, and Gary and Sydney both thought that Dylan was okay with their upcoming nuptials. Something was seriously troubling Dylan, and he not only ran away from home, but he contacted Hannah, Sydney\u2019s off- the-grid shepherdess mother, and asked to stay there.Sydney called her mother Hannah for most of her life \u2013 when they spoke, that is. Hannah has tried to again be part of Sydney\u2019s life, even meeting her fiance, Gary. Dylan brought mother and daughter together, albeit not by Sydney\u2019s preference, and Hannah is not going to give up on her. Hannah was a child of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, including the tumultuous years of the Vietnam war and its effects on her late husband Allen, experimenting with drugs, and the dropout lifestyle espoused by the disillusioned. Hannah and Allen had originally called the pond on their land Haven Lake, wanting the farm to be their haven from post-war America.Sydney\u2019s childhood and her mother had seemed magical when she was young, but now she understands how unusual it was, and rarely shares details with anyone in her life. Sydney left Haven Lake when she was a teen, after two terrible deaths about which she never truth \u2013 or recovered from it. After those deaths, Hannah drank herself into a breakdown and psych ward, leaving Sydney no choice but to live with her father\u2019s parents. She had no way of knowing that her grandparents had secrets that Hannah had tried to protect her from, and secrets that later kept Hannah and Sydney apart from loved ones and each other.Holly Robinson\u2019s prose sings, her words painting pictures in the mind of the reader. Her descriptives invites one to look for the poetry and the colors in life. Some of the characters\u2019 thoughts and ideals are tongue-in-cheek humor, others are irony. The characters are an eccentric group. Each has been broken by circumstances beyond their control, with jagged shards still painfully working to the surface. Dylan\u2019s genuine self is much closer to the being released than those of the adults, and he fights to be real and accepted just as desperately as he tries to fit into a world he doesn\u2019t understand.Watching the characters interact and change as a result of Dylan\u2019s behaviors is worth the read. Seeing Hannah and Sydney tentatively reach out to each other after two decades makes one want to pick up the phone and connect with parents or children who, while they may not be estranged, keep their authentic selves hidden from each other.Haven Lake is complex, with two primary plots and lesser subplots that are skillfully introduced and woven together into the whole of the work. While they try to help Dylan, he is reaching out through his struggles to help Hannah and Sydney communicate and be the mother and daughter they were so many years ago. Sydney tries to find the truth about her father and her best friend\u2019s deaths \u2013 but is the truth more than she or Hannah can bear?Learning about sheep and organic farming through Hannah\u2019s eyes was interesting, as was seeing Hannah and Dylan open up to each other. There were times that I wondered if there was hope for anything positive in the lives of any of the characters. Yet they continued to try, and that trying itself demonstrated hope for the future. One disappointment for me was that some of the language was offensive but I skidded around it and proceed. Due to a few sexually explicit scenes, this reader suggests that this novel may not be appropriate for younger teens.I do recommend this novel for adults of any age who appreciate the challenges that broken people face and may triumph over if willing to see the truth. There is beauty in Holly Robinson\u2019s writing that is not to be missed, and she brings delightful surprises that readers will appreciate.Those who try to make amends with parents or children also will see demonstrated how to reach through their generational differences and love again.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Lyn (Readinghearts)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124637-lyn-readinghearts", "userReview": "NOTE: A copy of this book was provided by the author and publisher in exchange for an honest review.I have read several of Holly Robinson's books over the last few years. I started with The Wishing Hill: A Novel the story of three women whose lives are linked in an unusual yet unbreakable way. That was followed by Beach Plum Island a story of three sisters whose lives are linked and who are just beginning to understand the meaning of the word \"family\". Recently I had the privilege of reading a third book by Holly, Haven Lake, published April 2015 by NAL, $15.00 US. I am pleased to say that I think this is Holly's best work yet. Like all of Holly's books that I have read, Haven Lake is a story about people, the connections that they make, and what actually constitutes a family. In this case, we are introduced to Sydney Bishop, a women who left home at the age of sixteen after a pair of tragic deaths tore her family apart, and her mother, Hannah Bishop, a sheep farmer who still lives at the family farm where Sydney grew up. Sydney is currently a child psychologist working with troubled students and engaged to marry Gary, a top notch surgeon with a teenage son. The story unfolds as Sydney tries to forge a bond with Dylan, Gary's son, and steer clear of her mother and their strained relationship. As I stated in my other reviews of her books, Holly Robinson's strengths are the characters that she develops in her stories, and the actual flow of the stories themselves. In that respect, this book is no different. The main characters, Sydney, Hannah, and Dylan are all amazingly complex characters with a lot of depth and many facets in their personalities. In fact, even the minor characters, Sydney's fiancee Gary, her grandmother, Hannah's friend and neighbor, Liz, and Dylan's crush are all complex and interesting in their own right. In fact, there is not a single character in this book that did not do something surprising at one point or another. The fact that the characters in the story were unpredictable at times only made them seem more real and allowed me to connect with them all the more. As for the story itself, Haven Lake is once again filled with plenty of emotion...love, loss, betrayal, and enough twists and turns to make the story a page turner.There were, however, two big differences that set this book apart and made it, for me, the best effort from Holly Robinson yet. First were the male characters in this book. I felt that the male characters in this book were more developed and played a bigger role in the flow of the story. I was especially happy with the character of Dylan, as he is the first male character that has been used as the stories focus among the Holly Robinson books that I have read, and he was an excellent one at that. The second reason that this book resonated with me more than some of the others has to do with the last quarter of the book, and the ultimate ending. There were so many things revealed about the characters in this section of the book that made for a fascinating read. In addition, the ending of this book was so realistic. One thing that I really appreciate, is authors who do not succumb to the urge to always give books an ending where everything works out perfectly. Don't get me wrong, I love happy endings, but I also appreciate realistic endings where you see that the characters still have decisions to make and journeys to go through. In this respect, I found the ending to this story very satisfying. The next Holly Robinson book on my list to read is Chance Harbor, which I highly anticipating. Over the course of time as I have been reading Holly's books, I have become a true fan of her stories and look forward to much more from her in the future."}, {"userName": "Viviane Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682057-viviane-crystal", "userReview": "Sydney Bishop is a successful child psychologist who finds herself in the oddest of conundrums.

The idea that Sydney stayed away from Haven Lake for twenty years just to avoid dealing with everything that happen there was shattering. The life she grew up with was different from the \u201cnormal\u201d, but it was her life and she loved it. The memories she had before that horrible series of events were perfect and she loved them. When things went bad, they went really bad. Sydney is a strong character. She was able to escape her past and make herself successful in the real world. Yet, she has to deal with her past. Gary, Sydney\u2019s fianc\u00e9, is not a likable character. He is very selfish and standoffish. I understand that he also has some past that he is trying to deal with. Yet, he does nothing to help his fianc\u00e9, other than criticize her every move, or his son, Dylan. I struggled with everything that Gary said and wanted Sydney to just get out of that relationship. By the end of the story, I felt that he was coming around, but still had a long way to go.Dylan is by far my favorite character. He was dealt a horribly blow when his mother was killed in an accident. He strikes out against those who love him and are trying to keep him safe. Yet, he manages to stand on his own two feet and be himself. He finds what he loves and proves to himself and everyone else that he is not a lost cause. As a teenager, he gets his life together and I have no doubt he will become successful. This is a long book. But every page is wonderful. I started it and could not put it down.

Holly Robinson knows how to make you feel for the characters with the loves that hve gone awry, from bitterness, hostility, grief and distancing, because of past secrets and events, to love that was like smoldering embers of a fire that never went out. Holly writes with passion and endearment for animals as well as humans that tug at your heart. I found myself smiling and loving Casper, the sheep that Dylan so boldly saved from slaughter, to loving the little woodchuck Oscar, who is a house pet that begs to be held and fed. I had empathy for Sydney who is an educational psychologist who strives hard to help her future husband's son Dylan who is going through a crisis and runs away to stay with Sydney's mom, whom she has not seen or spoken to in years. I loved Hannah, Sydney's mom who fosters a wonderful relationship with Dylan, much to Gary, his father's disdain. Gary, disciplines with harshness, and not a likeable character, seeing things completely opposite of what Sydney sees. At times I wanted to shake Sydney for her stubbornness, and wondered if she would ever see her part in this family crisis as well as she saw things clearly in her own professional life. The heartaches in this story are real, Allen who suffered the ravages of Post-Vietnam PTSD which threatens his relationship with his wife Hannah and the secrets they both kept brought a pain that is palpable.

Hannah lives on a sheep farm, a place her daughter, Sydney hasn\u2019t visited in decades, not since it was a commune, the place where Sydney lost two people she loved, and so she and her mother aren\u2019t on the best of terms.Haven Lake is told from Sydney, Dylan, and Hannah\u2019s viewpoints, each voice true to their age, gender, and personality, Dylan particularly stood out, with his awkwardness and his emotions, how he\u2019s intuitive about some things, and so very na\u00efve about others (his crush).While Hannah\u2019s mother-in-law felt a bit one-note to me, I really enjoyed the other characters, their well-meaning hearts, alongside their stubbornness and tendancy to say or do things they regret, made them feel like actual flawed people. I also found it refreshing that a boy struggled with eating issues here, when usually that\u2019s treated like it\u2019s only a girl thing.The pace was a bit leisurely, at times I felt as though I was ahead of the plot, waiting for it to catch up, certain things were apparent to me long before they were apparent to these characters who seemed smart enough to connect the dots sooner than they did. That said, a slower pace does leave room for a rich sense of place and to explore the characters, to really see what makes them tick.I received this ARC through a Goodreads giveaway."}, {"userName": "Kelly Smith Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11560119-kelly-smith-reviews", "userReview": "I received an advance copy of Haven Lake from the publisher for an honest review.First of all, let me say that while I read everything, if I went to a bookstore right now, this would not be my first choice. In fact, had I not been asked to review this, there's a chance that I might've never read it, and that would've been a real shame, because Haven Lake is an excellent book with the deepest emotions running through it like a river.What's funny is, though the plot is driven by the characters, the plot was better than the characters.Dylan and Sydney are very normal people, you might live next door to them. Hannah is a bit more unique and outrageous, and she was very enjoyable. I think it was the mix of normalcy and mystery that really brought this story together as a cohesive whole. You had Sydney's story, Hannah's storyband Dylan's story. Each would've made an excellent individual novella, but somehow Ms. Robinson managed to tie them all together into one beautiful book.The story starts out strong, levels out for awhile and then you get hit with a shocker even I didn't see coming. Don't let the women's fiction part get you: this is, in every way, a mystery. It just happens to have a little more heart than your typical mystery novel.An excellent book, and one you'll want to share with your loved ones!"}, {"userName": "Debbie Payne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27092775-debbie-payne", "userReview": "I receive Haven Lake as a Goodreads Giveaway in exchange for an honest review. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Holly Robinson is a wonderful storyteller and made you really want to like or dislike the characters throughout the book.There is something for everyone in this book; young and old alike as it spans a couple of generations and she did a great job of connecting those generations to each other. I was sad to see all those characters go when the book ended. It wasn't meant to be a thriller but rather a very well-wriiten blend of chick-lit, historical fiction, romance and commentaries on such themes of long-held secrets,bullying, anorexia, drugs then and now, marriage -- you name it and it is all wrapped up tightly in this book. I know the area of the country she sets her characters in and I can almost see myself back at a certain Shelbourne Farm in Vermont in the spring with all those lambs clumsily walking around the grounds. That part of the country is just perfect and her descriptions and quite good and evoke memories of my time short time in Vermont.I would recommend this book to just about everyone. My book club would love it as it has so many important concepts to talk about. I am hoping to read her other books as well, sometime in the near future."}, {"userName": "Caren ~ the misfit geek", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8489119-caren-the-misfit-geek", "userReview": "This book started a little bit slow for me but picked up fairly quickly. I enjoyed it quite a bit once I made it past the first few chapters. Overall, it moved along pretty smoothly and I appreciated how the story developed as it progressed. The author did a good job of alluding to facts that were later revealed in more detail. I found myself wondering what was really going on and then a while later saying \u201cOh, that makes more sense now\u201d.Holly Robinson is always gifted at character development and presenting interpersonal relationships. She is particularly brilliant with complicated family relationships. This book did a great job of highlighting this particular talent. Robinson tackled the tricky relationship between parent and grown child. I liked the parallel of Sydney losing her father and Dylan losing his mother at around the same stage in life for both of them. I really wish Robinson would have concentrated more on that in the story.I would definitely recommend this book. It is a great story about the healing power of forgiveness.

Sydney is an educational psychologist and Hannah (her mother) is raising sheep. There is quite a difference in there professions and their alternative family structures. Vietnam serves as an important backdrop for Haven Lake. Dylan (Sydney's fianc\u00e9' teenage son) is a troubled teen who has lost his mother. Dylan tries to control the one thing in his life that he can which is how much he eats. Gary (Dylan's dad) wants Dylan to spend less time playing video games. Dylan finally has had enough, so he decides to go on a hitch hiking journey that leads him to Haven Lake and Sydney's mom Hannah. Life at Haven Lake is totally different at Haven Lake where Hannah lives nearly off the grid. There is little time to spend watching TV or using a computer. Hannah raises her own food an is unplugged from most of the world. Hannah and Sydney are both torn between two men (Hannah between Rory and Allen) and (Sydney between Marco and Gary). They both experience many conflicts in their relationships!

Sydney Bishop left her family home in Haven Lake after two tragic deaths of those close to her family when she was just a teen. Now in her mid-thirties, she has yet to return to Haven Lake since the tragedies occurred. Sydney is forced to confront her past when her fianc\u00e9's son Dylan's hitchhiking journey finds him visiting her mother, Hannah, at Haven Lake. Holly Robinson has woven a tale that touches on themes of identity, redemption, family, grief, and love that many will enjoy. The book covers the perspectives of many of the characters, which drew me into the plot and developed the characters. The relationships between Dylan and Sydney, Dylan and Hannah, and Sydney and love-interest Marco were well-developed and added to my enjoyment of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a heartwarming read."}, {"userName": "Hazelj jones", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32130209-hazelj-jones", "userReview": "I received this book in a giveaway on Good Reads!I really loved this book ..The characters in this story could part of any house on any street in my town .

But, I do not want to give away too much. Holly Robinson describes situations in a way that make you feel you are right in the middle and these situations could be in your own family. Now, will there be a sequel? The book ended in such a way, Holly Robinson could write a sequel, Did Sydney and Marco get together, does Dylan take over the farm? Haven Lake is really a good novel.
