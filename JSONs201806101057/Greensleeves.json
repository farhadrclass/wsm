But every once in a while you pick up a story\u2014some simple, unassuming book\u2014and something about it sinks deep within you, and lodges there. Such is Greensleeves.I won't deny it; Greensleeves hurts, because it is honest. It's chockfull of gentle but unflinching insights into human nature. These can be hilarious, charming, tender, or excruciating by turn. I felt\u2014and I suspect that anyone who has ever felt alone or adrift (that is, everyone) would feel similarly\u2014as though I were reading a fictional account of my own struggles and insights over the last few years. Like life, Greensleeves doesn't give easy answers, and there lies its strength, and its ultimate beauty. I very much recommend the story. I hope you read it. But if you do, be prepared to take good, long, hard look at yourself, or you'll miss the story's power. Its currency is honesty.

Last Thursday, I came across a link to this review on Twitter. Odd, because I rarely actually scroll through my Twitter feed, and even more rarely click on any links (unless they're behind-the-scenes information on Doctor Who; those I can scarcely resist). I suppose it was the author name that intrigued me: Eloise Jarvis McGraw. Since the review made it sound incredibly interesting, it was $1.99 on kindle, I still have gift card (I tend to hoard it for moments like this), I'd really enjoyed the author's The Golden Goblet and Moccasin Trail and my library doesn't have Greensleeves, I decided on impulse to buy it. It's definitely for a different audience than those books; those are middle grade historical fiction and Newbery Honors. Greensleeves is a 60s teen contemporary novel with a dash of mystery and intrigue and a lot about finding direction in life. I rarely read contemporary teen fiction, 50 years old or otherwise. If I read any era of contemporary, it's usually middle grade. As for teen fiction, I have a friend who reads a lot of it and her reviews are usually enough to steel my determination to avoid it. A lot of the teen fiction books I hear about sound wildly inappropriate, my main reason for avoiding them, other than the fact that I generally enjoy adventure the most. Greensleeves certainly isn't. There is kissing in the book, and Shan does analyze how different guys make her feel, but it's rather less than what's in The Hunger Games. (In case you're wondering why I make the comparison, since I also did it in my Cinderella post, THG is basically my as-far-as-I'll-go-on-Content, which I realize isn't incredibly far.)I have a lot of unread books on my kindle, yes, bought ones as well as free ones. It's mostly typical for me to download a book and let it sit there. However, Saturday came and since I'd spent Friday out in the woods with my sisters and our friend filming an impromptu movie, stayed up past midnight to show her Star Wars, and then gotten up earlier than I would have liked so I'd be up before her parents came to pick her up, following that up with a trip to the post office and several hours editing our movie, and a 45 minute nap (I never take naps) because I was so tired, I really didn't feel like trudging through the really old books that don't get good until halfway through, and I wanted something different. Besides, Greensleeves had intrigued me. So I did little else from that late afternoon until late Sunday afternoon besides read that book. (Of course I didn't read it during church, just to and from church.) I really enjoyed it. Shannon is a girl who really doesn't know what she wants out of life. I'm sure everyone's felt that way at some point. And even though I do know what I want from life and I am pursuing some of those things, I still can't help feeling directionless and like I'm waiting for something to happen. Shan goes under cover to help her Uncle Frosty investigate a strange will, but also because she's tired of Shan Lightley and her problems, and just wants to be someone else for awhile. She's trying to find herself. While I don't exactly identify with her struggle for identity, I can understand her fears that people wouldn't like her if they knew the real her. Probably why I liked it, besides the natural intrigue of the peculiar will and the interesting, varied people named in it which is bound to excite me, is because I can understand her struggles. I have to say, though, my favorite character is Sherry. Gone are the days when I didn't like guy characters simply because they were guys. Sherry (his full name is George Maynard Sherrill) is an interesting guy. He\u2019s good and smart and intellectual, kind of shy, very perceptive, extremely curious, and he wants to learn just to know things. He studied Greek because he wanted to know how people in Greece sounded. He wanted to learn integral calculus so he would know what people were talking about when they said \u201cintegral calculus.\u201d I didn\u2019t like Dave Kulka. He kind of reminded me of Dean Priest from the Emily of New Moon books by L. M. Montgomery, and that\u2019s not exactly a good association. The characters are all very well developed, and so is the little world Shan stepped into when she went to College Street and became Georgetta Einszweiler Smith. It all felt so real. Greensleeves is a good book. The ending was slightly unsatisfactory due to being a bit inconclusive, but I guess I can make up my own epilogue. I\u2019d say it\u2019s geared towards older teen girls and that\u2019s probably the best audience for it, but I would recommend it. It gave me a nice weekend and some food for thought.For more reviews from me and my sisters, visit www.shirereviews.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Karin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048682-karin", "userReview": "Shannon Lightly has just graduated from high school after a life time of living in Europe and the US, either with her mother, her father or her aunt. She has been everywhere in Europe, but when she is about to fly back overseas from Portland, she realizes she is really nowhere and isn't even sure of who she is and what she wants to do. She turns to her \"Uncle\" Frosty, who suggests she take the summer off, and ends up helping him discover what is up with a rather unusual will that he has been hired to contest. She decides to go undercover, gets a job as a waitress and lives right among some of the potential legatees. Bear in mind that this was written and set in the 1960s, when you could do that and be paid from the till.Although Shannon has traveled alone from one parent to another, this is the first time she is really and truly on her own, and while trying earnestly to gather information, she meets Sherry (George Maynard Sherrill) who takes to her immediately.It's easy to see, while reading this, why Eloise Jarvis McGraw, who won the Newberry Honor three times in as many decades, published so many books; she knew how to write. This has been republished as a Nancy Pearl \"Book Crush Rediscovery\" and I would say is worth it."}, {"userName": "Anna Ilona", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17812040-anna-ilona", "userReview": "The pacing of the prologue-like first chapter aside, I slipped easily into the world of this book and would have liked to remain there longer. Our eighteen-year-old heroine is a girl who has been haphazardly raised by seven different parent-figures, including her divorced father and mother, while being dragged up and down across Europe. When in Europe, she is perceived to be an American; while in the States, she is seen as European. She is a girl who doesn\u2019t know who she is. Our story opens with her desperate attempt to hit the pause button and escape for a time from her own awkward identity before she is pushed into a college education she does not want. She will be a detective. In disguise. The story is told with charm, wit, and perceptiveness. Our heroine may be filled with angst, but it is a self-aware, rather mature angst that does not exaggerate her own importance or sap her sense of humor. Many aspects of this late-1960\u2019s world are delightful. The way trendy blue eye-shadow and a massive hair-do, well glued-up, are used by our heroine to create a mask is fun to read about. The way daily life is conducted with a complete lack of modern screens is striking. The characters\u2019 moral universe is appealing. They assume that love leads to marriage and that playing with sexual contact in the form of kissing and making-out is to awaken a deep, heavy, potentially dangerous thing that robs people of the ability to properly evaluate their mutual compatibility. Yet the overall message of the story left me feeling ambiguous. Essentially, it is a well-presented, charming manifestation of the idea that life\u2019s purpose is to find and know oneself. This must be done as an individual, and involves escape from other people\u2019s undue influence (in the imagery of the novel, one must \u201cescape one\u2019s own cage\u201d--the personal fears and insecurities that hold one imprisoned--without the help of friends, parents, or true love, because no one can save us from ourselves). Marriage is something to consider only after both parties have first pursued their own dreams and discovered who they truly are. This message is all the more powerful because, rather than being assumed, it is discovered by the heroine in a slow and non-preachy way. Unfortunately, the author forgets that the search for truth (including about oneself) is not best pursued only through individualism. Community and revealed beliefs are an important part of this process.There is some truth to the book\u2019s thesis that we can\u2019t save each other and that we must find our own inner courage, and I am ready enough to accept the idea that these particular characters really did need to make the choices they did. The problem is that nowadays, it is assumed that everyone needs to make such choices. My final feeling is that this would make a good book to read and discuss with one\u2019s teenage daughters, but not perhaps to hand them and leave undiscussed."}, {"userName": "Janice (Janicu)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20432-janice-janicu", "userReview": "This is a growing pains type of book, something that makes you look at being a young adult stuggling with growing up in a different way, maybe in a wring you out kind of way. Possibly the only other books that made me feel this way would be the series by Megan McCafferty. Sherwood Smith, author of Inda and Crown and Court Duel has recommended it on livejournal (http://community.livejournal.com/atha...) and describes it very well - \"Greensleeves had what I considered the very best illustration of the difference between love and mere (or not so mere) attraction that I have EVER seen. And that included very wide reading in adult books at that time. In fact, much of the popular adult literature I read in the sixties mixed the two--usually mistaking attraction-at-first-sight for actual love, which usually ends in tragedy in real life. The thing about Greensleeves is that it is a delightful story, not the least bit preachy, and not a single inappropriate word or action, though it deals so directly with potentially strong material. I thought Jarvis a genius. And more clearsighted than many so-called adult writers.The story, briefly, is about a girl named Shannon whose divorced parents are both famous. So she's spent time partly in Europe, partly in a small town in USA. She feels like she doesn't fit anywhere. When it comes time for college, she panics. So her 'uncle' hires her to go in disguise to this tiny college town to investigate a very peculiar will. There is no danger involved, just a very odd set of circumstances around this will, and he wants to know if the recently deceased elderly lady was sane, or coerced, or what.So Shannon makes up this ridiculous persona, and goes off to investigate, getting a job as a waitress. Among the distinctive characters she meets are two guys . . . well, I'll stop there. \""}, {"userName": "Sharla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11905458-sharla", "userReview": "This book touched my soul.I rarely find a story that is not only captivating to read, but also speaks to me. It was as if it was spoken in language I'd been speaking my whole life. A language I wasn't aware even existed until I heard someone using the words I'd known all along.Here is a \"kindred spirit\" if you wish. Eloise Jarvis Mcgraw is gone. But I feel as if she and I would have been good friends. Someone who saw life in full color and wistfulness. With all the dreamy, poetic touches that people find so repulsive. Now that I think about it, all of her books hold a sort of dreamy wistfulness to them. I think that's what I always found most appealing. The fact that she didn't see life flat and dull, but as shifting and elusive as a cloud in the sky. If that makes any sense?Pros:Sherry. I don't think I've found a character this appealing in ages. From the minute he entered the story I found him captivating. His insatiable curiosity, languid manners, and gentle kindness all created a vivid picture of this human unlike any other character I've read.\u00a0Shannon Lightly. She was very relatable. Even though this book was written in a different time frame and set in a different era I still felt a certain kinship to her. The story is what they call a \"coming of age\" story I think. I personally find those labels annoying, but that is what people label this story and I can understand why. Every moment is leading up to her finding herself, who she is, her purpose. Thankfully the book never comes to an explicit conclusion. Still, it raises more questions about what it means to live and learn and be a human. Shannon, throughout the whole story changes quite dramatically, yet she also remains unchanged in many aspects.\u00a0All the characters. Yes, I thought they were all delightful. The different boarders Shannon lives with are all unique and really bring the story to life.\u00a0The storyline.It meanders, it twists, it turns, it rests but it never stops. Reading this book was like walking along a path in a park. I didn't know quite were it was leading, but I always knew that it was leading somewhere. What I found was the path itself was more or less the destination, and when you come to the end of the book the story or path never really ends either. Instead its as if you can see it stretching out ahead of you. This was both satisfying and unsatisfying. I think on a whole it fit the book much better than if she had tied up all the loose ends completely, it fit the style of the story.\u00a0Cons:There is no solid ending. I know I said I liked this. Well, I liked that it fit in with the theme. I did not like that I never got to see a specific scene that resolved everything at the end. It was left with a sort of unfinished feeling on purpose. I understand the benefits of this, but I still can't help feeling a little frustrated and disappointed to not be left with a more satisfying conclusion.-Last Words-I said it earlier.

Originally published in 1968, it's the story of an eighteen year old girl completely at loose ends--she's the child of divorced celebrity parents who have raised her all over Europe, and she has no idea who she is, where she belongs, or what she wants to do with her life. So when a family friend enlists her help in determining if an elderly woman's will--with a number of odd bequests--was tricked out of her, she's happy to go undercover as a beehived waitress in Portland, Oregon, and get to know the locals.

I appreciated that she'd thought out her whole book well enough not to drop small nuances. My favorite of these was a few references to the bandicoot's \"expert dodging.\" The tension between Dave and Shan is contrived, but the situation they end up in serves a good role for the plot, so I'll forgive it (though I was not happy any time Dave showed up in the novel).

It's a great read for teens and 20-somethings (being most apropos to that age range), but honestly, it's still a really good read when past one's twenties. The title is extremely fitting; besides the name Greensleeves being applied to Shannon herself and the tune coming up frequently in the story, the book feels a bit like that Elizabethan tune--that beautiful blend of both major and minor chords that gives it such a wistful, not wholly-resolved feeling.A bit of romance, a bit of a mystery, and a lot of self-discovery."}, {"userName": "Kiora Nield", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31539953-kiora-nield", "userReview": "I loved the first 2/3\u2019s of this book.

I knew it had GREEN somehow in the title, and I've searched the library shelves in futility until finally, I've been reunited with the book: Greensleeves. When I finished it this time, it moved me differently, not to tears, maybe because when I read it as a kid I wanted a certain outcome that as an adult I didn't need. My favorite thing about this book was Shannon, a girl so relatable and real, who ironically doesn't want to be who she is, prompting her to assume a new identity. Yet we see her in her totality, all the things about her, and we love her: we love her REAL inner conflicts about things, her sense of humor, her need to disappear from a world she doesn't belong in, her way of bringing people out (Wynola, Mrs. Heater) and charming Sherry, her way of understanding people. Seeing her as real makes me want her to just BE herself, but it's true that we never see our best qualities, we are always in the dark about our own magnificence.That's why Sherry was necessary in the book. He was instantly beguiled by her, and we see this, even though she doesn't seem convinced of his interest. We need him in the story both for her to fall in love with, but also to make her disguise a sham, because he falls in love with HER, not with her disguise, evidenced in the fact that when she does away with it, nothing has changed on his part. Even though she's wearing a disguise, she's not disguised from her true self. She, like Mrs. D. (writer of the will) freed people from cages, just in getting to know them. She freed Mrs. Heater from loneliness, Wynola from sadness. She got lost like Mrs. D would've wanted her to do- it was essential to her, and I would like to think she eventually found her way back to Sherry, as the ending hints.Favorite moments:The Wynola haircutting incident \"Well, you've ruined her. She was pure Gothic. That fright wig was just right.\"-DaveIn a conversation with Wynola's mother about it:\"She's 100% better looking without it.\" (Shannon)\"None of your business to say whether she is or she isn't!\"(Mrs. Jackson)\"That's perfectly true,\" I told her coldly. \"I'm saying it anyway. Wynola loved it. It made her FEEL better. More-more hopeful.\"\"What's she got to hope for?\"Mrs. Jackson flung at me.\"Whatever she wants to hope for-same as anybody else!\" I flung right back........\"......it's my own doing. I started the rebellion; Wynola now assumes she can count on me to stick by her through the hostilities, and I can't blame her, but my word how I would love to withdraw my fingers from this very sticky pie. On the other hand, DRAT IT, here Wynola is showing signs of spunk at last, back on a slimming routine, and acting sort of generally alive. And every time I look at her hair-professionally trimmed yesterday and a big success-I ask myself if my sister Charmeen could have been wrong after all about my going into hairdressing as a career. Until the next time I see Mrs. J, who keeps right on making me feel like the only little skunk at the woodlands picnic. So I swing like a berserk pendulum between angry defensiveness and a sort of hunted guilt.\"When Dave slips a weed picture under Shannon's door When Shannon learns all about Mrs. D from Mrs. HeaterShannon's dinner date with Sherry part 1) \"So we didn't talk about that, but I didn't care, so long as we went on talking and I could go on watching Sherry's smile come and go, and his long greenish eyes turn greener when he was especially interested, and feeling little things between us pulling.

I have read and loved some of these books, and failed to read others because of finding them too twee -- but this one starts after that plot has already occured, Mrs D. has died and left the will behind which is intended to fix everyone's problems, but as it turns out it doesn't work -- not just because the will is contested (which is necessary to set up the novel), but because the people she is trying to help have mixed feelings about being helped in that way. If the will had gone through they would have accepted it, but part of what the novel illustrates is how, really, they are either already capable of doing it for themselves (Wynola, Dave, Miss Heater, Sherry), or Mrs D.'s money wouldn't have actually changed anything (Mrs. Hockins, Mr. Bruce) because the problem is within the person. I found that an interesting grounded life lesson, that fairy tale fixing people's self-actualisation issues isn't really possible, and of course it ties into Shannon's own story, she (and Sherry) just need a ton of time and space and living to figure themselves out. And speaking of that, I found it really interesting how Shannon 'interfering' with Sherry was done so clearly in a way which puts it upon him rather than upon her -- he's the one who is trying to dump his entire life plan in order to marry her, and she's the one who can see what a really bad idea it is. The novel is open at the end -- they might still love each other, they might not, they might end up together, they might not, nobody can know until it happens and it hasn't happened yet. I guess this is because while there is a romance in the book, it is not a romance novel! Interesting to have a novel with a female protagonist from the period which is not a romance.

With a little history thrown in, it's probably my favorite genre (think Betsy-Tacy, Beany Malone, Up a Road Slowly, I Capture the Castle ... if you know of other books like this, please recommend them!). I can't remember when I last enjoyed a book so much. My kind of perfect summer read!The mystery aspect in this was very light, so if you're expecting a big reveal, you will be disappointed. But I liked how this aspect was handled. The strange situation slowly unraveled at the pace of life. Clues appeared startling from a distance, only to evaporate once Shannon got closer to the subjects, getting to know the people and events as they really were. Still, I enjoyed the slight mystery, as it keeps the story from getting too weighed down by Shannon's young adult angst. The conclusion was unsatisfactory to me, though. I like that not everything was tied up in a bow, but I just wanted something ... more. I also think Shannon's love of writing could have been built up and foreshadowed, instead of just being discovered in a sudden moment of revelation. I also disagree with the book's rather libertarian/radical individualistic message that \"people can't ever help each other\" and \"often with the best of intentions, people just get in each other's way\" (320). Sure, \"people have to open their own cages\" (317), in a sense. Shannon did have to figure things out for herself--we always do--but lots of people help along the way. Solidarity! There was also a postmodern, relativistic line that raised a red flag for me: Shannon apparently comes to believe that truth is ambiguous and unknowable.The exploration of the types of love was interesting, even if Shannon was understandably confused there for a while. (Because of some heavy kissing scenes, I wouldn't give this to young readers.) David was kind of a creepy, weird character, but I think she grew from knowing him. I really appreciate how the book gave a sensible analysis on boundaries, and how mere \"fireworks [have] no real value as a proof of love\" (308). Feelings can certainly be useful but, as she realizes, you need more than that to build a lifelong love. Surprisingly, this distinction about the types of love (e.g., love of use, love of the will, etc.) surfaces all too rarely in books/movies. She made the right choice about Sherry, I think, although it was a painful one! Both of them had some growing to do. I just wish there was a sequel or something else. I want more of the story, and I think there's still plenty left that could have been explored. This would have made a very fun series. This book isn't perfect, but I will treasure it for the setting, humor, and for perfectly capturing what it feels like to be on the cusp of adulthood.

So the title character establishes herself as a waitress in the little resetaurant that is the social center of the neighborhood, and even moves into the dead lady's room, to snoop around for her uncle. Over the course of the summer she befriends all of the recipients in the will, falls in love with one of them, has to fight her growing lust for another of them, and naturally learns a lot about herself.The book is well written and well paced. From my plot synopsis a reader may not think much of the plot. But when one considers that this book was published in 1968, I tend to think that author McGraw may have pushing the boundaries of what was considered acceptable behavior for an 18-year-old girl during that era's young adult literature.Also, since it was 1968, there are some cultural oddities that are kind of funny, since we would handle certain situations quite differently today. The lack of anything like an ATM machine presents a challenge at the begging of the story, and frequent references to Pan Am Airlines at the beginning are kind of odd, since a modern teen would never have heard of that carrier. In addition, the main character essentially feels the need to cut herself off completely from her uncle while she does his spying for him, even though he works only a few blocks away. E-mail, text messaging, and cell phones (which all of today's teens just can't do without) would certainly have alleviated that challenge.Personally, I think this would be a neat book that ought to be considered for re-publication, or possibly made into a movie...the polt essentials are pretty good, and the resolution of the story is fairly credible and relevant. I would be interested to see how today's 18 year olds would relate to this tale. I think they'd like it, although much would have to be updated if the story was to be set in today's world, and those changes might play havoc with some plot particulars.Overall, a pretty good book!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/799504-sarah", "userReview": "April 8, 2015This book is back in print again. My sister bought a copy and is reading it for the first time. It is also available on Kindle which is where I read it again. I couldn't help but be a little impatient with the total lack of money problems this girl had. She had an allowance, two paid jobs that apparently were enough to buy plane tickets and hotel rooms even though she was only flipping burgers to pay the rent. Those were the good old days I guess when you could arrive for an international flight 30 minutes before time and run up to the roof of the airport without being chased by soldiers and held indefinitely on terrorism charges. However, what makes this book absolutely superior to so much young adult fiction is the wonderful and insightful exploration of lust and love. Shannon is presented with two young, handsome, talented young men and she must make a choice. Shannon doesn't have sex, she takes her time kissing and getting to know people. The author shows that chemistry and fireworks are possible with just about anyone all other things being equal and that is not enough to build a relationship or future on. There are so many little gems of wisdom skillfully displayed and that is refreshing in today's glut of sensational and titillating literature. The last time I read this book was in 2005 on a trip to Mexico and I'd read it several times already. It was interesting to see how I felt about the characters after nearly six years of separation. I was much more impatient with the protagonist, Shannon, making a mountain out of a mole hill about her identity. She was so upset about such small solvable problems, but I guess that makes sense since she was only eighteen. I can't feel too sorry for someone whose tough choices are: pursue higher education in Europe or the States? Oh, dear what am I going to do! There's never any question of money and she always has the option of leaving. She's never trapped or stuck, money is no object.The only other thing I disliked was how no one ever called her Shannon, but Shan. How disgusting. I hate affected, ugly, useless nicknames, is it so hard to say Shannon and do perfect strangers really need to call you by a chummy abbreviation when you have a fine lovely name when all the syllables are included. Examples of ugly stupid nicknames: Rach, Mon, Pheebs. Sounds like STD's. Still, I enjoyed the book, it was just as enchanting as ever, I still wish I was Shannon Kathleen Lightly, red haired, striking, moves well, incredibly well-traveled and multi-lingual. Some fictional characters have all the luck. The fifth star is for sentimental reasons as I've been reading the book since I was in junior high."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6539467-ginger", "userReview": "First of all, I Love Love Love coming of age stories. Of course, there are the childhood favorites - Anne of Green Gables and Rebecca of Sunnybrooke Farms. But every once in while, I come across a new coming of age book. And sometimes these books just capture your imagination and draw you into the story such as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn or I Capture the Castle. Greensleeves is such a book. Shan pours off the page. I know her and sympathize with her and want to shake her in turn. Her neighbors are all vividly portrayed. As the last page ends, all I want to do is read more.A couple observations: I love that this is written in the 60s when rainbows were just rainbows, hair was done in big up dos and blue eyeshadow was the rage, and no one has electronic devices. I have listened to the song, Greensleeves, several times the past few days.

I wanted a light book I could read in one day, and this one seemed to fit the bill. I really enjoyed the book while she was a spy (although I still don't completely understand why she decided to pretend to be someone else when no one from the area even knew her), but I liked how she interacted with the residents and searched for answers to the \"mystery\" she was trying to solve. However, the last 1/4 of the book left me confused. I understand that this was a book about finding your true identity, but I just wasn't satisfied by the end of the book."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca", "userReview": "This is really a book about identity.

Identity is not something simple, and getting to know yourself isn't simple either.

McGraw's eloquent language and detailed characters are just sheer pleasure. Of course we want it all to turn out happily in the end, but McGraw very sweetly gives us a real world ending.

I remember I really liked it but couldn't remember the details why. Every Christmas season, when I hear the song \"Greensleeves,\" this book would pop up in my head. I've tried several times in the past to find it, but because it was written in the late 60's, no library or other source carried it. This past Christmas, I hunted again and found it on Kindle Unlimited!!! I grabbed it and began reading it right after the holiday. This coming of age book is well-written and captivating. Shan Lightly is having an identity crisis. She just graduated from high school (which was a horrible experience). She was having a hard time relating to her divorced parents: a famous English actress and a down-to-earth, American TV personality. She was raised all over the world yet feels uncomfortable in claiming exactly where she is from. Her best ally is an uncle (not by birth) who sends her to a college town in Oregon on a spying mission for a case his law firm has taken on. While Shan takes on a made-up persona for the job, she confronts her own inadequacies and growing pains in the meantime.When I first read the book, I hadn't gone through any of these young adult anxieties and so I had imagined that that is what growing up is all about. As an adult, having passed through all those heart-wrenching feelings, I could still relate to Shan's conflicts but knew what lay ahead and often became impatient with the drawn out struggles. Still, I enjoyed this young adult novel set in a time I grew up in.Fun Fact: Eloise Jarvis McGraw was the John Green of young adult writers in her time. She passed away in 2000."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70243487-abby", "userReview": "[- it engaged my curiosity - the main character was interesting- she had a cool nameThen the beginning/middle:- I was excited to see what would solve the mysteryThe middle:- there was no mystery- I figured out the whole thing using Shannon's thoughts before she even thought of it- the mystery was overThe middle to the end:- she couldn't decide between Sherry or Dave- kissed Dave and decided she didn't and never liked him- had conflicted feelings with Sherry - Me: \"Does she love him or not?!\"- didn't know what to do with her life, either college or a job- decided to run away from her conflict - which was Sherry- finally stopped ignoring Sherry after about 2 years of college by sending him her address (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1209740-lori", "userReview": "I loved this smart, discerning story about Shannon Kathleen Lightly.

I read this because I was bored and I had loved Eloise Jarvis McGraw's book Mara, Daughter of the Nile  when I read it (four times) in middle school.

The novel was pretty much what I expected - a coming-of-age story with a quirky heroine, humorous moments, and intriguing characters.
