I won this book on GoodReads First-Reads! I can hardly wait to start reading it. It looks like fun.* * *This was a delightful read about some very unfortunate life and death issues. For an ARC it was quite clean, easy to read. If there were mistakes I never noticed them. But dropping into another's life and thoughts helped me see things through another's eyes. That's is how I perceived this book. Jim Higley tells his story of present and past in such a seamless way that I feel a part of his life. I hope and rather assume that there are more chapters in a personal book than in the public book. I'm sure family and friends feel delighted at this edited version. Mr. Higley glossed over issues that might bring embarrassment to others in his life and by doing so kept the picture and lessons clear. Never admitting perfection, Jim made it strictly his story, without becoming preachy. For a first time author, this flows with character and love. He kept me interested the whole way. Now I wish to see a part two! :)Passing on to friends. Eventually, I may have to buy myself the Kindle version to read again. Thank you, Jim Higley for sharing your life with us."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4331075-kristin", "userReview": "I won this book in Goodreads First Reads.It was a really great and inspiring read and I'm so happy to have had the privilege of reading it. For an ARC is was really well done, easy to read, spelling and grammar were good and most of all it was difficult to put down. It's easy to forget how lucky we really are and how much our parents really know until it's too late. It was amazing to see life through another persons eyes as he battled with a life threatening disease and read as he battled it to the victorious end. All the while dropping stories of his life and his father and his children.It woke me up and made me realize the advice my parents have been giving me for years wasn't all useless paternal nagging and I got new insights from Mr. Higley to add to me lessons to learn and look forward to learning.I'm recommending this book to family and friends, it's definitely a must read."}, {"userName": "Miri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4430576-miri", "userReview": "This book has a lot of really great messages. It is, however, super dramatically written, and that always makes me a little cynical. Jim Higley uses dramatic writing techniques--like parenthetical dashes--too often, and in places where they don't really make sense grammatically. He indents--the way writers do for emphasis--far, far too often.For sentences that aren't actually emphatic. Like this one.That is my primary complaint. As far as the story goes, it's nothing earth-shattering, but it is a lovely narrative about a man coming through a terrible experience, and it included a lot of passages that made me feel how special life is. Since it's so short, I don't mind recommending it (especially since most aren't as easily annoyed as I am by silly style things). The message is beautiful, and I enjoyed reading it.I won this copy through Goodreads First Reads."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2846752-amanda", "userReview": "This is a truly inspiring story of man that has been diagnosed with cancer and then after surgery on a summer of recovering he is hit by many memories from his childhood.

I would also like to say I have had to many of my family members die from cancer and my dad died by a drunk driver, all before I graduated high school so this story really hit home on a lot of different levels for me.

In his forties, the author was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had to take stock of his life, the legacy he was given by his family, and the legacy he would leave to his children. He described himself as a bobblehead in the introduction, a plastic figure who always had a constant smile no matter what influences or stimuli were thrown at him and simply bobbled throughout his day, but that it was still a plastic smile and he wasn't really living. Hence the title of the book.The lessons are short and seem to be pretty much common sense, although the author acknowledges this near the end of the book. He explains that while most people know these lessons and they may seem easy, they also seem to be difficult to actually put into practice. It would have been better if the author had acknowledged this near the beginning of the book rather than at the end, because it leads to a bit of frustration and forehead slapping.The author's story is told in a nonlinear style. Each chapter/lesson is divided into two parts. The first is a personal memory, usually of growing up in a house where he was the youngest of five boys. At the age of fourteen, he lost his mother rather suddenly to brain cancer. Later, he lost his father, and then his brother, both to cancer. He shares personal memories of these particular parts of his life. The second part of each chapter involves how these parts influenced his feelings and reactions during the time he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, the time leading up to his surgery, and his recovery. Each chapter concludes with the lesson that he took away these experiences.There are some distinct problems with Bobblehead Dad, the first being the title. Higley describes what he means by being a bobblehead in the introduction. This is where the problem starts, however. Through the rest of the book, I just don't get it. It didn't make sense as to why or how being a bobblehead related to these lessons. It seems like he forgot what the original motif was shortly after starting it. So, why he chose the title and went to the trouble of describing what he meant in the introduction seemed confusing and ultimately disappointing, like getting literary blue balls.I can tell what Higley is going for with his nonlinear storytelling in the memoir. It creates an interesting feel, and he's clearly going for the effect of pulling different pieces of his life together like a jigsaw puzzle to use as teachable moments and ultimate lesson that he has at the end of the book. The only problem is that it...just...doesn't...quite...work, at least not for this reviewer. Let me be clear that there's a certain charm to the approach. There definitely is. At the same time, though, it can be frustrating or, at worst, confusing as the reader tries to piece together this life from different non-contiguous and nonlinear parts. It's a style that I found interesting, but it also feels like it needed more time to cook.Ultimately, Bobblehead Dad was not without it's interesting moments or style, and I can't fault Higley for trying something a little new and in a style that's not seen often. It's part memoir and part self-help book. At the same time, it's not without some major problems and at times falls flat, and while the style of the book is interesting, it felt like the style was also experimental needed more time time and editing. My heart goes out to the author and his family for the struggles they've gone through in fighting his cancer and the losses they've suffered. But this book feels like it comes up short in telling of this struggle, which makes it difficult to fully recommend.Bobblehead Dad earns 2.5 out of 5 stars, although since we can't give half-stars on this system, it gets the benefit of the doubt and gets three stars.Note: A free Advanced Reader's Copy of this book was sent to this reviewer through a Goodreads First Read giveaway. This did not affect this review in any way."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913149-sandy", "userReview": "\u201cWords can heal. They can surprise. They can encourage. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are handwritten or if a Hallmark had to be leaned on for a little help. Words matter. Because they remind each of us who we are to the people in our lives.\u201d Aren\u2019t these just wonderful words to reflect upon on? These words are just a few of the wonderful statements that Jim enlightens his readers with as we traveled back in time with Jim, when he was a child growing up with his brothers and his parents and also as he shares his battle with cancer and the emotions in both of these arenas. How he connected these situations in each chapter was unique and sometimes confusing to me but nevertheless, I enjoyed the book and it made me appreciate again how wonderful life is and to enjoy it, as it truly is a gift and should be enjoyed. I have read books like this before, the books that give you a prep talk and the author gives you a reflection of their life story but Jim does that with an interesting twist. Each chapter reflects on his childhood, some story of growing up with 4 older brothers and then Jim ends the chapter talking about his battle with cancer and how he deals with it- either with his family or with his siblings. He tries to connect the stories \u2013not a sad book but more of a \u201cget-out-there-and-live-life-to-the-fullest\u201d book.

This book was about a 44 year old man battling prostrate cancer, but the emotions brought up with a cancer diagnosis are universal.The life lessons learned in this book are nothing we all haven't heard before. Enjoy life to its fullest, cherish every day you have, value family and friends over possessions. We all know we should be doing this, but sometimes it takes something as serious as cancer to remind us.Each chapter in the book followed a similar format. First an episode from his childhood, then an episode from his adult life. The childhood flashbacks would loosely illustrate a lesson to be learned. At first the constant switching from past to present was distracting. It was hard to get into the narrative flow. But by the end of the book I was comfortable with the time jumps. I did wish that more time was spent on the actual cancer diagnosis and treatment. I would have enjoyed more details. But overall, this was a good book, and I always admire people who have the dedication to tell their own story to others."}, {"userName": "Meagan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3880059-meagan", "userReview": "I am very impressed by this book. While Higley's perspective on cancer is not incredibly unique, his perspective on life and the connections between events in our lives provides valuable lessons for readers. I believe that the subtitle of the book, the style of writing, and the layout of the book perfectly parallel the author's intentions, and I appreciate the way that Higley challenges readers without being overly conversational.Some of the lessons are not unique, but some are articulated in a way that will force readers to consider their own backgrounds, and all of the lessons are well-supported with thoughtful, funny, and thought-provoking anecdotes.I admire the discipline with which Higley must have examined his own life to find parallels and connections, and I appreciate how well he articulated his observations."}, {"userName": "Kitty Austin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5208422-kitty-austin", "userReview": "JIM HIGLEY'S \"BOBBLEHEAD DAD\" (REVIEW)I am in love with Jim Higley and his family.

Being a teenage female i didnt relate to this book very well. The author is funny and gives lessons that i believe are great lessons for an older audience.

It sounds strange to say one \"enjoyed\" a cancer/inspirational memoir, but the stories, or \"Life Lessons\" included in this are poignant, funny and wise, some of them all at the same time.
