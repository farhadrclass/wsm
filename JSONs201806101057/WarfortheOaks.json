In fact, not on my FAVORITE SHELVES list? I've read it about 4 times so GET ON MY SHELF!This book was written years before the trend of \"paranormal romance faerie crossing into urban environment\" became commonplace. If you want to see one of the books that probably helped start ALL this paranormal stuff, here it is. GREAT book for girls and boys alike. I have it in 3 different versions, one day I'll get it signed :)"}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811687-sandi", "userReview": "I didn't know what to expect when I ordered a copy of War for the Oaks for one of my GoodReads group. Right now, I have way too many books to read and not enough time to read them. I certainly didn't expect that I'd find a book that I had a hard time putting down and ended up finishing in two days. As I understand it, War for the Oaks is an early example of urban fantasy. What wonderful urban fantasy it was. I loved the adventure and romanticism, the music and the fairies (don't call them that). Popular music plays a central role in this book. I've read quite a few books that try to integrate rock & roll, but they usually end up being really, really cheesy and imbued with that \"isn't it cool to be a rock star\" tone. In this case, music and the rock scene is simply a part of Eddi's life and Ms. Bull handles it very well. A few things do make the story a bit dated, like some clothing descriptions and the constant references to how hot Prince is. (I never thought he was.) But, most of the story manages to avoid most things that would make it seem exceptionally dated.Now, it's really possible that this book doesn't deserve five stars. In fact it's quite likely it doesn't. But, I gave it the highest rating because I loved it and it was great escapism. One warning: this is chick lit. I can't see much here that would appeal to most guys. But, I'm a girl and I liked it."}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "Urban fantasy was my drug of choice in high school. Before Goodreads and phenomenal English teachers took their toll on my ignorant bliss, I was perfectly content to base my reading choices on cover designs and dust jacket flaps, the key to my satisfactions being that perfect blend of concrete grit and fantastical malevolence. My tastes will never return to that simplicity, but rather than using that as a reason for forgoing the genre entirely, I chose to feed a favorable looking work to my far more complex quotas. At best, I'd be pleasantly surprised. At worst, my critiquing skills would be left thoroughly honed. Either way, I was confident I'd enjoy myself, on the knee jerk gut level if nothing else.I was right about the enjoyment part. However much I complain about stock plots and character tropes and the all too common utilization of burgeoning romance to drive the narrative and stopping just before commitment and faithfulness and all that uglier relationship jazz kicks in (love is so unsexy when it lasts forever on), it wasn't too long ago that I flat out enjoyed such things with nary a quibble. Also, I am such a sucker for snark it's embarrassing, and this book reveled in it.What I didn't expect is to find a perfect example of feminism in all its imperfections. Here we have a female character slam dunking the Bechdel test, but pinning all the real worth and character development on the way men perceive her. She promotes understanding and nonviolence, but only when provoked by external circumstances in a very level-up Mary Sue manner (fits every situation once the situation reveals itself in a dramatic enough manner). Persons of color exist, but so does a great deal of casual racism, culminating in an endnote describing the author adapting the book for a movie and choosing to cut one of the persons of color in favor of expanding two white male character narratives (predictable culmination, anyone?). In short, female solidarity is actively developed (the book flat out talks about women's rights at one point), but there is no application of lessons learned in the development process to everyone else. Also, violence accepted as comeuppance for breaking up with a man. Ugh.As for everything else. The fantasy was handled well, but compared to Clarke's complete and utter revitalization of the mythos in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, there was nothing new to be found. Also worthy of mention is the fact that the '80's were before my time, so all accompanying references went over my head and had no favorable impact on my enjoyment. The Robert Jordan Syndrome, aka spending sizable paragraphs laying out character's outfits every few pages, a list description method that was applied to anything worthy of visualization to a frustratingly banal degree, didn't help either. I did laugh, though. That's always good."}, {"userName": "Mimi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490110-mimi", "userReview": "So this is the book that kicked off Urban Fantasy? It was OK, just OK. The narration is somewhat annoying, which makes the characters somewhat annoying, but the action sequences make up for that. I can't fault this book too much, though, since it's the first its kind and therefore, like most pioneering writing pieces, reads more like a lengthy writing exercise than a book. The story is about a young woman with great musical aspirations--she wants to start her own band\u2014who stumbles across a fae war and gets recruited. She does get to put a band together all the while helping her fae \"friends\" take back\u2014and this is where I can't stop laughing\u2014Minnehaha Falls for the fae court. It's one thing to read about other cities getting bombarded with and pillaged by otherworldly creatures, but it's another thing entirely to read about your own hometown as a battleground. Since I mostly read stories set in far off places (and imaginary worlds), it's a little unsettling\u2014in a good way\u2014to dive into a book that features Minneapolis... as a secondary character. I would have to say the experience is similar to a mild episode of meta-awareness; you know you're reading, but you can't believe you recognize every landmark (and street corner) in the book. Who woulda thunk Nicollet Mall is actually a bridge between our world and the fae's? Or that fae factions used to duke it out every night right across the street from where I used to live?Urban fantasy has come so far from its origins that reading this book is like examining a piece of relic recently unearthed from some lost burial ground. It's always interesting to read the book that started it all."}, {"userName": "The Flooze", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/355739-the-flooze", "userReview": "War for the Oaks has the distinction of helping mold the subgenre of urban fantasy. Since I\u2019ve already tackled many (many) UF titles, that particular context is lost on me. What can\u2019t be denied, however, is Emma Bull\u2019s talent. War for the Oaks is an excellent example of everything I\u2019ve come to love about the fusion of modernity and magic. The main character, Eddi McCandry, is a blend of all we hope for in a heroine. In the beginning she exhibits a bit of poor judgment and has a tendency to underestimate herself, but over the course of the book she grows and learns. We come to see her as a straight-shooter with an abundance of fierce determination, a woman who tries to fight for what\u2019s right and inspires those around her to do the same. She\u2019s a likeable character and a true friend, a person who believes in free will and accepting consequences. The characters surrounding her are each notable in their own ways, but none moreso than the Phouka. Assigned as her bodyguard, he\u2019s often mischief made real - but it\u2019s clear from the beginning that there\u2019s a lot more to him than clever quips and keen fighting skills. He\u2019s enigmatic and eccentric, but endearing; it\u2019s easy to share in Eddi\u2019s growing trust in him. Many of the powers of the Fae are not clearly defined; Bull picks and chooses which rules to share, so the plot can glide along without the burden of weighty details. She demonstrates respect towards her readers, trusting that we are intelligent enough to pick things up along the way. In light of all the clue-by-fours and info dumps I\u2019ve been subjected to lately, I\u2019m immensely grateful for her polished method of delivery. (I do wonder how this came across to the audience of 1987. Bull uses much of the Fae lore we now find commonplace: the Sidhe lords, the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, the Lady vs. the Queen of Air and Darkness, the talent of twisting the truth yet never lying. Today\u2019s UF readers are accustomed to these beings and the basic rules that govern them. Would this have seemed more ground-breaking, perhaps more confusing, to her initial readers?)Bull\u2019s writing style is pleasant. It\u2019s lyrical and fluid, but never flowery or overcomplicated. Her analogies are marvelous - almost undetectable as they cast the desired atmosphere over a scene. They evoke sensory experiences, drawing us fully into Eddi\u2019s perception and fostering a connection with the settings and characters. Bull understands that small details are often the most significant. She uses this knowledge to greatest effect when describing how two people fall in love: through moments of stillness and unconscious gestures, she recounts the many tiny thrills along the way. This leads to one of my favorite passages:\u201cEvery motion she made was slow, as if she\u2019d never before put her arms around a man, and didn\u2019t know for certain where everything fit. When at last they were pressed close, she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d know how to let go when the time came. They summarized the course of passion with kisses: a chaste, half-frightened brush of the lips metamorphosed into something fierce and fast-burning, which in its turn became a more patient, more intimate touch, full of inquiry and shared pleasure.\u201d It\u2019s romance that a person who\u2019s experienced love can relate to. It\u2019s the hesitancy and wonder that washes over us in that moment we decide, \u201cyes\u2026this is the one.\u201d To capture it in such a way makes it all the more sweet and realistic. This down-to-earth style is a defining aspect of the book\u2026which is why I have one complaint about the ending. While every proceeding scene - even those dealing with Fae illusion - is so straight-forward and comprehensible, the final battle lapses into the abstract. We understand what\u2019s happening in the larger scheme, but the particulars are lost amid the frenzy of magic. Having felt so connected to the action until this point, it came as an unpleasant shock to suddenly feel distant from events. I\u2019m not sure if this indicates a hasty wrap-up, or merely my own inability to relate to what Eddi experiences. I wasn\u2019t dissatisfied, but the scene didn\u2019t mesh perfectly with the rest of the story. That one criticism aside, War for the Oaks is a well-executed book. It\u2019s easy to see how its release in the late 80s would have encouraged acknowledgement of the urban fantasy subgenre. Reading it now, 24 years(!) after it was first published, it doesn\u2019t feel particularly dated (even some of the clothes are back in fashion again). Instead, it\u2019s as thrilling a stand-alone as any current title, with an effortless poetic slant and a fluidity that\u2019s missing from many of today\u2019s debuts. It\u2019s touted as an urban fantasy classic - it\u2019s more than deserving of the label."}, {"userName": "JM", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/687074-jm", "userReview": "Adult fey urban fantasy. Eddi, a singer/electric guitarist living in Minneapolis, finds herself chosen by the Seelie Court for a job nobody would be especially keen on: the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, whose queens are resident in Minneapolis for reasons that are never quite addressed, are declaring a war for the city. They need a mortal to make the stakes mortal ones.This is a classic of the genre. I read it immediately after Robin McKinley's Sunshine, which frustrated me to pieces, and my first reaction to this was: Oh thank god, yay. It has a lot of elements that are simply awesome. The Phouka is a really fantastic character, especially in his early scenes, and the descriptions of the fey folk themselves are lively and convincing and imaginative. Possibly the best thing about the book is the use of music, though. Eddi's band is central to the action and ultimately to the plot, and the most powerful scenes are the ones in which they're playing and Eddi's feeling the chords slide and wail around her. It's tricky to infuse a written work with a sense of music, the emotions and the sounds-as-images, so I have huge respect for the way Bull pulled it off.But ultimately this book wasn't as successful as I wanted it to be. The main reason is, again, the main character. Everybody around her believes that Eddi has something special, she's electric and charismatic and no wonder the fey folk chose her. But Bull never really managed to convey that electricity and charisma. Eddi drives a good bit of the plot, she's not a passive presence, but she's simply not very compelling as a protagonist. Except when she's playing, and even then it's more that she lets us inside the dynamic of the band.The other problem I had was with the stakes. I didn't really care about the outcome of the faerie war. The battle scenes didn't catch me up. At the end something happens to make this battle personal - one of the central characters is in danger. But ... I didn't care about that character either. They weren't introduced in an especially sympathetic way, and they were never developed enough to make up for it. What really drove the story wasn't the faery war, but the romance. The romance is resolved about two thirds of the way through, though, and after that ... well, I finished the book, and I enjoyed the descriptions and the little details of the world, but I wasn't invested much."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1219253-amanda", "userReview": "This book has been popping up on my Amazon recommendations list for probably a year now. That, combined with the fact that there's a quote on front in which Neil Gaiman states, \"Emma Bull is really good\" (which may seem scant praise, but is everything to a Gaiman fan), I finally decided to just go ahead and order it. After reading it, I concur with Mr. Gaiman--Emma Bull is really good. An urban fantasy set in the 1980's, Bull takes full advantage of the time period by showcasing the music and the lavish, ridiculously wonderful over-the-top 1980's clothing (really, other than perhaps the Glam Rock period of the 1970's, there's no other time period in which a story such as this would work to such effect). Eddi is a musician chosen by the fey to be the mortal who will bring death to the battlefield in the Seelie Court's battle against the Unseelie Court (who will bring darkness and gloom to the city should they triumph). Bull draws heavily on the folktales of Ireland and Scotland and her faeries are wonderful creatures--seldom completely good or evil, but always looking to bend events to their favor with no regard to the consequences brought upon others. My favorites include Hairy Meg (a brownie from Scotland who brought her thick brogue and cantankerous temper with her) and the hilariously mischievous phouka who serves as Eddi's bodyguard. You can practically see these faeries as they may have been imagined by Jim Henson or Brian Froud. Overall, my only criticism is that the ending seemed a little anticlimatic (it did seem a little too easy to defeat the Queen of Air and Darkness) and shifts in time periods weren't always made clear. Other than that, an excellent book."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl", "userReview": "Apparently a debut novel by the author. Apparently, too, an early (1987) entry in the Urban Fantasy genre.Brilliant in many ways. Creative. Exciting. Thought-provoking. Fun, and sometimes funny, With some romance, some heavy-duty magical battles, and lots and lots of music. And lots of Minneapolis.Eddi is a strong woman in many ways. She knows how to lead a band, to ride a motorcycle, to buck tradition, to kick ass, to date on her own terms. She's almost too good to be true but moments of vulnerability made this reader believe in her, and love her.Perfect, imo, for this new \"New Adult\" classification in that it's a bit like a YA book but more interesting than most of those.

Who would of thought?!?And yet, Emma Bull\u2019s absorbing novel provides eloquent testimony to the centrality of the City of Lakes to the Fey World.Undoubtedly there is some important event that transpired in the next decade, since by 2000 the Dresden Files are evidence that Chicago is the place to be. \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2022 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2022\u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2022I didn\u2019t realize for a while that this book was written so long ago. I was enjoying the retro nature of the bands mentioned and the clothing styles, but then suddenly realized a character had just ducked into a phone booth. How quaint! Oh: no cell phones, no computers, and despite this being a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band story, somehow the whole grunge movement never got mentioned? Finally, I looked at the publication date and realized why half the references were to punk and the other half to the new romantics. (But no Adam and the Ants. Quite surprising.) All the male faeries are described like they stepped out of a Prince music video, and the lead character apparently dresses like Stevie Nicks.In any event, \nWar for the Oaks\n is an excellent urban fantasy.Strongly recommended."}, {"userName": "Siria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria", "userReview": "This book is a very strong argument as to why frequent, extended descriptions of what the characters are wearing is a bad idea: not only is it unnecessary, a lot of the time, but it makes the book feel very dated. The fact that the descriptions are of what was fashionable in the late Eighties is even worse: people actually wore that? With shoulder-pads? Oh my. Similarly: ixnay on the awful rock lyrics.Anyway, I read War for the Oaks because I had heard so many people describe it as a classic of the genre. Liked the Phouka a lot, didn't mind Eddi overly much (she wasn't annoying, though her increasingly Mary Sue qualities made me roll my eyes just a bit as the book progressed), thought their eventual romance made things a bit too treacly. It was certainly enjoyable, and a quick read, but I don't think I'd call it a classic\u2014perhaps more of a pioneer? I've read things by, say, Gaiman, who have taken on the same themes and roughly the same settings, and haven't left me feeling frustrated by things left hinted at or never explored. (Why the hell have two European fairy courts taken up residence in Minneapolis, of all places? What happened to the native magic of the place?

One could only wish that the subsequent urban fantasy was as good.At first it felt tired and old hat to me, but gradually, Emma Bull's world and characters began to build and before you know it, I was enchanted.It's a tour de force of music, magic, honor, courage, and love. The Pouka is the most endearing and lovable character I've come across in a long time. Eddi's character gradually develops depth and the story takes off. The peripheral characters are delightful.

I am definitely not the target audience for this. I don't like UF, I don't like faeries, and...

Looking at it from that perspective, and from the very important perspective that this was written in the 80s, things finally started clicking for me. The second half was quite good.The interesting thing about this was that there wasn't one single actual plot twist that surprised me.

Good, but not great.I'm not in one of my miserly moods, I swear. The heroine, Eddi, has her own kind of magic that comes from her stage presence when she's playing with her band. Shouldn't she have been more, well, charismatic? I liked a lot all of the parts when they are putting together their new band. Those were really good (again!) life stuff. But what about Eddi? After a whole book I feel like I should have felt like I knew her. I didn't. All I really know about her is that she has a vague sense of morality and puts together nice outfits (if I were girlier this would have been more interesting to me. All I really thought about it was that they didn't seem dated). Guys and audiences alike fall in love with her. Why? Make me fall in love too, Bull. I'm not being a Bully! (hahahah. Stop it, Mar.)The only thing that dates this book in 1987 are the references to Prince. I would say it is dated on the relevance scale. Young me might have only cared that a bland and easy-to-impose-oneself-on heroine found love and her dream job, and that all was right with the world again. Now I've gotta think: is that all?Eddi is chosen by the fae to bring to their war a to-the-death ability. She's chosen because the phouka (it isn't a spoiler to name him as the love interest. I called that from the moment he appeared) feels she's got her own magic from her art. The sidhe have lorded their lordliness over the lesser fae, and he's tired of it. After the war with the unseelie is over he wants to ensure they'll have a seelie to preserve. He feels that Eddi is the figurehead for the job, that the majority would rally behind her as something new. (It was annoying any time that anyone compared their leaders to the supposedly better mortal leaders. Right. No one has ever had any permanently good ideas.)But this isn't about art, love and death, or valour and honour. Not really. It's a little too much about how awesome Eddi is. It is a shame that the story never really took off from under the spotlight on the stage.The War for the Oaks is the \"first urban fantasy\" novel, depending on who you ask. Some give credit to Charles deLint (Bull's book is MUCH better than DeLints magic and fae book, the Little Country. Talk about your the world is one girl's stage stories!). At least Bull's book makes it nearly to the end before I started getting impatient. This \"first\" business is (to me) like the debate of who wrote the first story with robots (some say it is The Wizard of Oz) or the first mystery (some say it is Wilkie Collins's snooze-fest, The Moonstone). I'm reading it now. I don't care if David Bowie borrowed or if anyone borrowed from The Pixies, etc. etc. All I care about is if it is awesome. This is good but not awesome.The Good Fairies of New York is awesome. (Not everyone agrees with this. I love it for the qualities that irritated others. It is punk rock! And rock 'n' roll. Fight to the death for love and freedom! I want messiness. If it matters it is.)I was bored with the book by the end and didn't care to read the script sample from Bull and her husband for a movie version of The War for the Oaks. What it really needs is a great star to play Eddi. The most interesting thing about her cannot be how she wears her clothes! Also, reading about music would be boring for those without the frame of reference. I did know about a lot of those '80s bands (not that I'm bragging. I know about '80s bands and not much else). Unfortunately, a lot of them were '80s bands I am now wondering why the hell I liked them. The Psychedelic Furs? Why, Mariel, why? Same goes for Love and Rockets (I loved the nod to the comics. Eddi wanted to name their band that after the comics. I wonder if they'd have given credit to the Hernandez bros, as the real band Love and Rockets did not).I imagine a movie version would be like Times Square or Bandits. Or maybe Nana. I could think of more. I'll stop now."}, {"userName": "Erika Gill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528479-erika-gill", "userReview": "I wish I understood the hype this book has commanded for over twenty years, but I can't. I also wish I'd heard of at least half of the songs mentioned (stuffed, more like) in it. Unfortunately, Emma Bull was under the impression that the more contemporary hip iconic culture she shoved down the throats of her readers, the better it would be. In doing this, and shamelessly using her own (poor) lyrics as filler, she managed to completely neglect her writing. I can't even recall how many times I had to exclaim \"REALLY?\" before I lost my voice to disgust and just started gagging. Probably right around the point where Carla, a completely flat character seemingly designed by a schizophrenic, says \"No one is cuter than Prince.\" Or maybe it was Eddi who said that. Whatever, the two were completely interchangeable, which is made worse by the fact that Eddi is THE MFING PROTAGONIST. Gahh!!! Whyyy????? So...painfully...bad.DO NOT get me started on the phouka's dialog. Or the extensive descriptions of his (and everyone's) clothes (WTF, even 80s doesn't explain that away) and his hair, which, from the repetitive and unimaginative description was obviously a Jheri curl.Don't get me wrong, I can totally see the influence this book had on fantasy, and am willing to accept that it is a pioneer of the urban fantasy sub-genre, but I can only praise subsequent writers for redeeming it from the awful depths War for the Oaks set it at.

She attracts the attention of the Seelie Court and her life is turned upside down.I absolutely loved this. If you know me, and maybe if you don't, you know that Charles de Lint is my favorite author. This is something very much in the same vein as de Lint's best work. I don't mean that it's a knockoff, it's just something that I enjoyed for a lot of the same reasons that I enjoy de Lint.These characters were awesome. They're people (or not) that I would love to know in real life. Eddi is a talented, creative musician with a true gift. She's not perfect, but she's big enough to apologize when it's necessary. She can take charge when that's necessary too. She gives her all for her friends and refuses to give up even when everyone else is telling her that what she wants to do is impossible. Her friend Carla is much the same way, except possibly even more loyal and more likely to give her friends a figurative kick in the pants when they need it. Willy, oh Willy. What a heart breaker. And that's all I'll say about him. But the star of the show is the Phouka. Can you say book crush? He's funny, sarcastic, dashing, romantic, a rebel, strong, tough, just enough of a bad boy, and he's learning more about what it means to be human. I adored him. I wasn't too sure about him at first, but he grows throughout the book, and we get to know him better, and I was a fan for life by about the halfway point. Love him.Even aside from the characters, the story was a page-turner. I was supposed to be training a new employee as I read this, and he just would not stop talking. (Okay, I was not slacking. The guy was in his final week of training and he didn't need it. We had absolutely nothing to do. I had listened to his same stories umpteen times already. I wanted to get on with this story.) I managed to be polite and listen to him, but the whole time I was sitting there wondering what was going to happen next, hoping that the trainee would need a bathroom break soon and I could read a little more about what was going on with Eddi, the Phouka, and the Seelie Court. That's probably terrible to admit, but there you go. Read it when you won't be interrupted. :-)So, this is a new favorite. If you like fantasy and great characters, pick this up.

How about characters you care for almost instantly, magic that somehow makes sense even when it doesn't, and don't forget- the magic of music.This is no cut and dry good vs. evil tale either, like all great urban fantasies it's a whole palette of shades of grey, although you do know who's side you come down on- it's not entirely ambivalent, like some of Caitlin R, Kiernan's work- but you definitely see the beauty in the darkness.And woven through it all is an honest to goodness amazing love story.So very highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125045-peter", "userReview": "In my mind, this novel is the forerunner to a variety of urban fantasy ventures that have been written since and gotten more attention (e.g. \"American Gods\").

Can't wait to join you in New York for college.\" After reading Tam Lin and other works by The Scribblies, and now War for the Oaks, I've got to say, \"No, no. Actually, I think Minnesota is where it's at.\"There are many shades of myself. One is a girl who likes to walk barefoot through the forest and climb up treehouses, who picks daisies and makes snow angels. Another is a girl who loves the mystery and thrill of a vibrant urban landscape, the citylight stars humming along asphalt and bright window displays. This girl likes to wear skinny jeans, cropped jackets and sunglasses too big for her face. Who really wants a vespa. Who likes going to a sweaty gig at Joe's just as much as the opera.I have been unconsciously suppressing this girl for the past year or so, and War for the Oaks brought her out of me again. I've begun to question the value of these reviews--I always end up giving the book an spur-of-the-moment rating and talking about myself. So yes. Not everyone will like this book, 'cause they might get lost in the language or a musician's lifestyle, or they might not connect with the urban aesthetic or the fashion of the 80s. (But come on, it's not like it's THAT odd--this book is older than I am, or maybe leather and fitted shirts are back in style?) But I did, I loved this book--I think books that emphasize 'magic in your own backyard', sometimes among the banality of everyday life, are the most epic of all. The characters really sang to me, pun entirely intended. I liked the whole band, but Willy utterly fascinated me. BEST THINGS OF ALL: no unexplainable/unquestioned romance (none of that fate/destiny stuff), Bull's handling of the Fae--they are NOT human and shouldn't be depicted as such, a kickass girl hero, WILLY, and did I mention the spark of the urban fantasy genre?

Right off the bat I could tell where Holly Black got her inspiration from for her Tithe series as it was glaringly obvious (even if I had only read the first few pages of that book). Let me tell you, after reading poor novels from this genre I didn't have high expectations for it. Well, this book completely blew the others out of the water and has definitely set the mark for others to meet. The world she created was refreshingly simple, but yet complex. Her prose is fantastic, lyrical with unique descriptions that didn't fall into the trap of being cliche or trite. I couldn't connect much with the singer in a band bit because I've never had that experience but I can totally appreciate people who do this. Not to mention, I rather liked the lyrics she made for this novel. The way she wrote the main character, Eddi's, passion for singing was marvelous and it made me feel caught up in a magical world. I absolutely loved how the romance in this book was slow and built up so it was natural for the characters to fall in love, not like this \"we meet\" and then \"OMG I LOVE YOU!!!\" crap in young adult urban fantasy I see now. The other supporting characters were clearly defined and not just filler to enhance the main character's story arcs. If there's something I could nitpick it's probably the fact that the pacing slowed down quite a bit before the final climax. I'm sure it was the \"calm before the storm\" type of deal but I dunno, I just couldn't get into that part. Also, I may be wrong and my memory could be shot to hell, but I thought Eddi was the one who dumped her ex-boyfriend and not the other way around? Anywho, the ending to this was fantastic. She manages to give her readers a thoroughly satisfying conclusion without making it overly sappy, sweet, or riddled with barf-worthy cliches."}, {"userName": "Snarktastic Sonja", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9922356-snarktastic-sonja", "userReview": "Sometimes, in order to enjoy a classic, you have to realize that it was not written today. To read this book and criticize it for jumping on the \"fae\" \"shifter\" bandwagon is not recognizing that it started then bandwagon - it did not join the train in progress. I have heard about this book for years. It was written before I became immersed in Urban Fantasy. I'm not completely sure how I missed it at the time it was written as it was also before my refusal to read Urban Fantasy. (yes, yes, we all go through stages . . . ) Hmm. May well be that I was still reading mysteries and by the time I got into fantasy, it was old. At any rate, I dunno. What I do know is that I have not read it since becoming a fan of UF because it was not in digital form. It is now. But, I still checked the paperback out of the library. So, go figure.At any rate - we jump right into the story as Eddi is playing a venue with her band and breaking up with its leader . . . which leads through a mad dash through Minneapolis. Aaaand, the fun begins.There is mystery and intrigue and romance and music and twists and turns. I read it slowly to savor the fun and the action and the characters, who are beautifully drawn and developed. The shifter here has not taken on the \"alpha\" aspect that has developed in recent years. He is just another part of the fae. The fae queens, however, have all the superciliousness that we have come to know and love/hate. My one disappointment in this book is all the musical references and lyrics presented. I didn't quite understand all the performance descriptions and I could not sing the lyrics to any song but one and this quite distracted me.

It's a novel of fairy (faeraiye? Doesn't it seem that the blacker the nail polish, the more vowels should go in that word?) warfare, with a rock-n-rollin' Minnesotan named Eddi as the mortal lynchpin for the good guys. Along the way, a pooka gets screwed, some awful 80s rock lyrics are suffered through while all the while no character really does anything that makes sense. Motivations and character development are really arbitrary, and exactly what the protagonist lends to her supernatural allies is completely uncertain. The fetishistic detailing of Eddi's outfits, and of her band's Awesome Gear! is tedious, and gives the whole project a pall of wish-fulfillment fantasy, which is totally fine, but doesn't really appeal to me.
