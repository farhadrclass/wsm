In my mind, any book that takes me 3 months and 20 different tries to read is not worth 3 (i-liked-it on Goodreads) stars, especially a book written by an author I already respect. And I am not kidding, for me the first half of Gone Girl was a PURE TORTURE to read.Amy Dunn disappears on the day of her 5th wedding anniversary. All gradually uncovered evidence suggests that her husband, Nick, is somehow involved. Did he kill her? Was she kidnapped? What happened to Amy? One thing is clear, Nick and Amy's marriage wasn't as perfect as everybody thought.The first part of the novel is all about the investigation into Amy's disappearance, slow unraveling of Nick's dirty secrets, reminiscing about the troubled history of Nick and Amy's marriage as told in Amy's hidden diary. I strained and strained my brain trying to understand why this chunk of Gone Girl had no appeal to me whatsoever. The only answer I have is this: I am really not into reading about rich white people's problems. You want to whine to me about your dwindling trust fund? Losing your cushy New York job? Moving south and \"only\" renting a mansion there? Being unhappy because you have too much free time on your hands and you are used to only work as a hobby? You want to make fun of your lowly, un-posh neighbors and their casseroles? Well, I am not interested. I'd rather read about someone not necessarily likable, but at least worthy of my empathy, not waste my time on self-centered, spoiled, pathetic people who don't know what real problems are. Granted, characters in Flynn's previous novels (Sharp Objects and Dark Places) are pretty pathetic and and at times revolting too, but I always felt some strange empathy towards them, not annoyance and boredom, like I felt reading about Amy and Nick's marriage woes.But then second part, with its wicked twist, changed everything. The story became much more exciting, dangerous and deranged. The main characters revealed sides to them that were quite shocking and VERY entertaining. I thought the Gillian Flynn I knew before finally unleashed her talent for writing utterly unlikable and crafty women. THEN I got invested in the story, THEN I cared.Was it too little too late though? I think it was. Something needed to be done to make Gone Girl a better read. Make it shorter? Cut out first part completely? I don't know. But because of my uneven experience with this novel I won't be able to recommend Gone Girl as readily as I did Flynn's earlier novels, even though I think this horror marriage story (it's not a true mystery, IMO) has some brilliantly written psycho goodness in it and an absolutely messed up ending that many loathed but I LOVED. I wish it didn't take so much time and patience to get to all of that..."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "AMY DUNNEI am Amy.

I did really like the structure, along with some of the zingers, and some of the saucier images, but that's about it.From the Kushner epigraph to the name checking of Noel Coward on page 68 to the use of Pygmalion as a verb 20 pages after that (a synonym for to tidy, apparently), Flynn signals that she aims to create that most perverse of marriages here: a literary beach read. Instead of the best of both worlds, Gone Girl is the worst of both worlds: as pretentious and unnecessarily meta and overwritten as the worst overhyped literary debut and with dialogue and characters as cartoonish and trite and exposition-anvil-filled as your average suspense hack job.The absolute most offensive thing about Gone Girl, however, is how in love with being \"dark\" it is. It thinks it is so deep, so much better than say, chick lit, because it is about LIFE and DEATH and love as a prison sentence not rings and proposals and love as the solution to everything. But in staging itself, very Amy-like, so carefully in opposition to the thing it hates, it of course does not rise above chick lit, it just becomes psycho chick lit. Which may be different, I'll give it that, but it is not better.This is not good. Do not read this."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2950067-shelley", "userReview": "This book is such a steaming pile of shit for so many reasons and hands down the worst book I have ever read. There is a huge cloud of smug over Gone Girl. This was such an unpleasant read that I started taking notes of all the ridiculous parts. It also didn't help matters that I figured out the ending before page 100.There are lots and lots of f-bombs and swearing which says a lot since I cuss like a sailor. For me to pick up on that means it's excessive and adds nothing to the story. Then there's the issue with our characters. The husband is Captain Douchebag and the wife is beyond batshit crazy. The story of a missing wife gets so ridiculous and over the top that the ending could only be equally as absurd.Things I absolutely loathed about the book:using The Giving Tree as a verbredneck stereotypes like catfish gigging with dry cat foodrepeated mentions of having the emotional bendsrepeated mentions of characters having a vaginal smellpage 67 where \"Nick got home just after four, a bulb of beer and cigarettes and fried-egg odor attached to him, a placenta of stink.\"the sister's name being Gothe book's smugness.Had I not borrowed the book, I would have stabbed the shit out of it with scissors.If you want to read a book about a miserable married couple, read Revolutionary Road.

The author portrayed the minds of sadistic, narcissistic sociopaths making it a very dark book. And for some reason, I actually didn't find anything that happened a surprise. That made the story boring which may also have been because I didn't like or care about either of the unrepentant, unenlightened, and self absorbed characters. I just couldn't relate. Even getting some background on their families didn't engender any sympathy in me for them.

For one thing, I think the second half is a big improvement on the first half and, though this is my least favourite book by Ms Flynn, I can see in some ways why other reviewers see this as her strongest work.Let me ask this question: is it possible to be objective when writing a book review? Can a book ever be objectively \"good\", even though some people might not enjoy it so much? To use quite an extreme example, I really struggled to read Proust's Swann's Way and can't say I enjoyed it - but that doesn't make it a bad book. Surely I cannot begin to claim that Proust is anything other than a literary genius? I wouldn't want to try. I don't think I need to tell you that Flynn is not quite Proust. But some of the same old ideas kept popping into my head while I was reading Gone Girl because I think this is the book that most showcases Flynn's talent for writing. And for exploring the dark depths of psychology. Sharp Objects and Dark Places are wild, gritty, nasty books that pull you in, engage you and poison your mind. You don't devour them, they devour you. I read both of Flynn's previous novels in a day or two. Unlike Gone Girl, which I tried to read about five times and gave up, then when I finally came back to it, I took a week to get through it. To put it in perspective, I read War and Peace in the same time it took me to read Flynn's latest work.But it's good, isn't it? How can I not praise a book that so cleverly pulls apart the minds of a husband and wife? In terms of writing, creativity, originality... this is her best work to date. In terms of enjoyment... I struggled a lot. Gone Girl is much slower than Flynn's first two novels, which is both a strength and a weakness. It allows for a slow, cleverly-painted picture to build up of this marriage and its many secrets, of Amy and Nick's state of mind. It is intense and brilliant. But I think it all comes down to the fact that I didn't care much about the background story of the couple's financial hardship. I think this is why I found the parts where they whine about how awful their life is - moving from a huge house in New York to a slightly smaller one in Missouri* - quite tedious. I am used to Ms Flynn giving me the dregs of society, the lowlifes and the majorly-troubled, giving me characters with genuine reasons to complain about life. Spoilt, rich people do not pull at my heartstrings. But, objectively, this is a really great book.*The trolls have started descending on this review because I got the house sizes mixed up - apparently the house in Missouri was bigger (how this makes a difference other than to further prove my point, I do not know). I'm very sorry if I have influenced you to read/not read this book with false house size information.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "***MORE MOVIE NEWS*** Gossipy sources say that Neil Patrick Harris will play Amy's creepy ex, Desi, and Tyler Perry will play Ben Affleck/Nick's scumbag lawyer.

My Review: I HATED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK FROM ITS SNARKTASTIC SMUG SNOTTY STRAIGHT PEOPLE TO ITS PLOT THAT MADE ME HOMICIDALLY FURIOUS.I wish only the worst commercial luck for it, its movie, its author, its publisher, its publicist, its director, its producer, its screenwriter, and its legion of woman and crypto-woman fans.Edited to add: See comment #3 below for a fuller examination of the sources of my discontent.*************************EXCERPT FROM AN ESSAY BY FLYNN at Powells.com\"With a mother who's the definition of toxic, and a thirteen-year-old half-sister with a finely honed bartering system for drugs, sex, control. In a small, disturbed town, in which two little girls are murdered. It's not a particularly flattering portrait of women, which is fine by me. Isn't it time to acknowledge the ugly side? I've grown quite weary of the spunky heroines, brave rape victims, soul-searching fashionistas that stock so many books. I particularly mourn the lack of female villains \u2014 good, potent female villains.\"This is NOT how I saw Flynn's horrible characters. I might be wrong in my assessment of the story.

So what if you discovered after five years of marriage that you'd only seen the mask, and never the real face of your spouse? Once those dark truths were revealed, could you stay married to that person? Knowledge is power, and never more so than in an intimate relationship.What if your spouse knew you so well that they could anticipate your behavior in any circumstance, and thereby manipulate you without your realizing it?Gillian Flynn takes the common marital concerns about money, in-laws, and parenthood, and turns them into toxic waste in the case of Nick and Amy Dunne. Amy is revealed through her diaries, and Nick narrates his experiences as he follows the clues in the anniversary treasure hunt laid out by his wife before she disappeared. Did Nick kill Amy? A lot of people think so, but her body hasn't been found. Is Amy still alive? What was lurking beneath the surface of their marriage? GONE GIRL is a thriller, but it's a slow burn. Flynn strings you along. She doles out just enough information to make you think you've figured things out before she hits you with another \"GOTCHA!\" revelation that changes everything. And she saves the biggest gotcha of all for the end, which is shocking in its subtlety. The way it ends puts the final seal on what a truly sick relationship Nick and Amy had.The path is twisted, disturbing, and sometimes horrifying. It's also irresistible.

Pretty clearly that's not how it ends. It doesn't END that way. Yet, when I tapped Shadow's screen to turn the page (Shadow's my Nook's name, FYI) - there were only acknowledgements. And then I thought about it... I gave it just a few minutes' thought, and I decided that I thought the ending was appropriate. Fucked up? Oh my, yes. But fitting too, in a way. We do dig our own graves, don't we? This book kind of reminded of Lemarchand's Box. Every time you try to figure it out, it draws you deeper in, and in the end, reveals the kind of depravity that seemingly knows no bounds. Ineffable. And I kind of loved it. I thought I had this book figured out so early. I even thought I was being clever, despite knowing, KNOWING, that I was being carefully, artfully led to these conclusions. I was creative though. I had it all figured out. All I was waiting for was the vindication when the book caught up with me. And then WHATTHEFUCK?! The twist. Oh my. I never, never saw it coming. Despite having accidentally seen the table of contents, which kind of give it away. But, then if you know me, you know that I don't want to know anything - so I put it out of my mind. And I'm glad that I did. The first line of the Chapter of the Twist floored me. I read it four times, and still felt sluggishly stupid. I couldn't wrap my mind around it. I had never read Gillian Flynn before, only knew that her stories were dark, thriller types. But in that one sentence, I wondered if all along I've been reading a haunting story and not even realizing it. In a way that was right, but it's just haunting in the wrong sense. Or the right one, depending on your point of view. This book kind of... resonated. It's easy to get caught up in it - or it was for me. I could see myself, my boyfriend, my friends and their significant others, pretty much ANY relationship, in this book. And that's disturbing. Everyone changes in a relationship. Everyone. I thought, early on, \"Oh, this is a story of how relationships go bad when expectations aren't met - when people change, and grow lax in their status quo relationship...\"And it was, in a way. If the When-Relationships-Go-Bad-O-Meter goes to 11. Why not just make 10 more intense? Because this one kind of situation requires it go to ELEVEN. The thriller aspect of this book was fantastic. It's not one of those non-stop rollercoaster thrill-ride books, where every page turn is another exciting development. This was like watching the water drain out of a tub, slowly, allowing you to see, little by little,what lies under the surface. And you realize that it's recognizable but stunted and deformed, horrifying, and clearly dead inside. But you can't quite stop looking. I loved every second of it. Learning about Nick and Amy's relationship, both how it was so right, and how it went so very wrong. The characters were real, disturbingly real. Every word was expertly placed to take the reader along on this journey, and it was brilliantly done. Loved it. The moral of this story: Make an effort.

It is a gripping story of the courtship and marriage of a narcissist and a sociopath. They appear to be experiencing the normal setbacks of life during our recent financial meltdown: job loss, relocation, mounting debt, family illness etc. etc. It is easy to identify with them individually, which makes it harder to know who to root for when the wife disappears on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary and the husband becomes the prime suspect. Neither seems to be telling the whole truth, yet they both remain engaging. Each one alternates as narrator, so not only does the point-of-view shift, but so does our allegiance.

Just a tiny movement, a gentle follicular nudge. \"Is this a puzzle box?\" you ask, wary. \"I keep seeing people playing with ones just like it on the train. There is a huge stack of them at Target. These aren't really my thing.\"\"I know, but this is a really tricky one,\" she says. \"I want to see if you can figure it out.\"Now it's a challenge. She has challenged you. Your ego is on the line. You open the box.And holy crap, how did she manage to fit all this in here? Because yeah, it is a pretty standard box on the outside, and even once you open in up and start messing with it, sliding the pieces around and trying to fit them into place. Oh, it's well done. Intricately carved, ornately detailed, with little embellishments that earn a wry smile, a chuckle, a grunt of admiration. But still. You can see the solution, just out of reach, but you suspect you'll have it soon.And suddenly, the last piece clicks home, and the box opens fully, revealing an wickedly clever design that you weren't even looking for. You went in overconfident, sure you had the solution clear in your mind, sure you were smarter than the box, smarter than its creator. But that's just what she wanted you to think.\"Nicely done,\" you say, trying to give it back to her. \"Really. Nicely done.\"\"Oh no,\" she says, shoving it back into your hands. \"You aren't done yet. The really tricky part is figuring out how to put it back together. You're going to like this part best of all.\"And you do. But you also can't help but notice Gillian Flynn is standing behind you the entire time. Peering over your shoulder. Making soft little satisfied sounds as she watches you muddle about with each step in the reconstruction. You can practically hear her smirking each time you make a little bit of progress. Good lord, she is all but poking you in the side as you finally fit the last few pieces into place and what lies before you on the table is, once again, a box. Only now you know what's inside, how all the tiny pieces have been sanded and molded and shaped just so, fitting together so perfectly. The box is, you have to admit, a damned impressive piece of engineering.\"You can keep that if you like,\" she says. Smug grin again.Probably, you are never going to open it again. You've already solved it. But you can think of about 10 people you want to give it to, to watch them try to puzzle it out too. To put them through the same brain-teasing torture.\"That's fine too,\" Gillian Flynn says. \"I didn't really design it to be solved more than once.\"\"Yeah, no,\" you agree. \"But again: really nice job.

I can't deal with lines like \"She blew more smoke toward me, a lazy game of cancer catch,\" or \"When I think of my wife, I always think of her head....It was what the Victorians would call a finely-shaped head.\" (Hey, Gillian, next time you write from a male point of view, try to remember that guys notice T&A and not the shape of a woman's head. GAHHHHHD!) Then there's the issue with the character named Margo, or Go for short. What a pain in the ass when sentences start with her name.

You have been warned.**Thea\u2019s Take:(There will be spoilers, but I\u2019ll give you warning when they kick in.)I started Gone Girl knowing only these things.Gone Girl is:A. One of the bestselling books of 2012, recipient of multiple awards from critics and readers alike, across genres and categories.B. Gillian Flynn\u2019s latest novel, with a rumored HUGE twist somewhere in its 500 pages.C. Supposedly contains a razor-wire plot, and is some kind of examination of perfection, marriage, and murder in small town, Missouri.I finished the book in less than 24 hours, compulsively turning page after page, needing to know what would happen next, who to trust, how it would all end. And, at the end, I can add one more thing to the list of things I know about this book:D. A brilliantly written and plotted mystery, a miasma of wretchedness and hate; a book that I devoured but deeply, utterly abhorred.I will try to do this as spoiler-free as possible. Gone Girl is the alternating point-of-view, semi-epistolary novel that tells two stories about Nick and Amy. In the first story, Amy met Nick in 2005 and falls in love with him. They get married. It is blissful. Amy is the Best Possible Wife, she\u2019s funny, and smart, and beautiful, and RICH. Things start to go sour, however, when Nick loses his job, and then Amy loses her job and her money, and they move to Nick\u2019s small hometown of Middle of Nowhere, MO, to take care of Nick\u2019s dying mother (cancer) and father (Alzheimer\u2019s). Amy is attentive. She is supportive. She still loves the idea of her husband, though she knows things are falling apart. Nick becomes abusive, hateful, hurtful. And then Amy disappears \u2013 just, gone without a trace. In this first story, Nick is Amy\u2019s foil and tells his version of events, after Amy\u2019s disappearance. In his narrative, Amy is brilliant and beautiful, but also controlling, resentful, and hateful. Their marriage is a sham. Amy\u2019s disappearance puts Nick in the crosshairs of the police as the killer \u2013 and as the days after Amy\u2019s disappearance pass, the evidence against Nick mounts.And then there\u2019s the second story \u2013 and therein lie spoilers. Because everything we think we know about Amy and Nick? It\u2019s wrong. Amy is not who we think she is, and Nick is\u2026well, ok Nick is still douchetastically pathetic. In this second story, we learn more about this toxic couple from hell, and the pit of spite and grief that is their marriage.Like the novel\u2019s dual plot, I\u2019m of two minds when it comes to Gone Girl.On the one side, I can appreciate Gillian Flynn\u2019s skill as a writer. She creates two (ok, three) characters that are completely distinct, and she alternates these points of view with incredible deftness and ease, building a complex narrative \u2013 a complex crime \u2013 that is deeply disturbing but brilliantly executed. The big \u201ctwist\u201d is perhaps not such a twist (you kind of expect it, or you at least know that something is going to happen, that you aren\u2019t playing with a full deck of cards), but it\u2019s done really, really well. The first part of the book makes you question what you know about these characters, their lives and their secrets. Everyone is unreliable, everything is questionable. This is all really fucking good.But then, there\u2019s the other side of Gone Girl: the badness, the utter RIDICULOUSNESS of certain developments, the hate that pervades the novel to its rotten-apple core. This, I did not like. I detested the characters, from the unparalleled pathetic misogynistic doucheparade that is Nick to the many different iterations of the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Amy. I hated the way the story develops in the second part of the book, and I especially hated the way that it ends. I hated the pointlessness of the story \u2013 why does it need to be told? What does it accomplish? What does it say about us, as people?And here come the **SPOILERS** because certain things need to be SAID:Nick. I can\u2019t really waste too much space on Nick, because he is wholly and utterly pathetic. He whines, he pretends, he is so full of incompetence and ennui and self-important horseshit. He lost his job because TEH INTERWEBS ARE EVIL. No, seriously, he\u2019s unemployed because *whines* people don\u2019t read REAL magazines anymore and the BLOGS are killing everything and these HACKS are destroying the printed word and he\u2019s a REAL JOURNALIST and goddammit he\u2019s someone IMPORTANT and why can\u2019t anyone else understand that? He\u2019s GORGEOUS and all the women want to jump on his disco stick, and Nick hates them all for it \u2013 women are just things to him. They are cunts, or psycho bitches, or trying too hard (these are all Nick\u2019s words, of course). He wants to be a MAN and Amy \u2013 brilliant, beautiful, spoiled, vindictive, Amy \u2013 has stolen that from him. And then, that psycho bitch Amy fucks with Nick\u2019s life, and Nick has to figure out how to prove his innocence because all of a sudden NICK IS THE GOOD GUY.Which brings me to Amy. It turns out that Amy is not the eager to please doormat that she presents herself as in the first part of the book. No, she is an honest to goodness sociopath that has elaborately planned and framed her cheating pathetic loser of a husband for her death. It\u2019s not the first time, either! She\u2019s ruined female friends, and men that have DARED to cross her/make her unhappy (by claiming RAPE, or that people are obsessed with her, and so on and so forth). Amy is brilliant and vindictive, cruel and efficient in her mastermind scheme to bring Nick DOWN. As sick as it is, I actually liked the first twist: Amy\u2019s edge, revealed in the second part of the book, when we find out Amy is alive and that everything she\u2019s written in the first part of the book is a lie. But then, everything starts to unravel and Amy is made out to be not only a people-hating manipulating sociopath, but a completely incompetent one, to boot \u2013 she is suckered into a relationship with her neighbors while she\u2019s in hiding and is robbed for all her money (she only lasts for 9 days before she\u2019s robbed! COME ON!). She BELIEVES Nick when he goes on TV and earnestly pleads for his wife to come home, so she does it just like that. Are you fucking kidding me? THESE are the actions of the same methodical, patient mind that came up with this elaborate revenge scheme against her husband? I repeat: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?She then fucks, and kills, and makes her way back into her husband\u2019s life. She then TRAPS her husband into silence and complacence with a Miracle Baby (it\u2019s a BOY of course!) and that makes Nick stay with her forever and always.And that is the end of Gone Girl.There are plenty of other problems, too, but Ana has covered them all, below. Frankly, I\u2019m exhausted, and I don\u2019t want to waste any more time or thought on this novel.I\u2019m done writing now.Ana\u2019s Take:(SPOILERS AHOY)Gone Girl is one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read, one that comes with an inordinate amount of hype and disguised as a \u201cclever\u201d, \u201cdark\u201d, twisterific thriller that supposedly deals with serious shit like \u201cwhen a marriage go bad\u201d.It follows the story of Nick and Amy\u2019s marriage. It opens on the day of their fifth anniversary, the day when Amy goes missing. Soon \u2013 as these things go \u2013 the investigators start to focus on the husband. But is Nick guilty? Did he really kill his wife? If not, what happened to Amy?It\u2019s divided in three parts and in part one, the narrative alternates between Nick\u2019s first person narrative as he deals with Amy\u2019s disappearance and Amy\u2019s journal. As the plot progresses, their story is slowly revealed to the reader:Amy is a WEALTHY, BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL, COOL New Yorker whose parents write the Amazing Amy children stories. Nick is a BRILLIANT, HANDSOME journalist writing about pop culture for a magazine. Until Nick lost his job (because the INTERNET IS EVIL), Amy lost hers, and they need to move to Nick\u2019s hometown in Missouri to take care of his sick mother. Their marriage was already shaky but it\u2019s in Missouri that things start to really fall part between them. This part of the story is basically about Privileged White People\u2019s Problems and both come across as entitled WANKERS \u2013 especially the aloof man-child Nick who, once his marriage starts to fall apart and money problems hit them, cheats on his wife with a much younger girl (his student). It would be a very familiar and trite story except for the fact that Amy\u2019s journal entries start to show a different side of Nick: one that is increasingly abusive and scary. All of a sudden and in spite of Nick\u2019s protestations, it is obvious that he is hiding something and he might after all, be guilty.Then comes part 2 and the twist: Amy knew that Nick had been cheating on her and for the past year she created this elaborate plan to disappear and frame Nick for her \u201ckilling\u201d as vengeance. As such, her diaries entries are all faked concoctions. It becomes clear then that Amy is really, a psychopath. Parts two and three deal with Amy\u2019s attempted revenge, Nick\u2019s realisation of how far his wife really will go, all leading to the eventual showdown between them as Nick wants her back so he can clear his name and maybe kill her or something equally unpleasant.Gone Girl almost had me there for a while \u2013 I can vouch for how incredibly readable and engaging it is. I could not put it down and I had to find out what was going to happen to these people. I also thought that structurally speaking \u2013 with the alternating unreliable narratives \u2013 the novel was competent. It was also a success in the way that it portrayed its two deeply unpleasant, unlikeable main characters. The reader is supposed to despise these people, and loathe them I certainly did although it made for a fucking unpleasant reading experience. Plus, really, these types of \u201cdark\u201d characters BORE ME TO DEATH. But ok fine, this is a very personal reaction.The thing is: because the two narratives don\u2019t exactly fit together in part one, it is obvious that at least one of them is an unreliable narrator, possibly the two. And if a reader is used to reading epistolary novels, unreliable narrators and thrillers, it is easy to know that a twist is coming. Considering all this, is the main twist even that surprising?That said, this is not my main point of contention with the novel. The recurring themes are what give me pause for thought.It is possible to argue that the one of the main themes of Gone Girl is its thoughtful examination of marriage difficulties; or to question how well two people can really know each other or allow the other to know you and, unfair expectations. The problem is: the novel cannot possibly be indicative of all marriages or a heartfelt exploration of this theme because NOT EVERYBODY IS A VINDICTIVE PSYCHOPATH OR A WHINNY MAN-CHILD WITH SOCIOPATHIC TENDENCIES. Unless you know, you want argue that one can never know who one has married because maybe, just maybe your husband/wife is planning RIGHT NOW to fake-kill themselves and frame you because you didn\u2019t wash the dishes after dinner that one time. SO you know, BE CAREFUL. This means that the book only really works on its own microcosm of darkness.Another recurring theme throughout is the question of misogyny. Nick\u2019s father is a deeply misogynistic character and Nick hates his father and lives under the constant fear that he too, might be misogynistic. This is really interesting in the way that it explores the difficulty in getting away from one\u2019s upbringing. Amy on the other hand, is presented as a (kind of) feminist with her astute observations about social gender constructs by constantly calling on the bullshit of unfair social expectations around her gender. So on a cursory glance one could argue that the book is feminist. I\u2019d argue against that. WHOLEHEARTEDLY.What else could I argue when the only obvious feminist character turns out to be a psychopath who HATES EVERY OTHER WOMAN she knows, lies about having being raped, about being stalked and eventually \u201ctraps\u201d her husband by becoming pregnant. When the entire story is eventually contrived to show Amy as the True Villain and Nick as the one Nice Guy (despite his aloofness, his cheating, his lies and his manipulative strike) who is not REALLY a misogynist because he doesn\u2019t hate ALL FUCKING BITCHES, he only hates his PSYCHO BITCH wife (his choice of words, not mine, by the way). He is also the one who in the end, needs to contain the psycho bitch by staying with her and helping her bringing up their child. So then all of a sudden this passive-aggressive, liar, stunted, cheater is the HERO?HAHAHA: NO.And you could argue that these PEOPLE ARE HORRID and so of course, it all makes sense. But the NARRATIVE SUPPORTS ALL THIS SHITNESS by presenting every other woman in this novel as HORRIBLE PEOPLE TOO, without nuance. Well, apart from the two obviously good characters who are sympathetic TOWARD NICK: there is this one female cop who just \u201cknows\u201d he must be innocent and his own twin sister who is DUH OBVIOUSLY, so perfect and of course unlike any other woman. Plus, the one guy that Amy has accused of rape turns out to be innocent because really, he is just a Nice Guy and we all know that only ALPHA GUYS are rapists. Nice Guys are NEVER RAPISTS. EVER.HAHAHA: NO.Not to mention that the book COMPLETELY lacks internal logic. The one main thread of the book, the one point that is laboriously written through the first two parts is how Amy is incredibly smart and brilliant. She has to be, in order to manipulate, concoct and maintain all the plans she has over the course of her short life. But then get this, right? Nick concocts his own plan to make Amy change her mind and come back. And his plan consists of appearing live on TV and saying that he forgives her, that he understands who she really is and he loves her anyway. That\u2019s his plan. AND IT WORKS. Amy \u2013 psychopath, brilliant Amy \u2013 has a change of heart almost as immediately as she watches his interview. And that\u2019s because according to Nick, Amy lacks a \u201cbullshit detector\u201d. BUT the first half of the book was all about setting up and making sure we understood how much of a bullshit detector Amy actually had.So which one is it? Either she is a brilliant psychopath or a gullible idiot. SHE CAN NOT BE BOTH, BOOK.And I am going to nitpick too: Nick is in his early thirties buy he sounds fucking ancient. Like the whole whinny \u201cthe internet killed my career\u201d thing when he is at the right age to actually know how to take advantage of the Internet? Please.In summation: I devoured Gone Girl but I fucking hated it."}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "I've been completely fangirling over Gillian Flynn since her debut Sharp Objects six years ago. It remains one of my all-time-favorites, along with Flynn's sophomore novel Dark Places. No one writes the inner workings of warped and damaged human psychology better than this woman. With complete conviction I place her in the same category alongside the likes of Flannery O'Connor and Shirley Jackson. Flynn has a devilish, uncanny flair for creating memorable characters and twisty plots that drive down unexpected roads shrouded in fog the end of which you cannot see until you're smack upon it. So you can bet I've been anxiously awaiting this latest release with agonized, bated breath. Despite missing some of the texture and nuances of her first two books, this time out Flynn has offered up a bonafide page turner of the sordid, sensationalist kind that makes summer reading oh-so-sweet. Trust me when I say, if you're only going to take one book to the beach or cottage this summer, it's gotta be Gone Girl. I'm also going to encourage you to avoid all reviews (except this one, haha!) before you pick this up. Even more than her other novels, Gone Girl is so easy to spoil. Which is why I'm going to say very little about the actual inner workings of the story itself. And if I feel the need to get even close to doing that, be rest assured it will be put behind a spoiler tag.A list of lovables:Narrative voice: What makes Gone Girl such a compulsive read is the alternating points of view. Dueling voices in any novel can result in epic fail, especially when the voices are so similar as to be indistinguishable. If you're going to tell the story from different points of view, you better make sure the points of view are actually...different. I don't think I've ever seen alternating voices handled so effectively as they are here with husband Nick and wife Amy. As you read, you begin to wonder if either of these narrators are in the least reliable, if you're perhaps not getting full disclosure after all. I absolutely adored that pernicious doubt and shifting sympathies. It's like watching nature programs that can be shot to make you cheer for the wolf pack one week, and for the moose the week after. Is this manipulative? You bet it is! But trust me, being manipulated by a master like Flynn is sheer delight. Media as judge, jury and executioner: C'mon, we all know it don't we? Murder suspects of every sort and circumstance are tried first in the media and found guilty or innocent before the case ever makes it to trial. Before an arrest is even made, pundits, \"news\" anchors and bloggers put forth his or her theories and \"insights\" decrying yay or nay. You've seen Nancy Grace at work, haven't you? Flynn does a wonderful job here of dissecting our at times unhealthy, obsessive appetite for the sordid. How our voracious consumption of mass media provokes sympathy or outrage, how easily we are influenced to see a person as a saint or a devil. Innocent until proven guilty? Not so much these days. And good luck finding an impartial jury. Change of venue? With the meteoric rise of social media, you would have to go all the way to Mars in some instances in order to enlist \"untainted\" jurors. The only thing humans do with more abandon and conviction than fall in love is fall out of love: Love is grand, marriage can be a beautiful, wonderful thing...except when it isn't. The rise and fall of any relationship carries within it the potential to be staggering in scope and severity. What we once adored about one another, we now loathe. What we lingered over and savored to the last sub-atomic particle, we now want to obliterate from our awareness, pull an eternal sunshine of the spotless mind if you please. Oh yeah, I think we've all been there. More than anything, Flynn is putting gender relations and the perils of romance under a microscope, and her scrutiny doesn't miss a thing. It's tawdry, and titillating, and twisted, and didn't I already say the perfect effing read for this summer??? You bet. The only fly in the ointment here is that Flynn manages heaping amounts of sensational, but only moderate traces of substance. This novel's engine runs on the nitroglycerin of shocking twists and the suspension of disbelief. Flynn largely ignores the gritty demands of realism here as they will only act as sugar in the gasoline, binding and stalling a story that has taken flight like a jet-fueled rocket bound for stratospheric heights. When you are strapped on to that rocket, you won't be worrying about realism though. Or subtleties. You'll be banging on the table like Harry's Sally screaming - yes! yes! oh YES! Except in this case, you'll mean it.

I like dark and twisted stories. The twisted plotlines and authentically scarred characters pull me and I am hooked. Gillian Flynn wrote such a story line very well in Sharp Objects. That story is messed up but beautiful all the same. Donna Tartt and Tana French are other authors that know how to write about those dark places in the human soul. But it isn't just darkness in these stories that I love, there is also intensely developed characters and character driven plot lines but the presence of a very smart and impressive plot as well. Gone Girl was on my list of books to by for close to a year before it was released. There are very few authors who can do this genre well.Gone Girl in the end is a decent read. It is completely unpredictable, it is dark and the characters are twisted. The story is told from the alternating point of view of a wife and husband. The story pulls you in and you think that you know what is happening, you think you know the characters and then BAM. Seriously BAM. I don't want to write more about the surprises and plot twists because it will rob readers of the experience. I thought the twists were amazing and well done. Though admittedly, I was mad at the first major plot surprise. I had to put the book (okay my kindle) down and walk away from the story for a short period of time. But in the end I realized that Flynn was brilliant. She made me buy in completely to a certain idea of what the couple and the story was about.Issues of gender and economics are themes that Flynn touched on in Sharp Objects and she does that in Gone Girl as well. The main characters are without jobs, frustrated by the economy and have moved to a small dying midwest town. Concepts of what make a woman appealing and what is expected from a woman are consistently but subtly danced around in both Sharp Objects and Gone Girl. Family ties and relationships are unwound and what remains is not all that pretty.In the end, though, the characters were too far down the unlikable path for my taste. They were not redeemable. I like my characters flawed and hurting, thank you very much. But to have nobody in the story be someone I can attach to? To have only the side characters be the sympathetic ones? That is a challenge for me. There are certain scenes and phrases that one of the characters will say when he/she is mad (trying to be vague here ....) to describe other characters. I felt it was just too shocking, that Flynn's goal may have been to push the boundaries and make readers uncomfortable just because rather than contributing to the storyline. Now vulgar doesn't usually bother me and it really didn't bother me here, I just thought it was too much. So if you like dark, you like twisted and you enjoyed Flynn's other books then I suggest you read this. Flynn's works tend to be shorter than Tana French's and Donna Tartt's. They are definitely less involved and the characters, while rich in description, are not as complexly written. I'll leave you with an excerpt that will not spoil the story for you, but demonstrate that while this may not be Flynn's best work it is still good and she has an amazing ability to make brilliant observations about human beings in our modern world:\"Being the cool girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2 ... hot and understanding.

And I would have rated it thusly, had it maintained its momentum throughout. Sadly, it did not. The first two thirds of this book were brilliant. I\u2019m talking world class, fuck, I wish I could weave a plot so intricately, type of brilliance. But then I got to the \u201cbig reveal\u201d (cue gasps) and it soared too close to the sun. Its wings caught fire, and I spent the last third of the book plummeting to the ground, surrounded by its burning plumage, a helpless passenger strapped to its back. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let\u2019s start from the beginning, shall we? With the introduction of Nick Dunne, our \u201ctrusty\u201d main character. Ha. I never trusted that bastard. My unease began on page frigging one, when he said, \u201cLike a child, I picture opening her (his wife\u2019s) skull, unspooling her brain and sifting through it, trying to catch and pin down her thoughts.\u201dCue strobing red lights and blaring alarms. WARNING, WARNING, WARNING! THESE ARE NOT NORMAL THOUGHTS TO HAVE ABOUT YOUR SPOUSE. BRAIN SIFTING IS INDICATIVE OF HANNIBAL LECTER LEVELS OF PSYCHOSIS. ACCEPT NO FOOD FROM THIS MAN. ESPECIALLY IF IT\u2019S PINK AND SOMEWHAT SPONGEY. My suspicions only grew from there. His wife has gone missing, and gee, isn\u2019t he just so upset about it? No. No he isn\u2019t. His vague allusions about what took place during the morning of said disappearance, his nervous and unbalanced mind, the surrounding cast of characters noticing his \u201ctwitchy\u201d behavior; they only served to strengthen my belief throughout the first chapter that Nick had done something Bad. And then we have a sudden switch of perspectives thanks to the diary of Amy, his missing wife. From Nick\u2019s point of view, we know her as an aloof, haughty Manhattanite who thinks herself far above the muddy Mississippi riverbank town he\u2019s dragged her to, but in the first entry of her journal she comes across as a flighty, superficial nitwit. This is where that brilliance I lauded first became apparent. Nick portrays himself to be a harangued, belittled husband, completely emasculated by a bored, waspish wife. Amy portrays herself as a woman so sensitive to his feelings and the opinions of others that when he skips their anniversary to go out drinking with his buddies, she says nothing, so as not to appear to be that woman. In Amy\u2019s diary, Nick is the bad guy and she\u2019s the neglected, loving wife. In Nick\u2019s mind, she\u2019s the bad guy and he\u2019s the neglected, can't-do-anything-right husband. So which is she? Which is he? Flynn presents us with not one, but two unreliable narrators. One of them is lying about the other, and oh boy, do you want to think it\u2019s Nick. Because Nick, bless his chauvinistic soul, is a liar. He lies about little, unimportant things. He lies to the cops about details that are relevant to their investigation, ones that will only make him look guilty when the truth comes out. Why does he do this? Cue the voice of the collective: BECAUSE HE KILLED HER. HE DID IT. HE CALLS WOMEN BITCHES IN HIS HEAD. AMY SAID HE SHOVED HER. HE\u2019S A PHILANDERING, WIFE-ABUSING, MISOGYNISTIC PIG. KILL HIM!Nope, too obvious. So I turned to Amy, who, through her diary entries, and Nick\u2019s inner monologue, you begin to realize isn\u2019t some flighty nitwit, but a highly intelligent woman. I began to wonder if she was still alive. I theorized that she\u2019d staged her murder and had framed Nick to get back at him for cheating on her. When I got to the big reveal and discovered that my suspicions were correct, I was a bit let-down. I wanted it to be something else. I wanted some miniscule scrap of information that I\u2019d somehow overlooked to end up being the BIG CLUE as to what really happened. I wanted Nick\u2019s dad to be the murderer. I wanted Desi to have kidnapped her. I wanted Nick\u2019s mistress to be involved. I wanted anything but to be right. Le sigh. Even though I was disappointed by the plot twist, I have to say that I was really impressed with the portrayal of modern day \u201cwhodunits\u201d in the circus that is the media. Thanks to the internet and 24 hour news channels with waaaaay too much time on their hands, we all know that anyone with even an ounce of suspicion lingering about them in high profile cases such as this go to trial before they ever see the inside of a courtroom. They get to face public crucifixion first. As Nick learns first hand. He\u2019s portrayed as uncaring (because he\u2019s uncaring), he\u2019s portrayed as an adulterer (because he\u2019s an adulterer), he\u2019s portrayed as smarmy and unlikeable (because he\u2019s smarmy and unlikeable). And you, used to this three-ring fiasco, begin to think he\u2019s guilty. Hell, you want him to be guilty. You want Nick to be a murderer, because he\u2019s a \u201cbad guy\u201d. The truth is that someone can be all of the things you think Nick is and STILL NOT BE A MURDERER. Somehow, the collective has forgotten that, and I love Flynn for making us face that uncomfortable truth. This review is getting long, so instead of detailing all my grievances with the last third of the book, I\u2019ll just end with this: What. The. Fuck.

Twist after twist after twist. You think the plot is going one way, and then it spits venom in your face, gives you a heart attack, and just for the hell of it, turns itself into a three-headed monster just to save face. Whew! I know a lot of people gripe about the ending, but I thought it was 100% accurate of Nick and Amy's sick and desperate relationship. Flynn's writing is deliciously wicked. Her prose is dark and demented but also beautiful, honest, and hilarious at times. I was completely mesmerized by her writing style. What a talent! She's one of my top 5 authors of all-time. Flynn's other novels, \"Sharp Objects\" and \"Dark Places\" are also worth checking out. Both are brilliant and so fucked-up. Some books are epic and I'm thrilled to say \"Gone Girl\" is one of them. #TeamAmy"}, {"userName": "Tarryn Fisher", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6458017-tarryn-fisher", "userReview": "As always, I'm in awe of my idol.Gone Girl made me question every book I've read in the last year. Other people slap words on a page like they're writing a sloppy joe. Gillian spends two years crafting the literary equivalent of Beef Bourguignon. Brilliant. Flawless writing. Beautifully crafted sentences. Intricate characters. Plot twists that blow away all other plot twists. She's nuts. You can't write characters like that unless you are slightly demented yourself. But I'd join her cult any day. I want to drink blood laced cocktails with Gillian. I want her to comb my hair and plan my demise. FANGIRL!
