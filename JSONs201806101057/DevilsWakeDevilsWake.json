In this novel they create a world of horror so frightening as to be almost unbelievable. Set in contemporary United States, the novel begins as residents of Seattle become aware of a strange epidemic that is sweeping the city, and ultimately the country and the entire planet.As victims are bitten by other infected individuals, they in turn attack others in a \u201czombie-like\u201d manner. But they are more than zombies. They are the products of an alien life-form with designs on control of the earth through their horrifying plot that pits humans against each other in a life and death struggle. No one is safe. People unhesitatingly kill those they once loved in order to survive.The novel moves at a relentless pace that only increases as the horror the characters face builds, and they give up life as they have known it to only have a chance to live. The main characters, juvenile offenders spending time at a summer camp, must rely on their own initiative to survive, as well as learn to trust each other. They must cross what once was their country, evading human and non-human dangers, without losing their own sense of humanity.The book is an assault on all the senses, and emphasizes a fear that barely be imagined, when everything we depend on for safety, from our closest family members and friends to all our modern technology, is taken away.Do not read this book before you go to sleep at night, unless you have a very strong sense of reality. This story takes you to the edge and holds you there until the end."}, {"userName": "Christina (A Reader of Fictions)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions", "userReview": "This year, the office where I work brought in someone to give people flu shots, making it easier for people to get them.

Devil\u2019s Wake follows two teenagers, Kendra, a girl left adrift on her own, and Terry, one of a group of kids that make up the Red Meadows Five, serving their time as camp counselors instead of in the Washington juvenile justice system. After their bosses, Vern and his wife Molly are attacked, turning Vern into a zombie, the group decides to hit the road in a big navy blue school bus called Blue Beauty. Eventually, the little group crosses paths with Kendra, and she joins them, hoping to make it somewhere safe.Safety is relative in this new world of constant danger, death, and loss, and our group has quite a haul ahead of them. Terry eventually emerges as the de facto leader of the group, although the physically larger Piranha seems to give him a run for his money a few times. Kendra is drawn to Terry, and although she comes off as quite dependent at first, she eventually holds her own. The group has heard rumors about an island called Devil\u2019s Wake, that may be a safe haven, but they have to make it there first, and that means battling through groups of freaks (aka zombies), as well as human menaces. Constant vigilance is necessary, and I can\u2019t imagine being a teenager in this situation, without any help other than fellow teens. I appreciate that they made quite a few mistakes, but also proved quite self-sufficient and streetwise, and the group dynamic is relatively conflict free. There are no descents into Lord of the Flies territory here, and I enjoyed the cautious optimism of these teens thrust into an indescribably horrible situation. The zombies are a little different in Devil\u2019s Wake, though. Some zombies seem to retain shadows of their old selves, and can utter simple sentences, which ups the creep factor quite a bit. Also, Kendra has had dreams, even before the outbreak, that signaled something bad to come, so I\u2019m curious to see if that will be explored further. The author are old pros, and it shows in the writing. We never really get to know any character too in depth, although of course we get to know Terry and Kendra a little bit better than the rest. While there is plenty of zombie action, the gore is never over the top, so this book could appeal to older teens as well as zombie aficionados. While no new ground is broken here, it\u2019s an entertaining entry in the zombie pantheon, and the ending leaves things open for another book, strongly hinting at a burdgeoning romance between Terry and Kendra. I\u2019ll be interested to see where the authors take this group of teens, and plan on picking up book 2 when it comes out!"}, {"userName": "Bruce Baugh", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1729017-bruce-baugh", "userReview": "An outstanding work, in a genre that's hard to do anything fresh in. This is a zombie-ish apocalypse story, with the \"zombies\" infected by a mysterious fungus-like blight; there are hints laid for revelations and evolutions in later volumes. It's a nice framework that lets them tie together a bunch of different zombie tropes, as they cheerfully acknowledge in their thanks. What makes me rate this so highly, though, is the excellence with which Barnes and Due write about young people. They've got a talent for describing loving family life with all its complexities, bad mixed in with the good, human fallibility and uncertainty making hard moments harder, the ways it's much easier to make a sacrifice for another than accept a loved other making a sacrifice for you. The losses the protagonists suffer matter, because we get time to appreciate the people and ways of life they're giving up. There are plenty of exciting moments and some great horror, but it's all worth bothering with because of the humanity."}, {"userName": "Rashida", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237344-rashida", "userReview": "man this book burrowed under my skin. Creeped me out and drew me in. I couldn't believe how much I was enjoying it, how much I wanted to get back to it, how much I didn't want to put it down, and continued to think about it as I drove, ate, tried to go to sleep. I was really just expecting a ya (read light, inconsequential, romance driven) zombie novel. Well, it is a zombie novel. And it is about YAs. But I identified with each of these characters, worried about them, and was completely transported to the horrible world they lived in. The danger of these post-apocalyptic/dystopic novels is that I get too worked up by them because I start to obsess about how badly I am cut out for these scenarios. I would go down in the first wave of casualties, or else have great suffering among the survivors because I am ill equipped for a life of non-convenience. But there was enough hope mixed in with the bleakness that I could at least keep going through the novel, and even found myself wanting more when I got to the end."}, {"userName": "Brie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7839207-brie", "userReview": "The Devil's Wake is one of the better zombie stories I've read in a long time and a very underrated book. The story has good pacing and dives into the action pretty quickly and over all it didn't drag. The writing of both authors blends seemlessly, morphing into a singular voice even while being told from various points of view. I love the fact that the characters are of varied ethnicities and POC and none of them are \"token\" stereotypes. Nor are they relegated to being briefly mentioned and then shoved to the background. There were some scenes that didn't really make sense to me in the scope of the world and the story, but I was willing to overlook the minor stupid factor. On a personal note: Super annoyed with the constant references to pit bulls and perpetuating the negative image they've been assigned. You sound ignorant.

When working with another writer, sometimes you experience some rough patches as the voice and flow gets ironed out. That's why I rate this novel 4 stars versus 5 because the beginning of the book doesn't flow as well as the rest of it. By the end of the book, they are firing on all cylinders. I love their take on the genre and the way their Freaks operate. It's like a cross between world war Z and The Walking Dead with a very interesting added twist.

At the end of the book I was left unsure of what had really happened or what the author saw as the future.

It's when all of the loss, all of the traumatic events happen. Given the situation in the Bay and all over the country right now, with the fires, the ashfall, the hurricanes, the Nazis out in force, the government trying so openly to harm its citizens... the apocalyptic,'the world as you know it is gone' feel of the book hit really, really close to home.It was wonderful to discover that this book didn't follow the trend of all these other zombie books and movies out there which make it a point to kill off a member of the group seemingly every other day. Rather than using the post-apocalyptic environment to highlight the awfulness of the human condition, the authors chose to focus on the skills, values, and relationships that help the main characters get through it. It was extremely satisfying to read about them facing challenges together, because I trusted the narrative not to gamble unnecessarily with their pain and suffering. Their bonding and competence was beautiful.I was also struck by the natural beauty that was so palpable throughout the book. There was definitely a sense that humanity hasn't necessarily improved upon the world much, and the contrast between the loss/grief/horror and the fact that the snow, the trees, the ocean lapping at the beach could still have such peace and beauty was incredibly effective.Can't wait to read the sequel."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10308976-sue", "userReview": "Flu is the big news this winter around here.

Although, Kendra and her parents got away, unfortunately her father was a victim of this bite. With more reports coming through the radio that folks that are bitten first fall asleep and when they awaken they are zombie-like with red eyes and red tendrils hanging from their face. Before this could happen, Kendra\u2019s father ran off so as not to hurt his family.

Unbeknownst to me, I accidentally read DOMINO FALLS first so I knew how the story played out more. I still enjoyed reading this novel. Although this could have easily rated as a 5\u2013star read, I had to give it 4 stars because it still does not give a clear understanding exactly how this epidemic broke out. Everything is kind of speculative and rumored. Other than that, it was a story that had a lot of action and the reader is definitely drawn into the story and easily connects to the characters.

Although not strictly zombies, these people have fallen prey to an infection that first makes them sleepy and then turns them into biting monsters. They don't really eat their victims, at least most don't, but bite - trying to spread it as far as they can I suppose. The main two characters are Kendra, a teenager from a nice family in Portland, OR, who, when her father falls sick because of being bitten by one in the very early stages, has to endure his leaving home to save them, before his mind goes. Then she is given supplies and told to stay locked in the basement until a secret phrase that she has with her grandfather is revealed. She is not to come out for any reason, even if her mother asks her. Meanwhile her mother, not infected yet, but scared she might become so, calls her father and asks him to come down and get them. But in the meantime, while trying to help a neighbor, who looks fine, she is bitten by that neighbor. Finally Kendra's grandfather arrives and she goes to his cabin in the woods, well-stocked and prepared for living off the land, with a few trips to the local market, which is still open. And that is the start of her journey. The other is a young boy, a little on the juvenile delinquent side, from a broken home, who is sent to a camp for such kids, who still have a chance to turn around their lives. The camp in is the Southern WA woods, not that far from Kendra's grandfather. The couple that runs the place are nice, kind and have worked with troubled kids for many years, and soon the boys are whipped into shape and have learned some basic outdoors skills, including how to shoot a shotgun. The camp owns a van and a big lumbering old bus. When the camp's owners are bitten, they have to escape. One of them they lock in the fridge until he freezes - the other was killed by her husband. They gather up as many supplies as they can in the school bus, intending to head for the nearest town in southern Washington, and stay there - the radio, sporadic as it is, says there's safety and food and shelter there. They load the bus with as many provisions as they can, as much ammo and guns as they can find, and take off. And thus begins their journey to safety. Somewhere along the line, they and Kendra meet up and begin a long trek down the coast as it becomes less safe at each place they think is okay. Some of the people left unbitten are good, otehrs are profiteers, or bandits, or just desperate for food for their families. Eventually by the end of the book they are heading for Devil's Wake - an island where Kendra's aunt lives, and they hope will take them in (not giving away much since the name of the island is the title). It is the first in a at least two part book series I hope, since there is still much to tell. Good characters, Not too much on the attitude from bad teens excuse, and more about working together, with some trust issues. A few others are picked up along the way. Enjoyed it very much. Not great literature, but it's zombies!"}, {"userName": "Idris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4628056-idris", "userReview": "I always thought that I didn\u2019t like books about zombies or any other type of monsters that want to kill you or bite you. And maybe that\u2019s the reason why I have avoided those types of books, even though sometimes I have felt curious about them. Just once, I decided to read one, (Young Adult book) and the only thing I can recall is how disappointed I was. And then, I saw Devil\u2019s Wake and I wanted to read it. Just like an experiment. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to hate it or love it. The only reason why I decided to try it is because I liked the name, the cover and because it looked like an interesting and different read. And let me tell you\u2026 you can\u2019t imagine how happy I am right now\u2026 because I\u2019m totally in love with this book.Steven Barnes, Tananarive Due\u2026 where have you been all this time?Devil\u2019s Wake is about a world that is becoming something else. A world where people are turning into \u201cFreaks\u201d who want to kill and bite the rest of the humans. Kendra is a young girl who finds herself in a world where she can\u2019t trust anyone. All her family is gone, and she is headed to \u201cDevil\u2019s Wake\u201d, a place, where she might find some relatives and some security. In her dangerous journey, she will meet other kids that are in a similar situation.When I started reading this book, I must admit I didn\u2019t like it too much. The story starts in the same day when everything or almost everything is happening, and it was a little bit difficult for me to get used to what I was reading, and to be able to understand it clearly. But after a few pages, everything starts to get sense, and then I realized that I really liked the way it started, because there were no long introductions or boring passages, on the contrary, the book maintains the reader on the edge of their seats.The story is amazing, breathtaking, heartbreaking and incredibly realistic. I was able to see the changes with my own eyes, and I could understand the fear and the sadness people felt. The characters are amazing. All of them have their own stories and they are credible. Not all of them are good, or bad, they just behave like real people behave in that type of situation or similar. They not always make the right decisions and of course, you can feel their fears and how their dreams are mostly gone.Devil\u2019s Wake was a great surprise for me. I never thought I would like a book like this one, but I did. It was a marvelous read, very enjoyable, and the best of all, it wasn't as descriptive as I feared it would be. Like I said at the top of the review, this is my first time reading something like this, but I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last one. Now I\u2019m looking for something similar while I wait for the next book of the series.This book deserves five stars\u2026 and it\u2019s a favorite."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/887209-amanda", "userReview": "The writing is incredibly uneven, which I suppose can happen with two authors collaborating. The characters are pretty flat, and Kendra, Kendra was especially badly written. Even at the very beginning, before the zombie outbreak starts, I was absolutely sure she was pre-teen. Then her whole regressing into a child of 6/not speaking because of what happened to her parents just cemented that. Come to find out she's supposed to be 16. What?? The viewpoint shifts around a lot--it would focus on one character for quite a while, and then suddenly jump to another, like the authors realized they had forgotten about them; and then randomly new points of view would be introduced for just one chapter/section, and then we don't get their POV again. The ending, with surprise psychic powers and fields of \"rooted zombies\" covered in red fungus stuff was just absurd.Then there lots of stupid actions: like after Kendra's grandpa is bit, he orders her out of the truck and tells her to walk 20 miles to supposed safety. Why exactly would someone who's turning into a zombie get to keep the truck? Seems like sending her out on foot through the zombie-infested countryside is a sure way to get her bit as well. Then he tells Kendra not to go home. To a well-defended place that has an entire shed full of guns. Yes, they had realized zombies were intelligent and could track people at that point; but had grandpa actually given the truck to Kendra, she could have made it there to get the guns and gotten out before newly zombie grandpa comes to find her--or else could have made it there to make a stand against him. At another point, Kendra abandons her weapons and two forms of transportation to run away on foot from the zombies. Couple that with many periods of uselessness and inaction from her, and it's a wonder she survives.Finally, there's a big error in geography/continuity. When the characters are on Interstate 5 crossing the border from Oregon to California, in one chapter it says that they drive an hour after the border until they're out of the mountains, and then drive a second hour just to be sure they're out of a snowstorm. In the next chapter it says that they only go 40 miles across the border to Yreka, California and stop. Yreka is most definitely still in the mountains, so the second chapter contradicts the first. And secondly, once you cross the border, you don't even get out of the mountains until you're about 130 miles south. Even in perfect weather it takes 2-3 hours because of the winding roads; in a major snowstorm like described, it would take much much longer."}, {"userName": "Mary (BookHounds)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1378745-mary-bookhounds", "userReview": "MY THOUGHTSLOVED ITKendra is a normal teen, with two loving parents and then her world falls apart. Both of her parents are bitten by plague ravaged freaks and her grandfather rescues her and takes her off to his secluded cabin outside in Washington state. When her grandfather is also attacked by a neighbor, she meets up with some camp counselors who are also on the run from the freaks. Two twins, one extremely brilliant misfit nicknamed Piranha, Terry and another girl close to her age named Sonia. As they wind their way through what was once a normal world, they end up in a military base where they are joined by Ursalina. Each of these individual help make up a new family in order to survive the post apocalyptic world after the infection has brought the world down. The freaks are not ordinary zombies that you have read about before. They are not stupid and are fast at first, only slowing down as they infection takes a stronger hold on them. The only way they can be killed is by removing their head, either through a bullet or decapitation. As the story unfolds you get to find out the back story of most of the characters, especially Terry and Piranha. Ursalina, is slowly introduced towards the end. I found myself racing through this story to see if they would survive each Freak attack and then to make their way slowly in an old school bus to a place rumored to be Freak free called Devil's Wake, an island off the coast of California. Kendra and Terry do seem to have a connection but it is somewhat at that awkward stage. The real romance is between Piranha and Sonia and even that is kept under wraps. Each character must face the horror of their past to make way in this new world without civilization and now ruled by pirates or vigilantes who will take first, possibly kill and then maybe help you out. It is very fast paced and wonderfully written horror. Fans of The Forest of Hands and Teeth will find this world much less organized. I know this is an adult book but with most of the characters teens or young adults, it will probably be a great crossover for zombie fans looking for more adult fare. I think this is probably more tame than a lot of dystopian young adult books I have read. There is no graphic violence, only some minor kissing, and only a few mentions of alcohol.

That\u2019s okay on one level\u2014we probably need an \u201ceverygirl\u201d as one of the main characters in the midst of hell on earth\u2014but what\u2019s slightly less forgiving is the sort juvenile delinquents with whom she joins up. Some of them have bad attitudes, but not a one of the five struck me as being even mildly dangerous. I understand they\u2019re all petty criminals, or else they probably would\u2019ve been locked up rather than given the opportunity to help run a summer camp. And, true enough, there are distinct personalities and some clashes among the group, but I wanted more of a sense of true and mysterious menace from within. Not a gangbanger or a terrorist, just one person among the group who\u2019d make the others want to sleep with their eyes open. Then again, maybe my vision is clouded by reading too much adult noir; I may be asking for an additional layer of complexity where it\u2019s not really needed or wanted. Undoubtedly the authors just wanted to create a relatable cast of characters who\u2019d enough trouble to deal with in the freaks, the pirates, and Mother Nature. One of the most intriguing aspects of the novel is that the infection was spurred, at least in part, by the consumption of mushrooms that may be extraterrestrial in origin, and possibly even sentient. It\u2019s an idea only hinted at in this first book in the series, and by itself it may be enough for some to want to read on. But, towards the end, there are also hints about Kendra\u2014in future books, she may turn out to be not so \u201ctypical\u201d after all.Review submitted by Harambee Grey-SunRead unedited version at Diverse Pages."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Melissa's Eclectic Bookshelf", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6008941-melissa-melissa-s-eclectic-bookshelf", "userReview": "This was my first \"Zombie\" read and I am so happy to report that I really enjoyed it. Barnes and Due draw us in from page one as we experience an ordinary day that could be today turn into a horror story. Some unknown infection is spreading across the country turning loved ones, friends and neighbors into zombie-like versions of themselves who spread this infection by biting their victims. The characters, a group of juvenile \"delinquents,\" and a lone teen, come together to try to make sense of the new world that surrounds them and to find a way to band together and survive. I loved the interpersonal relationships among the teens, the way they each picked up tasks that benefited the group, and most importantly the way they trust and support each other through the ensuing chaos. Initially, I was a bit disappointed by the lack of descriptiveness but by a third of the way through the book I was hooked on the story and had come to appreciate the authors' writing style..It fits the tale. There are probably more questions left in my mind than answers upon finished Devil's Wake but that is not a complaint. I can't wait to pick up the second in this exciting new YA series so that I can find out what exactly is going on, whether those infected can be saved and if romance will bloom between Terry and Kendra.My only issue with this novel would be it's marketing. Apparently the blurb is for the series as a whole and not this book as an individual as there were no references to aliens or a struggle for the planet in this book. In book one we don't know the cause of these transformations and it is assumed that it is some interaction between mushrooms and a flu vaccine. I can only assume that such revelations are to come in Book 2 and I must admit that I'm a bit upset that the books own blurb would have such spoilers for the whole series."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10410760-nicole", "userReview": "Good first book!"}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4538194-alexandra", "userReview": ":/I spent all that time reading and that's how it ended? I hate that. I was contemplating so many times to put the book down and then I just decided to keep going because it wasn't THAT bad. I don't normally read zombie books. I read World War Z and thought it sucked hard, I started Warm Bodies and couldn't get into it..I just am not really interested in them. So why did I read this one? I guess I was more interested in what happened when the world as we knew it ended than the \"freaks,\" as they are called in this book. I liked the characters well enough; they were pretty flat but some of their back stories were truly heartbreaking so I felt for them a lot. Kendra's especially broke my heart. The thought of an apocalypse of ANY kind is pretty intriguing to me and the world as we know it ending. But what I didn't like was that things seemed a little too easy for the group of kids. Not that I wanted them to die or get majorly hurt or anything but it seemed like they always lucked out even though the odds were stacked against them. It's like things were happening to almost everyone else in the world but them. The whole book was just them traveling observing the remnants of the world around them but not being in any danger. Boring.Also, that bit with Kendra at the end. Um..what? Stoop. Devil's Wake was a huge disappointment and anyway why was it even called Devil's Wake? That should have been the title of book two. Which by the way I think goes without saying that I won't be reading"}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3569522-robert", "userReview": "This is a story of a band of survivors in a world gone bad. Folks have begun attacking one anther, biting each other and spreading an infection that continues to spread. This is not really a zombie novel, sort of just not really, if that qualifies. The strange part of the book is it being authored by two authors who are married to one another. That in itself is not the strange part. Most books I have read that have been written by more than one author have a single cohesive voice that drives the story set forth in the book. With Devil's Wake I could almost sense two threads running through the book. One voice seems to enjoy exploring the feelings and emotions of the group and the other strives to reach a more edgier tone with the book. Suffice it to say there is some action, of course there is with a worldwide infection going on, just realize most of it is more G rated edging towards the PG level. So those looking for something with lots of gore and action, something like The Walking Dead, this may not do it. Otherwise this is a nice little book for a mature younger reader. Also I hear a sequel is in the works."}, {"userName": "Deleva", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344712-deleva", "userReview": "I feel just... just horrible giving that few stars to this book. I am a huge fan of Steven Barnes; his book Lion's Blood and the follow up, Zulu Heart, are two of my favorite books. He's a magnificent writer. I've had less experienc with Tananarive Due's writing but what I've read has been good.I just felt that this was not up to their normal standards. It was by no means... bad. Just not as good as I think either could have done. I was hoping that the ending would lead me to feel more curious about where the story might go next but I'm sorry to say it didn't. The characters were decent but I didn't always feel as engaged with them as I think I was supposed to. It had moments but I just didn't feel that emotionally engaged. I would say that it's a worthwhile read, if you've never read anything by either author. But if you have, it's a disappointment and I fear that reading this will lead some to be disinclined towards reading their other stuff. Please do not rob yourselves of the pleasure of reading their other stuff! They are both so good and so worth your time. I just don't think this was their best work."}, {"userName": "Carlie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12016624-carlie", "userReview": "I set aside the weekend to read this book. The story itself is a solid three and half but since I finished it in a day, I go up to four. For me that is amazing and something I rarely do. This book held my interest and I only skimmed over a few pages. The downside to this book is that it is written with teens as the audience and therefore has a few quirks that are unbelievable. And yes, I suspend disbelief at the drop of a hat. First, our teens are 18 and they fight these \u201cfreaks\u201d and none of them get so much as a scratch. One guy drives all day long by himself day after day and its okay. They pass through skilled pirates with ease even killing some with expertise while they remain unharmed. They have a fight in chest high snow and no one is cold, frostbitten, sick, or anything. But the thing that bothered me the most was that I expected aliens from the description but didn't so much as read the word outer space except once in a passing phrase. That more than anything left me disappointed. The second installment is said to be released in February. I hope it gets to the heart of this story.

It gets pretty interestin. Ok, back to my review. Did I say how much this book scared the shit out of me? Oh, yeah I did. The scariest scene in the book for me was when Joe and Kendra were at Mike's place and when they were on their way out and he was askin, \"where were those boys?\" Man that gave me chills. I don't understand why they titled this book Devil's Wake bc in the book DW is a place, and Ima stop right there w/ that. Those of you who have read it know why I'm askin this question. I wanted more of the story. I don't so much need closure buuuttt I just need alil more. Mrs. Due and Mr. Barnes have a fan for life.
