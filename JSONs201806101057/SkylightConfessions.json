I found it trite and superficial. I hung in through the end, though, hoping it would redeem itself. It is the first book I have read by Alice Hoffman, and I don't feel inspired to pick up another, though I know I should probably consider it, as Hoffman comes up a lot on people's favorite author lists. From the beginning, I couldn't connect with Arlyn. Following the death of her father, she's devastated and on her own, and decides arbitrarily that she is going to fall in love with the first man who walks through the door. (Do women really do that?!) She seduces a man who appears on her doorstep hours later, he is \"lost\" -- they have a superficial affair, and yet she marries him and has two children with him -- no surprise that the marriage is a mess and a failure. Her son Sam has the potential to be interesting because he's an odd child who doesn't fit in -- but he just becomes a depressed, boring self-absorbed drug-addicted young man I don't care about. Arlyn dies of cancer following the birth of her daughter, and several years down the line in enters another lost character -- a young woman who is bright but disengaged with life because she hasn't fully dealt with a childhood tragedy -- who decides to become the nanny of Sam and his sister because she is intrigued by her visions of Arlyn's ghost haunting her husband.It's not that Hoffman's prose was lacking or I can't deal with serious, sober story lines or characters. But Skylight Confessions really fell flat. The magical elements seemed contrived, unable to revive the story. Fans of Alice Hoffman: recommend a book you think I'd have a better chance of liking, and I'll give her one more try."}, {"userName": "Deborah Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1377720-deborah-edwards", "userReview": "(Please note: my rating is actually three and a half stars)Anyone who mistakenly thinks reading an Alice Hoffman novel will be a light and enjoyable bit of fluff, has obviously never read one. Even at her most buoyant and optimistic, Ms. Hoffman writes books that will haunt you forever. And \"Skylight Confessions\" (a truly awful title for a book that deserved better) is not a buoyant and optimistic book by any stretch of the imagination. It is a sad book full of damaged people living lives full of secrets and regrets. It is, at its core, a book about loss. A book, in fact, about death. Hoffman is clear about this; the novel starts with a funeral and ends with one. We lose several characters along the way. But, like so much of Hoffman's \"Yankee fantabulism,\" it is also a book filled with the magic of the inexplicable. Make no mistake, none of this magical fairy dust is going to save any of our characters, but without the quality of the unknown, the twists of fate that define a life, the strange turn of events that can rewrite a history, there is no Alice Hoffman novel to be had. You might as well read the newspaper. But \"magic\" is not the stuff of Harry Potter in a Hoffman novel, it can merely be the \"spell\" someone feels he is under when he behaves in an uncharacteristic way, or how a character may feel bewitched by a moment in time. Why did my car take a wrong turn and end up in this place that led to a marriage? Why was I looking out the window just in time to see an event that would change my life forever? The inexplicable \"what if's?\" haunt our characters and also Hoffman's readers, because how much of what qualifies as \"magic\" in the lives of these characters also qualifies as magic in our own lives, how much of it is fate, and how much of it simple free will? Hoffman likes to play with the concept of destiny. She likes us to consider if our actions are guided by destiny or simply our own, if events can have a synchronous manipulation or if they are merely coincidences or things we will into being through our own creations. Like most of her novels, this one has a ghost. You need not believe in ghosts to accept the presence of this one, because it could all have a perfectly terrestrial explanation. Couldn't it? Several of our characters are the victims of lore, tied to the one story their deceased mother told of a race of people who could sprout wings and fly at the moment of imminent disaster. Our characters also happen to live in a glass house. No, not a metaphorical glass house. A real one. And it all seems perfectly natural, since it was designed by the father of one character, a famous architect known for his fusion of glass and metal. Here, the world of dark fairy tales meets the real world. Some children make it out of the woods and some do not. Some princesses make it out of the glass house and others remain captive there. But the evil stepmother is sometimes kind, the prince is rarely charming, and the character who finally sprouts wings cannot really fly. Life is an inconsistent jumble of people who have good and bad in each of them, who are the pawns of fate but cannot be saved by it, who live and die not having achieved their happily ever after. You know. Like life."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3430178-lesley", "userReview": "all I can say is I am on an Alice Hoffman readathon!!

The way she can form a sentence, twist it into something ethereal and beautiful, it always leaves me breathless. I always feel cleansed and well-read after a Hoffman novel, as though the books I finished leading up to her works were trivial and here is something of worth to spend my time on.Following four generations of the Moody family who live in the Glass Slipper in suburban Connecticut, Skylight Confessions begins with Arlyn Singer and John Moody as they meet under strange circumstances and form a bond that will affect their children and their grandchildren to come. Under the glass roof and clear walls of their house, secrets are kept and hidden. Mysterious occurrences are swept under the rug, and lives are forever changed by the decisions of others. Following the Moody children into their separate lives as they\u2019re drawn back to the Glass Slipper, Hoffman tells a truly character driven story, so intent are we upon Arlyn and John, and the residents of the glass house that we easily forget there\u2019s a world beyond them.Skylight Confessions contains the usual hint of magic that Hoffman is known for, but the writing is a little less sad than the previous works I\u2019ve read by her. Or maybe I\u2019m just accustomed to her tone now. The story of the Moody children is beautiful and touching, and in such a short book it\u2019s amazing that we come to know them as well as we do.Another remarkable Hoffman with all my favorite trademarks, empathetic with a hint of magical realism. All in all, a fabulous book and another great addition to my library.

And as she stands on the porch after the funeral, gazing outward, she vows that the next person walking by will be \"the one.\"Then a stranger stops by, asking for directions, and they are drawn together. Even when circumstances appear to step in and interrupt what has begun, Arlyn persists. She follows John Moody, the architecture student, to his university and waits. Then she goes to his family home, The Glass Slipper, meets his parents, and makes their destiny happen.Years later, they are living in The Glass Slipper with their unusual son Sam. And they are miserable. But they persist (or at least Arlyn does) in the belief that they are living out their destiny.Each individual's destiny unfolds, including that of Sam, the brilliant explosive artist. Then comes little sister Blanca, the bookish \"good\" girl. Her destiny is to keep Sam out of trouble.When a tragic twist of fate takes them all off the course they had envisioned for themselves, their lives seem to spin off, flying into some other self-destructive pathway.Watching the devastation as it shimmers and spins, like a legacy of broken pieces or a mysterious puzzle\u2014it is like watching some kind of train wreck.Much later, we see evidence of ghostlike visitors who leave behind broken glass, soot, and feathers.Hoffman weaves this family tale in and out through the generations, until finally we reach a kind of resolution.I was completely swept away by the plight of the characters\u2014almost obsessed.

I know the prose will be a lyrical, colorful, elegant and memorizing while tackling dark issues. I know I will be utterly consumed and unable to read just a bit here and there. I know I will come away pondering and appreciating the read for all it's beauty and ugliness. \"Skylight Confessions\" did NOT let me down. Based on the premise of do we destine our fate or is it predestined for us, this story starts with Arlyn and John Moody and a marriage that both forced into being. From this union a prodigy of unhappiness, discontentment and violence explodes. Indeed dark subject matter, it is beautifully projected in what may be or not be. Are their specters? If so then is there presence to revenge or guide? Is there true evil? Are the sins of the father visited upon the sons or are the sons excused by the sin? Is destiny fated or do our decisions determine our future? Are we responsible for our actions or are we forced to play them out to their appointed destiny? I read this book in an evening and into the wee hours as I could not put it down. Hoffman's lyrical prose tenderizes the rough grist of a story told with raw realism as well as magical. Her conjectures open the mind of the reader to introspection without imposing her own dogma. A magnificent read that exercises mentally as well as entertains with liquid prose."}, {"userName": "Dina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108227-dina", "userReview": "This novel starts as an interesting story of a troubled Connecticut family.

The house of cards falls down, and the book goes on the \"I give up\" list.Is it just me, or is the physicist apparently unemployed _because_ all of his research is on ghosts getting stuck in time.

She writes well, tells stories of whole and flawed characters, love gained, love lost, and pain. Sometimes triumph over said pain, but sometimes only time to heal the wounds, if at all. This book is no different, but somehow it fell flat for me.Arlyn has just suffered the loss of her father, her whole world, and a wayward traveler finds his way at her door. She, by way of decision or destiny, falls in love with this stranger and thus her life is set, as is the stranger. They are reserved and resolute to their circumstance of being with each other, for better or worse, aaaaand it mostly seems to be worse. Rather than find this story of generations and a fragmented family engaging, I spent most of the time just annoyed that people were clearly unhappy, but reluctant to put a name to it and try anything different.\u00a0I feel like Alice is still the same, though saying \"still\" seems funny as this book was written in 2008; somehow I missed it in my initial dive into her work.

I was wrong.The basis synopsis of the book from the back cover is three generations of a family haunted by love, although now that I think about it I really don't know which three generations those were - John's parents, John and Arlyn/Cynthia, Sam and Amy, or Will?

Like in fairy tales however, this whimsical tale hides ugly realities such as dsysfuctional families, drug use etc.Many methaphors hide in the pages such as the use of a glass house. Something about people who live in glass houses echos as you read it.At the same time you know that glass is transparent, you can see all the stuff that builds up. Glass like people is a fragile thing, you have to constantly give attention to its care or it becomes damaged, dirty and you can see all imperfections in it.My favorite part of the book is how it asks the question: is there one event that affects all other events that will happen from that moment on? The whole \"Path not taken\" question of existance. Arlyn's definition of the future, \"People often disappear right into it and all anyone could do was hope for the best\" is a thought that I have wished I could put words to for some time. If you take a wrong path then is it possible to shift too far off a path and you are somewhere that you can never get back from, can never find true happiness again?You can ask yourself countless questions while reading this book or you can just read it for its tale. Either way the characters stay with you far longer than the time it takes to read the words. This is, to me, the mark of a great book. People like Blanca in \"Skylight Confessions\" use books for more than just a passtime. Sometimes they become a \"buffer between the real and imagined world\".

Alice Hoffman writes like that. She conjures up the intense magical side of this world that many are too afraid to examine. They would rather look away. I can be like this, too. Nothing wrong with wanting pink champagne and bubbles, frills and without heartache. However, AH, her storytelling abilities delicately weave in a thin veil of hope at the very end of each novel.

It was a sad story, but you didn't mind it, because it was so well written."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237216-emily", "userReview": "Maybe I need to go on an Alice Hoffman diet, just like, not read her for a while, because I start to feel like. . .I don't know - the husbands will be bastards, the women will realize it at some point and something magical will happen. HOWEVER, that said, this one was pretty surprising. It did all of those things, sure - but the set up was different. And the magic was pretty ordinary. And then some very unpredictable stuff happened. I thought the book was going one place and then it took a crazy left turn, and then a crazy right, until I just had no idea what was going to happen next. That's kind of hard to do. So my hat's off to Ms. Hoffman, who of course, I love. This one just ain't at the top of the list somehow. All those crazy turns left me a little dizzy and also sad."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2262926-maria", "userReview": "I believe Alice Hoffman is officially my new favourite writer. There's something about the way she writes... the relationship she establishes with the words she uses... I think it's brilliant and it makes it so easy to feel the mood of the book, to get into it, to breathe through its characters!I love how this book is divided and how the parts work together. They complete each other so perfectly. It's beautiful. The story and the way it is told is incredible. Makes you think, makes you dream, makes you see everything so well... makes everything so touchable. These characters become your family during this book and you feel their pain in your bones. It's amazing to watch and walk with them, from the darkness to the light, and beyond. Memories.Absolutely in love."}, {"userName": "Bob Walenski", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12407639-bob-walenski", "userReview": "I read 4 books this week on vacation, 2 were amazng and 2 others slightly less so. This was the best of the best 2 and one of m,y favs ever.I've just been introduced to Alice Hoffman as a writer, what little I knew about her was wrong. I FOUND THIS AS A USED HARDBACK COPY, signed by the author in the sale rack at a New Hampshire bookstore. What Luck!!!!!The story is compelling, interesting, believable and poignant. The writing totally magnificent. Wonderful character development and a story that encompasses 3 generations of a family who have all the beauty, strength and weakness of all humans. Peotically woven like a tapestry, Hoffman takes you on ride that is so absorbing I couldn't put this down. OMG I loved this book!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/317383-rebecca", "userReview": "Hoffman's last few books haven't piqued my interest- I found myself reading them reluctantly. But this one proves she's back on her game again! The novel delves into the darker sides of families- it looks at addictions, death and affairs. All of these themes are tied together with Hoffman's famous mystical elements. The most heartbreaking character by far is Sam- a young man dealing with heroin addiction and obsessed with the stories his mother told him about a rare group of people from Conneticut that can fly. The jacket of the book promises \"you will never look at families the same way again\" and I'm somewhat inclined to agree. You will find elements of your own family in this book. It's wonderful."}, {"userName": "Omaira", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31468262-omaira", "userReview": "\"Aunque al principio no lo parezca, es una historia con una parte dram\u00e1tica muy importante que no dejar\u00e1 indiferente al lector.

This is one of the finest. It is a hauntingly moving story of a dysfunctional family unit at its best...and worst.Alice Hoffman is the master of character protrayal and writes with an in-depth, moving way about the threads that hold us together and then frustratingly become unraveled along the journey of life.This is not a happy, feel good book.

Yet the two are drawn powerfully together even when it is clear they are bound to bring each other grief. Their difficult marriage leads them and their children to a house made of glass in the Connecticut\u00a0countryside, to the avenues of\u00a0Manhattan, and to the blue waters of Long Island Sound.
