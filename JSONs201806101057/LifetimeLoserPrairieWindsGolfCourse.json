Schroeder (known as J Dub) is one shot away from getting the score he needs to become a member of the PGA Tour. He has played well throughout this qualifying tournament, and his confidence is peaking. His wife, Marcia, is standing nearby, pregnant with their first child. She questions the unstudied approach that J Dub is taking to such a crucial swing, while his suddenly swelling ego allows him to believe nothing can go wrong. Marcia\u2019s doubts prove warranted when J Dub fails to earn a spot to play his beloved golf game professionally. With all of the family\u2019s hopes and dreams riding on that ill-fated shot, what will be next for the Schroeders?So begins the first foray into the literary world for author James Ross. Over the next 300 pages of Lifetime Loser, Mr. Ross takes us through twenty-three years of J Dub\u2019s life and introduces us to a cast of unforgettable characters. J Dub and his wife are lured to Illinois by the villain of the novel, Lewferd \u201cLew\u201d Zerrmann. Lew asks J Dub to manage a golf course he just acquired, with promises of eventual ownership and a life-changing fortune. However, as the novel unfolds, we realize that failing to keep his word is the least of Mr. Zerrmann\u2019s unappealing qualities. Lew and his business associates introduce the well-intentioned J Dub to a world of murder, perversion, tax evasion and a demented fascination with a genocidal dictator. What could go wrong?One of the strongest parts of Lifetime Loser is the detailed attention to character development that Mr. Ross pays to each player in his story. We learn the background story for each person, from high school experiences to luck with women to professional successes and failures. The readers also receive vibrant physical descriptions \u2026 for better or for worse! I found myself rooting for J Dub and his family, while becoming more sickened by each new detail that was shared about Lew Zerrmann. The emotional investment that I staked in these characters was directly due to Mr. Ross\u2019 determination to make these people three-dimensional and complete in their personalities. I also was drawn to the layout that Mr. Ross uses to develop his storytelling. While the entire novel is written in the third person, the person, issue \u2026 and even year \u2026 of focus changes from chapter to chapter. We are let into the homes of the characters and even unexpectedly taken back in time to provide context for the plot. There are also lapses allowed in the chronology so that the reader is given the opportunity to fill in the details based on what we have learned about the people and their situations. Ross manages to elegantly fold these different snapshots together to create a novel rich in detail.Readers should not expect a quick and casual read that can be completed in one afternoon. The text of Lifetime Loser is dense and needs to be read carefully. I found several instances in which I flipped back to chapters I had already read just to see how a particular aspect of the plotline had shown hints of itself before fully unfolding. The need to go back and forth in my reading was not due to any shortcomings on the part of Mr. Ross\u2019 writing, but was instead based on my interest in how Ross managed to get the intricate story to its current point.This initial offering, Lifetime Loser, by James Ross is a great novel for anyone who appreciates the art of creating strong characters on the written page. It is not often that I find myself audibly gasping in reaction to a development in a novel, but the actions of the main players in Lifetime Loser made me do just that. This book is certainly a page-turner, but with a plot that deserves your time to give it a slow and deliberate read. I have no doubt that you will be amazed by some of the situations that our protagonist faces as he simply tries to support his family by helping others play the game that he loves. Ross has a creative mind that translates well to each page of his first book. I look forward to meeting the other people who I hope James Ross chooses to create in the future."}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074335-sherry", "userReview": "First let me start by stating that I am in no way considered to be a book critic. However, I know what holds my interest and what does not. Having said that I recently had the opportunity to read, the James Ross book, Lifetime Loser. This book is the first in a series of 3 novels to date by Mr. Ross.James Ross - AuthorLifetime loserLifetime Loser is a story about greed vs. honesty. Its backdrop is a golf course and there is a well woven plot that involves a naive golf professional, J.W. Schroeder and a very unscrupulous business man, Lew Zerrmann and his equally dishonest associates and acquaintances. Ross takes us on a journey that spans two decades and has enough twists and turns to keep you hanging on every word.For me this book was as interesting a read as a John Grisham or Patricia Cornwell novel (two of my personal favorites). The character development was strong and effectual. The proverbial fight of good vs. evil plays well in this book especially with the focus on greed. It rings so true for today\u2019s world. It is not until the end that you really find out what will happen. There are many surprises even at the end so don\u2019t think you can figure out who wins. You\u2019ll need to read the book.The bottom line is that I ended up putting off some office work to finish this book. It is a real page turner, even if you are NOT a golf fan. I am anxious to begin reading the second of the series, Finish Line. But for now, I have to get back to my office chores. I may have to burn some \u2018midnight oil\u2019 tonight and get into the next story\u2026.Recommendation: A hole-in-one!!"}, {"userName": "Sarah Sammis", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis", "userReview": "It's been about twenty years since the last time I read a novel based around golf. The last one was the very funny The Greening of Thurmond by Michael Zagst (1986).Lifetime Loser by James Ross covers roughly twenty years in the life of J. W. Schroeder or J. Dub to his friends. He is tricked into buying a share in an illegally purchased golf course after washing out of his own chance at a golf career. The rest of the book follows how the initial swindle plays out for all the parties involved.The man behind the swindle is Lewferd E. Zermann whose motivations seem to come down to a love of money and a love of evil. Midway through the book we learn of his shrine to Hitler and he goes from being a plausible greedy bastard to being a character on loan from Springtime for Hitler.The book has its moments and J. Dub is a likeable character but the awkward written narrative gets in the way. Too much of the characterization is done by attributes alone. So an so is the \"best at this\" or \"the worst at that\" and frankly that's not enough to build interesting, believable or memorable characters. The book also suffers from weird mistakes involving incorrect word usage, poor grammar and general typesetting errors. More than anything, Lifetime Loser needs tighter editing."}, {"userName": "Lynn Hallbrooks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5633117-lynn-hallbrooks", "userReview": "I was provided a gifted copy of this book through Masquerade Mob formerly Masquerade Crew Review in exchange for an honest review.This is a mystery story that has golf running through it.In the early 1980s, J Dub was on his way to a promising career on the Pro Golf tour until a faulty decision got in the way. As life would have it, he was offered a job not only running a golf course but as a junior partner. Believing his future would be set, he took on the challenge. Little did he know there were unseen forces at work conspiring to dash his hopes and dreams. Will he be able to compete against them and win or will he be just another lifetime loser?I love how the story spans two decades, showing not only the struggles of balancing work and family life but the joys of friendship despite outside forces trying to drag you down. I can so relate to J Dub's wife on many occasions it seemed to mirror my own life.Warning: This book is for Mature Audiences due to adult language, violence, and moderately explicit sexual situations."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/548040-anne", "userReview": "Sarah Sammis sums up my feelings when she writes: \"The book has its moments and J.

The game and the Prairie Winds golf course are the backdrop for the story.J.W. Shroeder has been a golf fanatic his whole life. J-dub, as he is called decides against the pro circuit and becomes partners with Lew as owners of Prairie Winds. J Dub is a fairly honest man and his partner Lew is about as opposite as you could be and J Dub is finding that out the hard way. This is the first book in this series and I will be reading two more in the collection. I found the book interesting and if you are a fan of golf, law and corruption, grab this."}, {"userName": "Dan Panke", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6201040-dan-panke", "userReview": "When J Dub (J.

It looked like J Dub had found his home at the Prairie Winds Golf Course even after years of deceit unfold.A great deal of time is spent developing the main characters of Lifetime Loser and no villain is more hateful than Lew Zerrmann.
