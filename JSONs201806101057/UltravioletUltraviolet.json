This is so cool.That was my reaction late last night when I finished this book and the feeling hasn't worn off. Ultraviolet is one of those sneaky books that makes you think you're reading one thing and then all the sudden, whoosh, you're off on a different adventure. I think many of us who spend a lot of time in the paranormal genre have come to expect a certain story structure from these types of books, but this one has no problem bending all the rules and leaping out to explore other dimensions. Be careful as reviews start to come in, however, because the less you know about this story, the more you'll enjoy it.The book starts off with a bang: Alison has been institutionalized in a teen mental facility because she's confessed to killing Tori, a girl from school. The problem is, Ali watched her classmate disintegrate in front of her...and the body has disappeared. Since Ali's also seeing colors and tasting lies, she doesn't know whether she's really going crazy or not. She is isolated from her friends and family, she can't relate to the other kids in the facility, and she's being pressured by the police and her psychiatrist to give up information she knows will hurt her. The only one she can turn to is the handsome Dr. Faraday, who helps her understand her synesthesia, an unusual neurological condition in which she processes certain letters as colors, sees symbols where they don't exist, etc. The author spends a lot of time carefully easing us into a familiarity with Alison's condition and making us feel for her situation, and for the longest time I wasn't even sure if she was ever going to make it out of the institution since her mother keeps finding excuses to not to see her. It took me a little while to adjust to her condition as well, but once I settled in I really enjoyed seeing the world through Ali's sensations, even though I wasn't sure where the story was going. And then...just as you're getting comfortable, the author turns everything on its head. Shortly before it happened, I guessed what was going on--but the reveal is so simply and beautifully done that my little heart still fluttered. From that point on, the story kicks into high gear as Alison tries to solve the mystery of what happened to her classmate and to prove--and to believe--that she isn't insane at all. There is a wondrous moment near the end that made me catch my breath that invokes the same sort of feelings I get from lying in a meadow under a giant nightscape of stars and sky--that awesome, bigger-than-life emotion of gazing up into a beauty and mystery that we will never fully understand. It's hard to go into detail here about what made this book so fantastic for me without spoiling it, but as I was reading this scene, I flashed back to the very best work of Madeleine L'Engle and Ray Bradbury. I've often wondered if those two masters of speculative fiction are as beloved by teens today as they were back in the day, because like Ultraviolet, their work trusted their readers enough to peel back their many layers slowly and patiently. I'm not sure how this book will be viewed by modern mass audiences, but I do believe (and hope) that it's going to be critically very well received. It's intelligently written fiction with ideas that stimulate the imagination and move you with what's unspoken...as well as the infinite possibilities of a future yet to come.This review also appears in The Midnight Garden.

By this I mean that three stars is \"I liked it\" and is a mostly positive rating. Therefore, Ultraviolet hovers somewhere halfway between \"I liked it\" and \"I really liked it\" because there were parts I absolutely loved but also many things that got on my nerves and had me mentally lowering my rating. I will say one thing for certain: I need to read the sequel. NOW.The suspense that Anderson builds up in this book is almost palpable, you find yourself questioning everything and experiencing the frustration of someone who is imprisoned in a mental institution when they feel they are innocent, then later the confusion of someone who begins to doubt their own sanity. Being inside Alison's mind is a scary place to find yourself but, though there is a paranormal element to this novel, you soon find that the author has weaved fact with fiction and incorporated a real-world factor into her story - synesthesia. This is something I had only heard of in passing before I read Ultraviolet, but I have since been inspired to do some more research on the topic. I enjoyed this addition to the novel immensely, simply because it would have been far easier - and what I first expected - to explain away a character's special abilities as some weird supernatural phenomenon.However, Alison's synesthesia leads me perfectly onto what was at times the greatest threat to my enjoyment of the book and at other times what made me go wide-eyed with adoring book love - the prose. Some of it reminded me of Shatter Me (but it wasn't that bad or I wouldn't have finished it) and the explanation of synesthesia for the use of colour-based metaphors might make sense but it didn't make it any less annoying for me. Take this:Not only was his voice amazing, so was his name: violet to match his eyes, tranquil and playful at the same time, full of shimmering highlights and unexpected depths. And the Sebastian part wasn't bad either - all oregano and woodsmoke, with a hint of sensuality that made my skin flush just thinking about it.andI preferred handwriting, where every loop sent a flush of aquamarine up my arm as though I'd dipped it in a tropic sea.and\"There. Are. No. Stars,\" she hissed, her voice full of icy peaks and seething valleys.To me, these sentences are not beautiful but eyeroll-worthy. Unlike Shatter Me, though, the use of them wasn't as constant and I didn't have to hurt myself trying to understand the similes and metaphors. The writing in this book walked a very fine line between stunning and grotesque at times, some passages I could have read over and over for hours without getting tired of them and others made me cringe. To balance out the negative, I wanted to include this little paragraph that I thought was beautiful:I heard the universe as an oratorio sung by a master choir of stars, accompanied by the orchestra of the planets and the percussion of satellites and moons. The aria they performed was a song to break the heart, full of tragic dissonance and deferred hope, and yet somewhere beneath it all was a piercing refrain of glory, glory, glory. And I sensed that not only the grand movements of the cosmos, but everything that had happened in my life, was a part of that song.Also, while this novel was highly original for the most part, the romance and the love interest were not. Or at least not for the first two thirds of the book. It began as it usually begins with descriptions of his male perfection, everything from his eyes to his hands to his voice was crafted by the gods, apparently. He is the nicest of the nice, the hottest of the hot... the, um, perfectist of the perfect. Later, he is allowed a few imperfections that help to shape his character and made me like him more but the lack of chemistry at the beginning made it hard to buy into their relationship. Not only that, but it also seemed very inappropriate at first due to the circumstances under which they met.Now, I have to say that I knew what the big twist was before I began this book but I enjoyed it anyway and I don't really think it had much effect on my overall rating. The thing is, it's ridiculously easy to spoil this book for yourself just by looking at its tags and shelves on goodreads - so, you know, try not to glance over to the right side of the page when you add this. Which you totally should do right now. This is a gripping psychological paranormal story that offers a new spin on a very formulaic genre, it is not faultless but it will keep you on the edge of your seat. I am betting that 99% of people who read this will have to read the sequel even if they shared the same problems I had with it."}, {"userName": "Flannery", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/652877-flannery", "userReview": "[Hah.

It seems like nothing I write can ever be good enough. That's exactly the case this time. I'll try to keep it short and very clear: this book blew me away! It took only about 30 pages for me to fall in love with Ultraviolet. If I remember correctly, I called Anderson's writing unpretentious and rich with emotion when I just started reading, and I stand by my words now that I've finished. What amazed me the most about it was the way she occasionally threw a stunning passage or a breathtaking sentence into what was normally pretty simplistic writing.  Dark chocolate, poured over with velvet: that was how his voice tasted. I wanted him to follow me around and narrate the rest of my life.I'm not a visual type of person, but words mean the world to me, and R.J. Anderson's words made a strong impression. The way Alison perceives the world made me want to be her, if just for ten minutes, and experience things and people through her eyes (and her mouth). Tasting words sounds like something I would gladly live with for the rest of my life!I\u2019d been trying to get over my habit of judging people by the color and taste of their names, but it was hard when my instincts were so often right. There seemed no point telling myself that the R in the middle of Kirk\u2019s name didn\u2019t make him untrustworthy when the game had just started and he was already cheating.And then the major plot twist happened. I was a bit annoyed at first because I really liked the way the story was originally going, but after a while, I started to like the new development too, which only proves how amazing R.J. Anderson really is. Another small thing I really liked was the lack of Ali's physical description. I know nothing about the color of her hair, the length of her eyelashes or the way she blushes when she's embarrassed and I like it that way. It was very refreshing not to be bothered with unimportant things like that. Reading Feed has made me reluctant to give five stars as easily as I did before, but they're well deserved this time. I have such high hopes for this book! I hope people will recognize its beauty and its literary value. R.J. Anderson has gained a new fan - I'm ready to read everything she's ever written, including her grocery lists."}, {"userName": "Blythe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5206717-blythe", "userReview": "[ (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Elle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4090840-elle", "userReview": "[take the party into space (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Steph Sinclair", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4642710-steph-sinclair", "userReview": "Ultraviolet was such a pleasant surprise! I've been thinking about this review for a few days because it's hard to say something about it without giving too much away. It's one of those books that you just have to go in knowing absolutely nothing. So, I will try my best to keep this short and sweet. :)Ultraviolet is about a girl named Alison who ends up in a mental institute after she has a psychotic break, during which she confesses to murdering a fellow classmate. What makes this book so cool is that she has synesthesia, a neurological phenomenon, which allows her to see sounds and taste colors. The way Anderson wove this beautiful story had me mesmerized. I fell in love with the way Alison described the world in her senses. I seriously felt like I was watching the Aurora Borealis while reading Ultraviolet. The plot was solid and left the reader to catch up to the mystery surrounding her classmate's death. I really enjoyed that because it added to the suspense. I will say that the plot twist was a tad predictable. There was quite a bit of foreshadowing going on, so it wasn't hard to see where things were going. BUT that did not stop me from really enjoying this book and the ending did surprise me.Things were tied up nicely in this book at the end, but in this case I'm really hoping there will be a sequel.

Ultraviolet is so incredibly original. It was an absolute pleasure to read. The writing is well crafted, elegant, colorful, and beautifully descriptive. It has a captivating quality and I was hooked right from the start. Ultraviolet is the story of a very special teenage girl. Alison finds herself in a psychiatric hospital ward. She believes that she caused a classmate to disintegrate. When the classmate goes missing, Alison confesses to the murder even though no body has been found. Alison has special abilities. She sees numbers in color. She tastes shapes. Music becomes fireworks in her head. Sensations such as pleasure and pain are in color. Alison thinks she is going crazy until a researcher gives a name to her condition \u2013 synesthesia. At this point, I couldn\u2019t help myself. I started googling this condition. Fascinating!The story is told from Alison\u2019s point of view. The reader only knows as much as Alison does. The author doles out little bits of information sparingly like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, keeping the reader in suspense throughout the novel. It really kept me guessing.Suddenly, the story changes. It\u2019s almost like you are reading another book, not in a bad way, just different. And it works, it really does. Ultraviolet is an intelligent young adult novel. There are no love triangles, no real angst, just a young girl trying to find her place in this world. This book made me feel a purplish shade of blue. I\u2019m looking forward to reading more of R. J. Anderson\u2019s books in the future.* ARC provided free of charge from NetgalleyUltraviolet has been featured as a Badass Hidden Gems - Canada eh? edition book here."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4089478-jim", "userReview": "***I have tried to avoid spoilers. If you have read the book, you know how difficult that can be in this case. If you haven\u2019t, you might be well advised to just check it out first, and come back to the reviews later... I REALLY liked it, and will try to walk the tightrope of discussing it without giving it away..///////There is a key moment very early in this book - a flashback to Alison at age 6. She is watching her mom washing dishes, and seeing a trail of gold stars when the cutlery clinks. This visual sensation is very beautiful to Alison, but she has no idea that there is anything unusual about it.She asks for more of the gold stars, and the shock of her mom\u2019s violent and angry reaction is a defining moment in Alison\u2019s life. Her mom\u2019s orders are very clear. There are No stars. Alison is never to mention them, or anything like them to anyone, ever! People will think she is crazy! Allison\u2019s mom thinks so too, while her dad is intelligent but basically clueless on this issue:\u201cMy father was a sweet man, but most of the time he acted like his body was only there to keep his brain from dragging on the ground.\u201dFor Alison, this moment changes everything about her relations with other people. She can never reveal those special perceptions. But they continue and grow more complex as she reaches her teens, a product of some unusual circuitry in her brain and eyes. (I will save other comments on this point for later discussion, if others are interested)\u201cYou know how when some people first take up painting they don\u2019t know how to mix colors properly, and all their pictures end up looking all garish and cheap? It\u2019s like that when I watch TV.\u201d I bought into Alison\u2019s defining, traumatic moment - it made sense to me. A childhood trauma takes away the simple joy of a beautiful set of perceptions, and turns them into a continuing nightmare. Intimidated by her mother\u2019s outraged warning, Alison lives and builds much of her life around these perceptions, but knows she must keep them hidden or society will cast her aside.But what drives much of the story is an even more horrifying turn of events, and the aftermath of this incident puts her in the psychiatric institution that her mother had feared all along. The book begins with her in this institution, piecing together the story (in first person) through her own deep confusion about what really happened, and what is or is not wrong with her. This confusion is a core element of the story - it makes everything she sees, thinks and does highly suspicious, to herself and to everyone around her.\u201cSo I pushed the bitterness down, into the black pit of my stomach along with my regret and my grief and my fear, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m fine. May I go now?\u201d \u201cThe plot twists and turns from this point, and pieces/parts have been carefully indicated in all the reviews that I read. Nearly all of it worked extremely well for me. Having bought into the tortured but exotic inner world of Allison, I was prepared for the tortuous saga that followed. I anticipated some of the twists, though certainly not all. But I enjoyed the story greatly, right through to the end.Your mileage may vary. A lot of trusted reviewers/friends had issues with this one, and it may just not work for you. What is really tricky is that serious readers will react in very different ways to the characters and the twists. I get that. Here is the way I think of it. I love authors who can define a 'world' and make it work. Authors who follow their artistic vision and put it out there as they see it. The world could be almost anything - physical, psychological, pure fantasy, etc. And yes, things can change dramatically as the story rolls along.For me, the \u2018success\u2019 of that world is not so much about what is in it, or even how it works, but how skillful the author is in depicting it. What I am judging is whether the creation hangs together for me. Is it internally consistent? Is the writing clear and moving? Do I care about the characters? Does the story gain momentum and then hold it? In the hands of a lesser writer, I don't think that any part of this story would have drawn me in or held my interest. But Anderson\u2019s writing scored strong positives on all of my criteria. I raced through it to see what would happen next. My pulse was pounding at many points in the story. In the end, I cared strongly about several of the characters and was satisfied with the outcome. Thinking back, what I really enjoyed throughout was the skillful maneuvering of observation, inference and the unsettling new facts. For me, it was a marvelous excursion to see events unfold through the lens of Alison\u2019s confusion, mental instability and her extraordinary perceptions. I was particularly impressed by the deft handling of shifting relationships among the characters, as the stereotyped certainties of one chapter became the deeper and more complex truths of the next. I would definitely read it again.Very Highly Recommended.Special thanks to Wendy Darling for her  excellent review and recommendation. There are many other exceptional reviews of this book, but the  one by Crowinator really resonated with my own take."}, {"userName": "Crowinator", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283407-crowinator", "userReview": "[ It's not every day that an author takes a fairly realistic story and turns it into a balls-out alien conspiracy.

But after coming across positive review after positive review, on a whim (*cough* book buying frenzy *cough*) I bought it.Much has been made of the need to approach Ultraviolet unspoiled, and I agree wholeheartedly with this. But what I\u2019m going to offer here is a review from the perspective of someone who did not read this book entirely unspoiled. Because when it comes to spoilers, I have a click-happy finger. I also have a terrible habit, that I am desperately trying to break, of flicking to the back of a book when I\u2019m browsing in bookstores. When I started reading Ultraviolet, I already knew one fairly major element of the plot (not the ending, by the way, but still a critical detail). Do I wish I hadn\u2019t spoiled myself and been able to experience this book without the taint of foreknowledge? Absolutely. Obviously, I didn\u2019t feel the same impact at the whip-lash turn the story took as some other readers. Did this negatively affect my enjoyment of the book? Not at all. As mentioned at the outset, I fell hard for this book, and had a difficult time putting it down. I missed my tram stop because of this book. Enough said.The synopsis of Ultraviolet certainly has a hook to it. A sixteen year old girl is sectioned in a psychiatric institute, convinced she has killed the most popular girl at school. Yet the manner of the death, and the unique way Alison experiences the world, has her questioning her sanity, unsure where the line between her perceptions and reality lies. \"Everybody has a story, Alison,\" he said. \"Everybody has things they need to hide--sometimes even from themselves.\"I was caught up in Alison\u2019s story within pages, and I attribute this in large part to R J Anderson\u2019s writing, which is just beautiful. At one point I found myself reading with the book held up close to my face, as if I could breathe it in. Stylistically, the prose is rich, yet clear; lush with imagery, yet uncluttered. Alison\u2019s condition is used powerfully to texture the story. It felt like an integral thread carefully woven into the narrative, rather than hastily tacked on or inserted at random. The way Anderson writes Alison\u2019s perspective feels crisp and contemporary, yet at times it is also like seeing the world through a kaleidoscope. \u201dDoors flapped open and slammed shut, like the valves of a pounding heart. Footsteps splattered blue onto the fluorescent orange shriek of the alarm, and the air thickened with shouting voices..\u201d(Interestingly, going into this book knowing what I did, Anderson\u2019s writing also lends itself to some subtle and smooth foreshadowing. Cue me smiling a little, thinking \u2018oh, I see what you did there..\u2019)Another aspect of the writing I loved was the characterisation, and the way that even the secondary characters were real and vital. Anderson\u2019s treatment of mental illness felt respectful and well-handled, using Alison\u2019s own perceptions as a lens through which to view common misconceptions. Additionally, one of the characters I came to love began as possibly the most unlikely candidate, (and I can\u2019t write that in a less convoluted manner without spoiling \u2013 suffice to say that enjoyed the way in which Anderson chose to develop her characters and subvert certain stereotypes).Ultraviolet does not neatly fit within the usual parameters of a given genre, which is perhaps why I ended up enjoying it as much as I did. The book largely avoids most of the tropes I was expecting, rather it blends different genre elements and becomes something of a hybrid. It is this deft sidestepping of expectations, as much as the characters themselves, that kept the story gripping for me.Despite the fact that I was prepared for one of the elements of the plot that the twist hinges upon, I still found Ultraviolet a compelling read. It was emotionally engaging, expressive and entertaining, which is basically my own personal trifecta of reading enjoyment (er, and a chance to abuse my alliteration privileges, apparently).While a companion novel is purportedly in the pipeline for 2013, Ultraviolet works beautifully as a standalone, ending on a lingering, slightly haunting, final note.Lastly, Sebastian Faraday. All I will say here is that his name is a bit of a \"Cellar Door\" for me, in terms of phonaesthetics. I just wanted to keep saying it... :)\n\""}, {"userName": "Scarlet", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3839903-scarlet", "userReview": "[Allison's therapist turns out to be an alien.Her classmate Tori, who 'disintegrated' according to the blurb was just sucked into another dimension.Oh, and Tori is an alien too.But they're not aliens, they are actually humans who come from another colony.And of course, the human Allison is in love with her human-yet-alien therapist.WTF.Ever since The 5th Wave, the word 'alien' in YA makes me see red (no synesthesia-related pun intended).

After finishing the book I sat there thinking to myself what has just happened?In Ultraviolet we are told the story through Alison; she\u2019s found herself in a psych unit after admitting she killed Tori a girl from school. Tori, hasn\u2019t been seen since, but her blood was found at school at the spot where Alison the last person to have seen her had a confrontation with her. Alison\u2019s mum has always believed Alison\u2019s not right, so Pine Hills is the best place for her, whereas everyone else including Alison herself just wants to discover the truth.Ultraviolet took me a while to warm up to, it had an unusual premise, but once we started to get down to the nitty gritty with Alison, I found myself fallen head first into an unbelieving world, but in no way I wanted to leave.Ultraviolet was multi-layered and complex, but Anderson was able to produce a masterly woven plot. It had aspects where I assumed I knew what was going to happen, but then was totally flummoxed by what was around the corner. I liked the way Anderson slowly took us into Alison\u2019s life, and opened nooks and crannies that even Alison hadn\u2019t been aware of, how we were pushed deeper into her life and emerged with so many fascinating facts.Alison was a character who I enjoyed being with, she couldn\u2019t understand what was going on either, whether she really killed Tori, so I liked going through this journey with her, slowly unravelling the mystery surrounding herself and what really happened. It was like she was wearing blinkers her entire life and she couldn\u2019t really see what was really happening. Until that one person came into her life who had that faith in her that she needed to give her the confidence to believe in herself. This one character I\u2019m just a loss for words when describing him, it could probably be best summed up by Alison\u201cI was terrified of losing..., a soul mate so perfectly made for me that even now I was half afraid I\u2019d invented him\u201d.And Alison nails it with this quote what Ultraviolet is really about. We are often led to believe so much, but how honestly can we say that it\u2019s true? It\u2019s like me and my best friend can see the same fight but have totally different takes on it afterwards. My sense of reality can be quite different to another\u2019s.

Her choices while in the institution come under a sharp focus, as does her relationship with her family. Not to say that the science fiction story that kicks everything off and dominates the second half of the book is bad: it's not. It's just that the mental health elements of the book are the strongest.Fairly good YA SF with a unique and vulnerable protagonist."}, {"userName": "Nic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2813423-nic", "userReview": "Favourite Quote: \"I might not be ready to pour out my feelings to the world, but I\u2019d had enough of trying to ignore them.\"Wow! Ultraviolet is an incredibly original and hypnotic read. I just loved how refreshingly different it was from the plot to the characters to even the style of writing. Everything was unique and it that made for such a standout read.Ultraviolet is the story of Alison who is placed in a psychiatric unit after complete breakdown. She is also the main suspect in the murder case of the most popular girl at school Tori. But nobody knows what happened including Alison as there is no body. All Alison can remember is one moment she was arguing with Tori then next thing she had disintegrated into thin air. Is Alison going crazy? Or there an extraordinary answer for it all?The plot pulls you in from the first page and you are completely hooked until the end. It is filled with some very delicious unexpected twists. I really thought I knew what was going on but I had no idea. I love that Ultraviolet was not what I expected because it ended up being so much more.R.J. Anderson writing is alluring and vividly descriptive especially when it came to describing Alison condition of synesthesia - tasting words, how each letter has a personality and a colour and in general just seeing so much more than the rest of us. It was definitely interesting element to the story and made Alison an extraordinary character.\"Seconds shaded into minutes, and the butterflies in my stomach had turned into biting horseflies, when a candy-pink squeal of delight rippled down the corridor towards me.\"Alison had an utterly convincing voice. She had to deal with some hard situations - locked in a mental facility, possibly killing someone, thinking she might be going crazy but her reactions were always believable. Now Faraday in a unforgettable character. Smart, kind and surprising. I only wish we had gotten more of him because I really enjoyed his presence in the story.\"Dark chocolate, poured over velvet: that was how his voice tasted. I wanted him to follow me around and narrate the rest of my life.\" As for the romance it definitely didn't feel like the typical young adult romantic situation. It was that something special and yet it didn't take the focus away from the amazing plot.Overall, Ultraviolet is a stunning out of the ordinary read. I definitely recommend it to people looking for something different but yet still an exceptional story. Now I just need to get my hands on more of R.J. Anderson's books."}, {"userName": "Limonessa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4147373-limonessa", "userReview": "In every novel worth its name there is an abundance of figures of speech such as metaphor, simile, oxymoron. They are part of the texture of the narration and are employed to enforce the first rule of Writing 101, which is to show and not to tell.I remember quite distinctly having studied rhetorical figures during my high school years in Italian classes and I knew synesthesia from such classes. I still remember one example quite distinctly taken from a poem by Pascoli: \u201cun pigolio di stelle\u201d \u2013 a chirping of stars. In a synesthesia you juxtapose two terms which belong to two different sensorial plains, ex. \u201ca bitter smell\u201d.I never, ever knew it could be \u2013 actually, the figure of speech probably comes from \u2013 a neurological condition.In this book, at least in the first part, such figures of speech not only abound, but are the foundation on which the whole novel is based. Alison wakes up in a mental ward. She barely remembers what led her to being committed, except that she\u2019s had a mental breakdown and that she probably has murdered her high school nemesis by\u2026. disintegrating her. With the help of Faraday, a fascinating therapist, she will discover the truth behind her unlikely condition and what really happened the night she does not remember.This book is, without a doubt, the weirdest I have read in a long time. It starts off as one genre and then, three quarters into it, completely turns into something else. And when I say weird I mean that it\u2019s like you\u2019re reading a scene from Wuthering Heights and Martin McFly on the Delorean comes stealing the scene. That kind of weird. But I\u2019d rather not talk about the plot or the characters any more because it\u2019s really better if you go into this book by not knowing anymore than what I already said.I am still not sure I completely appreciated the plot twist and probably never will make up my mind. I really, really liked the first part and for me it was a 5 star all the way but all of a sudden\u2026 the plot takes a weird turn, the register drops, the figures of speech disappear and\u2026 you might or might not like it. It still deserves a solid four stars in my opinion, the writing is extremely good, well worth reading this original story but I have to confess that to me it kind of stopped making sense from a certain point on. In fact, the question that was in my mind while reading and that honestly I still haven\u2019t completely discarded is: is Alison an unreliable narrator?To me this question is still open, and since I am pretty sure there is going to be a \u2013 or maybe multiple \u2013 sequel/s to this YA book which certainly deserves a special attention and that deviates from \u201cthe usual\u201d, I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens next.Definitely recommended, the writing is exceptional."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4515165-sandy", "userReview": "4.5 out of 5 starsSo unexpected in such a good way. It's impossible to talk about how amazing this book is without delving into spoiler territory, so I'm keeping my recommendation vague and short: READ THIS.You start with that stellar hook (kudos to R.J. for captivating me from chapter zero) and you think you know what type of book Ultraviolet is going to be, but then it completely twists and morphs through different genres to become an entirely different book. And R. J. Anderson makes it WORK.(Can I just say how refreshing it is to have a scientific explanation for a character's special abilities? None of this you have these powers 'cuz you just do. Nope. There is a brilliant explanation for everything that happens in this book, and I. LOVED. IT.)I recommend going into this one blind. I didn't even read the blurb--I just started reading--and that enhanced the experience of immersing myself in this absorbing, mind-bending novel.Lastly, that GORGEOUS writing. There is some stunning imagery in Ultraviolet that touches all of the senses. I was swept away by the unique, stirring descriptions for the way Alison senses the world. It's unlike anything I've read this year. Where did R.J. come up with so many different ways to describe the mundane things we see and hear every day?

Fortunately I had an entire day to devote to Ultraviolet because I was completely hooked. If you are reading this review you must have read the synopsis and know that it begins with sixteen (almost seventeen) year old Alison waking up in a psychiatric facility. Alison initially has no recollection of what placed her in the hospital, and in fact does not even have a history of mental illness. Author R.J.Anderson does an amazing, simply amazing job of setting the stage for \"is Alison crazy or isn't she?\" The fine line between mental illness and paranormal activity is one of my all time favorite book subjects and it is done so very well here. And of course there is the twist in this book...holy fuck! I had a vague idea, but never in a million years thought Anderson would go there. But she did, and it worked! However, is it only the mystery plot line which makes this book so great? Ah...yes and no. On one hand, there is the surprise and uniqueness factor. Ultraviolet is well written and for sure stands alone amongst so many contemporary YA's. But on the other hand, once we arrived at the, er... twisty aspect of the novel, the writing was slightly rushed and not quite up to the same standard it had been. Granted, this portion of the novel was heavy on the action, so some rushing is expected but somehow it just felt too out of tune with the rest of the writing. Finally, I wish the supporting characters had been more fully developed. Although we do learn so much about Alison's family, her BFF Melissa, and the other patients at the psychiatric facility I can't help but feel we see them at a distance. That is, rather than reading a well developed novel, it feels as if we are seeing them solely through Alison's eyes. This is a hard point for me to critique though, because Alison is shy, aloof, and frequently lost in her own world. So it is expected that she does not provide, or imagine in depth characterizations of these people. However, as the reader of this novel, I really wanted to know them all a little more intimately. For those who don't mind excessive descriptions and imagery and are looking for something intense and different, Ultraviolet is a book I whole-hardheartedly recommend. It is mysterious, beautifully written, and took me on one heck of an emotional journey."}, {"userName": "Veronique", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12371602-veronique", "userReview": "\u201cEverybody has a story, Alison,\" he said. \u201cEverybody has things they need to hide--sometimes even from themselves.\u201d To set a novel mostly in a mental institute was something I just couldn\u2019t miss. And Anderson pulls it off brilliantly. Here we have the experience of a teenager finding herself in such a place, trying to deal with her situation. Why is she here? What happened? How is she going to adapt to this restricted and indeed disturbing \u2018asylum\u2019? Through her own experience and what she sees of others, the author paints a raw picture of how people with mental illnesses are treated, chipping little by little at all the taboos and unsavoury aspects, shining a torch at them, all to make us understand that nothing is as bad as imagined. Yes, there is pain and injustice and violence and anger and plenty of other emotions, but that is not the whole thing, and our perceptions can and often are totally askew. The many characters and relationships offered here are complex, and hidden in a way. The author does choose some very interesting paths that don\u2019t become visible until the end, playing with our understanding of the people around us, and especially ourselves. Then, Anderson adds the synaesthesia card, and again I\u2019m beyond sold. I\u2019ve been fascinated by this for quite a while now, wondering how it would be to taste or see sounds. Sadly, it is only too easy to understand how people could have misunderstood this and seen only schizophrenia. The story does dip into science fiction, which wasn\u2019t needed - the book would have been perfect without it - but I can see the appeal of it too.

Told through the eyes and life of Alison Jeffries, a seventeen year old girl, Alison is both a very unreliable narrator and a hugely sympathetic character. R.J. Anderson truly achieved the voice, and attitude of a sullen, hurting young woman. Alison is a living, breathing, three-dimensional character filled with flaws, virtues and humanity. As Alison, the narrative is filled with passion and viable emotions and thoughts. Her wry (and often self-deprecating) humor were dead on the mark for a teenager who has been taught to be ashamed of all she is and can do.This is a novel that was crafted with delicacy and much planning. It is laden with clues, subtle hints, and hidden meanings deep in the imagery-heavy, sensory-rich prose. I do not feel that revealing Alison has synesthesia as a spoiler -- it's out mentioned in the in the ads. Words, numbers, sounds all have personalities, colors, smells thanks to her possessing five different kinds of the phenomenon. Alison, while driving in a car states, \"[...]I wanted to hear the landscape, taste its contours, and smell its hues,\" as only she can. Her amazingly vivid condition fits the lush style of the writing well: it's as close as the reader will ever get to experience life the way Alison does. I was so interested in this very real condition that I researched it online and I am beyond impressed with the depth of research and history Anderson went to in order for this story to work on the levels it does.I enjoyed the fresh scenery: I've not read any hardly any novels set in Canada and the change of scene was a nice harbinger of the individuality to follow. The atmosphere of the story was completely enveloping. Even necessary the parts of the novel (for example Part One was The Scent of Yesterday, chapters are titled Zero(Is Translucent), One (Is Gray), Ten (Is Vulernable), etc.) are subtle reminders that hearken back to the most fascinating aspect of the novel: Alison's abilities. The first part of the novel focuses much more on the mystery aspect of Alison's story: what exactly did happen to Tori, and was Alison in any way responsible for Tori's death/disappearance. Part one was intense and impossible to extract myself from as the pieces were slowly revealed. The more Alison pulls herself and her memory together, details about the mysterious event are doled out like nuggets of gold. The true events of the mystery are parceled out so stingily, for the first hundred pages I genuinely could not decide if I believed Alison was sane or not. Now that's an unreliable narrator: one who does not even trust herself or her recollections. Part two (Present Sense) suffers just a bit from a rushed, slightly uneven tempo, but happily the problem was short-lived: part three (Touching Tomorrow) managed to be well-rounded, nicely executed and soulful conclusion to a delightfully surprising novel. The ending is more bitter than sweet, but is entirely appropriate and fitting for Alison's journey. There are a few opportunities and plot-lines left open for exploration in a possible sequel, one I can only hope is written soon.his is definitely more of a plot-driven novel. The rush to figure out what happened to Alison, to Tori, to be placed under her own cognizance, moves the characters more than romance or friendship. There was a deft touch with the tension in the novel: it builds slowly, marginally and then ratchets up to 11 in the final scenes. I hardly minded the plot-focus because I was entirely caught up in the uniquely creative language and prose. Descriptions like \"his hair was the color of a thunderstorm reflected in a mud puddle\" will win me over any day of the week., especially if interpersonal interaction is not a strong point of the author's. And, to be honest, some of the love/emotional scenes were a bit too saccharinely sweet for my taste. However, I do love creative, innovative writers than can make their words and ideas pop: R.J. Anderson is definitely one such author.This is a novel that more than lives up to its advertising byline: Everything You Know Is Wrong. But you'll only know why if you read this novel. Its unique premise, gorgeous prose, full of quotes to love, and more than helluva twist more than recommend it.\"I heard the universe as an oratorio sung by a master choir accompanied by the orchestra of the planets and the percussion of satellites and moons. The aria they performed was a song to break the heart, full of tragic dissonance and deferred hope, and yet somewhere beneath it all was a piercing refrain of glory, glory, glory. And I sensed that not only the grand movements of the cosmos, but everything that had happened in my life, was a part of that song. Even the hurts that seemed most senseless, the mistakes I would have done anything to erase--nothing could make those things good, but good could still come out of them all the same, and in the end the oratorio would be no less beautiful for it.\""}, {"userName": "Ceilidh", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3229028-ceilidh", "userReview": "I am a sucker for the dark side of literature. Growing up, I went through a massive phase of reading books about crime, serial killers and down-trodden detectives looking to solve the case, so seeing the synopsis of this book on NetGalley made it an instant must read for me. The book was surprising on many levels and it\u2019s a real genre bender, not quite the straight forward dark thriller I thought it was going to be, but did it work?Some of it worked rather well. It becomes evident very early on that Alison has the condition synaesthesia, where one\u2019s senses cross over and interact in interesting ways. For Ali, this involves different numbers and letters having distinctive tastes and colours as well as some surprising experiences that occur throughout the book. I really enjoyed the way this was incorporated into the story and it provided a fascinating view of the world from a truly unique perspective. Anderson\u2019s prose is particularly strong during these points and also rather beautiful. The more lyrical moments of prose don\u2019t always work within the context of the story though; sometimes it felt a little jarring. It was always enjoyable to read but I questioned whether it was the right stylistic choice at these moments in time. While Ali\u2019s narration is fascinating, it also means we sometimes don\u2019t get a fully realised view of the world she lives in. This isn\u2019t a problem to begin with \u2013 Anderson effectively creates a sense of foreboding and intrigue as Ali discovers what has happened \u2013 but then it goes a little off the rails, mainly because of Ali.I didn\u2019t mind Ali as a character. I understood her fear and sympathised with it for most of the book, plus her narration, as I said, was very lyrical and interesting at times. However, her decision making process left me feeling a little frustrated. I\u2019m not a fan of characters avoiding the obvious for the sake of plot development. Sometimes it felt like Ali wasn\u2019t allowed to progress because the author had decided it wasn\u2019t time for that yet. While I understood Ali\u2019s difficulties and worries over making certain choices, it still didn\u2019t feel natural. I also felt like we didn\u2019t get a lot of characterisation for the supporting players, especially Ali\u2019s fellow patients and the mysterious Dr Faraday. There are two small, very specific things in the book that I really want to touch upon, and to do this there may be slight spoilers. Unfortunately, the book casually drops in one of my biggest irritants in YA fiction \u2013 the casual gay joke. One of Ali\u2019s fellow patients, who is bipolar, makes several references to Dr Faraday being gay (he isn\u2019t gay but the boy, whose name I have unfortunately forgotten, keeps saying he is out of jealousy, I think) and no-one chastises him for it. Ali silently expresses disapproval but nobody points out how stupid and insulting it is to casually use homosexuality as a negative marker of someone. The boy was frequently punished for saying stupid thing so why not this? It\u2019s a small thing, I know, but I\u2019ve seen it used so frequently in fiction without any character, or even the omniscient narration, taking the time to say it\u2019s wrong, and it bugs me because we\u2019ve still got this society that uses \u2018That\u2019s gay\u2019 as some ultimate insult. Homosexuality is still somehow the acceptable insult these days.  The other problematic element I had also involves this young man forcing himself on Ali. She pushes him back, screams and makes it pretty clear that she doesn\u2019t want this and when the boy has the audacity to be insulted by this, she say sorry. Even though she mentions in her narration that she really isn\u2019t sorry, she still says it. She didn\u2019t have to say it! She wasn\u2019t the one at fault here; mental illness or not, the woman, or man, shouldn\u2019t apologise for having someone force his or herself upon her/him! Later on, the issue is dealt with and the boy is punished but this little scene still nagged at me so I had to address it.Overall, I like a lot of thing about \u201cUltraviolet.\u201d The incorporation of synaesthesia was fascinating and well handled, providing an often beautiful and unique narration, and the set-up is intriguing for the most part. I admire Anderson for taking the book out of the comfort zone and not sticking to the well worn and seductively easy routes YA has so often been taking lately. It doesn\u2019t always work but I was never bored by what I read, even if some of it was a little sketchily developed. The strong elements that kept me reading were let down by some weaker moments of plotting and characterisation. I\u2019m really not sure how to rate this book. It\u2019s either a 2.5 or a 3 out of 5. There\u2019s definitely a lot to enjoy in the book and it\u2019s refreshing to see something unique in the genre right now, but for all its strengths it could have definitely been stronger. 2.5 or 3/5 (apologies for my indecisiveness, I genuinely spent ages trying to pick one and couldn\u2019t!)"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5164756-angela", "userReview": "[synesthesia (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Laura Lulu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1648704-laura-lulu", "userReview": "4.5 starsWow. Really cool book. I don't know where to begin. I feel like anything I write in this review will be a bit of a spoiler in one way or another, so I'll try to be vague.The story is told in first person from the POV of Alison, a 16 year old girl who can see sounds and smell emotions and taste lies. Numbers each have a color, names have a personality, and the stars make music. And she has hidden this extra side of herself since she was 6 years old and shared it with her mother, who proceeded to freak out and tell Alison to never say anything like that ever again.So Alison keeps it to herself, which of course turns her into a distant person, never really sharing any of herself. How can she, when she needs to keep secret so much of what makes her her?So, on to our story. Things happen, and Alison ends up in a mental institution for teens. Alison doesn't remember what happened, all she knows is that a girl from school is missing, a girl Alison hated, and the last thing Alison remembers is getting in a fight with said girl, and the girl disintegrating. Huh? People don't disintegrate. Do they?What proceeds is a wild ride of mystery, self-discovery, and craziness. And because the book is written in first person and you're in Alison's head, you're never sure what is TRUTH. I questioned stuff right up to the end. Is this really happening? Is she crazy and imagining this? And that adds to it's awesomeness.This books does some crazy genre jumping. The genres involved are right up my alley, so it totally worked for me, but I'm concerned that the ratings for this book might end up being a bit lower, just based on people reading along, thinking they were reading one thing and all of a sudden--WTF??? I myself am a big fan of WTF when done nicely, and this was done nicely. But my absolute favorite part of this book was the prose.
