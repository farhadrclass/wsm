Michael Helms, Deadly Dunes is the third title in his outstanding Mac McClellan Mystery series. Very highly recommended reading action/adventure mystery buffs, Deadly Dunes is certain to be an enduringly popular addition to community library collections. Also very highly recommended are the two earlier titles in this superbly written series: Deadly Catch (9781616148676, $15.95 PB, $9.59 Kindle) and Deadly Ruse (9781616140090, $15.95 PB, $9.59 Kindle, 239 pp).Review of Deadly Dunes (Mac McClellan #3) by Lori Leger, for InD'tale Magazine - 4.5 StarsWhen a local archeologist supposedly takes his own life, his sister hires former Marine turned P.I. Mac McClellan to investigate the case. She insists her brother was murdered because of his finds on Five Mile Island off the panhandle coast of Florida. The sister also dies under mysterious circumstances, adding to and removing names from Mac\u2019s list of suspects. More snooping leads to two more deaths and an attempt on Mac\u2019s life, letting him know he\u2019s definitely on the right track. Aided by his girlfriend, Kate, his Doberman puppy named Henry the Eighth, and a female deputy named Dakota, he closes in on the mystery. Can he solve it before it gets too dangerous?\u201cDeadly Dunes\u201d is a fabulous whodunit, written in first person narrative\u2014think Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe\u2014a la classic hardboiled, detective movie style. The writing is nearly flawless, with a nice arc and plausible storylines. The characters are so fleshed out that this reader could picture Mac, dressed in cargo shorts and flip flops, flipping steaks and burgers on his grill, with his faithful pup at his feet. This being Mac\u2019s first case after becoming a licensed P.I., he made a few mistakes, understandably, that put him in danger, or temporarily led him down the wrong path. All were newbie mistakes that only led to the story\u2019s credibility, in this reviewer\u2019s humble opinion.

I enjoyed the mix of history with the mystery. The aura that permeated the tale was both inviting and suspenseful. Helms has created a work of art, backed up by the beautiful scenery of the area in which he set this novel.The military based characters were so real. I enjoyed how Helms stripped away the larger than life aura that we so often see in literature and presented the people as they really are. Yet at the same time, the cast was comprised of so much more than just ex-military. Everyone involved in the tale was a blast to get to know. For those who\u2019ve been following the series, becoming reacquainted with individuals was a lot of fun, and for those reading this novel on its own, there\u2019s more than enough development to get to know them here. Being someone who shops for books based on the cover, I\u2019ve got to comment on this one. The realism of the picture really caught my eye. It\u2019s definitely one I\u2019d pick up for a second look if I were looking for a mystery.As a whole, this was a good, clean mystery that had me on my toes from page 1 to the very end. The enjoyable writing style backed up the solid plot to create a novel that mystery lovers will have a ball with.

Jessie had just showed Mac artifacts and a copy of a map Jake found, items that indicate Hernando de Soto and his explorers might have camped on Five Mile Island during the winter of 1539-1540. Studying the map, Mac determines the site lies in the middle of a planned resort, The Dunes. Declaring the area an historic site could shut the project down. Suspicions aroused, he forges ahead, even though he no longer has a paying client. Everywhere Mac turns, greed abounds, and no one he interviews seems innocent, even Jessie's closest friends the Deckers, who have adopted her teenage daughter. Ron Decker's construction company is building the Dunes, and he is heavily invested in its success. Then there is the oily son and ex-stripper wife of an old curmudgeon who won't sell the one lot the project still needs to acquire. Jake's estranged wife Laurel had plenty to gain from his death, and as Mac continues to dig, he begins to wonder if Jessie herself had more at stake than he was led to believe. No one is happy about Mac's persistence, and someone is unhappy enough to crash his truck and frame him for yet another murder. But Mac isn't giving up, no matter what the cost. Book 3 in the Mac McClellan Mystery series.--------------------My take......My third time with author E. Michael Helms and his series character, ex-career soldier, turned PI, Mac McLellan. The first two in the series, Deadly Catch and Deadly Ruse were enjoyed before.http://col2910.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09...http://col2910.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02...Mac is entrusted by boss Frank Hightower with his first case - a grieving sister is unconvinced by her brother's recent death being written off as suicide. Mac is hired to look into things. The background being that the recently deceased Jake was an archaeologist and he claimed to have discovered some historic artifacts that could put a proposed property development in doubt.A day after he signs on, his client dies in a freak automobile accident. Unwilling to believe in such an unlikely occurrence being accidental, Mac without a client and against the wishes of his boss has himself a murder, possibly two to investigate.With a massive resort development and money to be made, or conversely money to be lost if the site gets closed down - profit or ruin can provide a powerful motive for murder. Mac's inquiries throw up a few candidates and reveal some secrets of a personal nature when he digs into our dead siblings - Jessie and Jake's extended families. I needed a wall chart to keep track of the bedroom shenanigans, something Helms chooses to allude to as opposed to graphically depict. Who did what to whom and when and what consequences subsequently transpired.There's a few memorable characters encountered along the way. Amos Moats is an eccentric and the last hold-out refusing to sell his land to the developers. When Mac persuades hims to put down the shotgun long enough for a chat, he discovers Moats' ex-stripper wife left him for his own son - a sleazy lawyer. Fair play to her though, she does drop by once a month to do her wifely duty!Mac away from the case, has his blossoming romance with girlfriend Kate still burning bright - and there's just the right amount of personal thrown into the tale to keep it fresh and interesting. The banter between the pair adds to the story.Overall - interesting, enjoyable and engaging. Plenty to like here - decent story, likable main characters, action, humour and a decent resolution. Plenty of legs in Helms' Mac McLellan yet.4 from 5E.

We like a lot of the same things and I am eager to get this adventure on the \u2018road\u2019.Mac reminds me of Tom Selleck in Jesse Stone and Magnum PI.

I think we may be going on a treasure hunt.As the bodies mount, greed raises its ugly head. Is anybody telling the truth\u2026about anything?I love the fun and lively banter between Mac and Kate.

A priceless map drawn by 16th century explorers. Coded messages in Spanish and English. Femme fatales and callous businessmen. Snipers and lying women. Suicide and murder. Sex and intrigue. Like a complex stew, there are many layers to Deadly Dunes, the third installment in the highly-entertaining Mac McClellan series, and although I greedily consumed this mystery in one sitting, I\u2019d recommend slowing down, savoring the many flavors. The setup: McClellan is hired to investigate the alleged suicide of an archeology professor, who just so happens to have stumbled across a map from Hernando de Soto\u2019s 1539 exploration of a place called Five Mile Island, an idyllic spot on the coast of Florida. Little does McClellan know that the map will draw him into the always dangerous world of big money real estate development, and before long, he\u2019s embroiled in yet another complex web of lies, money, and murder. The only question is: can McClellan, a retired Marine turned P.I., discover the truth, thwart the bad guys, and remain in one piece? This is a solid mystery with plenty of red herrings and double-crossings to keep the reader guessing until the end. But, as always, the thing I enjoyed the most was Mac McClellan. A drinker of Budweiser, an avid fisherman, a man\u2019s man with a sarcastic tongue and a secret chivalrous streak, McClellan has quickly become one of my favorite P.I.s, and I look forward to his next adventure.

Michael Helms has become one of my closest author friends over the last few years. I was introduced to him in 2013 when I first read his historical fiction novel, Of Blood & Brothers: Book One. I was an instant fan and I went on to read Of Blood & Brothers: Book Two, The Proud Bastards, The Private War of Corporal Henson, Deadly Catch, Deadly Ruse, and now Deadly Dunes. As I loved more and more of his books we became better friends. I wanted to put that out there so you understand why I rave so much about this author. He's incredibly talented and well worth reading. If he wasn't, I wouldn't have invested 3 years in to his books.Deadly Dunes is the third book in Helms' \"Mac McClellan\" mystery series. The books all take place in south Florida (where I was living when I first started reading them and is yet another reason why I love them). Mac is mega-persistent and this case is a really fun one (if you can call a murder mystery 'fun'). Archaeology and Hernando De Soto history abound as Mac pieces the case together. If you're in to history and love to try to solve a great mystery then I have to recommend the Mac McClellan books by Helms."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6780778-jeanne", "userReview": "Deadly Dunes is a good, old-fashioned mystery with multiple suspects, twists in plots, and plenty of clues to keep everyone guessing.Through a complicated web of clues and red herrings, the reader may have a difficult time keeping up with private investigator, Mac McClellan. He is an interesting, likable character, more so than, say, Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher, but with the same knack to survive dangerous situations unscathed. The sassy interplay between Mac and his feisty lady friend, Kate, is just enough to fit into and balance the fast action story. I like her. I also like Dakota, a flirty female deputy, who would gladly step into Kate\u2019s shoes if the opportunity arose.The story takes place in the panhandle of Florida, a new location for me. Without dumping information on us, Helms gives the reader a good sense of the area\u2019s culture, people, and geography. He even gives us a healthy dose of local history by using buried artifacts as part of the plot.

It's soooooo addicting!!! If you're looking for an enthralling mystery series that's relatively new, and is fast, fun, witty and a bit gritty  -  and oh so delightfully entertaining  -Helms' Mac McClellan series is for you! Mac is such a likable, aptly flawed guy. The sort of guy you'd like to chew the fat with while sipping a cold one. He's Semper Fi reliable, slightly old-fashioned, aloofly hip, gentlemanly southern, believable, reliable, intelligent, and slightly egocentric in a red-blooded-American-male sort of way - but with decorum. And with each new installment, Mac seems more like an actual person rather than a mere character. In regards to wit and grit, he somewhat reminds me of John Corey of Nelson DeMille fame. Except, Mac isn't quite as expletive prolific. Per my tastes, that's a good thing! DEADLY DUNES: The third installment and another winning page-turner. Yes, 'page-turner' is cliche, but what else can I say? I read the book in one day - turning pages late into the night because it was simply that engrossing! (Rhyming unintentional) And too, it's fast-paced with a tightly knitted plot. Helms doesn't go overboard with excessive verbiage and/or long-toothed backstories. He stays true to genre. No straying off on tangential prose or literary embellishments. Okay, I'm obviously guilty of tangential mumbo jumbo. But now, back on track.... In \"Deadly Dunes\" Mac embarks on his first 'official' case as a newly licensed private investigator. The case sounds quite fascinating. Artifacts connected to fifteenth century Spanish explorers were found on \"Five Mile Island\" by Jessie's brother Jake. Normally such a find would be celebratory. Not so in this case. Jake turns up dead, and Jessie hires Mac to find out why. The official police report states suicide as cause of death. With Jake's mental health history, perhaps so. But when Mac begins investigating, things just don't add up. There's a whole lot more to the case than meets the eye: houses are ransacked, shots are fired, investments are going sour, witnesses turn up missing, and there's more swanky, hanky-panky going on relating to the dunes than fleas on a dog's bum..... And Mac is caught in the cross-hairs.

Jake was an associate professor of archaeology at Florida State University who was on his way to conduct preliminary research on possible archaeology sites. His findings would possibly have shut down a multi-million dollar Florida community development. He was found dead in his car from a gunshot wound that was made to look like he committed suicide, but it was later found he was heavily sedated with his wife\u2019s drugs. Exactly two months to the day after her brother was killed, Jessie died as a result of an automobile accident. Mac took the death hard. Although he only had his private eye license for six weeks and he no longer had a client, Mac decided to keep the case open at his own expense. He found Jessie had also been heavily sedated when she hit a bridge abutment. During his investigation, Mac found out that the man who adopted Jessie\u2019s daughter was the owner of the construction company building the Dunes. There was one lot left to purchase before the development could move forward and that was a historic site right in the middle of the land. Mac continued the investigation on his own, but at great risk. Someone wanted him dead.Deadly Dunes by E. Michael Helms is the third book in the Mac McClellan Mystery series following Deadly Catch and Deadly Ruse. The award-winning series has taken readers from the beginning when Mac retired from the military to his becoming a private investigator and his growing relationships with his girlfriend, Katie, and his fellow investigator, Hank, who is teaching him the ropes.This story is addictive and an easy one to get lost in as the reader continues to turn pages. The characters are well drawn, the even pace builds tension, and the ending satisfies. The author is adept at creating settings and has an eye for detail giving one the feeling they are a part of the landscape."}, {"userName": "M.J.

Michael Helms. This series is certain to become a classic in its genre and already has an award winner in 2015. \u201cDeadly Dunes\u201d has the Helms trademark air tight plot that leaves the reader breathless. It is easy for the reader to fall in love with Mac and be hooked on his wit and personality while gripped by the snaky story as it unfolds. In \u201cDeadly Dunes\u201d an archeologist dies under what his sister considers suspicious circumstances. Mac is hired and takes on a greedy corporation intent on buying up Five Mile Island on the Florida coast piece by piece as it aims for a stranglehold to own the island and build a posh resort. No matter that the remains of the winter stay of Hernando De Soto\u2019s ancient expedition in the form of artifacts have been discovered in the middle of the proposed building site by Mac with a map and a code. There is only one holdout who will not sell, an eccentric old man conveniently found dead (who inflicts his own revenge in the end). The plot stiffens as Mac forces a rogue\u2019s gallery of possible suspects with lots to lose should the island be declared an historic site to show their hands in one way or another. One surprise twist after another leaves Mac in grave danger after the murders and he uses his stubborn resourcefulness and military knowhow to save himself and solve the mystery. \u201cDeadly Dunes\u201d features a new character in the form of a Doberman puppy rescued by Mac\u2019s girlfriend Kate, who gifts him the puppy so he now has a roommate. What better breed for an ex-Marine. Like a straight shot of Grey Goose, the classy writing in \u201cDeadly Dunes\u201d is smooth and pleasurably descriptive as Helms leads the reader from scene to scene with proficient skill. Both male and female readers will be, as I was, captivated by his iron hand in the velvet glove approach.

Single mom, Jessie, hires him to investigate her archaeologist brother\u2019s death. She didn\u2019t believe it was suicide as the authorities suggested. He had too much to live for. Then Jessie is killed in an accident. It all seems a little too coincidental to Mac. Before she died, Jessie had managed to get a lot of information to Mac about Jacob\u2019s findings.

Move forward, of course.Jacob had managed to find an antiquated map believed to be drawn during the exploration of Hernando de Soto and his men in the sixteenth century. It pointed to a current place of Five Mile Island on the coast of Florida. In present day, the place just happens to be where a brand new resort is scheduled to be built. Big money and powerful companies do not welcome any hindrance to their profitmaking resort.This was an engrossing novel with many thrilling twists. However, I\u2019m a stickler for \u2018real\u2019 or plausible situations within fiction. Unless I missed it, there was no indicator of how Jacob had obtained the map. I know he\u2019s an archeologist, but a little more detail into how he managed to come upon a sixteenth century map would have more fully fleshed out part of this novel\u2019s plot. I did enjoy the characters, especially the banter between Mac and Kate. The dialogue was wonderful even by the secondary characters. This is the third in the Mac McClellan series.

Mac McClellan is up to his eye teeth in another \"tangled web we weave\" cast who keeps you guessing until the last page. Some of the familiar cast adds a familiar feel to his latest book, but it by no means an easy mystery to solve. When a single mom shows up dead hours after hiring Mac to prove her brother's suicide was murder. Mac quickly becomes hell-bend to prove how the siblings murders are connected. When Mac discovers the cast of suspects are all related through high school, the plot thickens. He soon discovers these teenage relationships turn into adult affairs of love and financial gain and loss. I am not one to write about spoilers, so you will have to believe me when I say this book will keep you guessing to the very end. Mac is in true form to personality and gumption as he navigates his way through the sordid details of this mystery.

Michael Helms. Private Detective Mac McClellan decides to continue his investigation after his client, Jessie, dies shortly after hiring him to investigate her brother\u2019s death. Jake was an archaeologist who unearthed artefacts and a coded map to an alleged camp of famed explorer, Hernando de Soto, and Jessie was convinced he was murdered.Mac learns that a construction company wants the site to build a resort and would do anything within their means to acquire it. The people who were close to the siblings also have ulterior motives for wanting them dead, and Mac hopes he can find the data Jake hid before the killers do. He knows they are ruthless enough to remove all obstacles in their way, including him.Deadly Dunes is a sleuth mystery with good action and suspense. The story is an interesting one that sees its main character and narrator, Mac, constantly forgetting his P.I. training and resorting to doing things in his own amateurish way. I think the dialogue is witty and I like Mac\u2019s dry sense of humour that seemed to irk some characters. The story catches one\u2019s attention with a beginning that made me curious to read on, as well as being amusing at times while Mac continues his sleuthing. E. Michael Helms writes well and I want to read other books from his Mac McClellan Mystery series, whose protagonist is compelling."}, {"userName": "Jessica Bronder", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5781282-jessica-bronder", "userReview": "An archaeologist, Jake has been found dead, the police rule it a suicide but his sister, Jessie knows better. Because he was looking for Hearnando de Soto had camped in the same area he was investigating, Jessie knows that it was murder. She calls Mac in to investigate. Mac discovers that a resort is planned on being built in the same area. There are a lot of suspects that seem to have something to gain from this resort. But when they decide to try and take out Mac, things get very personal.This is Mac\u2019s first official case as a private investigator. But this case is no so cut and dry. Because Jake had some mental health issues the suicide seems to be closer to the truth, but the more Mac digs the more it looks like someone is trying to hide something. Then they target him and things get really exciting. This is a great mystery. I didn\u2019t know who did it until the end because there are a lot of potential killers for many different reasons. There is a lot of action and you can\u2019t help but liking Mac. Mac is a true down home hero. I couldn\u2019t put this book down until the wee hours of the morning. I f you are looking for a great mystery full of thrills and chills I recommend you check out Deadly Dunes. As for me, I\u2019m going to find the first two books in the series and find out more about Mac.I received Deadly Dunes for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Bella's  Blog", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18314422-bella-s-blog", "userReview": "This was my first time reading anything by E.Michael Helms and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this great mystery story. This great story by E.Michael Helms was written with some suspense ,twists and turns that will shock you . The characters were amazing and I especially liked the banter between Mac and Kate. The secondary characters were also great and helped make this storyline flow smoothly. In Deadly Dune we have archaeologist who is die and his sister doesn't believe that it was suicide, because Jessie believes he was murder because her brother Jake had everything to live for and she knows that he wouldn't kill himself. Jake just had so much to live for at the moment like his job and the history that was waiting for him to discover. So Jessie needed a good hard working P.I. that she could trust .so she hires Mac McClellen ,who just happens to be a retired soldier. But not soon after hiring Mac ,poor Jessie is found die in an car accident. I'm not one for giving away spoilers ,so I must say this is one roller coaster ride that you don't want to miss out on.This great story by E.Michael Helms will draw you into it's pages and keep you there from start to finish ,and will have you on the edge of your seat until you find out why Jessie and Jake were killed. So I highly recommend that you read this amazing story,because you won't be disappointed"}, {"userName": "A.K.

He\u2019s written a fun, spunky mystery involving Mac McClellan, and I find myself crushing on him much like the overly spirited cop, Dakota. Mac is the token ex-marine turned P.I., equal parts gentleman and appropriate amounts of perve. Cunning, but not too lucky.I like that in this installment, Helms works in the fact that private investigators don\u2019t have the luxury of only working one case at a time if they want to get paid. Mac has to take time away from the big case everyone is grumbling about to an unseemly one that will cut him a check. As per the norm with Mac McClellan books, it was easy to get into, a breeze to read, and satisfying to finish.My only lament was due to my over excitement at the possibility of more archaeological tidbits. I love archaeology and was anticipating Mac going a little more Indiana Jones in this book than usual due to the nature of the big case. This is to no fault of Helms, who included what was appropriate for the story and the characters, merely a personal disappointment.As usual, I look forward to the next Mac McClellan book. He\u2019s a personal favorite of mine and made a great addition to my summer mystery binge reading.Be sure to follow E.

In comes Jessie convinced that her brother did not commit suicide but was murdered over some artifacts. Mac doesn't take her too seriously until she immediately dies in a car crash and the other artifacts she told him about disappear. Not a fan of coincidences, he pursues the case even though his mentor reminds him that his client is dead and obviously not paying the bills. He takes on Bonnie's case, but can't let Jessie's concerns go. He finds out about the plans for the resort and the lone hold out, who suddenly goes missing.The plot is well-developed as are the supporting characters. Mac doesn't always play by the rules in his investigation. Although a tough guy, he has a soft side. Those who enjoyed the first two in the series will not be disappointed. This can be read as a stand alone, but if this is your first Mac McClellan, you'll want to go back to the beginning of his story.

Michael Helms' Mac McClellan books have it all: great setting, wonderful characters, and a plot that will keep you guessing. The towns he describes along the Florida panhandle might very well be real, for all I know, and should I find one of them, I'm sure I'd spot any of the characters as I drove the streets. Helms has created a woven story that appears so full of gaps and loose ends it doesn't seem possible he could pull those threads tightly enough for a clear image to emerge. But he pulls it off. Everything makes sense, fits, and no loose ends are left dangling.I'll add this: while reading \"Deadly Dunes\" during the day, I was also finishing Michael Connelly's \"The Poet,\" before bed. Connelly's mystery also uses a \"suicide or not?\" element, so you'd think it would be easy to lose track of the characters or otherwise confuse the two books, but I was able to keep them straight. It says a lot when an author of a few books can keep up with a master like Connelly, but he did exactly that, delivering an intensely absorbing and satisfying mystery.Love live Mac McClellan!"}, {"userName": "Book Review Virginia Lee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52822360-book-review-virginia-lee", "userReview": "VIRGINIA REVIEW****************************************If you are looking of a great Mystery book, then this is the one for you.
