And you had to know a ghost when you saw one. -Wayson Choy, The Jade PeonyI don\u2019t often read immigrant narratives, and not because I don\u2019t think these stories are worth telling. But I have to confess to finding a certain predictable sameness in these accounts. I made an exception, however, for Wayson Choy\u2019s The Jade Peony, which was immediately recognized as an important book by critics upon its publication (in 1995). Widely enjoyed by readers, the novel remained on Canadian bestseller lists for months. The book is especially admired for its rich and its detailed evocation of a particular time and place in the history of Chinese Canadians: Vancouver\u2019s Chinatown during the 1930s. The experience of the Chen family, and their neighbors, is seen through the eyes of the family\u2019s three youngest children: only daughter Jook-Liang, adopted son Jung-Sum, and the sickly youngest son Sek-Lung. The novel recreates an especially complicated and difficult time for Chinese immigrants. In addition to the obvious economic hardships faced by the family, the Chen\u2019s are living in the shadow of the harsh laws enacted by the Canadian government to curtail Chinese immigration and to restrict the growth of their communities. As World War II looms, the residents of Chinatown watch uneasily as their Japanese neighbors become the victims of officially-sanctioned harassment and discrimination. Readers should also keep in mind that The Jade Peony is Choy\u2019s first published novel. Though beautifully written and peopled with memorable characters, I found the book to have a somewhat unfinished quality. The stories of the three siblings, in my opinion, failed to weave together in a truly satisfying conclusion. But The Jade Peony remains a beautiful, important book, deserving of its significance in recent Canadian literature."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "This one grew on me after I got used to its gentle, understated approach to coming-of-age issues in a Chinese immigrant family in Vancouver during in the 30\u2019s. We get a sensitive and universal exploration of the challenges of growing up combined with a fresh children\u2019s perspective on the conflicts between following traditions of their immigrant parents versus assimilation to Western culture in an urban multicultural society.As in Kingsolver\u2019s \u201cPoisonwood Bible\u201d, the novel uses the narrative approach of letting children deliver their overlapping stories in first person. The book\u2019s three sections cover segments of the lives of three children: a girl Liang, her older adoptive brother Jung, and her younger brother Sekky. The dominant character in their young lives is the elderly grandmother, who cares for them while the father and mother work. Despite the children\u2019s great respect for the traditional values of their grandmother, each moves in different ways toward success among their peers in the modern world. Liang dreams of becoming a tap dancer, Jung wants to become a boxer, and Sekky is inclined toward excellence in school. The fantasies and perceptions of each when they are young reveal wonderfully the struggles of kids to make sense of the adult world. Each has a different take on the grandmother\u2019s belief in superstitions and ghosts and each finds a way to come to terms with bullies and discrimination in the society and at school. The whole family is affected profoundly by the war between Japan and China in the late 30\u2019s and then by the onset of World War 2 at the end of the book. Like San Francisco, Vancouver had a large Japanese community which tragically came to be treated as enemies. As in The Hotel at the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, a doomed romance between a Chinese and a Japanese teenager figures in the story, in this case as a dramatic focus that caps off a novel with a broader and more subtle overall scope."}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "Set in Vancouver's Chinatown in the late 1930s and early 40s, The Jade Peony follows three children growing up in one family: Jook-Liang, the only sister; Jung-Sum, Second Brother and adopted; and Sek-Lung, Third Brother and sickly. This is a time when the Chinese who came to BC to work on the railway through the Rocky Mountains, paying the infamous Head Tax to do so, are the elders in the Chinatown society. Back home in China, the Japanese are steadily conquering land and reports of butchering and genocide create more than tension between the Chinese-Canadians and the Japanese-Canadians of Vancouver - exacerbated when the Japanese take Pearl Harbor and the Japanese-Canadians are rounded up and put into camps.Against this landscape of poverty, fear, racism and anxiety the three children relate a few years each, times of joy and sorrow and family conflict. Jook-Liang becomes best friends with an old Chinese man who worked on the railway, who has crippled legs and looks like a monkey - prompting five-year-old Liang to believe he is the Monkey King of legend. They go to movies together and she tap-dances like Shirley Temple to his applause. Jung learns to box and finds himself with a growing, unwanted attraction toward wildboy Frank, and Sekky insists he can see his dead grandmother, Poh-Poh, and becomes the only confidant of his neighbour's adopted daughter Meiying's secret liason with a Japanese boy.Written in the style of short stories, with grace, delicacy and a light touch, Choy opens up a period in Canada's history that the country is still ashamed of (only recently has the government committed to paying back the Chinese immigrants the illegal head tax), when people died because the white locals didn't rush to save them - they were \"resident aliens\", even if born here, and had almost no rights.The new generation of Chinese-Canadians are caught betwixt old China ways and westernised Canada ways, kept to tradition with the older generations belief in their ability to one day return to China, while their children want nothing more than to be Canadian. This is something that continues today, sometimes with seriously damaging side-effects as children are torn between family tradition and a very different lifestyle.I have to say, that I was won over from the beginning by Liang's absorption with the Monkey King. I grew up watching Monkey, with Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy, Horse and the beautiful priest Tripitaka (played by a woman, hence all the sexual tension between \"him\" and Monkey - yeah, we all wanted them to get it on ;), it was one of my favourite shows, and it was such a delight to find reference to the legend behind it here in this book.The light and graceful quality of the prose, as well as moments of irony and humour, balanced out the darker undertones of the novel, including the sad ending. The setting and period felt very real, and it was great to be given the chance to understand and sympathise with a specific community like this, with all their flaws and faults, their generosity and acts of kindness, their determination and what drives them. It's also a great story, a slice of Canada's history opened-up, though I did struggle to keep up with the back-and-forth narrative, the non-linear timeline, which sometimes confused me."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "Chinatown of the 1940's in Vancouver, three children of Chinese immigrant parents nurture dreams of making their own mark on the world around them.

It makes me wonder how I would deal with the langugage barrier, the differences in culture and tradition, observing and obeying the laws of the land and that of a society very different from the one I came from. But Wayson Choy makes my imagination come alive in this novel with well-written and carefully chosen words that make you feel a part of the story. I felt like I'd been transplanted back to 1940 Vacouver and could almost hear, see and smell the time of that era.While the new family is trying to engraciate themselves into this new and modern life in Vancouver, their Grandmother Poh-Poh who lives with them, is stuck in her past in a country where she came to believe that the old ways, the world of ghosts, omens and superstition, and the ancient lore and sometimes complicated remedies for illness are the only way to live. When reading this novel we have to remember that this family's story plays out during the the war which also brings more uncertainty and distrust to the newly arrived family. How do they recognize friends from enemies? How do they maintain their old ways and the culture of their homeland while trying to fit in and live peacefully in this new country? The children, as the younger generation, wants to forget about the old ways and welcome and embrace their new world with open arms, but the older generation is set in their ways and afraid to turn their back on the traditions and beliefs they were raised with.\"The Jade Peony\" is a moving story of memory and loss, hardship and heartbreak, of reconciling the past with the future and is achingly real."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1798222-shane", "userReview": "Being an immigrant myself, who came to Canada in the '80's, I was interested in reading this book from a personal perspective. Choy paints a rather grim picture of Chinese immigrants in Canada in the 1930's: bachelor-men unable to bring their families across, deaths in labour camps built to construct the Canadian railway \"from sea to shining sea\", \"resident alien\" status with no hope of ultimate citizenship, second-class treatment during medical emergencies, immigrants relegated to ghettos (or Chinatowns - perhaps the segregation of immigrants is the genesis for a Chinatown and not the notion that Chinese like to hang out together).And yet by the 1980's, the mood for immigration was much more open and tolerant, and the new Chinese have enjoyed much success in this country. I am glad that Choy captured this moment in time to remind us how far we have progressed as a nation.The perspective of a child is always a clever device to employ, especially when the adult world is the focus. This view distorts our adult imperfections, it sees beauty behind physical infirmities (as in the case of seven-year old First Sister Jook Leong's attachment to the deformed Monkey King), it does not comprehend illogical adult actions (eight-year old Sek Lung's struggle to understand the secret adult whispers and the tragic result of Meying's romance with the taboo Japanese boy Kaz), and it fears the budding appetites in their emerging adult bodies (Second Brother Jung Sum's fearful discovery of his attraction to Frank, the young boxer, in the heat of a fight).We also see the impact of war on the young: First Brother Kiam wants to join the Canadian army even though he does not qualify as a resident alien; Sek Lung practises war games with his toys and is an expert on military strategy; and Japanese immigrant kids are suddenly considered \"the enemy\". Only Miss Doyle, the school teacher, treats all her students equally, perhaps a symbol of the Canada to come, even though she exerts military discipline in class, and reads aloud the letters of her dead brother who was blown up while trying to save lives. Also brought into sharp focus is the superstition and cruelty of the old world that is never quite left behind. Grandma Poh Poh was an abused child, is unable to display affection, openly proclaiming that girls are \"nothing\", until Third Brother Sek Lung (he with the sick lungs - a play of words here?) is born and becomes her \u201cbaby\u201d; the bed-wetting Jung Sum discovers his birth mother murdered by his father in Kamloops, and finds his sensuality awakened only when he gets a beating at the hands of his mentor Frank; the ghosts that are supposed to roam the neighbourhood in China also inhabit Sek Lung when he sees his dead grandmother during various \"incidents\". And yet the children want to be Canadian while their parents tread the half-and half world of the immigrant and grandma Poh-Poh will always be Chinese.There is some predictability in the end, especially as this book is set in Vancouver. We Canadian's are unable to escape the collective guilt for incarcerating our Japanese immigrant community during the war, and much has been written on this subject. And sure enough, Choy zeroes on this event for his climax, in an otherwise episodic book. The interesting twist is that \"the Japanese incident\" is viewed from a Chinese perspective and, for a change, the Chinese, the Canadians and the Americans are allies, for they had all been invaded by \"those Japs\". The children seem to understand this part of adult logic, which frightens me, and makes me wonder if we adult Canadians were behaving like kids during the Japanese incarceration? Was this Choy's ultimate message that seems to get lost amidst all the other mini stories that make up this very easily readable and fluidly written book?"}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6468374-anita", "userReview": "\u201cLyrical and moving\u201d the opening words of the blurb for this book and I don\u2019t think I can say it much better. This is one of those all too rare novels that truly transports you to another time and place, immerses you into a culture and a life experience that is far from your own. So much so that finishing it is rather a rude awakening.The story is set in immigrant Vancouver, Chinatown in the 1940\u2019s. In the family home of three generations of a Chinese family, we meet the matriarchal grandmother, the worried and put upon parents and the children, through the eyes of whom the story is told. Three of the children tell their tales in the three different sections of the book as they try to cope with growing up as Chinese and Canadian, being of the old world and the new, being both and yet neither. The first to narrate is Liang the only daughter who struggles with her dreams of fame and film stardom alongside the loss of a childhood friend, mentor and hero. Overshadowing her life is the constant reminder by her grandmother that she is -as a girl child, useless to her family. Jung the second to speak, the adopted second son of the family trains to be a boxer whilst repressing memories of his first family and trying to live up to his elder brother\u2019s example whilst coming to terms with his extremes of otherness. Sek- Lung is the last to speak and perhaps the most moving. The youngest son and a weakling from birth, he documents the worlds decent into war and his palpable urge to be a part of the fighting. He plays his war games with unceasing resolve as his parents worry and cry over the fate of their people half the world away and try to stop their eldest son from joining the fight. Sek \u2013Lung lives in a simple world of school and play, where people fit neatly into the roles of good guys and bad, friends and enemies until he witnesses a beloved family friend and babysitter fraternising with the \u2018enemy\u2019 a Japanese boy. His boundaries blur as he gets to know the person beneath the appearance and tries to make sense of his newfound knowledge whilst protecting his friend. The novel raises many issues of otherness, of third generation immigrants who are yet expected to adhere to the rules and superstitions of a land they\u2019ve never been to, of neighbours who must hate and ignore each other, of the pressures we put on our children. It\u2019s a thought provoking beautifully written novel."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3830652-sara", "userReview": "Much to my delight, I was randomly assigned to read and defend Wayson Choy\u2019s The Jade Peony for a local Canada Reads gathering. It was meant to be: I had Wayson sign a copy of his 1995 novel for me just a few months ago when he was in Halifax for a reading of his most recent work, Not Yet: A Memoir of Living and Almost Dying, and The Jade Peony has for many years been high on my favourite books list.The Jade Peony so eloquently combines the familiar with the unfamiliar. The universal themes of coming of age, forbidden love, sexuality, racism, death and jealousy intertwined with the mysteries of Vancouver\u2019s Chinatown, the disgrace of being a girl-child, the hardships endured by the first Chinese immigrants, and the loss and suffering as a result of Canadian immigration policies of late 19th and early 20th centuries.The book\u2019s appeal is certainly in part due to the story being told through the eyes of children. The three young narrators straddle two worlds, old vs. new, east vs. west, and through their eyes we glimpse into the world of their Chinese born elders, filled with worry, secrets, symbols, ghosts, and magic, intertwined with a child\u2019s world of Eaton\u2019s dollhouses, Shirley Temple, Joe Louis and Tarzan. They are an \u201cin-between\u201d generation, sheltered in their Chinatown neighborhood, but with glimpses of life beyond their community boundaries.This story centres around family. This is a somewhat cobbled together family, with a servant who is elevated to stepmother status (even to her own blood children, however), an adopted second brother, a Chinese-born first brother, two Canadian-born siblings, the family\u2019s father and, most importantly, sharp-tongued Poh-Poh, the grandmotherly glue that binds everyone together. Nevertheless, it is a family, and in the inscription in my copy of The Jade Peony Wayson wrote \u201cFor Sara: Family is who loves you.\u201dIf this novel isn't on every Canadian high school reading list, it ought to be.

Really interesting cultural study, with great detail!The first, and shortest, section with Liang is my favourite, the last one with Kiam was my second-favourite. I didn't like the Jung stories much.I still wonder why did he leave out first brother Kiam? At first I thought it was because he was going to die, which he didn't. Second, I thought it was because the children show the difference between Canadian-Chinatown life vs. Poh-Poh's Old China life, and Kiam was very traditional so he wouldn't show the contrast. However, by the end of the book he is countering his parents, showing them science vs. old herbal remedies.

Wayson Choy (yay Canadian author!) tells the story of an immigrant Chinese family who come to Vancouver in the 1930s, as the conflict between Japan and China in the East, and Canada, Britain, et al and Germany in the West heats up. I loved this book for many reasons. First and foremost, Choy writes stunningly. His prose is lyrical and the stories that he tells are deeply moving. The family's story is told through the perspectives of three of the children, and each one is touching in a different way. I began this book while sitting at the Vancouver airport, so it was fun to read a book set in the same city, decades earlier. This was one of my book club's book selections, and I'm pleased to say that almost everyone seemed to feel as positively about the book as I did. Bottom line - read it.

I liked it but I didn't love it. I do think it's an interesting read though and I would recommend it to almost anyone.The writing is lovely and I really enjoyed seeing some major Canadian historical events through the eyes of Chinese immigrants - railroad construction and the creation of Canada, changing policies around immigration, the Depression in the 30's, and the First World War in the 40's. The way the story flowed between events in Vancouver and the traditions and stories of Old China was great. The depiction of the immigrant experience and the differences in identity between those who immigrated and the next generations born in the new country was engaging and realistic - I think that the story really did justice to the push and pull of identity and the conflict that people feel between maintaining one's heritage and trying to fit in with the dominant society.Wayson Choy breaks the book into 3 sections, each narrated by a different child in the family - Jook-Liang (only sister), Jung-Sum (second brother), and Sek-Lung (third brother). I liked each of the children and appreciated the opportunity to see the family through their eyes, but it was difficult to make the transition from story to story. I would just really start getting into one of the narrators' perspectives and feeling the story start to flow...and then it would end. I found that a difficult aspect of this book because I ended up having to almost start from scratch at the beginning of each new narrative section. Each child's story also ends with loss and, even though loss is a standard part of a coming-of-age story, I found it difficult experiencing it three times in one book.Ultimately, although it took me awhile to see it, I think the story does have a narrative arc centered around the family changing, particularly in regards to the women in the family. At the beginning of the book, Step-Mother has a subservient and almost inconsequential role while Poh-Poh (the grandmother) is the head of the house-hold. But by the end of the book Step-Mother becomes Mother and assumes the central female role in the house-hold. I particularly liked how Wayson Choy used the jade peony as a symbol for this transformation, as well as using the jade peony throughout the narrative as a means of cohesively linking together the Old China and Vancouver Chinatown experiences."}, {"userName": "Monika", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44655884-monika", "userReview": "I'm a sucker for happy endings and for stories that have a sense of finality to them.

I found the three POVs unique and insightful and although some might not enjoy the ambiguous endings I think that that is the beauty of a story that continues to live on inside your mind once you've finished the book. There's a lot of tug-of-war going on inside the book; old and new, Chinese and Canadian, good guys and bad guys, war and peace, truth and lies... and the answer that came up over and over again was that things are rarely as black or white as it might seem.

The story is told through the perspective of three of the four children of that family \u2013 Jook-Liang, the only sister who curses the fact that she is regarded as useless because she is a girl and aspires to be an actress; Jung-Sum, the adopted brother who wants to be a professional boxer and struggles with his sexuality; Sek-Lung, the youngest brother, who witnesses his babysitter having a relationship with a Japanese boy during the start of the Second World War.I thought it was very interesting in how Choy provided the reader with an accurate view of how the life of the Chinese immigrants in Vancouver went in those years. It was a tough life in which the immigrants had to deal with economic hardships, discrimination (casually on the streets but also through actual Canadian laws), and eventually a World War in which their Japanese immigrant neighbours would soon become their enemies. And then there\u2019s also the clash of family elders trying to preserve their culture while their children and grandchildren are becoming more and more accepting of the Canadian ways. Telling the story through three different first person perspectives was a good move, too \u2013 it feels like you get to know the three siblings wholly, faults and flaws and good traits all rolled into one. One presence is felt strongly throughout the entire book, though the three children all view her differently: Poh-Poh, their traditional grandmother, who keeps the Chinese beliefs, traditions, and ghost stories alive. It is her pink jade pendant that the title refers to.It was a pity that the story of the eldest brother, Kiam-Kim, the son of the father\u2019s first wife and the only one to have been born in China, was missing. It might have made for a more complete book and served as a conclusion to the siblings\u2019 stories, but I later found out that Choy has dedicated an entire book to Kiam-Kim\u2019s life story,  All That Matters, but I haven\u2019t read it yet.Choy\u2019s prose and choice of words is adequate to the story, nothing especially noteworthy but the subtleness of it fits the story he wants to tell \u2013 a glimpse into the life, nothing more, nothing less. Something to stress the importance and relevancy of what the Chinese immigrants in Canada went through, which is often enough overlooked in history. His characters are memorable, but something was missing from the book that really tied the three siblings\u2019 stories together, save for the presence of their grandmother. Each of their stories ended abruptly, and there was no thread to link them all. It felt unfinished and not as complete as it could have been; even so, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride.Recommended for those who enjoy stories about exploring characters first and foremost, and people looking for an accurate and humbling account of the life of Chinese immigrants in the 30s and 40s in Vancouver, Canada."}, {"userName": "yiming", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9650480-yiming", "userReview": "This book was heartbreaking and beautiful. It explores the complex family dynamics of an immigrant Chinese family in Vancouver. It's fascinating to think about how a lot of Chinese families in North America were actually \"blended families\" before that was a term. Due to the difficulties Chinese people had in immigrating to North America bc of anti-Asian sentiment, many people were \"paper sons\"--related to their sponsoring family only by thin lies and forged paperwork. The book is broken up into three parts--each told from the point of view of a different character. I really loved the first part, told by Jook-Liang, the only sister in the family. I loved her relationship with Wong Suk, a family friend, who is an older man. She thinks he is the Monkey King. Their friendship is very touching and sweet. The second part is about adopted second brother Jung-Sum. His story was really heartbreaking, as he struggles to understand and reconcile both his sexuality and his traumatic childhood. Toxic masculinity really come thru in the second and third parts of the book. It was scary to read third brother Sekky's story and realized how obsessed he is with violence and war.

Told from the perspective of the family's children, it paints a narrow, focused picture of Vancouver in the 1930s. It's sad, funny, and at times even horrifying, and it gives the reader a good sense of Chinese culture, family life and pragmatism. The end of the book, which deals with the racial tensions between the Japanese Canadians and pretty much everyone else but *especially* the Chinese, is heartbreaking, and ends abruptly - quite appropriately, in retrospect, as I think the author was trying to evoke the abrupt end of childhood for the kids - but it was jarring for me. It's not like there were any real loose ends, just a sense of \"wow, way to end on a downer.\" But still, a really good book, and a great glimpse into a culture that many of us think of as merely a subset of our larger heterogenous Canadian identity."}, {"userName": "Monty", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/285761-monty", "userReview": "There is much to say for this book about a family of Chinese immigrants living in pre-WWII Vancouver, BC.

Anti-Japanese sentiment comes in loud and clear in the last part of the book because of the Japanese invasion of China and mistrust of the Japanese living in Vancouver (though I think that there is a much longer history of discord between Japan and China). I must say that it was difficult for me to get into the book at first, and I almost stopped reading it. I am glad I kept with the book because I felt much satisfaction in finishing it. If you read this book, don't read the end until you get to it--if you have a sentimental side, reading it early will take away the emotional impact of the last page, which has the only closure to speak of in the entire, complicated story."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/844947-cindy", "userReview": "I don't usually force myself to finish books, but I'm glad that I did in this case. The first half was sooo slow; nothing happened and the characters were just meh, although I did enjoy the Chinese words thrown in every now and then. I would read the words, hear them being said aloud in my head and then, ah yes, that glimmer of recognition. I know what this means! Yes... so obviously not everybody will have the same experience reading this (I like this aspect in Amy Tan's books too). The second half was far better and made me (almost) want to go back and re-read the first half to see if I would enjoy it more after having learned what I learned in the second.

It renders a complex and complete human world, which by the end we have learned to love.\"\u2014 The Boston Book ReviewChinatown, Vancouver, in the late 1930s and '40s provides the backdrop for this poignant first novel, told through the vivid reminiscences of the three younger children of an immigrant Chinese family. The siblings grapple with their individual identities in a changing world, wresting autonomy from the strictures of history, family, and poverty. Sister Jook-Liang dreams of becoming Shirley Temple and escaping the rigid, old ways of China. Adopted Second Brother Jung-Sum, struggling with his sexuality and the trauma of his childhood in China, finds his way through boxing. Third Brother Sekky, who never feels comfortable with the multitude of Chinese dialects swirling around him, becomes obsessed with war games, and learns a devastating lesson about what war really means when his 17-year-old babysitter dates a Japanese man.Mingling with life in Canada and the horror of war are the magic, ghosts, and family secrets of Poh-Poh, or Grandmother, who is the heart and pillar of the family. Side by side, her three grandchildren survive hardships and heartbreaks with grit and humor. Like the jade peony of the title, Choy's storytelling is at once delicate, powerful, and lovely.The Jade Peony was selected by the Literary Review of Canada as one of the \"100 Most Important Books in Canadian History\" in 2005. It was also an American Library Association Notable Book of the Year in 1998, and was winner of the 1995 Trillium Award (shared with Margaret Atwood).", "title": "The Jade Peony", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259562.The_Jade_Peony", "average": 3.71, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320473789l/259562.jpg", "reviews": 243, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/151703.Wayson_Choy", "name": "Wayson Choy"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259562.The_Jade_Peony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1399944.The_Jade_Peony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13050214-de-pioenroos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/614168.All_That_Matters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/614169.Paper_Shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3247564-not-yet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40117624-de-pioenroos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1472425.Food_That_Really_Schmecks"]}
