The pale young girl at the register might have been attractive but for her paper uniform which seemed to be cutting into her scalp and squeezing her forehead into her thick black eyebrows- she bore a look of impatience and the beginnings of sweat and possibly menstrual discomfort. The Smucker\u2019s\u00ae Uncrustables\u00ae was requested by the SPIRIT-OF-JETER (it always strikes me as odd that adult heterosexual men wear sports jerseys emblazoned with another, usually more virile and successful, man\u2019s name, as if attempting subterfuge, to crawl into that other man\u2019s skin, to show alliance and affinity with this man, whom they will never meet; it is a very sexual gesture; if the same men were to be discovered rifling through Derek Jeter\u2019s dresser and donning his briefs they would hardly be met with the same public acceptance); and there was a quick moment of exchange-tension; as JETER-beguiler rifled the change in his pockets the pale register attendee shuffled uncomfortably, consulted an empty bin in the smudged display case beside her, adjusted her paper cap, knitted her suffering brow, and confessed \u201cwe\u2019re out\u201d. I thought for a moment of DEREK JETER number .2. of the \nNEW YORK YANKEES\n being picked off first base by a quick throw from the ready stance of some nimble AL East lefty and the glee that would resound like church bells amongst us UNDERDOGS; \u201cYer OUT!\u201d; (okay, here\u2019s as good a place as any to explain the basics of what a Smucker\u2019s\u00ae Uncrustables\u00ae exactly is- it is a pre-made peanut butter and jelly sandwich product, and its \u201chook\u201d is that it comes with the crust ALREADY CUT OFF(!)- therefore, labor of consumer is reduced to a bare minimum [at most straining at a vacuum-sealed package with clenched fingers and then the effort of lifting sandwich to mouth, and I suppose whatever calories are expended in chewing, swallowing, and eventual defecation]- but I\u2019ll let Smucker\u2019s\u00ae do the talking: \u201cSmucker\u2019s\u00ae has discovered a new way to seal homemade goodness into a peanut butter and jelly sandwich\u2026 without the crust! Uncrustables\u00ae are the perfect \"grab-and-go\" sandwich for families on the move. Simply keep them in the freezer, then pack them in your lunch in the morning. By lunchtime, Uncrustables\u00ae are thawed and ready to eat.\u201d- You can imagine the convenience, especially for the beleaguered and hounded father on vacation, herding about his clattering, bucktoothed brood and sexless wife from sight to sight, waiting for geysers to spew with mockery [for when was the last time plump wifey made him gush like that?], watching the bison migrate avec les infants over a desolate plain with a dim glimmer of doomed recognition, perhaps unconsciously wishing for the saving grace of a grizzly bear\u2019s jaws that might rip and rent him free from these worldly bonds, only wanting for the respite and ease of a crustless, ready-to-devour peanut butter and jelly sandwich [like Mom used to make, she also used to cut off the crusts- Smucker\u2019s\u00ae marketing team would have been mightily proud had they come to know, through whatever strange circumlocutions or persistent surveillance, that JETER-avatar had come to associate Uncrustables\u00ae with a primeval Mother-Figure], and perhaps a Coca-Cola\u00ae to slide down his gullet [the sun really beats down at these altitudes!] and a moment, just a moment, of precious silence as he gawps and chews and waits on an oak bench surrounded by Cowboy Culture for Ol\u2019 Faithful to orgasm and the inevitable post-coital drowsiness of the crowds of tourists wandering off nonplussed and vexed and bit moistened from spray [the girls untousle their hair with a blush], back into the womb of their tourist buses, not sure where their money went...) Jeter-impostor reels on his heels for but a second. The queue babbles like a noisy little mountain brook. The cheeseburgers audibly steam. Someone in the recesses guffaws. I smell ointment. \u201cWell... hell!...\u201d murmurs Derek Jeter\u2019s real-world counterpart. And a few meters beneath my feet I feel the slight thermal dynamic tremor of this populace earth falling into a symbolic, latent, pre-reproductive anticipation.And so but what I find really interesting about You Bright And Risen Angels is that I think this, Vollmann\u2019s first novel- a big fucking messy ball of electric prose, shooting out arcs like a Tesla coil charged with imaginative pulsing WORDS, rampaging all over the place from Mars to the Arctic to the Amazon jungle to San Francisco to a boy\u2019s summer camp within a single blown-the-fuck-out sentence- that this is the book that has definitely convinced me of Vollmann\u2019s genius; that is, from a very young age this man was charged with a peerless intellect and imagination (it was published when he was 27). In its eclectic, schizo-ball of twining ideas, vaults of imagination, fuck-all sci-fi bizarreness, insect-amphetamine-buzz, one can find in utero the seeds of what were to become Vollmann\u2019s preoccupations par excellence- the phenomena of power structures, especially those enacting violence and oppression on weaker subjects; the many-headed Hydra of societal violence; the darkest sides of colonialism and decadent capitalism/imperialism; the attempt at resurrecting the dignity and value of the cast-offs and cast-outs and pariahs of humanity (...hell, we could just say Civilization and Its Discontents); how economics shapes the world; the idea of revolution through literature; the intensely impressionistic sentences, flowing from a mind both taut to the extreme and hallucinatorily vibrating and discursive. The essences of Vollmann are here, present, fully birthed if a bit raw and unrefined- a prophecy of things to come- a harbinger of very good news. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned how FUN and what a piece of ENTERTAINMENT this is! Oh my. Vollmann\u2019s glorious, chaotic, undeniably funny and darkly intense first foray into the vibrating and humming beehive of LETTERS! Huzzah."}, {"userName": "Nick Craske", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5484622-nick-craske", "userReview": "William T. Vollmann's 1987 debut You Bright And Risen Angels is a sprawling disorderly book. Strained to breaking point, it contracts and collapses in on its own raw energy, with exuberant force. It's a beautiful mess, a cacophony of digressions, and a picaresque allegorical Heart of Darkness.I've always had a perversion for peculiar oddities and productions, such as the shambolic genius of Syd Barrett's solo debut, the Madcap Laughs. I'm drawn to the imperfect artefacts which acquire a rare artistry and originality through their flaws. These originals reframe their counterparts, their genres and their mediums.For this book is such a thing'um. A dense, compulsively elaborate, silly, obscene, funny, tragic, philosophical, poetic, inspired, horrific and comedic cartoon blast of post-modern tale-telling. Was it programmed this way? There are bugs in the system\u2026You Bright And Risen Angels is narrated by 'the author' a programmer, creating a system and writing the story into being. The electrical current surges into the characters: our hero, Bug, the omnipotent Mr. White and his dubious assistant Dr. Dodger; the narcissistic Wayne and the plant like Parker, double agent Frank and scary Big George\u2026 The Caterpillar Heart, The Electric Gang and many more who are brought brightly into existence in our imaginations: 'I press the resurrection button and you will be larger than life'.This magnificent electrified-insectifide necropolis is inhabited with warring factions. A smorgasbord of weird humans and rebellious insects led by The Great Beetle, leader of Bugdom and, last but not least the Blue Globes of Electricity. Spectral-electrical sphere manifestations which will give thee the heebie-jeebies. I promise thee.There is a plot. There is. This beastly tome is plotted and the energy and gusto of the writing propel one through it. Vollmann's compulsive elaboration takes the writing through plots and counterplots and symbols that twist and convulse with electricity. It's a teetering structure of Post Modern stylings. It's more confusing than my review. It's gloriously comic and absurdly moving. The Insect genocide broke my heart. I was surprised to discover WTV hadn't read Gravity's Rainbow prior to writing this book. You Bright And Risen Angels is less esthetic and narcissistic than Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow but as a black comedy, rife with digressions and a sprawling cast of madcap laughing oddities, it's extremely similar. I held off writing a review before experiencing the first of WTV's Seven Dream Series, The Ice Shirt, so I could gain a sense of how WTV writing has evolved. For this debut thing'um is exciting in its potential; in pointing to something great. I believe this is for Vollmann completists. An early demo; bootlegs, raw data and program prototypes of a bigger more sophisticated and elegant system."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "Left-Wing Opportunism: An Infantile DisorderMuch commentary (there's so little real criticism) about this novel attempts to excuse its manifold flaws on the basis that it was the product of an inexperienced 27 year old writer.This is the tenth book by Vollmann that I\u2019ve read. Ironically, I didn\u2019t find it much worse (or better) than any of his subsequent works. There\u2019s definitely no need to justify it as juvenilia, even if it is infantile. Most of the flaws are deliberate stylistic choices (whether adventurous or not), almost all of which are repeated in his later works.Instinctive Data, Research and ReportageOne of the stylistic tics that pays less and less dividends the more you\u2019re exposed to it is the excessive reliance on research and reportage to ground the fiction. Too often, there just isn\u2019t enough imagination or fiction to lift the work out of the quagmire of the mundane or pedestrian prose. He just deluges us with barely relevant or interesting detail. This criticism probably applies more to Vollmann\u2019s later works. Here, he was supposedly inspired by the Russian Revolution, so we\u2019re served up analogies with the careers of both Lenin and Trotsky. Vollmann has implied that he lacked the courage and skill to confront these figures head-on, so he disguised them in the form of fictional analogues. As a result, he couldn\u2019t be criticised for not getting his portraits right. Instead, he just doesn\u2019t paint these portraits convincingly enough. The characters have neither real nor fictional merits. Most of them are flimsy and transparent. Did I mention unconvincing?Revolution and ReactionAt the most basic level, the novel concerns the relationship between revolution and reaction or resistance.The status quo is represented by the White Power and Light Company, which generates electricity. The reactionary forces are associated with power or the state. Their supporters are largely business people, petty bourgeois salesmen and Republican politicians and supporters who benefit financially and personally from the status quo.The revolutionaries are a coalition of people and other beings and forces. In a nod to science fiction, one of the major forces is the entire world population of insects and bugs. Rarely does Vollmann give us any indication of the size of the bugs, so it\u2019s difficult to appreciate the physical threat of the bugs to their human enemies. Also, few of the bugs have a speaking role, so you can\u2019t form an affinity with any individual bug (even their leader, the Great Beetle). They are just a swarming, amorphous mass of bugs.Young Solitary Idealist BugPerhaps this is why the most prominent revolutionary (the Lenin analogue? or is it Trotsky?) is a human male called (our hero) Bug. Again, we don\u2019t learn much about what makes him tick, he doesn\u2019t talk much, we\u2019re just told bits and pieces about his back story or personality from time to time. What we do learn isn\u2019t particularly encouraging or inspiring. Like \u201cI, the author\u201d, he\u2019s a nonconformist and a loner, and has trouble forming and maintaining relationships with the opposite sex (he needs to get out more - from between the covers [of books] or from in front of his screen):\u201c...at the time of which we are speaking he was still just a young solitary Bug taking observations and gathering instinctive data without much to guide him save a certain steely reflexiveness which would prove itself within a fistful of pages.\u201d\u201cAll of his young life, as we know, Bug had been infected by a spasmodic political deviation from his peers...\u201d\u201cBug was generally considered to be nothing but a trouble-maker...and they let him spend hours and hours at the library.\u201dThe Glory of Triumphant BeetlesIt\u2019s mutually beneficial that the bugs recruit Bug:\u201cThe essentials of the offer were that Bug would be expected to work for the insect cause and obey instructions, in return for which he would be treated as a star operative, his enemies would be undermined gratis, and he would someday share in the glory of triumphant beetles, moths, millipedes and waxworms. Obviously, Bug, who remained to the end of his life a solitary idealist, held a secret part of himself aside\u2026\u201d\u201cSo he [Bug] sat there, once passive, now passive-aggressive, eventually to become aggressive wholly as he killed and thereby became one with the rest of the world.\"There\u2019s no explanation of the bond between Bug and the bugs. Vollmann refers to Bug\u2019s ideology a few times, but we never learn exactly what it is. By analogy with the other revolutionaries, we have to assume that he is left-wing, radical and working class (as opposed to liberal, conformist and middle class).Killing FieldsWhatever the difference is, it\u2019s supposed to be worth targeting and murdering large numbers of both adults and children (in other words, whole families) for.Susan, equally oblivious to Bug\u2019s ideology, follows, almost blindly, in Bug\u2019s footsteps:\u201cSusan, not knowing his motives, surrendered herself to his ideology and decided to kill people.\u201dMany readers highlight Vollmann\u2019s empathy for non-conformist characters (i.e., who are, after all, just figments of his imagination or research). However, rarely do they recognise the flipside that he shows no understanding of or empathy with the liberal left or hard-working middle (or working) class people (and their families).So, we readers are supposed to sympathise with this unexplained, and potentially unjustified, revolutionary violence, as if it\u2019s enough to bond over the same Che Guevara t-shirt.This revolution is no uprising or rising up. It's just killing for the sake of killing or fiction/entertainment/stimulation. Cancelled Out By EquivocationThis dilemma is reflected in (and perpetrated by) the structure of the narrative itself. Vollmann utilises at least two different narrators: one, described as \u201cI, the author\u201d himself (the good guy) and the other, Big George (the bad guy): \"This is a bookish novel because I, the author, know little of life, and I, Big George, will reveal no secrets.\" The author has created the framework of the novel in a computer program at work, while Big George (the ghost in the machine) undermines it as the author sleeps at night, by challenging and changing the fate of the protagonists. Eventually, he intends to kill off Bug and his fellow travellers and revolutionaries. We have to assume that Big George prevails. What we read is only one-half of the abstract conception of the novel. The contents pages reveal details of the chapters that were either written but not published, or were not written at all. Big George tells us in the body of the novel that he will kill off Bug in the second volume (which we never see). We are just left with the foreshadowed knowledge or suspicion that the revolution inevitably fails (as if all revolutions must necessarily fail [e.g., because they\u2019re betrayed, in and by the embrace of power]):\u201c...it was beautiful but also horribly sad because the book was only half over and you knew that bad things were going to happen.\u201dThis made me suspect that Vollmann and his revolutionary protagonists were really pretty equivocal about the need for revolutions (they\u2019re like a hipster version of F. A. Hayek's anti-revolutionary diagnosis in \"The Road to Serfdom\"), and that the entire novel is just a passivist ruse, an opportunity for the deskbound reader/writer to hang out with the other side (a bunch of transgressives) and share their pain. It occasionally threatens to become an early attempt to create or investigate a moral calculus of revolutionary violence before his 3,300 page non-fiction project, \n\u201cRising Up and Rising Down\u201d.\n However, what is totally lacking is any evidence or argument for a just cause. Surely there is more to the revolution than exhilaration:\u201cHe loved riding in open vehicles with the wind in his face.\u201dSerious Young InsectsEven the empathy is bogus (apart, perhaps, for the anomalous appearance of Ken and Brandi doll in the last pages):\u201cThe Secret Ambassador of the Bugs...made our hero feel sorry for it, in the easy way that we all have of pitying vulnerability when that pity costs us nothing.\u201d\u201cO college days!...even though he didn't know what they were doing it for he couldn't help but love and admire them.\u201dIn a nod to the origin of Stalin\u2019s nickname, Vollmann says of Bug:\u201cHe had now become completely steeled. Thanks to all that he had suffered at summer camp, he was incapable of the softer human feelings without considerable effort...And yet this is not to say that he did not love. For it is possible to love an insect if you want to badly enough and it is also serious about you.\u201dTo be honest, there is far greater insight into radicalism and revolutionary violence in the novels of China Mieville.Bah Humbug!No wonder Vollmann described this fiction as a \u201ccartoon\u201d - it\u2019s little more than a vehicle for bookish nerds to identify with illusory superheroes of the pseudo-radical kind. The bright and risen angels end up (like they started), after all is said and done, dull and fallen (they're \"made to kill each other, and fall and die.\"). As one of the protagonists says:\u201cI think you're all a bunch of sick puppies.\u201dThe reader is left puzzled, disappointed, nay, bewildered by the wasted effort and an overwhelming sense of lost opportunity. To paraphrase Bob Dylan:\u201cIt ain't no use to wonder why, BugIf'n you don't know by now, It ain't no use in turning on your light, Bug -The light I never knowedI'm on the dark side of the roadWhy'd you hafta empty your loadYou're the reason I'm travellin\u2019 onYou just kinda wasted my precious time.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "Enigmatic and mysterious wars are known since the ancient times \u2013 take, for example, Batrachomyomachia also known as the  Battle of the Frogs and Mice.

The Conglomeraship was intended to look as if it had been assembled from the, salvaged, derelict scraps of other ships. It was purposefully ugly, bulky, and crude. And ever since then, I've had a passion for things that are not so much flawed but constructed out of flaws. Flaws are only bad in something that aspires to perfection. The Millennium Falcon is a \"hunk of junk\", but c'mon, that's the point!William T. Vollmann's first novel is- Immature- Pretentious - Gratuitous- Self-indulgent- Ridiculous- Poorly paced- Out of controlit happens to also be - Wildly entertaining- Heart-breaking- Hilarious - GeniusPut simply, \"You Bright and Risen Angels\" is about growing up in small town America. It's a coming of age novel. It's probably the only coming of age novel to feature an insect war, but it's also written by William Vollmann, so nothing is certain here. Vollmann's genius is to anchor the battle between insects and electricity in events at summer camps, schools, colleges, first jobs, break ups and make ups, bullying, hitchhiking, and all the other staples of growing up in the suburbs of America. Vollmann manages to explore the lives of kids in high-school through the lens of spies, troop-movements, and battles. It's a hilarious take on the heroic task of becoming (or failing to become), an adult in the weird world of America.But that's only one layer of the twisted puzzle of \"You Bright and Risen Angels\". The book has two narrators: I, the author, and I, Big George. Both battle for the fate of the characters. Warring narrators were reprised by Vollmann in his later masterpiece, \"Europe Central\". Set next to the artful maturity of \"Europe Central\", this book seems even more raw and abrasive, constantly over the top, an explosion of prose and possibility, as more layers begin to pile up.Are the bugs and electricity just metaphorical representations of a computer game? Is the narrator imagining the whole story to deal with the loss of his girlfriend? Is Big George his boss? Is Bug an actual Bug, or just slowly turning into one? What exactly do the Blue Globes want? And so \"You Bright and Risen Angels\" roars and rages and like a wild guitar solo, ridiculous, dissonant, absurd, and sometimes going so far over the top it doubles back over itself. The book is packed with ideas and conflicting philosophies. The villains: Dr. Dodger and Mr. White, are cartoonish stereotypes of ruthless industrialists, horrific, bumbling, irredeemably bad. The revolutionaries who oppose them initially seem like clear cut good guys, but when Bug and his gang starts murdering kids for fun, we can't trust that they are entirely admirable either. The confrontation between leftist extremists and right-wing extremists has no winner (and the moral equivalence between Nazism and Stalinism was again revisited by Vollmann in \"Europe Central\"). It's a dimension of subtlety in what might seem like a violent video game of a book.Vollmann throws in plenty of references to Hitler, quotations by Marx and Hegel and Rand, there's allusions to economics and politics, yet this is in no way a \"philosophical\" book or a serious work of political ideas. The intellectual layer exists to be parodied and mocked, not explored through subtle nuances. This is a book about doing drugs and getting into gunfights and fighting insects and scheming against your tyrannical boss; the pure wish-fulfillment fantasy jars against the philosophical references, and its this tension that Vollmann exploits for so much energy. You can never tell what the next chapter might bring: a weird descent into hallucinatory political philosophy, or a prison break out. Both are presented with the same verve.I read \"You Bright and Risen Angels\" in a little more than two weeks. It's a long book, and if one attempted to read it slowly, I think the sarcastic tone, unrelenting violence, and general abrasiveness would grow dull. Consumed in a quick burst, however, this explosion of ten-page paragraphs and ridiculous movements will be a whole lot of fun; it sure was for me.\"You Bright and Risen Angels\" is a flawed book, but in a way that's the point. It's a personal fantasy, a daydream, and as such none of the flaws really hurt my enjoyment. It's a salvaged wreck of a vehicle, patched and mended and covered in dirt, but it sure made the Kessel run in 12 parsecs!"}, {"userName": "Jimmy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1107219-jimmy", "userReview": "At the tail end of William T. Vollmann\u2019s sprawling epic about revolutions both metaphorical and historical, the reader is informed - in a footnote at the bottom of the page \u2013 that, \u201cThis is a bookish novel because I, the author, know little of life, and I, Big George, will reveal no secrets.\u201d In the beginning of the novel, this selfsame \u201cauthor\u201d (clearly Vollmann himself; utilizing a characteristic self-insertion that would become a trademark stylistic choice in a majority of both his fiction and non-fiction) lets the reader know that he is the one calling the shots as far as the plot is concerned. Of course, the important status of Big George is not to be overlooked, as he wields considerable power and influence over the author. Together, the two tell the story of the technological dawn of electricity, and how it was manipulated by wealthy landowners at the turn of the 20th century. What follows is a tale of power: the power of money, class, science, and war, and the resistance that power is met with when abused; in this case, by a marginal insect population.If the aforementioned plot summary sounds oblique or starkly confusing, then it should. The narrative encompasses the stories and sub-stories of over thirty characters. There are five sections to the book: two abstractly poetic codas, and three dense sections squeezed in between. It\u2019s told in voices that shift from second to third person perspective on a dime, and it's seldom clear exactly who is narrating at any given moment. No discernable chronology arises, rather one is simply alluded to. Some characters are prevalent throughout the entire story, while others show up for a minor vignette, never to appear again. Geographically, the primary setting is the Bay Area, but characters end up in the Arctic, as well as Afghanistan and parts of New York and Colorado. In other words, You Bright and Risen Angels, Vollmann\u2019s debut novel is a structural and stylistic mess. The good thing is that it\u2019s a mess in the tradition of transgressive fiction such as Naked Lunch. In fact, the science-fiction and dreamlike elements of the storytelling techniques used, resemble that particular novel in the same way that Vollmann\u2019s Whores for Gloria resembled that of a Hubert Selby Jr. story, albeit there is something ostensibly political about the value of this particular narrative. The intention seems to be to utilize exaggerated repulsiveness in order to make points about class alienation, but class alienation that is biological in some ways, e.g., the fact that the insects comprise the revolutionary faction in the book. Thomas Pynchon would be another easy influence (primarily in the historical fiction sense because the two share a similarly quirky sensibility when it comes to retelling stories of the past, especially those based on actual events) to peg on Vollmann, especially V. which shares the status of being an audaciously confident debut novel, even though he dismisses Pynchon\u2019s influence in the same incredulous manner that William Gaddis had dismissed the influence of James Joyce when questioned by critics about similarities between the authors' respective books. The importance and necessity of citing influences before discussing the actual plot summary is that, at this point in his career, Vollmann was creating a fictional world based purely on his own imagination, rather than one motivated by his experiences as a traveler and journalist. Always a writer willing to address the importance of the influence of his literary and historical forefathers (a quote is listed at the beginning of every chapter, and there are many), Vollmann worked with what he had in his head at the time, creating an overwhelming byproduct of his insane imagination; a culimination of the reading that informed his political perception of what revolution and power were all about. The division of ideology, as represented through the characters in the story, is basically dualistic in that there are two competing factions, the human (presumably caucasian and militaristic) reactionaries and the insect revolutionaries. In the first section of the book entitled \u201cThe History of Electricity\u201d, the story begins with the entrepreneurial rise of Mr. White. Mr. White, a financier, modeled after - who one can only assume would be that famous pioneer consumer of electricity - J. Pierpont Morgan, takes advantage of the technological phenomenon, using it to create a vast empire of wealth. Vollmann has his fictional characterization of greed compete with Edison, or at least briefly interact with him, which is a confusing aspect of the story. It\u2019s more like Edison is simply mentioned alongside White in order to elucidate the importance of electricity in the construction of White\u2019s fortune. It's worth noting that it's with historical fiction interludes such as these that the underlying logic of the plot falls into complications. The Society of Daniel is a school for electrical engineers designed in order to assist White in his competitive race for power, which, even early on in the story, already seems somewhat finalized, aims to suggest that Mr. White is the most powerful man in the universe (the universe of the story; again, one would assume that either the author or Big George are the most powerful). As Vollmann forces the narrative along - at a dense and confounding pace - more characters are introduced. For the most part these are unsympathetic sketches. The reactionaries all work for Mr. White, with the help of his aid, Dr. Dodger, running the Society of Daniel. Again, as the chronology of the story moves rapidly back and forth \u2013 the gap being something between 1879 and the early 1980\u2019s \u2013 the reader is able to grasp the basic gist of when and where a character is and what side of the class war they are on through cultural and technological allusions. Bug, the leader of the revolutionaries, is introduced through descriptions of a student union organization referred to as the \u201cKuzbuites\u201d, a fictional revolutionary party that seems to suggest something Russian-sounding and revolutionary, such as Bolshevism. Bug is an insect (obviously), which is a detail metaphorically emphasized to suggest that he is a marginal figure, and something along the lines of Darwinian racism is illustrated in a childhood filled with acts of hatred and violence directed toward him simply because he is a bug. As he grows up, he becomes immersed in Kuzbuism, eventually outgrowing it intellectually. Subsequently after this, Bug forms a more sophisticated group of revolutionaries fighting against Mr. White and his imperialistic push for world domination.There are so many loose ends, plot holes, unexplained character connections, and arbitrary storylines, that it\u2019s difficult to settle on what aspect of this densely satirical novel to criticize Vollmann for. A majority of the novel truly reads like a bunch of disparate short stories and vignettes. While some of these are relevant to the plot, others function like silly jokes, punctuating this confusing story. His first attempt at the novel is not without its merits though. Vollmann writes with a sympathy that displays a moral concern for the socially oppressed; suggesting via the insect metaphor (which has a fair share of Kafkaesque connotations outside of the obvious bug thing) that most revolutionaries are condemned to a social existence in which they struggle their entire lives to no avail, discovering that their two most appealing options in life would be either suicide or treachery. While the actual characters themselves come off as shallow and two-dimensional, what\u2019s being suggested by their placement in the story is importantly conveyed to the reader in a humanistic and thoughtful manner. It\u2019s a book not without successful attempts at black humor as well. Vollmann insightfully criticizes the absurdity and occasional uselessness of ideology and intellectualism. In the end, the suggestion is that the bugs remain oppressed, but through the complexity and dense experimentation of the story, their struggle is told with a vested interested in the depravity of war."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "This big thing was on my shelf for so long I often mistook it for an ugly minimalist sculpture.

The second thing I do is take my pill because I obviously forgot to for several days.) First of all: wow. That Vollmann wrote this at so precocious an age is a testament to his innate and incomparable talent. You can't fake this level of writing behind flash. It's almost criminal to be able to reel off prose this good in your mid-20s. Depending on your edition, the photo you see of WTV either has him with a gun to his head or smiling cocksure against a wall. Regardless, you notice immediately (in either photo) how amazingly young he is.This youth shows up in the writing in spades. No one would accuse You Bright and Risen Angels of being the work of a mature artist OR a mature human being; it's the product of kid getting off on the momentum of his own, self-created mythology. Whether it's shooting cops, shooting out the eyeballs of kids, or shooting smack, Vollmann practically taunts his reader: 'am I shocking you?' No, but you are entertaining the living hell out of me. It's the literary equivalent of 'up against the wall, motherfucker' and were one the right age, I suppose, it could seem inspiring (it certainly doesn't feel lived-in). The Author's Note is enough to scare off Christians and semaphorists alone... But hell, it's all so much fun that sitting here trying to analyze it drains out some of its not-insignificant life's blood.

And our hero is kind of turning into a bug? With time spent in sewers and in the maybe arctic tundra? Plus it's kind of a love story. Plus it's really digressive and hard to read. And it takes place in pretty much real-world San Francisco in the eighties, and it's crazy freaking Vollmann, so it's not really sci-fi or anything.

Odd in his personality; the man has cultivated enough myths around his extreme novels to be something of a meme in the literary world (and let us all pat ourselves on the back for not creating Chuck Norris-style \"Vollman facts\"). But also, and more pertinent to my project right here, odd from a stylistic point of view. And I don't mean the fact that this novel concerns the war between the insects and the forces of electricity, with giant beetles and transcontinental railroads and sexual shenanigans in the observatory where the master of the forces of electricity worked and a near-Unabomber perspective on good old modern electricity. Yes, this is an eccentric plot point, but [i]too[/i] weird? Dude's a postmodern novelist, so these sorts of hijinks are par for the course. No, what's odd about Vollmann is how he writes these novels that have the outward appearance of meticulous organization and yet are, when you actually sit down and [i]read[/i] 'em, haphazard as all get-out. In terms of his stylistic preferences and themes and so forth, he sits well in the Gaddis/Pynchon/McElroy school (& let me be the first to acknowledge that yes maybe we're all sick of saber-rattling about Important White Guy Authors so I'll drop this thread pretty soon), but unlike those authors, who seem to organize their apparent chaos quite meticulously, Vollmann seems to just sort of slop a ton of ideas together. I mean sure, these novels have elaborate chapter-subchapter headings and repeated motifs and Strategically Placed Illustrations and all of this other stuff, but I mean for fuck's sake so much of this book is just [i]sloppy[/i] in its construction.The general idea I got from reading this is Vollmann had no idea how to structure a mega-tome yet, and judging by his later work he never got better at organizing or developing his myriad ideas; he just sort of plastered on more, more, more. Even the brief Whores for Gloria suffers from this; it doesn't so much have a plot that develops as a psychological state that swelters and fractures until it breaks down on the streets of the Tenderloin. Or remember, if you happen to have read it, the pages upon pages of Europe Central that more or less amount to \"boom, here's another execution carried out in East Germany, boom, here's another execution carried out in East Germany, boom, here's Shostakovich having weird sex, boom, here's Shostakovich having more weird sex.\" The dude is the master of tacking on [i]more[/i]. Want a concrete example? Oh, I've got it. The \"narrator-Big George\" conflict. I think the idea here was the produce a metafictional device about how history becomes repurposed based on the tellers, but it doesn't seem much more substantial or well-rounded than an extended acknowledgment of the fact, which means it doesn't really serve much purpose except to be there, especially not since Vollman doesn't really do much to distinguish their voices. Want another example? The pages upon pages of post-adolescent poetry about a girlfriend that abandoned the narrator. He comes off as a real creep, first off, passive-aggressive and wallowing, and what's more is it doesn't add a fucking thing to the narrative, and my question is just \"why is it here, why is every chapter interrupted with this?\" Yet reader! I cannot tell a lie! It was a horde of raging cannibals who were also aliens who chopped down your beloved cherry tree erm I mean this book is goddamn entertaining when it isn't indulging in the painful lost-love story (I mean for fuck's sake what is this doing here), because well there's just no way I won't be entertained by the rambling story of a group of insects waging war against the forces of electricity, and also because when he isn't wallowing in his misery - if anyone can oversell a point, it's Vollmann - our man in California can cook up some mean sentences. I realize all the criticism might point to a lower star rating, but goddammit Vollmann is really good at the stuff he's good at and it's also quick and easy to explain the stuff he's good at, entertaining premises and beautiful sentences. There are some truly immersive scenes here, too - a revolutionary attack on a computer-programming center, some really wrenching memories of the protagonist's experiences at summer camp, a bizarre and not-fully-realized but still weirdly fulfilling description of an expedition in the Amazon, the Revolutionaries' nightmare trek into the arctic - and if you've read my reviews, you know that kind of stuff gets my literary hackles up. Plus I also love the sense he gives that this war is a part of something bigger, that the book doesn't end when you close it. Vollmann, for all his flaws, for this book's desperate need of an editor, can really fucking tell a story, and the fact that he can pull that off despite the dozens of pages that go absolutely nowhere either speaks volumes about Vollmann's talent or about my own tastes. Either way, the dull moments are substantially outweighed by passages I couldn't put down. In honesty there's a lot I dislike about Vollmann, and I don't imagine I'll ever give one of his books the full five stars, but when he gets it all together you can't stop him."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2329948-david", "userReview": "The world's a crazy place. And if it were a utopia, You Bright and Risen Angels would've been impossible to make, let alone conceive. So thank God there's at least ten different wars going on right now.Accordingly, Vollmann starts his debut novel with a quote from one of the most hated world leaders ever. \"If I can send the flower of the German nation into the hell of war without the smallest pity for the shedding of precious German blood, then surely I have the right to remove millions of an inferior race that breeds like vermin.\" That'd be Adolf Hitler for you.Like most Post-Modern works, it's extremely redundant to state that what follows can't be explained in 140 characters or less. But it's true. And even more so You Bright and Risen Angels than any other book in history (only Gravity's Rainbow or the works of William S. Burroughs trumps this in sheer lunacy). The simplest synopsis: Bugs vs. electricity, revolutionaries vs. reactionaries, and don't you ever forget, Vollmann is at liberty to do whatever the hell he wants to at any time. This is a fevered passion piece comprised of dreams and nightmares, put together in increments and sudden explosions by a writer who is as awed by the universe as a child is. Don Quixote-esque in its delusions; we, the reader, are it's dumbfounded Sancho. Essentially, one idiom is true for Vollmann and his complete mastery of the run-on sentence (this is a good thing) and that is if the writing's good, the readers will come. This is creative genius put to pen without restraint. Normally, under such circumstances, the creator might just be batshit insane, but here, Vollmann let's his imagination loose. This is not to say that Vollmann's prose is as unreadable as many Post-Modern works, but only that the ideas and structure are. Run-on sentences are run-on, but fluid, and completely legible; each sentence absolutely necessary. You Bright and Risen Angels treats the world like a playground--like almost every good Post-Modern work does. And it's brimming with hilarity. The highs are incredible, and happen so often one may have to take a breather before continuing on. Take for instance the city of lost children between the subway tracks one of our heroes recalls (the kind of absurd fear that only a child can imagine). Or K.U.N.T. (Kuzbu Union for a National Turnaround), which is used as the title for a organization open for donation when one of our characters goes door-to-door; humorous for obvious reasons, but also because of the situational comedy that happens when the character spreading this propaganda isn't well liked and constantly a nervous wreck and the doors he knocks on are home to unruly people that just want to have their dinner in peace and quiet, and quite literally, he is scared or chased back into the street, when the name of the organization is, after all, KUNT; one chapter is called, THE SPREAD OF KUZBUISM; this is followed by four lines that make up a quote, and then this: Meanwhile, Kuzbuism spread. End of chapter. After the revolutionaries (those on the side of the bugs, the closest to this book's protagonists, Their faces were blackened into swollen masks of desiccated purpose. (Of course, as long as their hearts were whole and entire, the Devil would be afforded lodgment.) They were cariously unclean, like today's supercharged worker. In their sleep they sucked their own breasts., led by the one known as Bug, opposite the reactionaries and the power of electricity) are involved in a one-sided highway battle with a car full of children and a wife and husband (they kill them mercilessly because they're rich), they gather what money they can find from their corpses: ...and Milly shot the man twice, and he fell forward against the steering wheel, careening the Buick against Bug's car, but Milly and Susan pushed it off with a pole and it flipped over off the highway. - \"Two hundred forty-two dollars Canadian,\" said Milly, going through the wallet. - \"Sixty-three dollars,\" said Susan, counting the haul from the purse. - \"Excellent,\" said Bug. - He drove smoothly to the nearest rest area, and they had a picnic lunch. After several pages of horror there is no brief intermission, but suddenly comedic relief. Another favorite, although more subtle, is when we follow Newt's apprenticeship under the malevolent Mr. White (Newt, for a long time, was Mr. White's kindred spirit, and the one that had the mathematical prowess to move his empire forward). In the chapter's doom-laden climax, Vollmann incorporates a sketch of the students, including Newt, in Mr. White's class. This is a \"still\" before an exam; the kids look mischievous and excited and have on their mind that they're going to cheat as soon as Mr. White exits the premises. All fun and games until . . . Mr. White returns unexpectedly and catches the children running amok and cheating, and in a skirmish Newt kills (as ordered by the blue globes) the girl he has a crush on, incinerating her to ashes, and then we think back to the picture only a few pages prior, which seemed completely unnecessary at the time, and what does Mr. White say, father of the girl Newt just killed in cold blood, but \"Newt, you've got quite a whipping coming to you.\", which is a clever and absurd way of saying that Mr. White's profits and attempts at world domination come first. Vollmann's world is as absurd as Burgess's in A Clockwork Orange, but this time around we feel that just about anything can happen. And soon, we begin to realize that it will.One may gather from reading the previous that Vollmann doesn't know how to weave a page-turning story with actual plot and character development. But that's far from the truth. The reason why this book succeeds on almost an incomprehensible level is because he's able to weave the absurd and the heart-touching so effortlessly. There is the vignette of Parker as a child coming home from school and finding a caterpillar on his driveway. He rescues it, takes it inside, feeds it, and happily awaits its transformation into a butterfly. And then: A week later as he came home the snow was melting. It was getting warm. He saw the hornets stirring out of their nest under the eaves. He went into his room. Inside the jar were brown bits of something and an open cocoon. A butterfly or moth had beaten itself to pieces trying to get out of the jar. What is more vulnerable to the triumphant roar of civilization? A child or a bug? Vollmann wishes to state that both are, for many different reasons. There are echoes of Vollmann's real life insecurity, the watery depth his characters literally and figuratively plunge into, and his sister who drowned to death in a swimming pool when he himself was a kid and her sole protector, and then the world opened up bright with a new kind of pain and absurdity. We are insects too, against progress, because not all progress helps the betterment of humanity. Progress, by definition, means that something of nature must be overcome, and what more than the nation of bugs? Until we're left to feed on each other, that is. ...and from then on, if all he had for a weapon was goodness and rightness, he felt a strong sense of fear and powerlessness. Everything he learned was making him more like an insect. Halfway through the book we learn of the horrors of the bugs at the hand of the humans. One particular chapter details grotesquely the execution of several beetles, a nightmarish prison holocaust where limbs are ripped from meaty chitin hides, which instigates the revolt against the oppressors. While we have life, we have hope. While we have hope, we have courage. While we have courage, we have ingenuity. While we have ingenuity, we have flame-throwers. A state of war now exists between us and the bugs. A novel so pressed with purpose every paragraph bubbles and every sentence resonates on some level, if not the level intended. There are allusions to this work in David Foster Wallace's first novel, The Broom of the System (not to mention his short stories and Infinite Jest, which, at times, doesn't seem to have the vested interest of the reader at heart), but nowhere does it bridge the gap between maniacal obsessive Post-Modernism and humanity itself (it appears that The Pale King was going to be his first novel-length crack at it, but that's another story). But this euphoric first novel does all of that and more. You Bright and Risen Angels is not only sorely underrated, but a marvel in prose, a work from a maximalist who's not afraid of actually trying to make you feel something. A rarity, indeed."}, {"userName": "Louis-Jean Levasseur", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5857111-louis-jean-levasseur", "userReview": "You Bright and Risen Angels (1987) is, among many things, a science fiction novel. Not postmodern sci-fi \u00e0 la Vonnegut or the kind that exploit SF imagery as a material, but a cartoonesque, surrealist, unbound science fiction novel, stricto sensu.I wouldn\u2019t have said that prior to read Pynchon\u2019s Against the Day (2006), a novel about, among many more things, the dreams the early 20th century made of his potential futures; something like the science fiction of the past (Mason & Dixon is not so far either). Obviously, science have always preoccupied american litterature from Poe\u2019s ratiocination to Burroughs mutant bio-technology, but it seems to me now that contemporary fiction which has scientific discourses as an object (Neal Stephenson\u2019s Baroque cycle for example) tends to revisit the past, to reach back to the primitive and delirious vision that underlies the world as we know it. And this is the case here. From the outset, the book opens with an epic \u00abhistory of electricity\u00bb, going back at a time when political and electrical power overlap. He extends it to a dystopic world which merges antique atomism with ideological repression and control. Polarity reversals between the revolutionary and reactionary forces are caused by agents provocateurs, unstable electrons, insects (the underdog) and the blue globes, those evil entities of electrical current similar to the interstellar ones engendered by electricity according to the ariosophy of Lanz-Leibenfels in nazi mysticism, and maybe the ancestors of Skip, the anthropomorphized lightning ball in Against the Day\u2026I made some generic considerations but a formal analysis of this book can only be exhaustive (metamediatised narration: cartoon, computer games, programming language, war chronicles, charge activation process rather than coming of age stories, etc.). I can understand David Foster Wallace claiming You Bright and Risen Angels to be \u00abtoo Pynchonian\u00bb out of rivalry [T.D. Max, Every Love Story Is A Ghost Story, p. 316] just as you could have found it too burroughsian when it first came out, but I think that it may be easier to appreciate its own merits now that Vollmann\u2019s subsequent efforts has proved to be the result of a singular voice apart from his literary models."}, {"userName": "George", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9225700-george", "userReview": "I, Big George, was blown away, BOOM, by this cartoon; it was full of bugs and blue globes(balls); they consumed my mind for the past few months.

You Bright and Risen Angels is a highly energetic, very ridiculous book that is both very angry at the way the world has been remade by humanity, and too invested in the absurd portraiture of its premise to work as a really coherent piece of literature. It avoids getting didactic or preachy like some satire, but also takes too much pleasure in the grotesque, Bill Burroughs-junk-nightmare business of a war between electric industrialists and bugs. Major plot points (and many leaves of writing) include earplugs that grant bug powers, a guy who replaces his bodily fluids with photo developing chemicals, and a giant man-eating caterpillar that is erotically irresistible to the same character. The sheer volume of the pulpy material in this book seems to indicate 1) that Vollmann at this point must have been mainly writing for the fun of it (and as dumb as it often is, it's fun to read) and 2) that despite the Hegel- and Heidegger-drops, etcetera, he doesn't want it to be read as some kind of highbrow allegory within a profane shell.Of course, there's a very blatant pairing going on with the elect, rapacious, self-serving forces of industry and the naturalistic but equally brutal hordes of insect loserdom. In between are most of the human characters whose placements are pretty much prescribed. They get sorted out as reactionaries and revolutionaries, and in a few cases jump back and forth, because they have no other choice. Their efforts are acts of fatal submission, even in the case of the leaders - the robber barons themselves can't help being what they are, and it doesn't save them. I am as I am and so will I be. It's not the tragic rendering that we get when the theme gets more fleshed out in Argall, what with all the lunatic shit burdening it. Still, let's not think that Bill doesn't care about even the dullest of his characters - they are, as it were, his bright and risen angels. The sense of repentance and uneasiness he expresses about their creation makes me wonder whether this isn't authorial posturing, since his later books show a lot more comfort with fictionalizing the lives of historical people. He accords a lot of possible truth value to alternate tellings, myths, notably dreams, as do many of the less industrialized societies he later explores.

First, Vollmann managed to destroy the economic super-structure by flailing to find the voice of the author for 90 pages, finally honing it so the book gets fun for 40 pages and then boldly abandoning that tone for something much more leaden for the remaining 500 pages. Next Vollmann righteously punished all the CEOs of big, bad corporations by constantly pointing out that nobody in the world is as clever as Billy Vollmann. Could a CEO include epigrams by sources as diverse as Lenin and a Unix manual? Maybe.

At the same time, Vollmann doesn't lose the story in the weirdness. The story is still solid, even with the focus on the weirdness, making for a truly memorable book."}, {"userName": "Patton McGinley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2122634-patton-mcginley", "userReview": "it's a novel. no, it's a cartoon. wait! it's both... and much more."}, {"userName": "Annabelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92453-annabelle", "userReview": "I feel like bugs and electricity are forever, the end."}, {"userName": "peter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23682-peter", "userReview": "A plodding wasteland stretching for metaphoric depth at every turn.I'd like to have the time I spent on this book back, but unfortunately that's not possible."}], "description": "In the jungles of South America, on the ice fields of Alaska, the plains of the Midwest, and the streets of San Francisco, a fearsome battle rages.

A brusque La Pasionara with the sprightly name of Millie leads an intrepid band of revolutionaries. You Bright and Risen Angels is the work of an extraordinary imagination.
