The heroine returns home after ten years as a captive, and the hero is torn with guilt for not having prevented her abduction when she was a child. There is an added sense of mystery over who attacked her home and killed her parents ten years ago. If you can ignore the co-incidence that both the hero and the heroine go her old home for the first time in ten years and just happen to be there at the same moment, then the story gets off to a great start.And then it fizzles out.For almost a hundred pages, nothing much happens. The heroine gets introduced to a lot of new people and we get endless boring conversations about what has happened to her since she was abducted. Or she mulls over those years in flash backs. Or the heroine and the hero ride off to interview people who might have information about the attack ten years ago. They never really find out anything but we get introduced to a lot more new characters. The story does not move forward at all - it simply covers the same ground over and over again.The romance aspect is no better. The heroine was nine, the hero seventeen when they were parted. In the beginning, as they are reunited, there is some heavy lust. Not the bittersweet reunion of old friends one might expect. Then it gets a bit vague -- at times, the heroine really feels the lust between them. At other times she moans that the hero either doesn't notice her at all, or sees her as a child. The hero, in his turn, is racked with lust and plainly in love, but somehow he believes that to do the right thing by the heroine he must find a good man for her to marry and make sure the husband will treat her well. It never seems quite clear why he ignores the obvious solution of marrying her himself. At one point the hero seems to think it would be wrong for him to marry the heroine because he feels lust for her - but surely, it's good in marriage if there is desire between the spouses? I never get the impression that the hero is against settling down in general--he just seems to think that he shouldn't consider marrying the heroine, and the only reason there appears to be is because it is needed to drag out the plot.In the end, lust wins, the hero has sex with the heroine, and then everything becomes clear in his mind and of course he should marry her. We have the revealed twist from the past (a twist that was obvious, at least to me, from early on) and we get a bit of a problem from a mean, lying neighbour who tries to ruin the romance. I tried to keep skimming but by the final third I was too bored even for that.On the steaminess scale, there are a couple of lukewarm love scenes, so steamy isn't really the right classification. Middle-of-the-road, nothing to offend even the more delicate sensibilities.It seems puzzling that the heroine has been sold twice from man to man and is still a virgin. And just as puzzling that when she finally gets to have sex, pretty much a quickie, there is no pain involved and instant fulfilment. I'd prefer a bit more realism in the physical aspects of the romance.The writing is nice and competent, but the endless repetition ruined it for me. In particular, I found it tedious to wade through the dialogues which were regurgitating information already known to the reader, with very little added in terms of characterisation or plot development. So, in summary, this book was not for me. But once again, I'm in the minority. There must be something wrong with me."}, {"userName": "SheLove2Read", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1708674-shelove2read", "userReview": "So much potential wasted. Repetitious dialogue from the heroine and hero both. She retelling the story of her abduction and years living with the Comanche (again, completely wasted opportunity for good background story), and he repeating ad nauseam how he wants to do the right thing by her and find her a husband, just not him, even though he has fallen for her. My main complaint however is that the heroine who is described as \"beautiful\", lived among the Comanche AND was sold not once but twice to traders somehow manages to come away a virgin. Sorry, I'm not buying it. I was born at night but not last night. 1.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Celestine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13928747-celestine", "userReview": "This was an engaging western romance with interesting characters and a suspenseful plot line. Where it goes wrong is in the pacing. Matt Ryan is the quintessential cowboy hero: rough, rugged, handsome and honorable. Molly Hart is the heroine with a twist: she is a hopeful survivor. This girl goes through a lot, which unfolds in pieces throughout the book. I found the twists and turns to be interesting, but I wish Molly's background had been handled more in action rather than telling. She also was magnificently well adjusted given the horrors of her young life. However, McCaffrey infuses her book with a lot of good action, spicy yearnings and outstanding scene set-ups. The part with the runaway horse was particularly well written. I won't soon forget Matt and Molly."}, {"userName": "Jonel Boyko", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15432163-jonel-boyko", "userReview": "This story is very captivating, but in a subtle way. McCaffrey doesn\u2019t feel the need to draw her readers in with over the top scenes and descriptions. She takes real life (for the time period and setting) and draws the reader in with immaculate writing and flawless scenes. The story is very insightful and informative while also being extremely heartfelt. McCaffrey does a brilliant job with her descriptions and scene setups. Her descriptions are so detailed that you feel like you are on the ranch with the characters. That said, she never once writes a scene that makes the reader feel like they are bogged down in description. Every single word that McCaffrey puts down on paper brings the reader further into the story, and closer to a brilliant conclusion. Although you can guess the general gist of the conclusion well before you get there, it\u2019s all in the journey, and McCaffrey makes that spectacular.Although very few people have been through situations such as those faced by the main character she is still a very approachable person. All of the characters are developed in such a way that you can identify with them, which allows the reader to immerse themselves more fully into the story. There are definitely situations and aspects that set them apart, but McCaffrey\u2019s stunning character development keeps them very realistic and down to earth. The development of all of the major characters includes a full personal history, which adds to this realism. I love these characters, especially the fact that absolutely none of them seem at all fake or made up, regardless of the fact that this is a fictional novel.This is one of those stories that makes your heart ache at times, while at others makes you fell all warm and fuzzy inside. I\u2019m crying happy tears right now. It\u2019s very rarely that a romance novel can move me this much. I can still feel it tugging at my heartstrings.Please note that I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Emily Crow", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23080450-emily-crow", "userReview": "Molly Hart was kidnapped from her family's ranch by mysterious outlaws as a little girl, then stolen by Commanches. Many years later, she returns home to find that her parents were killed and their ranch was abandoned. She meets Matt Ryan, a man from a nearby ranch whom she looked up to as a big brother all those years ago. Their attraction now is anything but sibling-like, but Matt feels too protective of Molly to make a move on her. Meanwhile, she wants to figure out who killed her parents all those years ago and has to adjust to her new circumstances.It was an OK book, and I will start with the positives: I really enjoyed the late 1800s Texas setting and Molly's memories of living with the Comanche, and how she struggles with not knowing her identity now. I also thought Molly and Matt were both sympathetic characters. My biggest problem with the book is that it is very slow paced and events are parceled out almost stingily for the first three quarters of it. Then, at the end, everything happens at once, including quite a few improbably events and annoying romance tropes. It's free on Amazon, though, so if you enjoy historical Western romance, it might be worth checking out.Read for Unapologetic Romance Readers 2017 challenge: Cowboy/Western category"}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6109217-caroline", "userReview": "I got this book free off Amazon and I'm glad that I didn't pay anything for it. It's received some great reviews from people but it didn't do anything for me I'm afraid. I didn't connect with Molly and what had happened to her - in fact I felt most of story just didn't really ring true. I think this is partly due to the fact that she lived for a quite a few years with the Indians but there was no real story about how she got on there and what happened to her. And then she gets traded to this trader who is meant to be a bad man who does nothing to her; and then he sells her to some old man who is a gold miner; who mainly ignores her but spent quite a lot of money to 'save' her. Then she travels across a large expanse of America to return home; again with no back story about how she did this. And throughout all of this nothing happens to her. I just quite believe it. So I'm afraid her story just didn't ring quite true and I couldn't connect with her.

It is so refreshing to read something that has a plot and no sex. Well, there was some, but it was almost closed door, it was so little.Molly is awesome. She is as strong as they come. She has been through a lot, and finally made her way back home. Matt is strong in an almost broken way, when we first meet him. He has been through a lot too, and blames himself for Molly's disappearance/death.I laughed a lot when Matt was trying to figure out what to do with Molly. He had some truly ridiculous plans. Molly was true to her age, and the time. She was innocent in some ways, but not so much in others. Her time with the Indians exposed her to things that the white folk would never do.Very satisfying read. There is even a mystery in there.

Right now Goodreads is showing this one with a 4.17, which is extremely generous for this simplistic love story. The Wren starts off abruptly, with Molly and Matt both just happening to revisit the scene of a former tragedy at the same moment. She has spent the last 10 years as a prisoner of the Comanche and then a slave to an old miner (yet somehow still has her virginity intact, lucky girl). He has recently survived being held and tortured by a Mexican bandit, and as a Texas Ranger has seen a lot of hard times. McCaffrey certainly tells the readers how damaged these two people are, but it doesn't really show in the story. Molly seems nearly unscathed, beyond worrying what people might think of her, and Matt is hesitant to settle down.There are some high points to the novel interspersed with amateur scenes. I loved the description of Molly racing bareback across the Texas plain in only her chemise, and did enjoy the chemistry between the two leads. But overall, barely 3 stars. Also, I just noticed the book summary indicates that this one is \"steamy,\" which is a bit of an exaggeration."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6867864-cynthia", "userReview": "I won a copy of this book from the author. I was not required to give a favorable review. All thoughts are my own. This is a wonderful story that is well written. Molly was a young girl when her parents were killed on their ranch and she was kidnapped. She didn't know what happened to both her parents and her sisters. The men that kidnapped her, some were killed and others got away from a group of Comanche. She was finally was able to get back to some normallcy when a man bought her to save her life. But then he passed and she decided she needed to get back to Texas. When she gets to the ranch she fines it run down and her parents grave site. But the biggest shock is finding Matthew the young man she cared for when she was taken, she lost 10 years of being around. He didn't believe she was a live at first. This is a beautiful story of overcoming loss, finding realness again, and helping another young person along the way.

Both are products of their time and the way they were raised, but still described in a way that makes them credible. I especially liked Molly, who had gone through difficult circumstances including being kidnapped as a child by a tribe of Texas Indians, but had a feisty spirit that helped her survive all of those circumstances. Matt was a good, valiant man who initially did not think himself worthy of a personal relationship with Molly\u2014too old, too damaged\u2014but soon came to the point where he could not fight the deep connection between them. The secondary characters all do their parts to add to the story\u2019s depth.

It was also interesting that at least 3 people in the story had quite a lot of suffering and even some of it is physical suffering ones as well.

I suppose if you locate the novel on a ranch in West Texas populated by cowboys, Texas Rangers, ranch hands, cattle, and rattlesnakes, and place it in time just after most of the Indian wars, then it counts as historical fiction.

Throw in some physical danger, tragedy and sorrow, surprising situations, romance and titillation, a strong masculine hero, a struggling, vulnerable love interest, and a happy \"and they all lived happily ever-after\" ending....and you have the makings of a story that will bring satisfied sighs to those who enjoy reading romance fiction."}, {"userName": "Lyngay", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23505536-lyngay", "userReview": "Dying is easy, survival is not for sissies.I bought the rest of the series books because of this e story.

Now, at nineteen, she\u2019s finally returning home to north Texas after spending the remainder of her childhood with a tribe of Kwahadi Comanche. What she finds is a deserted home coated with dust and the passage of time, the chilling discovery of her own gravesite, and the presence of a man she thought never to see again.Matt Ryan is pushed by a restless wind to the broken-down remains of the Hart ranch.
