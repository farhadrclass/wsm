I'm not usually a fan of anthologies or collections of short stories. So When Armand Rosamilia sent me Still Dying 2 I was skeptical. But I couldn't bring myself to say no to him. Perhaps it was his cool name, or the fact that he's such a nice guy who's stuck with The Bookie Monster since the beginning.Maybe skeptical isn't the right word. I was almost sad in advance, thinking I was about to not like my first piece of work from him and the other talented authors credited for their contributions.Holy moly, was I wrong! I was absolutely giddy after I finished the first story of the book. This never happens! Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean the floodgates are open and I'm going to change my review policy or anything.While all the stories were completely intriguing and unique, a few stood out and tickled my fancy. In How Me And Bozy Became Dads by Patrick C. Greene, inmates collecting trash on the side of the road witness a stumbling man hit by oncoming traffic. A group of \"creeps\" appear from the tree line. A family of four emerge from the car to find their victim isn't dead...in the traditional sense. Two inmates and the family make it away from the scene to discover one is bit. I liked seeing the hardness of the felon mix with compassion for the children.Gator Aid by Frank Edler was one of my favorites. In St Augustine, Florida, Gator Aid is the last operational gator farm in the state, considered a safe haven because the gators will eat anything foolish enough to step foot on their turf. With money now useless, food is used as currency to gain entry for the day. Never turn your back on the water...good lesson.The Trap Line by Sean Slagle. You just know it's never going to be good when you see the words \"undead\" and \"bloated sex organs\" together.Dying Days: Television by Armand Rosamilia had me questioning myself. Patrick is a reclusive TV addict. I recognized all the references made in the story and thought oh shit. It's me! Luckily, I don't own 22 televisions, so I figure I'm not that bad...yet!The clear standout for me was The Old Man And The Apocalypse by A.D. Roland. An orphaned teen is forced to make a tough decision. She wants to live in safety with an old man, Otis, but she's a wolf in sheep's clothing; a Trojan horse sent in to recon a building for her loathsome group of bandits who have her ill brother back at camp. This story contained a depth that we don't usually see in the zombie genre. The characters were compassionate and I really rooted for them.The only thing I didn't particularly enjoy was the cover. It didn't connect with the content for me. Sure, if you want to get technical, it's a zombie on the cover of a zombie book. But I would have liked to see a connection between one of the stories held within. (Just not the bloated sex organs!)Go grab a copy, you'll be pleasantly surprised at what rewards lie within. bookie-monster.com"}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3983118-frank", "userReview": "STILL DYING 2 is an anthology based in Armand Rosamilia's DYING DAYS world with contributions from nine separate writers. This marks the first time Armand Rosamilia has opened up an anthology in his zombie ravaged world to other writers. The result is a well rounded reading experience marked by different approaches, moods and characters that seasoned veterans to the Dying Days series have become accustomed to. The beauty of this series is that because it does open up the point of view of Rosamilia's world it become very accessible to newcomers to the Dying Days world as well.NOTE: I am a contributing writer to this anthology and as such I won't comment on my story only the stories by others. (It goes without saying mine is the greatest ever.) WINK!How Me And Bozy Became Dads by Patrick C. Greene: A great story to open with. This takes place on a roadside in a quite ville in Somewhere, USA. It features a roadside clean up crew of local prisoners. A group of characters set in a story that questions roles, tropes and alignments. Not typical stuff for the zombie genre necessarily.The Trap Line by Sean Slagle: Dark. I don't just mean dark, I mean DARK. Though I found some parts of this story a bit ambiguous it finished strong with lots of action and a somewhat unexpected outcome. Did I mention this one is dark?Dying Days: Television by Armand Rosamilia: The first of two by the man responsible for all this madness. This one is whimsical and unabashedly points fingers at the reality TV shows that inundate our daily lives.Flight 509 by Jaime Johnesee: A compelling adventure of zombies in the sky. A real page turner. I was waiting for Sam Jackson to pop up from somewhere back in coach and proclaim, \"I've had enough of these mother fucking zombies on this mother fucking plane!\" This one gets dark too, but not Sean Slagle dark, that a special kind of dark.The Old Man And The Apocalypse by A.D. Roland: Another gripping tale that really makes you care about the characters in a short amount of time. I really thought this was going to go in one direction but it ends in a way I didn't see coming and it helped add a bit of a smile at the end.The Happiest Kingdom On Earth by Brent Abell: Zombies in the happiest place on Earth? I was sold on the premise alone. Though not the exact park we are all thinking of, it serves as a very close cousin in layout and feel. This story features a very cool villain. I did want more of a whirlwind adventure around the pseudo-kingdom with zombies and kinda got robbed of that expectation. Alas it was an unfair expectation and the story line that played out still stood up well.Dying Days: Stew by Armand Rosamilia: Offering number 2 from the egomaniac Rosamilia is a short piece more true to the Dying Days series. Character-centric with a feeling of being a small part of a bigger story.Lucifer's Revenge by Mark Tufo: My personal favorite in this collection. It features a priest, a sword, a few zombies and a mission from God. This really felt like a big set up for a future push of the main Dying Days story and I can't wait to see if my prediction holds true. Tufo is just a solid writer, he reads like Brian Keene if Keene stayed with zombies the whole way.Dying Days: Angel by Tim Baker: What I liked best about Tim Baker's closing story was to see a truly \"Tim Baker\" piece in a Dying Days world. Baker has collaborated twice with Armand on Dying Days stories but this one I really felt the true Tim Baker voice speak out all it's own. And it works, a crime thriller writer can survive in the end of days.So there is the break down. Each story draws elements from the already well established Dying Days world keeping them all solidly grounded in Armand Rosamilias world. Fans of the series won't be disappointed and should find all the stories true to the cannon. Zombie fans in general will still find ten great stories of many varieties and with enough rotting hungry corpses to feed your hunger. My self-serving recommendation: GET STILL DYING 2 today and indulge your need for zombies!"}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "So this is anthology of very talented authors; almost of fan love for the Dying Days series from Armand Rosamilia; all the stories are centred around characters or places within this series.How Me And Bozy Became Dads by Patrick C. Greene: a prison chain gang meets the undead! Told from one of the prisoners PoV with a real twang in his inner dialogue. Lots of really well written action, not too much gore, PCG has concentrated more on the terror and confusion. Not all is as it seems....what a great way to start this anthology, PCG is always so precisely written.Gator Aid by Frank Edler: Ava has set a trap at the only functioning amusement park left during the zompoc. Her little gang, with the help of the 'gators have a unique way of dispatching the zombies. A little dramatic love story in the middle too. Loved the macaw who has an angry streak but soft spot for M&Ms. Some really well thought out ideas and the writing pushes you towards caring for certain people, clever stuff.The Trap Line by Sean Slagle: I could have done without the detailed animal kill in the first paragraph and then had to stop reading at the rabbit in the trap description, I know its horror but I point blank will not read about animal torture. Sorry, this could have been the best story and the most fabulous author, just not for me.Dying Days: Television by Armand Rosamilia: So what is more important than television, even during the zompoc? Patrick has his life worked out, even to the last meal of the week, now if only he could sort out what is wrong with the tv. His poor neighbours try to help but actually end up being part of the problem. Snappily written with a little poke in the butt to some of today's societal issues.Flight 509 by Jaime Johnesee: chicken poop by his own admission our story teller hides in the 'planes bathroom rather than be mauled, eaten or raped by the undead - sounds like a good plan to me! Whilst stuck in there for nearly an hour he manages to go over all the options and most of his love life regrets. The ending to this little snapshot of horror really freaked me out. I was made to care about this chap by the author and it was scary and creepy despite most of the action happening on the other side of a door.The Old Man And The Apocalypse by A.D. Roland: Otis is a resourceful guy. He and his cat, Stupid are surviving and watching the undead pass by and try to molest the local sculptures. A really well thought out plan, ADR is a bit freaky in just how well she has thought this out, and I love it! Some really heart stopping and heart racing moment. My favourite story.The Happiest Kingdom On Earth by Brent Abell: George and Harry enter Milton Mouses Kingdom and get more than the rides and candy they planned for, what starts off as a joke soon turns sinister. Like a bizarre cross between Running Man, Dawn of the Dead and Mad Max. The ending was so sad. Fantastic writing.Dying Days: Stew by Armand Rosamilia: Stew and Orion, I loved this little team and wanted so much more than this little snippet of hell. Lucifer's Revenge by Mark Tufo: As Lucifer waits to hear confession all Hell literally breaks out around him. Some real tongue in cheek stuff here, very gore filled too in true MT style. Think this has the best line in the book; He tossed the Holy Water onto Kaitlin\u2019s face; he\u2019d been expecting something much more dramatic, like the melting of her face. All he got her was wet.Dying Days: Angel by Tim Baker: Angel is trying to make her way out her apartment complex before the zombies make her into the next meal, but she seems so accident prone. Not sure if it was the authors intention but I felt like the ball in a pinball machine game, bouncing off each wall, building, fence etc. exciting? I'm not sure, exhausting, yes!."}, {"userName": "Kelly Rickard", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15385541-kelly-rickard", "userReview": "This is a great way of finding new authors.
