The beautifully illustrated cover, storyline of a zombie apocalypse, and excerpt I read enticed me to give this series a try, and by the time I finished I knew this was a series I would continue. Phase One: Identify is a novella of approximately 86 pages that introduces us to a strong-willed, kick-butt protagonist, Tabitha or Tabs, and the rest of her small group that bands together to figure out how they are going to survive when the world as they know it comes crashing down all around them.The story is narrated from Tabitha\u2019s point-of-view only, so her character is the most well-rounded compared to the others who have yet to be fully developed. I\u2019m sure as the series develops, we will get to know the other characters better, and already I have begun to care about them and am eager to see what happens to them. As an adult reading the book, it was clear to me that Wynters kept her targeted young adult audience in mind as she developed the plot. The writing style and casual voice are geared for juvenile readers. Furthermore, she does a good job of depicting the horrors of zombie attacks without the gory details that may be too frightening for younger readers. The story starts off a bit slow but helps us get to know Tabitha and her outlook on life. She\u2019s just graduated from high school, still lives at home with her parents, and has no definite future plans. Just like most young adults starting their lives, she yearns for adventure, and definitely wants more than the monotony of working as a cashier in a small town grocery story. Little does she know, change is literally right outside the door.Unlike some books that begin in the aftermath of a zombie outbreak, Wynters immerses readers into the beginning of the apocalypse and, besides the action in the book, I was engaged in following the characters\u2019 gradual changes in mindset as they begin to grasp that the laws, rules, values that once helped stabilize society no longer apply, and by refusing to adapt, they continue to put their lives at risk. Tabitha\u2019s Dad, Dan, is a prime example of this. When the outbreak first occurs, he is a pillar of strength who keeps hope alive when the others are tempted to fall into an abyss of despair. However, as the plot unfolds, the young adults begin to see that his reluctance to act may get them killed. Dan still clings to the notion that the police and military will keep its citizens safe, and he is against the idea of Tabitha carrying a gun for protection. Although the adults are in charge of making decisions at the start of the story, they begin to take a backseat as Tabitha and Jayden, the twenty-year-old next door neighbor, gather weapons and lead the fight to keep their group safe. They understand that violence is necessary because there is no reasoning with the hoards of blood thirsty creatures slowly surrounding them, ready to attack.As with every good story, the danger escalates and the suspense builds as the group\u2019s situation becomes bleaker. The second half of the story is action-packed, intense, and the appearance of the mysterious, bad-ass Kellen toward the end gives Tabitha hope for their survival. Although Tabitha has been crushing on Jayden for years, she is mesmerized by Kellen from the time she first lays eyes on him. And she\u2019s not the only one. I\u2019m already anticipating the romance possibilities and conflicts that are sure to ensue as the dynamics of the characters\u2019 relationships with each other evolve. Overall, I found the reading experience enjoyable, but there were some aspects that I found troublesome. When the outbreak begins, Tabitha seems much too calm in telling readers what is happening. I don\u2019t feel the range of emotions or shock that I would expect anyone to have in witnessing humans attacking and killing one another. For me, the first part of the book lacked the vivid description I wanted as the drama unfolded. Throughout the entire story I am amazed at how calm, rational, and logical Tabitha is no matter how dire the situation or how much pressure she\u2019s under. She doesn\u2019t show the fear, confusion, and panic like the others around her, but perhaps her unusual attitude is what will make her a strong heroine as the series continues. There were a few grammatical flaws, mostly with use of to versus too that over time did begin to bother me, but not enough to interfere with my enjoyment of the story. I knew this was a novella when I started the book, but I was frustrated that just as the story gained momentum and I began to get invested in the plot, I was met with an epilogue. What disappointed me the most is that the book ended sooner than I would have liked. I\u2019m not a fan of novellas and rarely read them, so I wish that the start of the series had been a full length novel. Others, especially younger readers may not mind this; it\u2019s just my personal preference. So, I guess I will just have to patiently wait for the next installment. Please don\u2019t keep me waiting too long, Ms. Wynters!I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Randy Harmelink", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029520-randy-harmelink", "userReview": "Odd.

She's recently graduated high school and she's looking forward to the possibility of the rest of her life.Until all hell breaks loose in the store's parking lot. And smacks its bloody face up against the storefront window. A hell that looks like the reanimated dead, hungry for the living. And they're fast.Well written and quickly paced, the story moves swiftly into Tabitha reuniting not only with her parents, but also with her high school crush from next door, and her best friend and her dad. Considering it's the Night of the Living Dead, Tabitha is doing pretty well in the companion department. Plus, she's not whimpering in shock, throwing up in disgust, or doing anything slightly \"off.\" She's got her head on her shoulders and she's ready to take on the undead, Buffy-style. Gotta love it. The ending leaves the door wide open to the second book in the series. As Buffy, er, no I mean Tabitha and her friends are surrounded and about to become zombie food, a mysterious savior with glittering eyes appears. He was dressed completely in black, and his clothes didn't look cheap. The button down shirt was long-sleeved, but rolled up to his elbows, exposing tanned forearms. He was wearing a shoulder harness with a pistol tucked in one side. There was also a harness around his waist, with an extremely long pistol hanging partially down his thigh. Leaning over the hood, he aimed his shotgun and started firing. \u201cYou might want to move a little bit faster,\u201d he added sarcastically, over his shoulder. \u201cWe don't have all night.\u201dHa ha ha!

I was thoroughly surprised at how much I did really enjoy it. Rose Wynters had me gripped from the very first page.Phase 1 - Identify, as you can guess this is book one in the series. The story is the POV of 18 yrs old Tabitha Alexander who had just finished high school and she just wants to enjoy her freedom and have fun during the summer, and beyond that at that point nothing else is planned. That is, until one night, while working her boring job as a checkout girl the world as she knows it comes crashing down and all hell breaks loose.After a couple of minutes her survival instincts kick in and she knows she has to get home, back to her parents, By day two their little group of three becomes a group of six holed up in her parents house thinking their safe from the zombies, until somehow they find them. They don't know how the zombies know they are in there, but as soon as one starts banging to get in more and more appear. Tabitha takes control and Decides she's not gonna die and starts killing off the dead trying to get in, with the amount of them out there she starts thinking all is lost, until a car comes tearing into her street and a gorgeous man, (Kellan) gets out promising them safety.I'm not giving away any more spoilers, in fact I think I've given plenty for you to chew on. Rose Wynters has written this book beautifully it all flows very easily and is not over the top. The book is full of action from the beginning, there is blood and gore which is expected with blood thirsty zombies, but apart from that it's a nice clean read. Rose keeps you on the edge of your seat, and pulled in and gripped to the storyline that you don't want to put the book down, and you need to know what's going to happen next. I can't wait to get my teeth stuck into the next book. If I could I would give more than the five stars allowed, thoroughly recommend this series."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5089871-pam", "userReview": "Tabitha just wants to enjoy her summer.

She know right away it is about to get bad she has seen enough movies to know it's a zombie. She rushes home and there along with her parents they have to decide what their next step is.Tabitha at first seems a bored girl with no future plans. As the book progresses you see she cares about her family and friends, uses her head and not afraid to jump in to protect people. She slowly becomes someone even she didn't know exists. A survivor is what she has become and she wants to make sure she lives along with her fellow survivors. She also wants to see what has started this epidemic.I love books with zombies and this is a good start to a series. You get to see Tabitha come out of her shell, see how other people are taking the zombies taking over and the mystery of how did it start. There is still many questions to be answered but you see right away these are the fast moving zombies and they even seem to think if that is possible. I love the setting and as any zombie fan I want to know more of what is going on. The author does a good job hooking you in as you want more after finishing this book.

This was a nice and full start off to the story. It ends on a cliff hanger of course, but I felt the author did a great job of setting up the characters, their woes and life and deaths, and the progression of the story. A very good young adult zombie story, this should entertain the younger set that likes a bit of zombie groaning and gnawing with their teen angst.The story flows through a regular day of Tabitha at work, to fighting the undead, to being holed up with her family and her life long crush.

Tabitha definitely acted like any responsible eighteen year old would, instead of breaking down she realized she had to keep it together, otherwise she wasn't going to survive. I thought it was interesting to see some of the survivors come to together and watch how they reacted to each other. It was even more interesting to see the vastly different emotions and thought processes that play out through the book among the survivors.

Congratulations. If you're reading this letter, you're one of the survivors from the zombie apocalypse. Take care, or you won't last for long.I'm 18, and I just graduated this year. I didn't get to enjoy it, though. I was working at the grocery store as a checkout girl, when the first zombie slammed into the clear glass. I'll never forget the fear that washed over me at the sight of his red, hungry eyes. That night marked the loss of my innocence.... And my freedom.Now, my life is something different. No longer can we take the basic things for granted, not to mention our lives. The zombies destroyed our entire town that first night, including the family of the college guy I had a crush on. We were able to save him, but he's not the same. He's different, but so am I.Our numbers are extremely small, but the humans have united. A new group of survivors is emerging in this nightmarish world.... And we aren't afraid to fight dirty, if it ensures our survival.We had to leave Pleasant in order to save our lives. We barely made it out alive. These zombies are entirely different than the ones from television. They are fast, preternaturally strong, and even aware. They used that awareness to discover our small group of survivors. Without Kellan, we'd be dead right now, wandering the streets of Pleasant.Kellan is something completely different than any man I've ever seen before. He's too powerful and too controlled to ever be anything like the average male. I can't explain him, but I'm glad he's on our side. Heaven help us all, if he ever decides we're not worth the effort.He's taken us to his home outside of town, if the massive fortress can be considered that. It's large enough for many more than us, self-sustaining should we be forced to remain behind the high fence. There's something strange about the way he was so prepared for the zombie apocalypse, but it's not my place to question it. I've learned that Kellan doesn't enjoy questions, and he doesn't want anybody getting too close.I'm leaving a handwritten map here in the hopes that there is still someone alive in this town to find it. God, I hope you are. It feels like we're the only ones left, and it's horrifying...Tabitha AlexanderCheck out book two - Phase Two: Evaluate", "title": "Phase One: Identify\n      \n          (Territory of the Dead #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21735480-phase-one", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1399339733l/21735480.jpg", "reviews": 31, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7033186.Rose_Wynters", "name": "Rose Wynters"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Young Adult", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21735480-phase-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17903004-phase-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23594872-phase-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19154990-my-wolf-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18392983-my-wolf-protector", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17732928-rubenesque-rapture", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23002877-my-wolf-fighter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22083883-phase-two"]}
