The bond between Lou and Steve is so beautiful and it's plainly obvious how much this man cherishes his dog Lou. As a massive canine lover this amazing story made me laugh and cry. Crying is probably not descriptive enough, I bawled for days over this book.. It's a story that will remain with me for the rest of my life. It's always good to know that there are others out there that cherish these beautiful souls as much as I do!"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1519524-kim", "userReview": "3.5 stars.

I loved it. And I believe that Lou was quite an exceptional dog. My first dog was a collie who \u201cput down\u201c any squabbles in the same method as Lou does. Lou seems like an extraordinary dog when it comes to learning. it is obvious that he totally bonded with Duno. We dog lovers know what lengths our dogs will go to to please us. The fact that Lou was just so savvy about other dogs; their attitudes, their fears and what to do in each case is remarkable. Maybe part of the comes from the fact that he was a semi-feral dog in his first months and let his intuition rain free of any human interference.The only problem (and it\u2019s a huge problem.) I had with this book and this author, was that he let Lou Lou suffer not only pain but terrible indignation for far too long. It is so very selfish and such a horrible thing to sacrifice your wonderful dog\u2019s attributes for your own selfish, unrealistic desires. No, we don\u2019t put down humans for many of these problems, but when we have have to let a loved one suffer through months of debilitating pain and the loss of all dignity when there is no hope, because of the law, I believe it\u2019s a terrible, terrible thing. How many of us humans pray to never have to die in such away?Now, for some come comments I made while reading the book. There are quite a few but you could always just stop.Page 56\u2026 I let these night deposits lie, partially for the difficulty of fishing them out, but mostly because I knewthe rats were attracted to feces. No dog owner should ever ever let their dogs feces lie, let alone, to purposely attract rats. For one thing, a child or teen may step in it and you\u2019ve made a future politician anti-dog. For another thing who wants more rats? Not right for any reason. Nasty!Always beware, no matter where you are, people steal dogs and usually it\u2019s for nefarious reasons. In this case, a big, husky dog could be turned in to a vicious killer by continued, extreme crurlity. There are many people who fight dogs out there. Horrible, horrible fate.\u201cHe\u2019d protected me and shown what he is capable off\u2026\u201cI will never forget many years ago my large, sweet, love-everybody collie reared up, when my brother-in-law, as a silly kid, jumped out from between trees to scare us. Satin laid his paws on the chest of nearly 6 foot Lars and stopped with just 6 inches between soft neck and flashing teeth. Thank goodness for that courage and judgment.\u201cTo this day I regret not going...\u201d Is is something we all should remember. Of course, we don\u2019t want to put ourselves or others in harms way but so often we regret the things we didn\u2019t do. The \u201cchances of a lifetime\u201c that we passed on. Those are the ones we remember, with regret. \u201cWhen Colleen looked at you she looked right at you, unblinking, taking in what you had to say, analyzing it, then answering without facade \u2026\u201d. Other than the unblinking stare, I\u2019m really going to try to listen to people this way. \u201cWhen the old marine broke down, Lou went to him, rested his head in the man\u2019s lap, and looked up at him with compassion.\u201cOh Shep, Shep,\u201che sobbed rubbing lose head over and over, where are you\u2018s faces from long ago now sharp and clear,...\u201dI experienced this miracle between our elder citizens and my dog, Katy, when I worked as a volunteer for a hospice, Vitas. It is a miracle. And beyond rewarding for the dog owner.Yes, a dog like Lou should definitely have been bred, but if he wasn\u2019t going to be bred they should have neutered him much earlier. Neutering prevents a lot of cancers. Lou\u2019s a lucky dog.Yes. Pure breeds are not necessarily better and often worse in temperament & health issues than our lovable mutts. The fact that these dog shows applaud the cutting off of tails and the docking of ears for no purpose other than tradition, sullies them in my eyes. Dog shows have turned into nothing but another way for elitists to strut their stuff.I know over-doing some situations make the story better, but just to set things straight\u2026 In Pittsburgh we have fairly decent winter weather. A lot of the big snows are funneled around us because of the Allegheny Mountains. We may get one or two a year that necessitate the high boots but last time The snowfall came to my waist I was three. The problem is the East Coast. Bigger snow, more ice\u2026 Danger!"}, {"userName": "Paul Pessolano", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877713-paul-pessolano", "userReview": "First off, this is a true story and the \"dog dies at the end\", but this should not keep one from reading a truly marvelous book. Yhere are just too many good things in this book that will awe any animal lover.Steve Duno and his girl friend were on a short trip in California when they pulled over to the side of the road when they spotted a German Shepherd and her brood. They quickly ran into the woods. Steve whistled and a lone pup came out and went to their side. It was then that they saw the father, a Rottweiler that was feeding on a deer carcass.The pup was flea infested and had a nasty cut from barb wire on its neck. Steve was convinced by his girl friend to take the dog.The dog, now named \"Lou\", had some learning to do. The first time that Steve left the house, for only five minutes, Lou proceeded to rip the entire rug up from the living room floor, destroy a door, and a window.Through a lot of trial and error a dog emerged that was not only faithful, loyal, and loving, but one who seemed to have some exceptional qualities.Lou during his long life, was able to foil a convenience store robbery, attack a rapist, and fought off coyotes, and kidnappers.His grestest achievements though may well have come in the area of working with children, the elderly, and dogs, especially dogs that may have been destined for euthanasia. Lou helped children overcome their fear of dogs, gave the elderly comfort, and brought unruly dogs back under control.Steve and Lou became inseparable friends over their 16 years together and in the heart wrenching ending Steve looks over their life together and is faced with the dilemma of living withour this marvelous dog.Sad? Yes, but there is so much good in this book that it is worth the two boxes of Kleenex."}, {"userName": "Eva Leger", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336770-eva-leger", "userReview": "What do I think? I think I should have reviewed this right away upon finishing instead of waiting until I read another three books. I think Duno should have ditched the 'extraordinary' angle. It's almost offensive. Lou isn't unique in the sense Duno describes. There are plenty, plenty, plenty, plenty of dogs (and other animals) in this world that, given the right chance, will do just the same thing(s) Lou here did. Now, I'm not trying to take away from Lou in any way. Lou was indeed a fantastic dog it seems. But he was not extraordinary. I think Duno's love for him got in the way here. I didn't get the whole 'going to a breeder to buy a dog' thing after rescuing Lou. Did he not understand about other dogs in need of rescuing? I'm not saying anyone who goes to a breeder is a bad person but really? I went to a breeder. Before I knew about rescuing, when I was younger. Every animal we've owned since then, besides two turtles, has been rescued. (No, I don't think I'm better than anyone else but I do think that breeding is borderline - maybe not borderline - irresponsible with all of the strays and adoptable animals in this country and the world.) Anyway, unless I'm remembering wrong, Duno didn't know for sure that Lou came from \"guard dogs on a hidden marijuana patch\". Hearing this from someone standing on the side of the road isn't really the making of facts most times. But whatever. It lends to the 'extraordinary' angle. Duno says in the book that he \"regrets\" not freezing Lou's sperm. (I'm serious, deadly serious.) So, because Lou was just so gosh darn extraordinary let's forget all about the thousands upon thousands upon thousands of other awesome and fantastic dogs and let's breed some more. Yes. Definitely an awesome way to honor Lou's memory. Now, it may sound like I didn't enjoy this book. I did. I just knocked out the extraordinary bit. I think Duno thought another dog book about a regular old dog wouldn't sell so he came up with this. (Just about anyone can make their dog look the same. My Lab knows, by estimation, right around the same amount of words Lou knew and if Duno can take a rumor and sell it as fact as to where Lou came from I can turn my story into something extraordinary also.) What Duno forgot though, it seems, is that a dog lover will love a good dog story (if it's well written) about ANY dog. He doesn't have to be extraordinary. Hence the genre selling so well. I was pleased to read about the publisher for the book Duno was writing because apparently Duno and a friend were going to put Lou and a wolf on the cover of the book. Not a bad idea right? Pretty cool even. But the publisher was scared it would promote wolf owning. I hadn't thought of that (in my defense this was only a few paragraphs at best) but it is true. It would promote owning a wolf in some dumb idiot out there. It was so nice to hear of a publisher (or anyone) taking the reins there even though the cover would have made a great marketing tool. The best part of the book for me, besides the \"regular old Lou\" parts was when Lou went to the nursing home and bonded with the veteran. I'll even admit that I almost cried when he called Lou 'Shep'. I don't know for sure but I think that this man's Shep was, possibly, the same Shep written about in Always Faithful: A Memoir of the Marine Dogs of WWII by William W. Putney. That Shep, if I remember correctly and I hope I do, was buried in Guam in the Marine cemetery for war dogs. I wish I still had Always Faithful although unless I'm just forgetting I don't think the veteran's name was mentioned in this book and Shep's owner in Always Faithful could have also not been mentioned. Interesting nonetheless, I think. I'd have liked this more but for the few things I mentioned and this has a lot of great reviews. (Not that it's any indicator. I can link a few freaking horrible books with great reviews.) Cut out the extraordinary and enjoy the book the usual way."}, {"userName": "Charlotte Villette", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47909851-charlotte-villette", "userReview": "Lou is a gorgeous Rottweiler cross dog who is much smarter than the average dog. He knew over 100 words and commands through sign language. Steve Duno is a pet behaviorist, whom along with Lou helped hundreds of dogs be rehabilitated back into society, be it from naughty behaviour or just needed some confidence and stop being shy.I will say right off the bat, that this isn't a happy ending book, but Lou lived to be a very good age of 16. The whole book revolves around Steve and Lou's life together, the work they did with children and other dogs. You can tell through out the book that Steve truly loved Lou with all of his heart, and Lou looked up to Steve like an idol.I do think that the book lacked somewhat, since the WHOLE book was about how he trained Lou, so I think that maybe the book could have been shortened down a little, but overall it was still a pretty good read.The ending really had me tearing up at the end, and this is the only book that I have read that has made me tear up.https://lovebookreviewsblog.wordpress..."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7739100-jackie", "userReview": "Just when I think I have heard all of the dog stories there are to tell along comes a gem like this one. The writer lives this story day-to-day and sometimes minute-to-minute. When I wake up in the morning I never know where my day will take me beyond the required tasks at hand but along comes life and it shakes up your well planned day. This is how this story begins - a chance encounter when Steve Duno happened to be at the right time and the right place when he found Lou. Or is it that Lou was at the right time and the right place when he found Steve? I guess I will never know the answer to this one but it doesn't matter because the substance in this story is pure joy and amazement.Who would have thought that a stray dog had the gifts that Lou did and who knew that Steve could train a dog with such patience and insight and be so successful with what he accomplished with his dog Lou?I would never have thought that you could train a dog so well that you could use this same dog to be a mentor to other dogs who seemed to have gotten lost along the way. And I had no idea that one dog could be so many things at once. I didn't know that dogs could be so multidimensional but Lou was. He had layer upon layer of personality and intelligence so that when I got to the end of the book I cried my eyes out because I felt like I had just lost a wonderful friend.I hope you will take a chance on this book.

The author's obvious enthusiasm for his subject is infectious, though, and was just enough to carry me through to the end.

I have a grotesque compulsion to read each and every book, otherwise I feel I'm cheating myself. I'm absolutely a sucker for books about the relationships between dogs and their humans, and though I am about as obsessed with my dog as they come, even I found this book to be a tad heavy-handed. I get the man loved his dog, but every damn paragraph was about how his dog was the fastest, how his dog was the smartest, how his dog was beloved by all. From the photos the dog looks like he was a nice dog, but sheesh, from the way he was described I would have thought he'd have been Adonis incarnate. It was definitely not my favorite read, but I will say that Duno's saving grace was the poignant epilogue he wrote to Lou.
