However what if having this happen to her, makes her a better person? Because when she was Celaena she wasn't that bad. The potential!'with seemingly no hope for escape.' Not for long though! It's Aelin, she can get herself out of anything. 'Without Aelin to protect them, soldier Aedion and shapeshifter Lysandra need to defend their homeland at all costs.' But do you need her really? I think, you can do this.'Also left to forge their own paths in order to change history' How can you change history? But seriously, take this opportunity to forge your own paths, guys take it before she gets back and puts you on her path. 'the fae male Rowan, searches the world over for his lost love' Surely you have something better to do? Like come on mate, you can find another girlfriend in that time, one who will bring you back to the Rowan I used to like before you became Aelin's bitch. Also fae male, I know he's a male, why does that need to be pointed out? If you don't know he's a male by now, it's like mentioned multiple times how can you miss it?'Some ties will bond even tighter together, others will be severed forever' Do not break the ties between Dorian and Chaol. Anyone else is fair game but don't break them up.720 pages? I hope it's not terrible because that's a lot of pages. This is what I need: Aelin to die and then Rowan can't live without her so he offs himself. Dorian finds Chaol and decides to be a fucking king with his best friend by his side. Manon realises she's gay and rejoices with the thirteen and they live happily ever after. The immortal's decide that love dooms you hence with what happened to Rowan and become their badass selves again. And Lysandra takes the throne revealing she was only pretending to be friends with Aelin to take it and I'll be behind her one hundred percent. Aedion will discover his place with his father, not with his awful cousin. Have I missed anyone?Oh yeah Maeve, the immortals fight back and take her down, yeah!Or Aelin survives but while her and Rowan are having sex, instead of palm trees being killed, they are. That would be perfect. This is what will happen:Aelin will save herself and become the worlds worst ruler while Rowan pants at her heels. Manon will lose all her independence and ruthless spirit because dick is everything right? Elide will forgive Lorcan as will Aedion with Lysandra and all the straight couples because everyone gotto be white and straight yeah? will live happily ever after while I gag. Oh and everyone will make it, unfortunately. And there will be loads of cringy worthy, I got to go throw up, sex scenes, I shudder just even thinking about it. But one thing throughout it, I'd be like-bitch die! Save the people from her rule because even Dorian's father would not be as bad as her. No one could ever be, well not as bad as Hilter but close."}, {"userName": "Misstdennis", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41744660-misstdennis", "userReview": "Put it this way...
