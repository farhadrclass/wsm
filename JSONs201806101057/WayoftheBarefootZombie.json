This novel mixes the two main types of zombies (Romero-style flesh eaters and the Hoodoo/Voodoo variety) into one interesting novel with a new take on the subgenre without moving too far away from the bits that most of us zombie people are into.A couple wealthy young adults get a substantial amount of money from their parents to embark on a ceremony known as the Way of the Barefoot Zombie. The ceremony takes place on a secluded island with enough wealth and political connections attached to it to not only keep it off the map but to avoid the prying eyes of those who might not like what they find. Our protagonists have an ulterior motive in their journey; to free the zombie inhabitants of the island.This novel brings us into a world similar to our own, only where flesh eating cadavers walk the earth and are known about by the populace. Although outbreaks occur, they are managed and no pandemic has occurred from them. Aside from that, it appears to be a business as usual version of reality with fat cats who just cannot seam to get fat enough and misguided youth.This novel reads through pretty fast, making it a pleasant read. It also gives a lot of insight and information on the practices of Voodoo and Hoodoo, as well as their connections to Christianity.I felt that one of the main characters was a bit hollow to be honest, but it did not overly affect this story. I suppose not being too character-driven gives some sway in that aspect.All in all, this is a decent read that I recommend to all my fellow zombie enthusiasts out there and on here."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2278513-robert", "userReview": "A brilliantly fun zombie story and satire on management techniques and the global financial crisis.

As it starts out, we are introduced to Benjamin and Tatyana, two trust fund kids who have helped create \"The Zombie Liberation Front\", which is an organization focused on walking in the footsteps of the noble monsters, or zombies, of Haitian Lore. But voodoo zombies are real in this tale and Benjamin and Tayana are off on a mission to free a group of them being used by a wealthy entrepreneur, Doc Papa, who runs a program for the super rich, where they learn the Way of the Barefoot Zombie. In other words, these power brokers are are being trained to act like zombies, who care little about anything except their ravenous goals and they fear nothing. In a screwball way, this book is variation on Z.E.O.: How to Get A(Head) in Business (Zombie Series), where the goal is to become much like a zombie and destroy all your competition in business. Of course, that is just how the story starts out. As Benjamin and Tatyana discover more secrets of the island and try to work their sabotage, they are introduced to Merriam, a powerful voodoo priestess whose intent is to bring Doc Papa down and save the zombies herself, but for her own reasons. There are plenty of twists and turns with lots of strange magic floating around. The zombies in this story are voodoo zombies but the author has kept the hunger for living flesh as a part of their routine. You can act like a zombie around them and not be devoured, but once you start acting human, you are toast. The story picks up speed the further it goes, with quite a bit of voodoo magic flying around. The main characters went from mildly unlikeable spoiled rich kids to legitimate crusaders on a mission. Honestly, after about 100 pages I was not all that intrigued by the story, but another hundred pages into this 311 page book and I found the story to be much more intriguing. There is some gore and some really cringe worthy stuff on these pages(to walk the path of the zombie, you have to act like one and DO what one would do), but the zombie violence is really at a minimum here. Still, the story worked for me because it became interesting and fun to see all the voodoo magic at work and we had the chance to unravel a mystery at the same time. The author obviously has a fascination for voodoo magic and legends, because he is quite knowledgeable on the subject. A traditional Romero zombie fan might find this story to not be to their tastes, but I can always enjoy the occasional voodoo spice to add to my zombie fascination now and then, and this book did the trick. Again, it starts out slow but as it moves along, the story became a much more fun and interesting read."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "In this novel, JB is clever to lampoon the current trend for self-help and how to get rich guides. A nice touch of the voodoo zombie, brings in the atmospheric feelings from the old black and white movies expertly well and sets up the backdrop for the whole sordid story.None of the characters are particularly nice, they all have some sharp edge, shady past dealings or an outright nasty, self-possessed nature, but JB writes about them with such civility you can feel the sarcasm dripping off the pages.An incorporation of some form of a love story element is in most of his novels, this is no different only a little bit more warped than his usual and there are several trysts to choose from.The first two main characters you meet are Ben and Tatyana, rich kids who choose to be \u201cdeath walkers\u201d and members of the Noble Monsters freedom movement; basically, they feel that zombies should be let out into the wild\u2026. We all know how that goes!So off they go in search of the egotistical Doc Papa and his \u201cWay of the Barefoot Zombie\u201d training experience of how to get rich and be top of the food chain in the business world. To get on said training course you need to be super rich and a bit of an a*sehole! This course is set on an isolated island, of course.As expected, Doc Papa has alternative motives and before long we have Voodoo rituals, zombie munching and soul stealing going on. The foil to Doc Papa is Miriam, her place in the story is slightly out of focus at the beginning but soon becomes evident; she is the most likable of all the characters but has her own issues. A character that did stood out for me was Samuel and his unique love encounters, they are peculiar shall we say, but his comeuppance is hysterical! His Narcissism is explained in the best way ever! And\u2026..OMG the eyeball carpet, I still cannot get this visual out of my head! Thanks for that JB!I found the ending a little too bland and sickly sweet for my tastes, but it does tie up all the loose ends. Overall a marvellous read."}, {"userName": "Jenevieve", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5350268-jenevieve", "userReview": "Doc Papa is running a course he calls \"The Way of the Barefoot Zombie\" in which the richest people are invited to come and try to learn how to detach themselves from their emotions in order to do what needs doing to make more money. They learn how to move among zombies safely by imitating them right down to the eating of living human flesh. The course culminates in the removing of the Gros Bon Ange, the higher reasoning part of the soul, through voodoo means and trapping it in a vessel so it can be returned later to argue the person's case to get into heaven unaware of what was done while they were removed.Two of the current crop of students are more than they seem tho, they are members of the Zombie Liberation Front, and mean to set the noble dead free to roam the Earth rather than being used in this fashion. Another is also not as she appears, a voodoo practioner in her own right from the island who had escaped when Doc Papa first came into power. She is back to free the souls of the zombies so they can move on and to take the island back from Doc Papa.An interesting take combining zombies and voodoo (ok, that's not unusual). I found it a bit slow in the beginning but it picked up towards the middle. There were some parts I felt were just thrown in for the ick factor and it could have been just as powerful without and I thought part of the ending was just a little too hokey but otherwise, a decent zombie book."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2009120-christine", "userReview": "I bought this book on a whim one day based on the description the back gave; I thought it sounded just ridiculous enough to be awesome. I can't say I was exactly disappointed in how the story turned out, but it wasn't overwhelmingly great, either.The story starts off kind of slow, setting up the main characters and how they got where they are. Once you get past that, though, the story picks up, and the plan goes awry (doesn't it always?), things start to get more interesting as they learn more about the island and its past. Overall, the story is satisfying, and though the two main characters start off obnoxious, by the end they've grown on you.The real problem with this book, I found, was actually the editing. Misspelled words, misplaced or missing punctuation, incorrect capitalization were all commonplace. I can usually ignore one or two typos in a novel; hey, it happens, you can't catch everything. But I was finding several typos a chapter. No, it doesn't detract from the story, but it's distracting (if you notice that kind of thing) and breaks your focus."}, {"userName": "Batsap", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2655403-batsap", "userReview": "Loved the concept of this, but wasn't very impressed by the execution. The characters were flat and immature, their motives over-simplified. The worst part for me was the introduction of the Zombie Liberation Front because the interaction between them was awkward and unbelievable to the point of making it painful to read. The book did pick up towards the second half of the book though, and all the details about Voodoo were interesting."}, {"userName": "Amaris Skye", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2364112-amaris-skye", "userReview": "3.5/5I keep forgetting to write my reviews when I finish a book so I don't have I fully accurate feel of how the book impacted me.
