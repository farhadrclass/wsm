I hope you get the gist.Ever since I was a little kid, any mention of pioneers drew me in. Apparently I am still that same girl that becomes rapt with attention at the mention of anything from the \u201colden days\u201d. I rarely read entire synopsis's of books since I feel that they often give way too much away, so when picking out books I read the back page's descriptions of books only until the very second where it catches my interest and then I jump in. So needless to say I didn't really know what to expect when I opened this book apart from it having something to do with Little House on the Prairie.Well the result was that I could not put this book down, I found the main character's life so interesting, although that statement might be somewhat ironic since the mc is always going on about how she doesn't have a life. I suppose this just means that I have -life.This is one of those books that's not really about much, I kind of feel that perhaps that is an unfair definition of this book, but the main plot is not exactly pulse racing material. It is slow and for me, I felt that it was more of a glimpse into a regular person's life rather than an over the top fable.However I enjoy these types of books, and I am pretty patient with slow paced books (as long as they are written well, which this on is). The writing was perfection and I would definitely read more from this author.Buy, Borrow or Bin Verdict: Buy ( if you don't mind slower paced books)Note #2: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Donovan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25800921-jennifer-donovan", "userReview": "Fans of Little House on the Prairie, owners of the boxed set (either pale blue like mine or pale yellow if you are a bit younger than I), as I am, will be charmed by parts of this book.I was. But it wasn't quite enough. In fact, the memoir The Wilder Life: My Adventures in the Lost World of Little House on the Prairie gave me those same feelings, but in a more cohesive unit. This \"novel\" felt derivative of that.I put novel in quotes because it really reads like a memoir, from the long ambling passages about life in the Chinese buffet business, to her scholarly research, I kept wondering \"How much of this is real?\" But because it wasn't firmly in either camp, I think the structure suffered.Fans of memoir -- as I am -- might like it. Fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder and/or Rose Wilder Lane will enjoy sharing the pages with a fellow fan. The story about Lee, a Vietnamese doctoral candidate, struggling between family roots and living her own life, is interesting as well. The secondary characters like her mother, brother, and grandfather, are well drawn.I am hovering between 2 and 3 stars. For me, it was ultimately somewhat unsatisfying and I felt it straddled the genres of fiction and memoir without enough clarification. Even though it is written and sold as fiction, it feels very much like a project memoir, and I felt that discoveries made within the novel should have been clarified at the end. Most historical fiction that I've read that deals with real people will clarify what is based on fact or folklore and what is pure speculation.*I received a copy of this book for review purposes*"}, {"userName": "Jaylia3", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3", "userReview": "If this intriguing layered novel only told the family focused story of Lee Lien, a book-nerdy young woman with an on-hold academic career trying to straddle the contrasting cultures and conflicting expectations of modern America, where she was born, and traditional pre-war Vietnam, where her strong-willed mother and gracious grandfather spent the earlier parts of their lives, that would have been enough to capture my interest. If instead Pioneer Girl was simply a literary mystery, with Lee Lien so obsessed by a book related incident that may connect her family\u2019s former Saigon restaurant to the author(s) of the Little House on the Prairie series that she chases clues across the country, from dusty library shelves to colorfully painted San Francisco neighborhoods, even abandoning her normally somewhat passive upright nature long enough to slip archival materials into her handbag, I\u2019d make sure to get my hands on a copy. But Pioneer Girl is both books, and talk about obsessed, I couldn\u2019t put it down. This isn\u2019t the kind of mystery with dead bodies or definite answers, but that just made this coming of age quest all the more intriguing."}, {"userName": "Mauoijenn ~ *Mouthy Jenn* ~", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2569271-mauoijenn-mouthy-jenn", "userReview": "This was a cute book with ties to The Little House on the Prarie.

There is a lot of repetition-- she fights with her mother and loses, she fights with her brother and loses, she thinks about her family history, but never digs too deeply. Lien (a thinly fictionalized version of the author) delves into the story of Rose Wilder Lane, the daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Nguyen here retreads old scholars, particularly the author of The Ghost in the Little House. There is nothing really new or interesting here if you are familiar with the story behind the story of the Little House books. The exception here is that Nguyen is extremely biased, painting Laura as a cold withholding mother and Rose as a creative genius, stifled by her mother's worldview. In reality, Rose was bipolar and Laura most likely had to deal with her daughter's wild mood swings, along with Rose's shopping addiction (this was during the Great Depression when money was particularly scarce). Nguyen touches on and then dismisses these facts, choosing instead to focus on Lee Lien's cold mother and drawing parallels between her and Laura. But, sketchy historical facts aside, what frustrated me the most about this book is Lien's journey. She travels the United States aimlessly, has sexual relationships that mean nothing and lead nowhere, and remains unchanged by the end of her journey. No conclusions are drawn by her research into Rose or her own family. In the end, she ends up wandering again into a pointless job that will lead nowhere, fighting with her family without getting answers, and remaining unchanged in her identity. She learns nothing and remains unchanged. Because of this, the book is extremely disappointing and seemed pointless by the time I reached the end. It's a shame because the premise of the book was wonderful, but it tried to be too much and in the end it lead nowhere."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "An interesting look at second generation immigrants from Viet Nam.

They went from one place in the Midwest to another and Lee and her brother Sam disdained their way of life.Lee, after a story her grandfather told about Rose Wilder Lane and a piece of jewelry she left in their place of business in Vietnam, starts piecing together the life of Laura and Rose. I never read the LIttle House on the prairie books but I found her research and the many paths and places this took her, to be fascinating. All set to give this four stars but than when she meets Gregory something happens that I found predictable and stereotypical, did not feel it was at all necessary to the story and the aftermath included some awkward dialogue. So for me this derailed the storing bit. Still it is an very good piece of work and the revelations and discussion about these literary icons were fascinating.The book does make me want to read The LIttle House on the Prairie books. Very easy to read, flows right along, a good blending of the immigrant experience, family and research."}, {"userName": "Jolene", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4914094-jolene", "userReview": "**Thank you Penguin and Netgalley for providing this in exchange for an honest review**3.5 StarsLee is a second generation Vietnamese American who is trying to find her place in the world. She has recently finished her PhD, and like many recent graduates of her generation, can't find employment. After awhile, she admits defeat and returns home. While this never part of anyone's plan, most people would receive a sense of comfort from returning. Most people would receive support from their parents. They would be returning to home, a safe place where they can be themselves and know they would be accepted. Unfortunately, home doesn't feel that way for Lee. Her mother is a first generation Vietnamese American and still lives by many of the traditions and rules of her mother country. She puts her son up on a pedestal, while Lee feels she is treated like a second class child because she is the second child, and even worse, a girl. Her brother, Sam, is given cars, money, and one day will be given whatever business their mother happens to own at the time. All this even though Sam has repeatedly stolen from their mother and leaves the family without warning. Even though Lee and her mother have a rocky, at best, relationship, Lee has always tried to do right for her family. The one saving grace for her at home is her Ong Hai. He has always showed her love, respect, and support. He has always tried to keep the household as peaceful as possible. He understands why his daughter can't let go of the traditions she grew up with, but he also understands why they make Lee feel trapped.Ong Hai is the one who plants the seed that will begin Lee on her journey. In 1965, Ong Hai owned at cafe called Cafe 88 in Saigon. One day, a American women steps in the cafe. Her name was Rose, and she was a reporter sent to write about the war from a women's perspective. Ong Hai is delighted when the women continues to return to hear more of his stories. On her last visit, Rose leaves a gold pin behind. Ong Hai saves the pin, but Rose never returns for it. The pin is one of the few things Ong Hai and Lee's mother bring with them to America. It is this little pin that will send Lee on here back and forth journey to find out the true history of the pin, and maybe find her self along the way.Ok, confession time. I have never read any of the Little House on the Prairie books or watched the show. I vaguely remember reading parts of Farmer Boy in 4th grade class and it boring me to tears. I never felt the urge to seek out anything to do with the series after that. I might have liked the story more if I had, but even as a non-LHotP fan, I still enjoyed it. My sister is going through the same thing as Lee profession wise. She has just completed her Masters (is going for PhD), and she can't find anything out there. She is still working as a waitress and has had to return home a few times when tips just weren't paying the bills. I can easily see Lee's frustration and the little amounts of defeat Lee feels every time my sister has to turn home. You spend years going on almost no sleep just so you can go to college and work. You're always tired, stressed, and just one frozen burrito away from a mini-freak out. And what do you have to show for it when you graduate? You're back home working at the same restaurant you were at before all of it. It was really easy for me to connect with Lee because of that. I can't imagine how someone could deals with the normal stress of college life along with the added cultural pressures some second generation Americans must receive from their families.Well worth the read. I really enjoyed Nguyen's storytelling and plan to read her Short Girls novel soon."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly", "userReview": "After reading the Little House books last summer, it really made me wonder if those books had meaning to girls who weren't middle class and white Americans. And that's sort of at the premise of this book, though this is about a woman who has just completed her PhD and begins to see the ways her life mirrors much of Rose Wilder, Laura's mother. Lee is Vietnamese American who finds herself back at home helping her mother and grandfather run the family restaurant. She dreams of finding her way out and making a claim of her own, and it's through a story she invents about Rose Wilder and a pin her family received from a traveler back in Vietnam that sets her off to establish her own. What I loved most about this book is how much it read like a memoir. It was hard to remember it's fiction and not real, but Nguyen is a master of voice and perspective here. The parallels are well-drawn, and while I don't think this one has huge appeal for general teen YA readers, certainly those with a love for the Little House books or well-done, well-paced literary fiction that doesn't get self-indulgent will find a lot here to enjoy.My first Nguyen read won't be my last."}, {"userName": "Renae (Romantic Parvenu)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4620632-renae-romantic-parvenu", "userReview": "I honestly thought Pioneer Girl was nonfiction; I really did. Somehow the very clear \u201ca novel\u201d printed on the front cover of the book escaped me completely. Imagine my surprise to find that, though this book has all the trappings of a memoir, Bich Minh Nguyen actually telling a quite made-up story. It took me a little while to realize that, but once it did, my approach and perspective in reading this book shifted dramatically.Because, what I thought was going to be an investigative look into Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s life was more of a comparison, a parallel, between one Vietnamese immigrant woman\u2019s life and that of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Nguyen draws comparisons between the two stories that capture something of the American spirit, regardless of race or century, and it\u2019s a really interesting way to look at things, once I quite liked.Of course, my favorite aspects of Pioneer Girl were the commentary on how the Little House books are so drastically different from the realities of Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s life. That\u2019s always been a point of extreme interest to me, and I thought the author did a good job of speaking to that without turning this into an info-dumpy recapping of how sanitized the Little House books really were.However, Laura Ingalls is not the protagonist of this book. Lee Lien, a recently graduated PhD student, is. Without a tenure-track teaching position (or really any teaching position at all), she winds up living with her mother and grandfather, Vietnamese immigrants who\u2019ve recently opened their own cafe after years of wandering around the Midwest. She rediscovers a gold pin in her mother\u2019s jewelry box that as a child she thought bore remarkable significance to one that Almanzo Wilder reportedly gave as a gift to his fianc\u00e9e, Laura Ingalls. And from there, Lee sets off on a \u201cliterary mystery\u201d, delving deep into Rose Wilder Lane\u2019s life, going from Iowa to Missouri to California in search of the truth.Pioneer Girl is very much a novel of discovery and identity, and I think Nguyen handled the dual storylines (Lee\u2019s and Rose\u2019s) very well. Though seemingly as unalike as possible, both women have much in common, and the author intertwines their narrative threads with a lot of skill and believability. Though I must admit to being sad and more than a bit disappointed that Rose Wilder Lane never did leave a family heirloom on a cafe table in Saigon, or had a son out of wedlock that she adopted out. Pioneer Girl, with its pseudo-memoir narrative, tells such a good tale that the reader really wants it to be true, even if it\u2019s mostly made-up.For me, Pioneer Girl was a cleverly-written and insightful book that bridges the gap between fiction and nonfiction, and draws surprising comparisons between two very disparate American subcultures. Bich Minh Nguyen did an excellent job with the novel altogether, and I think Pioneer Girl not only cements my appreciation for Laura Ingalls Wilder, but also gives me new contexts to view her legacy in."}, {"userName": "Morris", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32911939-morris", "userReview": "\u201cPioneer Girl\u201d is an absolutely wonderful novel about a Vietnamese woman born to immigrant parents in the 1970s.As a child, Lee Lien was obsessed with the Little House on the Prairie books as she and her family moved from place to place, looking for a better life. As an adult, she begins to trail a story that goes back to her mother\u2019s childhood in Saigon. The search for the full story makes for a wonderful literary mystery that would be enough to make a good read on its own. However, there is much more.Soon Lee, and the reader, begins to connect the lives of her family with those of the Wilders. The search for a better life is something that spans all cultures and generations, and never has book so captured the American Dream as eloquently as \u201cPioneer Girl\u201d. It is something unchanging, and will hopefully be embraced and extended to all of those yet to come.

More diverse books are desperately needed, and this is an excellent addition toward that goal of universal diversity. Thank you to the author for your work.I recommend \u201cPioneer Girl\u201d.

Her relationship with her mother is frosty at best, yet her beloved grandfather always finds a way to smooth things over. The family's latest restaurant, the Lotus Leaf, has a steady string of customers, and Lee is more than ready to try a few changes, switch things around in an attempt to really get business booming. The Liens' world comes to a halt with the unexpected return of Sam, Lee's brother. As the oldest (and the male), Sam is the golden child, the one who is set to inherit the restaurant (whether he wants it or not), and his actions are always forgiven. In his mother's eyes he can do no wrong. So when he empties the cash register - and his mother's jewelry box - to start a new life out west, Mrs. Lien cleans the entire house and waits for the day when he'll return.With Sam's departure, Lee discovers a token he left behind for her: a small pin from a lifetime ago in Vietnam. Since she was a child, Lee has heard her mother and grandfather tell stories about their cafe in Saigon and how they were visited by a nice American woman. Whether she purposefully left the pin behind they can't say, but it has remained with them decades later, making the trip to America and a new life. As Lee digs deeper into the pin's story, she uncovers a hidden history that could potentially link her family to Laura Ingalls Wilder.I had been looking forward to Pioneer Girl since I first heard about it last year and I'm thrilled to say it did not disappoint! In fact, it exceeded all expectations and then some! Essentially there are two stories in this novel: Lee's and Rose's. When I read novels where the focus is on multiple characters, I usually find myself preferring one over the other but I'm pleased to say that was not the case in Pioneer Girl. I was as invested in Lee's story as I was in Rose Wilder Lane's and because of that, I wound up breezing through the book much quicker than I would have liked (this is a novel to be slowly savored).As interesting as Lee's family was, Rose was an equally fascinating woman in her own right. Prior to Pioneer Girl I had a rough idea of who the Wilder family was and what The Little House on the Prairie series was all about. Somehow I managed to skip these books as a child, but Pioneer Girl piqued my interest. Especially with the rumors that Rose was actually the writer, not Laura, and that Rose would fudge details and expand upon anecdotes for the sake of a good story. She even demanded that Laura write solely in third person in their letters!Despite being a history buff (and spending many elementary school computer classes playing Oregon Trail), I tend to see the Old West and prairie life through rose-colored glasses. While reading Pioneer Girl it became all too evident that times were hard - if not downright brutal - for pioneers. Rose was the only child of the Wilders to survive to adulthood and she herself lost her only child after a few days. Her relationship with Laura was hardly affectionate and she wound up leaving home to make it on her own in a city. Rose married for sex and divorced the man a few years later, determined to lead an independent life. As her journalism career took off, Rose traveled the world - most notably to Vietnam where she covered the war in the 1960s. Her vocal political stance took on a life of its own and she's now considered to be one of the founders of the American Libertarian Movement, along with Ayn Rand.If I could go back and read Pioneer Girl all over again (I definitely see a re-read of this book in the future!) I would take my time with it and really sink into this world of Vietnamese cuisine and farmsteads. Nguyen doesn't have many books to her name at this point: Short Girls and a memoir entitled Stealing Buddha's Dinner, but they're now on my radar and I can't wait to track down my own copies! Whether you're looking for diversity (her novels feature Vietnamese families and culture) or simply want a good book, Bich Minh Nguyen is an author to keep your eye on."}, {"userName": "Trish at Between My Lines", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15939692-trish-at-between-my-lines", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Between My LinesHands up, I have to admit that I ADORE The Little House on the Prairie- both the books and the TV show.\u00a0 I read these with my mother and they are the ultimate in comfort books for me.\u00a0 So as soon as I saw Pioneer Girl, I knew I needed it in my paws!\nFirst Line of Pioneer Girl by Bich Minh Nguyen\n\u201cIn August 1965 a woman named Rose walked into my granfather\u2019s cafe in Saigon.\u201d\nMy Thoughts on Pioneer Girl by Bich Minh Nguyen:\nThere are three things you need to know about this book:  I loved it! \n   It doesn\u2019t have the innocent, warm feel that Little House gives you \n   It is fiction \n   OK, with all that clear, let me tell you a bit more about it.\u00a0 It features Lee who is second-generation Vietnamese American and the possible connections between her family and Rose Wilder Lane (Laura\u2019s daughter to the uninitiated).\u00a0 She also illustrates the similarities between the families such as the constant moving around, the ongoing search for a better life and the mother/daughter tensions.What I adored while reading this was how diverse and authentic it felt.\u00a0 I was hooked by how displaced Lee felt and how much she just wanted to fit in.\u00a0 It felt like such a struggle and it really made me think long and hard about how displaced and unsettled it might feel to be a second-generation immigrant.I also loved how the facts about Little House and the Ingalls history meshed in with the story.\u00a0 It does read a bit like a memoir as you are mixing in factual history with fictional but it really worked for me.\u00a0 I was absorbed in the facts and by how Lee set about researching the links.\u00a0 I have to say she isn\u2019t exactly a squeaky clean character and definitely does some shady things during her research but I loved how passionate she was about it all.I have already read a lot about Laura Ingalls so nothing in the book came as a shock to me.\u00a0 It does strongly imply however that Rose had a lot to do with the writing/editing of those books which is something I firmly believe.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t like or are unaware of that view though, some of the story might dismay you.The other aspect I love was the rocky relationship that Lee has with her mother and brother.\u00a0 I can see why she got obsessed with Little House and it\u2019s depictions of the ideal American family.\u00a0 As this is what she longed to be part of.Lee is a very unique character and her darker moments shake up the pace of the book.\u00a0 Her mother was very alien to me and difficult to comprehend but I enjoyed how complex she was.\u00a0 And you have to love Ong Hai, her peace-making grandfather.\u00a0 \u00a0I was also partial to the huge theme of food, yum!\u00a0 I want Ong Hai to cook for me!So overall this book is NOTHING like Little House on the Prairie and the reasons I picked it up had nothing to do with how I ultimately enjoyed it.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The huge pluses for me were the character development, the diversity of it and only then The Little House tie-ins.\u00a0 And I know I want to read more by this author as I loved how she brought this Vietnamese family to life for me.\u00a0 Not in a superficial way but in a way that helped me understand the culture and consider other perspectives.\u00a0\u00a0\nWho should read Pioneer Girl by Bich Minh Nguyen?\nI\u2019d highly recommend this book to you if you are looking for an authentically diverse main character and a story that makes you think about the challenges of immigration.\u00a0 If you love Little House, just be aware that this is not similar to that but I still adored the Little House tie-ins.Thanks to NetGalley and Penguin Books for giving me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50448-becky", "userReview": "At first, I wanted to love Pioneer Girl. I then settled for wanting to like it. It has an interesting premise: A Vietnamese coming-of-age story with a Little House connection. Lee grew up reading the Little House books. She may not want to admit to liking or loving the TV show, but, the books she loves, has always loved. Her parents came from Vietnam to America in the 1970s. She was born and raised in the Midwest. Her parents, particularly her mother and her grandfather, were almost always in the restaurant business: managing bad buffets mostly. The older she got the more she wanted to distance herself. So where is the connection to Laura Ingalls Wilder?! Well, her grandfather brought a gold pin with him to America. It was a pin that had belonged to an older woman, a white woman, a reporter doing a story on the war. Lee, as an adult, is convinced that woman was Rose Wilder Lane. Furthermore, she has a feeling that the pin is *the* pin described in These Happy Golden Years, a gift from Almanzo to Laura. The novel also introduces a \"what-if\" mystery. The book drifts between her structured thoughts on Laura Ingalls Wilder, Rose Wilder Lane, and the Little House books AND her own meaningless (at least in the moment as she sees it) life. She's a twenty-something young woman, still sorta in school, but wanting to find something more in life: a good job would be nice, but validation maybe that she's made it. Lots of family drama. Bit of angst. These two focuses connect now and then. Lee travels and does research. Or should I just call it what it is: theft. The BIG, BIG, BIG problem I have with the novel is Lee herself. Lee goes to a library with a special research collection: Lee steals a photograph from the collection. Lee goes to a museum: Lee not only breaks the rules and enters rooms she's not supposed to enter at all, but, she steals more stuff. A letter. A first edition book with scribbles/notes from Rose. Does she have a guilty conscience? No! In fact, she's proud and thinks herself the cleverest of all. I exaggerate perhaps. But the fact that she does think herself super-clever and is proud of what she's done and tells of her exploits says something about her character. Pioneer Girl is a new adult novel. It's a thoughtful novel, reflective in places. Lee poses a good question now and then, seeking insight into deeper matters. But the book left me unsatisfied."}, {"userName": "Paige", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/724491-paige", "userReview": "4, maybe even 4.5.I saw this book at the university library when I was looking for a different book. I was drawn by the cover--I\u00a0loved the artwork on it. I didn't actually check it out because the jacket copy tied it so intimately to\u00a0Little House on the Prairie, and I read one of those book as a kid, but I was like, how much do I really care about someone's ties to that book? But the next time I was in the library it still seemed to be calling to me, so I went ahead and checked it out.I'm really glad I did. I liked this book quite a bit. It's a story\u00a0narrated by a second-generation Vietnamese woman whose parents and grandparent fled the war in Vietnam to come to the US. She's an academic--or trying to be; finishing her dissertation isn't going so well, and she hasn't had any job offers. So she moves back in with her mom and grandfather who run a small Vietnamese restaurant. When her brother comes back for a short visit, trying to find some mysterious money that he claims his mom owes them, she falls into this\u00a0Little House storyline, discovering what might be connections of her family with theirs.The book reads like a memoir and I was kind of having an\u00a0Inception moment because she's studying someone else's memoir-ish writing, and reading their journals, and it made me think about my own journaling. The whole thing is pretty understated. It only has like 3.35 stars on Goodreads, which is kind of a low rating, and I wonder if that's part of the reason why. It feels very realistic and doesn't have any huge overarching plots or overtly satisfying character arcs, but because of that it felt very real and true-to-life for me. I did find it pretty engrossing, but in reality I guess it was kind of \"slow\" or \"unexciting.\" But I thought it worked really well; the tone, the pacing, the story, the characters, they all worked together well.I found the book to be a pretty interesting snapshot. It's also pretty short, at only 296 pages of largish print and largish line spacing. It was easy to read and felt very realistic. I could definitely go for more of this kind of book/story."}, {"userName": "Kelly Hager", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1436215-kelly-hager", "userReview": "THIS BOOK.You remember that fairly recently I mainlined my way through the Little House on the Prairie books which, somehow, I managed to not read as a child. This book managed to bring the delight of that back.Granted, it's more about Lee's life and family but there are obviously a lot of parts that deal with Laura Ingalls Wilder and her daughter, Rose. This book is so smart and funny and touching, and I absolutely loved Lee.I love the idea that you could somehow find a connection in your life to books that are so important to you---and actual connections, not just \"Oh, I love this book and this other person loves this book so clearly we are bashert.\" I mean that you could somehow find an artifact from a book in your own life. But that's like that Cornelia Funke series, right? Inkheart? Well, not in this book.But, like I said earlier, the thing that makes this book so amazing is the fact that Lee seems like someone we know. She has complicated relationships with her family and isn't entirely sure she's on the right career path. And then she stumbles across this mystery that has a direct connection to her life, and it's like it reinvigorates her.This book is a perfect surprise in the best way.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Margaret Sullivan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5433333-margaret-sullivan", "userReview": "I must be really dumb, because it took me a third of this book to figure out that it was fiction, despite \"A NOVEL\" right there on the cover.

This is an imaginative conception of how the world of the child of Vietnamese immigrants could intersect with that of the uber-American Little House books.

I had never heard of it, stumbled on it by chance, and thoroughly enjoyed it.Many of its themes and plot points have been explored before, to be sure. Burning out of academia; boomeranging to your childhood home. Relationships between strait-laced sisters and drifter brothers; between stubborn mothers and stubborn daughters; between Midwesterners and coastal city dwellers; between older immigrants in America and their more Americanized children and grandchildren. (One element you might be surprised not to see much, however, is romance. The narrator ponders a friend-with-benefits situation and meets another man later through her research, but no love triangle emerges. Fine by me! Nothing against romantic drama; I just don\u2019t think every book needs it!) Anyway, as I said, Pioneer Girl might hit some familiar notes \u2013 but there are reasons they have such wide appeal. Besides, Bich Minh Nguyen combines them all creatively.Central to Pioneer Girl is the irresistible message that your favorite books can help you empathize with individuals whose lives are entirely unlike yours. In this case, the avid reader is Lee Lien, an erstwhile literary scholar begrudgingly working at her mother\u2019s caf\u00e9 while between adjunct teaching gigs. The beloved work is Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s Little House series, originally conceived as a less-child-friendly memoir called Pioneer Girl (get it?). As Lee and presumably most of us adult readers are aware, Wilder had at least some writing assistance (exactly how much, we will never know but will still debate) from her daughter, then-famous novelist and journalist Rose Wilder Lane. Lee revisits her childhood favorite when she discovers a possible link between her Vietnamese-American family and Lane. As she delves into this literary mystery, she clarifies her own career and life goals.If I have to add qualifiers, I\u2019ll say Pioneer Girl\u2019s dialogue might be a little clunky at times. Additionally, it seems like a slight cop-out that Rose Wilder Lane\u2019s political beliefs are never mentioned -- surely Lee would have her own opinions about them and how they seeped into the Little House books. But these are just quibbles. Other reviewers have made a more substantial criticism that I suspect was actually intentional on the author\u2019s part: there are often easier solutions to Lee\u2019s dilemmas, yes, but she does everything the roundabout way for a reason. Subconsciously, she wanted and needed to have an adventure and break a few rules."}, {"userName": "Heidi ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416888-heidi", "userReview": "I love a surprise, especially when one appears between the pages of a book. First\u2014 a confession. Like the main character Lee, the Little House on the Prairie books were some of the first I read... or more like devoured. I still remember receiving the first one for my 8th birthday. I think my mom wanted to encourage a shy young girl to read more. She had no idea that books would become, and remain, that child\u2019s number one occupation. And for that I am forever grateful. Oh the countless happy hours I spent reading about Ma, Pa, Half-pint and the 19th century Midwest, or reenacting all those Prairie moves in a wagon with any kid who would play Little House inspired make-believe with me. Which is why this book was such a lovely surprise. I could not imagine a story about a second generation young Vietnamese-American woman (and millennial) and the vagabond life of Rose Wilder Lane and her mother, Laura Ingalls Wilder could so seamlessly be interwoven and yet it worked wonderfully. Maybe because my own life shares similarities with Lee, Rose and Laura, I enjoyed every page. Every anecdote, and more importantly, every realization about familial relationships and unresolved conflict that becomes acceptance and understanding, rather than resolution. And moving around a lot\u2014 which has touched me in ways only another child of wanderlust fathers can understand.A few take-ways in no particular order: I\u2019ll never think of Asian buffets the same way again, I need to go to Missouri, did Rose Wilder really have a house in the same small CT city I lived in and I never knew it and lastly, I gotta try bahn mi (forgive the potentially wrong spelling.) In my quest this year to read stories from other places and cultures, I\u2019ve read some wonderful books.

The first chapter books I read on my own were the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d series. I watched every episode of the television show and still know the plots of many of them, though they have little relation to the books I\u2019ve read to the point of being dog-eared.The point is, when I saw the cover of Bich Minh Nguyen\u2019s PIONEER GIRL, I was hooked.I wanted to be Laura growing up. Why wouldn\u2019t I want to read about a girl who wanted to be Laura even though I\u2019m a grownup?The parallel that Nguyen uses with Lee, the main character, and real life Laura is genius. Lee is a first-generation American, born to Vietnamese immigrants after the Vietnam War. Lee is essentially a pioneer so it comes across as absolutely natural that she would identify with pioneer girl Laura. And that\u2019s what this novel is about \u2013 searching for identity in the midst of preserving the identity of one\u2019s family and one\u2019s culture.Lee\u2019s mother demands a lot of her daughter and her son, and they both react differently and theyPioneer Girl both have trouble seeing the real motive behind her actions. Lee and Sam want to shed their Vietnamese nature and become something they see as fully American and essentially run-of-the-mill. Lee stretches truths, flat out lies, and blatantly hides from her mother even after she earns a PhD in literature. But at the same time, she is a dutiful enough daughter that she comes home to work in the family restaurant and isn\u2019t naive enough to realize that a part of her deception stems from wanting to protect her mother from the harsh realities of American life, in part because her mother suffered so much in Vietnam and worked so hard to create a perfect world for her children.This isn\u2019t much different than Laura Ingalls Wilder. Her parents made decisions for her and made it clear she was meant to do certain things in life. She protected them by pretending she understood it, liked it, and was happy to do it. That wasn\u2019t always true. And when she married a man ten years her senior, she left the family almost as soon as she could. That was rare then, really, so she, like Lee in modern day, was a pioneer girl and ends as a pioneer woman.Nguyen has created an amazing cast of supporting characters for Lee\u2019s; mother, brother, grandfather, best white friends, ex-lovers, new lovers. But Lee is supported too by her connection to the past, whether or not the pin her grandfather got in his Saigon cafe was from Rose Wilder Lane or not, and by Laura, Rose, Almanzo and the rest of the Ingalls family. Nguyen has written Lee into the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library \u2013 home of the Rose Wilder Lane papers, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum, and various libraries in San Francisco. I\u2019ve never been to any of those places, but they were described so well that I felt like I was.Perhaps the best thing I can say about PIONEER GIRL is that I\u2019m going to read the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d series again. And it will be lovely.(I received a copy of PIONEER GIRL through NetGalley and Penguin in exchange for an honest and original review. All thoughts are my own.)"}, {"userName": "Lucy Barnhouse", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13063937-lucy-barnhouse", "userReview": "I think there should be more books like this one: it's deliberately light reading, but it's also surprisingly lyrical, and surprisingly profound. Its protagonist, Lee, is a Vietnamese-American who's a recent Ph.D.: she's a scholar of physical place/space and spiritual belonging, and although she, disillusioned, often dismisses her work on Wharton as irrelevant to her lived experiences, it's poignantly easy for the reader to see the parallels between Wharton's feverishly anxious, grasping, lost protagonists, and the narrator herself. The texts Lee is most fascinated by, though, are the Little House on the Prairie books: canonical favorites of childhood (mine as well as hers) but also a narrative of the failures and exigencies of the so-called American dream. Here is where Lee finds resonances with her own life, and she chases questions of authorship, truth, and belonging through multiple research libraries and across vast, desolate expanses of the land taken by those who believed in manifest destiny. As an academic, I twitched whenever she stole a document (yes, this happened more than once.) But as a reader, I find myself still reflecting on the poignancy of this: as a victim of the \"American dream\" narrative, the only way Lee can imagine asserting her right to analyze this history, to critique it, to wrestle with it... is to take without asking, for asking leads only to denial. In many ways, yes, it's a sad book; but it's also, ultimately, a hopeful one, celebrating the unreasonable perseverance of those laboriously staking out their places in the world."}, {"userName": "Crizzle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8809043-crizzle", "userReview": "It was really interesting that I began reading this when I did - it's a fiction story about a Vietnamese American girl traveling from the Midwest to San Francisco while learning the mysteries of Rose Wilder Lane's life (the one daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder). I began reading it in the Minneapolis airport flying to San Francisco... I am also in the middle of reading \"On the Banks of Plum Creek\" to the girls. I loved all the Wilder history... real or made-up, it was still fun. It was interesting to find out much of the books were written by Laura's daughter, who was a successful writer before Laura's books made it big. The acknowledgements list several nonfiction books about Laura that I need to add to my to-read list. Why is this lady so fascinating? I love the way Lee (the Vietnamese American character) and her story intersected with these pioneering ladies of the past. I love the common ground they share just by sharing the American dream - that you can work hard to better your life. Both families continue to move from city to city in pursuit of better work when something didn't work out as planned, which is basically the story of Pa Ingalls' life (although I think he should have never left the big woods of Wisconsin, leaving their family just because he felt there were too many people settling nearby... but that's for another day).I did NOT appreciate Lee's random 'love' interests.

I really didn't have any attachment to any of the characters, and the casual attitude that Lee has towards all her relationships, whether they were her family, friends, or love interests were so impossibly casual and uncaring, I didn't care much either. I think the author really misses out bu not letting Lee develop a more intense relationship with someone: she really could have done something with her grandfather or brother, or even one of the men she has very casual affairs with.

A small error, but historically incorrect.What I found disappointing is the characters. Nguyen never gives us more than one or two dimensional characters. At times her portrayal of Lee's mother felt stereotypical and cardboard. I wanted to know more about her parent's time in Vietnam. I wanted to know what else shaped her mother, and I really wished to know her kind grandfather better. Lee's brother is torn between obligation and tradition, too.
