While not at the level of his best selling work, \u201dThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team,\u201d this is a valuable addition to the subject and quandary of organizational silos. The story revolves around a young consultant struggling to get his practice off the ground while riding the rough waves of unhappy clients. Eventually, our hero comes up with a model that ties departments together towards a common cause: The Thematic Goal. A Thematic Goal is the \u201csingle, qualitative, time framed, rallying cry adopted by the entire management team.\u201d If for example, your company has just made an acquisition, a thematic goal that every department could collaborate upon would be: Integrating the acquisition into the company. Each functional area would draw up \u201cDefining Objectives\u201d that represent their contribution to achieving the goal. With everyone pulling in the same direction, great ideas are more likely to cross pollinate and groups that normally barely talk to one another actually work together towards the Thematic Goal\u2019s success.

Although the \"consultant figuring it out along the way\" is a relatable story, and I think the overall themes are pretty good, but it didn't have any major AHA type moments in the book like some of the others have. The concepts are on point. Silos and turf wars ruin organizations and start even at small sizes, and so understanding that and working actively to prevent it is a good thing. I think the major thing to take away from the book is that if you sit on a leadership team, you need to leave your title at the door and just come into all meetings with the idea that your job - regardless of your role - is to make the company better. This concept resonates with me but is in conflict with the box concept EOS drives.

One great part of it is that Lencioni recognizes that forward-looking efforts take place alongside ongoing operations, so the model for making progress over 6, 9, 12 or 18 months shouldn't ignore enduring concerns\u2014even if on their own they won't provide a sense of purpose or help an organization make a big leap forward in how or what it does.Things I noted for future use:136: Senior management team members are selected not just for expertise in their areas but also for their ability to contribute across the board. They should disregard titles when they're together (focus on the organization's overall priorities, even if not closely related to their functional area), then put their functional hats back on when they go back to work.151-155: Start senior team meetings with review of:* the Thematic Goal (6- to 9-month goal that represents your biggest current obstacle or threat in the way of a long-term [e.g., 5-year] goal);* 4-5 Defining Objectives\u2014key subject areas that support the thematic goal. Measure in qualitative way (red/yellow/green) rather than metric-driven or numeric; and* 4-5 Standard Operating Objectives that represent the ongoing priorities that you can't lose sight of. These create context for every staff meeting. If anyone brings up things specific to their department that don't make a meaningful impact on the big-ticket items, then it's clearer that it's not a priority. Senior managers responsible for consistently reinforcing with their teams. 176-177: When silos exist, blame lies at the top of the organization. Silos arise when executives fail to \"provide themselves and their employees with a compelling context for working together.\" Without a shared context, everyone pursues their own agendas assuming those agendas are in the organization's best interest. 186: After you've established the framework, add metrics. Don't have to be quantifiable: often they will be dates by which a given activity will be completed. Don't try to artificially assign specific numbers to immeasurable activities.197-201: organize staff meetings around the thematic goal. Start not with set agenda\u2014which has everyone report out on their functional areas even when they may not have pressing issues\u2014but by building a real-time agenda in 10 min. or less:1. Everyone gets 30 seconds to name their top three priorities for the week. 2. Team grading of all the Defining Objectives and Standard Operating Objectives\u2014qualitative (red/yellow/green) based on judgement of leaders. Discussion will keep things accountable. Overall leader breaks ties (\"let's call it orange\").3. Determine where to spend time, based on most pressing needs. Challenge teammates whose key priorities aren't related to thematic goal or are in area already doing well. Figure out how more areas can help with Objectives that need additional help\u2014even if it means slowing progress in areas that are going well."}, {"userName": "Cathy Allen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8027325-cathy-allen", "userReview": "The thing to know about Patrick Lencioni's fables is that they are written from a consultant's perspective. Since I am a consultant, I deeply appreciate that. It helps to have established methods and models to effectively help client organizations work through their challenges. Both Five Dysfunctions of a Team and Death by Meeting contain excellent tools I have used to help others identify their specific needs and take steps to improve. It's fun work. In my practice I have sometimes found it difficult to convince clients that their team is dysfunctional or that their meetings don't have to suck. In those cases, I can rely on one or more of the tools in Lencioni's books to help then diagnose their issues themselves, which of course increases buy-in for whatever solutions are chosen. With Silos, Politics and Turf Wars, however, no such tools exist. When units within an organization are siloed (not communicating effectively) or when people are spending energy guarding their turf rather than contributing to team success, it seems particularly easy to blame others. \"It's the fault of the people in that other department. They are causing the problems.\" That's when my client really needs me to share my observations directly and suggest strategies for changing their own habits and practices. And that's where Lencioni lets me down this time. In the fable, an aspiring consultant identifies turf issues at play in each of the first three clients he takes on. As the story progresses, we see how he addresses the problems and reveals his method for helping them work through it. We even get to see him fall on his face, causing real damage by ham-handedly pointing out how internal politics is holding one organization back. Though it almost gets him fired, he pulls it out in the end. This was an excellent caution for me as a consultant... but Lencioni then provides little guidance on how to avoid the same mistake myself.As with all of Lencioni's works, the \"model\" is described in the last 30 pages. For Silos, Politics and Turf Wars, the prescription includes 1) identifying an over-arching, organization-wide \"thematic goal\", 2) establishing \"defining objectives,\" 3) developing a set of \"ongoing standard operating objectives\", and 4) choosing the \"metrics\" with which to measure progress. All good stuff and hugely beneficial for any group of two or more people. I just wish I knew how to convince more of my clients that this is the way to go. I think the need for goals, objectives, and metrics is so obvious to Lencioni (as it is to me) that he struggles to articulate the \"why\" part, though that is exactly the part that people outside of our professional field need most.Still, I am glad I read this one and I will also recommend it to anyone I think will benefit. Maybe someday I will be the one who figures out how to explain the why part, and write that book myself."}, {"userName": "Rick Yvanovich", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/617112-rick-yvanovich", "userReview": "Yet another great fable followed by case studies and deeper explanations.

Jude Cousins is a talented, energetic, and ambitious young marketing executive at Hatch Technology who, with his wife Teresa's support and encouragement, decides to leave his secure job after Hatch is purchased by Bell Financial Systems. He establishes an independent consulting practice and almost immediately obtains three clients: The Madison Hotel (San Francisco's oldest, largest, and most prestigious independent hotel), JMJ Fitness Machines (a manufacturer of high-end consumer and institutional exercise equipment), and Children's Hospital of Sacramento. Jude also agrees to help Father Ralph Colombano, pastor of Corpus Christi Church (in Walnut Hill, California) on a pro bono basis. One of the many challenges when writing a business narrative is to create fictional characters and relationships which are plausible. Although Lencioni calls his book a \"leadership fable\" (and it is), he anchors Jude in familiar, real-world situations when explaining how to destroy \"the barriers that turn colleagues into competitors.\" He never allows his characters to sound like they are lecturing or preaching. Wisely, Lencioni includes only as much dialogue as is absolutely necessary. Silos, Politics and Turf Wars succeeds as a \"realistic but fictional story\" precisely because Lencioni achieves and then sustains an appropriate balance between what is fact (e.g. constant infighting among those in its workforce can tear an organization apart) and what is believable. After its \"honeymoon,\" Cousins Consulting proceeds through a period which resembles a ride on a \"roller coaster\" until Jude experiences several \"moments of truth.\" Lencioni has some quite serious objectives in mind. As he explains, \"To tear down silos, leaders must go beyond behaviors and address the contextual issues at the heart of departmental separation and politics. The purpose of this book is to present a simple, powerful tool for addressing those issues and reducing the pain that silos cause. And that pain should not be underestimated.\" Indeed not."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42203-lisa", "userReview": "I'm generally not a fan of corporate leadership books, but when my boss handed me this and recommended that I read it, I complied. Patrick Lencioni also wrote \"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team\", that a former mentor had me read. His approach is through narrative fables, which makes it a lot less technical and - let's face it - boring. This fable is about Jude Cousins, a fellow who quits his job after issues following his company's merger, and decides to start business as an independent consultant. It goes through his personal growth and development, and realizing that the downside of being a consultant is that after a problem is fixed, the consultant is no longer needed. So he began to look into those issues that management can never seem to get around, and the big one was \"silos\". This is corporate-speak for factions - departments working interdependently, but with the attitude that they're completely independent and, more often than not, more crucial than others. So, production has the attitude of \"we make the product, you can't work without us\" while marketing thinks \"we sell the product - so what's the use of having it if you can't sell it?\", etc., etc. These silos don't communicate well with each other because they place their own goals ahead of the group.In my corporate experience, this really is a huge issue, and Lencioni's approach to handling it (finding a rallying cry or thematic goal for the whole group, sharing common over-arcing goals) is appropriate. However, these solutions are often what I see in team building activities. The emphasis that Lencioni made that I appreciated is that these thematic goals need to be emphasized regularly, and with the management team - not just in the trenches. His approach to challenging turf wars was to remind the people in charge that their attitudes were shaping everyone who reported to them. As someone in the middle of a turf war, this was incredibly relevant and useful. In combination with some basic personality-type and conflict-resolution training, this has very much helped my outlook on my particular battle - and more importantly, was a good reminder that my actions and words reverberate and have an impact on anyone who can hear me."}, {"userName": "Paul Herriott", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66380207-paul-herriott", "userReview": "Typical Lencioni, a beautifully crafted story that reveals principles of leadership while displaying human flaws.

When this topic comes up I've been known to say, with a straight face because there's nothing funny about it, \"So and so is busy peeing all over the place.\" The inference, of course, that they are marking their territory, claiming their turf, and building a silo that reaches to the skies. I hate politics. I mean I really hate them. I have seen firsthand how they contribute to a toxic culture/environment. So clearly reading this title was a \"must\" for me. \"Silos, and the turf wars they enable - devastate organizations. They waste resources, kill productivity, and jeopardize the achievement of goals. But beyond all that, they exact a considerable human toll too. They cause frustration, stress, and disillusionment by forcing employees to fight bloody, unwinnable battles with people who should be their teammates. There is perhaps no greater cause of professional anxiety and exasperation - not to mention turnover - than employees having to fight with people in their organization. Understandably and inevitably, this bleeds over into their personal lives, affecting family and friends in profound ways.\" (Introduction, pages viii/ix)In this leadership fable Lencioni features several types of organizations/businesses in his fictional story about a very real problem. I love that he did this in this title because he is able to show how the problem exists in all sizes of organizations and that the solution he proposes can also be used no matter what size the org. It's a one-size-fits-all and in a very good way. But Lencioni's solution will only work when everyone cooperates and decides to quit with all the in-fighting and marking of territory and let's face it, some people aren't willing to do that. That's when other measures have to be taken and he covers that also in his other book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team.

The main point of this book was great. Companies/organizations are at their best in a crisis mode, but when a company/organization is successful for a long time (or sometimes not so long) they tend to have inter-departmental silos, politics and turf wars.So why wait for a crisis to bring out the best in your organization?Why not generate a rally cry or \"thematic goal\" that everyone in the organization can rally around for the greater good of the organization. This doesn't forsake the day to day, but in addition to operational goals with the understanding that if an unhealthy silo-ing company/organization continues to meet operational goals they will be in the same position next month or next year or in 5 years.Lencioni suggests that a thematic goal is made driven by an action:\u2022 Complete the merge of two organizations\u2022 Reposition the company for more health-conscious consumers\u2022 Restore the school's reputation\u2022 etcAnd then they are supported by defining objectives that are the building blocks of a thematic goal.He clarified that a thematic goal is a time specific goal with a clear stopping point and is not to be confused with a vision or mission or BHAG.Most encouraging line in the book for me, as that I currently work at a church was in the last chapter where he said \"he would learn that silos in churches can be particularly difficult to dismantle, but that clarity of mission there can be a powerful motivator for doing so.\"Overall a fast read, thought provoking and a clear summary made this a useful book."}, {"userName": "S'hi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/784353-s-hi", "userReview": "A very easy read about quite difficult territory in many organizations.
