You made me cry and laugh and cry. Wasn't too much of a mystery as it was focused more on the tragedy and Jennifer.The romance was slow and sweet. The struggles Rachael faced were real and they were hard. I like the realism of the school shooting and in Jennifer's death. The point where I started bawling like a baby was here:The sun appeared over the hillside. \"I'm tired, Tom.\"It's okay to go home,\" he choked.\"Hold my hand?\"His arms tightened around her and his fingers interlaced with hers. She closed her eyes against the brightness, \"I love you.\"\"I love you too,\" he whispered.Jennifer died feeling the warmth of the rising sun.I know it is a great book when it makes me cry!"}, {"userName": "Jesseca Wheaton", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39986158-jesseca-wheaton", "userReview": "[ Was the shooting from the beginning of the book ever solved?

I loved this series as a teenager. The self-made family. And Rachel was a favorite. Rachel. Marcus. Lisa.Stephen, Jack, and Kate were great too. And Sara. But Rachel has my heart. Now I want to go back and read her again. Anyway, Rachel's story is a hard one. The losing never stops. It's hard to trust God in the face of so much pain.

It focuses more on how Christians handle a death that comes too soon, and the dilemma of why God would allow such a thing to happen. The romance between Cole and Rachel was quiet and slow-building, and a good bit of the groundwork had been laid in the previous book.

Her specialty? Helping children through trauma. When a school shooting rips through her community, she finds herself dealing with more than just grief among the children she is trying to help. One of them saw the shooting, and the gun is still missing.Dee Henderson is a great writer. She knows how to write for the people who love suspense but are somewhat romantics. This series is a story about 7 people who were orphans and when they were kids they all were placed in an orphanage called the Trevor House. When they were leagally able they became a family by choice and changed all of their names to O\u2019Malley. There\u2019s a U.S. Marshall in the mix, a firefighter, and a trauma counselor among other professions. And this series goes through a mystery in their respective professions as well as leading them to the love of their life.The Healer was a little different from the other O\u2019Malley series. It dealt partly with the possiblility of one of the O\u2019Malley sisters dying of cancer. Rachel is really torn up about this and it makes you want to cry. This book definitely showed more of Henderson\u2019s tender side in writing.The mystery itself was also a tear-jerker because the shooting affected so many of the other characters in this book. When something like this happens in real life it is like time slows down and stops moving forward and I think Henderson did a good job of producing that effect in this story. When I think back to the book even now, I feel that it took the characters a while to recover from this and move on. But they did eventually move on.The love part of this story was instrumental in keeping Rachel on her feet through both the shooting and her sister\u2019s sickness. It was great to see writing that tied together all of these elements and actually show us how the character got through it. It wasn\u2019t some one liner like, \u2018she pulled herself together and got through the day.\u2019 It showed Rachel\u2019s thought process of leaning on God, her family and her work to make it through.If you are looking for a tear-jerker read this book. But also if you want something that shows a realistic senario of coming to grips with pain and death, pick this up. There was no carriage sweeping Rachel away from her pain. She had to face it. And while books are probably sometimes picked up for their fairy tale factor this book is a great alternative.Originally reviewed at : www.the-vault.co.cc"}, {"userName": "VaultOfBooks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3929792-vaultofbooks", "userReview": "By:Dee Henderson.

Dee Henderson has a way of completely wrapping you up in her characters in a way few other authors can truly achieve. Their emotions become yours. This is a major plot development in the O'Malley series. Cole and Rachel's relationship development seemed a little flat to me compared to the other novels but Rachel herself was very well developed & the reader is really drawn into her character. I think the lack of the relationship building was in part due to the way they were introduced and that Jennifer doesn't have a novel of her own and in the particular book she played a greater role than usual. Still a great read. I definitely recommend Henderson's books to those interested in Christian fiction & I definitely recommend reading the O'Malley series in order.

Rachel feels deeply and Dee Henderson does a phenomenal job conveying that feeling. Rachel is trying to help kids deal with the loss of their homes during a flood. Days later, she is in the middle of a double-school shooting. Now she's not only helping kids who've lost their homes and possessions, she's trying to help kids deal with the fear and grief of a school shooting, while trying to process her own emotions of being there herself. Added on top of all the, the pain, fear, and grief of Jennifer's cancer. I can count on one hand the number of books that make me cry. This book had me tearing up. I managed to hold it together pretty well, until the letter Jennifer wrote to Tom. Then I had to get a tissue to stop the tears from falling (I really don't like to cry). Until the very end, I was hoping that just maybe, Jennifer would be healed. It wasn't looking likely, but I hoped. I don't think I could have that kind of attitude. And Tom. I don't think I could do what he did. Lisa and Kate married Quinn and Dave. Are we going to have three more weddings in Stephen's book? An interesting thing about Rachel's story is that she doesn't become a believer in the book. Between Jack's story and her's she comes to faith, but she still struggles as a new believer (and let's face it, every believer struggles)."}, {"userName": "Kaisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34789948-kaisa", "userReview": "4 solid stars.

I love the comfort these books seem to emanate, and the way the O'Malleys rally around each other, even in the darkest of moments. I still find myself thinking about the way it just can't be possible for everyone to be able to work around each other's schedules when they need to. That all the O'Malleys and their spouses are in jobs that are demanding, and often notoriously stressful, so it's amazing how they always find a way to take control of their situations and schedules to make time for the family. Don't get me wrong, I admire and adore that, I absolutely do. But I just can't believe it can always work out the way the O'Malleys want it to.
