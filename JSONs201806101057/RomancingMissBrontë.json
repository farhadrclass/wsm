The reader gets a unique glimpse into the minds of the Bront\u00ebs, what their lives were probably like and how unfortunate their brother's existence turned out to be.I loved hearing Juliet Gael's vision of their character and personality quirks.The second half of the book, focused primarily on Charlotte and her relationship with Arthur, was a drag.Up until that point, the women were surprisingly self sufficient, considering the times in which they lived. Yes, they coddled their alcoholic and opium-addicted brother. Yes, they indulged the whims of their ailing father, but for the most part, they acted how they pleased.Once Arthur enters her life, Charlotte centers every action around him. He tells her who she can write. He controls their social schedule.The book enters a repetitive loop: Charlotte does something Arthur doesn't like, he reprimands her, she writes her friend a letter about how annoying it is but she simply adores her husband so it's ok... and repeat.This was probably the reality of her situation but it sucked. I can't imagine that I would have been happy living like that. I don't believe she was either.The cringe-inducing letters Gael describes in the story actually exist. I also think that if I was a sensitive and reclusive person like Charlotte Bront\u00eb, having my personal letters published after my death would be a nightmare situation.Charlotte and her sisters were forced to live a sub-par existence because they were women.Traditional roles for women left so little room for living. It's astonishing that the Bront\u00ebs were able to write anything at all, when you consider when they lived and the disadvantages to their station.They were poor, lived in the middle of nowhere and had no one they could rely on except themselves.Add to the mix a dose of religious guilt and social expectations... again, the world is fortunate to have their stories.I suggest reading Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights instead of this."}, {"userName": "La Mala \u270c", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234598-la-mala", "userReview": "3.5\"Behind a veneer of a quiet, ladylike demeanor, Charlotte concealed an acerbic mind and ruthlessly harsh opinions on the weaknesses of the human species. Arthur, on the other hand, was the blustery, bigoted sort who could barely open his mouth without offending someone. Yet when the gloves came off, he had a great and tender heart, and was capable of love that would bear all wrongs, endure all tempests\u2014in short, the very stuff that Charlotte took great pains to fabricate in her stories and that she was convinced she would never find.\"La novela es fiel a los hechos tal como pasaron, de eso uno no se puede quejar. La famosa declaraci\u00f3n de amor de Nicholls a Charlotte (m\u00e1s a lo MR.DARCY que a lo Rochetser, hablando de \"sufrimientos imposibles de seguir soportando\" XD) est\u00e1 tal cual lo cuenta ella en una de sus cartas a Ellen Nussey. Esa escena me pareci\u00f3 muy bien lograda; lo mismo digo del retrato novelezco que se hace de las grandes pasiones que sufri\u00f3 Charlotte en su vida: su amor no correspondido hacia M. Heger, y su otro amor no correspondido hacia George Smith. (La vida de Charlotte estuvo marcada por enamoramientos de ese calibre hasta que la declaraci\u00f3n totalmente inesperada de Arthur Bell Nicholls y la testaruda oposici\u00f3n de su padre, Patrick- junto con el casamiento repentino de G.

Ahora bien, entiendo que se sabe poco y nada acerca de c\u00f3mo pensaba o se sent\u00eda Arthur realmente (era un hombre muy privado, no le gustaba en absoluto que se le metieran en la intimidad) as\u00ed que, por ese lado, es entendible que se falle en escribir un ABN cre\u00edble. \u00a1O capaz soy yo! La idea de imaginarme momentos sexies entre esa pareja tan hermosa, que existi\u00f3, me pone inc\u00f3moda...muy inc\u00f3moda.

It left me in tears. Years ago, when I was thirteen or fourteen, my mother insisted over and over that I read Jane Eyre. I kept trying, but I just couldn't get past the first 100 pages. I couldn't see how it would improve. It felt depressing and morose. Finally, when I was fifteen, I committed to it. I don't think any novel has had a greater impact on me since. I fell in love with Jane and with Mr. Rochester. I cried when the could no longer be together. It was the first classical \"adult\" novel I had read. My mother was right. And I've never quite gotten over it. It was, after all, my first love.This book in some ways was much the same. Charlotte's life seemed so provincial, ordinary and much of the time, morose and sad. So I wasn't sure I wanted to know. I wondered if anything happy and good, beyond the publication and vast success of her novels, would happen to her. But it did. For a brief moment, Charlotte experienced all the happiness and all the goodness her life deserved. She was a noble, good woman. She was extremely intelligent. She formed deep and lasting friendships with a broad array of people.Although the book is fiction, at first I thought it read a little too much like a biography. Now I appreciate the way the author wrote the story to so closely mirror Charlotte's real life. Because of that, I got a glimpse of an extraordinary woman. I was extremely happy to find her married to a man worthy of her. While at first she didn't see it, she came discover what a truly great man he was. He was of constant service to others and to her. All the while she had been looking for some exotic Mr. Rochester when what she really wanted had been in front of her for eight years. I think what I loved best was watching Charlotte finally fall in love with Arthur Nicholls, the constant curate who had served her father's parish so well. My hat goes off to Juliet Gael. What a beautiful story of a very beautiful woman's life."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17920620-holly", "userReview": "What a sad life Charlotte Bronte lived.

I can't imagine what Anne & Emily would have come up with if they had lived long enough. Charlotte has received the most accolades but they all deserve recognition for their literary genius. I enjoyed this novel for the most part. I liked all the information about the Brontes, most I already knew but it's still so sad to read about. So much death and sadness. Now I know why they escaped into their imaginary worlds. How lucky for their readers. What I didn't like was that I thought it was a little too long. The title kinda suggest a romance but you really didn't get to the heart of that until more than halfway through.

Perhaps I was expecting more fiction than fact, more fluff than substance. What a pleasant surprise to discover that Romancing Miss Bronte was nothing like that at all. Ms. Gael's prose is somewhat Austenesque although her subject matter is nowhere near Ms. Austen's well to do, charming, close-knit family with suitors stumbling over each other. This is the story of the family Bronte headed by a patriarch who is curate of the little Yorkshire town of Haworth and perhaps living through his own grief he pays little attention to his lonely, tragic brood who resort to creating their own imaginary worlds through stories and poetry. Though their brother, Branwell struggles with his own demons, the girls, Emily, Anne and Charlotte devise a plan to publish their works under pseudonyms. The rest is literary history which Ms. Gael relates with a well researched eye. Many a reader is sure to see the love that Ms. Gael holds for her subjects as it comes through in a tender and almost sorrowful and sympathetic manner while still being truthful.I struggle giving this novel 4.5 stars when I know I should give 5, yet that would place it in the realm of Wolf Hall and perhaps it is not quite there, but so very, very close \u2013 as close as Charlotte was to a life of happiness and contentment.

That\u2019s because I always considered it such a tragedy that almost all the people she was close to died so early, and she herself marrying someone that (as I got the impression from reading the bios) she didn\u2019t truly and passionately love. And dying during her pregnancy at that. What a sad way to go. I wished that there was an author out there who would be able to capture Charlotte\u2019s life all the way to that conclusion honestly and sympathetically, at the least, with maybe some extra insight into the life of an author I only knew a little bit about. I really wanted a happy ending to what I believed was a sad fate for Charlotte, author of such a tremendous work like \u201cJane Eyre\u201d. With this novel, I got all of that, but also a level of such love and respect for the Bronte siblings, their lives and work, that I was quite literally blown away.Most significantly, this book was written from the heart. I was astounded that the Bronte sisters, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne were written so well. Each had their own distinct personality that was developed fully and realistically. Even their brother Bramwell was a fully rendered character. Their close relationship as a family was very convincing. They come alive in this novel truly as sisters, bound together by love and respect, but not without their own wants and needs that lead to misunderstandings and disagreements. I was very eager to read about what their family life was possibly like, considering the author of \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d was one of the sisters. I became engrossed by Gael\u2019s skillful portrait of these sisters\u2019 interactions with each other and with their father and brother. Gael so respects her characters that she doesn\u2019t shy away from detailing their hurts, fears, humiliations, and even their deepest darkest thoughts. I believe you can find a well-rounded, authentic portrait of each of the characters in this novel, and we are all the better for it. For in these characters we can see ourselves.Secondly, \u201cRomancing Miss Bronte\u201d is well-written, meticulously researched work. As far as I can tell, the events in the book follow the events of Charlotte\u2019s own life. The author just imagines these events in intimate detail, drawing us in the story by making every part of her life fascinating and personal. You experience her joys, suffer her humiliations, grieve with her, and feel the deepest, deepest sympathy for her. She really was an extraordinary woman, I just had no idea until I read this novel. And yet, just a real woman, with the same insecurities and emotions. Lastly, this novel is real. Despite the title, I don\u2019t believe this book is about \u201cromance.\u201d It\u2019s about Charlotte discovering her true self (clich\u00e9 as that sounds). It\u2019s an honest depiction of a human being, a woman that was under so much pressure, not only from those around her, but also from herself. A good life is not always what you think it should be, and truth can come from unexpected places, as the quote from Charlotte\u2019s last book \u201cVillette\u201d on the cover page eloquently puts it. The complete meaning of the quote can only be fully realized at the end of the novel. And so, it is with complete respect and honesty that I give this marvelous novel 5 stars. Thank you, Ms. Gael. Truly, truly I consider it a great privilege to have been able to read it."}, {"userName": "Georgiana 1792", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4581563-georgiana-1792", "userReview": "Biografia romanzata di una famiglia straordinariaQuesta biografia romanzata parte dall\u2019arrivo del reverendo Arthur Bell Nicholls \u2014 il curato del reverendo Bront\u00eb \u2014 alla canonica di Haworth. Le tre sorelle Bront\u00eb, Charlotte, Emily e Anne, nutrono il sogno di rendersi indipendenti. Un sogno piuttosto arduo da realizzarsi per tre donne nell\u2019Inghilterra Vittoriana. Le fanciulle, dopo una breve e difficile parentesi come istitutrici, sperano di poter aprire una propria scuola. Intanto vivono nella piccola cittadina dello Yorkshire dedicandosi a lunghe ed estenuanti passeggiate nella brughiera, accompagnate dagli adorati cani Flossy e Keeper, tollerando a malapena gli sbalzi di umore dell\u2019amatissimo fratello Branwell \u2014 che soffre i postumi di una relazione adulterina stordendosi con alcol e oppio \u2014 e scrivendo.Fin da giovanissimi i quattro fratelli Bront\u00eb, infatti, si sono dedicati alla scrittura, ambientando le loro opere nei mondi fantastici di Angria (Charlotte e Branwell) e di Gondal (Emily e Anne). Cos\u00ec Charlotte, Emily e Anne pensano di raccogliere in un unico volume le loro poesie pi\u00f9 belle e di darle alle stampe. Per farsi prendere seriamente in considerazione dalle case editrici e per mantenere l\u2019anonimato, le tre sorelle decidono di diventare tre fratelli, Currer, Ellis e Acton Bell, conducendo una doppia vita di scrittori da una parte e di giovani e morigerate figlie di un ministro del culto dall\u2019altra. In particolare, Emily vorrebbe scrivere solo per se stessa: \u00e8 gelosa della sua vita interiore e preferirebbe non far conoscere le sue storie e i suoi versi al mondo. Teme che il mondo non capirebbe \u2014 e cos\u00ec \u00e8, effettivamente, in principio \u2014 e che considererebbe i sentimenti che esprime violenti ed eccessivi.\u00abAbbiamo fatto tutta la strada fino a Wycoller\u00bb, aggiunse Emily, che era un\u2019indomita camminatrice dotata di un\u2019incredibile resistenza che non paventava di affrontare colline, spoglie brughiere, distese di erica e di ginestrone, n\u00e9 di guadare torrenti o di raggiungere le cime pi\u00f9 alte, per tornare a casa soltanto quando l\u2019ultima traccia di luce aveva lasciato il cielo. Raramente diceva loro dove era andata o cosa aveva visto, ma a volte mostrava il disegno che aveva fatto strada facendo. Un giorno era rientrata con un falco ferito, che aveva curato e chiamato Nero.La Gael ci racconta degli straordinari personaggi della canonica di Haworth: le tre sorelle che affermano al mondo il loro talento e Branwell, la cui vita e il cui talento vengono sprecati a causa di un amore infelice e di un temperamento poco perseverante.\u00c8 invero una di quelle piccole tragedie umane, alcuni arriverebbero a parlare di scherzo divino: riempire un cuore di desideri, modellarlo cos\u00ec perfettamente a una vocazione e poi negare a chi lo possiede il coraggio necessario a soddisfarla.Ancora ci fa vedere il diverso atteggiamento dei fratelli nell\u2019affrontare la vita e la malattia. In particolare Emily e Anne, che si ammaleranno a breve distanza l\u2019una dall\u2019altra. Emily \u00e8 pi\u00f9 fatalista: quando si ammala si rassegna e si lascia vincere dalla malattia come una barca alla deriva. Anne \u00e8 invece pi\u00f9 tenace, \u00e8 coraggiosa e combatte la malattia \u201ccome se trovasse esilarante l\u2019idea di trovarsi faccia a faccia con la morte\u201d. Il titolo di quest\u2019opera di Juliet Gael mi sembra piuttosto riduttivo: sebbene il primo capitolo e il titolo ci facciano sospettare che si tratti di un romanzo incentrato sulla storia d\u2019amore fra Nicholls e Charlotte con l\u2019aggiunta di elementi biografici, in realt\u00e0 ci troviamo di fronte a una vera e propria biografia di tutta la famiglia Bront\u00eb. In alcuni tratti questo libro ha proprio il sapore di una biografia tradizionale: c\u2019\u00e8 ben poco di romanzato. La Gael, riportando recensioni di libri, articoli di giornale e frammenti di lettere autentiche, veste infatti il suo lavoro di un\u2019aria accademica. Tuttavia, subito dopo si ritorna alla fiction grazie a dialoghi e pensieri. La Miss Bront\u00eb del titolo (Charlotte), poi, risulta essere la protagonista della storia semplicemente perch\u00e9 \u00e8 stata la pi\u00f9 longeva delle sorelle Bront\u00eb e anche quella di cui sono rimaste pi\u00f9 testimonianze. Ecco perch\u00e9 nella seconda parte del libro, sono Charlotte e Arthur gli indiscussi protagonisti, con la loro storia d\u2019amore, di devozione e di perseveranza, che \u00e8 davvero degna di un romanzo. Tuttavia il titolo continua a risultare riduttivo, sebbene ritenga una scelta adeguata la sua \u2018non-traduzione\u2019 in italiano.Nel suo tentativo di non romanzare troppo la storia, aggiungendo dettagli che potevano per\u00f2 evincersi dalle storie delle eroine dei suoi romanzi \u2014 e di restringere la narrazione agli anni che vanno dal 1844 circa, fino alla morte di Charlotte nel 1855 \u2014 la Gael dice troppo poco riguardo alle esperienze delle sorelle Bront\u00eb nelle scuole da loro frequentate: nella Clergy Daughter's School, di Cowan Bridge, nella scuola di Roe Head e, infine, nel Pensionnat Heger di Bruxelles. Su quest\u2019ultima esperienza in particolare, che vide Charlotte innamorarsi del suo professore, Monsieur Heger, l\u2019autrice ha preferito mantenersi molto vaga, limitandosi ad accennare alle lettere che i due si scambiarono. Del resto anche Elizabeth Gaskell \u2014 a cui il padre e il marito commissionarono una biografia di Charlotte \u2014, dopo essersi recata a Bruxelles per indagare sulla relazione intercorsa fra insegnante e allieva, fu piuttosto reticente, non si capisce se per mancanza di testimonianze raccolte o per proteggere il buon nome dell\u2019amica.Interessante, invece, il rapporto della Bront\u00eb con la Gaskell, che \u00e8 chiamata familiarmente \u2018Lily\u2019: un rapporto fatto di stima e di solidariet\u00e0 femminile, sebbene talvolta la Gael \u2014 probabilmente attingendo alle atmosfere del romanzo di Elizabeth Gaskell Cranford \u2014 abbia dipinto la Gaskell e la sua cerchia come un gruppo di signore dedite alla chiacchiera facile. Come in una biografia che si rispetti, il narratore \u00e8 esterno, sebbene spesso la Gael ci faccia scorgere il punto di vista di alcuni personaggi. Lo stile \u00e8 molto elegante e le descrizioni della brughiera dello Yorkshire fanno onore ai protagonisti del romanzo. Tuttavia, specialmente nella prima parte, la distinzione fra biografia reale e parte romanzata si sente nettamente: sembra di assistere ad uno di quei documentari in cui alla narrazione di fatti storici si alternano filmati realizzati per supportare il racconto, con una sceneggiatura posticcia. Nella seconda parte, quella che ha il diritto di assumere il titolo di Romancing Miss Bront\u00eb, invece, la narrazione scorre fluida, forse proprio perch\u00e9 \u00e8 pi\u00f9 romanzata e meno documentata. Un romanzo imperdibile per gli ammiratori della famiglia Bront\u00eb, ma affascinante anche per chi \u00e8 semplicemente curioso di scoprire cosa accadeva in quella fucina di talenti che era la canonica di Haworth negli anni 40 e 50 del XIX secolo.Potete leggere la recensione completa QUI:http://greenyellowale.blogspot.it/201..."}, {"userName": "Lorraine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21670009-lorraine", "userReview": "Haunting, intriguing, enthralling!

Le loro vite ritirate e a contatto con la natura, le difficolt\u00e0 di dimostrare il proprio talento perch\u00e9 donne, le privazioni e la salute cagionevole che porta alla prematura scomparsa delle due sorelle pi\u00f9 giovani, il successo che giunge, forse troppo tardi, le passioni, i sogni e le sconfitte di Charlotte ma anche di tutte e tre le sorelle, di cui lei fu sempre portavoce. Il romanzo \u00e8 molto centrato su Charlotte, la maggiore delle sorelle scrittrici, la pi\u00f9 famosa e longeva (Emily e Anne moriranno rispettivamente nel 1848 e 1849 di tubercolosi, la stessa malattia che aveva stroncato al vita del loro unico fratello e che le aveva rese malaticce per tutta la vita, mentre Charlotte morir\u00e0 nel 1854) autrice di quel Jane Eyre che tanto le port\u00f2 fortuna e per il quale \u00e8 ancora ricordata tra le pi\u00f9 grandi scrittrici della letteratura mondiale.

But for \"Miss Bront\u00eb\", I shall read! Anything for the Bront\u00ebs. Other writers during the Bront\u00ebs time were mainly concerned about money and marriage, but the Bront\u00ebs were more more more. That is what I love about them. A lot of women of the day would have seen Arthur as a marriage opportunity the second they met him. But even after Arthur proposed, Charlotte remained unconvinced. At almost age forty Charlotte thought of herself as a stunted, spinsterish, poor parson's daughter. Knowing how rare it would be to ever receive another proposal, still she did not immediately accept. She wanted to marry for love and did not love Arthur... yet.  I was worried 'Romancing Miss Bront\u00eb' would take everything that happened within Charlotte's life, and make it simply about her marriage. It did not. The devastating deaths of the siblings occur about halfway through the book. I think this is the perfect amount of time for the relationship between Charlotte and Arthur to develop, while also letting the reader get to know Emily, Anne and Branwell, though I must admit I liked reading about the interactions between the siblings more, especially their walks along the moors. That simply may be due to the sort of reader I am. The closest (and only) thing I've read in the \"romance\" genre are the Bront\u00eb novels. For all the freedom women have in 2010, there is another sort of freedom women had in the 1840s. Women in those days could walk around any moorland they wanted to. These days, if there is anything resembling moorland in America, you would be hard pressed not to find 'private property' signs everywhere you looked (and risk getting shot if you ignore said signs). That, for me, is the ultimate \"romance\" in the time of the Bront\u00ebs. Freedom has been gained but so much has been lost. The Bront\u00ebs mainly wrote about their own past experiences, but it was surprising to see how their books also eerily predicted their futures. Charlotte wrote of the Mr. Rochester fires in Jane Eyre long before her brother Branwell was saved from a fire by Anne and Emily. Arthur's personality reminded me of Jane Eyre's cousin, John Rivers, who discovers Jane near death on the moor, long before Arthur himself mentions the same comparison to Charlotte in 'Romancing Miss Bront\u00eb'. Sure, it is a charming and excellent bit of this book, but did Arthur really say this in real life? I'm always skeptical of historical fiction. I don't like things to be made up just to make a better plot about real people that once had their own integrity to protect, rather than a fictional character. After all, Charlotte can not defend herself now. I was wary that a novel about the Bront\u00ebs could sensationalize their lives (which is funny, seeing as how if anyone can find a fault with the Bront\u00ebs, it is their penchant for gothic drama...but I happen to love that sort of thing.) Even just writing something that Charlotte would have never really said would bother me. I'm not very knowledgeable about the Bront\u00ebs, but I don't believe 'Romancing Miss Bront\u00eb' takes any liberties: I believe Gael's writing sticks close to the truth. This book is perfect if you'd like to know more about the Bront\u00ebs (especially if you'd rather read about them in novel form, rather than a biography). It is also a great read if you already know a ton about the them. If you are a fan of anything Bront\u00eb, read this. If you want to get a better understanding of why the Bront\u00ebs were so loved, in their time and ours, read this. The Bront\u00ebs are amazing. You could probably write anything about them and I would be pleased that they are being remembered.  Sometimes I think of the possibilities of a life. What if Anne, Emily and Charlotte had died the same age as their sisters, Maria and Elizabeth? It makes me sad to wonder what would have happened to literature if the world did not have their books. What amazing novels are we missing that Maria and Elizabeth could have written? And what if Anne, Emily and Charlotte had lived longer? What else may they have written? Imagine if they knew their books were still being read 150 years later! It seems as though the Bront\u00ebs are fiction themselves, so it would make sense to write a first novel about them. Juliet Gael does a lovely job of it. I'm looking forward to seeing what Gael delivers next. Gael's prose alone tells me I'd be interested in her next book, even if it isn't about a topic as captivating as the Bront\u00ebs."}, {"userName": "Maria Grazia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3015503-maria-grazia", "userReview": "If you love Jane Eyre and Charlotte Bront\u00eb, this novel is unmissable. If you are interested in the lives of the Bront\u00eb family, so full of sorrow and talent, you'll love it.Impossible not to be fascinated by the story of the three sisters who managed to get to fame thanks to their strength, talent and ... stubborness. Yes, stubborness. Because, if we have Jane Eyre, Villette and Shirley, Wuthering Heights, Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, we owe that especially to Charlotte's stubborness. She fought to make it and made it at last. This is the prevailing trait of her personality revealed in Juliet Gael's portrait: a certain tenacity, we might even recognize as stubborness.The romance suggested in the title is a constant element in the story. Charlotte spent most of her life trying to forget Monsier Heger, the married professor she fell in love with, unrequited, when she was studying in Brussels. She tried to recognize his stern stare and his strong personality in any man she met, and when she couldn't find them anywhere around her, she depicted those traits on paper, attributing them to her own iconic hero, Mr Rochester.She could never replace Monsier Heger with anyone like him, but she was flattered by the playful, thoughtful, friendly attentions she received by her young and handsome publisher, Mr George Smith, and finally realised loyal, devoted love had always waited for her in the most unexpected place, in the heart of her father's vicar, Reverend Arthur Bell Nichols. Juliet Gael make their love story a very touching romantic tale.Sisterly love is, of course, one of the main themes in this novel, especially in the first part. Charlotte had a very special bond with Emily, whom she considered the most gifted of them all. She deeply admired her and tried to support and protect her, as well. In Ms Gael's picture, she wasn't so patient with Branwell nor easily bore his weakness; she couldn't re-create with Anne the same bond she had with Emily. Anyway, their childhood is conveyed as an extraordinary adventure and a relatively happy period in this novel and it really must have been when they escaped and found refuge in the world of fantasy they had created. Nothing could harm them there. The conflict with the patriarcal figure of Patrick Bront\u00eb is the focus, anyway. Due to her experience as a scriptwriter, Juliet Gael has learnt that a very successful strategy to design a biopic is focusing on one conflict, so she decided to build Charlotte Bront\u00eb 's novel around the conflictual relationship between the patriarcal figure of the father, Patrick Bront\u00eb, distant and authoritative, and his talented daughter, who feared and revered him.If you expect Charlotte as obscure, plain and little, you'll be disappointed. She is a real heroine: a tiny figure indeed in stature, but a giant woman in will, talent and passion. The sensation you get while reading is just that of an extraordinary family, one who produced three world class writers. I've always thought that the sadness of the three sisters' common destiny and the solitude of their almost secluded lives make their achievements even more astonishing: their vivid imagination and their talent gifted readers with tales which were completely different from everything that had ever been written before.

She grew up fairly sheltered, with a trip to continental Europe providing her only real life experience outside of the English countryside. While studying in Brussels, she fell deeply in love with one of her professors, but to her great sorrow, her love remained unrequited. She drew upon the passion and dreams of this period, as well as her own fertile imagination, to write \"Jane Eyre.\" Charlotte and her sisters and brother amused themselves while growing up by creating numerous stories with original fantasy characters. These magical early tales, and their abilities to create them, gave rise to the stories each sister would publish in young adulthood. Tragically, they all died young; their brother never fulfilled the early promise of his own writing talents. The world is left to wonder what other great volumes of literature we could have enjoyed if only Emily, Anne, and Charlotte were able to continue writing.I came away from this book with a strong respect for the often difficult circumstances of Charlotte Bronte's life. She watched her beloved sisters and brothers die of disease at a young age. Charlotte was left to care for her often difficult father. She finally found love after marrying Arthur Nicholls, the curate from her father's rural parish. It's especially sad that they had very little time with each other. Arthur loved her deeply, though his affection was returned only after they were married.

While her eventual marriage to Nicholls does, obviously, come into the book, there is little of it in the first 300+ pages of a 416 page book. It's well written, and I enjoyed it. It's - not surprisingly - quite depressing, given the Bronte family's ability to die in unfortunate ways at a very young age. On the whole, it was more like an easy-to-read biography than a novel.

I developed a real soft spot for Arthur and Patrick Bronte as I felt their heartache through so much loss. They are great examples of perseverance and endurance to the very end of their lives.

She used third-person omniscient, and at times the narrator seems so detached and above it all, particularly when trying to summarize a lot of material or provide a significant flashback.

Honest truth is what she aimed to reveal in her life and to her readership. Usually when an author takes liberties to devise a fictional account of another's life, it's poorly written, cheesy, and extremely wild and romantic in its imaginings. Sometimes the truth is twisted to fit the author's wish for a better outcome. This happens constantly with Jane Austen, but so far I've read two books (including this one) that portray Charlotte Bront\u00eb as true to life as possible based on literary and academic scholarship (the other: Jude Morgan's \u200bCharlotte and Emily\u200b), no frills added, and so strikingly similar to one another and all the research that, to a fan and Bront\u00eb scholar, must speak the truth.And for that, I have to say this is one of my favorite books.Charlotte led such a hard life and I find her and the family utterly fascinating. They each desired love and affection, passions that would throw them off their feet, and yet also desired to be reclusive and alone. This duality speaks to me as an individual - and for someone who may not feel the same, Gael did an excellent job describing Charlotte's dilemmas. Not a moment of the book was rushed, which is such a blessing. This spans across a decade of Charlotte's life, and everyone who shaped her eventually shaped her novels. The influence is key to every moment of her life, and any subject - such as her crush on her publisher, the way she snubbed the curate and later fell in love, the way she portrayed herself to various friends in her letters - was given its proper justice and detail.Academic and literary truth aside, it was still vastly entertaining! We learn more about Emily, Anne, and Branwell; the insecurities Charlotte felt about her appearance; the overbearing clergyman father; the duties of the curate Arthur; the stardom the \"Bell brothers\" faced and who they met - far more interesting than reading a biographical description! The language is beautiful as well, and truly mimics the way Charlotte wrote in her letters. Each character had a distinct personality without exaggeration, and despite knowing how everyone's story ended, I was anxious to see how it would be written. An author that tackles a topic wherein the reader already knows the ending is certainly an author to admire - the fact Gael kept me on the edge of my seat deserves an award!Finally, I'm so glad Gael gave life and breath to Arthur. She had little information to work from, but what information she had were derived from first-hand accounts recorded by Charlotte and Arthur's friends and neighbors. The language of the time would suggest criticism or flattery, and I think Gael did a wonderful job of shaping just the right kind of man he must have been. He was no random, ordinary man who waltzed into the home and asked for her hand in marriage; no, he was there throughout all of her joys and sorrows, on the edge, waiting for the perfect moment, and gave her the happiest last few months of her life.Fantastic book. Utterly beautiful."}, {"userName": "Pkc181", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2660350-pkc181", "userReview": "I anticipated enjoying this book even though I did not really hope to learn anything new about Charlotte Bronte or her immediate family (most notably her sisters Emily and Anne and their \u201cdifficult\u201d father, the Reverend Patrick Bronte). As an avid Bronte fan, I\u2019ve read quite a few biographies on the Brontes, including what I consider to be the definitive work on the family \u201cThe Brontes\u201d by Rebecca Fraser. I picked up this book primarily because I was intrigued on how the author would present Charlotte\u2019s love life, as the title suggests, as the centerpiece of the action. First-time author Gael does not disappoint, competently covering Charlotte\u2019s passionate feelings for the few men in her life outside her family: first her French professor, then her handsome London publisher and finally the man whose love she finally accepts, the curate Arthur Nicholls.This book covers the last 10 years of Charlotte\u2019s life when everything is just beginning to happen for her and her sisters. She\u2019s written \u201cJane Eyre\u201d and against all odds gotten it published to acclaim. She is swept off to London on what today we\u2019d call a publicity tour where she gains a wider perspective on the world beyond the desolate Haworth and is presented with life options that challenge her to decide what it is, exactly, that she wants out of life. The well-known facts that round out Charlotte\u2019s & her family\u2019s life during this period are deftly handled and melded into an engrossing fiction that kept me turning the pages even though I knew how the action would end.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised to find how moved I was by this debut novel that truly brought several members of this extraordinary literary family alive much more than some of the more detail-laden biographies I\u2019ve read. I was especially impressed by how the author presented a full emotional portrait of both Emily Bronte and the stoic Arthur Nicholls. The author grants us more than a little insight as to why Emily was the way she was and would produce something as dark and passionate as \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d as compared to her more demure sisters Charlotte & Anne. And when it comes to Arthur Nicholls, this is the first time I\u2019ve read any book with him presented as something more than an empty shell of a devoted clergyman. Finally we get a realistic and sympathetic portrait of the full flesh and blood man who ends up marrying Charlotte near the end of her life. The author makes a convincing case for why Charlotte would end up choosing to marry Arthur Nicholls at this point in her life when, as a successful author, she had choices in life. For this revelation alone, I would recommend reading this book.Based on her showing with this debut novel, I am really looking forward to see what author Juliet Gael does next."}, {"userName": "Hooma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2335089-hooma", "userReview": "I devoured this book - I could not put it down and I enjoyed every moment of it. Reading this book has inspired me to read the writings of other famous 18th century British female novelists.I learned so much about Charlotte Bronte from this novel and even though this text falls into the category of historical fiction, the key characters and events are accurate and project a very real picture of who Charlotte Bronte was and the kind of life she lived.This statement may sound a bit cliche, but this book inspires one to follow their dreams. Charlotte, who had few if any role models in the form of a female writer nevertheless followed her passion and refused to be deterred. Her only reviewers when she was writing were her two sisters, Emily and Anne. She managed to write in extremely difficult conditions -- financial constraints, illness, the presence of a difficult father and an alcoholic and drug addict brother. Because she was a woman she wrote under the pen name of \"Currer Bell\" and for a long time hid the identity of her work from the public, including her father and brother. Despite devastating setbacks in her personal life and scathing reviews from critics and fashionable London society, she managed to keep writing and remained true to her work. Bits and pieces of Charlotte's own life appear in her writings and this book identifies them. It becomes apparent that so much of Charlotte's own life experiences are interwoven in the novel she wrote.I found it especially funny that Jane Eyre was considered a \"naughty novel\" for its time, because Jane freely confesses her romantic feelings for Mr. Rochester. Apparently, a woman of good breeding and of a certain social class would never do such a thing. Despite the criticism Charlotte received on this point, she held steadfast and did not change her opinion or her writing to conform to what other people thought was appropriate.It saddened me deeply to see Charlotte's genius cut short by her death at a very young age; nevertheless, during her short lifetime, she wrote some of the most enduring novels of the time period.For fans of historical fiction and who are fascinated by classical novelists, this is a great read. It is inspiring and full of rich imagery and detail that will be sure to satisfy your appetite for the backstory of the author's life."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "\u2018If you could only be content with mortal love \u2013stripped of all delusion.\u2019This novel begins with the arrival in Haworth of Arthur Bell Nicholls, Patrick Bront\u00eb\u2019s new curate. It is 1845, and the four surviving Bront\u00eb siblings (Charlotte, Branwell, Emily and Anne) are all living in Haworth Parsonage with their father. Charlotte has returned from her time in Brussels, and her experience there and her attachment to Constantin Heger, partly define the woman we meet in the pages of this novel.By the time the novel opens, Branwell is in disgrace and has turned to drink and opium. Caring for him and supporting their father occupies the sisters physically, but not emotionally. As children, the Bront\u00eb siblings had created and written about imaginary worlds. As adults, Charlotte, Emily and Anne still wrote. Reading some of Emily\u2019s verses is a catalyst for Charlotte\u2019s dream of publication, which leads to a new world of possibility.Charlotte may be the central character in this novel, but it is Arthur Bell Nicholls who shines. Those familiar with the Bront\u00eb story will know the chronological details of their lives and deaths. Those unfamiliar with the detail will get a good sense of who they were from this novel. I\u2019d like to imagine that Charlotte found the kind of happiness with Arthur Bell Nicholls that Ms Gael writes of in this novel. There are challenges in writing novels that involve real people, especially real people as beloved as the Bront\u00ebs. I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with Ms Gael\u2019s portrayals of Patrick and Anne, but while that impacts on my overall enjoyment of the novel it doesn\u2019t detract from Ms Gael\u2019s portrayal of Charlotte. If you are interested in the Bront\u00ebs, whether you have read their novels and poetry or not, this is an enjoyable novel.

The title of this book, Romancing Miss Bronte, is something of a misnomer, since this poor woman actually experienced very little in the way of romance. The Bronte sisters who became writers lived with their minister father in the remote moors of Yorkshire, in a bleak stone house on the very edge of a graveyard. To understand the impact of environment upon their lives, it is only necessary to read Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights; these ladies took no poetic license in conveying the essence of the desolation of such a place in the days when transportation options were limited. Juliet Gael does nearly as good a job, not only with environment but also with the characters, as she dramatizes the closeness of their years together. Patrick Bronte, the family\u2019s patriarch, is particularly well represented, and I don\u2019t mind saying that I was surprised at the selfishness with which he treated his daughters, good girls all, and devoted to his well being. Also, it is easy to forget that, until the twentieth century, it was extraordinarily difficult for a woman to find both a publisher and acceptance from the reading public; what the Brontes wrote was considered daring and shocking, even when it was generally believed that the authors were men. But these three managed to do just that, although, sad to say, neither Emily nor Anne lived to enjoy their success. But, toward the end of her life (which was unforeseen at the time), Charlotte finally found some genuine happiness.
