Sure we get the usual hand jobs, blow jobs and make out sessions but except for a delicious \u201cedging\u201d scene (yup, learn something new every day in my M/M romances) our hero \u201cmakes love\u201d and leaves the rest to our imaginations. Kinda refreshing. Blue Paradise also gives us a creepy stalker plotline \u2013which I didn\u2019t see coming, and our hero is a professional baseball player. Yum! And wasn\u2019t it fun going behind the scenes with him; locker rooms, agents, groupies etc. Giving me flashes of For Love Of The Game (without Kevin Costner) as he tries to break Barry Bonds homerun record on a failing knee. I should also mention the awesome Florida setting here; so well written that I could actually feel the humidly, smell the salt air and see the swaying palms. Total escapism and I loved it. This was a big hit for me and I\u2019ll definitely be seeking out more from Theo Fenraven.Professional baseball player Devin Carter is nursing a bad knee, benched by the team doctor he\u2019s hoping a week\u2019s rest in the Florida Keys will be just what his mind and body need to help him break the home run record when he returns for the remainder of the season. With no true direction in mind Devin just grabs his dog and hits the road, eventually checking into a non-descript hotel bungalow on the beach. It\u2019s there at the Blue Paradise that Devin meets Jim, the grandson of the owner and the man he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s been looking for. Their affair is short lived but meaningful and when Devin returns to Sarasota they decide to keep it going over the phone. There isn\u2019t any angst or unnecessary drama between Devin and Jim; it\u2019s all very mature (that aspect has been saved up for Jorge.) Devin is still in the closet when it comes to the media and his teammates but otherwise quite secure in his sexuality so even though he\u2019s never fooled around with a teammate before when the opportunity presents itself - and with Jim\u2019s open minded blessing, he forges into unknown and potentially messy territory with the team\u2019s new outfielder. And that\u2019s when things get really interesting.For a novella I managed to I got way caught up in the stalker aspect of this story and the utter helplessness Devin feels as his life crumbles around him. He can\u2019t even go to his coach or the police without coming out, however as the violence escalates he also runs out of options. The bad guy here is nothing new or special but he still managed to make me hate him while upping the suspense level. My only real complaint here would be Dev and Jim\u2019s initial meeting which just felt a little too easy and convenient but hey what do I know about gay hook ups?Lastly I have to give a shout out to Rusty the dog who manages to get quite a bit of realistic page time. So much so that when the stalker starts threatening him I actually said to myself (and the author) you better not hurt the dog or I\u2019m gunna stop reading and when I start talking to my books I know it\u2019s good.

Devin has four days of vacation and most of it, he spends it with Jim. It's insta connection, though I can't say it's insta love (no I love you's being said.Then, when Devin returns to play the game, because of the long-distance situation between him and Jim, Devin decides to have gratification sex with one of the new players on his team ... Now, I can't call really this cheating, because Theo Fenraven, SMARTLY, makes Devin and Jim agree on this beforehand. Devin asks Jim about the new player hitting on him, and Jim thinks since they're in separate place (geographically), they don't make any promise or state that they're boyfriends, than they are both free to act on it. Like I said, SMART :).This is when the story picks up, because the new player is a ... well, PSYCHO!!! He ends up stalking Devin, making threats, even ending Devin's career. It moves into mystery-suspense area here ... and it helps the rather slow-pace beginning.The writing is okay, I guess, though I'm don't feel a lot of emotion in it. I mean, Devin loses his career because of the stalker, but I can't feel him being bummed or depressed about it. So I wonder if he has any love at all for the game. By the way, that last couple paragraphs of the epilogue? Suspenseful!PS: Four times use of the word \"non sequitur\". I wonder if that is a word people commonly used in conversation :)"}, {"userName": "Anke", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2845457-anke", "userReview": "Off to the DNF shelf with this book. The whole story was totally unbalanced, unbelievable and over the top. It started rather nice and compelling with both MCs meeting and realizing a connection. Then Devin had to leave and still they decided to keep in contact and to pursue the relationship. Then the first unmotivated thing happened - Devon starts a fling with Jorge and Jim is ok with it? Sorry, but I cannot follow that. From then on it moved into the totally unbelievable territory. The deteriorating behavior of Jorge was excessive and at 81% I just couldn't read on. I know I probably missed a very sweet, equally over the top happy ending, but sorry, this story wasn't for me and I couldn't take it any longer."}, {"userName": "Susan65", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5340638-susan65", "userReview": "[ when he and Devin were attacked (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Helena Stone", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31530338-helena-stone", "userReview": "I received my copy from the author.It is a well known fact I\u2019m a huge fan of Theo Fenraven\u2019s writing. He can do things with words other people, myself included, can only aspire to. In one sentence he\u2019ll give you a description others would need a full paragraph for. He consistently draws me into the world he\u2019s created and by the time I\u2019m ready to leave again his characters and the issues they\u2019ve faced have become a part of me as if I was there, experiencing the whole thing with them.The Flamboyant Flamingo was no exception to that rule. We\u2019re introduced to Devin and Jim, two young men who stand out because at first glance there\u2019s nothing too remarkable about them. They\u2019re nice, considerate and tolerant. And before you think that makes them or the story boring, let me put you straight. For me it was a wonderful change of pace to read a book in which neither of the main characters had huge personal issues or past ordeals to overcome. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with books in which that is the case, but it is nice to occasionally read about characters who just get on with life, like I do myself most of the time. JOf course it\u2019s not quite that simple or this would indeed be a boring story. For starters Devin is a baseball player getting very close to beating the existing record for homeruns. As a result he\u2019s become something of a minor celebrity, a distinction he wears reluctantly.Jim is a student getting ready for his master\u2019s when the grandfather who\u2019s been raising him since his parents died, gets ill and Jim\u2019s plans get thrown into disarray.When the two men meet, the attraction is more or less instant but it isn\u2019t long before Devin\u2019s career and Jim\u2019s obligations in the resort, which he runs with his grandfather, force the two men to separate. They agree to stay in contact but no strings attached. As a result the situation gets dicey and what would have been a gentle and easy going romance turns into a toe-curling thriller. I read the second half of this book with my heart in my throat and may have muttered \u2018don\u2019t you dare\u2019 a few times while turning the pages.Most of the sex scenes in this book manage to be very enticing while fading to black; which makes the one on page scene all the hotter. And while I never miss the sex when I read books by this author, that particular scene suddenly made me wish he\u2019d indulge a bit more often. A well written sex thing in the right hands is indeed a thing of beauty.A funny thing happened after I finished the book. It\u2019s not unusual for the characters in a book I\u2019ve loved to linger in my head and continue their story in my imagination. It is far less common for them to become more rather than less vibrant in my mind. At the time of writing this review two days have gone by since I finished the book and Devin and Jim not only still occupy my thoughts, they are getting stronger and louder as well. This is a new and rather fascinating experience.I still bless the day I first discovered Theo Fenraven\u2019s books. He is one of the few authors I know who can successfully switch from (sub)genre to (sub)genre and make each of them his own while never losing his unique voice. It really doesn\u2019t matter what this author is writing about, what genre he\u2019s visiting or where the story\u2019s set; each work is original and one-of-a-kind and yet quintessential Fenraven. A rare gift indeed."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3017801-andrea", "userReview": "(This is not my usual kind of book to review, so please take note of the tags so you're not surprised, but it's so very very worth looking into.)I really liked this story, though I wish it had been longer. The setting (in Florida) really added to the plot, giving it a carefree, sultry feel that I would love to find on any vacation.But I also love my stories to have a twist, and boy did this one. When Devin and Jim met, it was sweet and no pressure, just two guys finding out about the other one. The attraction was paced well, and despite their chemistry, it was believable to me that, given the long-distance aspect they faced, they'd not make themselves exclusive to each other. That's a fast way to become frustrated, in my opinion, and having had long distance relationships before, I know of what I speak.Enter Jorge, one of the outfielders on Devin's baseball team. So very hot at first, but it's clear up front they're not very compatible. When his sneakiness turns suspicious, I wanted to shout at Devin to run far, far away. Of course, the doof didn't listen to me, to almost disastrous results.As an aside, I've had the knee injury Devin suffered and it's no walk in the park. When the author described it happening in detail, I threw up in my mouth a little, the description is that dead on. And the ending, seriously... I turned green. But that's a mark of a great story, to have me that absorbed, wanting to shout at my Kindle and getting nauseated by something I read. Well done, Theo Fenraven. Well done."}, {"userName": "Jaycee Edward", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25363049-jaycee-edward", "userReview": "I read this story in its original version, (ie: The Blue Paradise) and I recalled enjoying it, though I\u2019m one of those people who don\u2019t remember most of what they read a few days after reading it. So, when Theo asked me to beta read the revised story, The Flamboyant Flamingo, I agreed. \u201cThis is the baseball player one, right?\u201dI\u2019m not a huge baseball fan, but there\u2019s just enough of a baseball backstory to be interesting without delving into stats and stuff that I simply don\u2019t care about. The Flamboyant Flamingo begins with Devin Carter on a much-needed break, trying to escape the cameras and crowds that are part and parcel when you\u2019re a professional baseball player chasing, and about to catch, the world homerun record. Shortly after checking into his cabin at an isolated, quaint Florida resort, Devin meets Jim, the owner\u2019s grandson.There\u2019s no insta-love here \u2014 that\u2019s not Fenraven\u2019s style. What we do get, is a much more realistic, mutual attraction that gradually grows into something \u2018more,\u2019 but Devin has a very public life and isn\u2019t \u2018out\u2019 as a gay man and Jim is studying to get his Master\u2019s Degree, so the timing is all wrong. Once Devin\u2019s break is over, it takes very little discussion before both men agree; they need to continue on their separate paths, yet want to keep in touch and possibly reconnect sometime in the future.Without giving spoilers, they never actually \u2018disconnect\u2019 and when Devin begins what\u2019s meant to be a casual \u2018thing\u2019 with Jorge, a fellow baseball player, things heat up \u2014 and not necessarily in a good way \u2014 for our characters, at least \u2013 although there\u2019s some pretty hot moments. Let me just say, you\u2019ll want to have everything in your life caught up by the time you get to this part \u2014 trust me on this. I really can\u2019t say more without giving away key elements of the story, but there\u2019s a lot of drama and action. Through all the upheaval, the one constant in Devin\u2019s life, is Jim. His calm voice on the other end of the phone and almost Vulcan-like logic are a lifeline to Devin and he hangs on for all he\u2019s worth.After reading this version, I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you what\u2019s been added, deleted or changed. As I said, I don\u2019t retain that kind of info, but I honestly don\u2019t remember The Blue Paradise being such a rich story. I don\u2019t remember feeling so frustrated on Devin\u2019s behalf as he struggles to deal with Jorge. I don\u2019t remember Jim being so wonderfully sensible and grounded. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, though. Theo Fenraven always writes characters that speak to me within moments of their introduction. Devin and Jim are no different.But, here\u2019s the thing\u2026 I don\u2019t read Theo\u2019s work for the story. I know he\u2019ll give me an entertaining story. I read Theo for this:\u201cMissed the sunset,\u201d Jim commented, looking toward the darkening ocean. The dock had been strung with lights, which glowed through the trees. \u201cRelationships must be hard for you.\u201d\u201cNon sequitur,\u201d Devin said, amused.\u201cYeah, I tend to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry. My mind is very active and jumps around a lot.\u201d\u201cAlready noticed that. I think I can keep up.\u201d Devin was gay, and he was pretty sure Jim was, too. The chemistry was there, crackling quietly between them. A muffled shriek of laughter floated to them from another cottage, yet he felt happily isolated from everyone else. Sitting with Jim, drinking wine, and listening to the water caress the sand was relaxing.I read Theo\u2019s books because every single time I do, I\u2019m right there with the characters. I don\u2019t interrupt and they never feel my presence, but I\u2019m sitting right there, beside Jim and Devin, looking at that darkening ocean, feeling the chemistry build between them, hearing that distant laughter on the breeze as I watch the dock lights while I listen to them talk. I don\u2019t simply read Theo\u2019s words \u2014 I experience them.Oh, and the cover? Don\u2019t even get me started. Still waiting for a t-shirt with that cover on it. The cover is glorious and it\u2019s perfect, but if you want to know how The Blue Paradise became The Flamboyant Flamingo, you\u2019ll just have to grab the book and experience it for yourself. You won\u2019t regret it."}, {"userName": "Suze", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8193597-suze", "userReview": "I liked this read, its a short-ish, well written story about a baseball player whose career, and life, is put in jeopardy by a risky short term affair with a team mate. Some may not like how Devin got into his difficulties, but hey, wouldn't have a story then!Despite the menace of Jorge, this was a fairly warm, light read for me - maybe it was all the warm Florida sunshine! I liked the romance between Jim and Devin, though most of it was by phone and whilst there are some sex scenes, they are quite light and mostly implied, which I was fine with.The story moved along at a good pace and though Jorge was a menace, he happened more in the background - except right at the end, and in the epilogue! Will we know more??7.10.15 reread : bought this edition as the revamped Flamboyant Flamingo - great new cover and I'm told some revisions (though I am not going to compare side by side!). I had read Blue Paradise a few times and enjoyed it each time. This feels a tighter read and is updated for marriage equality but it is still a great read for me. As said initially, all that Florida sunshine seems to ooze through. from my original comments, the ending has now had some revision and resolution.

And although it was clear who the bad guy was from the beginning, simply because there aren't very many characters in the story, that part of the story played out well. I felt that Jorge\u2019s unraveling was done very well, having read a lot of books with serial killer plots, including their inevitable deterioration; it felt very true to that type of storyline. I did think that Devin could/should have been more devastated by the loss of his career but perhaps that could be covered in another installment since this is a shorter story.I enjoyed Jim\u2019s grandfather; although a somewhat minor character he helped flesh out Jim\u2019s personality. I felt like I was in Florida on a beach while I was reading this as well, never a bad thing!
