This is not what I expected to be. I hoped to find a book in the style of Stargirl (or something novel) and what did I find? A bunch of teens who try to ease their anxieties in their not-so-original vices and a sudden drama which leads to nonsense talking. All hiding, of course, in a couple of beautiful quotes that wrap all the 'inspiring-sites' on the internet, the reason I got to the book and I bet that you too.Boring, it was so so boring. I didn't like the characters. Alaska was unbearable (oh no wait, she was awesome if you were a character too: fantastic girl,beautiful and wonderful and ohmarrymerightnowplease, and she had to be an intelligent woman, so the author made her feminist and an avid reader, to prove she had brains), and there is no need to write about the boys because... booh. The main character was a cronic linnet, who got lost in his difficulties (mostly, not having a girlfriend, such a big problem you see) and searching The Great Perhaps, thing he forgot to do so easily so... What a waste of time!2013 EDIT: almost FOUR years have passed since I read and reviewed Looking for Alaska and I hope nobody expects me to discuss anything related to the book. It's great if you loved the book but I didn't. Maybe at this time of my life I would express myself in a different way but when I wrote this I was convinced of all I said before. After Looking for Alaska, I read other John Green's books. And I loved some of them, like really did. It's sad that Looking for Alaska didn't work for me but I think it is wonderful that it did for you. Not so many books can inspire that kind of passion :_)Thanks everybody for your likes and comments and my apologies for not answering them anymore."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/922495-patrick", "userReview": "My assistant Amanda has been a John Green fan for ages, which is one of the reasons I decided to start giving his stuff a read.

I decided to reply to a few of the comments in my review because the people that don't like my review/rant don't like it for pretty much the same reasons. First, please note there are spoilers. However, the spoilers aren't really spoilers since it doesn't affect your enjoyment or lack of enjoyment if you know the big secret. Nevertheless, a helpful few have pointed out that I have spoilers and I didn't mark them. So are you happy now?Ok, now to another criticism. Many lovely critics bring up the same point- \"maybe John Green just wanted to show a flawed character & you just don't grasp the flawed character\"...blah,blah,blah, I'm paraphrasing here and kinda combining all the criticism.All right I'll bite. Yes, Alaska is flawed. That is obvious. Ok? Did Mr. Green show how Alaska was flawed and resolve either her flaws or how others deal with her flaws if she chose not to change her ways? Nope. Still not buying my argument? Ok. Let's say for the sake of argument, Alaska was a puppy abuser. She goes around kicking puppies. Is her puppy kicking dealt with? Do any of the characters say \"listen Alaska Darling, you kick one more puppy and I'm kicking your ass\"? Ok, maybe that is a bit extreme, how about does Mr. Green have his characters abandon Alaska because she refuses to give up her puppy kicking ways? Nope. I know, you are saying, \"listen, you stupid idiot, Alaska didn't abuse puppies, she only abused other's people's kindness, took advantage of people, emotionally manipulated people and was an all around piss poor person that used her own poor past to lash out\". Oh, ok, I see what you mean, nope, not a puppy kicker...clearly I'm wrong.Below is the old rant/review...enjoyI'm totally going to regret putting this review in and I'll probably change it later but oh...what...the...hell....Poor Alaska. She screwed up in her past. She blames herself for something that happened when she was a child. It caused her to be moody, withdrawn, angry, and unpredictable. It caused her to drink too much, take unnecessary risks, take advantage of other people\u2019s kindness. One minute Alaska was fun, the life of the party, caring, and everyone\u2019s best friend. The next minute, she was the bitch.Poor, poor Alaska. Let\u2019s save Alaska.Give me a break! Alaska acted the way she did because she could. She used her past as an excuse for her destructive behavior. Alaska\u2019s friends enabled Alaska\u2019s behavior because they didn\u2019t stand up to her. In fact, they had destructive behavior that needed to be addressed as well but since this book is called \u201cLooking for Alaska\u201d, I\u2019m going to focus on Alaska.Many people had really shitty childhoods. Many people were physically and mentally abused as children. Many people were left to survive on their own as children\u2026hungry, dirty and alone. These people didn\u2019t grow up to use their bad childhood, their own guilt, or their past mistakes to act out, take advantage of other people, or to basically treat people like crap.I\u2019m not uncaring. Far from it. I have a ton of compassion. I\u2019m too caring. But being a victim does not excuse your behavior. Being a victim does not justify your behavior. You still have to treat people with kindness, compassion, love, and honesty regardless of what struggles you survived. Get help, and then move on.If someone is treating you wrong, call them on it. Don\u2019t look into their past to try to explain away their behavior. That is BS. It isn\u2019t quirkiness, it isn\u2019t moodiness, it is abuse.So dear Miles aka Pudge, why are you seeking Alaska\u2019s forgiveness? You did nothing wrong except failing to recognize Alaska\u2019s destructive behavior and failing to get away from it.If a person is friendly, kind, caring one minute, but then angry, withdrawn the next, THEY have a problem.If a person is drinking too much, partying to hard, ignoring authority, breaking the rules, THEY have a problem.If you are trying to figure the above-mentioned person out, if you are trying to solve that person\u2019s problems, figure out why they are the way they are, YOU have a problem.I\u2019m off my pedestal now. I\u2019m going to probably change this review once I stop being so irritated but for right now, I\u2019m rolling with it. And if I didn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d the true meaning of the book, well, I\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t want to \u201cget\u201d it. I don\u2019t care. Alaska sucked as a friend and she was a lousy human being, and she took up too much of my time by reading the book."}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/689186-todd", "userReview": "Wow. I must've skipped a bunch of pages or read the Hebrew translation or was having root canal or something because that was one terrible book. All those awards-- WHAT??? Such a clumsy story\u2014 every move of the author was heavy-handed and so transparent I felt like I was a fly on John Green's ceiling watching him go \"Oh that's good-- oh that's just precious\" and fall asleep in his soup again. Miles\u2014I mean \"Pudge,\"as he is deemed within minutes of his arrival at his School of Great Perhaps\u2014 may be looking for Alaska throughout this story but I sure knew her right away. She's the pretty girl who's even prettier because she's a bit damaged and makes you feel like you have a chance with her because she's a flirt. Yes, she's a hopelessly thin character, as are they all (with the exception of The Colonel). Takumi, for example, who is supposed to be one of the Big Four around whom this story revolves, is completely characterized by his unrealistic rap improvs (\"My rhymin' is old school, sort of like the ancient Romans/ The Colonel's beats is sad like Arthur Miller's Willy Loman\") and basically disappears from the story until required by the plot to re-emerge with More Information. Lara, Pudge's first girlfriend, is so bland she is given a Russian accent complete with long e's for short i's (\"I put the stuff een the gel... and then I deed the same thing een Jeff's room\") to prevent her from evaporating off the page and into THEEN ARE. In fact, each character is carefully provided with a shtick, often a savant-like \"talent\" that would in reality win game shows but is meant to be That Thing That Makes Him Special: The Colonel can remember capitals of countries to the point of extreme autism! Pudge knows the last words of famous people\u2014 only he's so doggone quirky that he reads the biography but not the work of the famous person! And our precious Alaska? She keeps stacks and stacks of books in her room that she intends to read (when she's done selling cigarettes to high school kids, I guess), called her life library (or something), but has wrestled with life's Big Questions alongside some very Heavy Thinking Authors, and can recite poetry, of course. Everybody is way too philosophical and literary for their own good, but god forbid the reader is allowed to think. Lest you miss the point, every moment is interpreted for you: I finally understood that day at the Jury: Alaska wanted to show us we could trust her. Survival at Culver Creek meant loyalty, and she had ignored that. But then she'd shown me the way. She and the Colonel had taken the fall for me to show me how it was done, so I would know what to do when the time came Ok, then\u2014I guess that's what happened, except that's just not the way high school kids work.Even word choice reveals fear we won't get it; if an author has to tell you FIVE TIMES in the book that the character \"deadpanned\" instead of \"said\" (the Colonel\"deadpanned\" three times and Pudge, just a little less dry I guess, \"deadpanned\" twice) then either the dialogue is not written well or the author believes it is not written well. (The former, at least).So just hanging with these kids leaves one searching for a third dimension, but then the story itself pretty much jumps genres halfway through, from slacker-YA-Holden-mentioned-on-the-back-cover to straight mystery. Why'd she do what she did? Lest I \"spoil\" this story for you, I won't go into this part, but suffice it to say the above question is left out in the sun to rot while we are forced to look on, sniffing the decay. The story doesn't work in any genre anyway. I know what the story is supposed to do\u2014 make me fall in love with Alaska, feel all warm and cozy when the four friends smoke cigarettes, shoot the breeze, and look out for one another, and care when one of them screams with cosmic agony, but alas. Maybe if I wasn't basically tapped on the shoulder and demanded these reactions I would be better at having them, but lines fall flat and soggy like cigarettes tossed casually into some cliche prep-school lake:The Colonel let go of my sweater and I reached down and picked up the cigarettes. Not screaming, not through clenched teeth, not with the veins pulsing in my forehead, but calmly. Calmly. I looked down at the Colonel and said, \"F\u2014 you.\"My first Kindle read, too!"}, {"userName": "Sarah \u2764", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10822409-sarah", "userReview": "I'm going to explain my emotions about this book in a billion of gifs because I love this book too much to put into words <3So first I was like... because Pudge was pretty cool.Then we met the Colonel, and I did thisbecause the Colonel is awesome! and he got my approval.Then we met Alaska and I gobecause, who knows?

It was given to me in 2007 when I had no idea who John Green was. I wish this book had been around when I was a teen. I really enjoyed the story, but I think I would have liked it even more if I wasn't already past that point in my life. Even still, I loved this book.Miles is in search for the great perhaps, and has a fascination with famous last words. He meets Alaska Young who is basically the girl of his dreams. Their journey together at boarding school begins and John takes us on an exciting ride in which you constantly feel there is impending doom lurking ahead. I'm going to keep this review short, because so much has been said on this book. The writing is as great as I always expect now from JG, and the story unfolds with a great pace that makes you never want to put the book down. You will probably feel some excitement, sadness, and maybe even a little anger reading this book, but I think this book will be memorable. This is an outstanding coming-of-age novel that doesn't resort to a \"happily ever after\" ending, but the characters each seek closure on their own terms. The characters are well drawn, witty, and full of individual quirks. This book also includes some fun pranks, some great humor, and some shocking turns of events. I loved the \"before\"/\"after\" and the whole countdown. I thought that was a really neat tool that helped build suspense.Looking For Alaska is a book I still love and recommend years later, and occasionally still think about. It remains my favorite JG book, and I would like to personally thank the person who gave me this book for introducing me to this wonderful writer.Recommend to everyone, really!"}, {"userName": "Kat (Lost in Neverland)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5749698-kat-lost-in-neverland", "userReview": "First time hearing about this book;Friend online gushes on how amazing and fantabulous this book is.

That was shown here in the Philippines when I was in my first year of working after college and I was able to relate to many of its characters so I watched it twice or thrice. Oh well, I was with my girlfriend then and you know how dark and cold were the theatres during those years when they were not yet inside the malls.So, now at 47, graying and with joints aching especially during cold mornings, I am just too old to appreciate a story about a bunch of young (college) kids who get into all troubles precisely because they are young. They drink booze, smoke, defy school rules, swear, have free sex and, in their attempt to cover their foolishness, do various kinds of franks towards the school authorities.I definitely had my share of foolishness when I was at their age. I guess it had something to do with being young \u2013 the feeling when you want to assert myself, make a territorial mark between your generation and that of your parent\u2019s or test the extent of their patience (and in so doing test whether they really care or not). Last Sunday, my daughter had an outburst inside the car saying that she did not have a friend at school. My daughter who was very active in school leading the Robotics Team, emceeing school programs, leading the daily prayer as one of the school DJs, being class president for at least two years and playing various kinds of sports during annual intramurals. She said that she felt alone (she is an only child) and she oftentimes ate lunch alone. My wife and I felt sad about her revelations. We thought that she was doing fine as whenever we were in her school, we oftentimes heard many of her fellow students greeting her \u201chi.\u201d We even joked that she should be the most popular student in school. This was something that I and my wife did not experience when we were in high school as we were low-profile people then and even now in our respective life circles. We advised her to just make the most of what can still be done for the rest of the senior year - probably concentrate with a few friends instead of reaching out to all \u2013 as it is just 8 months before graduation. In college, she will probably have a totally new set of friends so she can forge new ties and hope those will be stronger and more lasting. Anyway, friends come and go. Those classmates-friends we had in college tend to stick with us after our school years as we normally land in the same field or industry. Moreover, in the end what really matter are the learnings from each friend we encounter in our lives. Learnings that help us to become better persons as we take our journey in this thing called life.That\u2019s why I was able to relate to this novel. I could imagine the disappointment Miles \u201cPudge\u201d Halter felt when nobody but two attended his goodbye party for him. That\u2019s why I could imagine the anxiety he felt facing his own \u201cGreat Perhaps\u201d when he made his first step towards the boarding school, Culver Creek. That\u2019s why I felt the pain and suprise when he was thrown off the creek just because he was sharing his room with Chip \u201cThe Colonel\u201d Martin. That\u2019s why I understood when Pudge and Chip cried with guilt and sadness with longing and fondness when Alaska Young disappeared from their lives.This is a novel about being young and what goes with it \u2013 emotionally vulnerable, trying to fit in, trying to find one\u2019s place under the sun, trying to face the whole world armed with what little knowledge and strength gained in the first one or two decades of stay on this treacherous yet still beautiful earth.John Green shows us the generation of today. His characters may not be totally different from the St. Elmo\u2019s buddies I used to relate with. However, this is their time. We had ours. So, let\u2019s step down and give them the stage but keep ourselves at bay to coach if they ask us to. Otherwise, let\u2019s leave them and let them strengthen their wings for them to fly away and fulfill the hearts\u2019 wishes.Thanks to Dra.

This is exceedingly rare for me, but it's just that bad.Our hero, Miles Halter, is a weird, spoiled kid who likes reading the ends of biographies just to get people's last words. He doesn't always even read the whole book, just the ending. Miles thinks this habit makes him deep. Miles is wrong.We know Miles is shallow from page 3. He's leaving his public school for a fancy boarding school, and only two friends, Marie and Will, show up to bid him adieu. Miles does not appreciate this gesture because Marie and Will are dorks, theater geeks, and they like Jesus Christ Superstar, which Miles has somehow never heard of but already knows he doesn't like. Also, Will is fat. The horror.Luckily for Miles, he is soon to escape this hellish existence of being forced to socialize with overweight people who don't recoil like demons at the name of Jesus. At his fancy-pants school, he meets Chip \"The Colonel\" his jerk of a roommate, but Chip's alright because he looks like \"a scale model of Adonis\" and he smokes. Then there's Takumi, who's Asian and talks with his mouth full. So far, that is all we know about Takumi, and I have a horrible feeling that that is all we will ever know about Takumi.And then there's Alaska Young- \"the hottest girl in the world\" who introduces herself to Miles by gleefully recounting how she got groped by a random, randy boy over the summer. Alaska is like Miles in that she loves to read (a word which here means \"parse, but pretend to have read the whole thing\") big nonfiction books. Usually girls who like this kind of reading don't boast about their sexual exploits, because they are mature enough not to have any. They also don't drink, smoke, or partake of drugs. But to paraphrase Gandalf at the edge of Mirkwood, this is the John Green-verse, a world that only appears similar to ours, and we're in for all kinds of fun wherever we go. Chip gives Miles the nickname \"Pudge\" because Miles is skinny. Green clearly expects us all to be rolling in the aisles over this one. Green's expectations are way off. The night before school begins, Miles gets abducted from his room while Chip is out. The boys who take him make him a duct tape mummy and throw him in a pond, an ordeal which he miraculously survives. These three guys tried to murder him, but they were thin and attractive and didn't say anything about Jesus, so we're cool.I neither know nor care what happens after this point. From what I've heard, Miles and Alaska make out, despite each already having a girlfriend/boyfriend, and Miles receives a sexual favor of the Bill Clinton variety from his girlfriend while Alaska looks on and gives the girl instructions. Then Alaska goes drunk-driving and dies, prompting an existential crisis on the part of her friends, who wonder if the car crash was a purposeful suicide.They market this book to kids as young as twelve.John Green is not a particularly good writer, despite what you might have heard. His prose isn't bad, but it's hardly the ambrosial poetry it's been marketed as. The supposedly deep thoughts of the kids are clearly tacked on - it's not natural for Alaska to go from \"OMG he honked my boob\" (her words, not mine) to \"General Bolivar wondered 'How will I ever get out of this labyrinth?'\" Every time Miles mentioned his Great Perhaps, I wanted to clobber someone. Nobody on Earth thinks, acts, or talks like this.Green clearly fancies himself a great sage of adolescence, and his characters worthy to keep the company of the best YA protagonists. What he doesn't realize is that the great characters are great because they're not sold to the reader as perfect; rather, they are shown to be real kids with flaws and virtues. A few examples:-Huck Finn (\nThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\n) is a gritty protagonist, but truly gritty, not some pampered rich kid affecting a hard life to evade moral responsibility. Huck is a weather-worn, stained pair of workman's jeans, while Miles Halter and Company are the $425 Nordstrom jeans splattered with fake mud.-Jo March (\nLittle Women\n), like Green's characters, is a bookworm who yearns for more adventure than her small town can provide. But unlike them, she learns the value of temperance, sacrifice, and humility.-Anne Shirley (\nAnne of Green Gables\n) is superficially a lot like a Green character, a precocious reader who loves to show off her big vocabulary and Deep Thoughts. But unlike Green's nihilistic dramatis personae, Anne believes fervently in Goodness - not just in God, while that's big, but in the inherent potential of every human being. She also recognizes her mistakes and learns from them.-Eustace Clarence Scrubb has a lot of Greenish tics. He collects bugs, and he could probably have a good conversation with Miles and Alaska about famous last words and grain elevators. Eustace looks down on his cousins the Pevensies, whom he perceives as stupid, and he keeps a journal, wherein he is the only smart or sane person in a sea of idiots who enjoy the outdoors and talk about Aslan (Christ Superstar). Eustace basically is a Green hero at the start of \nThe Voyage of the Dawn Treader\n, but Lewis sees him as he is - utterly insufferable. What a pity no one could turn Miles Halter into a dragon; it might have been a character-building experience. -Scout Finch (\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n) is extremely observant and intelligent, but unlike a Green kid, never puts on airs about it. She never even really recognizes how different she is from the children around her. She's nine when the story ends, but she's far more mature than Miles or any of his friends.- Meg Murray (\nA Wrinkle in Time\n) is a brainiac who looks and acts like one - a mousy-haired, bespectacled dork with no discernible social life, whose best friend is her (autism spectrum?) little brother. She doesn't degrade the people around her. She just wants to save her family.(The last two examples are from a movie and a TV show, but they're still light-years ahead of anybody in a Green book).- Sarah Williams (\nJim Henson's Labyrinth: The Novelization\n) fancies herself a genius, who's so much better than her peers that she'd rather do one-person plays in the park than interact with other high school kids. She quickly learns that she's not nearly as grown-up as she thought she was, and that by living mentally in a fantasy world, she almost lost her baby brother and got embroiled in a relationship with a rather unstable man that neither she nor he was ready for. Sarah becomes mature when she admits her immaturity. Green's people don't think they have anything to learn.- the entire main cast of \nFreaks and Geeks: The Complete Scripts, Volume 1\n are strange, maladjusted, and alienated from the mainstream like Green's kids are - but in realistic ways. Some of them are drug-addled partiers, others are readers and perceivers. The writers of the show understood that a wild girl like Kim Kelly, who boasts of her Maenadish adventures just like Alaska, would not enjoy reading, while a bright kid like Lindsay Weir would try pot and skipping school, but feel the whole time like she was betraying herself. Green just amalgamates incompatible personality traits without a shred of realism.That's not even getting into the zig-zagging language of the book. Green drops heavy swear words frequently, but thinks the reader needs every bit of real information spelled out for them. At the end of chapter 1, Miles explains to his parents who Francois Rabelais was, despite the fact that his dad owns the book about Rabelais that Miles read. This unnatural dialogue reveals how dumb Green thinks his readers are. It would have been better for Miles-as-narrator to step away from the scene and explain Rabelais briefly to the reader. Alcott, Montgomery, Lewis, L'Engle or Lee would have just had him say \"As Rabelais said on his deathbed...\" and leave it to the reader to find out who Rabelais was. Believe it or not, kids, there was a time when novelists knew you were smart enough to use an encyclopedia!And what of the gratuitous crudity and innuendo in this book? Alaska is utterly objectified. The first time we meet her, she's bragging about getting felt up. To a pair of boys, no less, one of whom she doesn't even know. When she's having a supposedly deep conversation by the pond with Miles, he's more focused on her curves, which he describes over and over again in detail, than in anything she's saying. It's the Male Gaze Run Amok. I understand that men are easily distracted by the bodies of women, especially women as beautiful as we're told Alaska is. But Miles is so filled with lust for her that it's uncomfortable to read about. If I have to read about men looking at women and being horny, I'll stick with Ovid. He can get disgusting, but he's a far superior writer to Green in any translation, and at least in Ovid many of the women do not seek to be objectified. I'll take Apollo/Daphne over Miles/Alaska any day. Also, Metamorphoses boasts such niceties as symbolism, flashes of genuine humor, and explosions.All in all, this is a terrible book which somehow won awards and gained its author a huge, worshipful following. He has since rewritten it many times, changing the characters' names and tweaking the subject matter slightly. All his books pretend to be profound when they're really just paeans to narcissism, nihilism, and bad decisions. His fans gobble this stuff up because it makes them feel special and unique without challenging them to change their lives or examine their characters. Worse, Green's genre can be a slippery slope to other \"profound\" YA novels such as the potentially harmful Thirteen Reasons Why, which in light of its alarmingly popular Netflix adaptation will soon be getting a review from me.

(Less so with An Abundance of Katherines, I must admit, but most of the elements are still there so I\u2019m counting it) In every book (An Abundance of Katherines, Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska) our hero is a slightly awkward but likable young man who has some quirky obsession and quirky friends. He meets a girl, who is your typical Manic Pixie Dream Girl, except on crack. Boy obsesses over Girl, Girl does not give much of a damn. Girl is impulsive and difficult to understand and shows many signs of being mentally unbalanced, but Boy does not care because she is hot. Story continues in this vein for a while, and then Girl does something that causes all hell to break loose, goes totally off the rails, and Boy is left to pick up the pieces and continue worshipping Girl, although not quite in the same way he did before. John Green certainly has a thing for the Manic Pixie Dream Girl archetype, and the good news is he\u2019s starting to ease up on it \u2013 the girls get steadily less crazy and more likable as the books get newer, and since I read the books in the opposite order they were written, it was interesting to watch the escalation. Katherine I is mostly normal, although still a constant source of mystery and worship. Margot Roth Speigleman is Alaska Young on medication. And Alaska Young is...well. I\u2019ve been trying to think of some mythical figure I can compare her to (there\u2019ve got to be a million myths about beautiful women who bring destruction, right?) and the best I can come up with is actually from Peter Pan. Remember the mermaids? They\u2019re beautiful and fascinating and mysterious, and they draw you in with their singing. But the second you get close to them, they grab you and drag you under the water and drown you. Alaska Young is a mermaid. She\u2019s impulsive and fun and sexy and confident, and then as soon as anyone starts feeling comfortable with her, suddenly she becomes sullen or furious or cruel. Miles, the Awkward But Likeable Quirky Boy, doesn\u2019t even try to resist her. He falls, hard, for Alaska and bravely endures her ups and downs, and he suffers for it along with everyone else who was foolish enough to fall in love with her. She stubbornly remains a mystery throughout the book, refusing to explain her actions or moods, and this continues to the moment when she drives off campus, drunk and raging, and ends up driving her car straight into a police car (the siren was on, the lights flashing) that was parked on the highway at an accident site. She is killed instantly, and even after her death Miles and his friends continue to be consumed by her. The book is divided into two parts \u2013 before Alaska\u2019s death, and after. Based on the reviews I\u2019ve read, everyone seems to like the Before better, but I disagree. I like the After, mostly because I couldn\u2019t stand Alaska, but also because I think the writing gets better in the After part. The thing I love about John Green (and the reason this gets five stars, despite my griping) is the way he writes about emotions. That sounds silly, but it\u2019s true \u2013 he understands fear and pain and grief better than almost any author I\u2019ve ever read, and it\u2019s always heartbreakingly beautiful when he writes about them. In my review of Paper Towns I quoted a brilliant paragraph he wrote about fear, and in Looking for Alaska it\u2019s grief: \u201cI am staring at the ground beneath me. I cannot stop thinking that she is dead, and I cannot stop thinking that she cannot possibly be dead. People do not just die. I can\u2019t catch my breath. I feel afraid, like someone has told me they\u2019re going to kick my ass after school and now it\u2019s sixth period and I know full well what\u2019s coming. It is so cold today \u2013 literally freezing \u2013 and I imagine running to the creek and diving in headfirst, the creek so shallow that my hands scrape against the rocks, and my body slides into the cold water, the shock of the cold giving way to numbness, and I would stay there...\u201dThat\u2019s the stuff I love about this book \u2013 the aftermath of the destruction Alaska wreaks. In all the Before sections, it just felt like the characters were stalling for time, waiting for that inevitable disaster to happen. Once it does, I suddenly became completely invested in the book and decided that I needed to give it five stars. \u201c...one thing I learned from science classes is that energy is never created and never destroyed. And if Alaska took her own life, that is the hope I wish I could have given her. Forgetting her mother, forgetting her friends and herself \u2013 those are awful things, but she did not need to fold into herself and self-destruct. Those awful things are survivable, because we are as indestructible as we believe ourselves to be. When adults say \u2018Teenagers think they are invincible\u2019 with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don\u2019t know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We thinks that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail.\u201d Also, for the record: I think she did it on purpose. I don\u2019t think she left campus planning to kill herself, but she saw the police car and decided, on the spur of the moment, to drive straight at it. I think she meant to do it. UPDATE: Whilst dicking around on tumblr, I found a snippet of a poem by Warsan Shire and I had to post it at the end of this review, because I think it perfectly expresses what Alaska would say if she were allowed to tell this story in her own words, and it also illustrates what John Green fails to understand about his Manic Pixie Dream Girl obsession:\"You want me to be a tragic backdrop so that you can appear to be illuminated, so that people can say \u2018Wow, isn\u2019t he so terribly brave to love a girl who is so obviously sad?\u2019 You think I\u2019ll be the dark sky so you can be the star? I\u2019ll swallow you whole.\""}, {"userName": "Lotte", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25309949-lotte", "userReview": "I first read this book in 2008 when I was 14 and it turned out to be the book that sparked my love for literature.I've always loved reading, but before that I only read for the sake of entertainment.

However, it still means the world to me and I'll always be thankful for John Green for writing it."}, {"userName": "Kristopher Jansma", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/191616-kristopher-jansma", "userReview": "I've been getting in touch with my inner Young Adult this week, in preparation for yet another final rewrite on my own YA book. This has, for the most part, amounted to listening to Death Cab for Cutie and reading Looking for Alaska - a book that I have been actively avoiding. The story of this is long and somewhat personal, so feel free to skip this part if you just want to know if the book is good.I first heard of Looking for Alaska in my thesis workshop, when a girl very snidely told me I'd have to take out part of my own book because it sounded very similar to this book she'd heard about on NPR, which had not even come yet out at that point. Stubbornly I refused to cut the section (and even read it at my thesis reading) and when Alaska finally did come out, I flipped through just enough of it to decide my book was way better and then abandoned it. Sadly, Alaska has dogged me ever since. Agents and editors alike have told me that my book is too similar to it - which is apparently not a good thing - despite Alaska having won a number of awards and such. Anyway, sour grapes aside, I decided that if the comparisons are inevitable, I might as well know what I'm being held up against.So what do the young adults of this world really want? Sex, apparently. And a stiff drink or twelve.Looking for Alaska is about normal, skinny Miles Halter, quickly nicknamed Pudge, who gets into Culver Creek Boarding School and leaves in search of something more interesting. His quirky personality trait is that he memorizes the famous last words of various historical figures - a party trick that he uses to successfully get in with his roommate, who goes by \"the Colonel\" and the smoky little sexpot down the hall, Alaska Young. Wait, you might be saying, what's with all these funny nicknames? Well, Alaska turns out to be nearly the only name in the book that isn't a nickname - though we do find out that her parents decided to let her name herself at the age of 5. Even the Dean is referred to as The Eagle by the Culver Creekians. Try as I might I can't recall a lot of excessive nicknaming in my youth. I suppose there were a few guys I knew who pretty much went by their last names, when there were too many Adams or Brians in the bunch. I had one friend who referred to himself as the Emperor... but we didn't really call him that on a daily basis. Anyway, I digress.The story is split into two parts - Before & After - and I won't give away the event that divides the two. All I will say is that the structure and the subject matter reminded me immensely of The Secret History by Donna Tartt (which incidentally was my main inspiration as well...) But just as I felt that the second half of History sags, Alaska does too. It's hard to talk about why without spoiling the twist, so I'll focus my energy on the Before section, which will give you the gist.As I said earlier, Pudge loves Famous Last Words, (this is actually the facet that the snarky workshop girl told me was too close to my own book) and I expected to hate this quirk - but in fact it grew on me. The whole book grew on me - the romantic tension between him and Alaska is perfect, and there are an awful lot of incredibly poignant moments as Pudge grows accustomed to the school and it's strange rules and rhythms. Ultimately the book becomes a youthful meditation on life and death, which made me realize part of the joy of YA writing - just as in the Death Cab songs, the emotions can be laid much barer than in more serious literary works where things always seem to have to stay sort of ambiguous and sophisticated. Teenagers are supposed to be a little melodramatic, and that's sort of the joy of it. Badly done, you get Gossip Girl style antics, a lot of who-cheated-on-whom-with-whomever-else. But rightly done, you get something like the better parts of Looking for Alaska.So what's leftover? A lot of ridiculous stuff. The Colonel and Alaska are more or less perpetually drunk (she buries wine bottles in the woods) and there's a good deal of cigarette smoking going on as well - for which they are occasionally punished. Fellatio is simulated on a tube of toothpaste (then performed in real life). Alaska's big hunky boyfriend from another school comes by frequently and everyone talks racily about how much sex they seem to have and just how much Alaska loves it. Worse than anything, when the characters are good and drunk (which is often) they will break out in absurd, spontaneous, freestyle rapping. In between all the genuine, poignant moments of the book, are a million moments where they're all so jaded and edgy and wacky you almost wish you could reach in and smack all their heads together. Maybe that's just me.A friend of mine who actually went to boarding school observed to me the other day that none of the boarding school books she's ever read (including Alaska, which she did not like) give any realistic idea of the sheer volume of WORK that needs to be done. There's essentially no time leftover to get up to any trouble, she said. At any rate, Culver seems to be a somewhat less romanticised boarding school than the Exeters and Andovers of the world. It's in Alabama for one thing. Most of the rich kids head home on the weekends (leaving only our protagonists to get up to trouble). There's very little sense that any of them feel pressure to do well or accomplish anything extraordinary in life. The overriding question of the book is how one can escape the constant sufferings of life - not suffering like having to work hard or being humiliated or anything - think more like a teenager - it is the suffering of unrequited love, parents that just don't get it, the fear of getting expelled for one's various illicit pleasures, the embarrassment of puking on a girl... etc. Ultimately the book hinges on a more deeply serious moment - the sort that makes this philosophical question really important for them, and puts their previous, childish problems in perspective. However, as I said earlier, this moment comes halfway through, making the final half of the book one very tedious denouement.Ultimately, the good in this book will stick in my mind far more than the bad. The character's absurdities and the shaky structure are both quickly forgotten upon putting the book down. I'm genuinely glad that I read it, and not only because now I have a better idea of what to avoid with my own book. Alaska is a great character, when she's not a little bit over the top. And maybe that's just what being a teenager is all about."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10128373-emma", "userReview": "I was recommended this by a good friend and I was really looking forward to it. I love the vlogbrothers videos and the first chapter really made me want to read it and find out more but it didn't live up to the expectation that the first few chapters set up. My main problem with the book was the characters. It wasn't even that they were underdeveloped. Alaska and Miles just pissed me off. I let some of it slide by because I understand certain parts were intentional but Miles was just so whiny. I couldn't handle it. By the time I got to the \"After\" section of the book I was going through the motions; counting pages, skipping whole paragraphs that seemed unimportant and screaming internally at my book. The took so long to figure out the great mystery of the incident that is didn't seem plausible for a group of teenagers who are supposed to be smart. I have since read another John Green book and I truly loved it. His writing is excellent and it is so refreshing to see a YA novel with a male voice.

Unfortunately, after reading a lot of his work, I can't say that I belong to that fanbase. Neither his characters nor writing nor plot make me swoon. Alright, that was a very formal way of saying that his books are not for me. Now, let's cut to the chase, shall we? Everybody loves to read a good, ol' raging review about a controversial book. But I'll try to keep this one civil. I can understand why Green's books are so popular, even though I don't personally find them anything spectacular. First of all, I noticed a trend in some of his stories. The leading main character is almost always bland and boring, take for example, Paper Towns or this book, Looking for Alaska. Now, I'm not being a bully here and saying that Green is the only one who follows this trope - but, it's just a little observation of mine. You don't have to agree with me. Following that observation, have you realized that similarly in a few cases, the female is always portrayed as this 'mysterious, untouchable' goddess of some sort? The normal, grey-little-piece-of-paper bloke and the otherworldly queen. I get that when people, especially teenagers, fall in love, they idealize their crush, looking past all their imperfections ... but, come on. This trope is overwhelmingly popular in YA. Okay, now think about this. Imagine a bucket full of paper cards with plot twists, character traits, character interests, events, etc. Now, the way I see it, most of Green's books feel like these little cards have been pulled out at random, and the story was based upon them. It's ridiculous, I know. But, that's just how I feel, okay? Now, let's get to the actual book. Looking for Alaska. If I could describe this book in a few random words, it would be: excessive teenage smoking, teenage rebellion, drinking, unlikeable characters. Apart from Chip. I liked Chip. You rock, Chip. I highly appreciate that Green was trying to touch on some important matters. But, I don't think this book did them justice. Let's start. Plot: This book was entertaining to read, in the way that it's wasn't boring, even though it pretty much had no plot. I won't lie. You fly through it. I can't say that I didn't necessarily enjoy reading it - it was chaotic, and crazy and full of that 'teenage rebellion' jazz. Characters: I felt very little towards any of the characters, especially Alaska. The amount of times her body was described is literally insane - like, Miles, get a grip, stop being fickle. I understand that he thought her personality was brilliant too and at that age, teenage hormones go on a raging rampage, but, enough is enough. Even towards the end, I couldn't bring myself to feel any sympathy for either of them. At one point, sure, I felt a little bleak, but no tears were shed. Writing: The writing wasn't bad. It was very simple and bland, and full of vulgar language, but it wasn't something terrible. As usual, it had that 'philosophical' undertone - when young people try to sound all wise - which drives me crazy. I'm not saying that teenagers are stupid, because as a teenager myself, I think that is the most inaccurate, insulting accusation one can make. But, there's a huge disparity between wisdom and intelligence. Okay, now, I'd like to touch on another matter. Smoking. I'm not going to hide it. Teenagers smoke, and that's something that was and most likely always will be part of our society. That's okay. That's life. Lots of my friends smoke, and whilst it's not something that I want to take part in, as an athlete (saying athlete, I don't mean I'm a professional, or anything), I under where its popularity comes from. Really, I do. But...The characters in this book smoke. A lot. That's fine, because it makes the book seem realistic. Damn it, I'm fifteen and I know people my age and younger who smoke. And, truthfully, that's not something society can magically eradicate. But, the way it was depicted in the book made me mad.Not whilst reading it. But looking back at it now... it was very problematic, in my personal opinion. If you have the opportunity to write a book aimed towards a younger audience, wouldn't you want to make a positive impact? Teach them something. But, in this book, smoking was deemed (in my opinion) 'cool' and, honestly, that was something that infuriated me. The characters smoked so much, and nothing happened to them. They were healthy, and didn't cough at all. No effects, whatsoever. Literally, as though smoking was a chill, harmless activity - not full of nicotine and tobacco. Why? WHY? Smoking is life threatening. Why glorify it in a book? This whole theme should have been handled differently, in my opinion. It should have pushed people away from smoking. Writers can create magic through words. As the saying goes, words have the power to change minds. John Green has a huge amount of fans, spread all around the world, and he obviously must have a talent in writing. If you happen to possess two of these things, why not use them to your advantage?Through a beautiful paragraph, people could feel at least feel some distaste towards smoking. It just should have had a better moral; a better message towards readers. A more constructive message, in my opinion. I understand that these teenagers want to experiment, want to try new things, but come on, there's boundaries that shouldn't be crossed. And, when an author touches upon life threatening, addictive substances, I think it would be only fair if he portrayed the action, as dangerous. NOT AS A LEISURELY, FUN ACTIVITY, RESERVED ONLY FOR THE BEST OF THE BEST. Man... Overall, I didn't enjoy this book. Sadly, it just wasn't one for me.

It was super cheap in the closing local Borders. 3. I'm not that original about selecting books. 4. What else are the late hours of the night for if not reading? 5. I wasn't liking much the books I was plumbing through. Looking for Alaska is, if nothing else, readable. Rot & Ruin? Not so much. I wonder how long teen books about boy characters will benefit from my hatred of Rot & Ruin? (Noooo, Mariel, don't! You'll end up having to read another Maberry book. I definitely do not want to read another Maberry book.) The John Green formula (is this is first book? I'm too lazy to look it up) is at play: Colin (from 'Katherines') had his \"eureka\" moments modelled after geniuses in history. Miles favors last words of famous dead people. It was a bit too cutesy for me that he ALSO wanted a \"great perhaps\". Too much emulating, for me. A boy comes to life realizations after a series of events that bring together and then drive apart the young characters. The formula isn't needed for a hook to get into that. However, I did like that John Green wrote about John Adams last words in the afterword. \"Thomas Jefferson still lives.\" He didn't. I only knew about this from an episode of The West Wing (TWW nerds unite!). I like looking into stories about lives because of last words. It didn't really have much to do with Miles's relationships with his friends, though. I guess it was like the comic relief in a Disney film? It's there in case the parents are getting bored... Colin got under my skin. It depressed me that the whole point was being better than everyone else. Miles and his friends are looking for distraction in each other. Solace, yeah, but mostly distraction. Making shit happen so they won't have to think about what they are really doing (or not doing. It IS a boarding school story). Alaska is a teen girl version of Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I've been coming across a few of these lately. Not that I blame them. I adore Clementine. What Clementine had, and Alaska didn't, is enough of a life outside Miles's perspective. Looking for Alaska is supposed to be about FINDING the girl outside of that. Green didn't quite make it there. I appreciated the sentiments, though. It's like watching a funeral of someone you don't know, to me. It sucks that they are dead. I could probably make up a story to myself about what they were like. I could pull it from abstract sources and get carried away with it. How much of it would be based on me? Miles? There's not enough MILES for that. He's kinda generic teen boy. Maybe that's good for the teens who feel this kinda mutual solace in each other for experiencing those teen things. I don't remember feeling part of a larger group. It was a long time ago, though. Nice sentiments though. Dreaming of the future to escape the present? Good one, Alaska. I remember thinking those same things about people being energy that just changes form when I was Miles's age. That's the most religious I ever got. I'm sure I felt smart at the time. (Asshole.) It was cool that Alaska said she smoked to die. Morrissey nod! Okay, if I'm being honest I did feel an extra dab of sympathy for Miles being a Floridian who moves to Alabama. That was me, once. I'll probably not read another John Green book. I don't need the distraction of hijinks right now (maybe some other night). It's hard enough going through life trying to patch together some feeling of humankind by wondering what other people go through. I take it on faith that this shit is hard. Now, what the hell was Alaska really thinking? Because I loved her when she didn't want to answer the whats, whens, whys, hows. Me too. I'm glad that John Green wrote about people who cared about being people for something worth more than being better than other people. It wasn't a waste of time being around them even if I didn't get past the surface we're all in this together stuff. Sentiments are better than beat downs. P.s. John Green probably loves the film Real Genius. I always used it to embarass my dog. \"Where's mama's little soldier!\" (um the part where the geek calls home and the evil kids use it to publically humiliate him.) I have no business picking on this stuff..."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184539-carrie", "userReview": "In Looking For Alaska, John Green tells the story of Miles, a smart, skinny teen who decides to go to the same boarding school his father attended in the hopes of finding a different life. The reader gets a glimpse of what Miles\u2019 home life is like at the beginning of the novel when his mother throws a going-away party for him, and only two people show up. Once at boarding school, Miles quickly befriends his roommate, nicknamed The Colonel. The Colonel introduces him to the rest of his inner circle: Takumi, a rap-loving Japanese boy, and Alaska, a smart, impulsive girl. The group study, plan pranks, blow off steam, and get into mischief together, all while Miles is falling in love with Alaska, who has a boyfriend. The reader is aware that the students are on the path to something life-changing, as the chapters count down days, \u201cForty-Six Days Before,\u201d \u201cThree Days Before,\u201d until arriving at \u201cThe Last Day\u201d a little over half-way into the book. The chapters then begin to count up, \u201cThe Day After,\u201d \u201cTwenty Days After.\u201d Miles and his friends are faced with many questions about just what happened. Could they have prevented what happened, and if so, can they forgive themselves? They try to find the answers to these questions while coming to terms with their loss, grief, guilt, and the need to keep on living. John Green masterfully handles these big questions without making them heavy-handed. He also delves into philosophy through the students\u2019 religions class. Miles often uses this class, and his favorite famous last words quotes, to try to find the answers to some of life\u2019s big questions. Young adult readers will find it captivating and thought-provoking, without feeling like they are being preached to, or being told that these are the only answers available."}, {"userName": "Stephanie *Very Stable Genius*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-very-stable-genius", "userReview": "This review will be somewhat of a spoiler. Don\u2019t read it unless you\u2019ve read the book or don\u2019t want to. You have been warned.\u201cPoof\u2026\u2026\u2026.and you\u2019re gone.\u201dThis was a line in the book that described death, sudden death in particular. It\u2019s sounds just about right to me. It is exactly that. One moment there was a person, full of life, and then the next moment that person ceases to exist. It\u2019s a difficult thing to wrap your head around.In Looking for Alaska there is a sudden, stupid death and I thought John Green told that story perfectly. The reactions of the characters were spot on. Shock, horror, disbelief, anger all come first, mostly its disbelief. In fact, so spot on that it took me right back to a time when this happened to me. It felt like John grabbed a hold of my shoulders and pushed me back in time twenty years. One of the characters said something like \u201cNo, no\u2026.you\u2019re lying . He/she isn\u2019t dead, their playing a joke. It\u2019s not possible their dead, stop lying to me.\u201d I said the same thing to the coroner. Shit like that will change a person. The change is immediate and it\u2019s permanent. I am not the same person I was before that moment, that girl is dead and gone. A big piece of me is missing\u2026\u2026.and in many ways I\u2019m a stuck back there. Which brings me to my one complaint about Looking for Alaska, I thought these characters (I\u2019m trying not to use names, so that I don\u2019t completely ruin it) seem to get back to their scampery and pranks a tad too soon for my taste. I didn\u2019t buy that they would even care about that kind of stuff anymore. But then again, it makes for a better book, having things happen.Overall, this is a very good book and I recommend it to everyone."}, {"userName": "Laz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22313662-laz", "userReview": "\u201cWhen adults say, \"Teenagers think they are invincible\" with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don't know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die. Like all energy, we can only change shapes and sizes and manifestations. They forget that when they get old. They get scared of losing and failing. But that part of us greater than the sum of our parts cannot begin and cannot end, and so it cannot fail.\u201d\nThis is what a call an amazing book. It was nothing less than I expected John Green to write. I loved it so much because it was amazingly well-written and god-help-me these funny cues and the naughty scenes and the dirty vocabulary was so so unexpected from John Green. This was even criticized for the use of vocabulary it it. Loved it.I love Miles, with his scrawny ass and all. I loved the way he evolved into a more mature and grown up kid than he was before. He made friends, he felt pain and lost friends. He met the girl of his dreams and fell in love with her. He lost her, she slipped right through his hands. Miles felt it all in an avalanche of feelings. He got through so much in such a short period of time. I'm not sure I would have able to handle it as well as he did. He's a strong dude and he may not look it but he certainly is an amazing person.Mile made genuine relationships. He was introverted and in a way he got past this, he let people get through his tough exoskeleton. I'm sure he doesn't regret anything, I believe that feels like it was all worth it. I think he came out a better person in the end. Yes, he made mistakes. But who doesn't? And at that age, too.I started reading this expecting.. I don't know what I expected, but it certainly wasn't this. I'm sure John Green is an evil person, who loves creating books such as good as this and The Fault in Our Stars but always adding something that'll break your heart into tiny little particles.. I'm not sure there's another author like him, he can take the most meaningless thing, turn it into something heart-breaking and have you sob before you can spell h-e-a-r-t-b-r-e-a-k.I got so attached to Miles. I'm sure y'all can see my name here on Goodreads. It's more like a tribute to him rather than I simply liked his last name. Miles is one of those characters that you'll feel a profound connection with, I'm sure of it. He's a real and genuine character with flaws. He's a kid with problems, who's not sure about himself, but somehow in this book we can see how can friends influence us.. Sometimes badly, sometimes good.In this book I saw how pigheadedness can turn into something bad in seconds. The simple act of not believing in yourself, in believing less of you, in thinking you're not worth anyone's love.. Not confiding to anyone about the real you, creating a facade for all to see.. Making a shell of your body, closing in all of your feelings & all of your hurt. Don't let yourself do this, help yourself because if you won't help yourself, then how can anyone else help saving you? Forgive yourself, for whatever mistakes you've made, you're young and you still got all the time in the world to correct this mistake & instead make something good out of it. You have this chance, don't let it slip away from you. \n\u201cThe only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/845910-leslie", "userReview": "This is a decent book.
