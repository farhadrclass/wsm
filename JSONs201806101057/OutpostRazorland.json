(Oh, stop trying to run away, I\u2019m not about to start singing for real.) I must admit I was terrified of reading this book, but not because I doubted Aguirre in the least. After reading 11 of her books and loving them all, I know perfectly well what she\u2019s capable of. No, I was terrified because, even before starting it, I knew it would crush me into tiny Maja bits. And it did.There\u2019s a reason for everything, and a million reasons for some things. The list of reasons why Ann Aguirre\u2019s books always affect me so deeply is about three miles long. I\u2019m very familiar with her work \u2013 I\u2019ve read everything she\u2019s published under her own name, some books more than once even, and I\u2019ve long ago stopped being surprised by how consistently good she is.Let\u2019s start with the worldbuilding, shall we? I can be rather nitpicky when it comes to dystopian worlds. I need them to make sense, but sometimes they truly do appear as if they\u2019d been created by YA Dystopia Story Generator. (Hot water has been banned and the government controls fish byproducts, or something along those lines.) But in a world destroyed by a disease, with no government, internet or means of transportation, extremely violent gangs would undoubtedly form, as they did in Deuce\u2019s world. There would surely be groups of people, entire communities that would go back to old values. And some would probably find their way underground, where such a thing is possible. As always, Aguirre\u2019s world is fully realized and flawless. But character development is where the author\u2019s skill truly shows. She doesn\u2019t just point out Deuce\u2019s upbringing when it\u2019s convenient or when it serves to further complicate the plot. She is meticulously consistent, and not just with Deuce, but with all her characters. Not many authors leave me in awe of their insightfulness and intelligence, but somehow, Ann Aguirre always does. She is, above all, an excellent psychologist and she knows her characters to the bone. To call what happens between Fade, Stalker and Deuce a love triangle seems vastly unfair and oversimplified, although I suppose, technically, that\u2019s what it is. It is a triangle of comfort, hope and kindred spirits, and there is nothing simple about it. I may have hated some things that happened in this book with a fiery passion, but I never hated the characters for them! Deuce is amazing, one of those characters that make you want to stand up and do something extraordinary for yourself and for others. She is grown up in some ways, and adolescent in others, naive at times, but a quick learner too. She grew up knowing nothing of how the real world functions, and yet it didn\u2019t take her long to start appreciating family bonds and friendships, or develop her interpersonal intelligence. I suppose I should address the cliffhanger as well, as there\u2019s been a lot of grumbling around the blogosphere. It\u2019s a trilogy, and as much as it pains me, I understand the need to leave things open for the last book. And truth be told, this open ending (not exactly a cliffhanger) is less painful than most. This is, hands down, my favorite book in 2012. I hope I helped the rest of you decide to read it, and soon."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[She went on, \"Anyway, I just didn't want you to think I'd forgotten what we talked about.

Nobody would've touched me while I still drew breath, so there wouldn't have been any unborn brats to lose...yet I would've died. Her path of quieter resistance led to survival through suffering. Tegan wasn't a Huntress, so according to enclave rules, she would've likely been a Breeder if we'd found her, because as Stalker had judged, she had no skills and no visible defects. Yet in the enclave, Breeders didn't fight their roles.\tTegan had. That meant her mother had taught her that she didn't have to bear young for the benefit of the group. Such freedom seemed foreign...and irresponsible. Down below, no one ever hinted that my own desires could be more important than the good of the whole. But that didn't make Tegan mistaken; it meant the Wolves punished her. And that, I did believe, was wrong. So far as I could tell, nobody had invented the perfect system, and it was awful to hurt people who disagreed with you. The enclave had done it too.\n(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Vivian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3964680-vivian", "userReview": "OH MY GOD...i just read the blurbFACEPALM'Outpost' has been infected by the plague terrorizing YA books known as 'Sequel book syndrome'. It'll be jam-packed with love triangle dilemma, where the female 1.0 will be constantly torn between male 1.0 and male 2.0. The book seems it will be in a developed stages of 'Sequel book syndrome'.

It kept me interested since the first chapter. I just liked less analysing sometimes. It was useless. And more description (shockingly). But this book still was great.After being rescued by Longfoot, Deuce and her friends settled in the Salvation and each one of them was \"adopted\" by a family there. Our heroine is living now with the lovely Mama Oaks and her husband. Even though her new parents are so kind, good and even understanding (at least most of the time), she's finding a hard to adapt. Everyone is gossiping about her. Girls are supposed to work at home and work not want to fight and kill Freaks, wear dresses and cashmere instead of pants and gears. She's the intruder here. Fade is acting strangely. He's scarcely talking to her. Only interferes when she's bullied by the natives. And let's not talk about school. She' s fighting material after all and useless for history lessons. Stalker seems to be the only one who understands her and sharing her situation. That's why she's spending most of her time training with him. But it doesn't look like that for the others. Tegan has been clearly avoiding her. Well, who can blame her for wanting to blend?This piece won't last long. Summer is coming and they'll have to plant outside their post. Then collect harvest and visit some nearby towns for goods. When the first attempt was destroyed by Freaks, who seems to only get smarter, they decide to retry and protect the crops this time. They enemies are getting stronger and clearly planning something big and dangerous. But what is it? Deuce is as amazing as ever, even though she times don't get it fast. Fade is just awesome, but he needs to understand her more. Stalker is more likable in this book. And Tegan is surprisingly braver.\n\u201cI want to drag you off and hide you away,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI always knew you were beautiful, but now everyone else will too. I won\u2019t be able to keep other boys away from you, and it\u2019ll make me crazy.\u201d\nI'm sure I'll like Horde, with this ending, it seems so promising. The characters are so good that you forget sometimes that Deuce is only 15-16 years old. While this trilogy is one of my favorites, my hopes are very high for the next book.\u201cPeople try to make sense of things, and if they don\u2019t know the answers, they make them up, because for some, a wrong answer is better than none.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Anagha Uppal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4458145-anagha-uppal", "userReview": "*This review contains some spoilers, especially for those who have not read Enclave*That second paragraph of the synopsis reminds me of Ashes by Ilsa Bick and how much I can't wait to read this book!!!July 26: Just got an ARC of Outpost. Color me excited!!September 27 -This probably sounds redundant because everyone's Outpost reviews are starting with this, but the most important you should get out of this review is that its plot is very unlike Enclave. Whereas Enclave was all about surviving in harsh environments, walking until your whole body felt like it would fall over any second, and fighting for dear life; Outpost focuses on the relationships between characters, emotional development of the teenagers, and learning more about the enemy.Deuce, Fade, Tegan and Stalker has finally found a place that (seems to be) safe and they are relieved to be rid of the danger of Freaks, but there are problems of a different kind at Salvation. For one, Deuce and Fade are so different from the teens here, there are constantly teased and ridiculed. Girls are expected to cook and sew and wear pretty dresses here, and Deuce cannot tolerate these rules. She joins the summer patrols to protect the growers only to be threatened for indecent activities. She does find a family for the first time in her life when she is taken in by a loving and understanding couple - it is here she learns tenderness and devotion and the meaning of love.Once she joins the Outpost to protect the town's crops from the Freaks, Deuce stars noticing strange things such as fire being stolen from the campsite, and she realizes what this means - the Freaks are growing sneaky and more intelligent and they seem to have a personal grudge against the humans! Nobody listens to her, and eventually, her dear Fade and his tent-mate are taken from the campsite to a giant settlement of Freaks and only Deuce and Stalker can save them.Outpost's pace is a lot slower than Enclave and most dystopians I have read, but I suppose that's what makes this book so unique. It is so heartwarming that in the midst of all that despair and danger, one can find a love so pure and honest. What hasn't changed since Enclave is Aguirre's impeccable writing style that makes me jump into Deuce's head and want to stay there :)Deuce is one of the few characters who can successfully pull off being both a kick-ass MC as well as an emotional girl in love. When she talks about her fighting, you can feel the passion radiating off the page, and when she and Fade are together... well, MOAR passionfulness!! Those two have the sweetest relationship ever, up until... well, I can't spoil that.During Enclave, I was all for Fade. I felt like there was no competition at all and Stalker was just a random dude who tried to kiss Deuce. She didn't even like it (much)! It was the same case with Outpost (except you learn just how deep Stalker's feelings do). By the end, though, I really don't know what to think. Fade's still Fade, but Stalker has changed, become deeper and more meaningful. Fade's beautiful and sweet and emotional, while Stalker is loyal and so much like Deuce herself. I really don't know what to make of it.I am dying to know how the Freaks (or Muties) came about and what the humans did to elicit this kind of response. By the end, we are made aware that these aren't just zombies but mutants. I can't wait to join the foursome (together again) on another heart-stopping adventure in Monsters."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16089903-courtney", "userReview": "I have to admit that I am love with this book. I loved Deuce and Fade and I am SOOO glad she made it clear to Stalker early on that things weren't going anywhere between them. I can never get over Stalker being a rapist and I will never see him as a love interest. Plus, he feels very manipulative to me... For instance, when Deuce was going to save Fade and he is all like Kiss me, kiss me before you go... Really, I think that was manipulative, this girl is going to save her boyfriend and all you can think of is getting her to kiss you... Seriously??? Not to mention, he wants her to leave becasue there is nothing to fight or kill in the beginning... Deuce NEEDS the love she finds in Momma Oaks and Edmund, she needs the family unit and she needs Fade... I did hate that Fade went through what he wet through but I understand his response... Noe did I agree with it, no, but I understand it. Think of how many soliders we send to war and who see something that none of their training has prepared them for and come home to the ones they love and they do not know how to express what is going on with them? Ever stop to think that maybe he is traumatized because he being captured made him feel weak? Made him feel like he was no longer \"STRONG\" enough to be what Deuce needs? Maybe he isn't ready to tell Deuce everything that happened? Maybe he doesnt want to feel like she pities him? Maybe he is traumatized because of what he saw becasue he is tired of having to fight for his right to live and wants to settle down and be happy, and seeing the Freaks and what they have planned for the humans makes him lose hope... There is nothing wrong with that especially if he is in love and wants more than to be a hunter for the rest of his days... Not to mention he is 18 years old... Grown men couldnt handle some of what he has seen and he is being called weak for taking a step back and trying to figure things out for himself. I am glad the Deuce is in t for the long haul. Fade needs that and she will prove that love can prevail even in the worse of situations... I hope that their persistence is rewarded in book 3. I am anxious for Horde... I hope that they find what they are looking for and eliminate the Freaks and I hope they find a home..."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19673751-elena", "userReview": "While this is not necessarily one of my favourite trilogies, I still can't wait to see how it ends!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5434285-mary", "userReview": "September 2012?

Let me start with what I think is the biggest flaw of this book. Stalker. In my mind, I keep seeing all the violence on his tab. (Oh how the rape was so not subtly implied!) There's just no redemption nor restitution for such a grave transgression. Comparing him to Fade is a really bad idea. Making him a 'potential' love interest is just downright creepy. Every moment Deuce spends with him makes me cringe. And while I still enjoyed the dynamics of the Fade - Deuce \u201cpartnership\u201d, the Fade - Deuce - Stalker love triangle made my skin crawl. It also pains me to notice how the once ferocious Fade turned into this sappy Edward Cullen clone. It's like seeing Hamlet standing in as Romeo. It's probably the other characters Tegan, Momma Oaks, Edmund, Longshot and the Freaks who saved the story from a train wreck. The storytelling is just not as great as the first installment either. It didn't draw me in the way Enclave did. (I apologize for the comparison for I cannot help it.). Furthermore, there were parts that seem inconsequential to the story. Don't get me wrong, I still think the premise of Outpost was awesome, but the elements of the book just didn't come together the way the first book did. While fans of Ann Aguirre and the Razorland series might still find this book amazing, it just didn\u2019t do it for me. However, I am giving Outost 3 stars, because I loved Enclave, and I am hopeful that somehow the third book will redeem the blunders of Book 2."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2582246-sarah", "userReview": "I won this ARC through a contest on the author's website. This book begins where Enclave left off. Deuce & Co. (Fade, Stalker and Tegan) are now adjusting to life in the topside town of Salvation. Men and women in Salvation stick to their roles...and Deuce is not a fan. She isn't a girly-girl; she's a fighter. As each member of the group works to fit in, we see them growing up in a more traditional sense. All of them have been through so much that they are wise beyond their years. However, relationships and matters of the heart are new to the group. Deuce believes that the population of Salvation is living too soft and not taking the dangers of the Freaks/Muties seriously enough. With the support of her mentor, Longshot, Deuce is able to join the town's guard. We see Deuce attempt to reconcile her tough Huntress nature with her own feminine nature. She grasps the importance of relationships and even cultivates a few within Salvation.I was shocked (though, not completely) with some of the revelations near the end of the book relating to the Freaks/Muties. Deuce & Co. have made it this far. They have no shortage of courage or determination. I loved how the book ended. It was a slightly more positive note and we see the close-knit group band together. Tegan surprised me with her resilience after the horrors of her time with the Wolves.

Deuce is a great character; a strong and confident young woman who strives to know herself better and to grow in her changing environment. As was the case in Enclave, Outpost deals with several complex personal issues in a frank and forthright manner. The lack of angst and drama for the sake of drama in this series is refreshing. The excitement comes from the action in the story, not from unnecessary emotional games.I'm also loving the length of these books. They are well paced and without sections that feel simply like filler. It seems as if in recent years the page counts of YA Spec Fic books are getting bigger (although that certainly isn't limited to YA), and like so many things, more isn't necessarily better. I've been reading this series straight through without feeling any story fatigue or other signs that it is starting to go on longer than it probably needs too.So, off to finish the last book of this quite excellent series!"}, {"userName": "Elisabeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13130014-elisabeth", "userReview": "3 starsI really enjoyed Enclave, however, this one didn't live up to my expectations.

She's not comfortable with the way they expect girls to dress nicely and learn useful skills like cooking and sewing and the town just don't know what to make of her tomboyish ways. It's also hard being treated like a child and expected to go to school when she's spent so many years fending for herself and helping to protect others in her role as a hunter. Things start to look up when she proves she has the skills to be one of the town guards and is given a job helping to protect the farmers during the summer harvest but as the Freaks continue to get smarter and prove a far greater danger than ever before she's going to have her work cut out for her.I'm so glad I've finally made a start on this series, it's one I'm really enjoying and I loved seeing how much Deuce grew as a character in this book. What I love about her is that she accepts that she doesn't know everything and she's willing to ask questions and learn what she needs to. She also knows where her strengths are though and she refuses to let anyone put her in a box just because of her gender. I had to admire her for standing up for what she wanted when it would have been so much easier to go along with the town folk's expectations for her. I felt sorry for her as she struggled to find her place though, Tegan found it so much easier to fit in and preferred to spend time with new friends because Deuce and the others reminded her of a difficult time, Fade is still jealous and is also keeping his distance so the only one it seems like she can really rely on is Stalker.I'll admit I was worried in the first book that it might turn into a dreaded love triangle but I'm convinced now it's not going to happen. Stalker is obviously interested in Deuce but it's very clear she only has feelings for Fade and I can't imagine that changing any time soon. I wasn't at all keen on Stalker's character in the first book - let's face it he's done some horrific and pretty unforgivable things! - but he actually really grew on me in this book. At least he's willing to admit the things he did wrong and he wants to make amends for them and who knows how we would have acted if we'd been born in his shoes. I think one of the things I like most about Deuce is how self aware she is, she recognises that she acts in certain ways because of the way she was raised but she wants to learn and do better and she recognises a similar quality in Stalker. As much as Stalker has grown on me I'm still 100% on team Fade though! I was irritated with him for pushing Deuce away at the beginning of Outpost but he's been through a lot and his insecurities were showing. When it comes down to it he always has Deuce's back when she needs him the most and I love seeing them fight alongside each other.This series is quite brutal and it doesn't shy away from the violence of post-apocalyptic life which makes it feel very believable. There is always plenty of action and I've flown through both books so far so this series certainly didn't suffer with second book syndrome. Ann Aguirre has kept the pacing tight and it's clear she has a solid plan on where the series is going from here. After that ending I'm very interested to see what happens to all the characters next and I'm very glad that I don't have to wait a year for the next book to release before I can read it!"}, {"userName": "oliviasbooks", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843533-oliviasbooks", "userReview": "I breezed through 'Outpost', the sequel to 'Enclave', in a matter of hours and I wish I could go with Deuce and her friends on her next frighteningly dangerous journey through freak-infested territory by devouring 'Horde' right now. It doesn't happen so often that I am that contented with a second/middle volume.I suppose, I definitely could do without the love-triangle - although it's not a very sharp-angled or annoying one since the heroine's preferences are pretty clear and remain that way. Another tiny blotch is the occasional use of words which Deuce with her cut-off-from-topside-life-and-civilization-background should not know yet. The rest has been almost perfect: The post-apocalytic setting, the action, the mystery of the fast evolving zombie freaks, the extraordinarily wonderful heroine, her clashes with an equally strict, but completely different society - world, even - from what she is used to that do not cause her to cower or back down, but also do not tempt her into gloryfying her former life as a Huntress in the College enclave; plus I liked the the accute picture of how circumstances and good or bad experiences form or damage people and how important and necessary second chances can be."}, {"userName": "Stacee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7359586-stacee", "userReview": "I think I enjoyed this one a bit more than Enclave.

There is no Middle Book Syndrome to speak of here. Outpost is all fast-paced action and unpredictable plot twists. But after the insanity in Enclave, I shouldn\u2019t have expected anything less. And legions of Ann Aguirre fans are probably shaking their heads at me, thinking, \u201cI could\u2019ve told you so.\u201dI love that in Outpost, we get to see more of the world top-side and how those survivors are living, as opposed to the glimpses we got in the ruins and in the tunnels in Enclave. Now that Deuce and her companions have been whisked away to Salvation, literally and metaphorically, we get to see the type of life the adult survivors have created for themselves. The amount of time spent expanding upon all facets of Deuce\u2019s world \u2013 new and old \u2013 never seemed cumbersome or tedious, and it served to help characterize the townsfolk and explain why some of them felt as they did toward Deuce. The brief history lessons show the reader that, although the citizens of Salvation have majorly regressed, the setting is North America in the probably not-so-distant future. Something horrific has plagued the country, resulting in the creation of the Freaks\u2026or Muties as the citizenry of Salvation tends to call them. In other words, it was not always this way, and we most likely brought this destruction upon ourselves.Deuce is finding her new life in Salvation rather difficult to acclimate herself to. She has to learn how to navigate friendships, family and love, as well as keep a low profile where some of the townsfolk are concerned, which is easier said than done. Deuce is an ace with her knives, but she\u2019s a novice with her heart. She undergoes more of an emotional journey than a physical one in this novel, and it shows in the growth of her character. But the good people of Salvation do not see things in this respect; they feel that a woman should not wield weapons, nor should she do a man\u2019s work, for fear of bringing the wrath of God down upon them all.And then there\u2019s the matter of Fade. I was glad that these two found each other down in the tunnels. Deuce is the yin to Fade\u2019s yang; he\u2019s the light to her darkness. They are drawn to each other as opposites often are, but because of some misunderstanding, they keep their distance from each other in Salvation. If you\u2019ve seen other reviews, you\u2019ve probably read tales of a love triangle, and yes, the outline for it is there. But I\u2019m still not convinced it exists. Stalker has made his feelings more than clear to Deuce, but Fade is the one who taught Deuce how to love and be kind, and her heart belongs to him. I maintain that Stalker is simply there to complicate matters. Well, that, and the fact that he\u2019s a pretty badass zombie killer himself.This novel had me pondering a lot of things where the end of days are concerned. Would people\u2019s religious beliefs change, for better or worse, should the end of the world prove near? How many of us would resort back to the ways of old? What if it meant the difference between life and death?

A word of caution, there's going to be a lot of adjectives in this review! =) This book has got everything. It's exhiliratingly adventurous, crazy romantic, and very thought-provoking. And the ending is so heart-warming. Really fantastic. I love Deuce. She's an unbelievably courageous heroine. Probably one of the most gutsy characters out there. But to her, her moral code doesn't leave her with much of a choice. Her philosophy is so rich and practical. \u201cIs he the reason you're so set on fighting?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cI think it's the other way around.\u201dHe studied me as if I held all the answers to the mysteries of the universe...I'd never seen such a look, full of melting tenderness and absolute adoration.God, I love Fade. There's just that something about him that's so strong and beautiful. He's one of those characters that can pretty much say anything and I think its sexy and masculine and swoon-worthy. Deuce is still very much on edge even though she lives in safety within the town walls. Her foster parents are kind but most of the townspeople are not. Deuce doesn't trust easy and resists the town's efforts to domesticate her. She does resign herself to some of their traditions though. The problem is that the townspeople see Deuce and her friends as children. Whereas, where she comes from, she's a highly-respected adult. There's also the fact that she is female, and the townspeople expect her to act like one. She has a very aggressive attitude and so she's an outcast. Tegan and Fade make more of an effort to blend in. Deuce doesn't realise that the people close to her want her regard and affection. It's nice to see her opening up and learning to love. Yes, she can be terribly barbaric, but she's also noble, compassionate and selfless. I really loved her simplicity and her plain wisdom. She doesn't understand society's concepts such as birthdays, sleepovers, and education. Stalker and Deuce are alike in many ways and that's why Deuce gravitates towards him. She doesn't want to converge with town life, neither does he. Deuce believes that Stalker's like her because they were both bred for violence. She wants to fight and protect and kick ass, just like she's been trained to do. Okay, sometimes it seems a bit bloodthirsty, but Deuce believes that its her job to protect people and she can't just sit back and let others do the protecting when she's perfectly capable. While Stalker and her are of one mind concerning lifestyles, they most certainly don't agree on their relational status. Stalker's still got a crush on Deuce. And him and Fade are still having this silent fight over her. Fortunately, it doesn't take Fade long to win. Stalker proves to be surprisingly gracious about Deuce's decision though you can see how it hurts him. In this book, Stalker became much more admirable.Fade really loves Deuce and he's very protective over her but he doesn't (or can't) mollycoddle her. Though he absolutely can't stand the mean things people say about her. He's such an interesting character. While he's obviously the dark and broody type, he follows Deuce around like a puppy dog. She makes him so vulnerable because he cares for her so much. I think the author tried to show that in many ways Deuce is much stronger than Fade."}, {"userName": "~Mindy Lynn~", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7320000-mindy-lynn", "userReview": "[ I swear I shed some tears when it came time for them to part ways.

I had come to expect the Freaks to act one way, and when they started changing, it really intrigued me. I love how Aguirre leaves us hanging a little bit with regard to the Freaks, we don't know how they came to be, why they are acting the way they are - I can't wait to read some more.Onto book three : D\u201cLove sounded terrible if it made you so weak, you couldn't survive with out it.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Tessa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7992375-tessa", "userReview": "I read the first book because I saw it recommended next to the Hunger Games. This isn't the same, but I like dystopian stuff so whatever, i read it. I read the first one and didn't really care much for Outpost's description (Deuce has to be trained to be a proper lady and start school? SIGH...), but after about a year I wanted to read something easy and fun, so I bought this book.I felt like this book didn't need to exist. WAIT! Keep reading. It was like everything that happened in this book was so drawn out, kind of cliche, and in the end we were left in the same place as the beginning. What's the point of that? Okay, now we know the Freaks are getting smarter, but what else? Deuce (I hate her name so much omg) has rekindled her flame with Fade after the end of Enclave, Tegan is recovering, Stalker is...whatever. (Stalker has literally done nothing to make me like him but i feel like the author is trying to force me to like him)Thankfully, the whole school thing doesn't last long. I don't think this community, if it was a real place, would actually force her into school for a measly 6 months. I think they'd make an acception to this group of capable kids. (btw: 15??? I wish they were older. 15 is so young.) But whatever, the point is that there isn't much focus on her schooling, so I was thankful.So they head out to do summer patrol and I Aguirre does a good job with the Freaks because I actually do feel grossed out by them. I think I'd rather die than live in this world where everything's so terrible, which is props to the author for making me shiver at the thought of this invented world. I like that Deuce is really showing these guys up, that she's actually teaching them a lesson, and I like her relationship with Longshot. I don't get why this community is so narrow minded and sexist. Why would culture revert to that? That's not a main issue i had though, so I won't go on about it.Ok so then we have them do lots of training and sitting around after the Freaks set up a nasty warning with dead bodies etc etc. I loathe the other men for not taking a proper watch at night when they let Freaks sneak into camp not once but TWICE!! How dumb can you be. You'd think you'd keep your eyes open for the safety of your town and family and for your OWN LIFE!!!What I hate most, though, is how Deuce constantly tries to make Stalker seem like a great guy. \"He did all the awful stuff because he knew no other way\". Ok, I'm sorry, but I will NEVER forget that Stalker is a rapist. The readers are in the 21st century, probably mostly female, and no one in their right mind is going to easily accept what Stalker has done. Yet Deuce tries to convince us (well, the author tries to convince us) that Stalker's a great guy considering. Ohh he was poor and grew up to be like this, wah wah. Nope. I hate him anyway. Also his personality is just not interesting? He's trying to get with Deuce constantly and is too forceful and can't take a hint. Worst of all, I feel like it's being set up that he and Tegan are going to fall in love. I might just vomit everywhere if that happens.Then there's Fade. Aww, Fade, my favourite. I like that he and Deuce get the chance to have some privacy without being on guard. So I have no complaints there....but after he's captured and tortured and he just...becomes another person? And doesn't talk? I was cursing out loud because that is just really dumb. I think Fade, as a soldier whose seen a lot of death, should be handling this better. I think he would talk about it, try to get over it, not just shut down. I feel like his actions went against what we knew about his character already. Maybe I misjudged him.and it ends right where we left off the last book, really. Fade, Tegan, Deuce and Stalker on a journey together. Fade and Deuce not talking to one another. I was really angered by that because their relationships haven't grown. They appeared to be very close but then it dissolved again. Even Stalker STILL wants Deuce!!! Ugh.What I WISH happened was that they found solace at Salvation, the attacks happened quickly, the nonsense about school and dresses was forgotten and they went straight to summer guard because the threat was that big already. Then, halfway through the book, they must journey. Fade is scarred (mentally) but at least TALKING to Deuce, who he SHOULD BE TALKING TO BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL UNDERSTAND, and Stalker keeps apologizing to Tegan and he distances himself from her and never touches her. And at the end of Outpost, what I want to happen is for them to reach some other settlement where the group uncovers some big secret, some plot-turning element that we didn't know about. Like how the Freaks were created, how infested the world is, how we can fix it. Something devastating. And the third book would be about them trying to either cure the Freaks or eliminate them so the world can start over.I know I used a lot of caps in this review, and maybe I sound harsh, but I get very riled up. I think this book was a fun quick read, but maybe I should have waited for the 3rd one to come out so i could have read all three in one go. Now I have to wait a year for the final book, feeling like I've just left off where I was at the end of the first one, which really sucks. I don't look forward to the third one because I feel like this one was so anticlimactic. I'll probably read it anyway UGH.2.5 stars because it was what I expected it to be. Some easy YA dystopian. But it also frustrated the hell out of me."}, {"userName": "\u263d\u2606Jean\u2620BookRampage\u2606\u263e ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9147328-jean-bookrampage", "userReview": "This book was so good.

But, then again in this story the main character Deuce is really young. Outpost begins when Deuce is 15.5 years old. So I enjoyed Enclave, the first in this series, but didn\u2019t love it. I was lukewarm enough about that book that I waited months after the release of Enclave to start it. Ultimately, Enclave addressed all of my concerns about Outpost and is such a better book than the first one in this series. The beginning of the book starts slow. Almost too slow. The set-up explains how Deuce, Stalker, Fade and Teagan are doing in Salvation. Deuce is not happy, Salvation has strict gender division rules and education rules pertaining to children and these pose problems for Deuce. The gender divisions are irritating, almost to the point of not wanting to read about them. However, the book quickly turns the corner from a slow beginning to action upon action mixing in sweet romance and some pretty good town tension. Ann Aguirre\u2019s books spend a lot of time in the minds of the main character. It seems to be her style of writing and both Sirantha Jax and the Corinne Solomon series are similarly done. There are huge passages with only the heroine\u2019s inner monologue going on and the heroine providing explanations for why other people are feeling certain things and doing certain things. At some points it is irritating, some points it is not believable but usually this is very well done. It is an amazing way to learn about the main character and truly be her. One of the problems I had with Enclave was that there was absolutely no explanation as to why society ended and where the freaks came from. Outpost changes all of that. Looking for an explanation of what caused the devastation? Aguirre provides some history in this book and adds a wonderful twist that completely distinguishes the Enclave series from other zombie and post-apoc books. It is enough to say, that this deviation from the standard storyline of the zombie genre makes reading this book worth it \u2013 factor in the emotional development of Deuce and her growing relationships with her friends and this book is a great read. Okay, rape. Ms. Aguirre seems to speak through her characters and attempt to address readers concerns about Stalker and his past actions. Somewhere near the beginning of the story, Deuce has a conversation with Teagan about her abuse at the hand of the Wolves. As I read this section, I felt the author was explaining to the readers and trying to justify Stalker\u2019s presence as an acceptable character despite his past. The reasoning was this \u2013 authority taught the followers of a group (The Wolves \u2013 Stalker and the Enclave \u2013 Deuce) to commit violence in support of the group. The followers of each group (both Stalker and Deuce) bought into these ideas for the betterment of their group. Now that Stalker and Deuce have left these groups they are able to re-evaluate these ideas and their respective roles in the violence they committed. This issue is revisited multiple times throughout the book. At one point Deuce tells Teeagan, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you ever forgive Stalker.\u201d Almost as if Ms. Aguiree is talking to her readers \u2013 you don\u2019t need to forgive Stalker or accept that his background made him do it, you can still enjoy the story. I am not sure if I agree with this concept nor do I accept it. However, I appreciate the author\u2019s willingness to address readers\u2019 concerns. Additionally, Ms. Aguirre doesn\u2019t let Teagan just move on past her past attacks. Realistically, the pain and suffering Teagan endured from the gang rape and beatings from the Wolves is not just pushed under a rug \u2013 but Teeagan continues to suffer from fear of boys and the need to be safe. Outpost ends with a hell of a cliffhanger. Horribly tense yet hopeful. I cannot wait to read #3 in this series."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3594840-karen", "userReview": "Deuce and her friends may be free from the claustrophobic tunnels of the enclave but life is no less confining for her in Salvation, a town that doesn't appreciate the hunter skills which she has honed and perfected.Outpost is very much a character driven novel. I find it fascinating watching how Deuce, Fade, Tegan and Stalker develop in a world where adults have manipulated & abandoned them. Now in Salvation the adults try to save a childhood for the four that has long past. These kids have lived through and survived things that the adults will never understand. The residents know of the Freaks but they have a sense of normalcy with schools, enough food to eat and even families. They \"breed\" for love, a concept that is completely foreign to Deuce.Deuce is one of my all time favorite female characters. She is totally bad ass and knows that the people of Salvation don't understand the severity of the threat from the Freaks. On the other hand she has a bravado that only a teenager can have, thinking they know everything and have seen everything. She's right to an extent, but there is still so much more to learn. The wonderful thing about Deuce is that she's willing to admit when she's wrong, share in the responsibility and ask for help when she needs it. The relationships between the four friends shifts throughout. Salvation is just that - salvation to some but to others it's a false sense of security. The emotions are raw and tender as these children - and yes, I think that's what gets to me the most about this series, is that they are children - try to navigate something as simple as a touch or a kiss while fighting for their lives. I know the tendency is to focus on the romance and you will be richly rewarded on that front, but I'm pleased that Aguirre also pays attention to Tegan and Deuce's relationship. I think we tend to overlook friendships between girlfriends at times and I love the awkwardness and loyalty between these two girls. Now for the real threat. The Freaks. There were a few scenes in the beginning of Outpost that almost\u2026almost\u2026had me sympathizing with them. Or at least maybe humanizing them a tad. But then, holy sh*t! I don't think I've ever been that creeped out before. My heart hurt by the end of Outpost. I was put through an emotional wringer, spit out and sprinkled with a dash of hope.I just can't even fathom what's coming next for my favorite rag tag group of survivors.

Outpost has everything most dystopian fans love; action, savage rotting zombie-like creatures called Freaks (which are freakin disgusting), and a love story. Yes,I admit that it is my least favorite sort of love story (the dreaded love triangle), yet I feel that the author uses it tactfully as a device to emphasize that Deuce is going through some pretty major inner conflict. So that's okay.All of these exciting features are awesome, and the novel can be enjoyed for these qualities alone. In my opinion, however, it is also the amazing world building and character development in Outpost that makes it so special. Instead of the urban underground, where every day is a brutal battle for survival, Deuce finds herself in a safehaven; a settlement inhabited by, according to the author's notes, the descendents of the Pennsylvania Amish. Talk about trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. No longer considered an adult at the age of 15, Deuce is forced to attend school for the first time, wear a dress (although she craftily wears her Hunter garb beneath) and adapt to Salvation's expectations of how a girl her age should act (ie. learn to sew.) She struggles, and fails, to identify with any role except of that of a deadly huntress, responsible for her society's survival. I love how the author uses love as one of the themes of this novel (and not just the romantic type). In her former society, the elders were young as nobody survived past their 20's. Deuce is totally amazed by the fact that people could actually live to middle-age. She is adopted by an older couple and struggles with the fact that they are actually growing to love her. She has no experience with this emotion (with the exception of a little romantic \"sparking\" haha) as she has only vague memories of her \"dam\" and none of her \"sire\". This is beside the point anyway, since her former society did not encourage such emotion, even among the \"breeders\". Her growing familial feelings toward her new family and Longshot are a great source of confusion.There are only shades of grey in this novel. Salvation, like College, is imperfect, as are it's inhabitants. Deuce, Fade and Stalker all took turns irritating me. That's one thing that makes Outpost so believable.
